"Right Dave, what do you want to do now while you're waiting?"
Get really clever!
So how are you gonna get really clever?
I'm going to get two sheets of paper and two pencils .
I haven't got time for a lot of stuff.
Don don't be getting a lot out tonight cos you've got Julie coming.
They're not a lot anyway.
Only two of them each.
Okay.

"Right, I've got the green crayon."
Put it that way.

I mean I used to love me bingo.
"I mean once upon a time nothing was , but I've spent  two and a half thousand pound if not more since I've been off work."
Yeah.
"You know, the dole don't keep us."
Well no.

There's no way I mean
No.

Course it does.
Oh aye course it does yeah.
So I mean we're
And the rest sometimes.

Well
I went down town  yesterday and got some braising steak and it cost me five pounds sixty.
I know.
It's crazy.
And that's just for three of them.
"I mean I, four of them."
I don't eat it you see.
"That's without your  and that's without your bits to go with it, your veg."

I really do like that hat!
"Nine ninety nine, that's good isn't it?"
"you mean I'll think get it when you and me  and you know,"
You'll have to cut up that smaller.
"I know, my, do yo ."
"But you see no, when you think my room, my room's maybe, right say seven feet wi wide right?"
But normally should have a wee bit that goes in  and hole.
"So like, I don't know."
I think you must prefer  everything in that room.
"I know, mum."
You'll have a like  and then you could
That's gone down again ain't it?
Hanging on her now.

Gone are the days .
Do you realize that that's where .
What?
Mm.
"They're prone for that,little red lights."
Oil filter
Mine is an'all.
Have you got a little red light ?
"Yeah, it keeps flickering on and off."
"On me dad's van, that's a pick-up, when she's"
Yeah.
"been running for about half an hour or so, you know when you come to a junction  flicking on and off."
I thought you were a mechanic.
I am.
Well get rid of your little red light then!
I've done it now .
It'd cost a lot of money.
"What, to get rid of a little red light?"
Yeah.
"Well I would do, I'd walk back for , me."
I'd say it's not on now.
Well me dad's needs an oil pump on it.
Er  and he won't pay out for it  cos he's a bit tight.
Er there's mine needs a few bits and bobs  I can't do it though cos I haven't got enough money.
"Me mum's  me mum's is alright, it's just me dad g keeps saying oh there's these noises  and I'll, and I'll go in it and there's no noise."
But it's
His ears are getting old.
I know.
He's supposed to be getting a hearing aid or summat.
Soon as   soon as he starts talking about cars yap yap yap yap yap yap  he doesn't stop.
"Don't worry love it's nice to hear you talk, you carry on."
You're picking on me.
I'm not picking on you.
You're picking on me again.
Picking on me again.
I didn't say that.
I just said are you a driver?
Yeah I am.
Oh I mean you just sound so young to be a driver that's what I was going to say.
Well I am.
You are young?
I am.
You are young.
I am.
Yes you are young.
Yes.
Yeah.
You are also a woman.
I am yes .
Yeah yeah yes yeah.
You're not that blonde one I've noticed driving around and nearly swerved to have a better look at the other day are you?
Well no that just might have been Rachael you were just been talking to.
No she does she says she she wouldn't be allowed to drive she says scatter brain you wouldn't let her drive would you?
.
Mm?
No I can't say anything can I?
Is she your boss?
Sort of yes.
Do you get well paid for this job?
No.
You don't well you don't deserve to get well paid because
Not for all the hassle we get.
for all the time that we have to sit behind you when we're trying to drive around blowing our horns going  get out the way .
Well ninety per cent of the time you shouldn't be where we are cos it's no cars.
Absolute rubbish.
Unless you're a taxi.
Don't they know who I am?
"And as a result I mean to stay a week at Plainfield and come to see you every day , if you will let me ."
"And on my way back to the Bar N I mean to stop off at Plainfield again for another week , and then I shall tell you something more -- something it would be a little too bold to say now , perhaps , although I could say it just as well and truly ."
All this if I may .
"May I , Sidney ? ''"
He bent forward and looked earnestly into her face .
"Sidney felt a new , curious , inexplicable thrill at her heart ."
"`` Oh , yes ."
"-- I suppose so , '' she said shyly ."
"`` Now , take me up to the house and introduce me to your Aunt Jane , '' said John Lincoln in satisfied tone ."
An Adventure on Island Rock `` Who was the man I saw talking to you in the hayfield ? ''
"asked Aunt Kate , as Uncle Richard came to dinner ."
"`` Bob Marks , '' said Uncle Richard briefly ."
`` I 've sold Laddie to him . ''
"Ernest Hughes , the twelve-year-old orphan boy whom Uncle `` boarded and kept '' for the chores he did , suddenly stopped eating ."
"`` Oh , Mr. Lawson , you 're not going to sell Laddie ? ''"
he cried chokily .
Uncle Richard stared at him .
"Never before , in the five years that Ernest had lived with him , had the quiet little fellow spoken without being spoken to , much less ventured to protest against anything Uncle Richard might do ."
"`` Certainly I am , '' answered the latter curtly ."
"`` Bob offered me twenty dollars for the dog , and he 's coming after him next week . ''"
"`` Oh , Mr. Lawson , '' said Ernest , rising to his feet , his small , freckled face crimson ."
"`` Oh , do n't sell Laddie !"
"Please , Mr. Lawson , do n't sell him ! ''"
`` What nonsense is this ? ''
said Uncle Richard sharply .
"He was a man who brooked no opposition from anybody , and who never changed his mind when it was once made up ."
`` Do n't sell Laddie ! ''
pleaded Ernest miserably .
`` He is the only friend I 've got .
I ca n't live if Laddie goes away .
"Oh , do n't sell him , Mr. Lawson ! ''"
"`` Sit down and hold your tongue , '' said Uncle Richard sternly ."
`` Mollie !
Mollie !
After that kiss !
"Fie , fie ! ''"
"`` You are very absurd , '' said Mollie , `` But your absurdity has been amusing ."
"I have -- yes , positively -- I have enjoyed your Eden comedy ."
But now you must not come any further with me .
My aunt might not approve .
Here is my path to Orchard Knob farmhouse .
"There , I presume , is yours to Sweetbriar Cottage ."
Good morning . ''
"`` I am coming over to see you this afternoon , '' said Murray coolly ."
`` But you need n't be afraid .
I will not tell tales out of Eden .
I will be a hypocrite and pretend to Mrs. Palmer that we have never met before .
But you and I will know and remember .
"Now , you may go ."
I reserve to myself the privilege of standing here and watching you out of sight . ''
"* * * * * That afternoon Murray strolled over to Orchard Knob , going into the kitchen without knocking as was the habit in that free and easy world ."
"Mrs. Palmer was lying on the lounge with a pungent handkerchief bound about her head , but keeping a vigilant eye on a very pretty , very plump brown-eyed girl who was stirring a kettleful of cherry preserve on the range ."
"`` Good afternoon , Mrs. Palmer , '' said Murray , wondering where Mollie was ."
`` I 'm sorry to see that you look something like an invalid . ''
"`` I 've a raging , ramping headache , '' said Mrs. Palmer solemnly ."
`` I had it all night and I 'm good for nothing .
"Mollie , you 'd better take them cherries off ."
"Mr. Murray , this is my niece , Mollie Booth . ''"
`` What ? ''
said Murray explosively .
"`` Miss Mollie Booth , '' repeated Mrs. Palmer in a louder tone ."
Murray regained outward self-control and bowed to the blushing Mollie .
`` And what about Eve ? ''
he thought helplessly .
"`` Marry but the man I name to you , and he shall be my lord , and you my lady , before night ."
"For Sir Richard , let me tell you plainly , he will die Sir Richard . ''"
"`` I ask no more of Heaven , my lord , than but to die Sir Richard 's wife , '' returned Joanna ."
"`` Look ye at that , my lord , '' said Gloucester , turning to Lord Foxham ."
`` Here be a pair for you .
"The lad , when for good services I gave him his choice of my favour , chose but the grace of an old , drunken shipman ."
"I did warn him freely , but he was stout in his besottedness ."
"` Here dieth your favour , ' said I ; and he , my lord , with a most assured impertinence , ` Mine be the loss , ' quoth he ."
"It shall be so , by the rood ! ''"
`` Said he so ? ''
cried Alicia .
"`` Then well said , lion-driver ! ''"
`` Who is this ? ''
asked the duke .
"`` A prisoner of Sir Richard 's , '' answered Lord Foxham ; `` Mistress Alicia Risingham . ''"
"`` See that she be married to a sure man , '' said the duke ."
"`` I had thought of my kinsman , Hamley , an it like your grace , '' returned Lord Foxham ."
`` He hath well served the cause . ''
"`` It likes me well , '' said Richard ."
`` Let them be wedded speedily .
"Say , fair maid , will you wed ? ''"
"`` My lord duke , '' said Alicia , `` so as the man is straight '' -- And there , in a perfect consternation , the voice died on her tongue ."
"`` He is straight , my mistress , '' replied Richard , calmly ."
`` I am the only crookback of my party ; we are else passably well shapen .
"Ladies , and you , my lord , '' he added , with a sudden change to grave courtesy , `` judge me not too churlish if I leave you ."
"A captain , in the time of war , hath not the ordering of his hours . ''"
"And with a very handsome salutation he passed on , followed by his officers ."
"`` Alack , '' cried Alicia , `` I am shent ! ''"
"`` Ye know him not , '' replied Lord Foxham ."
`` It is but a trifle ; he hath already clean forgot your words . ''
"`` He is , then , the very flower of knighthood , '' said Alicia ."
"`` Nay , he but mindeth other things , '' returned Lord Foxham ."
"`` Then follow the leader , '' he cried gaily ."
"`` Mind you , I am not sure that we have a drawing-room , but we pretend we have , and it 's all the same ."
Hoop la ! ''
"He went off dancing through the house , and they all cried `` Hoop la ! ''"
"and danced after him , searching for the drawing-room ; and I forget whether they found it , but at any rate they found corners , and they all fitted in ."
"As for Peter , he saw Wendy once again before he flew away ."
"He did not exactly come to the window , but he brushed against it in passing so that she could open it if she liked and call to him ."
That is what she did .
"`` Hullo , Wendy , good-bye , '' he said ."
"`` Oh dear , are you going away ? ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` You do n't feel , Peter , '' she said falteringly , `` that you would like to say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject ? ''"
`` No . ''
"`` About me , Peter ? ''"
`` No . ''
"Mrs. Darling came to the window , for at present she was keeping a sharp eye on Wendy ."
"She told Peter that she had adopted all the other boys , and would like to adopt him also ."
`` Would you send me to school ? ''
he inquired craftily .
`` Yes . ''
`` And then to an office ? ''
`` I suppose so . ''
`` Soon I would be a man ? ''
`` Very soon . ''
"`` I do n't want to go to school and learn solemn things , '' he told her passionately ."
`` I do n't want to be a man .
"O Wendy 's mother , if I was to wake up and feel there was a beard ! ''"
"`` Peter , '' said Wendy the comforter , `` I should love you in a beard ; '' and Mrs. Darling stretched out her arms to him , but he repulsed her ."
"`` Keep back , lady , no one is going to catch me and make me a man . ''"
`` But where are you going to live ? ''
`` With Tink in the house we built for Wendy .
The fairies are to put it high up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights . ''
-- he said he never had any Christmas or New Year at all . ''
`` Poor little fellow ! ''
said the doctor .
"`` I 've heard of him ; a pretty hard time he has of it , I think . ''"
"`` He was so pretty , Papa ."
And Edie gave him her blue mittens for William John . ''
`` The plot deepens .
Who is William John ? ''
"`` Oh , a cousin or something , did n't he say Edie ?"
"Anyway , he is sick , and he wanted to go coasting , and Bertie gave him his mittens ."
And I suppose he never had any Christmas either . ''
"`` There are plenty who have n't , '' said the doctor , taking up his paper with a sigh ."
"`` Well , girlies , you seem interested in this little fellow so , if you like , you may invite him and his cousin to take dinner with you on New Year 's night . ''"
"`` Oh , Papa ! ''"
"said Edith , her eyes shining like stars ."
The doctor laughed .
"`` Write him a nice little note of invitation -- you are the lady of the house , you know -- and I 'll see that he gets it tomorrow . ''"
And this was how it came to pass that Bertie received the next day his first invitation to dine out .
"He read the little note through three times in order fully to take in its contents , and then went around the rest of the day in deep abstraction as though he was trying to decide some very important question ."
It was with the same expression that he opened the door at home in the evening .
His aunt was stirring some oatmeal mush on the stove .
"`` Is that you , Bert ? ''"
She spoke sharply .
"She always spoke sharply , even when not intending it ; it had grown to be a habit ."
"`` Yes 'm , '' said Bertie meekly , as he hung up his cap ."
"`` I s ` pose you 've only got one day more at the store , '' said Mrs. Ross ."
"`` Sampson did n't say anything about keeping you longer , did he ? ''"
`` No .
He said he could n't -- I asked him . ''
"`` Well , I did n't expect he would ."
You 'll have a holiday on New Year 's anyhow ; whether you 'll have anything to eat or not is a different question . ''
"`` I 've an invitation to dinner , '' said Bertie timidly , `` me and William John ."
I could n't look Catherine in the face when she came home .
I 'm so ashamed of myself and I never meant to be so false .
We must never let her suspect for a minute . ''
"`` It 's pretty rough on a fellow , '' said another voice -- Ned 's voice -- in a choked sort of a way ."
"`` Upon my word , Edith , I do n't see how I 'm going to keep it up . ''"
"`` You must , '' sobbed Edith ."
`` It would break her heart -- and Sidney 's too .
"We must just make up our minds to forget each other , Ned , and you must marry Katherine . ''"
Just at this point Katherine became aware that she was eavesdropping and she went away noiselessly .
"She did not look in the least like a person who has received a mortal blow , and she had forgotten her headache altogether ."
"When Edith came up half an hour later , she found the worn-out invalid sitting up and reading a novel ."
"`` How is your headache , dear ? ''"
"she asked , carefully keeping her face turned away from Katherine ."
"`` Oh , it 's all gone , '' said Miss Rangely cheerfully ."
`` Why did n't you come down then ?
Ned was here . ''
"`` Well , Ede , I did go down , but I thought I was n't particularly wanted , so I came back . ''"
"Edith faced her friend in dismay , forgetful of swollen lids and tear-stained cheeks ."
`` Katherine ! ''
"`` Do n't look so conscience stricken , my dear child ."
There is no harm done . ''
`` You heard -- '' `` Some surprising speeches .
So you and Ned have gone and fallen in love with one another ? ''
"`` Oh , Katherine , '' sobbed Edith , `` we -- we -- could n't help it -- but it 's all over ."
"Oh , do n't be angry with me ! ''"
`` Angry ?
"My dear , I 'm delighted . ''"
`` Delighted ? ''
"`` Yes , you dear goose ."
"Ca n't you guess , or must I tell you ?"
"Sidney and I did the very same , and had just such a melancholy parting last night as I suspect you and Ned had tonight . ''"
`` Katherine ! ''
Murray captured a milking stool and rounded up another Jersey .
Before sitting down he seemed struck with an idea .
`` My name is Arnold Murray .
"I board at Sweetbriar Cottage , next farm to Orchard Knob ."
That makes us near neighbours . ''
"`` I suppose it does , '' said Mollie ."
Murray mentally decided that her voice was the sweetest he had ever heard .
He was glad he had arranged his cow at such an angle that he could study her profile .
It was amazing that Mrs. Palmer 's niece should have such a profile .
It looked as if centuries of fine breeding were responsible for it .
`` What a morning ! ''
he said enthusiastically .
`` It harks back to the days when earth was young .
They must have had just such mornings as this in Eden . ''
`` Do you always get up so early ? ''
asked Mollie practically .
"`` Always , '' said Murray without a blush ."
"Then -- `` But no , that is a fib , and I can not tell fibs to you ."
The truth is your tribute .
I never get up early .
It was fate that roused me and brought me here this morning .
"The morning is a miracle -- and you , I might suppose you were born of the sunrise , if Mrs. Palmer had n't told me all about you . ''"
`` What did she tell you about me ? ''
"asked Mollie , changing cows ."
Murray discovered that she was tall and that the big blue print apron shrouded a singularly graceful figure .
`` She said you were the best-looking girl in Bruce county .
"I have seen very few of the girls in Bruce county , but I know she is right . ''"
"`` That compliment is not nearly so pretty as the sunrise one , '' said Mollie reflectively ."
"`` Mrs. Palmer has told me things about you , '' she added ."
"`` Curiosity knows no gender , '' hinted Murray ."
`` She said you were good-looking and lazy and different from other people . ''
"`` All compliments , '' said Murray in a gratified tone ."
Wendy and John had been taken aback somewhat at finding their father in the kennel .
"`` Surely , '' said John , like one who had lost faith in his memory , `` he used not to sleep in the kennel ? ''"
"`` John , '' Wendy said falteringly , `` perhaps we do n't remember the old life as well as we thought we did . ''"
A chill fell upon them ; and serve them right .
"`` It is very careless of mother , '' said that young scoundrel John , `` not to be here when we come back . ''"
It was then that Mrs. Darling began playing again .
`` It 's mother ! ''
"cried Wendy , peeping ."
`` So it is ! ''
said John .
"`` Then are you not really our mother , Wendy ? ''"
"asked Michael , who was surely sleepy ."
`` Oh dear ! ''
"exclaimed Wendy , with her first real twinge of remorse -LSB- for having gone -RSB- , `` it was quite time we came back . ''"
"`` Let us creep in , '' John suggested , `` and put our hands over her eyes . ''"
"But Wendy , who saw that they must break the joyous news more gently , had a better plan ."
"`` Let us all slip into our beds , and be there when she comes in , just as if we had never been away . ''"
"And so when Mrs. Darling went back to the night-nursery to see if her husband was asleep , all the beds were occupied ."
"The children waited for her cry of joy , but it did not come ."
"She saw them , but she did not believe they were there ."
"You see , she saw them in their beds so often in her dreams that she thought this was just the dream hanging around her still ."
"She sat down in the chair by the fire , where in the old days she had nursed them ."
"They could not understand this , and a cold fear fell upon all the three of them ."
`` Mother ! ''
Wendy cried .
"`` That 's Wendy , '' she said , but still she was sure it was the dream ."
`` Mother ! ''
"`` That 's John , '' she said ."
`` Mother ! ''
cried Michael .
He knew her now .
"`` That 's Michael , '' she said , and she stretched out her arms for the three little selfish children they would never envelop again ."
"There 's always one little empty , aching spot ."
"Oh , if I had somebody of my very own to love and care for , a mother , a sister , even a cousin ."
But there 's nobody .
"I have n't a relative in the world , and there are times when I 'd give almost anything to have one ."
"Well , I must try to be satisfied with friendship , instead ."
"Margaret 's meditations were interrupted by a brisk footstep behind her , and presently Dr. Forbes came up ."
"`` Good afternoon , Miss Campbell ."
Taking a constitutional ? ''
`` Yes .
Is n't it a lovely day ?
I suppose you are on your professional rounds .
How are all your patients ? ''
`` Most of them are doing well .
But I 'm sorry to say I have a new one and am very much worried about her .
Do you know Freda Martin ? ''
`` The little teacher in the Primary Department who boards with the Wayes ?
"Yes , I 've met her once or twice ."
Is she ill ? ''
"`` Yes , seriously ."
"It 's typhoid , and she has been going about longer than she should ."
I do n't know what is to be done with her .
"It seems she is like yourself in one respect , Miss Campbell ; she is utterly alone in the world ."
"Mrs. Waye is crippled with rheumatism and ca n't nurse her , and I fear it will be impossible to get a nurse in Blythefield ."
She ought to be taken from the Wayes ' .
"The house is overrun with children , is right next door to that noisy factory , and in other respects is a poor place for a sick girl . ''"
"`` It is too bad , I am very sorry , '' said Margaret sympathetically ."
Dr. Forbes shot a keen look at her from his deep-set eyes .
"`` Are you willing to show your sympathy in a practical form , Miss Campbell ? ''"
he said bluntly .
`` You told me the other day you meant to begin work for others next year .
Why not begin now ?
Here 's a splendid chance to befriend a friendless girl .
The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him .
It is the fairy language .
"You ordinary children can never hear it , but if you were to hear it you would know that you had heard it once before ."
Tink said that the shadow was in the big box .
"She meant the chest of drawers , and Peter jumped at the drawers , scattering their contents to the floor with both hands , as kings toss ha ` pence to the crowd ."
"In a moment he had recovered his shadow , and in his delight he forgot that he had shut Tinker Bell up in the drawer ."
"If he thought at all , but I do n't believe he ever thought , it was that he and his shadow , when brought near each other , would join like drops of water ; and when they did not he was appalled ."
"He tried to stick it on with soap from the bathroom , but that also failed ."
"A shudder passed through Peter , and he sat on the floor and cried ."
"His sobs woke Wendy , and she sat up in bed ."
She was not alarmed to see a stranger crying on the nursery floor ; she was only pleasantly interested .
"` Boy , ' she said courteously , ` why are you crying ? '"
"Peter could be exceedingly polite also , having learned the grand manner at fairy ceremonies , and he rose and bowed to her beautifully ."
"She was much pleased , and bowed beautifully to him from the bed ."
` What 's your name ? '
he asked .
"` Wendy Moira Angela Darling , ' she replied with some satisfaction ."
` What is your name ? '
` Peter Pan . '
"She was already sure that he must be Peter , but it did seem a comparatively short name ."
` Is that all ? '
"` Yes , ' he said rather sharply ."
He felt for the first time that it was a shortish name .
"` I 'm so sorry , ' said Wendy Moira Angela ."
"` It does n't matter , ' Peter gulped ."
She asked where he lived .
"` Second to the right , ' said Peter , ` and then straight on till morning . '"
` What a funny address ! '
Peter had a sinking .
For the first time he felt that perhaps it was a funny address .
"` No , it is n't , ' he said . '"
"I mean , ' Wendy said nicely , remembering that she was hostess , ` is that what they put on the letters ? '"
"Just when it seemed absolutely finished , ` There 's no knocker on the door , ' he said ."
"They were very ashamed , but Tootles gave the sole of his shoe , and it made an excellent knocker ."
"Absolutely finished now , they thought ."
Not a bit of it .
"` There 's no chimney , ' Peter said ; ` we must have a chimney . '"
"` It certainly does need a chimney , ' said John importantly ."
This gave Peter an idea .
"He snatched the hat off John 's head , knocked out the bottom , and put the hat on the roof ."
"The little house was so pleased to have such a capital chimney that , as if to say thank you , smoke immediately began to come out of the hat ."
Now really and truly it was finished .
Nothing remained to do but to knock .
"` All look your best , ' Peter warned them ; ` first impressions are awfully important . '"
He was glad no one asked him what first impressions are ; they were all too busy looking their best .
"He knocked politely ; and now the wood was as still as the children , not a sound to be heard except from Tinker Bell , who was watching from a branch and openly sneering ."
"What the boys were wondering was , would any one answer the knock ?"
"If a lady , what would she be like ?"
The door opened and a lady came out .
It was Wendy .
They all whipped off their hats .
"She looked properly surprised , and this was just how they had hoped she would look ."
` Where am I ? '
she said .
Of course Slightly was the first to get his word in .
"` Wendy lady , ' he said rapidly , ` for you we built this house . '"
"` Oh , say you 're pleased , ' cried Nibs ."
"` Lovely , darling house , ' Wendy said , and they were the very words they had hoped she would say ."
"` And we are your children , ' cried the twins ."
"Then all went on their knees , and holding out their arms cried , ' O Wendy lady , be our mother . '"
` Ought I ? '
"Wendy said , all shining ."
"` Of course it 's frightfully fascinating , but you see I am only a little girl ."
I have no real experience . '
"The front door stood hospitably open , flanked by rows of defiant red and yellow hollyhocks ."
"Harrington paused on the step , with his hand outstretched to knock ."
Somewhere inside he heard a low sobbing .
"Forgetting all about knocking , he stepped softly in and walked to the door of the little sitting-room ."
Bobbles was standing behind him in the middle of the kitchen but Harrington did not see him .
"He was looking at Mary Hayden , who was sitting by the table in the room with her arms flung out over it and her head bowed on them ."
She was crying softly in a hopeless fashion .
Harrington put down his strawberries .
`` Mary ! ''
he exclaimed .
"Mrs. Hayden straightened herself up with a start and looked at him , her lips quivering and her eyes full of tears ."
`` What is the matter ? ''
said Harrington anxiously .
`` Is anything wrong ? ''
"`` Oh , nothing much , '' Said Mrs. Hayden , trying to recover herself ."
"`` Yes , there is too ."
But it is very foolish of me to be going on like this .
I did n't know anyone was near .
And I was feeling so discouraged .
The colt broke his leg in the swamp pasture today and Hiram had to shoot him .
It was Ted 's colt .
"But there , there is no use in crying over it . ''"
"And by way of proving this , the poor , tired , overburdened little woman began to cry again ."
She was past caring whether Harrington saw her or not .
The woman-hater was so distressed that he forgot to be nervous .
He sat down and put his arm around her and spoke out what was in his mind without further parley .
"`` Do n't cry , Mary ."
Listen to me .
You were never meant to run a farm and be killed with worry .
You ought to be looked after and petted .
I want you to marry me and then everything will be all right .
I 've loved you ever since that day I came over here and made you cry .
"`` Isaac Appleby , what do you mean ? ''"
demanded Melissa wrathfully .
Isaac folded his arms and looked up .
"It would be hard to say which face was the more determined , his or the dog 's ."
"But Isaac had the advantage in point of looks , I will say that for him ."
"`` I mean that you two women will stay up on that roof until one of you agrees to marry me , '' said Isaac solemnly ."
I gasped .
"`` Isaac Appleby , you ca n't be in earnest ? ''"
I cried incredulously .
`` You could n't be so mean ? ''
`` I am in earnest .
"I want a wife , and I am going to have one ."
"You two will stay up there , and Julius Caesar here will watch you until one of you makes up her mind to take me ."
"You can settle it between yourselves , and let me know when you have come to a decision . ''"
And with that Isaac walked jauntily into his new house .
`` The man ca n't mean it ! ''
said Melissa .
`` He is trying to play a joke on us . ''
"`` He does mean it , '' I said gloomily ."
`` An Appleby never says anything he does n't mean .
He will keep us here until one of us consents to marry him . ''
"`` It wo n't be me , then , '' said Melissa in a calm sort of rage ."
`` I wo n't marry him if I have to sit on this roof for the rest of my life .
You can take him .
"It 's really you he wants , anyway ; he asked you first . ''"
I always knew that rankled with Melissa .
I thought the situation over before I said anything more .
"We certainly could n't get off that roof , and if we could , there was Julius Caesar ."
"The place was out of sight of every other house in Jersey Cove , and nobody might come near it for a week ."
"To be sure , when Melissa and I did n't turn up the Covites might get out and search for us ; but that would n't be for two or three days anyhow ."
"Melissa had turned her back on me and was sitting with her elbows propped up on her knees , looking gloomily out to sea ."
I was afraid I could n't coax her into marrying Isaac .
"He seemed to muse awhile , holding his lip in his hand , and looking now at me and now upon the causeway of the street ."
"`` Yes , '' says he , `` that will be the best , no doubt . ''"
"And he led me back with him into his house , cried out to some one whom I could not see that he would be engaged all morning , and brought me into a little dusty chamber full of books and documents ."
"Here he sate down , and bade me be seated ; though I thought he looked a little ruefully from his clean chair to my muddy rags ."
"`` And now , '' says he , `` if you have any business , pray be brief and come swiftly to the point ."
Nec gemino bellum Trojanum orditur ab ovo -- do you understand that ? ''
"says he , with a keen look ."
"`` I will even do as Horace says , sir , '' I answered , smiling , `` and carry you in medias res . ''"
"He nodded as if he was well pleased , and indeed his scrap of Latin had been set to test me ."
"For all that , and though I was somewhat encouraged , the blood came in my face when I added : `` I have reason to believe myself some rights on the estate of Shaws . ''"
He got a paper book out of a drawer and set it before him open .
`` Well ? ''
said he .
But I had shot my bolt and sat speechless .
"`` Come , come , Mr. Balfour , '' said he , `` you must continue ."
Where were you born ? ''
"`` In Essendean , sir , '' said I , `` the year 1733 , the 12th of March . ''"
He seemed to follow this statement in his paper book ; but what that meant I knew not .
`` Your father and mother ? ''
said he .
"`` My father was Alexander Balfour , schoolmaster of that place , '' said I , `` and my mother Grace Pitarrow ; I think her people were from Angus . ''"
`` Have you any papers proving your identity ? ''
asked Mr. Rankeillor .
"`` No , sir , '' said I , `` but they are in the hands of Mr. Campbell , the minister , and could be readily produced ."
"Mr. Campbell , too , would give me his word ; and for that matter , I do not think my uncle would deny me . ''"
`` Meaning Mr. Ebenezer Balfour ? ''
says he .
"`` The same , '' said I. `` Whom you have seen ? ''"
he asked .
"`` By whom I was received into his own house , '' I answered ."
`` Did you ever meet a man of the name of Hoseason ? ''
asked Mr. Rankeillor .
I asked .
`` Do ? ''
"said Melissa , snappishly ."
"`` Why , stay here till Isaac Appleby comes out and takes that brute away ?"
What else can we do ? ''
`` What if he is n't at home ? ''
I suggested .
`` We 'll stay here till he comes home .
"Oh , this is a nice predicament ."
This is what comes of cushioning churches ! ''
"`` It might be worse , '' I said comfortingly ."
`` Suppose the roof had n't been flat ? ''
"`` Call Isaac , '' said Melissa shortly ."
"I did n't fancy calling Isaac , but call him I did , and when that failed to bring him Melissa condescended to call , too ; but scream as we might , no Isaac appeared , and that dog sat there and smiled internally ."
"`` It 's no use , '' said Melissa sulkily at last ."
`` Isaac Appleby is dead or away . ''
Half an hour passed ; it seemed as long as a day .
The sun just boiled down on that roof and we were nearly melted .
"We were dreadfully thirsty , and the heat made our heads ache , and I could see my muslin dress fading before my very eyes ."
As for the roses on my best hat -- but that was too harrowing to think about .
Then we saw a welcome sight -- Isaac Appleby coming through the yard with a hoe over his shoulder .
He had probably been working in his field at the back of the house .
I never thought I should have been so glad to see him .
"`` Isaac , oh , Isaac ! ''"
"I called joyfully , leaning over as far as I dared ."
Isaac looked up in amazement at me and Melissa craning our necks over the edge of the roof .
Then he saw the dog and took in the situation .
The creature actually grinned .
"`` Wo n't you call off your dog and let us get down , Isaac ? ''"
I said pleadingly .
Isaac stood and reflected for a moment or two .
"Then he came slowly forward and , before we realized what he was going to do , he took that ladder down and laid it on the ground ."
"` Oo , ' and her arms went out to him ."
"` And you could darn our clothes , and make pockets for us ."
None of us has any pockets . '
How could she resist .
` Of course it 's awfully fascinating ! '
she cried .
"` Peter , would you teach John and Michael to fly too ? '"
"` If you like , ' he said indifferently ; and she ran to John and Michael and shook them ."
"` Wake up , ' she cried , ` Peter Pan has come and he is to teach us to fly . '"
John rubbed his eyes .
"` Then I shall get up , ' he said ."
Of course he was on the floor already .
"` Hallo , ' he said , ' I am up ! '"
"Michael was up by this time also , looking as sharp as a knife with six blades and a saw , but Peter suddenly signed silence ."
Their faces assumed the awful craftiness of children listening for sounds from the grown-up world .
All was as still as salt .
Then everything was right .
"No , stop !"
Everything was wrong .
"Nana , who had been barking distressfully all the evening , was quiet now ."
It was her silence they had heard .
` Out with the light !
Hide !
Quick ! '
"cried John , taking command for the only time throughout the whole adventure ."
"And thus when Liza entered , holding Nana , the nursery seemed quite its old self , very dark ; and you could have sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing angelically as they slept ."
They were really doing it artfully from behind the window curtains .
"Liza was in a bad temper , for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in the kitchen , and had been drawn away from them , with a raisin still on her cheek , by Nana 's absurd suspicions ."
"She thought the best way of getting a little quiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment , but in custody of course ."
"` There , you suspicious brute , ' she said , not sorry that Nana was in disgrace , ` they are perfectly safe , are n't they ?"
Every one of the little angels sound asleep in bed .
Listen to their gentle breathing . '
"But now he knew her ; now , even in that ungainly dress , she smiled upon him , bright with love ; and his heart was transported with joy ."
"`` Sweetheart , '' he said , `` if ye forgive this blunderer , what care I ?"
"Make we direct for Holywood ; there lieth your good guardian and my better friend , Lord Foxham ."
"There shall we be wed ; and whether poor or wealthy , famous or unknown , what , matters it ?"
"This day , dear love , I won my spurs ; I was commended by great men for my valour ; I thought myself the goodliest man of war in all broad England ."
"Then , first , I fell out of my favour with the great ; and now have I been well thrashed , and clean lost my soldiers ."
There was a downfall for conceit !
"But , dear , I care not -- dear , if ye still love me and will wed , I would have my knighthood done away , and mind it not a jot . ''"
`` My Dick ! ''
she cried .
`` And did they knight you ? ''
"`` Ay , dear , ye are my lady now , '' he answered , fondly ; `` or ye shall , ere noon to-morrow -- will ye not ? ''"
"`` That will I , Dick , with a glad heart , '' she answered ."
"`` Ay , sir ?"
Methought ye were to be a monk ! ''
said a voice in their ears .
`` Alicia ! ''
cried Joanna .
"`` Even so , '' replied the young lady , coming forward ."
"`` Alicia , whom ye left for dead , and whom your lion-driver found , and brought to life again , and , by my sooth , made love to , if ye want to know ! ''"
"`` I 'll not believe it , '' cried Joanna ."
`` Dick ! ''
`` Dick ! ''
mimicked Alicia .
"`` Dick , indeed !"
"Ay , fair sir , and ye desert poor damsels in distress , '' she continued , turning to the young knight ."
`` Ye leave them planted behind oaks .
But they say true -- the age of chivalry is dead . ''
"`` Madam , '' cried Dick , in despair , `` upon my soul I had forgotten you outright ."
"Madam , ye must try to pardon me ."
"Ye see , I had new found Joanna ! ''"
"`` I did not suppose that ye had done it o ' purpose , '' she retorted ."
"She is a pretty lady , but not so pretty as my mother ."
"Her mouth is full of thimbles , but not so full as my mother 's was . ''"
Of course he knew nothing whatever about his mother ; but he sometimes bragged about her .
"He did not know the tune , which was `` Home , Sweet Home , '' but he knew it was saying , `` Come back , Wendy , Wendy , Wendy '' ; and he cried exultantly , `` You will never see Wendy again , lady , for the window is barred ! ''"
"He peeped in again to see why the music had stopped , and now he saw that Mrs. Darling had laid her head on the box , and that two tears were sitting on her eyes ."
"`` She wants me to unbar the window , '' thought Peter , `` but I wo n't , not I ! ''"
"He peeped again , and the tears were still there , or another two had taken their place ."
"`` She 's awfully fond of Wendy , '' he said to himself ."
He was angry with her now for not seeing why she could not have Wendy .
The reason was so simple : `` I 'm fond of her too .
"We ca n't both have her , lady . ''"
"But the lady would not make the best of it , and he was unhappy ."
"He ceased to look at her , but even then she would not let go of him ."
"He skipped about and made funny faces , but when he stopped it was just as if she were inside him , knocking ."
"`` Oh , all right , '' he said at last , and gulped ."
Then he unbarred the window .
"`` Come on , Tink , '' he cried , with a frightful sneer at the laws of nature ; `` we do n't want any silly mothers ; '' and he flew away ."
"Thus Wendy and John and Michael found the window open for them after all , which of course was more than they deserved ."
"They alighted on the floor , quite unashamed of themselves , and the youngest one had already forgotten his home ."
"`` John , '' he said , looking around him doubtfully , `` I think I have been here before . ''"
"`` Of course you have , you silly ."
There is your old bed . ''
"`` So it is , '' Michael said , but not with much conviction ."
"`` I say , '' cried John , `` the kennel ! ''"
and he dashed across to look into it .
"`` Perhaps Nana is inside it , '' Wendy said ."
But John whistled .
"`` Hullo , '' he said , `` there 's a man inside it . ''"
`` It 's father ! ''
exclaimed Wendy .
"`` Let me see father , '' Michael begged eagerly , and he took a good look ."
"`` He is not so big as the pirate I killed , '' he said with such frank disappointment that I am glad Mr. Darling was asleep ; it would have been sad if those had been the first words he heard his little Michael say ."
"Donning his hat at its most rakish angle , he wound his cloak around him , holding one end in front as if to conceal his person from the night , of which it was the blackest part , and muttering strangely to himself , stole away through the trees ."
Peter slept on .
"The light guttered -LSB- burned to edges -RSB- and went out , leaving the tenement in darkness ; but still he slept ."
"It must have been not less than ten o'clock by the crocodile , when he suddenly sat up in his bed , wakened by he knew not what ."
It was a soft cautious tapping on the door of his tree .
"Soft and cautious , but in that stillness it was sinister ."
Peter felt for his dagger till his hand gripped it .
Then he spoke .
`` Who is that ? ''
For long there was no answer : then again the knock .
`` Who are you ? ''
No answer .
"He was thrilled , and he loved being thrilled ."
In two strides he reached the door .
"Unlike Slightly 's door , it filled the aperture -LSB- opening -RSB- , so that he could not see beyond it , nor could the one knocking see him ."
"`` I wo n't open unless you speak , '' Peter cried ."
"Then at last the visitor spoke , in a lovely bell-like voice ."
"`` Let me in , Peter . ''"
"It was Tink , and quickly he unbarred to her ."
"She flew in excitedly , her face flushed and her dress stained with mud ."
`` What is it ? ''
"`` Oh , you could never guess ! ''"
"she cried , and offered him three guesses ."
`` Out with it ! ''
"he shouted , and in one ungrammatical sentence , as long as the ribbons that conjurers -LSB- magicians -RSB- pull from their mouths , she told of the capture of Wendy and the boys ."
Peter 's heart bobbed up and down as he listened .
"Wendy bound , and on the pirate ship ; she who loved everything to be just so !"
`` I 'll rescue her ! ''
"he cried , leaping at his weapons ."
As he leapt he thought of something he could do to please her .
He could take his medicine .
His hand closed on the fatal draught .
"Think of that , Sophia Crawford '' -- Susan shook a floury finger at Sophia -- `` not -- one -- child -- under -- eight -- years -- of -- age ! ''"
"`` I suppose the Germans has et 'em all , '' sighed Cousin Sophia ."
"`` Well , no-o-o , '' said Susan reluctantly , as if she hated to admit that there was any crime the Huns could n't be accused of ."
`` The Germans have not turned cannibal yet -- as far as I know .
"They have died of starvation and exposure , the poor little creatures ."
"There is murdering for you , Cousin Sophia Crawford ."
The thought of it poisons every bite and sup I take . ''
"`` I see that Fred Carson of Lowbridge has been awarded a Distinguished Conduct Medal , '' remarked the doctor , over his local paper ."
"`` I heard that last week , '' said Susan ."
`` He is a battalion runner and he did something extra brave and daring .
"His letter , telling his folks about it , came when his old Grandmother Carson was on her dying-bed ."
"She had only a few minutes more to live and the Episcopal minister , who was there , asked her if she would not like him to pray ."
"` Oh yes , yes , you can pray , ' she said impatient-like -- she was a Dean , Dr. dear , and the Deans were always high-spirited -- ` you can pray , but for pity 's sake pray low and do n't disturb me ."
I want to think over this splendid news and I have not much time left to do it . '
That was Almira Carson all over .
Fred was the apple of her eye .
"She was seventy-five years of age and had not a grey hair in her head , they tell me . ''"
"`` By the way , that reminds me -- I found a grey hair this morning -- my very first , '' said Mrs. Blythe ."
"`` I have noticed that grey hair for some time , Mrs. Dr. dear , but I did not speak of it ."
"Thought I to myself , ` She has enough to bear . '"
But now that you have discovered it let me remind you that grey hairs are honourable . ''
"`` I must be getting old , Gilbert . ''"
Mrs. Blythe laughed a trifle ruefully .
`` People are beginning to tell me I look so young .
They never tell you that when you are young .
But I shall not worry over my silver thread .
I never liked red hair .
"Gilbert , did I ever tell you of that time , years ago at Green Gables , when I dyed my hair ?"
Nobody but Marilla and I knew about it . ''
`` Was that the reason you came out once with your hair shingled to the bone ? ''
`` Yes .
I bought a bottle of dye from a German Jew pedlar .
"Without any waste of words , Alan plunged abruptly into the subject ."
"`` Miss Oliver , why have you avoided me so of late ?"
Have I done anything to offend you ? ''
`` No . ''
"She spoke as if the word hurt her , her eyes persistently cast down ."
`` Then what is the trouble ? ''
There was no answer .
She gave an unvoluntary glance around as if seeking some way of escape .
"There was none , for the spring was set about with thick young firs and Alan blocked the only path ."
He leaned forward and took her hands in his .
"`` Miss Oliver , you must tell me what the trouble is , '' he said firmly ."
"She pulled her hands away and flung them up to her face , her form shaken by stormy sobs ."
In distress he put his arm about her and drew her closer .
"`` Tell me , Lynde , '' he whispered tenderly ."
"She broke away from him , saying passionately , `` You must not come to Four Winds any more ."
You must not have anything more to do with us -- any of us .
We have done you enough harm already .
"But I never thought it could hurt you -- oh , I am sorry , sorry ! ''"
"`` Miss Oliver , I want to see that letter you received the other evening ."
Oh '' -- as she started with surprise -- `` I know about it -- Emily told me .
Who wrote it ? ''
"`` There was no name signed to it , '' she faltered ."
`` Just as I thought .
"Well , you must let me see it . ''"
`` I can not -- I burned it . ''
`` Then tell me what was in it .
You must .
This matter must be cleared up -- I am not going to have our beautiful friendship spoiled by the malice of some coward .
What did that letter say ? ''
`` It said that everybody in your congregation was talking about your frequent visits here -- that it had made a great scandal -- that it was doing you a great deal of injury and would probably end in your having to leave Rexton . ''
"`` That would be a catastrophe indeed , '' said Alan drily ."
"`` Well , what else ? ''"
"O , a great stroke ! ''"
"he sobbed , and rattled off a leash of prayers ."
Hatch meanwhile reverently doffed his salet and knelt down .
"`` Ay , Bennet , '' said the priest , somewhat recovering , `` and what may this be ?"
What enemy hath done this ? ''
"`` Here , Sir Oliver , is the arrow ."
"See , it is written upon with words , '' said Dick ."
"`` Nay , '' cried the priest , `` this is a foul hearing !"
John Amend-All !
A right Lollardy word .
"And black of hue , as for an omen !"
"Sirs , this knave arrow likes me not ."
But it importeth rather to take counsel .
Who should this be ?
"Bethink you , Bennet ."
"Of so many black ill-willers , which should he be that doth so hardily outface us ?"
Simnel ?
I do much question it .
The Walsinghams ?
"Nay , they are not yet so broken ; they still think to have the law over us , when times change ."
"There was Simon Malmesbury , too ."
"How think ye , Bennet ? ''"
"`` What think ye , sir , '' returned Hatch , `` of Ellis Duckworth ? ''"
"`` Nay , Bennet , never ."
"Nay , not he , '' said the priest ."
"`` There cometh never any rising , Bennet , from below -- so all judicious chroniclers concord in their opinion ; but rebellion travelleth ever downward from above ; and when Dick , Tom , and Harry take them to their bills , look ever narrowly to see what lord is profited thereby ."
"Now , Sir Daniel , having once more joined him to the Queen 's party , is in ill odour with the Yorkist lords ."
"Thence , Bennet , comes the blow -- by what procuring , I yet seek ; but therein lies the nerve of this discomfiture . ''"
"`` A n't please you , Sir Oliver , '' said Bennet , `` the axles are so hot in this country that I have long been smelling fire ."
"So did this poor sinner , Appleyard ."
"And , by your leave , men 's spirits are so foully inclined to all of us , that it needs neither York nor Lancaster to spur them on ."
"Hear my plain thoughts : You , that are a clerk , and Sir Daniel , that sails on any wind , ye have taken many men 's goods , and beaten and hanged not a few ."
"`` Nay , y ' are the best heart in England ; I but laughed ."
"Forgive me now , sweet Dick . ''"
"`` Nay , no fool words , '' returned Dick , a little embarrassed by his companion 's warmth ."
`` No harm is done .
"I am not touchy , praise the saints . ''"
"And at that moment the wind , which was blowing straight behind them as they went , brought them the rough flourish of Sir Daniel 's trumpeter ."
`` Hark ! ''
"said Dick , `` the tucket soundeth . ''"
"`` Ay , '' said Matcham , `` they have found my flight , and now I am unhorsed ! ''"
and he became pale as death .
"`` Nay , what cheer ! ''"
returned Dick .
"`` Y ' have a long start , and we are near the ferry ."
"And it is I , methinks , that am unhorsed . ''"
"`` Alack , I shall be taken ! ''"
cried the fugitive .
"`` Dick , kind Dick , beseech ye help me but a little ! ''"
"`` Why , now , what aileth thee ? ''"
said Dick .
`` Methinks I help you very patently .
But my heart is sorry for so spiritless a fellow !
"And see ye here , John Matcham -- sith John Matcham is your name -- I , Richard Shelton , tide what betideth , come what may , will see you safe in Holywood ."
The saints so do to me again if I default you .
"Come , pick me up a good heart , Sir White-face ."
The way betters here ; spur me the horse .
Go faster !
faster !
"Nay , mind not for me ; I can run like a deer . ''"
"So , with the horse trotting hard , and Dick running easily alongside , they crossed the remainder of the fen , and came out upon the banks of the river by the ferryman 's hut ."
"CHAPTER III -- THE FEN FERRY The river Till was a wide , sluggish , clayey water , oozing out of fens , and in this part of its course it strained among some score of willow-covered , marshy islets ."
"It was a dingy stream ; but upon this bright , spirited morning everything was become beautiful ."
The wind and the martens broke it up into innumerable dimples ; and the reflection of the sky was scattered over all the surface in crumbs of smiling blue .
They discussed the matter at the tea table .
"`` I 'll be glad when the auction is over , '' said Marilla ."
`` It is too much responsibility having so much stock about the place and nobody but that unreliable Martin to look after them .
He has never come back yet and he promised that he would certainly be back last night if I 'd give him the day off to go to his aunt 's funeral .
"I do n't know how many aunts he has got , I am sure ."
That 's the fourth that 's died since he hired here a year ago .
I 'll be more than thankful when the crop is in and Mr. Barry takes over the farm .
"We 'll have to keep Dolly shut up in the pen till Martin comes , for she must be put in the back pasture and the fences there have to be fixed ."
"I declare , it is a world of trouble , as Rachel says ."
Here 's poor Mary Keith dying and what is to become of those two children of hers is more than I know .
"She has a brother in British Columbia and she has written to him about them , but she has n't heard from him yet . ''"
`` What are the children like ?
How old are they ? ''
`` Six past ... they 're twins . ''
"`` Oh , I 've always been especially interested in twins ever since Mrs. Hammond had so many , '' said Anne eagerly ."
`` Are they pretty ? ''
"`` Goodness , you could n't tell ... they were too dirty ."
Davy had been out making mud pies and Dora went out to call him in .
"Davy pushed her headfirst into the biggest pie and then , because she cried , he got into it himself and wallowed in it to show her it was nothing to cry about ."
Mary said Dora was really a very good child but that Davy was full of mischief .
He has never had any bringing up you might say .
His father died when he was a baby and Mary has been sick almost ever since . ''
"`` I 'm always sorry for children that have no bringing up , '' said Anne soberly ."
`` You know I had n't any till you took me in hand .
I hope their uncle will look after them .
Just what relation is Mrs. Keith to you ? ''
`` Mary ?
None in the world .
It was her husband ... he was our third cousin .
There 's Mrs. Lynde coming through the yard .
I thought she 'd be up to hear about Mary . ''
"`` Do n't tell her about Mr. Harrison and the cow , '' implored Anne ."
"asked Jill , who kept all her questions for Frank , because she seldom alluded to the tender subject when with Jack ."
"`` No , he 's off for the summer ."
Got a place somewhere .
Hope he 'll stay there and let Bob alone . ''
`` Where is Bob now ?
"I do n't hear much about him lately , '' said Jill , who was constantly on the lookout for `` the other fellow , '' since it was not Joe ."
"`` Oh , he went to Captain Skinner 's the first of March , chores round , and goes to school up there ."
"Captain is strict , and wo n't let Bob come to town , except Sundays ; but he do n't mind it much , for he likes horses , has nice grub , and the Hill fellows are good chaps for him to be with ."
"So he 's all right , if he only behaves . ''"
`` How far is it to Captain Skinner 's ? ''
"asked Jill suddenly , having listened , with her sharp eyes on Frank , as he tinkered away at his model , since he was forbidden all other indulgence in his beloved pastime ."
"`` It 's four miles to Hill District , but the Captain lives this side of the school-house ."
"About three from here , I should say . ''"
`` How long would it take a boy to walk up there ? ''
"went on the questioner , with a new idea in her head ."
`` Depends on how much of a walkist he is . ''
"`` Suppose he was lame and it was sloshy , and he made a call and came back ."
How long would that take ? ''
asked Jill impatiently .
"`` Well , in that case , I should say two or three hours ."
"But it 's impossible to tell exactly , unless you know how lame the fellow was , and how long a call he made , '' said Frank , who liked to be accurate ."
"`` Jack could n't do it in less , could he ? ''"
"`` He used to run up that hilly road for a breather , and think nothing of it ."
"It would be a long job for him now , poor little chap , for his leg often troubles him , though he hates to own it . ''"
"Jill lay back and laughed , a happy little laugh , as if she was pleased about something , and Frank looked over his shoulder to ask questions in his turn ."
`` What are you laughing at ? ''
`` Ca n't tell . ''
`` Why do you want to know about Hill District ?
Are you going there ? ''
`` Wish I could !
I 'd soon have it out of him . ''
`` Who ? ''
Uncle Dick wrote to me to return home at once and pay my court to the lady ; I protested .
"He wrote again -- a letter , short and the reverse of sweet ."
If I refused to do my best to win Miss Mannering he would disown me -- never speak to me again -- cut me off with a quarter .
"Uncle always means what he says -- that is one of our family traits , you understand ."
"I spent some miserable , undecided days ."
"It was not the threat of disinheritance that worried me , although when you have been brought up to regard yourself as a prospective millionaire it is rather difficult to adjust your vision to a pauper focus ."
But it was the thought of alienating Uncle Dick .
"I love the dear , determined old chap like a father ."
But last night my guardian angel was with me and I decided to remain my own man .
"So I wrote to Uncle Dick , respectfully but firmly declining to become a candidate for Miss Mannering 's hand . ''"
"`` But you have never seen her , '' said Mollie ."
`` She may be -- almost -- charming . '' ''
"` If she be not fair to me , what care I how fair she be ? ' ''"
quoted Murray .
"`` As you say , she may be -- almost charming ; but she is not Eve ."
"She is merely one of a million other women , as far as I am concerned ."
Do n't let 's talk of her .
Let us talk only of ourselves -- there is nothing else that is half so interesting . ''
`` And will your uncle really cast you off ? ''
asked Mollie .
`` Not a doubt of it . ''
`` What will you do ? ''
"`` Work , dear Eve ."
My carefully acquired laziness must be thrown to the winds and I shall work .
That is the rule outside of Eden .
Do n't worry .
I 've painted pictures that have actually been sold .
I 'll make a living for us somehow . ''
`` Us ? ''
`` Of course .
You are engaged to me . ''
"`` I am not , '' said Mollie indignantly ."
"Not just an ordinary letter ; dear me , no ."
"I took a whole day to write it , and you should have seen the postmistress 's eyes stick out when I mailed it ."
I just told her everything that had happened in Greenvale since she went away .
I made it as newsy and cheerful and loving as I possibly could .
Everything bright and funny I could think of went into it .
`` The next was old Aunt Kitty .
"You know she was my nurse when I was a baby , and she 's very fond of me ."
"But , well , you know , Aunt Emmy , I 'm ashamed to confess it , but really I 've never found Aunt Kitty very entertaining , to put it mildly ."
"She is always glad when I go to see her , but I 've never gone except when I could n't help it ."
"She is very deaf , and rather dull and stupid , you know ."
"Well , I gave her a whole day ."
"I took my knitting yesterday , and sat with her the whole time and just talked and talked ."
I told her all the Greenvale news and gossip and everything else I thought she 'd like to hear .
She was so pleased and proud ; she told me when I came away that she had n't had such a nice time for years .
`` Then there was ... Florence .
"You know , Aunt Emmy , we were always intimate friends until last year ."
Then Florence once told Rose Watson something I had told her in confidence .
I found it out and I was so hurt .
"I could n't forgive Florence , and I told her plainly I could never be a real friend to her again ."
"Florence felt badly , because she really did love me , and she asked me to forgive her , but it seemed as if I could n't ."
"Well , Aunt Emmy , that was my Christmas gift to her ... my forgiveness ."
I went down last night and just put my arms around her and told her that I loved her as much as ever and wanted to be real close friends again .
`` I gave Aunt Mary her gift this morning .
"I told her I was n't going to Murraybridge , that I just meant to stay home with her ."
"She was so glad -- and I 'm glad , too , now that I 've decided so . ''"
"`` Your gifts have been real gifts , Clorinda , '' said Aunt Emmy ."
`` Something of you -- the best of you -- went into each of them . ''
Clorinda went out and brought her cornery armful in .
"`` I did n't forget you , Aunt Emmy , '' she said , as she unpinned the paper ."
There was a rosebush -- Clorinda 's own pet rosebush -- all snowed over with fragrant blossoms .
Aunt Emmy loved flowers .
She put her finger under one of the roses and kissed it .
THANK you .
I told Clarice Almira that I was sure it was only a misunderstanding and that a word would set it right .
Donnell ... accent on the last syllable ... and St. Clair ... on no account Jacob .
You 'll remember ?
THANK you . ''
When Mrs. H. B. DonNELL had skimmed away Anne locked the school door and went home .
At the foot of the hill she found Paul Irving by the Birch Path .
He held out to her a cluster of the dainty little wild orchids which Avonlea children called `` rice lillies . ''
"`` Please , teacher , I found these in Mr. Wright 's field , '' he said shyly , `` and I came back to give them to you because I thought you were the kind of lady that would like them , and because ... '' he lifted his big beautiful eyes ... `` I like you , teacher . ''"
"`` You darling , '' said Anne , taking the fragrant spikes ."
"As if Paul 's words had been a spell of magic , discouragement and weariness passed from her spirit , and hope upwelled in her heart like a dancing fountain ."
"She went through the Birch Path light-footedly , attended by the sweetness of her orchids as by a benediction ."
"`` Well , how did you get along ? ''"
Marilla wanted to know .
`` Ask me that a month later and I may be able to tell you .
I ca n't now ... I do n't know myself ... I 'm too near it .
My thoughts feel as if they had been all stirred up until they were thick and muddy .
The only thing I feel really sure of having accomplished today is that I taught Cliffie Wright that A is A .
He never knew it before .
Is n't it something to have started a soul along a path that may end in Shakespeare and Paradise Lost ? ''
Mrs. Lynde came up later on with more encouragement .
That good lady had waylaid the schoolchildren at her gate and demanded of them how they liked their new teacher .
"`` And every one of them said they liked you splendid , Anne , except Anthony Pye ."
I must admit he did n't .
"He said you ` were n't any good , just like all girl teachers . '"
There 's the Pye leaven for you .
But never mind . ''
"`` I 'm not going to mind , '' said Anne quietly , `` and I 'm going to make Anthony Pye like me yet ."
Patience and kindness will surely win him . ''
"`` Well , you can never tell about a Pye , '' said Mrs. Rachel cautiously ."
"`` They go by contraries , like dreams , often as not ."
"As for that DonNELL woman , she 'll get no DonNELLing from me , I can assure you ."
It 's from Doctor Forbes 's little girls -- the ones that gave me the mittens . ''
"He handed her the little note , and Mrs. Ross stooped down and read it by the fitful gleam of light which came from the cracked stove ."
"`` Well , you can please yourself , '' she said as she handed it back , `` but William John could n't go if he had ten invitations ."
He caught cold coasting yesterday .
"I told him he would , but he was bound to go , and now he 's laid up for a week ."
Listen to him barking in the bedroom there . ''
"`` Well , then , I wo n't go either , '' said Bertie with a sigh , it might be of relief , or it might be of disappointment ."
`` I would n't go there all alone . ''
`` You 're a goose ! ''
said his aunt .
`` They would n't eat you .
"But as I said , please yourself ."
"Anyhow , hold your tongue about it to William John , or you 'll have him crying and bawling to go too . ''"
The caution came too late .
"William John had already heard it , and when his mother went in to rub his chest with liniment , she found him with the ragged quilt over his head crying ."
"`` Come , William John , I want to rub you . ''"
"`` I do n't want to be rubbed -- g ` way , '' sobbed William John ."
`` I heard you out there -- you need n't think I did n't .
Bertie 's going to Doctor Forbes 's to dinner and I ca n't go . ''
"`` Well , you 've only yourself to thank for it , '' returned his mother ."
"`` If you had n't persisted in going out coasting yesterday when I wanted you to stay in , you 'd have been able to go to Doctor Forbes 's ."
Little boys who wo n't do as they 're told always get into trouble .
"Stop crying , now ."
"I dare say if Bertie goes they 'll send you some candy , or something . ''"
But William John refused to be comforted .
"He cried himself to sleep that night , and when Bertie went in to see him next morning , he found him sitting up in bed with his eyes red and swollen and the faded quilt drawn up around his pinched face ."
"`` Well , William John , how are you ? ''"
"`` I ai n't any better , '' replied William John mournfully ."
"`` I s ` pose you 'll have a great time tomorrow night , Bertie ? ''"
"`` Oh , I 'm not going since you ca n't , '' said Bertie cheerily ."
"He thought this would comfort William John , but it had exactly the opposite effect ."
"William John had cried until he could cry no more , but he turned around and sobbed ."
"`` Are all the children chained , so that they can not fly away ? ''"
"`` Ay , ay . ''"
`` Then hoist them up . ''
"The wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold , all except Wendy , and ranged in line in front of him ."
For a time he seemed unconscious of their presence .
"He lolled at his ease , humming , not unmelodiously , snatches of a rude song , and fingering a pack of cards ."
Ever and anon the light from his cigar gave a touch of colour to his face .
"`` Now then , bullies , '' he said briskly , `` six of you walk the plank to-night , but I have room for two cabin boys ."
Which of you is it to be ? ''
"`` Do n't irritate him unnecessarily , '' had been Wendy 's instructions in the hold ; so Tootles stepped forward politely ."
"Tootles hated the idea of signing under such a man , but an instinct told him that it would be prudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person ; and though a somewhat silly boy , he knew that mothers alone are always willing to be the buffer ."
"All children know this about mothers , and despise them for it , but make constant use of it ."
"So Tootles explained prudently , `` You see , sir , I do n't think my mother would like me to be a pirate ."
"Would your mother like you to be a pirate , Slightly ? ''"
"He winked at Slightly , who said mournfully , `` I do n't think so , '' as if he wished things had been otherwise ."
"`` Would your mother like you to be a pirate , Twin ? ''"
"`` I do n't think so , '' said the first twin , as clever as the others ."
"`` Nibs , would -- '' `` Stow this gab , '' roared Hook , and the spokesmen were dragged back ."
"`` You , boy , '' he said , addressing John , `` you look as if you had a little pluck in you ."
"Didst never want to be a pirate , my hearty ? ''"
Now John had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths .
prep. ; and he was struck by Hook 's picking him out .
"`` I once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack , '' he said diffidently ."
`` And a good name too .
"We 'll call you that here , bully , if you join . ''"
"`` What do you think , Michael ? ''"
asked John .
`` What would you call me if I join ? ''
Michael demanded .
`` Blackbeard Joe . ''
Michael was naturally impressed .
"`` What do you think , John ? ''"
Anne kept a sober face until she got downstairs and then she collapsed on the sitting room lounge and laughed until her sides ached .
"`` I wish you 'd tell me the joke , '' said Marilla , a little grimly ."
`` I have n't seen much to laugh at today . ''
"`` You 'll laugh when you hear this , '' assured Anne ."
"And Marilla did laugh , which showed how much her education had advanced since the adoption of Anne ."
But she sighed immediately afterwards .
"`` I suppose I should n't have told him that , although I heard a minister say it to a child once ."
But he did aggravate me so .
It was that night you were at the Carmody concert and I was putting him to bed .
He said he did n't see the good of praying until he got big enough to be of some importance to God .
"Anne , I do not know what we are going to do with that child ."
I never saw his beat .
I 'm feeling clean discouraged . ''
"`` Oh , do n't say that , Marilla ."
Remember how bad I was when I came here . ''
"`` Anne , you never were bad ... NEVER ."
"I see that now , when I 've learned what real badness is ."
"You were always getting into terrible scrapes , I 'll admit , but your motive was always good ."
Davy is just bad from sheer love of it . ''
"`` Oh , no , I do n't think it is real badness with him either , '' pleaded Anne ."
`` It 's just mischief .
"And it is rather quiet for him here , you know ."
He has no other boys to play with and his mind has to have something to occupy it .
Dora is so prim and proper she is no good for a boy 's playmate .
"I really think it would be better to let them go to school , Marilla . ''"
"`` No , '' said Marilla resolutely , `` my father always said that no child should be cooped up in the four walls of a school until it was seven years old , and Mr. Allan says the same thing ."
The twins can have a few lessons at home but go to school they sha n't till they 're seven . ''
"`` Well , we must try to reform Davy at home then , '' said Anne cheerfully ."
`` With all his faults he 's really a dear little chap .
I ca n't help loving him .
"Marilla , it may be a dreadful thing to say , but honestly , I like Davy better than Dora , for all she 's so good . ''"
"`` I do n't know but that I do , myself , '' confessed Marilla , `` and it is n't fair , for Dora is n't a bit of trouble ."
Then the talk drifted around to Edith 's affairs .
"She was engaged to a certain Sidney Keith , who was a professor in some college ."
"`` I do n't expect to see much of Sidney this summer , '' said Edith ."
`` He 's writing another book .
He is so terribly addicted to literature . ''
"`` How lovely , '' sighed Katherine , who had aspirations in that line herself ."
`` If only Ned were like him I should be perfectly happy .
But Ned is so prosaic .
"He does n't care a rap for poetry , and he laughs when I enthuse ."
It makes him quite furious when I talk of taking up writing seriously .
He says women writers are an abomination on the face of the earth .
Did you ever hear anything so ridiculous ? ''
"`` He is very handsome , though , '' said Edith , with a glance at his photograph on Katherine 's dressing table ."
`` And that is what Sid is not .
"He is rather distinguished looking , but as plain as he can possibly be . ''"
Edith sighed .
She had a weakness for handsome men and thought it rather hard that fate should have allotted her so plain a lover .
"`` He has lovely eyes , '' said Katherine comfortingly , `` and handsome men are always vain ."
Even Ned is .
I have to snub him regularly .
But I think you 'll like him . ''
Edith thought so too when Ned Ellison appeared that night .
"He was a handsome off-handed young fellow , who seemed to admire Katherine immensely , and be a little afraid of her into the bargain ."
"`` Edith will try to make Riverton pleasant for you while I am away , '' she told him in their good-bye chat ."
"`` She is a dear girl -- you 'll like her , I know ."
"It 's really too bad I have to go away now , but it ca n't be helped . ''"
"`` I shall be awfully lonesome , '' grumbled Ned ."
"`` Do n't you forget to write regularly , Kitty . ''"
"`` Of course I 'll write , but for pity 's sake , Ned , do n't call me Kitty ."
It sounds so childish .
"Well , bye-bye , dear boy ."
I 'll be back in two months and then we 'll have a lovely time . ''
And we must make other things too .
I 'll help you in the morning .
"But I ca n't help you in the afternoon for I have to make a wedding-dress and time is the essence of the contract , Susan . ''"
Susan felt that she was really too old to be subjected to such shocks .
"`` Who are you going to marry , Rilla ? ''"
she asked feebly .
"`` Susan , darling , I am not the happy bride ."
Miranda Pryor is going to marry Joe Milgrave tomorrow afternoon while her father is away in town .
"A war-wedding , Susan -- is n't that thrilling and romantic ?"
I never was so excited in my life . ''
"The excitement soon spread over Ingleside , infecting even Mrs. Blythe and Susan ."
"`` I 'll go to work on that cake at once , '' vowed Susan , with a glance at the clock ."
"`` Mrs. Dr. dear , will you pick over the fruit and beat up the eggs ?"
If you will I can have that cake ready for the oven by the evening .
Tomorrow morning we can make salads and other things .
I will work all night if necessary to get the better of Whiskers-on-the-moon . ''
"Miranda arrived , tearful and breathless ."
"`` We must fix over my white dress for you to wear , '' said Rilla ."
`` It will fit you very nicely with a little alteration . ''
"To work went the two girls , ripping , fitting , basting , sewing for dear life ."
By dint of unceasing effort they got the dress done by seven o'clock and Miranda tried it on in Rilla 's room .
"`` It 's very pretty -- but oh , if I could just have a veil , '' sighed Miranda ."
`` I 've always dreamed of being married in a lovely white veil . ''
Some good fairy evidently waits on the wishes of war-brides .
"The door opened and Mrs. Blythe came in , her arms full of a filmy burden ."
"`` Miranda dear , '' she said , `` I want you to wear my wedding-veil tomorrow ."
"It is twenty-four years since I was a bride at old Green Gables -- the happiest bride that ever was -- and the wedding-veil of a happy bride brings good luck , they say . ''"
"`` Oh , how sweet of you , Mrs. Blythe , '' said Miranda , the ready tears starting to her eyes ."
The veil was tried on and draped .
Susan dropped in to approve but dared not linger .
"`` I 've got that cake in the oven , '' she said , `` and I am pursuing a policy of watchful waiting ."
The evening news is that the Grand Duke has captured Erzerum .
"He wanted John to decide , and John wanted him to decide ."
`` Shall we still be respectful subjects of the King ? ''
John inquired .
"Through Hook 's teeth came the answer : `` You would have to swear , ` Down with the King . ' ''"
"Perhaps John had not behaved very well so far , but he shone out now ."
"`` Then I refuse , '' he cried , banging the barrel in front of Hook ."
"`` And I refuse , '' cried Michael ."
`` Rule Britannia ! ''
squeaked Curly .
"The infuriated pirates buffeted them in the mouth ; and Hook roared out , `` That seals your doom ."
Bring up their mother .
Get the plank ready . ''
"They were only boys , and they went white as they saw Jukes and Cecco preparing the fatal plank ."
But they tried to look brave when Wendy was brought up .
No words of mine can tell you how Wendy despised those pirates .
To the boys there was at least some glamour in the pirate calling ; but all that she saw was that the ship had not been tidied for years .
There was not a porthole on the grimy glass of which you might not have written with your finger `` Dirty pig '' ; and she had already written it on several .
"But as the boys gathered round her she had no thought , of course , save for them ."
"`` So , my beauty , '' said Hook , as if he spoke in syrup , `` you are to see your children walk the plank . ''"
"Fine gentlemen though he was , the intensity of his communings had soiled his ruff , and suddenly he knew that she was gazing at it ."
"With a hasty gesture he tried to hide it , but he was too late ."
`` Are they to die ? ''
"asked Wendy , with a look of such frightful contempt that he nearly fainted ."
"`` They are , '' he snarled ."
"`` Silence all , '' he called gloatingly , `` for a mother 's last words to her children . ''"
At this moment Wendy was grand .
"`` These are my last words , dear boys , '' she said firmly ."
"`` I feel that I have a message to you from your real mothers , and it is this : ` We hope our sons will die like English gentlemen . ' ''"
"Even the pirates were awed , and Tootles cried out hysterically , `` I am going to do what my mother hopes ."
"What are you to do , Nibs ? ''"
`` What my mother hopes .
"What are you to do , Twin ? ''"
Emily was quite sincere .
"Lynde had not told her , and Emily did not recognize him ."
"`` Well , Mr. Douglas did a brave thing in rescuing him , '' said Dr. Ames ."
`` I 'll be back tomorrow . ''
Harmon remained delirious for a week .
"Alan went every day to Four Winds , his interest in a man he had rescued explaining his visits to the Rexton people ."
"The Captain had returned and , though not absolutely uncivil , was taciturn and moody ."
Alan reflected grimly that Captain Anthony probably owed him a grudge for saving Harmon 's life .
"He never saw Lynde alone , but her strained , tortured face made his heart ache ."
Old Emily only seemed her natural self .
She waited on Harmon and Dr. Ames considered her a paragon of a nurse .
Alan thought it was well that Emily knew nothing more of Harmon than that he was an old friend of Captain Anthony 's .
"He felt sure that she would have walked out of the sick room and never reentered it had she guessed that the patient was the man whom , above all others , Lynde dreaded and feared ."
One afternoon when Alan went to Four Winds Emily met him at the door .
"`` He 's better , '' she announced ."
`` He had a good sleep this afternoon and when he woke he was quite himself .
You 'd better go up and see him .
I told him all I could but he wants to see you .
Anthony and Lynde are away to Crosse Harbour .
Go up and talk to him . ''
Harmon turned his head as the minister approached and held out his hand with a smile .
"`` You 're the preacher , I reckon ."
They tell me you were the man who pulled me out of that hurly-burly .
I was n't hardly worth saving but I 'm as grateful to you as if I was . ''
"`` I only -- did -- what any man would have done , '' said Alan , taking the offered hand ."
`` I do n't know about that .
"Anyhow , it 's not every man could have done it ."
I 'd been hanging in that rigging all day and most of the night before .
There were five more of us but they dropped off .
I knew it was no use to try to swim ashore alone -- the backwater would be too much for me .
I must have been a lot of trouble .
That old woman says I 've been raving for a week .
"Oh no , he just tormented her refined womanhood to the verge of frenzy , that was all ."
He died when you were a baby .
"And a year later I found out your mother could love me , rough sailor and all as I was ."
I married her and brought her here .
We had fifteen years of happiness together .
I 'm not a good man -- but I made your mother happy in spite of her wrecked health and her dark memories .
"It was her wish that you should be known as my daughter , but under the present circumstances I know she would wish that you should be told the truth ."
"Marry your man , Lynde , and go away with him ."
Emily will go with you if you like .
I 'm going back to the sea .
I 've been hankering for it ever since your mother died .
I 'll go out of your life .
"There , do n't cry -- I hate to see a woman cry ."
"Mr. Douglas , I 'll leave you to dry her tears and I 'll go up to the house and have a talk with Harmon . ''"
"When Captain Anthony had disappeared behind the Point , Alan turned to Lynde ."
She was sobbing softly and her face was wet with tears .
Alan drew her head down on his shoulder .
"`` Sweetheart , the dark past is all put by ."
Our future begins with promise .
"All is well with us , dear Lynde . ''"
"Like a child , she put her arms about his neck and their lips met ."
Marcella 's Reward Dr. Clark shook his head gravely .
"`` She is not improving as fast as I should like to see , '' he said ."
`` In fact -- er -- she seems to have gone backward the past week .
"You must send her to the country , Miss Langley ."
The heat here is too trying for her . ''
"Dr. Clark might as well have said , `` You must send her to the moon '' -- or so Marcella thought bitterly ."
Despair filled her heart as she looked at Patty 's white face and transparent hands and listened to the doctor 's coolly professional advice .
Patty 's illness had already swept away the scant savings of three years .
Marcella had nothing left with which to do anything more for her .
She did not make any answer to the doctor -- she could not .
"Besides , what could she say , with Patty 's big blue eyes , bigger and bluer than ever in her thin face , looking at her so wistfully ?"
Christopher shook his head .
"`` No , I understand they 're not on very good terms ."
Sara do n't like Charles Stuart or his wife -- and I do n't blame her .
"She wo n't stay there , not likely ."
Probably she 'll go and live in town .
Strange she never married .
"She was reckoned handsome , and had plenty of beaus at one time . ''"
Jeffrey swung out of the group and started homeward with his dog .
To stand by and hear Sara Stuart discussed after this fashion was more than he could endure .
"The men idly watched his tall , erect figure as he went along the valley ."
"`` Queer chap , Jeff , '' said Alec Churchill reflectively ."
"`` Jeff 's all right , '' said Christopher in a patronizing way ."
`` There ai n't a better man or neighbour alive .
"I 've lived next farm to him for thirty years , so I ought to know ."
But he 's queer sartainly -- not like other people -- kind of unsociable .
He do n't care for a thing ` cept dogs and reading and mooning round woods and fields .
"That ai n't natural , you know ."
But I must say he 's a good farmer .
"He 's got the best farm in Bayside , and that 's a real nice house he put up on it ."
Ai n't it an odd thing he never married ?
Never seemed to have no notion of it .
I ca n't recollect of Jeff Miller 's ever courting anybody .
That 's another unnatural thing about him . ''
"`` I 've always thought that Jeff thought himself a cut or two above the rest of us , '' said Tom Scovel with a sneer ."
`` Maybe he thinks the Bayside girls ai n't good enough for him . ''
"`` There ai n't no such dirty pride about Jeff , '' pronounced Christopher conclusively ."
"`` And the Millers are the best family hereabouts , leaving the kunnel 's out ."
"And Jeff 's well off -- nobody knows how well , I reckon , but I can guess , being his land neighbour ."
"Jeff ai n't no fool nor loafer , if he is a bit queer . ''"
"Meanwhile , the object of these remarks was striding homeward and thinking , not of the men behind him , but of Sara Stuart ."
He must go to her at once .
"He had not intruded on her since her father 's death , thinking her sorrow too great for him to meddle with ."
"The boy started , stopped and looked out towards Island Rock ."
The next moment he hailed me .
"It was Ernest 's voice , and it was Laddie who was barking beside him ."
"`` Ernest , '' I shouted wildly , `` run for help -- quick !"
quick !
The tide will be over the rock in half an hour !
"Hurry , or you will be too late ! ''"
"Instead of starting off at full speed , as I expected him to do , Ernest stood still for a moment , and then began to pick his steps down a narrow path over the cliff , followed by Laddie ."
"`` Ernest , '' I shouted frantically , `` what are you doing ?"
Why do n't you go for help ? ''
Ernest had by this time reached a narrow ledge of rock just above the water-line .
I noticed that he was carrying something over his arm .
"`` It would take too long , '' he shouted ."
"`` By the time I got to the Cove and a boat could row back here , you 'd be drowned ."
Laddie and I will save you .
Is there anything there you can tie a rope to ?
I 've a coil of rope here that I think will be long enough to reach you .
I 've been down to the Cove and Alec Martin sent it up to your uncle . ''
"I looked about me ; a smooth , round hole had been worn clean through a thin part of the apex of the rock ."
`` I could fasten the rope if I had it ! ''
I called .
`` But how can you get it to me ? ''
For answer Ernest tied a bit of driftwood to the rope and put it into Laddie 's mouth .
The next minute the dog was swimming out to me .
As soon as he came close I caught the rope .
"It was just long enough to stretch from shore to rock , allowing for a couple of hitches which Ernest gave around a small boulder on the ledge ."
"I tied my camera case on my head by means of some string I found in my pocket , then I slipped into the water and , holding to the rope , went hand over hand to the shore with Laddie swimming beside me ."
"Ernest held on to the shoreward end of the rope like grim death , a task that was no light one for his small arms ."
"When I finally scrambled up beside him , his face was dripping with perspiration and he trembled like a leaf ."
"`` Ern , you are a brick ! ''"
I exclaimed .
`` You 've saved my life ! ''
"Do n't you tell me I 'm like that old gossip , '' said Mr. Harrison irritably ."
`` I 'm not ... not a bit .
What have you got in that box ? ''
"`` A cake , '' said Anne archly ."
In her relief at Mr. Harrison 's unexpected amiability her spirits soared upward feather-light .
`` I brought it over for you ... I thought perhaps you did n't have cake very often . ''
"`` I do n't , that 's a fact , and I 'm mighty fond of it , too ."
I 'm much obliged to you .
It looks good on top .
I hope it 's good all the way through . ''
"`` It is , '' said Anne , gaily confident ."
"`` I have made cakes in my time that were NOT , as Mrs. Allan could tell you , but this one is all right ."
"I made it for the Improvement Society , but I can make another for them . ''"
"`` Well , I 'll tell you what , miss , you must help me eat it ."
I 'll put the kettle on and we 'll have a cup of tea .
How will that do ? ''
`` Will you let me make the tea ? ''
said Anne dubiously .
Mr. Harrison chuckled .
`` I see you have n't much confidence in my ability to make tea .
You 're wrong ... I can brew up as good a jorum of tea as you ever drank .
But go ahead yourself .
"Fortunately it rained last Sunday , so there 's plenty of clean dishes . ''"
Anne hopped briskly up and went to work .
She washed the teapot in several waters before she put the tea to steep .
"Then she swept the stove and set the table , bringing the dishes out of the pantry ."
"The state of that pantry horrified Anne , but she wisely said nothing ."
Mr. Harrison told her where to find the bread and butter and a can of peaches .
Anne adorned the table with a bouquet from the garden and shut her eyes to the stains on the tablecloth .
"Soon the tea was ready and Anne found herself sitting opposite Mr. Harrison at his own table , pouring his tea for him , and chatting freely to him about her school and friends and plans ."
She could hardly believe the evidence of her senses .
"Mr. Harrison had brought Ginger back , averring that the poor bird would be lonesome ; and Anne , feeling that she could forgive everybody and everything , offered him a walnut ."
"`` Ai n't you gone yet , Bert ? ''"
she said sharply .
`` What in the world are you hanging round for ? ''
"`` It 's early yet , '' said Bertie cheerfully ."
`` I thought maybe George Fraser 'd be along and I 'd get a lift as far as the store . ''
"`` Well , I never saw such laziness !"
No wonder old Sampson wo n't keep you longer than the holidays if you 're no smarter than that .
"Goodness , if I do n't settle that boy ! ''"
-- as the sound of fretful crying came from the kitchen behind her .
`` What is wrong with William John ? ''
asked Bertie .
"`` Why , he wants to go out coasting with those Robinson boys , but he ca n't ."
He has n't got any mittens and he would catch his death of cold again . ''
Her voice seemed to imply that William John had died of cold several times already .
"Bertie looked soberly down at his old , well-darned mittens ."
"It was very cold , and he would have a great many errands to run ."
"He shivered , and looked up at his aunt 's hard face as she stood wiping her dish-pan with a grim frown which boded no good to the discontented William John ."
Then he suddenly pulled off his mittens and held them out .
`` Here -- he can have mine .
I 'll get on without them well enough . ''
`` Nonsense ! ''
"said Mrs. Ross , but less unkindly ."
`` The fingers would freeze off you .
Do n't be a goose . ''
"`` It 's all right , '' persisted Bertie ."
`` I do n't need them -- much .
And William John does n't hardly ever get out . ''
"He thrust them into her hand and ran quickly down the street , as though he feared that the keen air might make him change his mind in spite of himself ."
He had to stop a great many times that day to breathe on his purple hands .
"Still , he did not regret having lent his mittens to William John -- poor , pale , sickly little William John , who had so few pleasures ."
It was sunset when Bertie laid an armful of parcels down on the steps of Doctor Forbes 's handsome house .
"His back was turned towards the big bay window at one side , and he was busy trying to warm his hands , so he did not see the two small faces looking at him through the frosty panes ."
"An I had known , I should have seen the varlet hanged ere I had told him ."
"Well , if he goes through the fen , I may come up with him and pull his ears . ''"
"Half an hour later , Sir Daniel gave Dick the letter , and bade him speed to the Moat House ."
"And , again , some half an hour after Dick 's departure , a messenger came , in hot haste , from my Lord of Risingham ."
"`` Sir Daniel , '' the messenger said , `` ye lose great honour , by my sooth !"
"The fight began again this morning ere the dawn , and we have beaten their van and scattered their right wing ."
Only the main battle standeth fast .
"An we had your fresh men , we should tilt you them all into the river ."
"What , sir knight !"
Will ye be the last ?
It stands not with your good credit . ''
"`` Nay , '' cried the knight , `` I was but now upon the march ."
"Selden , sound me the tucket ."
"Sir , I am with you on the instant ."
"It is not two hours since the more part of my command came in , sir messenger ."
What would ye have ?
"Spurring is good meat , but yet it killed the charger ."
"Bustle , boys ! ''"
"By this time the tucket was sounding cheerily in the morning , and from all sides Sir Daniel 's men poured into the main street and formed before the inn ."
"They had slept upon their arms , with chargers saddled , and in ten minutes five-score men-at-arms and archers , cleanly equipped and briskly disciplined , stood ranked and ready ."
"The chief part were in Sir Daniel 's livery , murrey and blue , which gave the greater show to their array ."
"The best armed rode first ; and away out of sight , at the tail of the column , came the sorry reinforcement of the night before ."
Sir Daniel looked with pride along the line .
"`` Here be the lads to serve you in a pinch , '' he said ."
"`` They are pretty men , indeed , '' replied the messenger ."
`` It but augments my sorrow that ye had not marched the earlier . ''
"`` Well , '' said the knight , `` what would ye ?"
"The beginning of a feast and the end of a fray , sir messenger ; '' and he mounted into his saddle ."
`` Why !
how now ! ''
he cried .
`` John !
cried Dick .
`` Would ye mind a ducking ?
Blood of wound or dust of travel -- that 's a man 's adornment . ''
"`` Nay , then , I like him better plain , '' observed the lad ."
"`` But , prithee , how shall I do ?"
"Prithee , good Master Richard , help me with your good counsel ."
"If I come not safe to Holywood , I am undone . ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Dick , dismounting , `` I will give more than counsel ."
"Take my horse , and I will run awhile , and when I am weary we shall change again , that so , riding and running , both may go the speedier . ''"
"So the change was made , and they went forward as briskly as they durst on the uneven causeway , Dick with his hand upon the other 's knee ."
`` How call ye your name ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` Call me John Matcham , '' replied the lad ."
`` And what make ye to Holywood ? ''
Dick continued .
"`` I seek sanctuary from a man that would oppress me , '' was the answer ."
`` The good Abbot of Holywood is a strong pillar to the weak . ''
"`` And how came ye with Sir Daniel , Master Matcham ? ''"
pursued Dick .
"`` Nay , '' cried the other , `` by the abuse of force !"
"He hath taken me by violence from my own place ; dressed me in these weeds ; ridden with me till my heart was sick ; gibed me till I could ` a ' wept ; and when certain of my friends pursued , thinking to have me back , claps me in the rear to stand their shot !"
"I was even grazed in the right foot , and walk but lamely ."
"Nay , there shall come a day between us ; he shall smart for all ! ''"
`` Would ye shoot at the moon with a hand-gun ? ''
said Dick . ''
"'T is a valiant knight , and hath a hand of iron ."
"An he guessed I had made or meddled with your flight , it would go sore with me . ''"
"`` Ay , poor boy , '' returned the other , `` y ' are his ward , I know it ."
"By the same token , so am I , or so he saith ; or else he hath bought my marriage -- I wot not rightly which ; but it is some handle to oppress me by . ''"
`` Boy again ! ''
said Dick .
"`` Nay , then , shall I call you girl , good Richard ? ''"
"Wo n't you be frank with me , dear ?"
Do you honestly think you can never learn to love me ? ''
"`` It is not that , '' said Lynde in a hard , unnatural voice ."
`` I am married already . ''
"Alan stared at her , not in the least comprehending the meaning of her words ."
"Everything -- pain , hope , fear , passion -- had slipped away from him for a moment , as if he had been stunned by a physical blow ."
He could not have heard aright .
`` Married ? ''
he said dully .
"`` Lynde , you can not mean it ? ''"
"`` Yes , I do ."
I was married three years ago . ''
`` Why was I not told this ? ''
"Alan 's voice was stern , although he did not mean it to be so , and she shrank and shivered ."
Then she began in a low monotonous tone from which all feeling of any sort seemed to have utterly faded .
"`` Three years ago Mother was very ill -- so ill that any shock would kill her , so the doctor Father brought from the lake told us ."
A man -- a young sea captain -- came here to see Father .
His name was Frank Harmon and he had known Father well in the past .
They had sailed together .
Father seemed to be afraid of him -- I had never seen him afraid of anybody before .
"I could not think much about anybody except Mother then , but I knew I did not quite like Captain Harmon , although he was very polite to me and I suppose might have been called handsome ."
One day Father came to me and told me I must marry Captain Harmon .
I laughed at the idea at first but when I looked at Father 's face I did not laugh .
It was all white and drawn .
He implored me to marry Captain Harmon .
He said if I did not it would mean shame and disgrace for us all -- that Captain Harmon had some hold on him and would tell what he knew if I did not marry him .
I do n't know what it was but it must have been something dreadful .
And he said it would kill Mother .
"I knew it would , and that was what drove me to consent at last ."
"Oh , I ca n't tell you what I suffered ."
I was only seventeen and there was nobody to advise me .
One day Father and Captain Harmon and I went down the lake to Crosse Harbour and we were married there .
Do n't you think it 's about time I joined up ? ''
The pale mother looked at him .
`` Two of my sons have gone and one will never return .
"Must I give you too , Shirley ? ''"
The age-old cry -- `` Joseph is not and Simeon is not ; and ye will take Benjamin away . ''
How the mothers of the Great War echoed the old Patriarch 's moan of so many centuries agone !
"`` You would n't have me a slacker , mother ?"
I can get into the flying-corps .
"What say , dad ? ''"
The doctor 's hands were not quite steady as he folded up the powders he was concocting for Abbie Flagg 's rheumatism .
"He had known this moment was coming , yet he was not altogether prepared for it ."
"He answered slowly , `` I wo n't try to hold you back from what you believe to be your duty ."
But you must not go unless your mother says you may . ''
Shirley said nothing more .
He was not a lad of many words .
"Anne did not say anything more just then , either ."
"She was thinking of little Joyce 's grave in the old burying-ground over-harbour -- little Joyce who would have been a woman now , had she lived -- of the white cross in France and the splendid grey eyes of the little boy who had been taught his first lessons of duty and loyalty at her knee -- of Jem in the terrible trenches -- of Nan and Di and Rilla , waiting -- waiting -- waiting , while the golden years of youth passed by -- and she wondered if she could bear any more ."
She thought not ; surely she had given enough .
Yet that night she told Shirley that he might go .
They did not tell Susan right away .
"She did not know it until , a few days later , Shirley presented himself in her kitchen in his aviation uniform ."
Susan did n't make half the fuss she had made when Jem and Walter had gone .
"She said stonily , `` So they 're going to take you , too . ''"
`` Take me ?
No .
"I 'm going , Susan -- got to . ''"
"Susan sat down by the table , folded her knotted old hands , that had grown warped and twisted working for the Ingleside children to still their shaking , and said : `` Yes , you must go ."
"I did not see once why such things must be , but I can see now . ''"
"`` You 're a brick , Susan , '' said Shirley ."
"He was relieved that she took it so coolly -- he had been a little afraid , with a boy 's horror of `` a scene . ''"
"He went out whistling gaily ; but half an hour later , when pale Anne Blythe came in , Susan was still sitting there ."
"`` Mrs. Dr. dear , '' said Susan , making an admission she would once have died rather than make , `` I feel very old ."
I hereby punish you by prompt departure from Orchard Knob .
"Yet I do not dislike audacity , at some times , in some places , in some people ."
It is only from a sense of duty that I punish it in this case .
And it was really pleasant in Eden .
"If you do not mail that letter , and if you still persist in your very absurd interpretation of the meaning of Eve 's kiss , we may meet again in town ."
"Until then I remain , `` Very sincerely yours , `` Dora Lynne Mannering . ''"
Murray kissed the grey letter and put it tenderly away in his pocket .
Then he took his letter to his uncle and tore it into tiny fragments .
Finally he looked at his watch .
"`` If I hurry , I can catch the afternoon train to town , '' he said ."
"Aunt Susanna 's Birthday Celebration Good afternoon , Nora May ."
I 'm real glad to see you .
I 've been watching you coming down the hill and I hoping you 'd turn in at our gate .
Going to visit with me this afternoon ?
That 's good .
I 'm feeling so happy and delighted and I 've been hankering for someone to tell it all to .
Tell you about it ?
"Well , I guess I might as well ."
It ai n't any breach of confidence .
You did n't know Anne Douglas ?
"She taught school here three years ago , afore your folks moved over from Talcott ."
She belonged up Montrose way and she was only eighteen when she came here to teach .
She boarded with us and her and me were the greatest chums .
She was just a sweet girl .
"She was the prettiest teacher we ever had , and that 's saying a good deal , for Springdale has always been noted for getting good-looking schoolmarms , just as Miller 's Road is noted for its humly ones ."
"Anne had yards of brown wavy hair and big , dark blue eyes ."
"Her face was kind o ' pale , but when she smiled you would have to smile too , if you 'd been chief mourner at your own funeral ."
"She was a well-spring of joy in the house , and we all loved her ."
Gilbert Martin began to drive her the very first week she was here .
"Gilbert is my sister Julia 's son , and a fine young fellow he is ."
"It ai n't good manners to brag of your own relations , but I 'm always forgetting and doing it ."
Gil was a great pet of mine .
"`` No , sir , '' replied the captain , `` only that he 's too familiar . ''"
"`` Well , now , and the short and long of it , captain ? ''"
asked the doctor .
`` Tell us what you want . ''
"`` Well , gentlemen , are you determined to go on this cruise ? ''"
"`` Like iron , '' answered the squire ."
"`` Very good , '' said the captain ."
"`` Then , as you 've heard me very patiently , saying things that I could not prove , hear me a few words more ."
They are putting the powder and the arms in the fore hold .
"Now , you have a good place under the cabin ; why not put them there ?"
-- first point .
"Then , you are bringing four of your own people with you , and they tell me some of them are to be berthed forward ."
Why not give them the berths here beside the cabin ?
-- second point . ''
`` Any more ? ''
asked Mr. Trelawney .
"`` One more , '' said the captain ."
`` There 's been too much blabbing already . ''
"`` Far too much , '' agreed the doctor ."
"`` I 'll tell you what I 've heard myself , '' continued Captain Smollett : `` that you have a map of an island , that there 's crosses on the map to show where treasure is , and that the island lies -- '' And then he named the latitude and longitude exactly ."
"`` I never told that , '' cried the squire , `` to a soul ! ''"
"`` The hands know it , sir , '' returned the captain ."
"`` Livesey , that must have been you or Hawkins , '' cried the squire ."
"`` It does n't much matter who it was , '' replied the doctor ."
And I could see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney 's protestations .
"Neither did I , to be sure , he was so loose a talker ; yet in this case I believe he was really right and that nobody had told the situation of the island ."
"`` Well , gentlemen , '' continued the captain , `` I do n't know who has this map ; but I make it a point , it shall be kept secret even from me and Mr. Arrow ."
Otherwise I would ask you to let me resign . ''
"`` I see , '' said the doctor ."
"`` You wish us to keep this matter dark and to make a garrison of the stern part of the ship , manned with my friend 's own people , and provided with all the arms and powder on board ."
"In other words , you fear a mutiny . ''"
"`` Sir , '' said Captain Smollett , `` with no intention to take offence , I deny your right to put words into my mouth ."
"` Shall I after him , captain , ' asked pathetic Smee , ` and tickle him with Johnny Corkscrew ? '"
"Smee had pleasant names for everything , and his cutlass was Johnny Corkscrew , because he wriggled it in the wound ."
One could mention many lovable traits in Smee .
"For instance , after killing , it was his spectacles he wiped instead of his weapon ."
"` Johnny 's a silent fellow , ' he reminded Hook ."
"` Not now , Smee , ' Hook said darkly ."
"` He is only one , and I want to mischief all the seven ."
Scatter and look for them . '
"The pirates disappeared among the trees , and in a moment their captain and Smee were alone ."
"Hook heaved a heavy sigh ; and I know not why it was , perhaps it was because of the soft beauty of the evening , but there came over him a desire to confide to his faithful bo ` sun the story of his life ."
"He spoke long and earnestly , but what it was all about Smee , who was rather stupid , did not know in the least ."
Anon he caught the word Peter .
"` Most of all , ' Hook was saying passionately , ' I want their captain , Peter Pan ."
'T was he cut off my arm . '
He brandished the hook threateningly .
` I 've waited long to shake his hand with this .
"Oh , I 'll tear him . '"
"` And yet , ' said Smee , ' I have often heard you say that hook was worth a score of hands , for combing the hair and other homely uses . '"
"` Ay , ' the captain answered , ` if I was a mother I would pray to have my children born with this instead of that , ' and he cast a look of pride upon his iron hand and one of scorn upon the other ."
Then again he frowned .
"` Peter flung my arm , ' he said , wincing , ` to a crocodile that happened to be passing by . ' '"
"I have often , ' said Smee , ` noticed your strange dread of crocodiles . '"
"` Not of crocodiles , ' Hook corrected him , ` but of that one crocodile . '"
He lowered his voice .
"` It liked my arm so much , Smee , that it has followed me ever since , from sea to sea and from land to land , licking its lips for the rest of me . '"
"` In a way , ' said Smee , ` it 's a sort of compliment . ' '"
"I want no such compliments , ' Hook barked petulantly . '"
"I want Peter Pan , who first gave the brute its taste for me . '"
"He sat down on a large mushroom , and now there was a quiver in his voice ."
"` Smee , ' he said huskily , ` that crocodile would have had me before this , but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which goes tick tick inside it , and so before it can reach me I hear the tick and bolt . '"
"He laughed , but in a hollow way ."
"` Some day , ' said Smee , ` the clock will run down , and then he 'll get you . '"
"When he had gone home Anne soothed and warmed the sobbing , shivering Dora , got her her supper and put her to bed ."
"Then she returned to the kitchen , just as Marilla came grimly in , leading , or rather pulling , the reluctant , cobwebby Davy , whom she had just found hidden away in the darkest corner of the stable ."
She jerked him to the mat on the middle of the floor and then went and sat down by the east window .
Anne was sitting limply by the west window .
Between them stood the culprit .
"His back was toward Marilla and it was a meek , subdued , frightened back ; but his face was toward Anne and although it was a little shamefaced there was a gleam of comradeship in Davy 's eyes , as if he knew he had done wrong and was going to be punished for it , but could count on a laugh over it all with Anne later on ."
"But no half hidden smile answered him in Anne 's gray eyes , as there might have done had it been only a question of mischief ."
There was something else ... something ugly and repulsive .
"`` How could you behave so , Davy ? ''"
she asked sorrowfully .
Davy squirmed uncomfortably .
`` I just did it for fun .
Things have been so awful quiet here for so long that I thought it would be fun to give you folks a big scare .
"It was , too . ''"
In spite of fear and a little remorse Davy grinned over the recollection .
"`` But you told a falsehood about it , Davy , '' said Anne , more sorrowfully than ever ."
Davy looked puzzled .
`` What 's a falsehood ?
Do you mean a whopper ? ''
`` I mean a story that was not true . ''
"`` Course I did , '' said Davy frankly ."
`` If I had n't you would n't have been scared .
I HAD to tell it . ''
Anne was feeling the reaction from her fright and exertions .
Davy 's impenitent attitude gave the finishing touch .
Two big tears brimmed up in her eyes .
"`` Oh , Davy , how could you ? ''"
"she said , with a quiver in her voice ."
`` Do n't you know how wrong it was ? ''
Davy was aghast .
Anne crying ... he had made Anne cry !
A flood of real remorse rolled like a wave over his warm little heart and engulfed it .
"So when the man woke , there was a poke beside him and something into the inside of it that moved ."
"Well , it seems he was one of these gentry that think aye the worst of things ; and for greater security , he stuck his dirk throughout that poke before he opened it , and there was his bairn dead ."
"I am thinking to myself , Mr. Balfour , that you and the man are very much alike . ''"
* Bag .
`` Do you mean you had no hand in it ? ''
"cried I , sitting up ."
"`` I will tell you first of all , Mr. Balfour of Shaws , as one friend to another , '' said Alan , `` that if I were going to kill a gentleman , it would not be in my own country , to bring trouble on my clan ; and I would not go wanting sword and gun , and with a long fishing-rod upon my back . ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` that 's true ! ''"
"`` And now , '' continued Alan , taking out his dirk and laying his hand upon it in a certain manner , `` I swear upon the Holy Iron I had neither art nor part , act nor thought in it . ''"
`` I thank God for that ! ''
"cried I , and offered him my hand ."
He did not appear to see it .
`` And here is a great deal of work about a Campbell ! ''
said he .
"`` They are not so scarce , that I ken ! ''"
"`` At least , '' said I , `` you can not justly blame me , for you know very well what you told me in the brig. But the temptation and the act are different , I thank God again for that ."
"We may all be tempted ; but to take a life in cold blood , Alan ! ''"
And I could say no more for the moment .
`` And do you know who did it ? ''
I added .
`` Do you know that man in the black coat ? ''
"`` I have nae clear mind about his coat , '' said Alan cunningly , `` but it sticks in my head that it was blue . ''"
"`` Blue or black , did ye know him ? ''"
"said I. `` I couldnae just conscientiously swear to him , '' says Alan ."
"`` He gaed very close by me , to be sure , but it 's a strange thing that I should just have been tying my brogues . ''"
"`` Can you swear that you do n't know him , Alan ? ''"
"I cried , half angered , half in a mind to laugh at his evasions ."
"`` Not yet , '' says he ; `` but I 've a grand memory for forgetting , David . ''"
"`` And yet there was one thing I saw clearly , '' said I ; `` and that was , that you exposed yourself and me to draw the soldiers . ''"
"`` It 's very likely , '' said Alan ; `` and so would any gentleman ."
You and me were innocent of that transaction . ''
"`` The better reason , since we were falsely suspected , that we should get clear , '' I cried ."
`` One ! ''
-LRB- Slightly had begun to count . -RRB-
"None too soon , Peter , every inch of him on tiptoe , vanished into the cabin ; for more than one pirate was screwing up his courage to look round ."
"They could hear each other 's distressed breathing now , which showed them that the more terrible sound had passed ."
"`` It 's gone , captain , '' Smee said , wiping off his spectacles ."
`` All 's still again . ''
"Slowly Hook let his head emerge from his ruff , and listened so intently that he could have caught the echo of the tick ."
"There was not a sound , and he drew himself up firmly to his full height ."
`` Then here 's to Johnny Plank ! ''
"he cried brazenly , hating the boys more than ever because they had seen him unbend ."
"He broke into the villainous ditty : `` Yo ho , yo ho , the frisky plank , You walks along it so , Till it goes down and you goes down To Davy Jones below ! ''"
"To terrorize the prisoners the more , though with a certain loss of dignity , he danced along an imaginary plank , grimacing at them as he sang ; and when he finished he cried , `` Do you want a touch of the cat -LSB- o ' nine tails -RSB- before you walk the plank ? ''"
At that they fell on their knees .
"`` No , no ! ''"
they cried so piteously that every pirate smiled .
"`` Fetch the cat , Jukes , '' said Hook ; `` it 's in the cabin . ''"
The cabin !
Peter was in the cabin !
The children gazed at each other .
"`` Ay , ay , '' said Jukes blithely , and he strode into the cabin ."
"They followed him with their eyes ; they scarce knew that Hook had resumed his song , his dogs joining in with him : `` Yo ho , yo ho , the scratching cat , Its tails are nine , you know , And when they 're writ upon your back -- '' What was the last line will never be known , for of a sudden the song was stayed by a dreadful screech from the cabin ."
"It wailed through the ship , and died away ."
"Then was heard a crowing sound which was well understood by the boys , but to the pirates was almost more eerie than the screech ."
`` What was that ? ''
cried Hook .
"`` Two , '' said Slightly solemnly ."
The Italian Cecco hesitated for a moment and then swung into the cabin .
"He tottered out , haggard ."
"`` What 's the matter with Bill Jukes , you dog ? ''"
"hissed Hook , towering over him ."
"`` The matter wi ' him is he 's dead , stabbed , '' replied Cecco in a hollow voice ."
`` Bill Jukes dead ! ''
"` What fun , ' he said doubtfully , and they did not dare expose him when Mrs. Darling and Nana returned ."
"` Nana , good dog , ' he said , patting her , ' I have put a little milk into your bowl , Nana . '"
"Nana wagged her tail , ran to the medicine , and began lapping it ."
"Then she gave Mr. Darling such a look , not an angry look : she showed him the great red tear that makes us so sorry for noble dogs , and crept into her kennel ."
"Mr. Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself , but he would not give in ."
In a horrid silence Mrs. Darling smelt the bowl . '
"O George , ' she said , ` it 's your medicine ! '"
"` It was only a joke , ' he roared , while she comforted her boys , and Wendy hugged Nana ."
"` Much good , ' he said bitterly , ` my wearing myself to the bone trying to be funny in this house . '"
And still Wendy hugged Nana .
"` That 's right , ' he shouted ."
` Coddle her !
Nobody coddles me .
Oh dear no !
"I am only the breadwinner , why should I be coddled , why , why , why ! '"
"` George , ' Mrs. Darling entreated him , ` not so loud ; the servants will hear you . '"
Somehow they had got into the way of calling Liza the servants .
"` Let them , ' he answered recklessly ."
` Bring in the whole world .
But I refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour longer . '
"The children wept , and Nana ran to him beseechingly , but he waved her back ."
He felt he was a strong man again .
"` In vain , in vain , ' he cried ; ` the proper place for you is the yard , and there you go to be tied up this instant . '"
"` George , George , ' Mrs. Darling whispered , ` remember what I told you about that boy . '"
"Alas , he would not listen ."
"He was determined to show who was master in that house , and when commands would not draw Nana from the kennel , he lured her out of it with honeyed words , and seizing her roughly , dragged her from the nursery ."
"He was ashamed of himself , and yet he did it ."
"It was all owing to his too affectionate nature , which craved for admiration ."
"When he had tied her up in the back-yard , the wretched father went and sat in the passage , with his knuckles to his eyes ."
In the meantime Mrs. Darling had put the children to bed in unwonted silence and lit their night-lights .
"They could hear Nana barking , and John whimpered , ` It is because he is chaining her up in the yard , ' but Wendy was wiser ."
"` That is not Nana 's unhappy bark , ' she said , little guessing what was about to happen ; ` that is her bark when she smells danger . '"
"Here Michael , encouraged by his success , breathed so loudly that they were nearly detected ."
"Nana knew that kind of breathing , and she tried to drag herself out of Liza 's clutches ."
But Liza was dense .
"` No more of it , Nana , ' she said sternly , pulling her out of the room . '"
"I warn you if you bark again I shall go straight for master and missus and bring them home from the party , and then , oh , wo n't master whip you , just . '"
"She tied the unhappy dog up again , but do you think Nana ceased to bark ?"
Bring master and missus home from the party !
"Why , that was just what she wanted ."
Do you think she cared whether she was whipped so long as her charges were safe ?
"Unfortunately Liza returned to her puddings , and Nana , seeing that no help would come from her , strained and strained at the chain until at last she broke it ."
"In another moment she had burst into the dining-room of 27 and flung up her paws to heaven , her most expressive way of making a communication ."
"Mr. and Mrs. Darling knew at once that something terrible was happening in their nursery , and without a good-bye to their hostess they rushed into the street ."
But it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing behind the curtains ; and Peter Pan can do a great deal in ten minutes .
We now return to the nursery .
"` It 's all right , ' John announced , emerging from his hiding-place . '"
"I say , Peter , can you really fly ? '"
"Instead of troubling to answer him Peter flew round the room , taking the mantelpiece on the way ."
` How topping ! '
said John and Michael .
` How sweet ! '
cried Wendy .
"` Yes , I 'm sweet , oh , I am sweet ! '"
"said Peter , forgetting his manners again ."
"It looked delightfully easy , and they tried it first from the floor and then from the beds , but they always went down instead of up . '"
"I say , how do you do it ? '"
"asked John , rubbing his knee ."
He was quite a practical boy .
"` You just think lovely wonderful thoughts , ' Peter explained , ` and they lift you up in the air . '"
He showed them again .
"` You 're so nippy at it , ' John said ; ` could n't you do it very slowly once ? '"
Peter did it both slowly and quickly .
"` I 've got it now , Wendy ! '"
"And how long is it before Marilla expects to be stone blind , Anne ? ''"
"`` The doctor thinks her eyes will not get any worse if she is very careful , '' faltered Anne ."
Eliza shook her head .
`` Doctors always talk like that just to keep people cheered up .
I would n't have much hope if I was her .
It 's best to be prepared for the worst . ''
`` But ought n't we be prepared for the best too ? ''
pleaded Anne .
`` It 's just as likely to happen as the worst . ''
"`` Not in my experience , and I 've fifty-seven years to set against your sixteen , '' retorted Eliza ."
"`` Going , are you ?"
"Well , I hope this new society of yours will be able to keep Avonlea from running any further down hill but I have n't much hope of it . ''"
"Anne and Diana got themselves thankfully out , and drove away as fast as the fat pony could go ."
"As they rounded the curve below the beech wood a plump figure came speeding over Mr. Andrews ' pasture , waving to them excitedly ."
"It was Catherine Andrews and she was so out of breath that she could hardly speak , but she thrust a couple of quarters into Anne 's hand ."
"`` That 's my contribution to painting the hall , '' she gasped ."
`` I 'd like to give you a dollar but I do n't dare take more from my egg money for Eliza would find it out if I did .
I 'm real interested in your society and I believe you 're going to do a lot of good .
I 'm an optimist .
"I HAVE to be , living with Eliza ."
I must hurry back before she misses me ... she thinks I 'm feeding the hens .
"I hope you 'll have good luck canvassing , and do n't be cast down over what Eliza said ."
The world IS getting better ... it certainly is . ''
The next house was Daniel Blair 's .
"`` Now , it all depends on whether his wife is home or not , '' said Diana , as they jolted along a deep-rutted lane ."
`` If she is we wo n't get a cent .
"Everybody says Dan Blair does n't dare have his hair cut without asking her permission ; and it 's certain she 's very close , to state it moderately ."
She says she has to be just before she 's generous .
But Mrs. Lynde says she 's so much ` before ' that generosity never catches up with her at all . ''
Anne related their experience at the Blair place to Marilla that evening .
`` We tied the horse and then rapped at the kitchen door .
"Nobody came but the door was open and we could hear somebody in the pantry , going on dreadfully ."
"`` First ship that ever I lost , '' said Captain Smollett ."
"I was dead tired , as you may fancy ; and when I got to sleep , which was not till after a great deal of tossing , I slept like a log of wood ."
The rest had long been up and had already breakfasted and increased the pile of firewood by about half as much again when I was wakened by a bustle and the sound of voices .
`` Flag of truce ! ''
"I heard someone say ; and then , immediately after , with a cry of surprise , `` Silver himself ! ''"
"And at that , up I jumped , and rubbing my eyes , ran to a loophole in the wall ."
"20 Silver 's Embassy SURE enough , there were two men just outside the stockade , one of them waving a white cloth , the other , no less a person than Silver himself , standing placidly by ."
"It was still quite early , and the coldest morning that I think I ever was abroad in -- a chill that pierced into the marrow ."
"The sky was bright and cloudless overhead , and the tops of the trees shone rosily in the sun ."
"But where Silver stood with his lieutenant , all was still in shadow , and they waded knee-deep in a low white vapour that had crawled during the night out of the morass ."
The chill and the vapour taken together told a poor tale of the island .
"It was plainly a damp , feverish , unhealthy spot ."
"`` Keep indoors , men , '' said the captain ."
`` Ten to one this is a trick . ''
Then he hailed the buccaneer .
`` Who goes ?
"Stand , or we fire . ''"
"`` Flag of truce , '' cried Silver ."
"The captain was in the porch , keeping himself carefully out of the way of a treacherous shot , should any be intended ."
"He turned and spoke to us , `` Doctor 's watch on the lookout ."
"Dr. Livesey take the north side , if you please ; Jim , the east ; Gray , west ."
"The watch below , all hands to load muskets ."
"Lively , men , and careful . ''"
And then he turned again to the mutineers .
`` And what do you want with your flag of truce ? ''
he cried .
This time it was the other man who replied .
"`` Cap'n Silver , sir , to come on board and make terms , '' he shouted ."
`` Cap'n Silver !
Do n't know him .
Who 's he ? ''
cried the captain .
An hour passed away .
`` Hang them ! ''
said the captain .
`` This is as dull as the doldrums .
"Gray , whistle for a wind . ''"
And just at that moment came the first news of the attack .
"`` If you please , sir , '' said Joyce , `` if I see anyone , am I to fire ? ''"
`` I told you so ! ''
cried the captain .
"`` Thank you , sir , '' returned Joyce with the same quiet civility ."
"Nothing followed for a time , but the remark had set us all on the alert , straining ears and eyes -- the musketeers with their pieces balanced in their hands , the captain out in the middle of the block house with his mouth very tight and a frown on his face ."
"So some seconds passed , till suddenly Joyce whipped up his musket and fired ."
"The report had scarcely died away ere it was repeated and repeated from without in a scattering volley , shot behind shot , like a string of geese , from every side of the enclosure ."
"Several bullets struck the log-house , but not one entered ; and as the smoke cleared away and vanished , the stockade and the woods around it looked as quiet and empty as before ."
"Not a bough waved , not the gleam of a musket-barrel betrayed the presence of our foes ."
`` Did you hit your man ? ''
asked the captain .
"`` No , sir , '' replied Joyce ."
"`` I believe not , sir . ''"
"`` Next best thing to tell the truth , '' muttered Captain Smollett ."
"`` Load his gun , Hawkins ."
"How many should say there were on your side , doctor ? ''"
"`` I know precisely , '' said Dr. Livesey ."
`` Three shots were fired on this side .
I saw the three flashes -- two close together -- one farther to the west . ''
`` Three ! ''
repeated the captain .
"`` And how many on yours , Mr. Trelawney ? ''"
But this was not so easily answered .
"There had come many from the north -- seven by the squire 's computation , eight or nine according to Gray ."
From the east and west only a single shot had been fired .
"It was plain , therefore , that the attack would be developed from the north and that on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of hostilities ."
Then he looked sharply at his ward .
"`` Dick , '' said he , `` Y ' have seen this penny rhyme ? ''"
The lad replied in the affirmative .
"`` It bears your father 's name , '' continued the knight ; `` and our poor shrew of a parson is , by some mad soul , accused of slaying him . ''"
"`` He did most eagerly deny it , '' answered Dick ."
`` He did ? ''
"cried the knight , very sharply ."
`` Heed him not .
He has a loose tongue ; he babbles like a jack-sparrow .
"Some day , when I may find the leisure , Dick , I will myself more fully inform you of these matters ."
"There was one Duckworth shrewdly blamed for it ; but the times were troubled , and there was no justice to be got . ''"
`` It befell at the Moat House ? ''
"Dick ventured , with a beating at his heart ."
"`` It befell between the Moat House and Holywood , '' replied Sir Daniel , calmly ; but he shot a covert glance , black with suspicion , at Dick 's face ."
"`` And now , '' added the knight , `` speed you with your meal ; ye shall return to Tunstall with a line from me . ''"
Dick 's face fell sorely .
"`` Prithee , Sir Daniel , '' he cried , `` send one of the villains !"
I beseech you let me to the battle .
"I can strike a stroke , I promise you . ''"
"`` I misdoubt it not , '' replied Sir Daniel , sitting down to write ."
"`` But here , Dick , is no honour to be won ."
"I lie in Kettley till I have sure tidings of the war , and then ride to join me with the conqueror ."
"Cry not on cowardice ; it is but wisdom , Dick ; for this poor realm so tosseth with rebellion , and the king 's name and custody so changeth hands , that no man may be certain of the morrow ."
"Toss-pot and Shuttle-wit run in , but my Lord Good-Counsel sits o ' one side , waiting . ''"
"With that , Sir Daniel , turning his back to Dick , and quite at the farther end of the long table , began to write his letter , with his mouth on one side , for this business of the Black Arrow stuck sorely in his throat ."
"Meanwhile , young Shelton was going on heartily enough with his breakfast , when he felt a touch upon his arm , and a very soft voice whispering in his ear ."
"`` Make not a sign , I do beseech you , '' said the voice , `` but of your charity tell me the straight way to Holywood ."
"Beseech you , now , good boy , comfort a poor soul in peril and extreme distress , and set me so far forth upon the way to my repose . ''"
"`` Take the path by the windmill , '' answered Dick , in the same tone ; `` it will bring you to Till Ferry ; there inquire again . ''"
"And without turning his head , he fell again to eating ."
But with the tail of his eye he caught a glimpse of the young lad called Master John stealthily creeping from the room .
"`` Why , '' thought Dick , `` he is a young as I. ` Good boy ' doth he call me ?"
A pretty pass the world is coming to !
I 'll never consent to it . ''
"Perhaps if you had searched Greenwood and all the adjacent districts thoroughly you might have found a man who was more astonished and taken aback than old John Ellis was at that moment , but I doubt it ."
The wind was completely taken out of his sails and every bit of the Ellis contrariness was roused .
`` What have you got to say against my son ? ''
he fairly shouted in his rage .
"`` Is n't he good enough for your girl , Susan Oliver , I 'd like to know ? ''"
"`` No , he is n't , '' retorted Miss Susan deliberately and unflinchingly ."
"`` He 's well enough in his place , but you 'll please to remember , John Ellis , that my niece is an Oliver , and the Olivers do n't marry beneath them . ''"
Old John was furious .
`` Beneath them indeed !
"Why , woman , it is condescension in my son to so much as look at your niece -- condescension , that is what it is ."
You are as poor as church mice . ''
"`` We come of good family , though , '' retorted Miss Susan ."
`` You Ellises are nobodies .
Your grandfather was a hired man !
"And yet you have the presumption to think you 're fit to marry into an old , respectable family like the Olivers ."
But talking does n't signify .
I simply wo n't allow this nonsense to go on .
I came here today to tell you so plump and plain .
"It 's your duty to stop it ; if you do n't I will , that 's all . ''"
"`` Oh , will you ? ''"
John Ellis was at a white heat of rage and stubbornness now .
"`` We 'll see , Miss Susan , we 'll see ."
"My son shall marry whatever girl he pleases , and I 'll back him up in it -- do you hear that ?"
Come here and tell me my son is n't good enough for your niece indeed !
I 'll show you he can get her anyway . ''
"`` You 've heard what I 've said , '' was the answer , `` and you 'd better go by it , that 's all ."
"I sha n't stay to bandy words with you , John Ellis ."
"I 'm going home to talk to my niece and tell her her duty plain , and what I want her to do , and she 'll do it , I have n't a fear . ''"
"Miss Susan was halfway down the steps , but John Ellis ran to the railing of the verandah to get the last word ."
"`` I 'll send Burton down this evening to talk to her and tell her what he wants her to do , and we 'll see whether she 'll sooner listen to you than to him , '' he shouted ."
"`` Stand back , by ' r Lady ! ''"
"returned Dick , raising his bow ."
"`` Ah , y ' are a brave boy ! ''"
retorted Matcham .
`` Shoot ! ''
Dick lowered his weapon in some confusion .
"`` See here , '' he said ."
`` Y ' have done me ill enough .
"Go , then ."
"Go your way in fair wise ; or , whether I will or not , I must even drive you to it . ''"
"`` Well , '' said Matcham , doggedly , `` y ' are the stronger ."
Do your worst .
"I shall not leave to follow thee , Dick , unless thou makest me , '' he added ."
Dick was almost beside himself .
"It went against his heart to beat a creature so defenceless ; and , for the life of him , he knew no other way to rid himself of this unwelcome and , as he began to think , perhaps untrue companion ."
"`` Y ' are mad , I think , '' he cried ."
"`` Fool-fellow , I am hasting to your foes ; as fast as foot can carry me , go I thither . ''"
"`` I care not , Dick , '' replied the lad ."
"`` If y ' are bound to die , Dick , I 'll die too ."
I would liever go with you to prison than to go free without you . ''
"`` Well , '' returned the other , `` I may stand no longer prating ."
"Follow me , if ye must ; but if ye play me false , it shall but little advance you , mark ye that ."
"Shalt have a quarrel in thine inwards , boy . ''"
"So saying , Dick took once more to his heels , keeping in the margin of the thicket and looking briskly about him as he went ."
"At a good pace he rattled out of the dell , and came again into the more open quarters of the wood ."
"To the left a little eminence appeared , spotted with golden gorse , and crowned with a black tuft of firs ."
"`` I shall see from there , '' he thought , and struck for it across a heathy clearing ."
"He had gone but a few yards , when Matcham touched him on the arm , and pointed ."
"To the eastward of the summit there was a dip , and , as it were , a valley passing to the other side ; the heath was not yet out ; all the ground was rusty , like an unscoured buckler , and dotted sparingly with yews ; and there , one following another , Dick saw half a score green jerkins mounting the ascent , and marching at their head , conspicuous by his boar-spear , Ellis Duckworth in person ."
"One after another gained the top , showed for a moment against the sky , and then dipped upon the further side , until the last was gone ."
Dick looked at Matcham with a kindlier eye .
"`` So y ' are to be true to me , Jack ? ''"
"Sailors do n't always use the choicest language , and parrots are very imitative birds . ''"
"`` So I should think , '' said poor Anne , the remembrance of her errand quelling her resentment ."
"She could n't afford to snub Mr. Harrison under the circumstances , that was certain ."
"When you had just sold a man 's Jersey cow offhand , without his knowledge or consent you must not mind if his parrot repeated uncomplimentary things ."
"Nevertheless , the `` redheaded snippet '' was not quite so meek as she might otherwise have been ."
"`` I 've come to confess something to you , Mr. Harrison , '' she said resolutely ."
`` It 's ... it 's about ... that Jersey cow . ''
"`` Bless my soul , '' exclaimed Mr. Harrison nervously , `` has she gone and broken into my oats again ?"
"Well , never mind ... never mind if she has ."
"It 's no difference ... none at all , I ... I was too hasty yesterday , that 's a fact ."
Never mind if she has . ''
"`` Oh , if it were only that , '' sighed Anne ."
`` But it 's ten times worse .
"I do n't ... '' `` Bless my soul , do you mean to say she 's got into my wheat ? ''"
`` No ... no ... not the wheat .
But ... '' `` Then it 's the cabbages !
"She 's broken into my cabbages that I was raising for Exhibition , hey ? ''"
"`` It 's NOT the cabbages , Mr. Harrison ."
I 'll tell you everything ... that is what I came for -- but please do n't interrupt me .
It makes me so nervous .
"Just let me tell my story and do n't say anything till I get through -- and then no doubt you 'll say plenty , '' Anne concluded , but in thought only ."
"`` I wo n't say another word , '' said Mr. Harrison , and he did n't ."
"But Ginger was not bound by any contract of silence and kept ejaculating , `` Redheaded snippet '' at intervals until Anne felt quite wild ."
`` I shut my Jersey cow up in our pen yesterday .
This morning I went to Carmody and when I came back I saw a Jersey cow in your oats .
Diana and I chased her out and you ca n't imagine what a hard time we had .
I was so dreadfully wet and tired and vexed -- and Mr. Shearer came by that very minute and offered to buy the cow .
I sold her to him on the spot for twenty dollars .
It was wrong of me .
"I should have waited and consulted Marilla , of course ."
But I 'm dreadfully given to doing things without thinking -- everybody who knows me will tell you that .
Mr. Shearer took the cow right away to ship her on the afternoon train . ''
"He rushed to Anne , hurled himself into her lap , flung his arms around her neck , and burst into tears ."
"`` I did n't know it was wrong to tell whoppers , '' he sobbed ."
`` How did you expect me to know it was wrong ?
"All Mr. Sprott 's children told them REGULAR every day , and cross their hearts too ."
"I s ` pose Paul Irving never tells whoppers and here I 've been trying awful hard to be as good as him , but now I s ` pose you 'll never love me again ."
But I think you might have told me it was wrong .
"I 'm awful sorry I 've made you cry , Anne , and I 'll never tell a whopper again . ''"
Davy buried his face in Anne 's shoulder and cried stormily .
"Anne , in a sudden glad flash of understanding , held him tight and looked over his curly thatch at Marilla ."
"`` He did n't know it was wrong to tell falsehoods , Marilla ."
I think we must forgive him for that part of it this time if he will promise never to say what is n't true again . ''
"`` I never will , now that I know it 's bad , '' asseverated Davy between sobs ."
"`` If you ever catch me telling a whopper again you can ... '' Davy groped mentally for a suitable penance ... `` you can skin me alive , Anne . ''"
"`` Do n't say ` whopper , ' Davy ... say ` falsehood , ' '' said the schoolma'am ."
`` Why ? ''
"queried Davy , settling comfortably down and looking up with a tearstained , investigating face ."
`` Why ai n't whopper as good as falsehood ?
I want to know .
It 's just as big a word . ''
`` It 's slang ; and it 's wrong for little boys to use slang . ''
"`` There 's an awful lot of things it 's wrong to do , '' said Davy with a sigh ."
`` I never s ` posed there was so many .
"I 'm sorry it 's wrong to tell whop ... falsehoods , 'cause it 's awful handy , but since it is I 'm never going to tell any more ."
What are you going to do to me for telling them this time ?
I want to know . ''
Anne looked beseechingly at Marilla .
"`` I do n't want to be too hard on the child , '' said Marilla ."
"`` I daresay nobody ever did tell him it was wrong to tell lies , and those Sprott children were no fit companions for him ."
Poor Mary was too sick to train him properly and I presume you could n't expect a six-year-old child to know things like that by instinct .
I suppose we 'll just have to assume he does n't know ANYTHING right and begin at the beginning .
"But he 'll have to be punished for shutting Dora up , and I ca n't think of any way except to send him to bed without his supper and we 've done that so often ."
"Ca n't you suggest something else , Anne ?"
"`` It was a coward blow , '' returned Matcham ."
"`` Y ' are but a lout and bully , Master Dick ; ye but abuse advantages ; let there come a stronger , we will see you truckle at his boot !"
"Ye care not for vengeance , neither -- for your father 's death that goes unpaid , and his poor ghost that clamoureth for justice ."
"But if there come but a poor creature in your hands that lacketh skill and strength , and would befriend you , down she shall go ! ''"
Dick was too furious to observe that `` she . ''
`` Marry ! ''
"he cried , `` and here is news !"
Of any two the one will still be stronger .
"The better man throweth the worse , and the worse is well served ."
"Ye deserve a belting , Master Matcham , for your ill-guidance and unthankfulness to meward ; and what ye deserve ye shall have . ''"
"And Dick , who , even in his angriest temper , still preserved the appearance of composure , began to unbuckle his belt ."
"`` Here shall be your supper , '' he said , grimly ."
"Matcham had stopped his tears ; he was as white as a sheet , but he looked Dick steadily in the face , and never moved ."
"Dick took a step , swinging the belt ."
"Then he paused , embarrassed by the large eyes and the thin , weary face of his companion ."
His courage began to subside .
"`` Say ye were in the wrong , then , '' he said , lamely ."
"`` Nay , '' said Matcham , `` I was in the right ."
"Come , cruel !"
"I be lame ; I be weary ; I resist not ; I ne'er did thee hurt ; come , beat me -- coward ! ''"
"Dick raised the belt at this last provocation , but Matcham winced and drew himself together with so cruel an apprehension , that his heart failed him yet again ."
"The strap fell by his side , and he stood irresolute , feeling like a fool ."
"`` A plague upon thee , shrew ! ''"
he said .
"`` An ye be so feeble of hand , ye should keep the closer guard upon your tongue ."
But I 'll be hanged before I beat you ! ''
and he put on his belt again .
"`` Beat you I will not , '' he continued ; `` but forgive you ?"
-- never .
"I knew ye not ; ye were my master 's enemy ; I lent you my horse ; my dinner ye have eaten ; y ' ` ave called me a man o ' wood , a coward , and a bully ."
"Nay , by the mass !"
"the measure is filled , and runneth over ."
You were quite glad that the night-lights were in .
"You even liked Nana to say that this was just the mantelpiece over here , and that the Neverland was all make-believe ."
"Of course the Neverland had been make-believe in those days ; but it was real now , and there were no night-lights , and it was getting darker every moment , and where was Nana ?"
"They had been flying apart , but they huddled close to Peter now ."
"His careless manner had gone at last , his eyes were sparkling , and a tingle went through them every time they touched his body ."
"They were now over the fearsome island , flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their feet ."
"Nothing horrid was visible in the air , yet their progress had become slow and laboured , exactly as if they were pushing their way through hostile forces ."
Sometimes they hung in the air until Peter had beaten on it with his fists .
"` They do n't want us to land , ' he explained ."
` Who are they ? '
"Wendy whispered , shuddering ."
But he could not or would not say .
"Tinker Bell had been asleep on his shoulder , but now he wakened her and sent her on in front ."
"Sometimes he poised himself in the air , listening intently with his hand to his ear , and again he would stare down with eyes so bright that they seemed to bore two holes to earth ."
"Having done these things , he went on again ."
His courage was almost appalling .
"` Do you want an adventure now , ' he said casually to John , ` or would you like to have your tea first ? '"
"Wendy said ` tea first ' quickly , and Michael pressed her hand in gratitude , but the braver John hesitated ."
` What kind of adventure ? '
he asked cautiously .
"` There 's a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us , ' Peter told him ."
"` If you like , we 'll go down and kill him . ' '"
"I do n't see him , ' John said after a long pause . '"
I do . '
"` Suppose , ' John said a little huskily , ` he were to wake up . '"
Peter spoke indignantly .
` You do n't think I would kill him while he was sleeping !
"I would wake him first , and then kill him ."
That 's the way I always do . ' '
I say !
Do you kill many ? '
` Tons . '
`` Lazy ? ''
`` Certainly .
"Laziness is a virtue in these strenuous days , I was not born with it , but I have painstakingly acquired it , and I am proud of my success ."
I have time to enjoy life . ''
"`` I think that I like you , '' said Mollie ."
"`` You have the merit of being able to enter into a situation , '' he assured her ."
When the last Jersey was milked they carried the pails down to the spring where the creamers were sunk and strained the milk into them .
Murray washed the pails and Mollie wiped them and set them in a gleaming row on the shelf under a big maple .
"`` Thank you , '' she said ."
"`` You are not going yet , '' said Murray resolutely ."
`` The time I saved you in milking three cows belongs to me .
We will spend it in a walk along the pond shore .
I will show you a path I have discovered under the beeches .
It is just wide enough for two .
Come . ''
"He took her hand and drew her through the copse into a green lane , where the ferns grew thickly on either side and the pond waters plashed dreamily below them ."
"He kept her hand in his as they went down the path , and she did not try to withdraw it ."
"About them was the great , pure silence of the morning , faintly threaded with caressing sounds -- croon of birds , gurgle of waters , sough of wind ."
The spirit of youth and love hovered over them and they spoke no word .
"When they finally came out on a little green nook swimming in early sunshine and arched over by maples , with the wide shimmer of the pond before it and the gold dust of blossoms over the grass , the girl drew a long breath of delight ."
"`` It is a morning left over from Eden , is n't it ? ''"
said Murray .
"`` Yes , '' said Mollie softly ."
Murray bent toward her .
"`` You are Eve , '' he said ."
`` You are the only woman in the world -- for me .
Adam must have told Eve just what he thought about her the first time he saw her .
There were no conventionalities in Eden -- and people could not have taken long to make up their minds .
We are in Eden just now .
One can say what he thinks in Eden without being ridiculous .
"You are divinely fair , Eve ."
Your eyes are stars of the morning -- your cheek has the flush it stole from the sunrise-your lips are redder than the roses of paradise .
"` Yes , I shall only bring a fairy story for my dowry , ' said he , and so they parted ."
But the princess gave him a sabre set with gold pieces which he could use .
"Then he flew away , bought himself a new dressing-gown , and sat down in the wood and began to make up a story , for it had to be ready by Saturday , and that was no easy matter ."
When he had it ready it was Saturday .
"The sultan , the sultana , and the whole court were at tea with the princess ."
He was most graciously received .
` Will you tell us a story ? '
said the sultana ; ` one that is thoughtful and instructive ? '
"` But something that we can laugh at , ' said the sultan ."
"` Oh , certainly , ' he replied , and began : ` Now , listen attentively ."
"There was once a box of matches which lay between a tinder-box and an old iron pot , and they told the story of their youth . '"
`` We used to be on the green fir-boughs .
"Every morning and evening we had diamond-tea , which was the dew , and the whole day long we had sunshine , and the little birds used to tell us stories ."
"We were very rich , because the other trees only dressed in summer , but we had green dresses in summer and in winter ."
"Then the woodcutter came , and our family was split up ."
We have now the task of making light for the lowest people .
That is why we grand people are in the kitchen . '' '
"`` My fate was quite different , '' said the iron pot , near which the matches lay . '"
"`` Since I came into the world I have been many times scoured , and have cooked much ."
My only pleasure is to have a good chat with my companions when I am lying nice and clean in my place after dinner . '' '
"`` Now you are talking too fast , '' spluttered the fire . '"
"`` Yes , let us decide who is the grandest ! ''"
said the matches . '
"`` No , I do n't like talking about myself , '' said the pot . '"
`` Let us arrange an evening 's entertainment .
I will tell the story of my life . '
`` On the Baltic by the Danish shore - '' ` What a beautiful beginning ! ''
said all the plates .
`` That 's a story that will please us all . ''
` And the end was just as good as the beginning .
All the plates clattered for joy . '
"`` Now I will dance , '' said the tongs , and she danced ."
`` And then Susan gave up .
` We can not save him !
"Oh , if your father was here -- look at him , the poor little fellow !"
I know not what to do . '
`` I looked at Jims and I thought he was dying .
"Susan was holding him up in his crib to give him a better chance for breath , but it did n't seem as if he could breathe at all ."
"My little war-baby , with his dear ways and sweet roguish face , was choking to death before my very eyes , and I could n't help him ."
I threw down the hot poultice I had ready in despair .
Of what use was it ?
"Jims was dying , and it was my fault -- I had n't been careful enough !"
`` Just then -- at eleven o'clock at night -- the door bell rang .
Such a ring -- it pealed all over the house above the roar of the storm .
Susan could n't go -- she dared not lay Jims down -- so I rushed downstairs .
In the hall I paused just a minute -- I was suddenly overcome by an absurd dread .
I thought of a weird story Gertrude had told me once .
An aunt of hers was alone in a house one night with her sick husband .
She heard a knock at the door .
"And when she went and opened it there was nothing there -- nothing that could be seen , at least ."
"But when she opened the door a deadly cold wind blew in and seemed to sweep past her right up the stairs , although it was a calm , warm summer night outside ."
Immediately she heard a cry .
She ran upstairs -- and her husband was dead .
"And she always believed , so Gertrude said , that when she opened that door she let Death in ."
`` It was so ridiculous of me to feel so frightened .
"But I was distracted and worn out , and I simply felt for a moment that I dared not open the door -- that death was waiting outside ."
Then I remembered that I had no time to waste -- must not be so foolish -- I sprang forward and opened the door .
`` Certainly a cold wind did blow in and filled the hall with a whirl of snow .
"But there on the threshold stood a form of flesh and blood -- Mary Vance , coated from head to foot with snow -- and she brought Life , not Death , with her , though I did n't know that then ."
I just stared at her . '' '
"I have n't been turned out , ' grinned Mary , as she stepped in and shut the door . '"
I came up to Carter Flagg 's two days ago and I 've been stormed-stayed there ever since .
"But old Abbie Flagg got on my nerves at last , and tonight I just made up my mind to come up here ."
"I thought I could wade this far , but I can tell you it was as much as a bargain ."
Also that there were very few birds in winter .
"` Of course they might want your clothes , ' he had to admit rather falteringly ."
She was somewhat indignant at this .
"` They are always thinking of their nests , ' he said apologetically , ` and there are some bits of you ' -- he stroked the fur on her pelisse -- ` that would excite them very much . '"
"` They sha n't have my fur , ' she said sharply ."
"` No , ' he said , still fondling it , however , ` no ."
"O Maimie , ' he said rapturously , ` do you know why I love you ?"
It is because you are like a beautiful nest . '
Somehow this made her uneasy . '
"I think you are speaking more like a bird than a boy now , ' she said , holding back , and indeed he was even looking rather like a bird ."
"` After all , ' she said , ` you are only a Betwixt-and-Between . '"
"But it hurt him so much that she immediately added , ` It must be a delicious thing to be . '"
"` Come and be one , then , dear Maimie , ' he implored her , and they set off for the boat , for it was now very near Open-Gate time ."
"` And you are not a bit like a nest , ' he whispered to please her ."
"` But I think it is rather nice to be like one , ' she said in a woman 's contradictory way ."
"` And , Peter , dear , though I ca n't give them my fur , I would n't mind their building in it ."
Fancy a nest in my neck with little spotty eggs in it !
"O Peter , how perfectly lovely ! '"
"-LSB- Illustration : Building the house for Maimie -RSB- But as they drew near the Serpentine , she shivered a little , and said , ` Of course I shall go and see mother often , quite often ."
"It is not as if I was saying good-bye for ever to mother , it is not in the least like that . '"
"` Oh no , ' answered Peter , but in his heart he knew it was very like that , and he would have told her so had he not been in a quaking fear of losing her ."
"He was so fond of her , he felt he could not live without her ."
"` She will forget her mother in time , and be happy with me , ' he kept saying to himself , and he hurried her on , giving her thimbles by the way ."
"But even when she had seen the boat and exclaimed ecstatically over its loveliness , she still talked tremblingly about her mother ."
"` You know quite well , Peter , do n't you , ' she said , ` that I would n't come unless I knew for certain I could go back to mother whenever I want to ?"
"Peter , say it . '"
"He said it , but he could no longer look her in the face ."
"` If you are sure your mother will always want you , ' he added rather sourly ."
` The idea of mother 's not always wanting me ! '
"Maimie cried , and her face glistened ."
"` If she does n't bar you out , ' said Peter huskily ."
"` The door , ' replied Maimie , ` will always , always be open , and mother will always be waiting at it for me . '"
They go on with their recollections .
"` It was then that I rushed in like a tornado , was n't it ? '"
"Mr. Darling would say , scorning himself ; and indeed he had been like a tornado ."
Perhaps there was some excuse for him .
"He , too , had been dressing for the party , and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie ."
"It is an astounding thing to have to tell , but this man , though he knew about stocks and shares , had no real mastery of his tie ."
"Sometimes the thing yielded to him without a contest , but there were occasions when it would have been better for the house if he had swallowed his pride and used a made-up tie ."
This was such an occasion .
He came rushing into the nursery with the crumpled little brute of a tie in his hand .
"` Why , what is the matter , father dear ? '"
` Matter ! '
he yelled ; he really yelled .
"` This tie , it will not tie . '"
He became dangerously sarcastic .
` Not round my neck !
Round the bed-post !
"Oh yes , twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post , but round my neck , no !"
Oh dear no !
begs to be excused ! '
"He thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed , and he went on sternly , ' I warn you of this , mother , that unless this tie is round my neck we do n't go out to dinner to-night , and if I do n't go out to dinner to-night , I never go to the office again , and if I do n't go to the office again , you and I starve , and our children will be flung into the streets . '"
Even then Mrs. Darling was placid .
"` Let me try , dear , ' she said , and indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do ; and with her nice cool hands she tied his tie for him , while the children stood around to see their fate decided ."
"Some men would have resented her being able to do it so easily , but Mr. Darling was far too fine a nature for that ; he thanked her carelessly , at once forgot his rage , and in another moment was dancing round the room with Michael on his back ."
` How wildly we romped ! '
"says Mrs. Darling now , recalling it ."
` Our last romp ! '
Mr. Darling groaned . '
"O George , do you remember Michael suddenly said to me , `` How did you get to know me , mother ? '' ' '"
I remember ! '
"` They were rather sweet , do n't you think , George ? '"
"` And they were ours , ours , and now they are gone . '"
"The romp had ended with the appearance of Nana , and most unluckily Mr. Darling collided against her , covering his trousers with hairs ."
"said I. `` Your money too , '' says Alan , with a groan ."
`` Ye shouldnae have given it me .
I 'm daft when I get to the cartes . ''
`` Hoot-toot !
hoot-toot ! ''
said Cluny .
`` It was all daffing ; it 's all nonsense .
"Of course you 'll have your money back again , and the double of it , if ye 'll make so free with me ."
It would be a singular thing for me to keep it .
It 's not to be supposed that I would be any hindrance to gentlemen in your situation ; that would be a singular thing ! ''
"cries he , and began to pull gold out of his pocket with a mighty red face ."
"Alan said nothing , only looked on the ground ."
"`` Will you step to the door with me , sir ? ''"
"said I. Cluny said he would be very glad , and followed me readily enough , but he looked flustered and put out ."
"`` And now , sir , '' says I , `` I must first acknowledge your generosity . ''"
`` Nonsensical nonsense ! ''
cries Cluny .
`` Where 's the generosity ?
"This is just a most unfortunate affair ; but what would ye have me do -- boxed up in this bee-skep of a cage of mine -- but just set my friends to the cartes , when I can get them ?"
"And if they lose , of course , it 's not to be supposed -- '' And here he came to a pause ."
"`` Yes , '' said I , `` if they lose , you give them back their money ; and if they win , they carry away yours in their pouches !"
"I have said before that I grant your generosity ; but to me , sir , it 's a very painful thing to be placed in this position . ''"
"There was a little silence , in which Cluny seemed always as if he was about to speak , but said nothing ."
All the time he grew redder and redder in the face .
"`` I am a young man , '' said I , `` and I ask your advice ."
Advise me as you would your son .
"My friend fairly lost his money , after having fairly gained a far greater sum of yours ; can I accept it back again ?"
Would that be the right part for me to play ?
"Whatever I do , you can see for yourself it must be hard upon a man of any pride . ''"
"`` It 's rather hard on me , too , Mr. Balfour , '' said Cluny , `` and ye give me very much the look of a man that has entrapped poor people to their hurt ."
"I wouldnae have my friends come to any house of mine to accept affronts ; no , '' he cried , with a sudden heat of anger , `` nor yet to give them ! ''"
"`` And so you see , sir , '' said I , `` there is something to be said upon my side ; and this gambling is a very poor employ for gentlefolks ."
"`` Nothing more -- at least , nothing about you ."
The rest was about myself -- I did not mind it -- much .
But I was so sorry to think that I had done you harm .
It is not too late to undo it .
You must not come here any more .
Then they will forget . ''
`` Perhaps -- but I should not forget .
It 's a little too late for me .
"Lynde , you must not let this venomous letter come between us ."
"I love you , dear -- I 've loved you ever since I met you and I want you for my wife . ''"
"Alan had not intended to say that just then , but the words came to his lips in spite of himself ."
She looked so sad and appealing and weary that he wanted to have the right to comfort and protect her .
She turned her eyes full upon him with no hint of maidenly shyness or shrinking in them .
"Instead , they were full of a blank , incredulous horror that swallowed up every other feeling ."
There was no mistaking their expression and it struck an icy chill to Alan 's heart .
He had certainly not expected a too ready response on her part -- he knew that even if she cared for him he might find it a matter of time to win her avowal of it -- but he certainly had not expected to see such evident abject dismay as her blanched face betrayed .
She put up her hand as if warding a blow .
"`` Do n't -- do n't , '' she gasped ."
`` You must not say that -- you must never say it .
"Oh , I never dreamed of this ."
"If I had thought it possible you could -- love me , I would never have been friends with you ."
"Oh , I 've made a terrible mistake . ''"
"She wrung her hands piteously together , looking like a soul in torment ."
Alan could not bear to see her pain .
"`` Do n't feel such distress , '' he implored ."
"`` I suppose I 've spoken too abruptly -- but I 'll be so patient , dear , if you 'll only try to care for me a little ."
"Ca n't you , dear ? ''"
"`` I ca n't marry you , '' said Lynde desperately ."
She leaned against a slim white bole of a young birch behind her and looked at him wretchedly .
`` Wo n't you please go away and forget me ? ''
"`` I ca n't forget you , '' Alan said , smiling a little in spite of his suffering ."
`` You are the only woman I can ever love -- and I ca n't give you up unless I have to .
"`` That wo n't do with me , my man , '' interrupted the captain ."
"`` We know exactly what you meant to do , and we do n't care , for now , you see , you ca n't do it . ''"
And the captain looked at him calmly and proceeded to fill a pipe .
`` If Abe Gray -- '' Silver broke out .
`` Avast there ! ''
cried Mr. Smollett .
"`` Gray told me nothing , and I asked him nothing ; and what 's more , I would see you and him and this whole island blown clean out of the water into blazes first ."
"So there 's my mind for you , my man , on that . ''"
This little whiff of temper seemed to cool Silver down .
"He had been growing nettled before , but now he pulled himself together ."
"`` Like enough , '' said he ."
"`` I would set no limits to what gentlemen might consider shipshape , or might not , as the case were ."
"And seein ' as how you are about to take a pipe , cap'n , I 'll make so free as do likewise . ''"
"And he filled a pipe and lighted it ; and the two men sat silently smoking for quite a while , now looking each other in the face , now stopping their tobacco , now leaning forward to spit ."
It was as good as the play to see them .
"`` Now , '' resumed Silver , `` here it is ."
"You give us the chart to get the treasure by , and drop shooting poor seamen and stoving of their heads in while asleep ."
"You do that , and we 'll offer you a choice ."
"Either you come aboard along of us , once the treasure shipped , and then I 'll give you my affy-davy , upon my word of honour , to clap you somewhere safe ashore ."
"Or if that ai n't to your fancy , some of my hands being rough and having old scores on account of hazing , then you can stay here , you can ."
"We 'll divide stores with you , man for man ; and I 'll give my affy-davy , as before to speak the first ship I sight , and send 'em here to pick you up ."
"Now , you 'll own that 's talking ."
"Handsomer you could n't look to get , now you ."
"And I hope '' -- raising his voice -- `` that all hands in this here block house will overhaul my words , for what is spoke to one is spoke to all . ''"
Captain Smollett rose from his seat and knocked out the ashes of his pipe in the palm of his left hand .
`` Is that all ? ''
he asked .
"`` Every last word , by thunder ! ''"
answered John .
"`` Refuse that , and you 've seen the last of me but musket-balls . ''"
"`` Very good , '' said the captain ."
`` Now you 'll hear me .
All the Turks jumped so high that their slippers flew above their heads ; such a splendid glitter they had never seen before .
Now they could quite well understand that it was the god of the Turks himself who was to marry the princess .
"As soon as the young merchant came down again into the wood with his trunk he thought , ` Now I will just go into the town to see how the show has taken . '"
And it was quite natural that he should want to do this .
Oh !
what stories the people had to tell !
"Each one whom he asked had seen it differently , but they had all found it beautiful . '"
"I saw the Turkish god himself , ' said one ."
"` He had eyes like glittering stars , and a beard like foaming water . '"
"` He flew away in a cloak of fire , ' said another ."
"They were splendid things that he heard , and the next day was to be his wedding day ."
Then he went back into the wood to sit in his trunk ; but what had become of it ?
The trunk had been burnt .
"A spark of the fireworks had set it alight , and the trunk was in ashes ."
"He could no longer fly , and could never reach his bride ."
She stood the whole day long on the roof and waited ; perhaps she is waiting there still .
But he wandered through the world and told stories ; though they are not so merry as the one he told about the matches .
The Snow-man Translated from the German of Hans Andersen .
` How astonishingly cold it is !
My body is cracking all over ! '
said the Snow-man .
` The wind is really cutting one 's very life out !
And how that fiery thing up there glares ! '
"He meant the sun , which was just setting ."
"` It sha 'n' t make me blink , though , and I shall keep quite cool and collected . '"
"Instead of eyes he had two large three-cornered pieces of slate in his head ; his mouth consisted of an old rake , so that he had teeth as well ."
"He was born amidst the shouts and laughter of the boys , and greeted by the jingling bells and cracking whips of the sledges ."
"The sun went down , the full moon rose , large , round , clear and beautiful , in the dark blue sky ."
` There it is again on the other side ! '
"said the Snow-man , by which he meant the sun was appearing again . '"
I have become quite accustomed to its glaring .
"I hope it will hang there and shine , so that I may be able to see myself ."
Smee had listened with growing admiration .
"` It 's the wickedest , prettiest policy ever I heard of , ' he cried , and in their exultation they danced and sang : ` Avast , belay , when I appear , By fear they 're overtook ; Nought 's left upon your bones when you Have shaken claws with Cook . '"
"They began the verse , but they never finished it , for another sound broke in and stilled them ."
"It was at first such a tiny sound that a leaf might have fallen on it and smothered it , but as it came nearer it was more distinct ."
Tick tick tick tick .
"Hook stood shuddering , one foot in the air ."
"` The crocodile , ' he gasped , and bounded away , followed by his bo ` sun ."
It was indeed the crocodile .
"It had passed the redskins , who were now on the trail of the other pirates ."
It oozed on after Hook .
"Once more the boys emerged into the open ; but the dangers of the night were not yet over , for presently Nibs rushed breathless into their midst , pursued by a pack of wolves ."
The tongues of the pursuers were hanging out ; the baying of them was horrible .
"` Save me , save me ! '"
"cried Nibs , falling on the ground ."
"` But what can we do , what can we do ? '"
It was a high compliment to Peter that at that dire moment their thoughts turned to him .
` What would Peter do ? '
they cried simultaneously .
"Almost in the same breath they added , ` Peter would look at them through his legs . '"
"And then , ` Let us do what Peter would do . '"
"It is quite the most successful way of defying wolves , and as one boy they bent and looked through their legs ."
"The next moment is the long one ; but victory came quickly , for as the boys advanced upon them in this terrible attitude , the wolves dropped their tails and fled ."
"Now Nibs rose from the ground , and the others thought that his staring eyes still saw the wolves ."
But it was not wolves he saw . '
"I have seen a wonderfuller thing , ' he cried , as they gathered round him eagerly . '"
A great white bird .
It is flying this way . '
"` What kind of a bird , do you think ? ' '"
"I do n't know , ' Nibs said , awestruck , ` but it looks so weary , and as it flies it moans , `` Poor Wendy . '' '"
` Poor Wendy ? ' '
"I remember , ' said Slightly instantly , ` there are birds called Wendies . '"
"` See , it comes , ' cried Curly , pointing to Wendy in the heavens ."
"I had heard the word , and I knew it stood for a horrible kind of punishment common enough among the buccaneers , in which the offender is put ashore with a little powder and shot and left behind on some desolate and distant island ."
"`` Marooned three years agone , '' he continued , `` and lived on goats since then , and berries , and oysters ."
"Wherever a man is , says I , a man can do for himself ."
"But , mate , my heart is sore for Christian diet ."
"You might n't happen to have a piece of cheese about you , now ?"
No ?
"Well , many 's the long night I 've dreamed of cheese -- toasted , mostly -- and woke up again , and here I were . ''"
"`` If ever I can get aboard again , '' said I , `` you shall have cheese by the stone . ''"
"All this time he had been feeling the stuff of my jacket , smoothing my hands , looking at my boots , and generally , in the intervals of his speech , showing a childish pleasure in the presence of a fellow creature ."
But at my last words he perked up into a kind of startled slyness .
"`` If ever you can get aboard again , says you ? ''"
he repeated .
"`` Why , now , who 's to hinder you ? ''"
"`` Not you , I know , '' was my reply ."
"`` And right you was , '' he cried ."
"`` Now you -- what do you call yourself , mate ? ''"
"`` Jim , '' I told him ."
"`` Jim , Jim , '' says he , quite pleased apparently ."
"`` Well , now , Jim , I 've lived that rough as you 'd be ashamed to hear of ."
"Now , for instance , you would n't think I had had a pious mother -- to look at me ? ''"
he asked .
"`` Why , no , not in particular , '' I answered ."
"`` Ah , well , '' said he , `` but I had -- remarkable pious ."
"And I was a civil , pious boy , and could rattle off my catechism that fast , as you could n't tell one word from another ."
"And here 's what it come to , Jim , and it begun with chuck-farthen on the blessed grave-stones !"
"That 's what it begun with , but it went further 'n that ; and so my mother told me , and predicked the whole , she did , the pious woman !"
But it were Providence that put me here .
"I 've thought it all out in this here lonely island , and I 'm back on piety ."
"You do n't catch me tasting rum so much , but just a thimbleful for luck , of course , the first chance I have ."
"I 'm bound I 'll be good , and I see the way to ."
"And , Jim '' -- looking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisper -- `` I 'm rich . ''"
"I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude , and I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face , for he repeated the statement hotly : `` Rich !"
"It were no help to me , good boy ."
But yet I thank you . ''
"The night had now fallen , and under the trees they could no longer read each other 's face ."
"`` I will go some little way with you , '' said Dick ."
`` The night is dark .
"I would fain leave you on a path , at least ."
"My mind misgiveth me , y ' are likely to be lost . ''"
"Without any more words , he began to walk forward , and the other once more followed him ."
The blackness grew thicker and thicker .
"Only here and there , in open places , they saw the sky , dotted with small stars ."
"In the distance , the noise of the rout of the Lancastrian army still continued to be faintly audible ; but with every step they left it farther in the rear ."
At the end of half an hour of silent progress they came forth upon a broad patch of heathy open .
"It glimmered in the light of the stars , shaggy with fern and islanded with clumps of yew ."
And here they paused and looked upon each other .
`` Y ' are weary ? ''
Dick said .
"`` Nay , I am so weary , '' answered Matcham , `` that methinks I could lie down and die . ''"
"`` I hear the chiding of a river , '' returned Dick ."
"`` Let us go so far forth , for I am sore athirst . ''"
"The ground sloped down gently ; and , sure enough , in the bottom , they found a little murmuring river , running among willows ."
"Here they threw themselves down together by the brink ; and putting their mouths to the level of a starry pool , they drank their fill ."
"`` Dick , '' said Matcham , `` it may not be ."
I can no more . ''
"`` I saw a pit as we came down , '' said Dick ."
`` Let us lie down therein and sleep . ''
"`` Nay , but with all my heart ! ''"
cried Matcham .
"The pit was sandy and dry ; a shock of brambles hung upon one hedge , and made a partial shelter ; and there the two lads lay down , keeping close together for the sake of warmth , their quarrel all forgotten ."
"And soon sleep fell upon them like a cloud , and under the dew and stars they rested peacefully ."
"CHAPTER VII -- THE HOODED FACE They awoke in the grey of the morning ; the birds were not yet in full song , but twittered here and there among the woods ; the sun was not yet up , but the eastern sky was barred with solemn colours ."
"Half starved and over-weary as they were , they lay without moving , sunk in a delightful lassitude ."
"And as they thus lay , the clang of a bell fell suddenly upon their ears ."
And he pinched me again in the most confidential manner .
"`` Then , '' he continued , `` then you 'll up , and you 'll say this : Gunn is a good man -LRB- you 'll say -RRB- , and he puts a precious sight more confidence -- a precious sight , mind that -- in a gen ` leman born than in these gen ` leman of fortune , having been one hisself . ''"
"`` Well , '' I said , `` I do n't understand one word that you 've been saying ."
But that 's neither here nor there ; for how am I to get on board ? ''
"`` Ah , '' said he , `` that 's the hitch , for sure ."
"Well , there 's my boat , that I made with my two hands ."
I keep her under the white rock .
"If the worst come to the worst , we might try that after dark ."
Hi ! ''
he broke out .
`` What 's that ? ''
"For just then , although the sun had still an hour or two to run , all the echoes of the island awoke and bellowed to the thunder of a cannon ."
`` They have begun to fight ! ''
I cried .
`` Follow me . ''
"And I began to run towards the anchorage , my terrors all forgotten , while close at my side the marooned man in his goatskins trotted easily and lightly ."
"`` Left , left , '' says he ; `` keep to your left hand , mate Jim !"
Under the trees with you !
Theer 's where I killed my first goat .
They do n't come down here now ; they 're all mastheaded on them mountings for the fear of Benjamin Gunn .
Ah !
"And there 's the cetemery '' -- cemetery , he must have meant ."
`` You see the mounds ?
"I come here and prayed , nows and thens , when I thought maybe a Sunday would be about doo ."
"It were n't quite a chapel , but it seemed more solemn like ; and then , says you , Ben Gunn was short-handed -- no chapling , nor so much as a Bible and a flag , you says . ''"
"So he kept talking as I ran , neither expecting nor receiving any answer ."
The cannon-shot was followed after a considerable interval by a volley of small arms .
"Another pause , and then , not a quarter of a mile in front of me , I beheld the Union Jack flutter in the air above a wood ."
PART FOUR -- The Stockade 16 Narrative Continued by the Doctor : How the Ship Was Abandoned IT was about half past one -- three bells in the sea phrase -- that the two boats went ashore from the HISPANIOLA .
"The captain , the squire , and I were talking matters over in the cabin ."
"Had there been a breath of wind , we should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with us , slipped our cable , and away to sea ."
"But the wind was wanting ; and to complete our helplessness , down came Hunter with the news that Jim Hawkins had slipped into a boat and was gone ashore with the rest ."
"To put it with brutal frankness , there never was a cockier boy ."
But for the moment Wendy was shocked .
"` You conceit , ' she exclaimed , with frightful sarcasm ; ` of course I did nothing ! '"
"` You did a little , ' Peter said carelessly , and continued to dance . '"
A little ! '
she replied with hauteur ; ` if I am no use I can at least withdraw ' ; and she sprang in the most dignified way into bed and covered her face with the blankets .
"To induce her to look up he pretended to be going away , and when this failed he sat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with his foot ."
"` Wendy , ' he said , ` do n't withdraw ."
"I ca n't help crowing , Wendy , when I 'm pleased with myself . '"
"Still she would not look up , though she was listening eagerly ."
"` Wendy , ' he continued , in a voice that no woman has ever yet been able to resist , ` Wendy , one girl is more use than twenty boys . '"
"Now Wendy was every inch a woman , though there were not very many inches , and she peeped out of the bedclothes ."
"` Do you really think so , Peter ? '"
"` Yes , I do . ' '"
"I think it 's perfectly sweet of you , ' she declared , ` and I 'll get up again ' ; and she sat with him on the side of the bed ."
"She also said she would give him a kiss if he liked , but Peter did not know what she meant , and he held out his hand expectantly ."
` Surely you know what a kiss is ? '
"she asked , aghast . '"
"I shall know when you give it to me , ' he replied stiffly ; and not to hurt his feelings she gave him a thimble ."
"` Now , ' said he , ` shall I give you a kiss ? '"
"and she replied with a slight primness , ` If you please . '"
"She made herself rather cheap by inclining her face toward him , but he merely dropped an acorn button into her hand ; so she slowly returned her face to where it had been before , and said nicely that she would wear his kiss on the chain round her neck ."
"It was lucky that she did put it on that chain , for it was afterwards to save her life ."
"When people in our set are introduced , it is customary for them to ask each other 's age , and so Wendy , who always liked to do the correct thing , asked Peter how old he was ."
"It was not really a happy question to ask him ; it was like an examination paper that asks grammar , when what you want to be asked is Kings of England . '"
"I do n't know , ' he replied uneasily , ` but I am quite young . '"
"He really knew nothing about it ; he had merely suspicions , but he said at a venture , ` Wendy , I ran away the day I was born . '"
"Wendy was quite surprised , but interested ; and she indicated in the charming drawing-room manner , by a touch on her night-gown , that he could sit nearer her ."
"` It was because I heard father and mother , ' he explained in a low voice , ` talking about what I was to be when I became a man . '"
He was extraordinarily agitated now . '
"I do n't want ever to be a man , ' he said with passion . '"
I want always to be a little boy and to have fun .
Alan shook his head .
"`` No , that has nothing to do with it . ''"
`` And you wo n't come back ? ''
`` It is not a question of will .
I can not -- must not go . ''
"`` Lynde will break her heart then , '' said Emily in a tone of despair ."
`` I think not .
She is too strong and fine for that .
Help her all you can with sympathy but do n't torment her with any questions .
"You may tell her if you like that I advise her to confide the whole story to you , but if she can not do n't tease her to ."
Be very gentle with her . ''
`` You do n't need to tell me that .
I 'd rather die than hurt her .
I came here full of anger against you -- but I see now you are not to blame .
You are suffering too -- your face tells that .
"All the same , I wish you 'd never set foot in Four Winds ."
She was n't happy before but she was n't so miserable as she is now .
"Oh , I know Anthony is at the bottom of it all in some way but I wo n't ask you any more questions since you do n't feel free to answer them ."
But are you sure that nothing can be done to clear up the trouble ? ''
"`` Too sure , '' said Alan 's white lips ."
* * * * * The autumn dragged away .
Alan found out how much a man may suffer and yet go on living and working .
"As for that , his work was all that made life possible for him now and he flung himself into it with feverish energy , growing so thin and hollow-eyed over it that even Elder Trewin remonstrated and suggested a vacation -- a suggestion at which Alan merely smiled ."
A vacation which would take him away from Lynde 's neighbourhood -- the thought was not to be entertained .
"He never saw Lynde , for he never went to any part of the shore now ; yet he hungered constantly for the sight of her , the sound of her voice , the glance of her luminous eyes ."
"When he pictured her eating her heart out in the solitude of Four Winds , he clenched his hands in despair ."
"As for the possibility of Harmon 's return , Alan could never face it for a moment ."
"When it thrust its ugly presence into his thoughts , he put it away desperately ."
The man was dead -- or his fickle fancy had veered elsewhere .
Nothing else could explain his absence .
"But they could never know , and the uncertainty would forever stand between him and Lynde like a spectre ."
But he thought more of Lynde 's pain than his own .
"I must take the bridle off , ' said Peder ."
` It is not to be sold with the animal as is usually the case . '
"` I 'll give you a hundred dollars for the bridle , ' said the old man , taking out his purse ."
"` No , I ca n't sell it , ' replied Hans 's father ."
` Five hundred dollars ! '
` No . ' '
A thousand ! '
At this splendid offer Peder 's prudence gave way ; it was a shame to let so much money go .
So he agreed to accept it .
"But he could hardly hold the horse , it became so unmanageable ."
"So he gave the animal in charge to the old man , and went home with his two thousand dollars ."
"Kirsten , of course , was delighted at this new piece of good fortune , and insisted that the new house should be built and land bought ."
"This time Peder consented , and soon they had quite a fine farm ."
"Meanwhile the old man rode off on his new purchase , and when he came to a smithy he asked the smith to forge shoes for the horse ."
"The smith proposed that they should first have a drink together , and the horse was tied up by the spring whilst they went indoors ."
"The day was hot , and both men were thirsty , and , besides , they had much to say ; and so the hours slipped by and found them still talking ."
"Then the servant girl came out to fetch a pail of water , and , being a kind-hearted lass , she gave some to the horse to drink ."
What was her surprise when the animal said to her : ` Take off my bridle and you will save my life . ' '
"I dare not , ' said she ; ` your master will be so angry . '"
"` He can not hurt you , ' answered the horse , ` and you will save my life . '"
At that she took off the bridle ; but nearly fainted with astonishment when the horse turned into a dove and flew away just as the old man came out of the house .
Directly he saw what had happened he changed himself into a hawk and flew after the dove .
"Over the woods and fields they went , and at length they reached a king 's palace surrounded by beautiful gardens ."
The princess was walking with her attendants in the rose garden when the dove turned itself into a gold ring and fell at her feet .
"` Why , here is a ring ! '"
"she cried , ` where could it have come from ? '"
And picking it up she put it on her finger .
"As she did so the hill-man lost his power over Hans -- for of course you understand that it was he who had been the dog , the cow , the horse and the dove ."
"` Well , that is really strange , ' said the princess ."
` It fits me as though it had been made for me ! '
Just at that moment up came the king .
` Look at what I have found ! '
Your voice is like music and your eyes are like pansies when the dew is on them .
You are like a tall stately queen .
Your hair is like rippling gold .
"Anthony Pye says it is red , but you need n't pay any attention to Anthony . '' '"
I have only known you for a few months but I can not realize that there was ever a time when I did not know you ... when you had not come into my life to bless and hallow it .
I will always look back to this year as the most wonderful in my life because it brought you to me .
"Besides , it 's the year we moved to Avonlea from Newbridge ."
My love for you has made my life very rich and it has kept me from much of harm and evil .
"I owe this all to you , my sweetest teacher . '' '"
I shall never forget how sweet you looked the last time I saw you in that black dress with flowers in your hair .
"I shall see you like that for ever , even when we are both old and gray ."
"You will always be young and fair to me , dearest teacher ."
I am thinking of you all the time ... in the morning and at the noontide and at the twilight .
I love you when you laugh and when you sigh ... even when you look disdainful .
I never saw you look cross though Anthony Pye says you always look so but I do n't wonder you look cross at him for he deserves it .
I love you in every dress ... you seem more adorable in each new dress than the last . ''
"` Dearest teacher , good night ."
The sun has set and the stars are shining ... stars that are as bright and beautiful as your eyes .
"I kiss your hands and face , my sweet ."
May God watch over you and protect you from all harm . ''
"`` Your afecksionate pupil , '' ` Annetta Bell . ' ''"
`` This extraordinary letter puzzled me not a little .
I knew Annetta could n't have composed it any more than she could fly .
When I went to school the next day I took her for a walk down to the brook at recess and asked her to tell me the truth about the letter .
Annetta cried and ` fessed up freely .
"She said she had never written a letter and she did n't know how to , or what to say , but there was bundle of love letters in her mother 's top bureau drawer which had been written to her by an old ` beau . ' ''"
"` It was n't father , ' sobbed Annetta , ` it was someone who was studying for a minister , and so he could write lovely letters , but ma did n't marry him after all ."
She said she could n't make out what he was driving at half the time .
But I thought the letters were sweet and that I 'd just copy things out of them here and there to write you .
I put `` teacher '' where he put `` lady '' and I put in something of my own when I could think of it and I changed some words .
I put `` dress '' in place of `` mood . ''
I did n't know just what a `` mood '' was but I s ` posed it was something to wear .
"In the pool of Corri-Bui swims a salmon with a skin that shines like silver , and whose gills are red -- bring them all to me , and then you shall know where dwell your brothers and your sister ! '"
` To-morrow at cock-crow I will begone ! '
answered Covan .
"The way to the mountain lay straight before him , and when he had climbed high he caught sight of the roe with the white feet and the spotted sides , on the peak in front ."
"Full of hope he set out in pursuit of her , but by the time he had reached that peak she had left it and was to be seen on another ."
"And so it always happened , and Covan 's courage had well-nigh failed him , when the thought of the Dog of Maol-mor darted into his mind ."
"` Oh , that he was here ! '"
he cried .
And looking up he saw him .
` Why did you summon me ? '
asked the Dog of Maol-mor .
"And when Covan had told him of his trouble , and how the roe always led him further and further , the Dog only answered : ` Fear nothing ; I will soon catch her for you . '"
And in a short while he laid the roe unhurt at Covan 's feet .
` What will you wish me to do with her ? '
said the Dog .
"And Covan answered : ` The old man bade me bring her , and the duck with the golden neck , and the salmon with the silver sides , to his cottage ; if I shall catch them , I know not ."
"But carry you the roe to the back of the cottage , and tether her so that she can not escape . '"
"` It shall be done , ' said the Dog of Maol-mor ."
"Then Covan sped to the lake which led to the land of the Sun , where the duck with the green body and the golden neck was swimming among the water-lilies ."
"` Surely I can catch him , good swimmer as I am , ' to himself ."
"But , if he could swim well , the duck could swim better , and at length his strength failed him , and he was forced to seek the land ."
` Oh that the black raven were here to help me ! '
he thought to himself .
And in a moment the black raven was perched on his shoulder .
` How can I help you ? '
asked the raven .
And Covan answered : ` Catch me the green duck that floats on the water . '
"And the raven flew with his strong wings and picked him up in his strong beak , and in another moment the bird was laid at the feet of Covan ."
"This time it was easy for the young man to carry his prize , and after giving thanks to the raven for his aid , he went on to the river ."
In the deep dark pool of which the old man had spoken the silver-sided salmon was lying under a rock .
"` Surely I , good fisher as I am , can catch him , ' said Covan son of Gorla ."
"And cutting a slender pole from a bush , he fastened a line to the end of it ."
I have lost my favourite ring ; DO stop for a moment and look if you can see it . '
But Jose answered : ` You will find plenty of rings where you are going . '
And the horse galloped on .
"At last they entered the palace gates , and the king 's heart bounded with joy at beholding his beloved Princess Bella-Flor ."
"But the princess brushed him aside as if he had been a fly , and locked herself into the nearest room , which she would not open for all his entreaties ."
"` Bring me the three things I lost on the way , and perhaps I may think about it , ' was all she would say ."
"And , in despair , the king was driven to take counsel of Jose ."
"` There is no remedy that I can see , ' said his majesty , ` but that you , who know where they are , should go and bring them back ."
And if you return without them I will have you drowned . '
Poor Jose was much troubled at these words .
"He thought that he had done all that was required of him , and that his life was safe ."
"However , he bowed low , and went out to consult his friend the horse ."
"` Do not vex yourself , ' said the horse , when he had heard the story ; ` jump up , and we will go and look for the things . '"
And Jose mounted at once .
"They rode on till they came to the ant-hill , and then the horse asked : ` Would you like to have the bran ? '"
` What is the use of liking ? '
answered Jose .
"` Well , call the ants , and tell them to fetch it for you ; and , if some of it has been scattered by the wind , to bring in its stead the grains that were in the cakes you gave them . '"
Jose listened in surprise .
"He did not much believe in the horse 's plan ; but he could not think of anything better , so he called to the ants , and bade them collect the bran as fast as they could ."
"Then he saw under a tree and waited , while his horse cropped the green turf ."
` Look there ! '
"said the animal , suddenly raising its head ; and Jose looked behind him and saw a little mountain of bran , which he put into a bag that was hung over his saddle ."
"` Good deeds bear fruit sooner or later , ' observed the horse ; ` but mount again , as we have far to go . '"
"When they arrived at the tree , they saw the handkerchief fluttering like a flag from the topmost branch , and Jose 's spirits sank again ."
` How am I to get that handkerchief ? '
cried he ; ` why I should need Jacob 's ladder ! '
"But the horse answered : ` Do not be frightened ; call to the eagle you set free from the net , he will bring it to you . '"
"So Jose called to the eagle , and the eagle flew to the top of the tree and brought back the handkerchief in its beak ."
"Jose thanked him , and vaulting on his horse they rode on to the river ."
"A great deal of rain had fallen in the night , and the river , instead of being clear as it was before , was dark and troubled ."
"` How am I to fetch the ring from the bottom of this river when I do not know exactly where it was dropped , and can not even see it ? '"
"Turning their backs with snippy glee, that Pig said, ""Not I,"""
"and that Cat said, ""Not I,"" and that Rat said, ""Not I."""
"So the good Little Red Hen could do nothing but say, ""I will then."""
And she did.
"Carrying the sack of Wheat, she trudged off to the distant mill. There she ordered the Wheat ground into beautiful white flour. When the miller brought her the flour she walked slowly back all the way to her own barnyard in her own picketty-pecketty fashion."
"She even managed, in spite of her load, to catch a nice juicy worm now and then and had one left for the babies when she reached them. Those cunning little fluff-balls were so glad to see their mother. For the first time, they really appreciated her.After this really strenuous day Mrs. Hen retired to her slumbers earlier than usual indeed, before the colors came into the sky to herald the setting of the sun, her usual bedtime hour."
"She would have liked to sleep late in the morning, but her chicks, joining in the morning chorus of the hen yard, drove away all hopes of such a luxury."
"Even as she sleepily half opened one eye, the thought came to her that to-day that Wheat must, somehow, be made into bread."
"She was not in the habit of making bread, although, of course, anyone can make it if he or she follows the recipe with care, and she knew perfectly well that she could do it if necessary."
"So after her children were fed and made sweet and fresh for the day, she hunted up the Pig, the Cat and the Rat."
"Still confident that they would surely help her some day she sang out, ""Who will make the bread?"""
"Alas for the Little Red Hen! Once more her hopes were dashed! For the Pig said, ""Not I,""the Cat said, ""Not I,"" and the Rat said, ""Not I."""
"So the Little Red Hen said once more, ""I will then,"" and she did."
"Feeling that she might have known all the time that she would have to do it all herself, she went and put on a fresh apron and spotless cook's cap. First of all she set the dough, as was proper. When it was time she brought out the moulding board and the baking tins, moulded the bread, divided it into loaves, and put them into the oven to bake."
"All the while the Cat sat lazily by, giggling and chuckling.And close at hand the vain Rat powdered his nose and admired himself in a mirror."
In the distance could be heard the long-drawn snores of the dozing Pig.
At last the great moment arrived. A delicious odor was wafted upon the autumn breeze. Everywhere the barnyard citizens sniffed the air with delight.
The Red Hen ambled in her picketty-pecketty way toward the source of all this excitement.
"Although she appeared to be perfectly calm, in reality she could only with difficulty restrain an impulse to dance and sing, for had she not done all the work on this wonderful bread?"
Small wonder that she was the most excited person in the barnyard!
"She did not know whether the bread would be fit to eat, but joy of joys! when the lovely brown loaves came out of the oven, they were done to perfection."
"Then, probably because she had acquired the habit, the Red Hen called:"
"""Who will eat the Bread?"""
"All the animals in the barnyard were watching hungrily and smacking their lips in anticipation, and the Pig said, ""I will,"" the Cat said, ""I will,"" the Rat said, ""I will."""
"But the Little Red Hen said,"
"""No, you won't. I will."""
And she did.
OLD TALES FROM THE NORTH
EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST OF THE MOON
"Once on a time there was a poor husbandman who had so many children that he hadn't much of either food or clothing to give them. Pretty children they all were, but the prettiest was the youngest daughter, who was so lovely there was no end to her loveliness."
"And the friends said to each other, ""Well, let us be thankful he is. We have been bothered enough by her coming to us for advice which she never followed."""
THE QUARRELSOME MOLE
"When the first hillock of fresh brown earth was thrown up in the edge of the Forest, the People who lived there said to each other. ""Can it be that we have a new neighbor?"""
"Perhaps the Rabbits, the Ground Hogs, and the Snakes cared the most, for they also made their homes in the ground; yet even the Orioles wanted to know all about it. None of them had ever been acquainted with a Mole."
"They had seen the ridges in the meadows beneath which the Moles had their runways, and they knew that when the Moles were making these long streets under ground, they had to cut an opening through the grass once in a while and throw the loose earth out. This new mound in the forest looked exactly like those in the meadow, so they decided there must be a Mole in the neighborhood."
"If that were so, somebody should call upon him and get acquainted; but how could they call? Mrs. Red Squirrel said: ""Why can't some of you people who are so clever at digging, burrow down and find him?"""
"""Yes indeed,"" twittered the birds; ""that is a good plan."""
"But Mr. Red Squirrel smiled at his wife and said: ""I am afraid, Bushy-tail (that was his pet name for her) that none of our friends here could overtake the Mole. You know he is a very fast runner. If they were following they could never catch him."""
"""Let them burrow down ahead of the place where he is working, then,"""
said she.
"""And the Mole would turn and go another way, not knowing it was a friend looking for him."""
"""Well, why not make an opening into one of his runways and go into it, hunting until he is found?"" said Mrs. Red Squirrel, who was like some other people in not wishing to give up her own ideas."
"""Yes,"" cried a mischievous young Woodpecker; ""let the Ground Hog go. You surely don't think him too fat?"""
"Now there was no denying that the Ground Hog was getting too stout to look well, and people thought he would be angry at this. Perhaps he was angry. The little Rabbits were sure of it. They said they knew by the expression of his tail. Still, you know, the Ground Hog came of a good family, and well-bred people do not say mean things even if they are annoyed. He combed the fur on his face with both paws, and answered with a polite bow: ""If I had the slender and graceful form of my charming friend, Mrs. Red Squirrel, I should be delighted to do as she suggests."""
"That was really a very clever thing for Mr. Ground Hog to say. It was much more agreeable than if he had grunted out, ""Much she knows about it! We burrowing people are all too large."" And now Mrs. Red Squirrel was pleased and happy although her plan was not used."
"That night Mrs. Ground Hog said to her husband: ""I didn't know you admired Mrs. Red Squirrel so much."" And he answered: ""Pooh! Admire her?"
"She is a very good-looking person for one of her family, and I want to be polite to her for her husband's sake. He and I have business together. But for my part I prefer more flesh. I could never have married a slender wife, and I am pleased to see, my dear, that you are stouter than you were."" And this also shows how clever a fellow Mr."
Ground Hog was.
"The very next night, as luck would have it, the Mole came out of his runway for a scamper on the grass. Mr. Ground Hog saw him and made his acquaintance. ""We are glad to have you come,"" said he. ""You will find it a pleasant neighborhood. People are very friendly."""
"""Well, I'm glad of that,"" answered the Mole. ""I don't see any sense in people being disagreeable, myself, but in the meadow which I have just left there were the worst neighbors in the world. I stood it just as long as I could, and then I moved."""
"""I am sorry to hear that,"" said the Ground Hog, gently. ""I had always supposed it a pleasant place to live in."" He began to wonder what kind of fellow the Mole was. He did not like to hear him say such unkind things before a new acquaintance. Sometimes unpleasant things have to be said, but it was not so now."
"""Umph!"" said the Mole. ""You have to live with people to know them. Of course, we Moles had no friends among the insects. We are always glad to meet them in the ground, but they do not seem so glad to meet us. That is easily understood when you remember what hungry people Moles are."
"Friendship is all very well, but when a fellow's stomach is empty, he can't let that stand in the way of a good dinner. There was no such reason why the Tree Frog or the Garter Snake should dislike me."""
"""Are you sure they did dislike you?"""
"""Certain of it. I remember how one night I wanted to talk with the Garter Snake, and asked him to come out of his hole for a visit in the moonlight. He wouldn't come."""
"""What did he say?"" asked the Ground Hog."
"""Not a word! And that was the worst of it. Think how provoking it was for me to stand there and call and call and not get any reply."""
"""Perhaps he was not at home,"" suggested the Ground Hog."
"""That's what he said when I spoke to him. Said he was spending the night down by the river. As though I'd be likely to believe that! I guess he saw that he couldn't fool me, though, for after I told him what I thought of him he wriggled away without saying a word."""
"""Still he is not so disagreeable as the Tree Frog,"" said the Mole, after a pause in which the Ground Hog had been trying not to laugh. The Ground Hog said afterward that it was the funniest sight imaginable to see the stout little Mole scampering back and forth in the moonlight, and stopping every few minutes to scold about the Meadow People. The twitching of his tiny tail and the jerky motions of his large, pink-palmed digging hands, showed how angry he grew in thinking of them, and his pink snout fairly quivered with rage."
"""I will tell you about the Tree Frog,"" said the Mole. ""He is one of these fellows who are always just so good-natured and polite. I can't endure them. I say it's putting on airs to act that way. I was telling him what I thought of the Garter Snake, and what should he do but draw himself up and say: 'Excuse me, but the Garter Snake is a particular friend of mine, and I do not care to hear him spoken of in that way.' I guess I taught him one good lesson, though. I told him he was just the kind of person I should expect the Garter Snake to like, and that I wished them much joy together, but that I didn't want anything to do with them."
"No, she mightn't."
"""Tell me the way, then,"" she said, ""and I'll search you out; that surely I may get leave to do."""
"""Yes,"" she might do that, he said; ""but there was no way to that place. It lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and thither she'd never find her way."""
"So next morning, when she woke up, both Prince and castle were gone, and then she lay on a little green patch, in the midst of the gloomy thick wood, and by her side lay the same bundle of rags she had brought with her from her old home."
"So when she had rubbed the sleep out of her eyes, and wept till she was tired, she set out on her way, and walked many, many days, till she came to a lofty crag. Under it sat an old hag, and played with a gold apple which she tossed about. Here the lassie asked if she knew the way to the Prince, who lived with his step-mother in the Castle, that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and who was to marry the Princess with a nose three ells long."
"""How did you come to know about him?"" asked the old hag; ""but maybe you are the lassie who ought to have had him?"""
"Yes, she was."
"""So, so; it's you, is it?"" said the old hag. ""Well, all I know about him is, that he lives in the castle that lies East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and thither you'll come, late or never; but still you may have the loan of my horse, and on him you can ride to my next neighbour. Maybe she'll be able to tell you; and when you get there, just give the horse a switch under the left ear, and beg him to be off home; and, stay, this gold apple you may take with you."""
"So she got upon the horse, and rode a long, long time, till she came to another crag, under which sat another old hag, with a gold carding-comb. Here the lassie asked if she knew the way to the castle that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and she answered, like the first old hag, that she knew nothing about it, except it was east of the sun and west of the moon."
"""And thither you'll come, late or never, but you shall have the loan of my horse to my next neighbour; maybe she'll tell you all about it; and when you get there, just switch the horse under the left ear, and beg him to be off home."""
"And this old hag gave her the golden carding-comb; it might be she'd find some use for it, she said. So the lassie got up on the horse, and rode a far, far way, and a weary time; and so at last she came to another great crag, under which sat another old hag, spinning with a golden spinning-wheel. Her, too, she asked if she knew the way to the Prince, and where the castle was that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon. So it was the same thing over again."
"""Maybe it's you who ought to have had the Prince?"" said the old hag."
"Yes, it was."
"But she, too, didn't know the way a bit better than the other two."
"""East of the sun and west of the moon it was,"" she knew that was all."
"""And thither you'll come, late or never; but I'll lend you my horse, and then I think you'd best ride to the East Wind and ask him; maybe he knows those parts, and can blow you thither. But when you get to him, you need only give the horse a switch under the left ear, and he'll trot home of himself."""
"And so, too, she gave her the gold spinning-wheel. ""Maybe you'll find a use for it,"" said the old hag."
"Then on she rode many many days, a weary time, before she got to the East Wind's house, but at last she did reach it, and then she asked the East Wind if he could tell her the way to the Prince who dwelt east of the sun and west of the moon. Yes, the East Wind had often heard tell of it, the Prince and the castle, but he couldn't tell the way, for he had never blown so far."
"""But, if you will, I'll go with you to my brother the West Wind, maybe he knows, for he's much stronger. So, if you will just get on my back, I'll carry you thither."""
"Yes, she got on his back, and I should just think they went briskly along."
"So when they got there, they went into the West Wind's house, and the East Wind said the lassie he had brought was the one who ought to have had the Prince who lived in the castle East of the Sun and West of the Moon; and so she had set out to seek him, and how he had come with her, and would be glad to know if the West Wind knew how to get to the castle."
"""Nay,"" said the West Wind, ""so far I've never blown; but if you will, I'll go with you to our brother the South Wind, for he's much stronger than either of us, and he has flapped his wings far and wide. Maybe he'll tell you. You can get on my back, and I'll carry you to him."""
"Yes! she got on his back, and so they travelled to the South Wind, and weren't so very long on the way, I should think."
"When they got there, the West Wind asked him if he could tell her the way to the castle that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon, for it was she who ought to have had the Prince who lived there."
"""You don't say so! That's she, is it?"" said the South Wind."
"""Well, I have blustered about in most places in my time, but so far have I never blown; but if you will, I'll take you to my brother the North Wind; he is the oldest and strongest of the whole lot of us, and if he don't know where it is, you'll never find any one in the world to tell you. You can get on my back, and I'll carry you thither."""
"Yes! she got on his back, and away he went from his house at a fine rate. And this time, too, she wasn't long on her way."
"So when they got to the North Wind's house, he was so wild and cross, cold puffs came from him a long way off."
"""BLAST YOU BOTH, WHAT DO YOU WANT?"" he roared out to them ever so far off, so that it struck them with an icy shiver."
"""Well,"" said the South Wind, ""you needn't be so foul-mouthed, for here I am, your brother, the South Wind, and here is the lassie who ought to have had the Prince who dwells in the castle that lies East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and now she wants to ask you if you ever were there, and can tell her the way, for she would be so glad to find him again."""
"When he said this, all the Workers smiled, and even the Queen-Mother had to turn away her head. The Drones looked as solemn as possible. It would not do for them to laugh at their brother. They did not want him to laugh at them when they made excuses for staying at home. They even pretended not to hear one of the Workers when she said that it was funny how some people couldn't use their wings if one of their feet hurt them."
"""Yes,"" said another Worker, ""and it is funny, too, how some people can get along very well on three legs when they have to, while others are too helpless to do anything unless they can use the whole six."""
"The Drones began to talk together. ""I think that the whole swarm should fly at the Kingbird and sting him and drive him away,"" said one. ""There is no sense in allowing him to perch outside our home and catch us as we pass in and out. I say that we should make war upon him!"" He looked very fierce as he spoke, buzzing and twitching his feelers at every step."
"""Exactly!"" cried another Drone. ""If I had a sting, I would lead the attack. As it is, I may be useful in guarding the comb. It is a great pity that Drones have no stings."" You would have thought, to hear him speak, that if he had been given a sting like those of the Workers, not all the Bees in the tree could keep him from fighting."
"While the Drones were talking about war, some of the Workers sent to their Queen for advice. ""Tell us,"" they said, ""how to drive away the Kingbird. Should we try to sting him? You know it kills a Bee to sting anybody, and we don't want to if we can help it, yet we will if you say so."""
"The Queen-Mother shook her head. ""You must not bother me about such things,"" she said. ""I have all that I can do to get the eggs ready, and you must look after the swarm. Nobody else can do my work, and I have no time to do yours."" As she spoke, she finished the one hundred and seventeenth egg of that day's lot, and before night came she would probably have laid more than a thousand, so you can see she was quite right when she said she had no time for other things."
"This left the Workers to plan for themselves, and they agreed that a number of them should fly out together and see where the Kingbird was."
"Then they could decide about attacking him later. When one gave the signal, they dashed out as nearly together as possible."
"After the Workers returned with honey and pollen, the Drones crowded around them, asking questions. ""Where is he? What does he look like? Did he try to catch you?"" The Workers would not answer them, and said: ""Go and find out for yourself. We all came back alive."" Then they went about their work as usual."
"""I don't see how they dared to go,"" said a very young Bee who was just out of her cocoon and was still too weak to fly."
"""Pooh!"" said the big Drone. ""You wouldn't see me hanging around this tree if I were not lame."""
"""There is no use in stopping work even if you are scared,"" said one of the Workers. She smiled as she spoke, and whispered something to the Queen-Mother as she passed her. The Queen-Mother smiled also."
"""Why don't you Drones go for honey?"" she said. ""You must be getting very hungry."""
"""We don't feel very well,"" they answered. ""Perhaps it would be better for our health if we were to keep quiet for a while and save our strength. We will lunch off some of the honey in the comb if we need food."""
"""Not a bit of it!"" exclaimed the Workers. ""Stay in the tree if you want to for your health, but don't you dare touch the honey we have gathered for winter, when the day is clear and bright like this."" And whenever a Drone tried to get food from the comb they drove him away."
"The poor Drones had a hard day of it, and at night they were so hungry they could hardly sleep. The next morning they peeped out, and then rushed away to the flowers for their breakfast. They stayed out all day, and when they returned at night they rushed swiftly into the tree again."
"""There!"" they said; ""we escaped the Kingbird."""
"""What Kingbird?"" asked a Worker."
"""The one who was there yesterday,"" answered the Drones. ""Has he been back to-day?"""
"""There was no Kingbird near the tree yesterday,"" said the Worker."
"""What!"" cried the Drones."
"""No,"" said the Queen-Mother, ""I was mistaken when I thought I heard him."
"The Workers told me after they had been out for honey. Perhaps they forgot to tell you."""
"But her eyes twinkled as she spoke, and all the Workers smiled, and for some reason the Drones did not know what to say."
THE STORY OF THE COW BIRD'S EGG
"On the edge of the forest next to the meadow, a pair of young Goldfinches were about to begin housekeeping. They were a handsome couple, and the birds who were already nesting near by were much pleased to see them tree-hunting there."
"Mr. Goldfinch was a fine, cheerful little fellow, every feather of whose black and yellow coat was always well oiled and lying in its proper place. His wife was dressed in a dull, greenish brown with a touch of yellow on her breast. ""Bright yellow and black does very well for Mr."
"Goldfinch,"" she would say, ""but for one who has to sit on the nest as long as I shall have to, it would never do. People would see me among the leaves and know just where to find my eggs."""
"Mr. Goldfinch thought that there was never a bird who had a prettier, dearer, or harder-working little wife than he, and he would wonder how he was ever happy before he knew her. That is a way that people have of forgetting the days that are past; and the truth is that Mr. Goldfinch had made fun of the Robins and other birds all spring, because they had to build nests and hunt worms for their babies, while he had nothing to do but sing and sleep and feed himself. In those days the Robins used to call after him as he flew away, ""Silly fellow! Silly fellow! Silly!"""
They knew that there is something sweeter in life than just taking good care of one's self.
"One afternoon Mr. Goldfinch saw a tiny green-brown bird on a sweetbriar bush, and as he watched her he thought her the most beautiful creature he had ever seen. She had such a dainty way of picking out the seeds, and gave such graceful hops from one twig to another. Then Mr. Goldfinch fluffed up his feathers and swelled out his throat and sang her such songs as he had never sung before. He did not want her to speak to anybody else, and yet he could not help her doing so, for Goldfinches always go together in crowds until they have homes of their own, and at this time they were having concerts every morning. He showed her where the finest dandelion seeds could be found, and one bright and sunshiny day she became Mrs. Goldfinch, and they went together to find a place for their home."
"Once upon a time, a tiger was caught in a trap. He tried in vain to get out through the bars, and rolled and bit with rage and grief when he failed."
"By chance a poor Brahman came by. ""Let me out of this cage, oh pious one!"" cried the tiger."
"""Nay, my friend,"" replied the Brahman mildly, ""you would probably eat me if I did."""
"""Not at all!"" swore the tiger with many oaths; ""on the contrary, I should be for ever grateful, and serve you as a slave!"""
"Now when the tiger sobbed and sighed and wept and swore, the pious Brahman's heart softened, and at last he consented to open the door of the cage. Out popped the tiger, and, seizing the poor man, cried, ""What a fool you are! What is to prevent my eating you now, for after being cooped up so long I am just terribly hungry!"""
In vain the Brahman pleaded for his life; the most he could gain was a promise to abide by the decision of the first three things he chose to question as to the justice of the tiger's action.
"So the Brahman first asked a pipal tree what it thought of the matter, but the pipal tree replied coldly, ""What have you to complain about? Don't I give shade and shelter to every one who passes by, and don't they in return tear down my branches to feed their cattle? Don't whimper be a man!"""
"Then the Brahman, sad at heart, went further afield till he saw a buffalo turning a well-wheel; but he fared no better from it, for it answered, ""You are a fool to expect gratitude! Look at me! Whilst I gave milk they fed me on cotton-seed and oil-cake, but now I am dry they yoke me here, and give me refuse as fodder!"""
"The Brahman, still more sad, asked the road to give him its opinion."
"""My dear sir,"" said the road, ""how foolish you are to expect anything else! Here am I, useful to everybody, yet all, rich and poor, great and small, trample on me as they go past, giving me nothing but the ashes of their pipes and the husks of their grain!"""
"On this the Brahman turned back sorrowfully, and on the way he met a jackal, who called out, ""Why, what's the matter, Mr. Brahman? You look as miserable as a fish out of water!"""
"The Brahman told him all that had occurred. ""How very confusing!"" said the jackal, when the recital was ended; ""would you mind telling me over again, for everything has got so mixed up?"""
"The Brahman told it all over again, but the jackal shook his head in a distracted sort of way, and still could not understand."
"""It's very odd,"" said he, sadly, ""but it all seems to go in at one ear and out at the other! I will go to the place where it all happened, and then perhaps I shall be able to give a judgment."""
"So they returned to the cage, by which the tiger was waiting for the Brahman, and sharpening his teeth and claws."
"""You've been away a long time!"" growled the savage beast, ""but now let us begin our dinner."""
"""Our dinner!"" thought the wretched Brahman, as his knees knocked together with fright; ""what a remarkably delicate way of putting it!"""
"""Give me five minutes, my lord!"" he pleaded, ""in order that I may explain matters to the jackal here, who is somewhat slow in his wits."""
"The tiger consented, and the Brahman began the whole story over again, not missing a single detail, and spinning as long a yarn as possible."
"""Oh, my poor brain! oh, my poor brain!"" cried the jackal, wringing its paws. ""Let me see! how did it all begin? You were in the cage, and the tiger came walking by  """
"""Pooh!"" interrupted the tiger, ""what a fool you are! I was in the cage."""
"""Of course!"" cried the jackal, pretending to tremble with fright; ""yes! I was in the cage no I wasn't dear! dear! where are my wits?"
"Let me see the tiger was in the Brahman, and the cage came walking by  no, that's not it, either! Well, don't mind me, but begin your dinner, for I shall never understand!"""
"""Yes, you shall!"" returned the tiger, in a rage at the jackal's stupidity; ""I'll make you understand! Look here I am the tiger  """
"""Yes, my lord!"""
"""And that is the Brahman  """
"""Yes, my lord!"""
"""And that is the cage  """
"""Yes, my lord!"""
"""And I was in the cage do you understand?"""
"""Yes no   Please, my lord  """
"""He just was a chap to ride!"" they said; ""so grand a knight isn't to be found in the wide world."""
"""Oh!"" said Boots, ""I should so like to have seen him, that I should."""
"""Ah!"" said his brothers, ""his mail shone a deal brighter than the glowing coals which you are always poking and digging at; nasty dirty beast that you are."""
"Next day all the knights and princes were to pass before the king and the Princess it was too late to do so the night before, I suppose that he who had the gold apple might bring it forth; but one came after another, first the Princes, and then the knights, and still no one could show the gold apple."
"""Well,"" said the king, ""some one must have it, for it was something we all saw with our own eyes, how a man came and rode up and bore it off."""
"So he commanded that every man who was in the kingdom should come up to the palace and see if they could show the apple. Well, they all came one after another, but no one had the golden apple, and after a long time the two brothers of Boots came. They were the last of all, so the king asked them if there was no one else in the kingdom who hadn't come."
"""Oh, yes,"" said they; ""we have a brother, but he never carried off the golden apple. He hasn't stirred out of the dusthole on any of the three days."""
"""Never mind that,"" said the king; ""he may as well come up to the palace like the rest."""
So Boots had to go up to the palace.
"""How now,"" said the king; ""have you got the golden apple? Speak out!"""
"""Yes, I have,"" said Boots; ""here is the first, and here is the second, and here is the third too;"" and with that he pulled all three golden apples out of his pocket, and at the same time threw off his sooty rags, and stood before them in his gleaming golden mail."
"""Yes!"" said the king; ""you shall have my daughter, and half my kingdom, for you well deserve both her and it."""
"So they got ready for the wedding, and Boots got the Princess to wife, and there was great merry-making at the bridal-feast, you may fancy, for they could all be merry though they couldn't ride up the Hill of Glass; and all I can say is, if they haven't left off their merry-making yet, why, they're still at it."
THE WIDOW'S SON
"Once on a time there was a poor, poor Widow, who had an only Son."
"She dragged on with the boy till he had been confirmed, and then she said she couldn't feed him any longer, he must just go out and earn his own bread. So the lad wandered out into the world, and when he had walked a day or so, a strange man met him."
"""Whither away?"" asked the man."
"""Whither away?"" asked the man.]"
"""Oh, I'm going out into the world to try and get a place,"" said the lad."
"""Will you come and serve me?"" said the man."
"""Oh, yes; just as soon you as any one else,"" said the lad."
"""Well, you'll have a good place with me,"" said the man; ""for you'll only have to keep me company, and do nothing at all else beside."""
"So the lad stopped with him, and lived on the fat of the land, both in meat and drink, and had little or nothing to do; but he never saw a living soul in that man's house."
So one day the man said:
"""Now, I'm going off for eight days, and that time you'll have to spend here all alone; but you must not go into any one of these four rooms here. If you do, I'll take your life when I come back."""
"""No,"" said the lad, he'd be sure not to do that. But when the man had been gone three or four days, the lad couldn't bear it any longer, but went into the first room, and when he got inside he looked round, but he saw nothing but a shelf over the door where a bramble-bush rod lay."
"Well, indeed! thought the lad; a pretty thing to forbid my seeing this."
"So when the eight days were out, the man came home, and the first thing he said was:"
"""You haven't been into any of these rooms, of course."""
"""No, no; that I haven't,"" said the lad."
"""I'll soon see that,"" said the man, and went at once into the room where the lad had been."
"""He's going to take us home,"" said Jane. ""Oh, he is a good dragon. I am glad!"""
"George was rather glad too, though neither of the children felt at all sure of their welcome, especially as their feet were wet, and they were bringing a strange dragon home with them."
"They went very fast, because dragons can go uphill as easily as down."
"You would not understand why if I told you because you are only in long division at present; yet if you want me to tell you, so that you can show off to other children, I will. It is because dragons can get their tails into the fourth dimension and hold on there, and when you can do that everything else is easy."
"The dragon went very fast, only stopping to eat the collector and the sportsman, who were still struggling to go up the slide vainly, because they had no tails, and had never even heard of the fourth dimension."
"When the dragon got to the end of the slide he crawled very slowly across the dark field beyond the field where there was a bonfire, next to the next-door garden at Forest Hill."
"He went slower and slower, and in the bonfire field he stopped altogether, and because the Arctic regions had not got down so far as that, and because the bonfire was very hot, the dragon began to melt and melt and melt and before the children knew what he was doing they found themselves sitting in a large pool of water, and their boots were as wet as wet, and there was not a bit of dragon left!"
So they went indoors.
"Of course some grown-up or other noticed at once that the boots of George and Jane were wet and muddy, and that they had both been sitting down in a very damp place, so they were sent to bed immediately."
"It was long past their time, anyhow."
"Now, if you are of an inquiring mind not at all a nice thing in a little child who reads fairy tales you will want to know how it is that since the sealskin dwarfs have all been killed, and the fires all been let out, the Aurora Borealis shines, on cold nights, as brightly as ever."
"My dear, I do not know! I am not too proud to own that there are some things I know nothing about and this is one of them. But I do know that whoever has lighted those fires again, it is certainly not the sealskin dwarfs. They were all eaten by moths and motheaten things are of no use, even to light fires!"
V. The Island of the Nine Whirlpools
"The dark arch that led to the witch's cave was hung with a black-and-yellow fringe of live snakes. As the Queen went in, keeping carefully in the middle of the arch, all the snakes lifted their wicked, flat heads and stared at her with their wicked, yellow eyes. You know it is not good manners to stare, even at Royalty, except of course for cats. And the snakes had been so badly brought up that they even put their tongues out at the poor lady. Nasty, thin, sharp tongues they were too."
"Now, the Queen's husband was, of course, the King. And besides being a King he was an enchanter, and considered to be quite at the top of his profession, so he was very wise, and he knew that when Kings and Queens want children, the Queen always goes to see a witch. So he gave the Queen the witch's address, and the Queen called on her, though she was very frightened and did not like it at all. The witch was sitting by a fire of sticks, stirring something bubbly in a shiny copper cauldron."
"""What do you want, my dear?"" she said to the Queen."
"""Oh, if you please,"" said the Queen, ""I want a baby a very nice one. We don't want any expense spared. My husband said """
"""Oh, yes,"" said the witch. ""I know all about him. And so you want a child? Do you know it will bring you sorrow?"""
"""It will bring me joy first,"" said the Queen."
"""Great sorrow,"" said the witch."
"""Greater joy,"" said the Queen."
"Then the witch said, ""Well, have your own way. I suppose it's as much as your place is worth to go back without it?"""
"""The King would be very much annoyed,"" said the poor Queen."
"""Well, well,"" said the witch. ""What will you give me for the child?"""
"""Anything you ask for, and all I have,"" said the Queen."
"""Then give me your gold crown."""
The Queen took it off quickly.
"""And your necklace of blue sapphires."""
The Queen unfastened it.
"""And your pearl bracelets."""
The Queen unclasped them.
"""You'll let me fall if you carry me like that. I won't go with you!"""
"""Don't be afraid! I'll hold you quite tight all the way."""
"Then said the crab to himself, ""If this fellow once got hold of fish, he would never let them go in a pond! Now if he should really put me into the pond, it would be capital; but if he doesn't then I'll cut his throat, and kill him!"" So he said to him:"
"""Look here, friend, you won't be able to hold me tight enough; but we crabs have a famous grip. If you let me catch hold of you round the neck with my claws, I shall be glad to go with you."""
"And the other did not see that he was trying to outwit him, and agreed. So the crab caught hold of his neck with his claws as securely as with a pair of blacksmith's pincers, and called out, ""Off with you, now!"""
"And the crane took him and showed him the pond, and then turned off towards the Varana-tree."
"""Uncle!"" cried the crab, ""the pond lies that way, but you are taking me this way!"""
"""Oh, that's it, is it?"" answered the crane. ""Your dear little uncle, your very sweet nephew, you call me! You mean me to understand, I suppose, that I am your slave, who has to lift you up and carry you about with him! Now cast your eye upon the heap of fish-bones lying at the root of yonder Varana-tree. Just as I have eaten those fish, every one of them, just so I will devour you as well!"""
"""Ah! those fishes got eaten through their own stupidity,"" answered the crab; ""but I'm not going to let you eat me. On the contrary, is it you that I am going to destroy. For you in your folly have not seen that I was outwitting you. If we die, we die both together; for I will cut off this head of yours, and cast it to the ground!"" And so saying, he gave the crane's neck a grip with his claws, as with a vice."
"Then gasping, and with tears trickling from his eyes, and trembling with the fear of death, the crane beseeched him, saying, ""O my Lord!"
"Indeed I did not intend to eat you. Grant me my life!"""
"""Well, well! step down into the pond, and put me in there."""
"And he turned round and stepped down into the pond, and placed the crab on the mud at its edge. But the crab cut through its neck as clean as one would cut a lotus-stalk with a hunting-knife, and then only entered the water!"
"When the Genius who lived in the Varana-tree saw this strange affair, he made the wood resound with his plaudits, uttering in a pleasant voice the verse:"
"""The villain, though exceeding clever,     Shall prosper not by his villainy."
"He may win indeed, sharp-witted in deceit,     But only as the Crane here from the Crab!"""
Loving Laili
"Once there was a king called King Dantal, who had a great many rupees and soldiers and horses. He had also an only son called Prince Majnun, who was a handsome boy with white teeth, red lips, blue eyes, red cheeks, red hair, and a white skin. This boy was very fond of playing with the Wazir's son, Husain Mahamat, in King Dantal's garden, which was very large and full of delicious fruits, and flowers, and trees."
They used to take their little knives there and cut the fruits and eat them. King Dantal had a teacher for them to teach them to read and write.
"One day, when they were grown two fine young men, Prince Majnun said to his father, ""Husain Mahamat and I should like to go and hunt."" His father said they might go, so they got ready their horses and all else they wanted for their hunting, and went to the Phalana country, hunting all the way, but they only founds jackals and birds."
"The Raja of the Phalana country was called Munsuk Raja, and he had a daughter named Laili, who was very beautiful; she had brown eyes and black hair."
"One night, some time before Prince Majnun came to her father's kingdom, as she slept, Khuda sent to her an angel in the form of a man who told her that she should marry Prince Majnun and no one else, and that this was Khuda's command to her. When Laili woke she told her father of the angel's visit to her as she slept; but her father paid no attention to her story. From that time she began repeating, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun,"" and would say nothing else. Even as she sat and ate her food she kept saying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun."" Her father used to get quite vexed with her. ""Who is this Majnun? who ever heard of this Majnun?"" he would say."
"""He is the man I am to marry,"" said Laili. ""Khuda has ordered me to marry no one but Majnun."" And she was half mad."
"Meanwhile, Majnun and Husain Mahamat came to hunt in the Phalana country; and as they were riding about, Laili came out on her horse to eat the air, and rode behind them. All the time she kept saying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun."" The prince heard her, and turned round. ""Who is calling me?"" he asked. At this Laili looked at him, and the moment she saw him she fell deeply in love with him, and she said to herself, ""I am sure that is the Prince Majnun that Khuda says I am to marry."" And she went home to her father and said, ""Father, I wish to marry the prince who has come to your kingdom; for I know he is the Prince Majnun I am to marry."""
"""Very well, you shall have him for your husband,"" said Munsuk Raja."
"""We will ask him to-morrow."" Laili consented to wait, although she was very impatient. As it happened, the prince left the Phalana kingdom that night, and when Laili heard he was gone, she went quite mad. She would not listen to a word her father, or her mother, or her servants said to her, but went off into the jungle, and wandered from jungle to jungle, till she got farther and farther away from her own country."
"All the time she kept saying, ""Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun;"" and so she wandered about for twelve years."
"At the end of the twelve years she met a fakir he was really an angel, but she did not know this who asked her, ""Why do you always say, 'Majnun, Majnun; I want Majnun'?"" She answered, ""I am the daughter of the king of the Phalana country, and I want to find Prince Majnun; tell me where his kingdom is."""
"""I think you will never get there,"" said the fakir, ""for it is very far from hence, and you have to cross many rivers to reach it."" But Laili said she did not care; she must see Prince Majnun. ""Well,"" said the fakir, ""when you come to the Bhagirathi river you will see a big fish, a Rohu; and you must get him to carry you to Prince Majnun's country, or you will never reach it."""
"She went on and on, and at last she came to the Bhagirathi river."
"There was a great big fish called the Rohu fish. It was yawning just as she got up to it, and she instantly jumped down its throat into its stomach. All the time she kept saying, ""Majnun, Majnun."" At this the Rohu fish was greatly alarmed and swam down the river as fast as he could. By degrees he got tired and went slower, and a crow came and perched on his back, and said ""Caw, caw."" ""Oh, Mr. Crow,"" said the poor fish ""do see what is in my stomach that makes such a noise."""
"The Rattlesnake, for it was he, raised his head to look at the bird. The young Blue Jay saw that his eyes were very bright. He looked right into them, and could see little pictures of himself upon their shining surfaces. He stood still to look, and the Rattlesnake came nearer. Then the young Blue Jay tried to see his tail, but he couldn't look away from the Rattlesnake's eyes, though he tried ever so hard."
"The Rattlesnake now coiled up his body, flattened out his head, and showed his teeth, while all the time his queer forked tongue ran in and out of his mouth. Then the young Blue Jay tried to move and found that he couldn't. All he could do was to stand there and watch those glowing eyes and listen to the song which the Rattlesnake began to sing:"
"""Through grass and fern,   With many a turn,     My shining body I draw."
"In woodland shade   My home is made,     For this is the Forest Law."
"""Whoever tries   To look in my eyes     Comes near to my poisoned jaw;   And birds o'erbold   I charm and hold,     For this is the Forest Law."""
"The Rattlesnake drew nearer and nearer, and the young Blue Jay was shaking with fright, when there was a rustle of wings, and his father and mother flew down and around the Rattlesnake, screaming loudly to all the other Jays, and making the Snake turn away from the helpless little bird he had been about to strike. It was a long time before the forest was quiet again, and when it was, the Blue Jay family were safely in their nest, and the Rattlesnake had gone home without his supper."
"After the young Blue Jay got over his fright, he began to complain because he had not seen the Rattlesnake's tail. Then, indeed, his patient mother gave him such a scolding as he had never had in all his life, and his father said that he deserved a sound pecking for his foolishness."
"When the young Blue Jay showed that he was sorry for all the trouble that he had made, his parents let him have some supper and go to bed; but not until he had learned two sayings which he was always to remember. And these were the sayings: ""A really brave bird dares to be afraid of some things,"" and, ""If you go near enough to see the tail of a danger, you may be struck by its head."""
THE RED SQUIRRELS BEGIN HOUSEKEEPING
"The first thing that Mr. Red Squirrel did after coming to the forest and meeting the Gray Squirrel was to look for something to eat. It was not a good season for a stranger who had no hidden store of nuts and seeds to draw upon. The apples and corn were not ripe, and last year's seeds and acorns were nearly gone. What few remained here and there had lost their sweet and wholesome taste. Poor Mr. Red Squirrel began to wish that he had eaten breakfast before he ran away. He even went to the edge of the forest and looked over toward the farmhouse, where his open cage hung in the sunshine. He knew that there were nuts and a fresh bit of fruit inside of it, and his mouth watered at the thought of them, but he was a sensible young fellow, and he knew that if he went back to eat, the cage door would be snapped shut, and he would never again be free to scamper in the beautiful trees."
"""I will starve first!"" he said to himself, and he was so much in earnest that he spoke quite loudly."
"The words were hardly out of his mouth when ""Pft!"" a fat acorn came down at his feet. He caught it up with his forepaws before looking around. It was smooth and glossy, not at all as though it had passed a long winter on an oak branch. He took a good nibble at it and then looked up to see if there were more on the tree above him. You can think how surprised he was to find himself sitting beneath a maple, for in all the years since the world began no maple has ever borne acorns."
"""There are no more to come,"" he said. ""I must take small bites and make it last as long as I can."" And he turned it around and around, clutching it tightly with his long, crooked claws, so that not the tiniest bit could be lost. At last it was all eaten, not a crumb was left, and then ""Pft!"" down came a walnut. This hit him squarely on the back, but he was too hungry to mind, and he ate it all, just stopping long enough to say:"
"""If this maple bears such fruit as acorns and walnuts, I should like to live in a maple grove."""
"Next came a hazelnut, then a butternut, and last of all a fat kernel of yellow corn. He knew now that some friend was hidden in the branches above, so he tucked the corn in one of his cheek-pockets, and scampered up the maple trunk to find out who it was. He saw a whisking reddish-brown tail, and knew that some other Red Squirrel was there. But whoever it was did not mean to be caught, and such a chase as he had!"
"Just as he thought he had overtaken his unknown friend, he could see nothing more of her, and he was almost vexed to think how careless he must have been to miss her. He ran up and down the tree on which he last saw her, and found a little hollow in one of its large branches. He looked in, and there she was, the same dainty creature whom he had so often watched from his cage. He could see that she was breathless from running so fast, yet she pretended to be surprised at seeing him."
"Perhaps she now thought that she had been too bold in giving him food, and so wanted him to think that it had been somebody else."
"""Good morning!"" said he. ""Thank you very much for your kindness."""
"""What do you mean?"" said she."
"""As though you didn't know!"" he answered. ""I never heard of a maple tree that bore acorns, nuts, and corn, and that in the springtime."""
"""Oh, well,"" said she, tossing her pretty head, ""you have lived in a cage and may not know what our forest trees can do."""
"That was a rather saucy thing to say, but Mr. Red Squirrel knew her kind heart and that she said it only in mischief. ""How do you know I have lived in a cage?"" he asked."
"""I I thought you looked like the Squirrel at the farmhouse,"" she said; and then forgetting herself, she added, ""You did look so surprised when that walnut hit you."""
"""Where were you then?"" he asked quickly."
"""Oh! I was on a branch above you,"" she answered, seeing that he now knew all about it. ""You looked so hungry, and I had plenty of food stored away. You may have some whenever you wish. It must have been dreadful in that cage."""
"Now Mr. Red Squirrel had loved his little friend ever since the first time he saw her on the rail fence, but he had never thought she would care for him a tired, discouraged fellow, who had passed such a sorrowful life in prison. Yet when he heard her pitying words, and saw the light in her tender eyes, he wondered if he could win her for his wife."
"""I shall never be able to do anything for you,"" said he. ""You are young and beautiful and know the forest ways. I am a stranger and saddened by my hard life. I wish I could help you."""
"""The Blue Jays! The Blue Jays!"" she cried, starting up. ""They have found my hidden acorns and are eating them."""
"And sure enough, a pair of those handsome robbers were pulling acorn after acorn out of a tree-hollow near by, and eating them as fast as they could. You should have seen Mr. Red Squirrel then! He leaped from branch to branch until he reached the Blue Jays; then he stood by the hole where the acorns were stored, and scolded them."
"""Chickaree-chickaree-quilch-quilch-chickaree-chickaree!"" he said; and that in the Red Squirrel language is a very severe scolding. He jumped about with his head down and his tail jerking, while his eyes gleamed like coals of fire. The Blue Jays made a great fuss and called ""Jay!"
"Jay!"" at him, and made fun of him for being a stranger, but they left at last, and Mr. Red Squirrel turned to his friend."
"The next day it rained, and the next, and the next. Mrs. Goldfinch did not dare leave her nest to make calls, lest the cold raindrops should chill and hurt the four tiny birds that lay curled up in their shells."
"At last the weather was warm and sunshiny, and Mrs. Goldfinch and some of her bird neighbors went to call on Mrs. Mourning Dove. They found her just coming from a wheat-field, where she had been to get grain. ""Oh, you poor creature!"" they cried. ""We have heard all about it. Your poor babies! How sorry we are for you!"""
"Mrs. Mourning Dove looked from one to another as though she did not know what to make of it. ""What do you mean?"" she cooed. ""My babies are well and doing finely. Won't you come to see them?"""
"Then it was the turn of the other birds to be surprised. ""Why,"" they chirped, ""we heard that your eggs had fallen through your nest and had broken and killed the tiny Dove babies inside. Is it true?"""
"""Not a word of it,"" answered Mrs. Mourning Dove. ""The nest is all right, and the eggs were not broken until my two little darlings broke them with their sharp beaks."""
"""Here they are,"" she added, fondly. ""Did you ever see such pretty ones?"
"See him open his bill, the dear! And did you ever see such a neck as she has? Mr. Mourning Dove thinks there never were such children."""
"""But do you feel perfectly safe to leave them in that nest?"" asked the Oriole politely. ""My babies are so restless that I should be afraid to trust them in it."""
"""That is what people always say,"" answered Mrs. Mourning Dove, with a happy coo, ""and I fear that I am a rather poor housekeeper, but it runs in our family. Mr. Mourning Dove and I have raised many pairs of children, and they never rolled out, or tumbled through, or blew away, and I do not worry about these. I shall never be thrifty like you good builders, perhaps, but I'm sure you cannot love your little ones any more than I do mine. It was very kind of you to be so sorry for me when you heard I was in trouble. I think I have the best neighbors in the world."""
"When her callers went away, they could not say enough about Mrs."
"Mourning Dove's pleasant ways, and her gentle, well-behaved children."
"""It is too bad she is such a poor nest-maker,"" the Vireo said, ""and I understand now what she meant when she told me that they sometimes used old Robins' nests for their young. She said they flattened them out and added a few twigs, and that they did finely. I thought it very queer in them to do so, but perhaps if I had not been a good builder I should have done the same thing."""
"""Perhaps we all would,"" the others agreed. ""She certainly is a very pleasant bird, and she is bringing up her children well. Mr. Mourning Dove seems to think her perfect. We won't worry any more about her."""
THE YOUNG BLUE JAY WHO WAS NOT BRAVE ENOUGH TO BE AFRAID
Everybody who is acquainted with the Blue Jays knows that they are a very brave family. That is the best thing that you can say about them.
"To be sure, they dress very handsomely, and there is no prettier sight, on a fine winter morning, than a flock of Blue Jays flitting from branch to branch, dining off the acorns on the oak trees, and cocking their crested heads on one side as they look over the country. They are great talkers then, and are always telling each other just what to do; yet none of them ever do what they are told to, so they might just as well stop giving advice."
"The other people of the forest do not like the Blue Jays at all, and if one of them gets into trouble they will not help him out. This always has been so, and it always will be so. If it could be winter all the time, the Blue Jays could be liked well enough, for in cold weather they eat seeds and nuts and do not quarrel so much with others. It is in the summer that they become bad neighbors. Then they live in the thickest part of the woods and raise families of tiny, fuzzy babies in their great coarse nests. It is then, too, that they change their beautiful coats, and while the old feathers are dropping off and the new ones are growing they are not at all pretty. Oh, then is the time to beware of the Blue Jays!"
"They do very little talking during the summer, and the forest people do not know when they are coming, unless they see a flutter of blue wings among the branches. The Blue Jays have a reason for keeping still then."
"They are doing sly things, and they do not want to be found out."
The wee babies grow fast and their mouths are always open for more food.
"Father and Mother Blue Jay spend all their time in marketing, and they are not content with seeds and berries. They visit the nests of their bird neighbors, and then something very sad happens. When the Blue Jays go to a nest there may be four eggs in it; but when they go away there will not be any left, nothing but pieces of broken egg-shell. It is very, very sad, but this is another of the things which will always be so, and all that the other birds can do is to watch and drive the Jays away."
"There was once a young Blue Jay in the forest who was larger than his brothers and sisters, and kept crowding them toward the edge of the nest. When their father came with a bit of food for them, he would stretch his legs and flutter his wings and reach up for the first bite."
"And because he was the largest and the strongest, he usually got it."
"Sometimes, too, the first bite was so big that there was nothing left for anyone else to bite at. He was a very greedy fellow, and he had no right to take more than his share, just because he happened to be the first of the family to break open the shell, or because he grew fast."
"This same young Blue Jay used to brag about what he would do when he got out of the nest, and his mother told him that he would get into trouble if he were not careful. She said that even Blue Jays had to look out for danger."
"""Huh!"" said the young Blue Jay; ""who's afraid?"""
"""Now you talk like a bully,"" said Mother Blue Jay, ""for people who are really brave are always willing to be careful."""
"But the young Blue Jay only crowded his brothers and sisters more than usual, and thought, inside his foolish little pin-feathery head, that when he got a chance, he'd show them what courage was."
"After a while his chance came. All the small birds had learned to flutter from branch to branch, and to hop quite briskly over the ground."
"One afternoon they went to a part of the forest where the ground was damp and all was strange. The father and mother told their children to keep close together and they would take care of them; but the foolish young Blue Jay wanted a chance to go alone, so he hid behind a tree until the others were far ahead, and then he started off another way. It was great fun for a time, and when the feathered folk looked down at him he raised his crest higher than ever and thought how he would scare them when he was a little older."
"The young Blue Jay was just thinking about this when he saw something long and shining lying in the pathway ahead. He remembered what his father had said about snakes, and about one kind that wore rattles on their tails. He wondered if this one had a rattle, and he made up his mind to see how it was fastened on. ""I am a Blue Jay,"" he said to himself, ""and I was never yet afraid of anything."""
"The strange rabbit stopped dancing, and came quite close. He came so close this time that his long whiskers brushed the Velveteen Rabbit's ear, and then he wrinkled his nose suddenly and flattened his ears and jumped backwards."
"""He doesn't smell right!"" he exclaimed. ""He isn't a rabbit at all! He isn't real!"""
"""I am Real!"" said the little Rabbit. ""I am Real! The Boy said so!"" And he nearly began to cry."
"Just then there was a sound of footsteps, and the Boy ran past near them, and with a stamp of feet and a flash of white tails the two strange rabbits disappeared."
"""Come back and play with me!"" called the little Rabbit. ""Oh, do come back! I know I am Real!"""
"But there was no answer, only the little ants ran to and fro, and the bracken swayed gently where the two strangers had passed. The Velveteen Rabbit was all alone."
"""Oh, dear!"" he thought. ""Why did they run away like that? Why couldn't they stop and talk to me?"""
"For a long time he lay very still, watching the bracken, and hoping that they would come back. But they never returned, and presently the sun sank lower and the little white moths fluttered out, and the Boy came and carried him home."
"Weeks passed, and the little Rabbit grew very old and shabby, but the Boy loved him just as much. He loved him so hard that he loved all his whiskers off, and the pink lining to his ears turned grey, and his brown spots faded. He even began to lose his shape, and he scarcely looked like a rabbit any more, except to the Boy. To him he was always beautiful, and that was all that the little Rabbit cared about. He didn't mind how he looked to other people, because the nursery magic had made him Real, and when you are Real shabbiness doesn't matter."
"And then, one day, the Boy was ill."
"His face grew very flushed, and he talked in his sleep, and his little body was so hot that it burned the Rabbit when he held him close."
"Strange people came and went in the nursery, and a light burned all night and through it all the little Velveteen Rabbit lay there, hidden from sight under the bedclothes, and he never stirred, for he was afraid that if they found him some one might take him away, and he knew that the Boy needed him."
"It was a long weary time, for the Boy was too ill to play, and the little Rabbit found it rather dull with nothing to do all day long."
"But he snuggled down patiently, and looked forward to the time when the Boy should be well again, and they would go out in the garden amongst the flowers and the butterflies and play splendid games in the raspberry thicket like they used to. All sorts of delightful things he planned, and while the Boy lay half asleep he crept up close to the pillow and whispered them in his ear. And presently the fever turned, and the Boy got better. He was able to sit up in bed and look at picture-books, while the little Rabbit cuddled close at his side. And one day, they let him get up and dress."
"It was a bright, sunny morning, and the windows stood wide open. They had carried the Boy out on to the balcony, wrapped in a shawl, and the little Rabbit lay tangled up among the bedclothes, thinking."
"The Boy was going to the seaside to-morrow. Everything was arranged, and now it only remained to carry out the doctor's orders. They talked about it all, while the little Rabbit lay under the bedclothes, with just his head peeping out, and listened. The room was to be disinfected, and all the books and toys that the Boy had played with in bed must be burnt."
"""Hurrah!"" thought the little Rabbit. ""To-morrow we shall go to the seaside!"" For the boy had often talked of the seaside, and he wanted very much to see the big waves coming in, and the tiny crabs, and the sand castles."
Just then Nana caught sight of him.
"""How about his old Bunny?"" she asked."
"""That?"" said the doctor. ""Why, it's a mass of scarlet fever germs!-Burn it at once. What? Nonsense! Get him a new one. He mustn't have that any more!"""
Anxious Times
"And so the little Rabbit was put into a sack with the old picture-books and a lot of rubbish, and carried out to the end of the garden behind the fowl-house. That was a fine place to make a bonfire, only the gardener was too busy just then to attend to it. He had the potatoes to dig and the green peas to gather, but next morning he promised to come quite early and burn the whole lot."
"That night the Boy slept in a different bedroom, and he had a new bunny to sleep with him. It was a splendid bunny, all white plush with real glass eyes, but the Boy was too excited to care very much about it. For to-morrow he was going to the seaside, and that in itself was such a wonderful thing that he could think of nothing else."
"And while the Boy was asleep, dreaming of the seaside, the little Rabbit lay among the old picture-books in the corner behind the fowl-house, and he felt very lonely. The sack had been left untied, and so by wriggling a bit he was able to get his head through the opening and look out. He was shivering a little, for he had always been used to sleeping in a proper bed, and by this time his coat had worn so thin and threadbare from hugging that it was no longer any protection to him. Near by he could see the thicket of raspberry canes, growing tall and close like a tropical jungle, in whose shadow he had played with the Boy on bygone mornings. He thought of those long sunlit hours in the garden-how happy they were-and a great sadness came over him. He seemed to see them all pass before him, each more beautiful than the other, the fairy huts in the flower-bed, the quiet evenings in the wood when he lay in the bracken and the little ants ran over his paws; the wonderful day when he first knew that he was Real. He thought of the Skin Horse, so wise and gentle, and all that he had told him. Of what use was it to be loved and lose one's beauty and become Real if it all ended like this? And a tear, a real tear, trickled down his little shabby velvet nose and fell to the ground."
"And then a strange thing happened. For where the tear had fallen a flower grew out of the ground, a mysterious flower, not at all like any that grew in the garden. It had slender green leaves the colour of emeralds, and in the centre of the leaves a blossom like a golden cup."
"It was so beautiful that the little Rabbit forgot to cry, and just lay there watching it. And presently the blossom opened, and out of it there stepped a fairy."
"She was quite the loveliest fairy in the whole world. Her dress was of pearl and dew-drops, and there were flowers round her neck and in her hair, and her face was like the most perfect flower of all. And she came close to the little Rabbit and gathered him up in her arms and kissed him on his velveteen nose that was all damp from crying."
"""Little Rabbit,"" she said, ""don't you know who I am?"""
"The Rabbit looked up at her, and it seemed to him that he had seen her face before, but he couldn't think where."
"""I am the nursery magic Fairy,"" she said. ""I take care of all the playthings that the children have loved. When they are old and worn out and the children don't need them any more, then I come and take them away with me and turn them into Real."""
"""Wasn't I Real before?"" asked the little Rabbit."
"""You were Real to the Boy,"" the Fairy said, ""because he loved you. Now you shall be Real to every one."""
"But the king would not listen. ""Take them away and cut off their heads,"""
he cried angrily. And when his nobles begged him to spare such brave enemies he would not listen to them.
"Then Queen Philippa, whose heart was filled with pity for the poor men, fell upon her knees."
"""My lord,"" she cried, ""if you love me, give me the lives of these men."""
"King Edward could not bear to see his beautiful queen in tears upon the ground, so he raised her, saying: ""Lady, I wish you had not been here, for I cannot say you nay. Take the men, they are yours."""
"Then Queen Philippa joyfully led the brave men away, and gave them food and clothes, and sent them back to their friends. So they, and all the people of Calais, were saved."
Wat Tyler
"In our days, all people in our land, except prisoners, are free to go where they will, and to do what work they please. In olden times it was not so. Then, the poorer people were treated like slaves by the nobles; they had to work hard for their masters, and they were not allowed to move from one place to another without asking leave."
"This was hard, and it made the people very angry. In the days of the boy-king Richard II, a great many workmen made up their minds to obey the nobles no longer. They banded themselves together in a large army, chose a man named Wat Tyler for their leader, and marched to London."
"The Mayor of London tried to stop them, by pulling up the drawbridge which crossed the river Thames, but they forced him by threats to let it down again. Then they rushed through the streets of London, frightening all the people they met by their wild looks and cries. They broke open the prisons, and set the prisoners free, and burned the palaces of the nobles, but they killed no man and robbed none."
"The nobles were much alarmed. With young King Richard at their head, they rode out to meet this army, and to ask the people what they wanted."
"""We want to be free, and we want our children to be free after us,"" said Wat Tyler."
"""I promise you that you shall have your wish, if you will return quietly to your homes,"" said the king."
"At this, the people shouted with joy, and all might have been well; but the mayor, seeing Wat Tyler raise his hand, and fearing that he was going to strike the king, drew his sword, and killed the leader of the people."
"Then the joyful shouts changed to cries and growls of anger. Arms were raised, and the crowd began to press forward. In a minute the little band of nobles would have been attacked, but the boy-king saw the danger. Boldly riding to meet the angry people, he put himself at their head. ""What need ye, my masters?"" cried he. ""I am your captain and your king. Follow me."""
"The crowd stopped, surprised by this bold act; the loud cries ceased, and swords and staves were lowered. These rough men did not wish to harm their young sovereign, but to free him from the nobles who gave him evil counsel. They were greatly pleased to find him upon their side, and, with perfect trust and loyalty, they followed where he led; and so for a time the danger was past."
Bruce and the Spider
"Robert Bruce, King of Scotland, sad and weary, lay upon the floor of a lonely cave among the hills. His mind was full of anxious thoughts, for he was hiding from the English soldiers, who sought to take him alive or dead to their king. The brave Scots had lost many battles, and Bruce began to fear that he would never make his dear country free."
"""I will give up trying,"" said he."
"Just then a spider, hanging from the roof of the cave, by a long thread, swung before the king's eyes, and he left his gloomy thoughts to see what the little creature would do."
"The spider began to climb its thread slowly, pulling itself up little by little; but it had gone only a short way, when it slipped and fell to the end once more."
"Again and again it started to climb, and again and again it slipped back, until it had fallen six times."
"""Surely the silly little creature will now give up trying to climb so fine a thread,"" thought Bruce. But the spider did no such thing. It started on its upward journey yet a seventh time, and this time it did not fall. Up it went, inch by inch, higher and higher, until at last it reached the roof, and was safely at home."
"""Bravo!"" cried the king. ""The spider has taught me a lesson. I too will try until I win."""
"Bruce kept his word. He led his brave men to battle, again and again, until at last the English were driven back to their own land, and Scotland was free."
Richard and Blondel
"He found the way both dark and unpleasant, but he thought he would go on as long as it became no worse. But all at once he felt ice cold water spouting about his ears; he became frightened to death and began tugging at the rope."
"The lieutenant was the next to try, but it fared no better with him."
"No sooner had he got through the flood of water than he saw a blazing fire yawning beneath him, which so frightened him that he also turned back."
"The soldier then got into the bucket, and down he went through fire and water, right on till he came to the bottom, where it was so pitch dark that he could not see his hand before him. He dared not let go the basket, but went round in a circle, feeling and fumbling about him. At last he discovered a gleam of light far, far away like the dawn of day, and he went on in that direction."
"When he had gone a bit it began to grow light around him, and before long he saw a golden sun rising in the sky and everything around him became as bright and beautiful as if in a fairy world."
"First he came to some cattle, which were so fat that their hides glistened a long way off, and when he had got past them he came to a fine, big palace. He walked through many rooms without meeting anybody. At last he heard the hum of a spinning wheel, and when he entered the room he found the eldest Princess sitting there spinning copper yarn; the room and everything in it was of brightly polished copper."
"""Oh, dear; oh, dear! what are Christian people doing here?"" said the Princess. ""Heaven preserve you! what do you want?"""
"""I want to set you free and get you out of the mountain,"" said the soldier."
"""Pray do not stay. If the troll comes home he will put an end to you at once; he has three heads,"" said she."
"""I do not care if he has four,"" said the soldier. ""I am here, and here I shall remain."""
"""Well, if you will be so headstrong, I must see if I can help you,"""
said the Princess.
She then told him to creep behind the big brewing vat which stood in the front hall; meanwhile she would receive the troll and scratch his heads till he went to sleep.
"""And when I go out and call the hens you must make haste and come in,"""
"she said. ""But you must first try if you can swing the sword which is lying on the table."" No, it was too heavy, he could not even move it."
"He had then to take a strengthening draught from the horn, which hung behind the door; after that he was just able to stir it, so he took another draught, and then he could lift it. At last he took a right, big draught, and he could swing the sword as easily as anything."
All at once the troll came home; he walked so heavily that the palace shook.
"""Ugh, ugh! I smell Christian flesh and blood in my house,"" said he."
"""Yes,"" answered the Princess, ""a raven flew past here just now, and in his beak he had a human bone, which he dropped down the chimney; I threw it out and swept and cleaned up after it, but I suppose it still smells."""
"""So it does,"" said the troll."
"""But come and lie down and I'll scratch your heads,"" said the Princess; ""the smell will be gone by the time you wake."""
"The troll was quite willing, and before long he fell asleep and began snoring. When she saw he was sleeping soundly, she placed some stools and cushions under his heads and went to call the hens. The soldier then stole into the room with the sword, and with one blow cut all the three heads off the troll."
"The Princess was as pleased as a fiddler, and went with the soldier to her sisters, so that he could also set them free. First of all they went across a courtyard and then through many long rooms till they came to a big door."
"""Here you must enter: here she is,"" said the Princess. When he opened the door he found himself in a large hall, where everything was of pure silver; there sat the second sister at a silver spinning-wheel."
"""Oh, dear; oh, dear!"" she said. ""What do you want here?"""
"""I want to set you free from the troll,"" said the soldier."
"""Pray do not stay, but go,"" said the Princess. ""If he finds you here he will take your life on the spot."""
"""That would be awkward that is if I don't take his first,"" said the soldier."
"""Well, since you will stay,"" she said, ""you will have to creep behind the big brewing-vat in the front hall. But you must make haste and come as soon as you hear me calling the hens."""
"First of all he had to try if he was able to swing the troll's sword, which lay on the table; it was much larger and heavier than the first one; he was hardly able to move it. He then took three draughts from the horn and he could then lift it, and when he had taken three more he could handle it as if it were a rolling pin."
"Shortly afterwards he heard a heavy, rumbling noise that was quite terrible, and directly afterwards a troll with six heads came in."
"""No,"" answered the Queen-Mother, ""I don't. You see, I have so much to think about, and happy thoughts make tasks light. And then, you know, it is not always the same kind of egg, and that makes a pleasant change for me. I will give you a motto to remember: 'As long as a Bee is well, work is pleasant when done faithfully.'"""
"""Perhaps that is the matter with me,"" said the Worker, raising her drooping head. ""I have been careless lately when I thought nobody was looking. I will try your way."""
"When she had gone, the Queen-Mother smiled to herself and said: ""Poor child! When work is no longer a pleasure, life is indeed sad. But any Larva should know better than to work carelessly when she is not watched."""
THE HAUGHTY GROUND HOG
"Not far from the home of the Rabbits was another burrow where the Ground Hog lived, and there was a very kindly feeling between the neighbors."
"They liked the same food, and as there was plenty for all, they often nibbled together near the edge of the forest. The little Rabbits were fond of him and liked to listen to his stories. Once the biggest little Rabbit had run into the Ground Hog's burrow by mistake when he was frightened, and that was the beginning of a great friendship between them."
"They were a queer-looking couple, for the Rabbit was small and quick and dainty, while the Ground Hog, with his stout body covered with thick, reddish fur, his broad, flat head, and his short legs, was a clumsy fellow. To be sure, he could get out of sight quickly if he had to, but he never scampered around and kicked up his heels for the fun of it, as the Rabbits did. He was too dignified to do that. He came of an old family and he could remember who his grandfather was. There were but few people in the forest who could do that; so, of course, he could not frisk like his neighbors."
"Perhaps if the Ground Hog had not belonged to so old a family, he might have had a better time. Yet the thought that he could remember his grandfather was a great pleasure to him, and when he was talking he would often remark in the most careless way, ""as my grandfather used to say""; or, ""That reminds me of something my grandfather once did."" Some people said that he did this to show off; but it may be that they were envious."
"However that may have been, the Ground Hog was certainly a haughty fellow, and if he had not been so gentle and kind a neighbor people would not have liked him. Only once had he been known to get angry, and that was when a saucy young Chipmunk had spoken of him as a Woodchuck."
"""Woodchuck! Woodchuck!"" he had grunted. ""You young Bushy-tail, I am a Ground Hog, and the Ground Hog family lived in this forest long before you ever opened your eyes. People with good manners do not call us 'Woodchucks.' We do not like the name. My grandfather could not endure it."""
"It was not very long after this that he told the wondering young Rabbits about his grandfather. When talking, the Ground Hog rested by the edge of his burrow, sitting on his haunches, and waving his queer little forepaws whenever he told anything especially important. And this was the story:"
"""Perhaps you may have heard me speak of my grandfather. Ah, he was a Ground Hog worth seeing! He was large, and, although when I knew him the black fur on his back was streaked with gray, he was still handsome. He was clever, too. I have often heard my father say that he could dig the deepest and best burrow in the forest. And then he had such fine manners! There was not another Ground Hog in the country around who could eat as noisily as he, and it is said that when he was courting my grandmother she chose him because of the elegant way in which he sat up on his haunches. I have been told, children, that I am very much like him."""
"Just here, a Red-headed Woodpecker gave a loud ""Rat-a-tat-tat"" on the tree above the Ground Hog's head, and there was a look around her bill as though she wanted to laugh. The Ground Hog slowly turned his head to look at her as she flew away. ""Quite a good-looking young person,"" he said, ""but badly brought up. She should know better than to disturb those who are talking. What was I saying, children?"""
"""You were telling how well your grandfather sat up on his haunches,"""
said the smallest little Rabbit.
"""So I was! So I was! I must tell you how my grandfather came to know the world so well. When he was only a young fellow, he made his home for a time by a Hen house, and so heard the talk of the barn-yard people."
"Once he heard them tell how the farmer watched on a certain winter day to see my grandfather come out of his burrow. Of course, you children all know how we Ground Hogs do; in the fall we are very fat, and when the cold weather comes we go to sleep in our burrows to wait for spring."
"Sometimes we awaken and stretch, but we go to sleep again very soon."
"Then, when spring comes we are slender and have healthy appetites."
"""The Hens treated my grandfather with great politeness, and the Black Brahma Cock showed plainly how honored they felt to have him there. They said that they were so glad my grandfather stayed out of his burrow awhile on this winter day when the farmer was watching, because they were in a hurry for warm weather. My grandfather did not know what they meant by that, but he was too wise to say so, and he found out by asking questions, that if a Ground Hog leaves his burrow on this certain day in winter, and sees his shadow, and goes back again, it will be cold for a long time after that. If he does not see his shadow, and stays out, it will soon be warm."
"""You see now, children, how important our family is; and yet we are so modest that we had not even known that we made the weather until the Hens told my grandfather. But that is the way! Really great people often think the least of themselves."""
"""And do you make the weather?"" asked the smallest little Rabbit."
"""I suppose we do,"" said the Ground Hog, with a smile. ""It is a great care. I often say to myself: 'Shall I have it warm, or shall I have it cold?' It worries me so that sometimes I can hardly eat."""
"""And how do you know when the day comes for you to make the weather?"""
said the smallest little rabbit.
"""Ahem! Well-er! I am sorry to say that my grandfather did not find out exactly what day it is that they watch for us, so I have to guess at that. But to think that we Ground Hogs make the weather for all the other people! It is worth a great deal to belong to such a family. I suppose I might have been a Weasel, a Fox, an Owl, or an Oriole. And it is a great thing to have known one's grandfather."""
"The little Rabbits sat very still, wishing that they had known their grandfather, when suddenly the biggest one said: ""If you should stay out of your burrow when that day comes, and another Ground Hog should go back into his burrow, how would the weather know what to do?"""
"""Children,"" said the old Ground Hog, ""I think your mother is calling to you. You might better go to see. Good-by."" And he waved his paw politely."
"The seven little Rabbits scampered away, but their mother was not calling them. She wasn't even there, and when they went back they couldn't find the Ground Hog. They wondered how he happened to make such a mistake. The Red-headed Woodpecker who came along at about that time, twisted her head on one side and said: ""Made-a-mistake! Rat-a-tat-tat!"
"Not he!"""
"What tangles they did get into! Each little Rabbit had four legs, two short ones in front, and two long ones behind to help him take long jumps from one place to another. So, you see, there were twenty-eight legs there, pushing, catching in the hay, kicking, and sometimes just waving in the air when their tiny owners chanced to roll over on their backs and couldn't get right side up again. Then Mamma Rabbit would come and poke them this way and that, never hurting any of them, but getting the nest in order."
"""It is a great deal of work to pick up after children,"" she would say with a tired little sigh, ""but it will not be long before they have homes of their own and are doing the same thing."""
"Mamma Rabbit was quite right when she said that, for all of their people set up housekeeping when very young, and then the cares of life begin."
"One fine morning when the children were alone in their burrow, the biggest little Rabbit had a queer feeling in his face, below and in front of his long ears, and above his eager little nose. It almost scared him at first, for he had never before felt anything at all like it. Then he guessed what it meant. There were two bunchy places on his face, that Mamma Rabbit had told him were eyes. ""When you are older,"""
"she had said to him, ""these eyes will open, and then you will see."" For the Rabbit children are always blind when they are babies."
"When his mother told him that, the biggest little Rabbit had said, ""What do you mean when you say I shall 'see'? Is it anything like eating?"""
"And Mamma Rabbit said, ""No, you cannot taste things until you touch them, but you can see them when they are far away."""
"""Then it is like smelling,"" said the biggest little Rabbit."
"""No, it is not like smelling, either, for there are many things, like stones, which one cannot smell and yet can see."""
"""Then it surely is like hearing,"" said the biggest little Rabbit."
"""Oh dear!"" exclaimed his mother, who was tired of having questions asked which could not be answered. ""It is not a bit like hearing. You could never hear a black cloud coming across the sky, but you could see it if you were outside your burrow. Nobody can make you understand what seeing is until your eyes are open, and then you will find out for yourself without asking."""
"This made the biggest little Rabbit lie still for a while, and then he said: ""What is a black cloud, and why does it come across the sky? And what is the sky, and why does it let the cloud come? And what is "" But he did not get any answer, for his mother ran out of the burrow as fast as she could."
"And now his eyes were surely opening and he should see! His tiny heart thumped hard with excitement, and he rubbed his face with his forepaws to make his eyes open faster. Ah! There it was; something round and bright at the other end of the burrow, and some queer, slender things were waving across it. He wondered if it were good to eat, but he dared not crawl toward it to see. He did not know that the round, bright thing was just a bit of sky which he saw through the end of the burrow, and that the slender, waving ones were the branches of a dead tree tossing in the wind. Then he looked at his brothers and sisters as they lay beside him. He would not have known what they were if he had not felt of them at the same time."
"""I can see!"" he cried. ""I can see everything that there is to see! I'm ahead of you! Don't you wish that you could see, too?"""
"That was not a very kind thing to say, but in a minute more his brothers and sisters had reason to be glad that they couldn't see. Even while he was speaking and looking toward the light, he saw a brown head with two round eyes look in at him, and then a great creature that he thought must surely be a dog ran in toward him. How frightened he was then! He pushed his nose in among his blind brothers and sisters and tried to hide himself among them. He thought something dreadful was about to happen."
"""I wish Mamma Rabbit would come,"" he squeaked, shutting his eyes as closely as he could. ""I wish Mamma Rabbit would come."""
"""Why, here I am,"" she answered. ""What are you afraid of?"""
"The biggest little Rabbit opened his eyes, and there was the creature who had frightened him so, and it was his own mother! You can imagine how glad she was to see that one of her children had his eyes open."
"""I will call in some of my Rabbit friends,"" she said, ""and let you see them, if you will promise not to be afraid."""
"The next day four of the other little Rabbits had their eyes open, and the day after that they all could see each other and the shining piece of sky at the end of the burrow. It was not so very long afterward that the Rabbit family went out to dine in the forest, and this was the first time that the children had seen their father. Often when their mother left them alone in the burrow she had pulled grass and leaves over the opening to hide it from him, for Rabbit fathers do not love their children until they are old enough to go out into the great world, and it would never do for them to know where their babies are kept. Then their father taught them how to gnaw tough bark to wear their teeth down, for Rabbits' teeth grow all the time, and if they were to eat only soft food, their teeth would get too long. He taught them, too, how to move their ears in the right way for keen hearing, and told them that when chased they must run for the burrow or the nearest thicket. ""Then crouch down on some leaves that are the color of your fur,"" he said, ""and you may not be seen at all."""
"""Why should we run?"" said the biggest little Rabbit."
"""Because you might be caught if you didn't."""
"""What might catch us?"" asked the biggest little Rabbit."
"""Oh, a Hawk, perhaps, or a Weasel."""
"""What does a Hawk look like?"""
"""Like a great bird floating in the sky,"" said Papa Rabbit. ""Now, don't ask me a single question more."""
"""Does a Hawk look like that bird above us?"" asked the biggest little Rabbit."
"His father gave one look upward. ""Yes!"" he said. ""Run!"""
"And just as the Hawk swooped down toward the ground, he saw nine white-tipped tails disappear into a burrow near by."
THE LITTLE BAT WHO WOULDN'T GO TO BED
"""Come,"" said Mamma Bat, flying toward her home in the cave, ""it is time that you children went to bed. The eastern sky is growing bright, and I can see the fleecy clouds blush rosy red as the sun looks at them."""
"When Mr. Red Squirrel first came to the forest, he knew nothing of the way in which they do, and he afterward said that learning forest manners was even harder than running away from his old home. You see, Mr. Red Squirrel was born in the forest, but was carried away from there when he was only a baby. From that time until he was grown, he had never set claw upon a tree, and all he could see of the world he had seen by peeping through the bars of a cage. His cousins in the forest learned to frisk along the fence-tops and to jump from one swaying branch to another, but when this poor little fellow longed for a scamper he could only run around and around in a wire wheel that hummed as it turned, and this made him very dizzy."
"He used to wonder if there were nothing better in life, for he had been taken from his woodland home when he was too young to remember about it."
"One day he saw another Squirrel outside, a dainty little one who looked as though she had never a sad thought. That made him care more than ever to be free, and when he curled down in his cotton nest that night he dreamed about her, and that they were eating acorns together in a tall oak tree."
"The next day Mr. Red Squirrel pretended to be sick. He would not run in the wheel or taste the food in his cage. When his master came to look at him, he moaned pitifully and would not move one leg. His master thought that the leg was broken, and took limp little Mr. Red Squirrel in his hand to the window to see what was the matter. The window was up, and when he saw his chance, Mr. Red Squirrel leaped into the open air and was away to the forest. His poor legs were weak from living in such a small cage, but how he ran! His heart thumped wildly under the soft fur of his chest, and his breath came in quick gasps, and still he ran, leaping, scrambling, and sometimes falling, but always nearer the great green trees of his birthplace."
"At last he was safe and sat trembling on the lowest branch of a beech-tree. The forest was a new world to him and he asked many questions of a fat, old Gray Squirrel. The Gray Squirrel was one of those people who know a great deal and think that they know a great, great deal, and want others to think so too. He was so very knowing and important that, although he answered all of Mr. Red Squirrel's questions, he really did not tell him any of the things which he most wanted to know, and this is the way in which they talked:"
"""What is the name of this place?"" asked Mr. Red Squirrel."
"""This? Why this is the forest, of course,"" answered the Gray Squirrel."
"""We have no other name for it. It is possible that there are other forests in the world, but they cannot be so fine as this, so we call ours 'the forest.'"""
"""Are there pleasant neighbors here?"" asked Mr. Red Squirrel."
"""Very good, very good. My wife and I do not call on many of them, but still they are good enough people, I think."""
"""Then why don't you call?"""
"""Why? Why? Because they are not in our set. It would never do."" And the Gray Squirrel sat up very straight indeed."
"""Who is that gliding fellow on the ground below?"" asked the newcomer."
"""Is he one of your friends?"""
"""That? That is the Rattlesnake. We never speak to each other. There has always been trouble between our families."""
"""Who lives in that hollow tree yonder?"""
"""Sh, sh! That is where the Great Horned Owl has his home. He is asleep now and must not be awakened, for Squirrels and Owls cannot be friendly."""
"""Why not?"""
"""Because. It has always been so."""
"""And who is that bird just laying an egg in her nest above us?"""
"""Speak softly, please. That is the Cowbird, and it is not her nest. You will get into trouble if you talk such things aloud. She can't help it."
"She has to lay her eggs in other birds' nests, but they don't like it."""
"Mr. Red Squirrel tried very hard to find out the reason for this, but there are always some things for which no reason can be given; and there are many questions which can never be answered, even if one were to ask, ""Why? why? why?"" all day long. So Mr. Red Squirrel, being a wise little fellow, stopped asking, and thought by using his eyes and ears he would in time learn all that he needed to know. He had good eyes and keen ears, and he learned very fast without making many mistakes. He had a very happy life among the forest people, and perhaps that was one reason. He learned not to say things which made his friends feel badly, and he did not ask needless questions. And after all, you know, it would have been very foolish to ask questions which nobody could answer, and worse than foolish to ask about matters which he could find out for himself."
"It is in the forest as in the world outside. We can know that many things are, but we never know why they are."
WHY MR GREAT HORNED OWL HATCHED THE EGGS
"If the Rattlesnake is the king of the forest in the daytime, the Great Horned Owl is the king at night. Indeed, he is much the more powerful of the two, for he is king of air and earth alike and can go wherever he wishes, while the snake can only rule over those who live near the ground or who are so careless as to come to him there."
"There was but one pair of Great Horned Owls in the forest, and they lived in the deepest shade, having their great clumsy nest in the hollow of a tall tree. You might have walked past it a hundred times and never have guessed that any Owls lived there, if you did not notice the round pellets of bone and hair on the grass. They are such hungry fellows that they swallow their food with the bones in it. Then their tough little stomachs go to work, rolling all the pieces of bone and hair into balls and sending them back to be cast out of the Owls' mouths to the ground."
"The Great Horned Owl was a very large bird. His whole body was covered with brown, dull yellow, and white feathers. Even his feet and legs were covered, and all that you could see besides were his black claws and his black hooked bill. Yes, at night you could see his eyes, too, and they were wonderful great eyes that could see in the dark, but they were shut in the daytime when he was resting. His wife, who was the queen of the forest at night, looked exactly like him, only she was larger than he. And that is the way among Owls, the wife is always larger than her husband."
"Every night when the sun had gone down, the Great Horned Owl and his wife would come out of their hollow tree and sit blinking on a branch near by, waiting until it got dark enough for them to see quite plainly."
"As the light faded, the little black spots in their eyes would grow bigger and bigger, and then off they would go on their great soft, noiseless wings, hunting in the grass and among the branches for the supper which they called breakfast."
"Mrs. Owl could not be gone very long at a time, for there were two large round white eggs in the nest which must not get cold. Her husband was on the wing most of the night, and he often flew home with some tender morsel for her. He was really a kind-hearted fellow, although you could never have made the small birds think so. Sometimes his wife would sigh and tell how tired she was of sitting still, and how glad she would be when the eggs were hatched and she could go more with him. When she began to speak of that, the Great Horned Owl would get ready for another flight and go off saying: ""It is too bad. I am so sorry for you. But then, one would never have young Owlets if one didn't stick to the nest."" He was always proud of his children, and he thought himself a very good husband. Perhaps he was; still he had never taken his place on the nest while his wife went hunting."
"He had a good mind to try it. There was nobody to watch him, and he crept up the trunk of a fallen tree which leaned over against its neighbors. It was a foolish thing to do, and he knew it, but young Rabbits are too full of mischief to always be wise."
"""I will hold my hind legs very still,"" he thought, ""and flap my forelegs for wings."" With that he jumped off and came crashing down upon the dry leaves. He felt weak and dizzy, and as he picked himself up and looked around he hoped that nobody had seen him. ""It may be a great deal of fun to fly,"" he said, ""but it is no fun alighting from your flight unless you have real feather wings. It is too bumpy when you fly with your legs."""
"At this minute he heard an old Gobbler call out, and saw the flock of Turkeys coming toward him. ""Wake up! Wake up!"" he cried to the Ground Hog. But the Ground Hog never moved."
"Still the Turkeys came nearer. The Rabbit could see that the fat old ones were getting ahead of the others, and that here and there a young or weak Turkey had to drop into the river and swim, because his wings were tired. They got so near that he could see the queer little tufts of wiry feathers which the Gobblers wear hanging from their breast, and could see the swaying scarlet wattles under their beaks. He called again to the Ground Hog, and getting no answer, poked him three times with his head."
"The Ground Hog turned over, stretched, yawned, moved his jaws a few times as though he dreamed of eating fresh spring grass, and then fell asleep once more. After that the Rabbit left him alone."
"The first to alight were the Gobblers, and they began at once to strut and chatter. Next came the mother Turkeys and their young, and last of all came the weak ones who swam across. It was a fine sight to see them come in. The swimmers spread their tails, folded their wings tightly, stretched their necks, and struck out swiftly and strongly with their feet."
"The young Rabbit could hear a group of mothers talking together. ""The Gobblers are growing quite fond of the children,"" said one."
"""Yes,"" said another; ""my husband told me yesterday that he was very proud of our little ones."""
"""Well, it is the season for them to begin to walk together,"" said the first speaker; ""but I never in my life had such a time as I had this spring. I thought my husband would break every egg I laid."""
"""I had a hard time too,"" said the other. ""None of my eggs were broken, but after my chicks were hatched I had to hurry them out of their father's sight a dozen times a day."""
"""It is very trying,"" said a third mother Turkey with a sigh; ""but that is always the way with the Gobblers. I suppose the dear fellows can't help it;"" and she looked lovingly over at her husband as he strutted around with his friends. You would not have believed if you had seen her fond looks, and heard her husband's tender ""Gobble,"" that they had hardly spoken to each other all summer. To be sure, it was not now as it had been in the springtime. Then he would have beaten any other Gobbler who came near her, he loved her so; still, the Rabbit could see as he watched them that when he found some very large and fine acorns, this Gobbler would not eat them all, but called his wife to come and share with him; and he knew that they were happy together in their own Turkey way of being happy."
At this minute the Ground Hog opened his eyes and staggered to his feet.
"The loud talking had awakened him. He did not look very dignified just now. His fur was rumpled, and he blinked often from sleepiness. There was a dry leaf caught on one of his ears, too, that made him look very odd. The Rabbit wanted to laugh, but he did not dare to do so. The Ground Hog walked toward the Gobblers, and raised himself on his haunches."
"""Good-evening, good-evening,"" said he (it was really morning, you know). ""We are very glad to welcome you to the forest. Make yourselves perfectly at home. The grass is not so tender as it was a while ago, yet I think that you will find good feeding,"" and he waved his paws politely."
"""Thank-you, thank-you!"" answered the Gobblers, while the mothers and young Turkeys came crowding up to look at the Ground Hog. ""We came for the acorns and nuts. We shall certainly enjoy ourselves."""
"""That is right,"" said the Ground Hog heartily. ""We have a very fine forest here. You will pardon me for remarking it. The Pond People have a saying that is very true: 'It's a mighty poor Frog that won't croak for his own puddle.' And my grandfather used to say that if a Ground Hog didn't love his own home he was a very poor Hog indeed. Good-night, my friends, good-night."" And he trotted happily away, followed by the Rabbit."
"When he was gone, the Turkeys said: ""How very kind of him!"" and ""What fine manners!"" And the young Rabbit thought to himself: ""It is queer. He was sleepy and his fur was rumpled, and that leaf bobbed around his ear when he talked. He said 'evening' instead of 'morning,' and spoke as though Turkeys came here to eat grass. And yet they all liked him, and were pleased by what he said."""
You see the young Rabbit had not yet learned that the power of fine manners is more than that of looks; and that people could not think of the Ground Hog's mistakes in speaking because they knew his kindness of heart.
THE TRAVELLERS GO SOUTH
"One night a maple tree, the very one under which Mr. Red Squirrel sat when he first came to the forest, dreamed of her winter resting-time, and when she awakened early in the morning she found that her leaves were turning yellow. They were not all brightly colored, but on each was an edging, or a tip, or a splash of gold. You may be sure that the Forest People noticed it at once."
"""I told you so,"" chirruped a Robin to her mate. ""The Orioles went long ago, and the Bobolinks start to-day. We must think about our trip to the South."" When she said this, she hopped restlessly from twig to twig with an air of being exceedingly busy."
"Her husband did not answer, but began to arrange his new coat of feathers. Perhaps he was used to her fussy ways and thought it just as well to keep still. He knew that none of the Robins would start South until the weather became much colder, and he did not think it necessary to talk about it yet. Perhaps, too, Mr. Robin was a trifle contrary and was all the more slow and quiet because his wife was uneasy. In that case one could hardly blame her for talking over the family plans with the neighbors."
"Later in the day, a Bobolink came up from the marsh to say good-by. He had on his travelling suit of striped brown, and you would never have known him for the same gay fellow who during the spring and early summer wore black and buff and sang so heartily and sweetly. Now he did not sing at all, and slipped silently from bush to bush, only speaking when he had to. He was a good fellow and everyone disliked to have him go."
"Mrs. Cowbird came up while they were talking. Now that she did not care to lay any more eggs, the other birds were quite friendly with her. They began to talk over the summer that was past, and said how finely the young birds were coming on. ""By the way,"" said she, in the most careless manner possible, ""I ought to have a few children round here somewhere."
"Can anybody tell me where they are?"""
"Mrs. Goldfinch looked at her husband and he looked at the sky. The Warblers and the Vireos, who had known about the strange egg in the Goldfinches' nest, had already left for the winter, and there seemed to be no use in telling their secret now or quarrelling over what was past."
"Some of the other birds might have told Mrs. Cowbird a few things, but they also kept still."
"""It is a shame,"" she said. ""I never laid a finer lot of eggs in my life, and I was very careful where I put them. I wish I knew how many there were, but I forgot to count. I have been watching and watching for my little birds to join our flock; I was sure I should know them if I saw them. Mothers have such fine feelings, you know, in regard to their children."" (As though she had any right to say that!)"
"The Mourning Doves were there with their young son and daughter, and you could see by looking at them that they were an affectionate family. ""We shall be the last to go South,"" they cooed. ""We always mean to come North in the very early spring and stay as late as possible. This year we came much later than usual, but it could not be helped."" They had spoken so before, and rather sadly. It was said that they could tell a sorrowful story if they would; but they did not wish to sadden others by it, and bore their troubles together bravely and lovingly."
"""How do the new feathers work?"" asked a Crow, flying up at this minute and looking blacker than ever in his fall coat. Then all the birds began to talk about dress. As soon as their broods were raised, you know, their feathers had begun to drop out, and they had kept on moulting until all of the old ones were gone and the new ones on. When birds are moulting they never feel well, and when it is over they are both happy and proud."
"""I changed later than usual this year,"" said the Crow, ""and I feel that I have the very latest fashions."" This was a joke which he must have picked up among the Barnyard People, and nobody knows where they got it. Fashions never change in the Forest."
"So the lad did that; but in spite of all the pains he took, he still spilt one drop on the horse's flank. So it became a great deep lake; and because of that one drop, the horse found himself far out in it, but still he swam safe to land. But when the Trolls came to the lake, they lay down to drink it dry; and so they swilled and swilled till they burst."
"""Now we're rid of them,"" said the Horse."
"So when they had gone a long, long while, they came to a green patch in a wood."
"""Now, strip off all your arms,"" said the Horse, ""and only put on your ragged clothes, and take the saddle off me, and let me loose, and hang all my clothing and your arms up inside that great hollow lime-tree yonder. Then make yourself a wig of fir-moss, and go up to the king's palace, which lies close here, and ask for a place."
"Whenever you need me, only come here and shake the bridle, and I'll come to you."""
"Yes! the lad did all his Horse told him, and as soon as ever he put on the wig of moss he became so ugly, and pale, and miserable to look at, no one would have known him again. Then he went up to the king's palace and begged first for leave to be in the kitchen, and bring in wood and water for the cook, but then the kitchen-maid asked him:"
"""Why do you wear that ugly wig? Off with it. I won't have such a fright in here."""
"""No, I can't do that,"" said the lad; ""for I'm not quite right in my head."""
"""Do you think then I'll have you in here about the food,"" cried the cook. ""Away with you to the coachman; you're best fit to go and clean the stable."""
"But when the coachman begged him to take his wig off, he got the same answer, and he wouldn't have him either."
"""You'd best go down to the gardener,"" said he; ""you're best fit to go about and dig in the garden."""
"So he got leave to be with the gardener, but none of the other servants would sleep with him, and so he had to sleep by himself under the steps of the summer-house. It stood upon beams, and had a high staircase. Under that he got some turf for his bed, and there he lay as well as he could."
"So, when he had been some time at the palace, it happened one morning, just as the sun rose, that the lad had taken off his wig, and stood and washed himself, and then he was so handsome, it was a joy to look at him."
"So the Princess saw from her window the lovely gardener's boy, and thought she had never seen any one so handsome. Then she asked the gardener why he lay out there under the steps."
"""Oh,"" said the gardener, ""none of his fellow-servants will sleep with him; that's why."""
"""Let him come up to-night, and lie at the door inside my bedroom, and then they'll not refuse to sleep with him any more,"" said the Princess."
So the gardener told that to the lad.
"""Do you think I'll do any such thing?"" said the lad. ""Why they'd say next there was something between me and the Princess."""
"""Yes,"" said the gardener, ""you've good reason to fear any such thing, you who are so handsome."""
"""Well, well,"" said the lad, ""since it's her will, I suppose I must go."""
"So, when he was to go up the steps in the evening, he tramped and stamped so on the way, that they had to beg him to tread softly lest the King should come to know it. So he came into the Princess' bedroom, lay down, and began to snore at once. Then the Princess said to her maid:"
"""Go gently, and just pull his wig off;"" and she went up to him."
"But just as she was going to whisk it off, he caught hold of it with both hands, and said she should never have it. After that he lay down again, and began to snore. Then the Princess gave her maid a wink, and this time she whisked off the wig; and there lay the lad so lovely, and white and red, just as the Princess had seen him in the morning sun."
After that the lad slept every night in the Princess' bedroom.
"But it wasn't long before the King came to hear how the gardener's lad slept every night in the Princess' bedroom; and he got so wroth he almost took the lad's life. He didn't do that, however, but he threw him into the prison tower; and as for his daughter, he shut her up in her own room, whence she never got leave to stir day or night."
"All that she begged, and all that she prayed, for the lad and herself, was no good. The King was only more wroth than ever."
"Some time after came a war and uproar in the land, and the King had to take up arms against another king who wished to take the kingdom from him. So when the lad heard that, he begged the gaoler to go to the King and ask for a coat of mail and a sword, and for leave to go to the war. All the rest laughed when the gaoler told his errand, and begged the King to let him have an old worn-out suit, that they might have the fun of seeing such a wretch in battle. So he got that, and an old broken-down hack besides, which went upon three legs, and dragged the fourth after it."
"Then they went out to meet the foe; but they hadn't got far from the palace before the lad got stuck fast in a bog with his hack. There he sat and dug his spurs in, and cried, ""Gee up! gee up!"" to his hack."
"And all the rest had their fun out of this, and laughed, and made game of the lad as they rode past him. But they were scarcely gone, before he ran to the lime-tree, threw on his coat of mail, and shook the bridle, and there came the Horse in a trice, and said: ""Do now your best, and I'll do mine."""
"But when the lad came up the battle had begun, and the King was in a sad pinch; but no sooner had the lad rushed into the thick of it than the foe was beaten back, and put to flight. The King and his men wondered and wondered who it could be who had come to help them, but none of them got so near him as to be able to talk to him, and as soon as the fight was over he was gone. When they went back, there sat the lad still in the bog, and dug his spurs into his three-legged hack, and they all laughed again."

AT FONTAINEBLEAU.
"IT was a day of sun and rain,"
Uncertain as a child’s quick moods;
And I shall never pass again
So blithe a day among the woods.
"The forest knew you and was glad,"
And laughed for very joy to know
"Her child was with her; then, grown sad,"
"She wept, because her child must go."
And you would spy and you would capture
The shyest flower that lit the grass:
The joy I had to watch your rapture
Was keen as even your rapture was.
"The forest knew you and was glad,"
And laughed and wept for joy and woe.
This was the welcome that you had
Among the woods of Fontainebleau.
ON THE HEATH.
HER face’s wilful flash and glow
Turned all its light upon my face
night
As a stone that falls in a sounding well;
"Under us the Seine flows through dark and light,"
While the beat of time—hark!—is audible.
"Lights on bank and bridge glitter gold and red,"
Lights upon the stream glitter red and white;
"Under us the night, and the night overhead."
"We together, we alone together in the night."
“I DREAM OF HER.”
"I DREAM of her the whole night long,"
The pillows with my tears are wet.
"I wake, I seek amid the throng"
The courage to forget.
"Yet still, as night comes round, I dread,"
"With unavailing fears,"
"The dawn that finds, beneath my head,"
The pillows wet with tears.
TEARS.
"When you were here, I sometimes tired,"
"Ah me! that you so loved me, dear."
"Now, in these weary days desired,"
You are no longer here.
"When you were here, did either know"
"That each so loved the other, dear?"
But that was long and long ago:
You are no longer here.
APRIL MIDNIGHT.
"SIDE by side through the streets at midnight,"
"Roaming together,"
"Through the tumultuous night of London,"
In the miraculous April weather.
"Roaming together under the gaslight,"
"Day’s work over,"
"How the Spring calls to us, here in the city,"
Calls to the heart from the heart of a lover!
"Cool the wind blows, fresh in our faces,"
"Cleansing, entrancing,"
"After the heat and the fumes and the footlights,"
Where you dance and I watch your dancing.
"Good it is to be here together,"
"""I've found a certain part of those brains developed in a peculiar"

"Frank Corson entered the office of Wilson Maynard, Superintendent of"
Park Hill Hospital. Maynard looked out over the tops of his
"old-fashioned pince-nez glasses and said, ""Oh, Doctor Corson. You phoned"
"for a chat."""
It was the rather pompous superintendent's way of saying he was happy to
give Frank Corson a little time. He considered all the doctors and
"nurses at Park Hill his ""boys and girls,"" and he did the ""father"" bit"
very well.
"""Yes, I--"""

"Rance dealt the cards. Before either looked at them, he glanced across"
"at the Girl and asked scornfully, perhaps enviously:"
"""What do you see in him?"""
"""What do you see in me?"" she flashed back instantly, as she picked up"
"her cards; and then: ""What have you got?"""
"""King high,"" declared the gambler."
"""King high here,"" echoed the Girl."
"""Jack next,"" and he showed his hand."
"""Queen next,"" and the Girl showed hers."
"""You've got it,"" conceded the gambler, easily. Then, in another tone,"
"""but you're making a mistake--"""
"""If I am, it's my mistake! Cut!"""
"Rance cut the cards. The Girl dealt them steadily. Then,"
"GEORGE.  I tell you plainly, as a man of the world, I don't believe"
"in the guide, philosopher and friend business."
CLARE.  Thank you.
A silence.  CLARE suddenly clasps her hands behind her head.
CLARE.  Let me go!  You'd be much happier with any other woman.
GEORGE.  Clare!
CLARE.  I believe--I'm sure I could earn my living.  Quite serious.
GEORGE.  Are you mad?
CLARE.  It has been done.
Moulton was a handsome man of past fifty with a youthful face against
"his iron gray hair and mustache, well dressed, genial, a man who seemed"
keenly in love with the good things of life.
"“It is rumored,” began Kennedy, “that an attempt was made on your safe"
here at the office last night.”
"“Yes,” he admitted, taking off his glasses and polishing them"
"carefully. “I suppose there is no need of concealment, especially as I"
hear that a somewhat similar attempt was made on the safe of my friend
Herman Schloss in Maiden Lane.”
“You lost nothing?”
Moulton put his glasses on and looked Kennedy in the face frankly.
"There was the upflashing of a sword, and a hoarse challenge frightened"
the night.
Giovanni Frangipani saw a furious face glaring dead white from under
the shadow of a shield.
"He stopped in his onward rush, blinked at the duke as one gone mad."
"""Damnation, what have we here?"""
"""By the love of God, I have you now!"""
"""Fool, are you mad?"""
"The hoarse voice echoed him, the eyes flashed fire."
"""Guard, ravisher,--guard!"""
"""Ten thousand devils! Who are you?"""
"""Your obedient servant,--the Duke of Spoleto!"""
The Frangipani growled like a trapped bear.
"He raised his sword, put forward his shield."
"""On with you, dog!"" he roared. ""Join your wanton under the sod!"""
"""Ha, say you so?"" cried the duke, closing in."
"Their swords flashed, yelped, twisted in the air. A down cut hewed the"
dexter cantrel from the Frangipani's shield. His face with a gashed
manner that he was different from the others.
“You are Jack Bosworth?” he asked.
"“That’s my name,” replied the boy."
“You are here on a mission for your father?”
“I am here on a hunting trip.”
"“With business on the side, eh?”"
"“No business at all,” replied Jack."
“We know better than that!” the stranger answered.
“What do you want of us?” asked Jack.
"“We want information now in your possession,” answered the fellow,"
looking Jack sharply in the eyes.
“What kind of information?”
“We want to know where certain documents are.”
"“You’ll have to ask some one else, then.”"
“We are certain that you have the information we require.”
"“If I had,” Jack answered, “you never would get it from me.”"
"“You will gain nothing by being obstinate,” the fellow said. “Remember"
"""Good Lord!"" moaned the Superintendent, ""and what's your salary?"""
The sergeant's good-humour was impregnable.
"""Give me time,"" he said, and the sentence was almost drowned in a loud"
knock at the door. An instant later Kilshaw rushed in.
"""What's this, Dawson?"" he cried to the Superintendent; ""what's this"
"about the murder?"""
"""You haven't heard, sir?"""
"""I went out of town to avoid this infernal row to-day, and am only just"
"back."""
Dawson smiled discreetly. He could understand that the proceedings of
the day would not attract Mr. Kilshaw.
"""But is it true,"" Kilshaw went on eagerly, ""that Mr. Benham has been"
"murdered?"""
"""Well, it looks like it, sir,"" and Dawson gave a full account of the"
circumstances.
"""And the motive?"" asked Kilshaw."
"""Robbery, I suppose. His pockets were empty, and according to our"
"information he was generally flush of money; where he got it, I don't"
"know."""
"""Ah!"" said Kilshaw meditatively; ""his pockets empty! And have you no"

"Ffolliott espying the two newly-arrived ladies across the room, made"
his way to them:
"“Do you know, Miss Foljambe Pfinch,” he said--“I feel such an ass; they"
told me it was a--fancy--dress--affair.”
The lorgnettes were turned upon him:
"“It’s that ridiculous Mr. Ffolliott,” said she; and laughed"
immoderately.
"Ffolliott sighed, and turned away:"
"“Everybody seems to think I am an ass to-night,” he said wearily. “Oh,"
there’s Fosse. I don’t like Fosse--but I’ll talk to _him_. No--he’s
"talking to another man. I think I’ll go home. No, I won’t, I’ll sit"
down.”
He sat down.
"“Every fellow does something idiotic in his life,” he said."
He watched Fosse button-hole Gomme; and he saw Gomme’s lips smile
"amusedly as he gazed at the floor, listening to him."
He bent all his attention to hear what passed between the two.
"“Now, you know, Mr. Gomme,” said the fussy little man--“in"
"before."""
"""No high words passed between you?"""
"""None."""
"""And nothing that you told her caused her any sudden grief?  Are you"
"quite certain of this?"" he asked, looking at me very fixedly through his"
glasses.
"""I made one observation which certainly caused her surprise,"" I"
"admitted.  ""Nothing else."""
"""Was it only surprise?"" he asked very calmly."
"""Surprise mingled with fear."""
"""Ah!"" he ejaculated, as though obtaining some intelligence by this"
"admission of mine.  ""And may I not know the nature of the information"
"you gave her?"""
"""No, Dick,"" I responded.  ""It is a secret--her secret."""
He was silent.
"""You refuse to tell me?"" he said disappointedly."
"""I am unable,"" I replied."
"""And if I judge rightly, it is this secret which has parted you?"""
"""No, it is not,"" I answered.  ""That's the most curious part of the whole"
"""Wait, they're after me, Captain; it's the Port Townsend police, and if"
"you let them aboard they'll take me off."""
"""What makes you think so?"" demanded Peasley."
"""Ask them."""
"Turning, the skipper bellowed down the gleaming electric pathway, ""Who"
"are you?"""
"""Police! We want to come aboard."""
"""What did I tell you?"" cried Emerson."
"Once more the Captain shouted: ""What do you want?"""
"""One of your passengers--Emerson. Heave to. You're passing us."""
"""That's bloody hard luck, Mr. Emerson; I can't help myself,"" the"
Captain declared. But again Boyd blocked him as he started for the
telegraph.
"""I won't stand it, sir. It's a conspiracy to ruin me."""
"""But, my dear young man--"""
"""Don't touch that instrument!"""
"From the launch came cries of growing vehemence, and a startled murmur"
of voices rose from somewhere in the darkness of the deck beneath.
The spectral custodian had refilled the tankards with amber liquid.
Thereof the Abbot sipped understandingly.
"""Lacrymae Christi,"" he turned to the duke. ""Vestrae salubritati bibo!"""
The duke raised his goblet.
"""Waes Hael!"" and he drained its contents with a huge gulp."
"""I would chant twenty psalms for that beverage,"" he mused after a"
while.
"The Abbot suggested ""Attendite Populi!""--""It is one of the longest,"""
"he said, with meaning."
"""Don't trifle with a thirsty belly,"" growled the duke. ""In these"
"troublous times it behooves men to be circumspect!"""
"""Probatum est,"" said the Abbot. ""It is a noble vocation! Jubilate"
"Deo!"""
And he raised his goblet.
The Duke of Spoleto laid a heavy hand upon his arm.
"""It is a Vigil of the Church!"""
The Abbot gave himself absolution on account of the great company.
"""There's no fast on the drink!"" he said with meaning. ""Nor is there"
"better wine between here and Salamanca!"""
Something in his tones brought to his hostess one of those swift fits of
repentance that were apt to wait for her whenever she allowed herself to
treat this visitor with friendliness. He was so very prompt in
responding!
"""She is not very well,"" she answered, rather coldly."
"""I--I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing her?"""
Mr. Coxon's wishes were fulfilled to the moment. The door opened and
Alicia came in. On seeing him she stopped.
"""Come in, Alicia,"" said Lady Eynesford. ""Here's Mr. Coxon come to be"
"congratulated."""
Coxon stood up with a propitiatory smile.
"""How do you do, Mr. Coxon?"" said Alicia, giving him a limp hand. ""Shall"
"I ring for tea, Mary?"""
"""They'll bring it. You haven't wished him joy."""
"""Oh, are you in the new Ministry?"""
"""I have that honour, Miss Derosne. I hope you are on our side?"""
"""I don't quite know which side you are on--now,"" observed Alicia, in"
slow but distinct tones.
Coxon grew red.
energy enough to create more than the delicate measure of a gust of
chamber-music.
A burst of applause followed the recital of a poem.
Noll roused with a start:
"“Come, Madelaine,” said he--“this heavy air is making you faint. Come"
with me and we’ll have some supper.”
She gathered her skirts with wonted grace of gesture and took his arm;
and they made their way out of the room almost unnoticed.
"As the doors closed on them, she turned in the dim ill-lit passage,"
"drew down his face to her between her two hands, and kissed him."
She clung to him:
"“Thou must give me a bed too,” she whispered hoarsely; “I have no bed.”"
She was trembling.
"“You are tired, Madelaine,” he said."
She nodded:
“I have had no sleep for three nights.”
“What have you been doing?” he asked.
"“I walked about the streets,” she answered simply."
“Coleman. He lives—”
“I know. Au revoir!” And the girls were alone.
"“There!” exclaimed Miss Decker, “we have got rid of him. Now for the"
"others. You slip upstairs, and I’ll dispose of them one by one. You are"
taken suddenly ill. Teddy will not be back for an hour. Dr. Coleman has
moved.”

"A lamp burned in the sea-room, and the two girls were sitting in their"
evening gowns before a bright log fire. Miss Decker was in white this
time—an elaborate French concoction of embroidered muslin which made
her look like an expensive fashion plate. Jessica wore a low-cut black
"crêpe, above which she rose like carved ivory and brass. The snakes"
to-night were held in place by diamond hair-pins that glittered like
baleful eyes. In her lap sparkled four rings.
"“What shall I do?” she exclaimed. “If my life depended upon it, I could"
“Well?”
“Does it not seem odd to you?”
"“Not at all. A relation of her first husband’s, I suppose. In fact"
Yvonne said as much.”
"“I could not help being struck by the name, Everard. It is so peculiar."
I remembered it from the publication of the banns.”
"“I compliment you on your memory, Emmeline,” said the Canon."
"Mrs. Winstanley drew herself up, offended."
"She walked from the window where they were standing to a table, and"
fetched from it a newspaper.
“Do you remember the Christian name of Yvonne’s first husband?”
"The Canon drew himself up too, and frowned."
"“What is the meaning of all this, Emmeline? What are you trying to"
insinuate?”
"“If I thought you were going to adopt this tone, Everard, I should have"
kept my suspicions to myself.”
"“I certainly wish that you had,” said he, growing angry. “It is an"
insult to Yvonne which I cannot permit. My wife is above suspicion.”
"“Like Caesar’s,” said the lady with a curl of the lip. “Do you know that"
passing reference to yesterday's tragedy.
"""I didn't like him at all,"" she said; ""but still it's dreadful--a man"
"one knew ever so slightly!"""
"Alicia agreed, and the next instant she found herself practically alone"
with Medland; for Daisy ran off to pick a wild-flower that caught her
"eye in the wood, and Norburn followed her. Not knowing whether to be"
"glad or sorry, she made no effort to escape, and was silent while"
Medland began to speak of his prospects in that evening's division.
Suddenly she paused in her walk and lifted her eyes to his.
"""You look happier,"" she said."
Medland's conscience smote him: he was looking happier because the man
was dead.
"""It's at the prospect of being a free man to-morrow,"" he answered, with"
"a smile. ""You know, Cincinnatus was very happy."""
"""But you're not like that."""
"""No, I suppose not. Say it's----"""
"""Never mind."""
After a pause she made another attempt.
"""Mr. Medland!"""
"""Yes?"""
"Quilliam O’Flaherty stooping down in confusion to search for the hat,"
she kicked him violently behind.
"There was a roar of laughter from the students seated round about, and"
"they tapped the handles of their knives upon the tables, singing:"
"“Opera-bouffe, bouffe, bouffe! Opera-bouffe, bouffe, bouffe!"
Hey-hey-hey! bouffe-bouffe-bouffe!”
"Then the girl flogged Quilliam with a horse-whip, thrice:"
Once for France.
Once for womanhood.
And once because she liked it.
The whip whistled.
It was said that he had been seen to strike at her--but she parried the
"blow with her left, and countered between his eyes with the butt-end of"
the whip--which was loaded.
He fell.
It was homeric.
"It was at this stage, so the scandal went, that he scrambled under a"
table; but she lugged at his collar to get him out; and as he clung
to the leg of the table she gripped him by the moustache so that she
pulled off one side of it.
"and a little below the forty-five latitude ring?"""
"""Yes."""
It was a small round disc no more than an inch in diameter.
"""We think that may be a response."""
"Wilson said, ""You mean a target? Possibly one of the lifeships?"""
"""Yes."""
"""I'll have a scooter go out and see. What's its spacial position?"""
"The tech took another look. ""I'd say eighty-one plus longitude and"
"forty-three latitude."""
"""From what?"" demanded Wilson."
"""From ship's axis, sir."""
"""Distance?"""
"""Oh, about half a parsec."""
"Wilson groaned. ""Haven't you determined any spacial attitude?"""
"""Attitude, sir?"""
"""The angle of the ship's axis with respect to the stellar positions."
So you've a blotch out there at half a parsec. It's an inch or so in
diameter. Have one of your juniors run off some trig on the calculator

"“Yes. Our gardener’s son has joined a circus too. Such an amusin’ boy,"
he was.”
"“It brings it all so home to one, doesn’t it!”"
"“Doesn’t it, indeed! But I confess I have always been fascinated by the"
stage. There’s somethin’ so very romantic about livin’ in green-rooms
"and paintin’ your face, and--pretendin’ to be someone else.”"
The other whispered in her ear.
"The lorgnettes were flicked open again, and glittered upon Sir Gilders"
Persimmon.
“Indeed! But he is so very old--and she--but there is such a difference
of social rank between a baronet’s wife and a mere painter--surely!
"Still, he _is_ very old. Almost permissible sin, Gerty.”"
They both tittered.
"“My dear,” said the other, “you are really quite naughty.”"
"Sir Gilders pounced upon Fosse, whom he had followed round the room,"
"put up a hand to aid his dull hearing, and said:"
“You were speaking of dotage----”
Fosse winced uneasily:
"“No, sir,” he shrieked--“I was _not_ talking of dotage. I say that the"
withering contempt.
"""I don't know Latin,"" said the poor second mate."
"""And who expected it of you?"" asked the skipper.  ""It means that"

"to tell 'em it will be considered an unfriendly hact, and that we 'as"

"""First rate!"" said the crew.  ""That'll give 'em the jumps."""
"""And how am I to translate it?"" asked the miserable Simcox."
"""That's your look-out,"" said the Guffin, with a hiccup.  ""Shall I"
"keep a dog and bark myself?  Now, 'urry and get it hover.  And let"
"hevery one 'ave a weapon, 'andspikes and belayin' pins.  Now go,"
"Simcox!"""
"""Hart, come along with me,"" said Simcox."
"And as the ""old man"" was engaged in keeping his balance, he made no"
objection.
"""Exactly. Now read this,"" and he gave him the copy of a certificate of"
marriage between George Benyon and Margaret Aspland.
"""Quite so,"" nodded Kilshaw."
"""And this."""
"Kilshaw took the slip of newspaper, old and yellow. It contained a few"
"lines, briefly recording that Mrs. Benyon had left her home secretly by"
"night, in her husband's absence, and could not be found."
Kilshaw nodded again.
"""It doesn't surprise me,"" he said. ""I knew all this. I was in Mr."
"Benyon's confidence."""
"""Perhaps you can tell us how he lived?"" hazarded the Superintendent,"
with a shrewd look.
Mr. Kilshaw looked doubtful.
"""The inquest is fixed for to-morrow. The more we know now, the less it"
"will be necessary to protract it."""
"""I have been helping him lately,"" admitted Kilshaw; and he added, ""Look"
"here, Superintendent, I don't want that more talked about than"
"necessary."""
"""You needn't say a word to me now unless you like, sir; but I only want"
"to make things as comfortable as I can. You see, the coroner is bound to"
"look into it a bit. Had you given him money lately?"""
"happened here, and we want your assistance."""
"In an instant he became grave, for I suppose my tone showed him that I"
was in no humour for joking.
"""What's the nature of the affair?"" he asked."
"""Death,"" I replied seriously.  ""A lady here--a friend of mine--has died"
"mysteriously."""
"""A mystery--eh?"" he exclaimed, instantly interested.  ""Tell me about"
"it."""
"""This place,"" I replied, ""belongs to the Countess de Foville, a lady"
"whom I knew well when I was at the Brussels Embassy, and it is her"
"daughter Yolande who has been found dead in this room this evening."""
"""Yolande de Foville!"" he repeated, with knit brows.  ""She was a friend"
"of yours once, if I mistake not?"" he added, looking me straight in the"
face.
"""Yes, Dick, she was,"" I responded.  ""I told you of her long ago."""
"""You loved her once?"""
"""Yes,"" I answered with difficulty, ""I loved her once."""
"""And how did the unfortunate affair occur?"" he asked, folding his arms"
"and leaning back against a chair.  ""Tell me the whole story."""

to them the story of the discovery. The watchmaker listened with
interest.
"""Benham!"" he remarked. ""I never heard the name, did you?"""
"""You know him, Ned,"" said the doorkeeper's wife; ""him as Mr. Gaspard"

Later that afternoon we returned with the lawyer on the stretcher. Solem

"He was speechless, for the first time."
The Russian bankers in the room were taken totally by surprise. Double-
"dealing KGB games had always been part of the landscape, but this was"
confusing in the extreme. Whose money was it anyway?
"""Michael."" Novosty's voice was trembling. ""This cannot be allowed to"
"happen."""
"""I agree. We've definitely got a situation here."""
He glanced around to see the four _Mino-gumi kobun _poised in the
"doorway, all with H&K automatics now out of their briefcases. Kenji"
"Nogami was standing behind them, his eyes defeated."
Novosty still looked stunned. The range of options was rapidly
narrowing to none.
"Vera indicated his Ruger. ""You would be wise to put that away. Now."""
"""If they take these securities, my life's not worth a _kopeck_."""
"Novosty seemed to be thinking out loud. ""What does it matter."""
It wasn't a question. It was a statement.
"Remembering it all later, Vance could barely recall the precise"
sequence of events. He did remember shoving Eva back against the wall
as the fireworks began.
Novosty's first round caught the lead _Mino-gumi kobun_ squarely
"“Are you sure he did it?” asked Kennedy, more, I felt, for its moral"
effect on her than through any doubt in his own mind.
"“Not sure. But then the wall safe shows no marks, and the replica is"
gone.”
“Might I see your jewel case?” he asked.
“Surely. I’ll get it. The wall safe is in Lynn’s room. I shall probably
have to fuss a long time with the combination.”
In fact she could not have been very familiar with it for it took
"several minutes before she returned. Meanwhile, Kennedy, who had been"
"drumming absently on the arms of his chair, suddenly rose and walked"
quietly over to a scrap basket that stood beside an escritoire. It had
"evidently just been emptied, for the rooms must have been cleaned"
several hours before. He bent down over it and picked up two scraps of
paper adhering to the wicker work. The rest had evidently been thrown
away.
I bent over to read them. One was:

The other read:

would send him word. In respect to giving him letters of introduction to
"influential persons in Spain, he had no objection."
They took leave of the abbé.
"“All this has to go slowly,” said Kennedy."
“Of course. One cannot insist that it should happen all at once.”
_BERNINI_
"“If you have nothing to do, let’s take a walk,” said the Englishman."
“If you like.”
“Have you noticed the fountains in this square?”
“No.”
“They are worth looking at.”
Cæsar contemplated the central obelisk. It is set on top of a rock
"hollowed out like a cavern, in the mouth of which a lion is seen."
Afterwards they looked at the fountains at the ends of the square.
"“The sculptures are by Bernini,” explained Kennedy. “Bernini belonged to"
"an epoch that has been very much abused by the critics, but nowadays he"
is much praised. He enchants me.”
"“It is rather a mixed style, don’t you think?”"
"""I can't."""
"""She'll be hurt, Alicia. She'll think you don't care. Come, dear."""
"""Tell her--tell her I'm coming directly. Eleanor, you must let me go,"""
and breaking away she fled into the house.
Eleanor went alone to seek Lady Eynesford. Somehow Alicia's words had
quenched her high spirits for the moment.
"""Poor child! I do hope she hasn't been foolish,"" she mused. ""Surely"
"after what Mary told her--! Oh dear, I'm afraid it isn't all as happy as"
"it is about Dick!"""
And then she indulged in some very cynical meditations on the advantages
"of being a person of shallow emotions and changeful fancies, until she"
"was roused by the sight of Medland and Norburn walking up to the house,"
to attend the Executive Council. From the window she closely watched
"the Premier as he approached; her mood wavered to and fro, but at last"
"she summed up her impressions by remarking,"
"""Well, I suppose one might."""

"""Dangerous, he says,"" Abrams muttered. ""Any idea where we might go to"
"have a little talk with him?"""
"""No, can't say that I have."""
"""Try the streets of Manhattan--is that it?"""
"""I guess that's about it."" Taber paused. ""Wait a minute. If he's looking"
for a spot to hide in he wouldn't come back here and he certainly
wouldn't try King's room. There's just a wide-open chance he might have

An hour after he'd finished delivering his speech on the floor of the
"Senate, Crane held a press conference in one of Washington's most"
"important hotels. The place was crowded. He stood on a platform, looked"
"out over a sea of heads, and pointed at an upraised hand for the first"
question.
"""Senator, have you gotten any reaction from the people of your state on"
"the revelations contained in your speech?"""
"""There has been very little time, but telegrams have been pouring in."""
"""What is the reaction?"""
He came staggering out of the cabin with a case of brandy and laid it
on the after capstan.
"""I guess I'll have a boy,"" said Jones.  ""'Ere, you scum, send me"
"Billy.""  And Billy came aft."
"""I releases you temp'ry without bail,"" said the skipper fiercely, ""so"
"puckalow that case and foller me.  No, you wait till I gets a"
"tablecloth as a signal I'm willin' to 'ave peace."""
When he came out with a cloth he went ashore and stumbled up the
"hill, followed by the boy Billy, bearing the case of brandy.  He"
"found the crew of the Frenchmen lining the crest, and heard them talk."
"""Say, Johnny French,"" said old Jones, ""if you wants war, prepare for"
"peace.  Who's the captain?"""
"""Sapristi!"" said the French captain."
Jones nodded.
"""Give it up, old son.  It warn't my fault, if relyin' on the"
discretion of ambassadors ain't a fault: and maybe you can swaller
the hultimatum with some real good brandy throwed in.  And is your
"name Sapristi?"""

dignity.

"But the citizen was talking to vacancy. He turned and saw his hearer, a"
"fast receding black shadow, flying in the direction of a house with"
three lighted upper windows.
And in the morning came along two policemen on their way to the beats
they owned. The park was deserted save for one dilapidated figure that
"sprawled, asleep, on a bench. They stopped and gazed upon it."
"“It’s Dopy Mike,” said one. “He hits the pipe every night. Park bum for"
"twenty years. On his last legs, I guess.”"
The other policeman stooped and looked at something crumpled and crisp
in the hand of the sleeper.
"“Gee!” he remarked. “He’s doped out a fifty-dollar bill, anyway. Wish I"
knew the brand of hop that he smokes.”
"And then “Rap, rap, rap!” went the club of realism against the shoe"

The Rubberneck Auto was about ready to start. The merry top-riders had
"""I rather imagine he's out here somewhere in the search group,"" she"
said.
"""He may even be directing it,"" Andrews said carefully."
One thing he knew well--never run down a rival. It always brought on
"a defensive attitude. Build the rival up, and the return might be"
sympathetic. A clever course could be traveled between build-up and
tear-down.
*       *       *       *       *
"Looking at Alice thoughtfully, Andrews got up and began to rummage"
through a few lockers. Eventually he found a blanket and brought it to
her.
"""I'm not too familiar with these life cans,"" he told her, with a"
"disarming smile. ""I hope I remain in ignorance of them. But I found"
"what I was after. Now, Miss Hemingway, if you'll stretch out, I'll tuck"
"you in, and you can get some shut-eye."""
"""That I can use,"" she said honestly."
"The blanket felt good. So did his hands, smoothing out the blanket, but"
being carefully tender and proper. Andrews was a smooth operator of
many years' experience.
Eventually she slept.
"Andrews found another cigar, and smoked it languidly, his eyes roaming"
around the metal walls of the cabin. He was thinking that he disliked
There was a titter.
“Sharles ze Foorst--risen from ze dead!” announced Rippley.
“I say”--the affected drawl discovered Ffolliott. “Rippley told me it
"was a--fancy-dress--affair,” he said plaintively. “And to come early.”"
There was a wild shout of laughter.
"Ffolliott looked round nervously at the strange faces, and recognising"
"Aubrey at last, by the mirror, he said peevishly:"
“I am exceedingly displeased with Rippley--he--he chose my dress.”
Rippley wiped the tears from his eyes:
"“Well--don’t you see we are nearly all in disguise? ... except Aubrey,"
who thinks that because he looks like an ass no one will know him.” He
"turned to the others: “I say, boys,” he added, chuckling, “things are"
beginning to move at last. This _is_ going to be a unique night.”
“Hush!”
"They had all turned to Blotte, and a strange silence fell upon the room."
"Andrew Blotte stood listening, as to some strange sounds. He roused:"
"“Ay, I sup with the gods to-night.... And I can hear the guests"
arriving--all the clever fellows that have made the world a
delight--and with them come the dear dead companions that worked with
"us, and sang with us, and drank with us--in Paris.... I know them--they"
"haven't we, Tommy?"""
"""Double it,"" Tommy laughed. ""We agreed last night that you looked like a"
"million-dollar bill to us!"""
"""Oh, my boys,"" Monsieur sputtered with embarrassment and pleasure, ""you"
"disarm my power to thank you--see, I blush!"""
"""Damned if he isn't,"" Tommy grinned at me. ""What d'you know about this"
"little gezabo, anyhow!"""
Monsieur's face grew more composed as he showed his interest in a new
word.
"""You say--gazebo?"" he asked, blandly. ""Is that not a belvedere?"""
"""Gazebo is, yes; but I said gezabo--that's you!"""
"""Your American Indian language?"""
"""Sure thing. Pure talk. If you're interested in Indians, stick around."
"Why not get the Havana police to help us hunt the kiddie?""--I had known"
that before long Tommy would be using a first personal pronoun.
"""Bah! They are of no value! But even I have small hope of finding her."
"The report was written nearly six years ago, and she has been gone"
"upwards of twenty years."""
"""So it's a she,"" Tommy looked over at me and nodded. ""Well, nearly six"
"years, and upwards of twenty, plus what she was when she left home,"
leads me to believe the lady's almost old enough to take care of
"herself!"""
He left the matron and darted back into the room.
"“I'm sure there must be something you would like me to bring you,” he"
whispered. “Don't be afraid. Any mortal thing.”
The child's lips twitched and she looked nervously from side to side.
“What is it? Tell me.”
"“Oh, sir,” she pleaded breathlessly, “might I have some peppermint"
bull's-eyes.”
"When Herold returned to his dressing-room after the first act,--the"
piece for which he had been rehearsing had started a successful
"career,--he found Risca sitting in a straight-backed chair and smoking a"
pipe.
"“Hallo, John! I did n't know you were in front. Why did n't you tell me?"
"It's going splendidly, is n't it?”"
He glowed with the actor's excited delight in an audience's enthusiastic
"reception of a new play. His glow sat rather oddly upon him, for he was"
"made up as a decrepit old man, with bald wig, and heavy, blue patches"
beneath his eyes.
"“No, I'm not in front,” said John."
"“I see now,” smiled Herold, glancing at his friend's loose tweed suit."
No clothes morning or evening ever fitted Risca. Herold called him “The
Tailors' Terror.”
"""I don't know. I'm not a spaceman, responsible for the lives of three"
"people--at a hundred clams an hour."""
"""Some day I'm going to shove those hundred fish down your throat."""
"""Do. And I'll spit 'em back at you!"""
Norton roughly took her shoulders in his hands. He twisted her to face
"him, clamped down on her soft shoulders until she turned her face up"
to complain with welling eyes. He put his lips on hers and tried to
"force some warmth into them. She submitted calmly, and when he found no"
"response and opened his eyes, she was staring at him vacantly."
Abruptly he let her go. She relaxed in the seat.
"""I'm not afraid to work,"" he said in a hollow voice."
"""Prove it,"" she replied flatly."
"He got up, left her there, and went below."

Wilson sat in the Information Center and eyed the search grid glumly.
"It stretched stereoscopically out in the room, a lot of its vacant"
"network of gleaming white lines frosted over with white shading, to"
mark where the search had covered.
"""--what?"" fell from the Girl's lips, her face pale and set."
"""Are you deaf?"" demanded Rance; and then, emphasising every word, he"
"rasped out: ""The fellow you've been polkying with is the man that has"
"been asking people to hold up their hands."""
"""Oh, go on--you can't hand me out that!"" Nevertheless the Girl looked"
wildly about the room.
Angrily Rance strode over to her and sneered bitingly:
"""You don't believe it yet, eh?"""
"""No, I don't believe it yet!"" rapped out the Girl, laying great stress"
"upon the last word. ""I know he isn't."""
"""Well, he _is_ Ramerrez, and he _did_ come to The Polka to rob it,"""
retorted the Sheriff.
All at once the note of resentment in the Girl's voice became positive;
"she flared back at him, though she flushed in spite of herself."
"""But he didn't rob it!"""
"""That's what gits me,"" fretted Sonora. ""He didn't."""
"""I should think it would git you,"" snapped back the Girl, both in her"
look and voice rebuking him for his words.
It was left to Ashby to spring another surprise.
"He returned on board the wreck of the _Potluck_, and in company with"
"a bottle of brandy strove with the situation, while the crowd and"
"their spokesman, Hart, argued like a House of Commons."

"mule's 'ind leg off.  'Hout of this,' is the on'y hargument a"

"""But they seems to be a good many more of 'em than us,"" suggested the"
crowd.
"""Come to that,"" said Hart, ""it's the on'y just ground we 'as to go"
"for 'em.  For if they was on'y ekal numbers, it'd be cowardly to"
"whack 'em, and I for one would be on the side of just goin' down"
there and shovin' them out peaceful.  I'm for the hultimatum right
"off.  I wonder 'ow the Guffin will put it.  Say, boys, 'ere 'e comes!"""
"The ""old man"" staggered up with a sheet of paper in his hand."
"""Have you done it, sir?"" asked Simcox.  ""Let's hear it."""
"""Yes, read it out,"" said Lampert, with half a sneer, which the"
skipper did not notice.
The crowd gathered round as the captain squatted on a rock.
"""On board the British barque _Potluck_, belonging to the British port"
"Liverpool; owners, McWattie & Co.; Captain Abednego Jones."
"""MR. SIMCOX,--Sir----"""
"Next instant he was sprawling on the floor, with Dex rolling"
"helplessly on top of him, while the space ship bounced up twenty"
thousand feet as though propelled by a giant sling.
*       *       *       *       *
"The peep, peep of the radio signalling stopped. The space ship rolled"
"helplessly for a moment, then resumed an even keel. Brand and Dex"
gazed at each other.
"""What the hell?"" said Dex."
"He started to get to his feet, put all his strength into the task of"
"moving his Jupiter-weighted body, and crashed against the top of the"
control room.
"""Say!"" he sputtered, rubbing his head. ""Say, what _is_ this?"""
"Brand, profiting by his mistake, rose more cautiously, shut off the"
"atomic motor, and approached a glass panel again. ""God knows what it"
"is,"" he said with a shrug. ""Somehow, with our passing into the red"
"area, the pull of gravity has been reduced by about ten, that's all."""
"""Oh, so that's all, is it? Well, what's happened to old Jupe's"
"gravity?"""
"Again Brand shrugged. ""I haven't any idea. Your guess is as good as"
"mine."""
"He peered down through the panel, and stiffened in surprise."

"Here lost and gone poor Robin lies,"
"He trembles, lingers, falls and dies."
"He's gone, he's gone, forever lost,"
No more of him they now can boast.

He struggled to the very last.

freedom. The two million commission would mean a new beginning for him.

have stored away in his vault gems running into the hundreds of
thousands of dollars.
"“Mrs. Moulton must know of this,” remarked Kennedy. “Winters, you and"
Jameson bring Muller along. I am going up to the Deluxe.”
I must say that I was surprised at finding Mrs. Moulton there. Outside
"the suite Winters and I waited with the unresisting Muller, while"
Kennedy entered. But through the door which he left ajar I could hear
what passed.
"“Mrs. Moulton,” he began, “something terrible has happened—”"
"He broke off, and I gathered that her pale face and agitated manner"
told him that she knew already.
"“Where is Mr. Moulton?” he went on, changing his question."
"“Mr. Moulton is at his office,” she answered tremulously. “He"
"telephoned while I was out that he had to work to-night. Oh, Mr."
Kennedy—he knows—he knows. I know it. He has avoided me ever since I
missed the replica from-”
“Sh!” cautioned Craig. He had risen and gone to the door.
"“Winters,” he whispered, “I want you to go down to Lynn Moulton’s"
office. Meanwhile Jameson can take care of Muller. I am going over to
that place of Stein’s presently. Bring Moulton up there. You will wait
"here, Walter, for the present,” he nodded."
He returned to the room where I could hear her crying softly.
“Will you be seated?”
"“It is only human,” said he, “to call and see you, and ask after that"
unhappy child.”
"“She is getting on,” said the Sister superintendent, frostily, “as well"
as can be expected.”
“Which means? Please tell me. I am here to know.”
"“She will take some time to recover from her injuries, and of course her"
nerve is broken.”
"“I'm afraid,” said John, “your institution can't afford many invalid's"
luxuries.”
"“None at all,” replied the weary-faced woman. “She gets proper care and"
"attention, however.”"
John drew out a five-pound note. “Can you buy her any little things
"with this? When you have spent it, if you will tell me, I 'll send you"
another.”
"“It's against our rules,” said the Sister, eying the money. “If you like"
"to give it as a subscription to the general funds, I will accept it.”"
“Are you badly off?” asked John.
“We are very slenderly endowed.”
John pushed the note across the small table near which they were
sitting.

"_my_ jewels. The other old bag, stolen from me, contains the paste"
replica you had made to deceive me.”
It was all so confused that I do not know how it happened. I think it
was Muller who opened the safe.
"“There is the new yellow bag,” cried Moulton, “from Schloss’ own safe."
Open it.”
"McLear had taken it. He did so. There sparkled not the real gems, but"
the replica.
"“The devil!” Moulton exclaimed, breaking from Winters and seizing the"
old bag.
He tore it open and—it was empty.
"“One moment,” interrupted Kennedy, looking up quietly from the counter."
"“Seal that safe again, McLear. In it are the Schloss jewels and the"
products of half a dozen other robberies which the dupe Muller—or
"Stein, as you please—pulled off, some as a blind to conceal the real"
"criminal. You may have shown him how to leave no finger prints, but you"
yourself have left what is just as good—your own forehead print.

"closer to the letter even than I was, when Buster was taken suddenly"
"ill, I—well, I began to worry.”"
"She finished with a little nervous laugh, as people will to hide their"
real feelings.
"“I should like to see the dog,” remarked Kennedy simply."
"“Miss Sears,” asked her mistress, “will you get Buster, please?”"
The nurse left the room. No longer was there the laughing look on her
face. This was serious business.
"A few minutes later she reappeared, carrying gingerly a small dog"
basket. Mrs. Blake lifted the lid. Inside was a beautiful little
"“Peke,” and it was easy to see that Buster was indeed ill."
"“Who is your doctor?” asked Craig, considering."
"“Dr. Rae Wilson, a very well-known woman physician.”"
"Kennedy nodded recognition of the name. “What does she say?” he asked,"
observing the dog narrowly.
"“We haven’t told anyone, outside, of it yet,” replied Mrs. Blake. “In"
"fact until Buster fell sick, I thought it was a hoax.”"
“You haven’t told anyone?”
“Only Reginald and my daughter Betty. Betty is frantic—not with fear
"""Why?"""
"""Because it is a mystery, and in all probability she will endeavour to"
preserve the secret.  She must not see the Countess before we question
"her."""
"""Is she yet conscious?""  I asked in eagerness."
"""Yes; but at present we must put no question to her."""
"""Thank Heaven!""  I gasped.  Then I added, fervently grasping my friend's"
"hand: ""You cannot realise, Dick, what great consolation this is to me!"""
"""I know, my dear fellow--I know,"" he answered sympathetically.  ""But may"
I speak to you as a friend?  You won't be offended at anything I am
"about to say, will you?"""
"""Offended?--certainly not.  Our friendship is too firm for that, Dick."
"What is it you wish to say?"""
"I saw that he was uneasy, and was surprised at his sudden gravity."
"""Well,"" he said, after a moment's hesitation, ""you'll forgive me for"
"saying so, but I don't think that in this affair you've told me exactly"
"the truth."""
"""What do you mean?""  I inquired quickly."
"""I mean that when you parted from her this afternoon you were not"
"altogether good friends."""
"""You are mistaken,"" I assured him.  ""We were as good friends as ever"
"""Yes."""
"""Much?"""
"Kilshaw leant forward and answered, almost in a whisper,"
"""Five hundred on Friday night,"" and in spite of himself he avoided the"
Superintendent's shrewd eye. But that officer's business was not to pass
"moral judgments. Law is one thing, morality another."
"""Then the thing's as plain as a pikestaff. This Gaspard got to know"
"about the money, and murdered him to get it. We needn't look further for"
"a motive."""
"""I suppose all this will have to come out? I wonder if Gaspard knew who"
"Benham was?"""
"""It's not necessary to suppose that, unless we believe all Evans says."
"Certainly, if we trust Evans, Gaspard hinted designs on some one before"
he could have known Benyon had this money. Could he have known he was
"going to have it?"""
"""Benyon may have told him I had promised to help him."""
"""Well, sir, we must see about that. We shall want you at the inquest,"
"sir."""
"""I suppose you will, confound you! And I should think you'd want a"

The Superintendent looked grave.

"""We've simply got to make him laugh,"" I whispered to Tommy. ""It's a"

"""Then wait till we have supper, and get him soused,"" my confederate"
"cautiously replied. ""That'll do it. But you'd better not drink much,"" he"
"added. ""How are the nerves this evening?"""
"""I've almost forgotten them,"" I answered."
But Tommy was persistent at times. Unknown to me he was now preparing a
report to wire the Mater.
"""Sleeping better?"" he asked."
"""Lots."""
"""Lying to me?"""
"""A little,"" I laughed outright. ""But honestly I'm in heaps better"
"shape!"""
"""Oh, I've seen you improving from day to day, but we want to put it over"

intend to. What place was it that some one said is paved with good
intentions?

The SCENE is the pretty drawing-room of a flat.  There are two
"doors, one open into the hall, the other shut and curtained."
"Through a large bay window, the curtains of which are not yet"
"drawn, the towers of Westminster can be seen darkening in a"
summer sunset; a grand piano stands across one corner.  The
"man-servant PAYNTER, clean-shaven and discreet, is arranging two"
tables for Bridge.
"BURNEY, the maid, a girl with one of those flowery Botticellian"
"faces only met with in England, comes in through the curtained"
"door, which she leaves open, disclosing the glimpse of a white"

expression of concern.

"BURNEY.  Just walks about, I fancy."
PAYNTER.  She and the Governor don't hit it!  One of these days
she'll flit--you'll see.  I like her--she's a lady; but these
thoroughbred 'uns--it's their skin and their mouths.  They'll go till
"they drop if they like the job, and if they don't, it's nothing but"
jib--jib--jib.  How was it down there before she married him?
"BURNEY.  Oh!  Quiet, of course."
"""You left her here?"" he inquired, interrupting.  ""Yes, in this very"
room.  But it seems that a quarter of an hour later one of the servants
"entered and discovered her lying upon the door, dead."""
"""Curious!"" he ejaculated.  ""Has a medical man seen her?"""
"""No.  The Countess sent for me as being one of her daughter's most"
"intimate friends, and I, in turn, sent for you."""
"""Where is the poor young lady?"""
"""In her room at the end of the corridor,"" I answered hoarsely."
"""Is there any suspicion of murder?"""
"""Apparently none whatever.  She had no visitor after I left."""
"""And no suspicion of suicide?"" he asked, with a sharp look.  ""Did you"
"part friends?"""
"""Perfectly so,"" I responded.  ""As to suicide, she had no reason, as far"
"as anyone knows, to make an attempt upon her life."""
He gave vent to an expression which sounded to me much like a grunt of
dissatisfaction.
"""Now, be perfectly frank with me, Gerald,"" he said, suddenly turning to"
"me and placing his hand upon my shoulder.  ""You loved her very dearly"
"once--was that not so?"""
I nodded.
"brutality, his masculinity, his greedy hands, his looks--she sniffed at"
all this and was excited by it. She had grown so unnatural that her sexual
needs were satisfied by keeping this man at a distance. The Torsen type no
"doubt lies in her solitary bed at night, reveling in the sensation that in"
another house a man lies writhing for her.
"But her friend, the actor? He was in no sense the other's equal. There was"
"nothing of the bull in him, nothing of action, only the braggadocio of the"
theater....
*       *       *       *       *
"Here am I, growing small and petty with this life. I question Solem about"
the accident. We are alone together in the woodshed.
Why had he lied and said the Dane wanted to climb the Blue Peak that
unfortunate Sunday morning?
"Solem looked at me, pretending not to understand."
I repeated my question.
Solem denied he had said any such thing.
"""I heard you,"" I said."
"""No, you didn't,"" he said."
A pause.
"Suddenly he dropped to the floor of the shed, convulsed, without shape, an"
outline merely; a few minutes passed before he got up again. When he was
last he stood still before her.
"“Among ordinary honourable people one takes such things for granted,” he"
said.
"“Forgive me,” she said again, humbly."
But he could find no pity for her in his heart. She had wronged him past
redemption.
“How much truth was there in the newspaper story?” he asked coldly.
She told him rapidly what Amédée Bazouge had said concerning his attack
in the hospital and his subsequent stroke.
“So the man is wilfully killing himself with absinthe?” he said.
"“It appears so,” replied Yvonne with a shudder."
“Could you tell me what passed between you otherwise--in general terms?”
"he asked, after a short silence. “You explained your position? Or did"
"you leave him in ignorance, as you were going to leave me?”"
“I told him--of course. It was necessary. And he laughed--I thought to
"spare you, Everard.”"
"“Spare me, Yvonne?”"
"“Yes,” she said, simply, “I could have borne all the pain and fright"
of it alone--why should I have made you unhappy? And _he_ said he would
"never interfere with me, and I can trust his word. Why should I have"
"told you, Everard?”"
"board H.M.S. _King Fisher_. Eventually he reached Bristol, where he"
"bought, with his share of booty, a horse and two pistols, with which to go"
on the highway.
"Hanged on June 17th, 1747, for stealing an old silver watch and 5s. from"
Mr. Francis Sleep at Dunstable.
"SKIPTON, CAPTAIN."
"Commanded a pirate ship, in which he sailed in company with Captain"
"Spriggs. Being chased by H.M.S. _Diamond_ off the coast of Cuba, Skipton"
"ran his sloop on to the Florida Reef. Escaping with his crew to an island,"
"they were attacked by the Indians, and many of them were captured and"
"eaten. The survivors, embarking in a canoe, were caught by the man-of-war"
and taken prisoner.
"SKYRM, CAPTAIN JAMES. Welsh pirate."
Hanged at the advanced age--for a pirate--of 44.
"Commanded the _Ranger_, one of Captain Roberts's ships that cruised in"
1721 and 1722 off the West Coast of Africa. In the fight with the King's
"ship that took him he was very active with a drawn sword in his hand, with"
which he beat any of his crew who were at all backward. One of his legs
"was shot away in this action, but he refused to leave the deck and go"
below as long as the action lasted. He was condemned to death and hanged
in chains.
"SMITH, GEORGE. Welsh pirate."
"Cap'n Davies lifted the box. ""It's pretty big to be diamonds but it"
looks suspicious like! And you're sure it wasn't there before? That it
"ain't the property of that summer boarder of Miss Green's?"""
"Sidney's face was flaming with excitement. ""Oh, I'm _sure_! The other"
stuff was there but there wasn't any box under it. If I hadn't been so
excited listening I'd have realized I was sitting on something
"different. Can't we look inside?"""
"""We won't take the time to look at anything now, mate. We'll get"
ashore. I reckon by this time there are folks strainin' their eyes for
"a sight o' you--"""
He fairly pushed Sidney and Mart ahead of him and toward the _Sally_.
"Saunders lifted the girls into the smaller boat, then took the box."
"""To Rockman's. Quick as you can make it,"" snapped Cap'n Phin."
CHAPTER XXII
"""YOU NEED A BIG BROTHER"""
Aunt Achsa had not slept through the storm. Accustomed though she was
"to the howl of the wind and the roar of the pounding surf, tonight it"
filled her heart with dread. Lavender had not come home.
Twice during the night hours she crept to the door of his small room
"""I am a soldier,"" answered Vaviloff, with a modest air."
"""That is easily seen, and I am sure we shall be able to finish this job"
"without much trouble."""
"""Just so."""
"""Good!  You have the law on your side, and will, of course, win your"
"case.  I want to tell you this at the very beginning."""
"""I thank you most humbly,"" said the sergeant, rubbing his eyes in order"
to hide the smile in them.
"""But tell me, why did you make the acquaintance of your future"
"neighbours like this through the law courts?"""
Vaviloff shrugged his shoulders and did not answer.
"""It would have been better to come straight to us and settle the matter"
"peacefully, eh?  What do you think?"""
"""That would have been better, of course, but you see there is a"
"difficulty ...  I did not follow my own wishes, but those of others ..."
I learned afterwards that it would have been better if ... but it was
"too late."""
"""Oh!  I suppose some lawyer taught you this?"""
"""Someone of that sort."""
"""Aha!  Do you wish to settle the affair peacefully?"""
"""Were you just like what you are now when you were young?"" asked"
Kuvalda simply.  The other's nostrils twitched.  Ivan Andreyevitch
"sighed, passed his hand over his eyes and said:"
"""Oh!  When I was young I had to undergo a great many difficulties ..."
"Work!  Oh!  I did work!"""
"""And you cheated, too, I suppose?"""
"""People like you?  Nobles?  I should just think so! They used to grovel"
"at my feet!"""
"""You only went in for robbing, not murder, I suppose?"" asked the"
"Captain.  Petunikoff turned pale, and hastily changed the subject."
"""You are a bad host.  You sit while your guest stands."""
"""Let him sit, too,"" said Kuvalda."
"""But what am I to sit on?"""
"""On the earth ... it will take any rubbish ..."""
"""You are the proof of that,"" said Petunikoff quietly, while his eyes"
shot forth poisonous glances.
"And he went away, leaving Kuvalda under the pleasant impression that"
the merchant was afraid of him.  If he were not afraid of him he would
long ago have evicted him from the dosshouse.  But then he would think
"twice before turning him out, because of the five roubles a month. And"
the Captain gazed with pleasure at Petunikoff's back as he slowly
"retreated from the courtyard. Following him with his eyes, he noticed"
again.
"""I s'pose they had one o' them little lovers' quarrels an' that made 'er"
"tell you, eh?"" She laughed a forced little laugh, though her heart was"
"beating strangely as she kept on: ""He's the kind o' man who sort o'"
"polkas with every girl he meets."" And at this she began to laugh almost"
hysterically.
"Rance, who resented her apologising to anyone but himself, stood"
scowling at her.
"""What are you laughing at?"" he questioned."
"""Oh, nothin', Jack, nothin',"" half-cried, half-laughed the Girl. ""Only"
"it's kind o' funny how things come out, ain't it? Took in! Nina"
Micheltoreña! Nice company he keeps--one o' them Cachuca girls with
"eyelashes at half-mast!"""
"Once more, she broke out into a fit of laughter."
"""Well, well,"" she resumed, ""an' she sold 'im out for money! Ah, Jack"
"Rance, you're a better guesser'n I am!"" And with these words she sank"
down at the table in an apathy of misery. Horror and hatred and
hopelessness had possession of her. A fierce look was in her eyes when a
"moment later she raised her head and abruptly dismissed the boys,"
saying:
"""Well, boys, it's gittin' late--good-night!"""
Sonora was the first to make a movement towards the door.
"""Come on, boys,"" he growled in his deep bass voice; ""don't you intend to"
"""No doubt.  As soon as she returned she began to talk of him."""
And next instant I recollected the strange effect the news of his
"arrival in Paris had had upon Yolande, and the curiously tragic event"
which had subsequently occurred.  All was puzzling--all inscrutable.
A silence fell between us.  I was revolving in my mind whether I should
ask this wizen-faced old leader of Society a further question.  With
sudden resolve I turned to her again and asked:
"""O Baronne, I had quite forgotten.  Do you chance to know the Countess"
"de Foville, of Brussels?  They have a chateau down in the Ardennes, and"
"move in the best set in Belgium?"""
"""De Foville?  De Foville?"" she repeated.  ""What, do you mean the mother"
"of that little witch Yolande?"""
"""Yes.  But why do you call her a witch?""  I demanded, with feigned"
laughter.
"""Why?"" cried the old woman, the expression of her face growing dark with"
"displeasure.  ""Well, I do not know whether she is a friend of yours, but"
"all I can tell you is that should she be, the best course for you to"
"pursue is to cut her acquaintance."""
"""What do you mean?""  I gasped."
"""I mean exactly what I have said."""
"""But I don't understand,"" I cried.  ""Be more frank with me,"" I implored."
"the sea outside and the flowers in the delft bowl laughed, too."
“The angel has been having a good time.”
John cleared his throat again.
"“My dear,” said he, and then he stopped short. All the carefully"
prepared exordiums went out of his head. How now to break the news to
her he did not know.
“Are you very tired?” she asked.
"“Not a bit,” said John."
"“Then be a dear, and read me something. Read me 'Elaine.' ”"
The elevated and sophisticated and very highly educated may learn
with surprise that “The Idylls of the King” still appeal to ingenuous
fifteen. Thank God there are yet remaining also some sentimentalists of
fifty who can read them with pleasure and profit!
"“But that is so sad, Stellamaris,” said John. “You don't want to be sad"
this beautiful spring morning.”
"Which was a very inconsistent remark to make, seeing that he was about"
to dash the young sun from her sky altogether.
"“I like being sad sometimes, especially when the world is bright."
"And Lancelot was such a dear,”--here spoke ingenuous fifteen,--“and"
"Elaine--oh, do read it!”"
"So John, secretly glad of a respite, drew from the bookcase which held"
"voice. ""The Swabian dynasty is no more."""
"With a cry and a sob that shook his whole being, Francesco covered his"
face with his hands.
For a moment the duke stared blankly at the speaker.
"""And the Frangipani?"" he asked, his features ashen-gray and drawn."
The messenger pointed to Astura.
"""There is feasting and high glee: the Pontiff's bribe was large.""--"
Francesco trembled in every limb.
"""Such a day was never seen in Naples,"" the messenger concluded with a"
"shudder. ""To a man they died under the axe--the soil was dyed crimson"
"with their blood."""
There was a silence.
"The messenger pointed to the sea, which had melted into the indefinite"
background of the night.
"Dim and distant, like a pearl over the purple deeps, one sail after"
"another struck out of the vague west. They came heading for the land,"
the black hulls rising and falling against the tumultuous blackness of
the clouds.
A red gleam started suddenly from the waves. A quick flame leaped up
like a red finger above the cliff.
"""Another thief crep' into camp,"" coldly observed the Girl almost"
simultaneously with the report.
Johnson winced.
"""Poor devil!"" he muttered. ""But of course, as you say, he's only a"
"thief."""
In reply to which the Girl uttered words to the effect that she was glad
he had been caught.
"""Well, you're right,"" said Johnson, thoughtfully, after a short silence;"
"then determinedly and in short jerky sentences, he went on: ""I've been"
thinking that I must go--tear myself away. I have very important
"business at dawn--imperative business . . ."""
"The Girl, who now stood by the table folding up the white cloth cover,"
"watched him out of the corner of her eye, take down his coat from the"
peg on the wall.
"""Ever sample one o' our mountain blizzards?"" she asked as he slipped on"
"his coat. ""In five minutes you wouldn't know where you was. Your"
important business would land you at the bottom of a canyon 'bout twenty
"feet from here."""
Johnson cleared his throat as if to speak but said nothing; whereupon
the Girl continued:
"""You say you believe in Fate. Well, Fate has caught up with you--you got"
"to stay here."""
"Andrews chuckled. ""I'll do better than our young pilot friend. The man"
"is big, and should be muscular, but he is soft from lack of exercise."
"Yet he'll attempt to stay there longer than I did, I guess."""
"""No doubt."""
"He eyed her sharply, not missing her repetitious dry reply."
"""Which, incidentally,"" he said, ""gives me my first chance to speak with"
"you alone since we took off from Earth."""
"""That's so. But--"""
"""Miss Hemingway, you are an exceedingly brisk young woman, attractive"
"and intelligent. May I ask if you have ever taken a lover?"""
"""Why, no."""
"""Never considered it?"""
"She smiled thinly. ""Naturally. All women think about it. Most do."
"I--er--"""
"Alice let her voice trail away uncertainly. The direct, frontal attack"
"had put her off-balance, but she realized that this was Andrews' direct"
way.
"He had smiled at her uncertainty, and said swiftly, ""Then may I be the"
"first--"" when he noted the fading amusement in her face and glibly ad"
"libbed--""to congratulate you on your choice of young men? The space"
commodore to whom you bade farewell in Chicago was an up and coming
"man, I'd assume."""
"“H’m, h’m!--yes. Pills.”"
“Mr. Pangbutt’s father?”
"“H’m, h’m! Yes. I assure you.”"
“Dear me! And he has such a very distinguished manner!”
“And--d’you know?”
She whispered.
“Lady Persimmon? Indeed?”
The lady of the lorgnettes nodded mysteriously. The withered eyes
expressed shocked surprise. She gave a funny little laugh. The
"lorgnettes were raised again, and she said, surveying the assembled"
guests critically through the glasses:
“I absolutely _adore_ literary people--and artists--and actors--and
those sort of persons. It is so strange to think they have all slept
"in attics. And really, it’s quite the _fashion_ to go on the stage"
now.... Who’s the fright in the post-office red?... Oh! is it?... Lady
"Margaret’s son has gone on the stage.... Gerty, do you know who that"
"dark creature is? with the Italian-looking person.... Oh, yes; and the"
"young fellow is getting on wonderfully. You see, they like to have"
"a gentleman on the stage--besides, he acts in the most gentlemanly"
"manner--quite unlike a professional actor. And then, of course, his"
manager is rather exclusive--he called the company together the other
"day, and told them that he did not expect them to recognise him in"
the street. It’s so nice for the young fellow to be with such a
And the _Triumphants_ towed alongside.
"""Up you go,"" said Benson."
"""I won't,"" said Smith."
"""Won't you?"" asked Benson.  ""We'll see about that.  Hook on there,"
"Billings."""
And the next moment Smith was jammed in a running bowline round his
waist.
"""Sway him up,"" said Benson; and the crew of the _Harvester_ hoisted"
the notorious robber with about the only feelings of pleasure they
were likely to know till they reached New York.  And the
_Triumphants_ pushed off as they heard the mate address Mr. Smith in
language which did his reputation and the reputation of the ship most
ample justice.
"""There's talk and there's a fore-topsail-yard-ahoy voice for you,"""
"said Benson.  ""Oh, Mr. Smith will be looked after, he will.  Now,"
"chaps, pull for it, or the admiral will be waitin', and if that"
"'appens, 'twill be 'Stand from under.'"""
THE POLICY OF THE _POTLUCK_.
"Concerning the permanent and immutable characteristics of ships, the"
unhappy man who has never had his limited range of vision broadened
by a trip in a sailing ship must of necessity know little.  He
cymbal claps. Triumphantly the _maialino_ looked around. He out-smacked
all.
"The bread of the country is rather coarse and brown, with a hard, hard"
crust. A large rock of this is perched on every damp serviette. The
"_maialino_ tore his rock asunder, and grumbled at the black-cap, who had"
got a weird sort of three-cornered loaf-roll of pure white bread--starch
white. He was a swell with this white bread.
"Suddenly black-cap turned to me. Where had we come from, where were we"
"going, what for? But in laconic, sardonic tone."
"""I _like_ Sardinia,"" cried the q-b."
"""Why?"" he asked sarcastically. And she tried to find out."
"""Yes, the Sardinians please me more than the Sicilians,"" said I."
"""Why?"" he asked sarcastically."
"""They are more open--more honest."" He seemed to turn his nose down."
"""The padrone is a Sicilian,"" said the _maialino_, stuffing a huge block"
"of bread into his mouth, and rolling his insouciant eyes of a gay,"
well-fed little black pig towards the background. We weren't making much
headway.
"""You've seen Cagliari?"" the black-cap said to me, like a threat."
"""Yes! oh Cagliari pleases me--Cagliari is beautiful!"" cried the q-b,"
who travels with a vial of melted butter ready for her parsnips.
"The foreigners, perceiving that the Englishman was on an errand of"
"peace, gathered about the case, and soon discovered from the"
stencilled inscription that it at any rate pretended to come from
Cognac.
"""Goddam,"" said the little red-capped Frenchman who had first"
"discovered them.  ""Cognac!  I spik English--brandee, Por'smout',"
"Lon-don!"""
Jones made signs that he presented the case to them.
"""I ain't above makin' a concession or two,"" he remarked"
"confidentially to the French captain; ""but if I'd listened to my lot"
"on board, it would 'ave been blood up to the neck."""
The Frenchman shook his head.
"""You bet it would 'ave bin,"" said Jones earnestly, ""but what d'ye say"
"to 'avin' a drink?  Billy, gimme your knife."""
"And with it he started opening the case, while the Frenchmen's eyes"
gleamed in pleasing anticipation.  They had not had a drink for
weeks.  And as they carried the case down to the ship with Jones and
"their own captain in the rear, they concluded that the English were"
not such bad chaps after all.
"""But where's my man 'Art!"" asked Jones, when he came to the French"
camp.
"""'Ere I be,"" cried Hart, who was lashed hard and fast to a round"
"rock.  ""Lord, captain, but I've 'ad a time.  Can't you cut me adrift,"
her hands on his arm. The boy's form in its light underwear showed
pitifully crooked but Sidney saw him straight and she saw the gleam in
his eyes. Suddenly she remembered what Vick had said so lightly about
"the Grail. Ah, she was seeing its gleam now, transcendently beautiful,"
in Lav's eyes! She dropped her hold of his arm.
"""You see, I've _got_ to try it, Sid."" And she understood. He went on:"
"""I'll swim for the lighthouse. They can telephone from there to"
Rockman's. You girls find a light and signal with it. Don't lose your
"nerve, Sid."" He poised for an instant on the rail then plunged into the"
black water.
"""Oh, _Lav_,"" cried Sidney. She leaned far over the side of the boat."
"She could see nothing but a crest of foam. ""Mart, he's--he's--drowned!"""
Pola screamed again.
CHAPTER XX
"""THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG!"""
In the sunny embrasure of Mrs. White's morning room Trude Romley sorted
"over the mail that Pepper, the butler, had brought in. So gay and"
"colorful was the room itself with its cretonnes, its soft tinted walls,"
"its singing birds, in wicker cages, that it seemed a part of the"
fragrant garden that crowded close to the French windows. A tiny
fountain splashed azure blue water over delicately sculptured nymphs; a
flowering vine trailed around the windows.
"let a lady go to bed?"""
One by one the men filed through the door which Nick held open for them;
"but when all but himself had left, the devoted little barkeeper turned"
"to the Girl with a look full of meaning, and whispered:"
"""Do you want me to stay?"""
"""Me? Oh, no, Nick!"" And with a ""Good-night, all! Good-night, Sonora, an'"
"thank you! Good-night, Nick!"" the Girl closed the door upon them. The"
last that she heard from them was the muffled ejaculation:
"""Oh, Lordy, we'll never git down to Cloudy to-night!"""
Now the Girl slid the bolts and stood with her back against the door as
"if to take extra precautions to bar out any intrusion, and with eyes"
that blazed she yelled out:
"""Come out o' that, now! Step out there, Mr. Johnson!"""
Slowly the road agent parted the curtains and came forward in an
attitude of dejection.
"""You came here to rob me,"" at once began the Girl, but her anger made it"
impossible for her to continue.
"""I didn't,"" denied the road agent, quietly, his countenance reflecting"
how deeply hurt he was by her words.
"""You lie!"" insisted the Girl, beside herself with rage."
"""I don't--"""
"Germans, or any other barbarians.”"
"“Yes, this hotel is a hive of petty aristocrats.”"
“Your sister was telling me that you might pick out a very rich wife
"here, among the girls.”"
"“Yes, my sister would like me to live here, in a foreign country, in"
"cowlike tranquillity, looking at pictures and statues, and travelling"
pointlessly. That wouldn’t be living for me; I am not a society man. I
"require excitement, danger.... Though I warn you that I am not in the"
least courageous.”
“You’re not?”
“Not at all. Not now. At moments I believe I could control myself and
take a trench without wavering.”
"“But you have some fixed plan, haven’t you?”"
"“Yes, I expect to go back to Spain, and work there.”"
“At what?”
“In politics.”
“Are you patriotic?”
"“Yes, up to a certain point. I have no transcendental idea of patriotism"
"at all. Patriotism, as I interpret it, is a matter of curiosity. I"
believe that there is strength in Spain. If this strength could be
"led in a given direction, where would it get to? That is my form of"
"She was seated in a chair, motionless and statuesque, staring straight"
"before her.  The blow had utterly crushed her, for she was entirely"
devoted to her only daughter now that her husband was dead.  I well knew
"how deep was her affection for Yolande, and how tender was her maternal"
love.
"The room was in semi-darkness, for she had not risen to turn on the"
"light.  As I entered I did so with her permission, saying quietly:"
"""Madame, I come to you with a message."""
"""From whom?"" she asked in a hard mechanical voice."
"""From my friend Deane, the English doctor whom I have summoned.  Yolande"
"still lives!"""
"""She lives!"" she cried, springing to her feet in an instant.  ""You are"
"deceiving me!"""
"""I am not, madame,"" I reassured her, smiling.  ""Your daughter is still"
"breathing, and is increasing in strength perceptibly.  The doctors say"
"that she will probably recover."""
"""Thank God!"" she gasped, her thin white hands clasped before her.  ""I"
"pray that He may give her back to me.  I will go to her."""
"But I held her back, explaining that both the medical men had expressed"
a wish to remain there alone.
"""But what caused that appearance so akin to death?"" she asked quickly."
"daughter, I am pleased to tell you, will live; but she must be kept"
absolutely quiet.  I cannot allow you to approach her on any pretext
"whatsoever."""
"""She will not die, will she?"" the woman implored distractedly."
"""No,"" he replied, in a voice somewhat strained, I thought, ""she will not"
"die.  Of that you may rest assured."""
"Then turning to me, he beckoned, and I followed him out of the room."
CHAPTER EIGHT.
THE OLD LOVE.
"""I don't like that woman, old fellow,"" were the first words Dick uttered"
when we were alone in the room in which Yolande had been found.
"""Why not?""  I asked, rather surprised.  ""The Countess de Foville is"
"always charming."""
"He shrugged his shoulders, saying:"
"""One sometimes has strange and unaccountable prejudices, you know.  This"
"is one of mine."""
"""And Yolande,"" I asked, ""what of her?"""
"""She's better.  But it was fortunate I made the discovery just when I"
"did, or she would no doubt have passed away.  I never saw an appearance"
"so closely resembling death in all my experience; in fact, I'd have"
"staked my professional reputation that there was no spark of life."""
"""Would you go out in the grounds where we sat yesterday and fetch my"
"galoshes?"""
So he went out to do her this great favor. He sang a well-known popular
"song as he crossed the yard, cheerful in his own peculiar way."
She turned to me.
"""You seem silent."""
"""Do I?"""
"""Yes, you're very silent."""
"""Listen to this,"" I said, and began to read to her from the book I held in"
my hands. I read a longish bit.
"She tried to interrupt me several times, and at length said impatiently:"
"""What is this you want me to listen to?"""
"""The _Musketeers_. You must admit it's entertaining."""
"""I've read it,"" she said. And then she began to clasp her hands and drag"
them apart again.
"""Then you must hear something you haven't read before,"" I replied, and"
went across to my room to fetch a few pages I had written. They were only
"a few poems--nothing special, just a few small verses. Not that I am in"
"the habit of reading such things aloud, but I seized on this for the"
"moment because I wanted to prevent her from humbling herself, and telling"
me anything more.
"harm."""
"""No; nothing will do anybody harm if it gives you pleasure."""
"At that bitter retort, he kept silence a long time, now and then heaving"
"a long sigh.  His words kept sounding in her heart: ""The soul, not the"
"body, is faithful.""  Was he, after all, more faithful to her than she had"
"ever been, could ever be--who did not love, had never loved him?  What"
"right had she to talk, who had married him out of vanity, out of--what?"
And suddenly he said:
"""Gyp!  Forgive!"""
"She uttered a sigh, and turned away her face."
"He bent down against the eider-down.  She could hear him drawing long,"
"sobbing breaths, and, in the midst of her lassitude and hopelessness, a"
"sort of pity stirred her.  What did it matter?  She said, in a choked"
voice:
"""Very well, I forgive."""

The human creature has wonderful power of putting up with things. Gyp
never really believed that Daphne Wing was of the past.  Her sceptical
instinct told her that what Fiorsen might honestly mean to do was very
different from what he would do under stress of opportunity carefully put
"address given in the letter, he found that his brother had gone out not"
fifteen minutes before.
"“Mebbe if you step in an’ wait he’ll be back soon,” suggested the"
slatternly woman who kept the house.
"Curly was shown to a room on the second floor back, where he recognized"
a number of Bill’s belongings scattered about in the usual disorder.
Perhaps it was the sight of them which aroused in the young fellow an
"increasing doubt of his ability to do what he came for. Would this man,"
"who had never been in the habit of taking any one’s advice, listen to"
"him? He wondered, and then, unable to remain still, arose and paced the"
floor anxiously.
"Presently he dropped in a chair before a rough deal table, on top of"
which was tacked a large sheet of blotting paper. A corner of white
"""You don't happen to have lost one of your crew, tryin' to desert by"
"swimmin', sir?"""
"""Have you picked him up?  What's his name, does he say?"""
"""It's Smith, sir."""
"""That's the man,"" said Sant.  ""I want him badly."""
But Smith cried out:
"""This is kidnappin', Mr. Sant.  I refuse to go."""
"""Oh, Smith,"" said Sant, ""I'll take all the chances of it's bein'"
"anythin' you like.  Throw them a rope."""
leaned far back in his arms.
"""No,"" was the man's truthful answer."
"""Oh, how glad I am! Take me--ah, take me I don't care where as long as"
"it is with you!"" cried the Girl in an ecstasy of delight."
"""So help me, God, I'm going to . . .!"" promised Johnson, his voice"
"strained, tense. ""You're worth something better than me, Girl,"" he"
"added, a moment later, ""but they say love works miracles every hour,"
that it weakens the strong and strengthens the weak. With all my soul I
"love you, with all my soul I--"" The man let his voice die out, leaving"
"his sentence unfinished. Suddenly he called: ""Why, Min-Minnie!"""
"""I wasn't really asleep,"" spoke up the Girl, blinking sleepily. ""I'm"
"jest so happy an' let down, that's all."" The next moment, however, she"
was forced to acknowledge that she was awfully sleepy and would have to
say good-night.
"""All right,"" said Johnson, rising, and kissed her good-night."
"""That's your bed over there,"" she told him, pointing in the direction of"
the curtains.
"""But hadn't you better take the bed and let me sleep over here?"""
"""Not much!"""
"""You're sure you would be more comfortable by the fire--sure, now?"""
"""Yes, you bet!"""
"""Wouldn't it be a good idea to call him again? It's rather important!"""
"""Oh, you think we shouldn't have gone out in a storm like this? I've"
"been dreadfully uneasy!"""
"""No danger at all,"" I declared, with affected indifference, adding: ""The"
"weather isn't half as rough as 'the old dear' will be, take my word for"
"it!"""
"A shadow of mystification passed over her wonderful face, yet she smiled"
"with well-bred tolerance, saying:"
"""You are quite droll."""
"""Drollery is the brother of good fellowship,"" I replied, helping her"
"across the reeling cabin. As I had feared, she went directly to my room"
where the door had swung back showing an empty bunk.
"""Why, he's up, after all,"" she glanced over her shoulder at me."
"""I believe he is,"" I idiotically affirmed."
"""But where?""--this more to herself."
"""Hiding, maybe,"" I ventured, taking a facetious squint about."
"""Hiding?"" she asked, in mild surprise."
"""Er--playing a trick on us! He's a funny old dog at tricks!"""
"""Funny old dog?"" She drew slightly away from me. ""Do you mean my father,"
"Mr.--er?"""
beginning to smite him hard.
"""Don't laugh!"""
"""I'm not laughing,"" as indeed he was not."
"""O' course every girl kind o' looks ahead,"" went on the Girl in"
explanation.
"""Yes, I suppose,"" he observed seriously."
"""An' figgers about bein'--well, Oh, you know--about bein' settled. An'"
"when the right man comes, why, she knows 'im, you bet! Jest as we both"
"knowed each other standin' on the road to Monterey. I said that day,"
"he's good, he's gran' an' he can have me."""
"""I could have you,"" murmured Johnson, meditatively."
The Girl nodded eagerly.
There was a long silence in which Johnson was trying to make up his mind
"to tear himself away from her,--the one woman whom he loved in the"
"world,--for it had been slowly borne in upon him that he was not a fit"
mate for this pure young girl. Nor was his unhappiness lessened when he
"recalled how she had struggled against yielding to him. At last,"
"difficult though it was, he took his courage in both hands, and said:"
"""Girl, I have looked into your heart and my own and now I realise what"
"this means for us both--for you, Girl--and knowing that, it seems hard"
"to say good-bye as I should, must and will . . ."""
At those clear words spoken by lips which failed so utterly to hide his
want to say something in that moment. Will you be my wife? I haven’t
"had time to make love to you in the ordinary way, but I really do love"
"you. Talk quick, please—those fellows are clubbing the stuffing out of"
Union Pacific.”
"“Oh, what are you talking about?” exclaimed the young lady. She rose to"
"her feet and gazed upon him, round-eyed."
"“Don’t you understand?” said Maxwell, restively. “I want you to marry"
"me. I love you, Miss Leslie. I wanted to tell you, and I snatched a"
minute when things had slackened up a bit. They’re calling me for the
"’phone now. Tell ’em to wait a minute, Pitcher. Won’t you, Miss"
Leslie?”
The stenographer acted very queerly. At first she seemed overcome with
amazement; then tears flowed from her wondering eyes; and then she
"smiled sunnily through them, and one of her arms slid tenderly about"
the broker’s neck.
"“I know now,” she said, softly. “It’s this old business that has driven"
everything else out of your head for the time. I was frightened at
"first. Don’t you remember, Harvey? We were married last evening at 8"
o’clock in the Little Church Around the Corner.”
AFTER TWENTY YEARS
The policeman on the beat moved up the avenue impressively. The
"impressiveness was habitual and not for show, for spectators were few."
"""I'm a domestic man,"" he said suddenly.  ""A domestic man in a serious"
line of life; and I never thought to have anything like this in my
"family--never!  It's been--well, I can't tell you what it's been!"""
Gyp took up her sunshade.  She felt that she must get away; at any moment
he might say something she could not bear--and the smell of mutton rising
fast!
"""I am sorry,"" she said again; ""good-bye""; and moved past him to the door."
"She heard him breathing hard as he followed her to open it, and thought:"
'If only--oh! please let him be silent till I get outside!'  Mr. Wagge
passed her and put his hand on the latch of the front door.  His little
piggy eyes scanned her almost timidly.
"""Well,"" he said, ""I'm very glad to have the privilege of your"
"acquaintance; and, if I may say so, you 'ave--you 'ave my 'earty"
"sympathy.  Good-day."""
"The door once shut behind her, Gyp took a long breath and walked swiftly"
"away.  Her cheeks were burning; and, with a craving for protection, she"
"put up her sunshade.  But the girl's white face came up again before her,"
and the sound of her words:
"""Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen, I wish I was dead!  I DO!"""

"Gyp walked on beneath her sunshade, making unconsciously for the peace of"
CHAPTER XVIII
"""HOOK!"""
Sidney found it a little difficult to take up the fun with her
erstwhile chums where she had left off. When she stopped at the
"Calkins' house directly after breakfast, Mart coolly declined to go"
"anywhere with her, and smiled scornfully at her bare legs."
"""I s'pose your million-dollar friend is otherwise engaged today!"""
"Sidney truthfully admitted that she was. ""She's gone to Chatham with"
her mother to see some people they know. And I'm glad. I've been just
"dying for a good swim. Let's go out to the _Arabella_ this morning."""
But Mart declared she was tired of all that. In fact she was tired of
doing lots of the silly things they'd been doing. She'd promised Gert
Bartow to go there right after lunch.
Sidney had no choice but to go on alone in search of Lav. She was
discouraged to the point of tears. Yet she knew in her heart that she
deserved Mart's coldness. She remembered how she had felt once when
Nancy had deserted her for a new girl at Miss Downs'. And it had
seriously threatened their friendship.
As she wandered slowly toward the town Sidney wondered what Mart and
Gert Bartow were going to do. Gert Bartow was a girl of nineteen at
"least, and much more grown up than even that. Mart had pointed her out"
to Sidney. Sidney wished Mart had asked her to go with her to Gert's.
She felt very lonely.
“Quick!” he repeated.
It was too late.
"“For God’s sake, Kennedy,” shouted a voice at the street door, “what"
are you doing here?”
"It was McLear himself. He had come with the Hale patrol, on his mettle"
now to take care of the epidemic of robberies.
Before Craig could reply a cab drew up with a rush at the curb and two
"men, half fighting, half cursing, catapulted themselves into the shop."
They were Winters and Moulton.
"Without a word, taking advantage of the first shock of surprise,"
Kennedy had clapped a piece of chemical paper on the foreheads of Mrs.
"Moulton, then of Moulton, and on Muller’s. Oblivious to the rest of us,"
he studied the impressions in the full light of the counter.
Moulton was facing his wife with a scornful curl of the lip.
“I’ve been told of the paste replica—and I wrote Schloss that I’d shoot
"him down like the dog he is, you—you traitress,” he hissed."
She drew herself up scornfully.
“And I have been told why you married me—to show off your wicked jewels
and help you in your—”
“You lie!” he cried fiercely. “Muller—some one—open this safe—whosever
"it is. If what I have been told is true, there is in it one new bag"
"“Now, now,” said Fluffy Reubens, sprawling in two chairs. “Chuck it,"
Blotte--you make me feel as cold as a dead undertaker.... Lor!” he
"yawned, “this is precious slow.” He yawned again: “Paul Pangbutt’s a"
"confounded long time, ain’t he? Scenting his beard, I suspect!”"
"Andrew Blotte roused from his mood, and he began to pace up and down"
the room as before: “No more Italian waiters for me--with cursèd oily
"locks,” he cried--“no more grease-spots on dingy grey tablecloths that"
hide their offences under smiling napkins!... To-night I shall be
waited upon by the gods.... Never again the boiled potato; never again
"the homely bun, damn them!... This is the night of life--a night for"
"music and gaiety and minstrelsy.... Hunger shall cease, and pain----”"
"Rippley went up to him and took him by the shoulder, kindly:"
"“Stop it, Blotte. Aren’t you well, old man?”"
Blotte laughed:
“Well?... Psha! I am like a boy. The new genius arrives to-night. And I
go off--to sup with the gods.... The world has forgotten Andrew Blotte.”
"Rippley turned, a twinkle in his eye, to the others:"
"“I say, boys,” said he--“as it’s to be a unique night, and Blotte"
"about to be translated, and may be in the papers in the morning----”"
"Blotte laughed grimly, where he paced:"
"“Oh, yes,” he growled--“I shall be in the papers to-morrow. Have no"
fear of it.”
"“I wanted to tell you about it, that 's all,” said Risca. “I made up my"
mind this afternoon. The only thing is what the deuce am I to do with a
child of fifteen in Fenton Square?”
“Is she pretty?”
"“Lord, no. Coarse, undersized little cockney, ugly as sin.”"
"“Anyhow,” said Herold, extinguishing his cigarette in the ash-tray,"
"“it's out of the question.” He rose from his chair. “Look here,” he"
"cried with an air of inspiration, “why not send her down to The Channel"
House?”
“I'm not going to shift responsibilities on to other people's
"shoulders,” John growled in his obstinate way. “This child 's my"
"responsibility. I 'm going to see her through somehow. As to Southcliff,"
"you must be crazy to suggest it. What's to prevent her, one fine"
"day, from getting into Stella's room and talking? My God! it would be"
appalling!”
Herold agreed. He had spoken thoughtlessly.
"“I should just think so,” said Risca. “The idea of such a tale of horror"
being told in that room--”
"The dresser entered. “Miss Mercier has just gone on, sir.”"
"“Well, just think out something else till I come back,” said Herold. “At"
"any rate, Fenton Square won't do.”"
He left John to smoke and meditate among the clothes hanging up on pegs
"listlessly, and his large head drooped forward as if at last its weight"
had proven too great for the squat body.
"""What's wrong?"" I asked."
"""How do you know there is anything wrong, my boy Jack?"""
"""You look so killingly happy,"" Tommy said, joining us."
"Monsieur's pale eyes stared for a moment, then blinked several times"
before he murmured:
"""The man I went to see is dead--murdered, just after he mailed that"
report. So I have no information. These police called it suicide because
a knife lay in his hand. Bah! I could place a knife in the hand of any
"man I kill!"""
"""Was he a friend of yours?"""
"""No. I have never seen him. But he knew something!"""
"""He evidently knew too much,"" Tommy suggested."
"""You speak true, my boy. It seems to be a dangerous thing here to know"
"too much of certain matters!"""
"""Well,"" I laughed, trying to put a heartiness in my voice and drive away"
"his depression, ""let's go ashore for dinner! Then the Opera--and"
"afterwards another bite where the high life eats? What-say, Professor?"""
"As it turned out, however, neither the dinner, nor all of Tommy's"
"banter, nor Madame Butterfly sung in Spanish (as if it could!) succeeded"
"that scoundrel, not if you do divorce 'im.  No; she'll have her disgrace"
"for nothing."""
"Gyp, who had listened with her head a little bent, raised it suddenly,"
and said:
"""There'll be no public disgrace, Mr. Wagge, unless you make it yourself."
If you send Daphne--Daisy--quietly away somewhere till her trouble's
"over, no one need know anything."""
"Mr. Wagge, whose mouth had opened slightly, and whose breathing could"
"certainly have been heard in the street, took a step forward and said:"
"""Do I understand you to say that you're not goin' to take proceedings,"
"ma'am?"""
"Gyp shuddered, and shook her head."
"Mr. Wagge stood silent, slightly moving his face up and down."
"""Well,"" he said, at length, ""it's more than she deserves; but I don't"
"disguise it's a relief to me.  And I must say, in a young lady like you,"
"and--and handsome, it shows a Christian spirit."" Again Gyp shivered, and"
"shook her head.  ""It does.  You'll allow me to say so, as a man old"
"enough to be your father--and a regular attendant."""
He held out his hand.  Gyp put her gloved hand into it.
"""I'm very, very sorry.  Please be nice to her."""
"Mr. Wagge recoiled a little, and for some seconds stood ruefully rubbing"
his hands together and looking from side to side.
"formidable in small operations. He kept his cab at the door, rang, and"
"asked for Gyp, with a kind of pleasure in his ruse."
"""She's not in yet, sir.  Mr. Fiorsen's in."""
"""Ah!  And baby?"""
"""Yes, sir."""
"""I'll come in and see her.  In the garden?"""
"""Yes, sir."""
"""Dogs there, too?"""
"""Yes, sir.  And will you have tea, please, sir?"""
"""No, thanks.""  How to effect this withdrawal without causing gossip, and"
"yet avoid suspicion of collusion with Gyp?  And he added: ""Unless Mrs."
"Fiorsen comes in."""
"Passing out into the garden, he became aware that Fiorsen was at the"
"dining-room window watching him, and decided to make no sign that he knew"
"this.  The baby was under the trees at the far end, and the dogs came"
rushing thence with a fury which lasted till they came within scent of
"him.  Winton went leisurely up to the perambulator, and, saluting Betty,"
"looked down at his grandchild. She lay under an awning of muslin, for"
"fear of flies, and was awake.  Her solemn, large brown eyes, already like"
"Gyp's, regarded him with gravity.  Clucking to her once or twice, as is"
"the custom, he moved so as to face the house.  In this position, he had"
Betty with her back to it.  And he said quietly:
"know--"""
"""Daphne Wing?"""
"""Yes.  A child is coming.  They have made her tell.  It means the"
"cancelling of her engagements, of course--and other things."""
Gyp uttered a little laugh; then she said slowly:
"""Can you tell me, please, what this Mr.--Wagge can do?"""
Again Rosek shrugged his shoulders.
"""He is rabid--a rabid man of his class is dangerous.  A lot of money will"
"be wanted, I should think--some blood, perhaps."""
"He moved swiftly to her, and said very low:"
"""Gyp, it is a year since I told you of this.  You did not believe me"
"then.  I told you, too, that I loved you.  I love you more, now, a"
"hundred times!  Don't move!  I am going up to Gustav."""
"He turned, and Gyp thought he was really going; but he stopped and came"
back past the line of the window.  The expression of his face was quite
"changed, so hungry that, for a moment, she felt sorry for him.  And that"
"must have shown in her face, for he suddenly caught at her, and tried to"
"kiss her lips; she wrenched back, and he could only reach her throat, but"
"that he kissed furiously.  Letting her go as suddenly, he bent his head"
and went out without a look.
"Gyp stood wiping his kisses off her throat with the back of her hand,"
"dumbly, mechanically thinking: ""What have I done to be treated like this?"
"""Solem has gone now,"" Josephine replied."
"""Lucky for him!"""
"""Why?"" asked Josephine."
"""Oh, he's a dreadful creature!"""
How agitated she was! But in the course of the day she calmed down. Her
"anger dissolved, and there was neither weeping nor a scene; only she did"
"not walk proudly, as was her habit, but preferred to sit in silence."
"That passed too; she roused herself briskly soon after Solem's departure,"
"and in a few days she was the same as ever. She took walks, she talked and"
"laughed with us, she made the actor swing her in the children's swing, as"
in the lawyer's day....
"I went out one evening, for there was good weather and darkness for"
walking; there was neither a moon nor stars. The gentle ripple of the
little Reisa river was all the sound I heard; there were God and Goethe
"and _über allen Gipfeln ist Ruh'_ that night. On my return, I was in"
"the mood to walk softly and on tiptoe, so I undressed and went to bed in"
the dark.
"Then they came again to my window, those two lunatics, the lady and the"
actor. What next? But it was not he that chose this spot; of that I was
sure. She chose it because she was convinced I had returned. There was
something she _wanted_ me to hear.
Why should I listen to him still pleading with her?
"""I've had enough of this,"" he said. ""I'm leaving tomorrow."""
"Winstanley, after Yvonne had gone again."
"“I am sacrificing them for my wife’s happiness, Emmeline,” he replied,"
with a touch of irony.
"“Yes, it would be a pity to spoil her pleasure. She is such a child.”"
"“I wish we all had something of her nature,” said the Canon."
Mrs. Winstanley noted the snub. She was treasuring up many resentments
against Yvonne. In her heart she considered herself a long-suffering
woman.
"“You seem to enjoy it too, Everard,” said Yvonne to him that evening."
They were sitting near the entrance watching the smartly-dressed people.
“And I am so glad to be alone with you.”
"He was pleased, smiled at her, and throwing off his dignity, entered"
into the frivolous spirit of the place. Yvonne forgot the restraint she
had always put upon her tongue when talking to him. She chattered about
"everything, holding her face near him, so as to be heard through the"
"hubbub of thousands of voices, the eternal shuffling of passing feet,"
and the crash of the orchestra in the far gallery.
"“It is a _Revue des Deux Mondes,_” she said, looking rapidly around"
"her, with bright eyes."
“How?” asked the Canon.
"“The _beau_ and the _demi_,” she replied, wickedly. She shook his knee."
"“Oh, do look at that woman! what does she think a man can see in her!”"
"his coat. He stopped laughing then, by calculated degrees."
"""Sit down--sit down!"" said he wheezily. ""What's your hurry? You haven't"
told me yet what those few 'trifling formalities' are. And how am I to
"know whether--"""
"But Slyne was already beyond the doorway, fumbling with a last button."
"""If you believe I've come here to talk simply for the sake of talking,"""
"said he with sombre magnificence, ""I needn't waste any more breath on"
"you. Good-bye."""
"Captain Dove jumped out of his bunk. He was clearly impressed, in spite"
"of himself, by the other's indomitable assurance."
"""Come back, you fool!"" he called angrily. ""Come back. I want to know--"
"""I'll go ashore with you,"" he shouted, raising his voice, since Slyne"
was already on his way to the gangway. But Slyne did not seem to hear.
"""I'll take your offer--for Sallie,"" cried Captain Dove, in a slightly"
lower tone.
"Slyne hesitated in his stride, stopped, and turned back into the"
alleyway which led to the saloon.
"""What was that you said?"" he demanded of Captain Dove."
"""Come on inside,"" requested Captain Dove, more curtly."
"""I don't believe I will,"" Slyne declared, inwardly elated over the"
"winning of that somewhat risky move. ""You don't deserve another chance."
Travers seized his arm. His eyes shone with a painful excitement.
"""Yes--yes!"" he stammered. ""You have a chance--a sure hope. I can save"
you; I can--atone. That's what I want. Only you must help me. I am a
dying man. I want you to bring me to the Rajah--at once. Only five
minutes with him--that will be enough. Then he will let you go--he
"must!"""
Nicholson freed himself resolutely from the clinging hands.
"""You exaggerate your power,"" he said, ""and, besides, what you ask is"
"an impossibility."""
"He turned away, but Travers caught his arm and held him with a"
"frantic, desperate strength."
"little given to humiliating your neighbours, male or female....”"
"“Yes, yes; but we are not so conceited or such play-actors as you are."
"A woman may think herself pretty and amiable and sweet, and not be so."
"That is true; but on the other hand, every man thinks himself braver"
"than the Cid, even if he is afraid of a fly, and more talented than"
"Seneca, even if he is a dolt.”"
"“To sum up, men are a calamity.”"
“Just so.”
“And women spend their lives fishing for these calamities.”
“They need them; there are inferior things which still are necessary.”

the walls in places.
At some distant day the chamber had evidently been occupied by human
"beings, for a great fire-place was cut in the rock at one end, and there"
were niches in the wall which had doubtless been used for storage. The
"floor was smooth, showing the work of human hands."
“Get onto the fire-place!” whispered Jimmie. “Where do you suppose the
smoke goes? There’s no chimney on the mountain.”
"“Probably it escapes through some opening in the rock,” Ned answered."
"“Do you suppose,” Jimmie asked, “that the smoke vent is large enough for"
us to hide in?”
"Before the words were out of the boy’s mouth, Ned was making toward the"
"fireplace. The light was out now, but Jimmie had no difficulty in"
following the boy in the darkness.
“Ned!” he called softly in a moment.
“Come on up!” whispered Ned.
"“Turn on the light, then,” Jimmie advised."
"Ned switched on the electric, but kept it inside the chimney into which"
he had climbed. Only a faint radiance reached the opening below.
"“Give me your hand,” whispered Ned, “and I’ll give you a lift.”"
The sound of voices and footsteps now echoed loudly through the cavern.
King Merriwig of Euralia sat at breakfast on his castle walls.  He
"lifted the gold cover from the gold dish in front of him, selected a"
trout and conveyed it carefully to his gold plate.  He was a man of
"simple tastes, but when you have an aunt with the newly acquired gift"
"of turning anything she touches to gold, you must let her practise"
sometimes.  In another age it might have been fretwork.
"""Ah,"" said the King, ""here you are, my dear.""  He searched for his"
"napkin, but the Princess had already kissed him lightly on the top of"
"the head, and was sitting in her place opposite to him."
"""Good morning, Father,"" she said; ""I'm a little late, aren't I?  I've"
"been riding in the forest."""
"""Any adventures?"" asked the King casually."
"""Nothing, except it's a beautiful morning."""
"""Ah, well, perhaps the country isn't what it was.  Now when I was a"
"young man, you simply couldn't go into the forest without an adventure"
"of some sort.  The extraordinary things one encountered!  Witches,"
"giants, dwarfs----.  It was there that I first met your mother,"" he"
added thoughtfully.
"""I wish I remembered my mother,"" said Hyacinth."
The King coughed and looked at her a little nervously.
"""Seventeen years ago she died, Hyacinth, when you were only six months"
old.  I have been wondering lately whether I haven't been a little
"remiss in leaving you motherless so long."""
her completely naked.
"Dennis went clumsily to his knees, his arms around her, and he pulled"
"her to the floor. She sobbed, but the tears were gone now and they were"
"dry, wracking sobs."
"""Undress me."""
She fumbled with his jacket and pulled it off while he knelt there in
"anticipation of he knew not what; wondering, wanting, knowing only an"
urge he could not understand but which had become a compulsion.
She took off his necktie and unbuttoned his shirt. Frank Corson stirred
"but did not regain consciousness. ""Please,"" Rhoda said, ""let me help"
"him."""
"In answer, Dennis put his arms around her and drew her to him. ""We will"
"make love."""

Now quick tears shone like stars in Trude Romley's eyes. She reached
out her hands and caught Sidney's.
"""Oh, Lavender--when I think what _he_ did I--I--"" She could not finish,"
but Sidney understood the gratitude that was in her heart. She leaned
her face against Trude's shoulder with a long sigh.

Sidney obeyed reluctantly. In her mingled remorse and humiliation she
shrank from facing the world. She was not even curious as to why Cap'n
Phin wanted to see her.
By the time she had dressed Trude had a poached egg and a glass of milk
ready for her. Miss Letty was with Lavender and Aunt Achsa had gone to
bed.
Sidney begged so hard that Trude accompany her to Rockman's that Trude
put on her hat and went with her. And poor Sidney needed Trude's

I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books;
every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable
"soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the"
"blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all,"
when I suddenly got scared right through.
His eyes.
They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them.
Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did
"it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a"
surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it
opened two long tooth-studded jaws.
"""Green shatas!"" he said suddenly. ""Only a tadpole. I must be getting"
"jumpy enough to splash."""
Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly
"leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted"
"to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes."
"I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. ""My name is Ferdinand"

"the telephone-room slammed, and at the same moment Charlotte called,"
"“Is that you, father?”"
"“You’re tired again,” said Charlotte reproachfully, and she stopped the"
rocker and offered her warm plum-like cheek. Bright-haired Ethel pecked
"his beard, Marion’s lips brushed his ear."
"“Did you walk back, father?” asked Charlotte."
"“Yes, I walked home,” said old Mr. Neave, and he sank into one of the"
immense drawing-room chairs.
“But why didn’t you take a cab?” said Ethel. “There are hundreds of
cabs about at that time.”
"“My dear Ethel,” cried Marion, “if father prefers to tire himself out,"

"“Children, children?” coaxed Charlotte."

He turned to her with a gesture of disclaimer. She thought he was going

"""What is going to happen?"" he asked, with an uneasy smile."
"""Oh, how can I?"" she burst out. ""How can I say it? How can I ask you?"""
"As she spoke she stopped, and he followed her example. They stood facing"

"who, I suppose, were right to tell me----"""
In a moment he understood her. A slight twitch of his mouth betrayed his

"“Hurt me? No,” said Tom, putting up the hooks again, taking out a large"

meditatively as he rubbed his finger along it. Then he added:
“I gave Spooner a black eye--that's what he got for wanting to leather

"“Oh! how brave you are, Tom. I think you are like Samson. If there came"

"“How can a lion come roaring at you, you silly thing? There's no lions"

"“No, but if we were in the lion countries--I mean in Africa where it's"

"“Well, I should get a gun and shoot him.”"
"“But if you hadn't got a gun?--we might have gone out, you know, not"
"thinking, just as we go out fishing, and then a great lion might come"

"There was now a fine, cold drizzle falling, and the wind had risen from"
its uncertain puffs into a steady blow. The few foot passengers astir
in that quarter hurried dismally and silently along with coat collars

"the man who had come a thousand miles to fill an appointment, uncertain"
"almost to absurdity, with the friend of his youth, smoked his cigar and"
waited.
"About twenty minutes he waited, and then a tall man in a long overcoat,"
"with collar turned up to his ears, hurried across from the opposite"
side of the street. He went directly to the waiting man.
"“Is that you, Bob?” he asked, doubtfully."
"“Is that you, Jimmy Wells?” cried the man in the door."

Then Dugald Allan spied Pola shivering forlornly behind Mart and
"Sidney. ""_You_--"" he cried, pushing Sidney aside. ""I thought you were"
"at Chatham!"" His mouth tightened in a straight, stern line. ""What is"
"all this? But wait, I must get Sidney back to Aunt Achsa. You shall"
"explain things as we go along."""
"He hurried the girls through the crowd which parted, smilingly, to let"
"them pass. On Commercial Street he hailed old Hiram Moss, who with an"

After he had bundled his charges in Dugald Allan turned to Sidney.

God it has not ended as it might have ended though Lavender is still

But before Sidney could begin her tale she had to know what had
happened to Lavender.
"""Fighting for his life? But--he _got here_, didn't he?"""
"""Yes--he reached shore, by an effort so great as to completely"
"prostrate him. They took him home. I left Doctor Blackwell with him."""
Dugald Allan spoke shortly and his crisp sentences had the effect of
"stunning poor Sidney. She shivered and leaned close to him. Her voice,"

At length the Rogan leader spoke. He addressed his sibilant words to

"he is head of all the Rogan race on this globe, and that all on this"

Brand nodded to show he understood the message.

And Simcox went below.

she saw the ruin that had been inflicted:

"We ascended the cellar stairs. The mother was in the main room, wiping"
"her eyes. We said good-bye to her and her daughter, feeling ashamed of"
"our uniforms, and walked out into the street."
A mass of French cavalry were galloping past. It was growing dark. The
cannonade had become deafening. Over the town a few miles off there was

to Boswell.
“You have come to see me?” she cried delightedly. “Mr. Trent has just
"been telling us that you came down with him, and I hoped you would call"

"“Yes, to be sure—to be sure. You might have known I would call soon.”"
"He bowed stiffly to Trent, and, seating himself close beside Jessica,"
murmured in her ear: “Cannot you get rid of that fellow? How did he find
you out so soon?”
"“Why, he came to see Edith, of course. Do you not remember how devoted"
he always was to her?”
“I do not—”
"“May I ask what you are whispering about, Mr. Boswell?” demanded Trent,"
breaking from Miss Decker. “Is he confiding to you the astounding
"success of his last novel, Mrs. Pendleton? Or was it a history of the"
United States? I really forget.”
"“Not the last, certainly. I leave it to you to make history—an abridged"
edition. My ambition is a more humble one.”
"“Oh, you will both need biographers,” said Mrs. Pendleton, who was"
beginning to enjoy herself. “I will give you an idea. Join the
Theosophists. Arrange for reincarnation. Come back in the next

*CHAPTER VIII.*
*A STARTLING DISCOVERY.*
As Grey Dumaresq drifted downstream with the tide that sunny July
"morning, he felt as though something new and wonderful had come into his"
"life, as though some great and marvellous change had fallen upon him,"
"which, for good or ill, must leave its mark upon his life."
"“Well, crowd along!” advised Ned."
“Crowd along?” repeated Jimmie. “What for?”
"“Use your nose,” advised Ned."
Jimmie sniffed elaborately and hit Ned a resounding whack on the back.
Then he sat down on the bottom of the passage.
"“Say, Ned, look here!” he said. “When we got into this scrape, we didn’t"
"look for any old Franciscan monks to help us out, did we? Two or three"
"hundred years ago, when they dug this passage through the rock, they"
"hadn’t any idea they were digging it for us, had they?”"
"“This is a mysterious world,” Ned answered. “It seems to be unnecessary"
for us to plan any mode of escape. The wise old chap who formed the
"Franciscan order in Europe, hundreds of years ago, prepared the way of"
escape for us!”
“That’s what he did!” answered Jimmie. “And I wish he had gone a little
farther and prepared a good fat meat pie for us.”
"“Jimmie,” Ned chuckled, “some day you’ll get into a corner where you"
won’t get anything to eat for a week. I never knew a boy who thought so
much of his stomach as you do!”
“May the day be long delayed!” laughed Jimmie.
"“Well, crawl along!” Ned advised, “and I’ll see if I can get this slab"
of stone you pushed out back in its place.”
"""But how'll we get ashore?"""
"""The tide'll be out towards morning."""
"""You mean _swim_?"" cried Pola. ""But I _can't_ swim! I--I--"""
"True, Pola's complex! Sidney hastened to reassure her."
"""When the tide's out it won't be over your head. And I'll help you."""
Lavender had already let the line of the dory slip out of his hand.
They saw the old boat become a shadowy outline as the tide carried it
"slowly away, then--nothing. Pola caught Sidney's hand and held it."
"""I'm not frightened--but it's so--_spooky_!"""
It had been decided that they should conceal themselves in the
"fo'castle cabin. They groped their way forward, Sidney guiding Pola in"
"the dark, for Lavender dared not light any of his matches. Stumbling,"
"scarcely breathing, they slipped down the companion ladder and crawled"
"into the small, ill-ventilated cabin. Sidney sat down upon some"
tarpaulins. Pola crouched close to Sidney's side. Lav and Mart stowed
themselves upon one of the bunks.
"""There--now we'll wait!"""
"""I--I wish I knew what _for_!"" whispered Pola. The smell of rank bilge"
"water, the lift and drop of the boat sickened her. The wind was whining"
and that and the swish of the water against the sides of the boat
terrified the girl.
In a few short words Lav vouchsafed Pola a little information. Like
The pair drifted away.
And there is something else I cannot finish doing: withdrawing into
"solitude in the woods, alone with the good darkness round me. This is the"
last pleasure.
"One needs solitude and darkness, not because one flees the company of"
"others and can endure only one's own, but because of their quality of"
"loftiness and religion. Strange how all things pass distantly, yet all is"
near; we sit in an omnipresence. It must be God. It must be ourselves as a
part of all things.
"What would my heart, where would I stray?"
Shall I leave the forest behind me?
It was my home but yesterday;
now toward the city I wend my way;
to the darkness of night I've resigned me.
"The world round me sleeps as I tarry, alone,"
soothing my ear with its quiet.
How large and gray is the city of stone
in which the many all hopes enthrone!
"Shall I, too, accept their fiat?"
Hark! Do the bells ring on the hillside?
Back to the peace of the forest I turn
in the nightly hour that's hoarest.
There's a sweet-smelling hedgerow to which I yearn;
"I shall rest my head on heather and fern,"
and sleep in the depths of the forest.
"and peered in, shielding her candle with a trembling hand. For a long"
while she sat in the window straining her eyes into the darkness. The
cats came and rubbed her bare ankles and Nip meowed plaintively. She
picked him up and cuddled him to her.
Suddenly a moving object in the lane caught her attention. It separated
"itself into the forms of men, men moving slowly as though they bore a"
burden. They turned into the garden patch.
"""Lavender!"" Aunt Achsa cried, jumping up quickly, shaking. ""Oh--my boy!"""
But that was the only sound she made. She opened the door as though she
had been waiting for these men with their limp burden. She directed
them to carry the boy to his own room. She moved aside for Doctor
"Blackwell who had come with the others, an old pair of flannel trousers"
drawn over his night shirt. She felt Mr. Dugald put a restraining arm
"over her shoulders and nodded as though to say: ""I'm all right--just"
"look out for Lavender."""
One of the men coming back from Lavender's room offered an explanation.
"""Those young 'uns were on the _Arabella_ and it broke from its"
"moorin's. The boy swum ashore to give an alarm. Plucky, I say--don't"
"know how he did it."""
"""Those young ones--_who_?"" cried Dugald Allan."
"""Why, I cal'late that gal Sidney and I don't know who else--"""
"""Sidney went with Miss Vine!"" protested Achsa."
"But at that moment Miss Letty appeared in the door, as scantily clad as"
the doctor had been. From her window which faced Doctor Blackwell's
"hands with his own. “It’s Bob, sure as fate. I was certain I’d find you"
"here if you were still in existence. Well, well, well!—twenty years is"
"a long time. The old restaurant’s gone, Bob; I wish it had lasted, so"
"we could have had another dinner there. How has the West treated you,"
old man?”
"“Bully; it has given me everything I asked it for. You’ve changed lots,"
Jimmy. I never thought you were so tall by two or three inches.”
"“Oh, I grew a bit after I was twenty.”"
"“Doing well in New York, Jimmy?”"
"“Moderately. I have a position in one of the city departments. Come on,"
"Bob; we’ll go around to a place I know of, and have a good long talk"
about old times.”
"The two men started up the street, arm in arm. The man from the West,"
"his egotism enlarged by success, was beginning to outline the history"
"of his career. The other, submerged in his overcoat, listened with"
interest.
"At the corner stood a drug store, brilliant with electric lights. When"
they came into this glare each of them turned simultaneously to gaze
upon the other’s face.
The man from the West stopped suddenly and released his arm.
"“You’re not Jimmy Wells,” he snapped. “Twenty years is a long time, but"
not long enough to change a man’s nose from a Roman to a pug.”
"“It sometimes changes a good man into a bad one,” said the tall man."
Then he gave a great cry.
"""Ever, ever night!"" he said, stretching out his hands despairingly as"
to an eternal void.
The duke's eyes seemed to look leagues away over moor and valley and
"hill, where the blackened ruins of Astura rose beneath a dun smoke"
against the calm of the morning sky.
"A strange tenderness played upon his lips, as if with the extinction"
of the Frangipani brood peace had entered his soul.
"""A man is a mystery to himself,"" he said."
"""But to God?"""
"""I know no God, save the God, my own soul! Let me live and"
"die,--nothing more! Why curse one's life with a 'to be?'"""
Francesco sighed heavily.
"""It is a kind of Fate to me!"" he said, ""inevitable as the setting of"
"the sun, natural as sleep. Not for myself do I fear it alone,--but I"
"should not like to think that I should never see her again."""
"The duke's eyes had caught life on the distant hillside, life surging"
"from the valleys, life and the glory of it. Harness, helm and shield"
"shone in the sun. Gold, azure, silver, scarlet were creeping from the"
bronzed green of the wilds. Silent and solemn the host rolled slowly
into the full splendor of the day.
The duke's face had kindled.
“He’s after us now all right!” whispered Jimmie.
"“Keep still, you little dunce!” Ned said."
"“If he sticks his head up here, soak him!” advised Jimmie."
"“Don’t you think I won’t,” Ned returned."
But Huga did not enter the huge old fireplace at all. When he flashed
"his light into the chimney he saw only straight up, and the vertical"
passage from the fire-flue was too small for even a small cat to
negotiate.
The chamber into which the boys had found their way was directly at the
"back of the flue, and might have been seen by a more careful man. The"
boys chuckled as the half-breed turned away.
In a few minutes the sounds of pursuit ceased entirely. Lights no longer
"flashed about the room, creating a faint mist in the fireplace below."
Still the boys were not certain that the outlaws had abandoned the hunt.
"“Say, Ned,” Jimmie whispered, directly, poking Ned in the ribs, “you"
"didn’t bring one of those bear steaks with you, did you?”"
"“Why, Jimmie,” Ned said in pretended amazement, “you’re not getting"
"hungry, are you? I’m astonished at that!”"
“Hungry!” repeated the boy. “I feel as if I could eat my way through
this rock like a mouse eats through cheese! And I could drink a barrel
of water. There never was such a thirst.”
For an instant Brand was dumbfounded. For here was language he could
understand--which was incredible on this far-flung globe. Then he
suddenly comprehended why her sentences were so intelligible.
She was versed in mental telepathy. And versed to a high degree! He'd
had some experience with telepathy on Venus; but theirs was a crude
thought-speech compared to the fluency possessed by the beautiful girl
before him.

"""I am Greca""--it was very hard to grasp names or abstract terms--""of"

"""Oh, no! I am their captive, as are all my people. We are but slaves"
"of the tall ones."""
"Brand glanced at Dex. ""Here's a chance to get some information,"
"perhaps,"" he murmured."
Dex nodded; but meanwhile the girl had caught his thought. She
"smiled--a tragic, wistful smile."
"""I shall be happy to tell you anything in my power to tell,"" she"
"informed him. ""But you must be quick. I can only remain with you a"
"little while."""
She sat down on the floor with them--the few bench-like things
obviously used by the tall creatures as chairs were too high for
"what's the use of jaw?  I say get up stores, eh, Mackenzie?"""
"""Don't ask me,"" said old Mac.  ""I was thinkin' that mighty soon we'd"
"be able to settle that question about the buildin' of the _Potluck_."""
And as by this time Jones was calming down and was rather inclined to
"cry, Lampert came up to the restive crowd."
"""You dry up, Hart,"" he said roughly.  ""Until the ship's broken up,"
"you're on the articles.  Say another word and I'll break your jaw."""
"""Yes, sir,"" said Hart respectfully."
"Until dawn they loafed about the deck and in the cabin and foc'sle,"
"discussing whether they were on one of the Crozets or what, and"
"whether they would stay long there, and if so what, and so on."
And just as the dawn broke over the island they got an awful
surprise.  They saw a man standing on the low cliff on about a level
with the jagged splinters of the fore-topmast where it had gone short
in the cap.
"""The bloomin' hisland's in'abited,"" cried a foremast hand, and every"
one rushed forward to interview the gesticulating stranger.
"""Wod's the bloke say?"" asked the crowd.  ""Oh, say it again!""  And the"
stranger said it again.
But the crowd shook a unanimous head.
"""I believe the silly galoot don't talk English,"" cried Hart; ""'ere,"
"where's Dutchy?"""
for himself.
"""Congratulations."""
"""Thank you."""
"""That ought to grease the way in the Diet for your deal. And the"
protocol's financial grab ought to sail through the Supreme Soviet. You
prove this marvel can work and the rest is merely laundering your
"profits."""
"""So I would like to think,"" he nodded. ""Of course, one never knows how"
"these things will eventually turn out."""
"""So when do I get a look at it?"""
"""Why, that all depends on certain agreements we need to make."""
"""Then I guess it's time I heard the bottom line."""
"""Most assuredly."" He leaned back. ""Dr. Vance, you have just caused me"
considerable hardship. Nor is this the first occasion you have done so.
"Yet, I have not achieved what I have to date without becoming something"

"London demonstrated, I thought, remarkable ingenuity. There could be a"
"place for you in my organization, despite all that has happened between"

"""Don't be foolhardy. Those days are well behind me,"" he went on calmly,"
"despite the flicker of anger in his eyes. ""The completion of this"
"“Father never talks his business over with any one,” Jack broke in."
"“If we had only known about the outlaws being here in the hills,” Harry"
"suggested, “we might have kept out of sight of them for a long time."
"But, you see, they found us first.”"
"“And they used a nice, crooked little spy to do it with!” Frank"
exclaimed. “This little alleged Boy Scout who stole our provisions last
"night, and crept into the woods to tell Jimmie and I to beat it, and"
"then brought a note to Ned to get him away from the camp, must be"
playing a leading part for the sneaks.”
“He’s doing all of that!” Jack agreed. “I don’t believe he’s a Boy Scout
at all. He’s just picked up a word or two and a sign.”
"“Perhaps we’ll run across him again,” Frank said. “If we do, I’ll find"
out whether he’s a Boy Scout or not!”
"“Well,” Jack exclaimed, springing to his feet, “are we going to sit here"
all day and let Jimmie do all the hunting? We ought to get out in the
mountains and help find Ned.”
"“Look here, boys!” Harry cried, “do you see anything to the east there"
that looks at all familiar?”
“Do you mean the smoke coming up over the tops of the trees?” asked
Frank. “I noticed that several minutes ago.”
"“Well, just keep your eye on it,” Harry advised, “and see if it brings"
anything to your mind.”
"“Sure it does!” shouted Frank, all excitement now. “There are two"
"adopt her now,” said Miss Lindon, with an illuminating flash of logic."
"“Quite so,” replied John."
There was a span of silence. John mechanically drew his pipe from his
"pocket, eyed it with longing, and replaced it. Miss Lindon took the aged"
black-and-tan terrier in her arms and whispered to it in baby language.
She was a million leagues from divining the object of her nephew's
visit. John looked at her despairingly. Had she not a single grain of
"common sense? At last he strode across the room, a Gulliver in a new"
"Lilliput, and sat down again by her side."
"“Look here, 'Aunt Gladys,” he said desperately, “if I adopt a young"
"woman of sixteen, I must have another woman in the house--a lady, one"
of my own family. I could n't have people saying horrid things about her
and me.”
Miss Lindon assented to the proposition. John was far too young and
"good-looking (“Oh, Lord!” cried John)--yes, he was--to pose as the"
"father of a pretty, grown-up young woman."
"“The poor child is n't pretty,” said he."
"“It does n't matter,” replied Miss Lindon. “Beauty is only skin deep,"
and I 've known plain people who are quite fascinating. There was
Captain Brownlow's wife--do you remember the Brownlows? Your poor mother
was so fond of them--”
"“Yes, yes,” said John, impatiently. “He had wet hands, and used to mess"
"my face about when I was a kid. I hated it. The question is, however,"
whom am I going to get to help me with Unity Blake?”
affair.  The very existence of the secret has brought us together
"again."""
"""You mean that you have forsaken Edith and returned to her?"" he"
"observed, raising his brows slightly in surprise."
"""No; don't put it in that way,"" I implored.  ""I have not yet forsaken"
"Edith."""
"He smiled, just a trifle superciliously, I thought."
"""And the Countess is also in possession of this mysterious secret--eh?"""
"""Of that I am not at all certain,"" I replied."
He sniffed in distinct suspicion that what I had told him was not the
"truth.  At the same instant, however, the Countess entered and demanded"
to know the condition of her child.
"""She is much better, madame,"" he answered.  ""Perfect quiet is, however,"
"necessary, and constant observation of the temperature.  To-morrow, or"
"the day after, you may, I think, see her."""
"""Not till then!"" she cried.  ""I cannot wait so long."""
"""But it is necessary.  Your daughter's life hangs upon a single thread."""
"She was silenced, for she saw that argument was useless."
A few minutes later Jean entered with a message from Trepard asking Dick
"and myself to consult with him.  We therefore left the Countess again,"
and passed along the corridor to the room in which my love of long ago
"""They're hostile, whatever they are,"" said Dex. ""Look out: that one's"
"pointing something at you!"""
"One of the slender, tottering creatures had raised an arm and leveled"
"at Brand something that looked rather like an elongated, old-fashioned"
flashlight. Brand involuntarily ducked. The clear glass panel between
them and the mob outside gave him a queasy feeling of being exposed to
whatever missile might lurk in the thing's tube.
"""What do we do now?"" demanded Dex with a shaky laugh. ""You're chief of"
"this expedition. I'm waiting for orders."""
"""We wait right here,"" replied Brand. ""We're safe in the shell till"
"we're starved out. At least they can't get in to attack us."""
"But it developed that, while the slimy looking things might not be"
"able to get in, they had ways of reaching the Earthmen just the same!"
*       *       *       *       *
The creature with the gun-like tube extended it somewhat further
toward Brand.
"Brand felt a sharp, unpleasant tingle shoot through his body, as"
"though he had received an electric shock. He winced, and cried out at"
the sudden pain of it.
"""What's the matter--"" Dex began. But hardly had the words left his"
"mouth when he, too, felt the shock. A couple of good, hearty Earth"
oaths exploded from his lips.
The character of his relations towards them was confirmed by the
"appearance of his clothes, which, as a rule, were tidy, and cleaner"
"than those of his companions.  And now, sitting at the door of the"
"dosshouse, he boastingly related that for a long time past Redka had"
"been asking him to go and live with her, but he had not gone because he"
did not want to part with the company.  They heard this with jealous
"interest.  They all knew Redka.  She lived very near the town, almost"
"below the mountain.  Not long ago, she had been in prison for theft."
"She was a retired nurse; a tall, stout peasant woman, with a face"
"marked by smallpox, but with very pretty, though always drunken, eyes."
"""Just look at the old devil!"" swore Abyedok, looking at Simtsoff, who"
was smiling in a self-satisfied way.
"""And do you know why they love me?  Because I know how to cheer up"
"their souls."""
"""Do you?"" inquired Kuvalda."
"""And I can make them pity me....  And a woman, when she pities!  Go and"
"weep to her, and ask her to kill you ... she will pity you--and she"
"will kill you."""
"""I feel inclined to commit a murder,"" declared Martyanoff, laughing his"
dull laugh.
"""Upon whom?"" asked Abyedok, edging away from him."
"""It's all the same to me ... Petunikoff ... Egorka ... or even you!"""
"""And why?"" inquired Kuvalda."
"""But there's jest one thing you've overlooked explainin', Mr. Johnson."
It shows exactly what you are. It wasn't so much your bein' a road agent
"I got against you. It's this:"" And here she stamped her foot excitedly."
"""You kissed me--you got my first kiss."""
Johnson hung his head.
"""You said,"" kept on the Girl, hotly, ""you'd ben thinkin' o' me ever"
"since you saw me at Monterey, an' all the time you walked straight off"
"an' ben kissin' that other woman."" She shrugged her shoulder and laughed"
"grimly. ""You've got a girl,"" she continued, growing more and more"
"indignant. ""It's that I've got against you. It's my first kiss I've got"
against you. It's that Nina Micheltoreña that I can't forgive. So now
"you can git--git!"" And with these words she unbolted the door and"
concluded tensely:
"""If they kill you I don't care. Do you hear, I don't care . . ."""
At those bitter words spoken by lips which failed so utterly to hide
"their misery, the Girl's face became colourless."
"With the instinct of a brave man to sell his life as dearly as possible,"
"Johnson took a couple of guns from his pocket; but the next moment, as"
if coming to the conclusion that death without the Girl would be
"preferable, he put them back, saying:"
"""You're right, Girl."""
The next instant he had passed out of the door which she held wide open
for him.
"she asked in a low, intense voice.  ""You have forgotten me for three"
"whole years until now."""
"""I know--I know!""  I cried.  ""Forgive me."""
"""I have already forgiven,"" she said, allowing her hand still to remain"
"in mine.  ""But I have been thinking to-day--thinking ever so much."""
"Her voice was weak and faltering, and I saw that she was not herself."
"""Thinking of what?"""
"""Of you.  I have been wondering whether, if I had died, you would have"
"sometimes remembered me?"""
"""Remembered you?""  I said earnestly.  ""Why, of course, dearest.  Why do"
"you speak in such a melancholy tone?"""
"""Because--well, because I am unhappy, Gerald!"" she cried, bursting into"
"sudden tears.  ""Ah! you do not know how I suffer--you can never know!"""
"I bent and stroked her hair, that beautiful red-gold hair that I had so"
often heard admired in the great salons in Brussels.  It had been bound
"but lightly by her maid, and was secured by a blue ribbon.  She had"
"apologised for receiving me thus, but declared that her head ached, and"
"it was easier so.  Doctor Deane had called twice that morning, and had"
pronounced her entirely out of danger.
"""But why are you suffering?""  I asked, caressing her and striving to"
"charm away her tears.  ""Cannot you confide in me?"""
"She shook her head in despair, and her body was shaken by a convulsive"
"""Yolande--Yolande!""  I called, touching her cheek in an effort to awaken"
"her, for I could not believe that she was actually dead."
But there was no response.  Those blanched lips and the coldness of
those cheeks told their own tale.  She had passed to that land which
lies beyond the range of human vision.
How long I stood there I cannot tell.  My thoughts were inexpressibly
"sad ones, and the discovery had utterly upset me, so that I scarcely"
knew what I said or did.  The blow of thus finding her lifeless crushed
"me.  The affair was mysterious, to say the least of it.  Of a sudden,"
"however, the sobs of the grief-stricken Countess aroused me to a sense"
"of my responsibility, and taking her hand I led her from the bedside"
into an adjoining room.
"""How has this terrible catastrophe occurred?""  I demanded of her"
"breathlessly.  ""Only two hours ago she was well and happy."""
"""You mean when you saw her?"" she said.  ""What was the object of your"
"call?"""
"""To see her,"" I responded."
"""And yet you parted ill friends in Brussels?"" she observed in a tone of"
"distinct suspicion.  ""You had some motive in calling.  What was it?"""
I hesitated.  I could not tell her that I suspected her daughter to be a
spy.
"""In order to assure her of my continued good friendship."""

"stops suddenly and stares, takes a few steps toward him, and bends"

"""Yes, it is. Good evening, Miss Torsen."""
"""Why, good evening. I thought it looked like you. Good evening. Yes, thank"

"""Do you live here? What a strange coincidence!"""
"""Yes, I live here; those are my windows. You wouldn't like to come up,"
"would you? No, perhaps you wouldn't."""
"""But I know where there are some benches down by the shore. Unless you're"
"cold?"" I suggested."
"""No, I'm not cold. Yes, thank you, I'd like to."""
"We went down to a bench, looking like a father and daughter out walking."
"There was nothing striking about us, and we sat the whole evening"
undisturbed. Later we sat undisturbed on other evenings all through a cold
autumn month.
"Then she told me first the short chapter of her journey home, some of it"
"only hinted, suggested, and some of it in full; sometimes with her head"
"deeply bowed, sometimes, when I asked a question, replying by a brief word"

"The Frenchmen ""jabbered"" a bit among themselves."

"""We, old son,"" said Hart; ""marshay if you like.  Just pack up and"
quit.  We gives you an hour to gather up your dunnage.  Now do you
"understand?"""
Whether the Frenchmen understood or not it was tolerably obvious they
"did not like the tone with which Hart spoke, or the looks of evident"
disfavour he cast at them.  The captain turned away.
"""Stop!"" said Hart, and he went in for a dumb pantomime, in which he"
vaguely suggested that over yonder hill was an army of Englishmen.
"""And we mean 'avin' our rights,"" he ended with.  And just then old"
Jones appeared in sight.

thing about diplomatics?  Tell 'em that to prepare for peace we makes

"Frenchmen, as his mates came tumbling down the hill."
"The fight was short, sharp, and pretty decisive, for the _Potluck's_"
"crowd numbered ten able seamen, one ordinary seaman, and two boys, or"
"with the captain and the two mates, sixteen in all.  Against this"
"array there were twenty-one Frenchmen, and though Hart, in his first"
"onslaught, knocked down two, he was himself stretched out by a third"
armed with a broken hand-spike.  And Simcox fled with the infuriated
"Dawson came back after a few minutes, picked up another cigar from"
"Cary's box, and sat down. ""You see, I have a letter from him. I found"
"it in his quarters where I went straight from the _Malplaquet_."""
"""May we read it?"" I asked gently. ""I was greatly taken with Trehayne"
"myself. He was a clean, beautiful boy. He was an enemy officer on"
"Secret Service; there is no dishonour in that. If he were alive, I"
could shake his hand as the officer of the firing party shook the hand
"of Lody before he gave the last order."""
"Dawson took a paper from his pocket, and handed it to me. ""Read it"
"out,"" said he; ""I can't."""
CHAPTER VIII
TREHAYNE'S LETTER
I took the letter from Dawson and glanced through it. The first sheet
and the last had been written very recently--just before the boy had
left his quarters for the last time to go on board the _Malplaquet_;
the remainder had been set down at various times; and the whole had
"been connected up, put together, and paged after the completion of the"
"last sheet. Trehayne wrote a pretty hand, firm and clear, the writing"
of an artist who was also a trained engineer. There was no trace in
the script of nervousness or of hesitation. He had carried out his
"Orders, he saw clearly that the path which he had trod was leading him"
"to the end of his journey, but he made no complaint. He was a Latin,"
He opened a drawer of his desk and reached for the Scotch bottle.
*       *       *       *       *
At the Newark Airport he would not trust his suitcase to a porter
because the leather loop holding one side of the handle was very thin
and he was afraid it would break.
Once he had been ashamed of the shabbiness of the bag and had planned to
"buy a new one, but now there was an affinity between them, a kind of"
warmth.
Were they companions in misery?
He asked the question with a quick smile and then realized he was not
"miserable. A little bleak of mind, perhaps, with Minnesota and what lay"
ahead affording no glow of anticipation in his mind. But that would
"pass. No, he had relegated the hurt to a mental pigeonhole; maybe he"
"would bring it out and look at it once in a while, after enough time had"
passed.
But he was not miserable.
"He went to the counter, checked in, and they told him his plane would"
take off on time. He glanced at his watch. Thirty-two minutes.
He went back to the bench and found Rhoda Kane sitting beside his
suitcase.
"She wore a plain, black suit with a ridiculous little black hat and she"
was so beautiful he was angry with her. He hated her. This good-bye
wasn't necessary. Why had she come?
"in it, to check up on the disappearance of the first. That ship, too,"
never came back. Almost with the second of its arrival at the edge of
the red area all radio communication with it was cut off. It was never
heard from again. Two weeks ago I sent Journeyman there. Now _he_ has
"been swallowed up in a mysterious silence."""
An exclamation burst from Brand's lips. Sub-Commander Journeyman!
"Senior officer under Stone, ablest man in the expeditionary forces,"
and Brand's oldest friend!
"Stone nodded comprehension of the stricken look on Brand's face. ""I"
"know how friendly you two were,"" he said soberly. ""That's why I chose"
"you to go and find out, if you can, what happened to him and the other"
"two ships."""
Brand's chin sank to rest on the stiff high collar of his uniform.
"""Journeyman!"" he mused. ""Why, he was like an older brother to me. And"
"now ... he's gone."""
*       *       *       *       *
There was silence in Commander Stone's sanctum for a time. Then Brand
raised his head.
"""Did you have any radio reports at all from any of the three ships"
"concerning the nature of the red spot?"" he inquired."
"""None that gave definite information,"" replied Stone. ""From each of"
the three ships we received reports right up to the instant when the
red area was approached. From each of the three came a vague
description of the peculiarity of the ground ahead of them: it seems
"“Phoebe,” she said, when the angular and jilted maid appeared, “we are"
"going to keep house for my nephew, Mr. Risca, and a young lady whom"
he has adopted. Will you tell me one thing? Is the lady of the house
supposed to clean the gentlemen's pipes?”
"“My father is a non-smoker, as well as a teetotaler, miss,” replied"
Phoebe.
“Dear me!” murmured Miss Lindon. “It's going to be a great puzzle.”
CHAPTER VII
"IT was a puzzle to John as much as to the palpitating lady, and in the"
maze of his puzzledom the gleam of humour that visited him during
"their interview lost its way. Walter Herold's eyes, however, twinkled"
maliciously when he heard John's account at once rueful and pig-headed.
Then he grew serious.
“It will be comic opera all the time. It can't be done.”
"“It 's going to be done,” said John, obstinately. “There's nothing else"
"to do. If I were a rich man, I could work wonders with a scratch in my"
cheque-book. I could hire an unexceptionable colonel's or clergyman's
widow to do the business. But I'm not. How I'm going to get the house
"together, as it is, I don't know. Besides,” he added, turning with some"
"savageness on his friend, “if you think it a comic-opera idea, kindly"
remember it was you who started it.”
"Though Herold was silenced for the moment, to the back of his mind still"
"He told her--he told her all he knew. She listened, horror-stricken,"
regarding him with open mouth and streaming eyes.
"“And what do you think is my duty?” asked John, abruptly."
Miss Lindon shook her head. “I 'm sure I don't know what to advise
"you, dear. I 'll try to find out some kind Christian people who want a"
servant.”
"“I don't want any kind Christian people at all,” said John. “I'm going"
to make up in ease and happiness for all the wrongs that humanity has
"inflicted on her. I am going to adopt her, educate her, fill her up with"
the good things of life.”
"“That's very fine of you, John,” said Miss Lindon. “Some people are"
as fond of their adopted children as of their own. I remember Miss
"Engleshaw adopted a little child. She was four, if I remember right,"
and she used to dress her so prettily. I used to go and help her choose
frocks. Really they were quite expensive. Now I come to think of
"it, John, I could help you that way with little Unity. I don't think"
gentlemen have much experience in choosing little girls' frocks. How old
is she?”
"“Nearly sixteen,” said John."
"“That's rather old,” said Miss Lindon, from whose mind this new interest"
seemed to have driven the tragic side of the question. “It's a pity you
could n't have begun when she was four.”
"“It is,” said John."
"“Only if you had begun with her at four, you would n't be wanting to"
"The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was"
"in for it. ""I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's"
"library,"" I told her in a hurry."
"""No doubt,"" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. ""But"
you aren't going to tell me that you read about _dunging_ in the ship's
library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of
Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible
young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed--this Terran
"Agent--"""
"""Paddlefoot,"" I sneered."
"Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. ""Now that's a term,"" she said"
"carefully, ""that is used only by Venusian riffraff."""
"""They're not!"""
"""Not what?"""
"""Riffraff,"" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the"
time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!
"""They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building"
"Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like"
"Venus."""
"""Does it, now?"" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow"
"a second pair of ears. ""Tell me more."""
"""You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start"
civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid
to make their own law if necessary--with their own guns. That's where
But here the Rogan leader turned impatiently away. Greca had been
translating sentence by sentence. Now the tall one barked out a few
syllables in a squeaky voice.
"""He says he knows you are lying,"" sighed Greca. ""For if you on Earth"
have tubes more effective than theirs why weren't you equipped with
"them on your expedition here to the red kingdom?"""
"Brand bit his lips. ""Check,"" he muttered. ""The brute has a brain in"
"that ugly head."""
*       *       *       *       *
The Rogan leader spoke for a long time then; and at each singsong
"word, Greca quivered as though lashed by a whip. At length she turned"
to Brand.
"""He has been telling what his hordes can do, answering your boasts"
with boasts of his own. His words are awful! I won't tell you all he
said. I will only say that he is convinced his shock-tubes are
"superior to any Earth arms, and that he states he will now illustrate"
their power to you to quell your insolence. I don't know what he means
"by that...."""
But she and the Earthmen were soon to find out.
The Rogan leader stepped to the window and arrogantly beckoned Brand
and Dex to join him there. They did; and the leader gazed out and down
as though searching for something.
He pointed. The two Earthmen followed his leveled arm with their eyes
the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution.

He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown
up in a surfacing boat.
"""Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we"
"might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,"
"she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four."""
"""How's that?"""
"""The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on"
Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way
"back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with"
the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die
or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the

school used to say.

“Let us think. What sort of a stone would a politician be most likely to

Mrs. Pendleton laughed. “A good idea. If couleur de rose be synonymous

"“I am sure of it. And as your author is always in the dumps, I am"
certain he takes naturally to the sapphire.”

it will be impossible. They are bound to meet here sooner or later.

The manservant threw back the portière.

The manufacturer and his wife got up.
Then the first man from Bergen made another speech.
*       *       *       *       *
"The manufacturer stayed with us for the promised three days, and then made"
ready to travel again. His mood never changed; he was contented and
entertaining the whole time. Every evening one whisky and soda was brought
"him--no more. Before their bedtime, his little girls had a wildly"
hilarious half-hour with him. At night a tremendous snoring could be heard
"from his cottage. Before his arrival, the little girls had spent a good"
"deal of time with me, but now they no longer knew I existed, so taken up"
with their father were they. He hung a swing for them between the two
"rowan trees in the field, taking care to pack plenty of rag under the rope"
so as not to injure the tree.
He also had a talk with Paul; there were rumors that he was intending to
"take his money out of the Tore Peak resort. Paul's head was bent now, but"
he seemed even more hurt that the manufacturer should have paid a visit to
a case of a woman of her caliber gone wrong.
“But you must have read of the famous Moulton diamonds?”
"“Yes,” said Craig, blankly, as if it were all news to him."
“Schloss has them—or at least had them. The jewels she wore at the
"opera this winter were paste, I understand.”"
“Does Moulton play?” he asked.
"“I think so—but not here, naturally. In a way, I suppose, it is his"
fault. They all do it. The example of one drives on another.”
"Instantly there flashed over my mind a host of possibilities. Perhaps,"
"after all, Winters had been right. Schloss had taken this way to make"
sure of the jewels so that she could not redeem them. Suddenly another
"explanation crowded that out. Had Mrs. Moulton robbed the safe herself,"
"or hired some one else to do it for her, and had that person gone back"
on her?
Then a horrid possibility occurred to me. Whatever Antoinette Moulton
"may have been and done, some one must have her in his power. What a"
situation for the woman! My sympathy went out to her in her supreme
"struggle. Even if it had been a real robbery, Schloss might easily"
recover from it. But for her every event spelled ruin and seemed only
to be bringing that ruin closer.
"We left Winters, still watching on the trail of Schloss, and went on"
uptown to the laboratory.
"“Powder,” answered the Canon. “She has been using her puff too freely.”"
"“She has been putting it on with a _muff_,” cried Yvonne."
He laughed. Yvonne had such a triumphant air in delivering herself of
little witticisms.
"A magnificently dressed woman, in a great feathered hat and low-dress,"
"with diamonds gleaming at her neck, passed by. “You are right, I fear,"
"about the two worlds,” said the Canon."
“Are n’t there crowds of them? I like to look at them because they wear
such beautiful things. And they fit so. And then to rub shoulders with
"them makes one feel so delightfully wicked. You know, I knew a girl"
once--she went in for that life of her own accord and she was awfully
happy. Really. Is n’t it odd?”
"“My dear Yvonne!” said the Canon, somewhat shocked, “I sincerely trust"
"you did not continue the acquaintance, afterwards.”"
"“Oh, no,” she replied, sagely. “It would not have done for me at all."
A lone woman can’t be too careful. But I used to hear about her from my
dressmaker.”
Her point of view was not exactly the Canon’s. But further discussion
"was stopped by the arrival of the Wilmingtons, who carried off Yvonne"
"to the dancing-room. The Canon, drawing the line at his own appearance"
"there, strolled back contentedly to the hotel to finish the evening over"
a book.
Two mornings afterwards Yvonne was walking by herself along the _digue_.
"They were to leave for Switzerland the next day, and she determined to"
the human world or the world of nature.
When the luncheon hour drew near there came a slight lull in the
uproar.
Maxwell stood by his desk with his hands full of telegrams and
"memoranda, with a fountain pen over his right ear and his hair hanging"
"in disorderly strings over his forehead. His window was open, for the"
beloved janitress Spring had turned on a little warmth through the
waking registers of the earth.
And through the window came a wandering—perhaps a lost—odour—a
"delicate, sweet odour of lilac that fixed the broker for a moment"
"immovable. For this odour belonged to Miss Leslie; it was her own, and"
hers only.
"The odour brought her vividly, almost tangibly before him. The world of"
finance dwindled suddenly to a speck. And she was in the next
room—twenty steps away.
"“By George, I’ll do it now,” said Maxwell, half aloud. “I’ll ask her"
now. I wonder I didn’t do it long ago.”
He dashed into the inner office with the haste of a short trying to
cover. He charged upon the desk of the stenographer.
"She looked up at him with a smile. A soft pink crept over her cheek,"
and her eyes were kind and frank. Maxwell leaned one elbow on her desk.
He still clutched fluttering papers with both hands and the pen was
above his ear.
"“Miss Leslie,” he began hurriedly, “I have but a moment to spare. I"
"Colonel Carmichael thrust her behind him, and an instant later she"
heard the report of his revolver. There was no answering volley. A
"dark, scantily-clad figure sprang through the trees, waving one hand"
as though in imperative appeal.
"""Don't fire--don't fire! It's me!"""
"The Colonel's still smoking revolver sank, and the supposed native"
"swayed toward him, only to sink a few yards farther on to the ground."
Carmichael ran to his side and lifted the fainting head against his
shoulder.
"""Good God, Geoffries! Don't say I've hit you! How on earth was I to"
"know!"""
"""That's all right, Colonel. Only winded--don't you know--never hurried"
so much in life. Have been in the midst of the beggars--just managed
"to slip through. O Lor', give me something to drink, will you?"""
Colonel Carmichael put his flask to the parched and broken lips.
"""Thanks, that's better. We got your message, and are coming on like"
fun. The regiment's only an hour off. You never saw Saunders in such a
"fluster--it's his first big job, you know."" He took another deep"
"draft, and wiped his mouth with the corner of his ragged tunic. ""I"
"say--don't look at me, Miss Lois. I'm not fit to be seen."" He laughed"
"hoarsely. ""These clothes weren't made in Bond Street, and Webb assured"
"me that the fewer I had the more genuine I looked. I say, Colonel,"
"this is a lively business!"""
Colonel Carmichael nodded as he helped the gasping and exhausted man
into the bungalow.
"want you to know. I tried to keep it from you, Everard! Don’t look at me"
like that?”
Her voice ended in a note of fright. For the Canon’s face had grown
ashen and wore an expression of incredulous horror. He shook her from
him.
“Do you mean that this is true? That you met your first husband this
morning?”
"“Yes,” said she, with quivering lips. Question and answer were too"
categorical for misunderstanding. For a moment he struggled against the
overwhelming.
"“Are you in your right senses, Yvonne? Do you understand what I asked"
you? Your first husband is still alive and you saw him to-day?”
"“Yes,” said Yvonne again. “Didn’t you know when you came in?”"
"“I did n’t know,” he repeated almost mechanically."
"The blow crushed him for a while. He stood quite rigid, drawing"
"quick breaths, with his eyes fixed upon her. And she remained still,"
"half-sitting on the edge of the bed, numb with a vague prescience of"
"catastrophe, and a dim, uncomprehended intuition of the earthquake and"
wreck in the man’s soul. The silence grew appalling. She broke it with a
faltering whisper.
“Will you forgive me?”
The poor little commonplace fell in the midst of devastating
emotions--pathetically incongruous.
series of rapid flashes followed by an equal number of detonations. The
"upper air was filled with a blending of high notes--a whizzing, droning,"
"and sibilant buzzing, and pipings that died down in faint wails. The"
"little white speck moved on. It entered a film of straggling cloud, but"
soon re-emerged. It grew smaller and smaller. Our eyes lost it for a
moment and found it again. Then they lost it altogether and nothing
remained save the whitish blurs in the blue sky and a hardly audible
booming in the far distance.

"“Do you actually ask me such a question, honestly?”"
"“God knows I do,” she replied pitifully."
“And you would have gone on living with me--I not being your husband?”
"“But you are my husband,” cried Yvonne, “nothing could ever alter that.”"
"“But good God! it does alter it,” cried the Canon in a voice of anguish,"
breaking the iron bonds he had placed on his passion. “Neither in the
eyes of God nor of man are you my wife. You have no right to bear my
name. After this hour I have no right to enter this room. Every caress
"I gave you would be sin. Don’t you understand it, child? Don’t you"
"understand that this has brought ruin into our lives, the horror of"
loneliness and separation?”
“Separation?” said Yvonne.
She rose slowly from her seat on the bed and stared at him aghast.
The twilight in the room deepened; the shadow of a wall opposite the
window fell darker. Their faces and Yvonne’s bare neck and arms gleamed
white in the gloom. They had spoken with many silences; for how long
neither knew.
"“Yes,” replied the Canon in his harder tones, recovering himself “It"
means all that.”
“I am to go--not to live with you any more?”
“Could you imagine our past relations could continue?”

cannot describe how extremely dull I felt every Sunday.  I lived
"through one Sunday--it was dreadful, the second I still controlled"
"myself, the third Sunday I struck my Asok....  She was angry and"
threatened to summon me.  Just imagine if she had done so!  On the
"fourth Sunday, I beat her just as if she were my own wife!  After that"
"I gave her ten roubles, and beat her according to my own rules till I"

interrupted Abyedok.

"of St. Petersburg and died there ... of consumption they say. Ye--es,"
"there were five of them.... Ecclesiastics are prolific, you know.""  He"
"began explaining why this was so, and they laughed till they nearly"

"shall die well; and if not, then not. As a man lives so shall he die, is"
the teaching of Buddhism as of other creeds.
"So what Buddhism has to offer to the dying believer is this, that if he"
"live according to its tenets he will die happily, and that in the life"
"that he will next enter upon he will be less and less troubled by sin,"
"less and less wedded to the lust of life, until sometime, far away, he"

went before him long ago.

Sidney he admired the girl's gameness though he was beginning to wish
they had not let her come.
"""How long do you think we'll have to wait? And what if no one comes?"""
"""We'll have to wait until most morning anyway before the tide is out."
"And if no one comes tonight we'll have to come out again, that's all."
"We're not in this business for any fun!"""
"""Oh--h!"" sighed Pola, clinging closer to Sidney."
The wind howled over their heads with increasing velocity and Sidney
thought involuntarily of the snugness of Miss Letty's buggy. Miss Letty
was probably almost to Truro now. And Aunt Achsa thought she was with
her!
"""Is--is the boat tied tight?"" asked Pola; and Lav assured her that it"
"was. ""The wind could get a lot worse and you'd be as safe out here as"
"in your bed at home."""
"After a long while Mart muttered, ""What's that?"" The others leaned"
forward in the blackness of the cabin. They had all felt rather than
heard a soft thud as though something had touched the side of the boat.
And in a few moments heavy footsteps came straight toward the fo'castle.
"""Oh, will they come _here_?"" breathed Pola, shaking. And for answer"
Sidney caught Pola's arm with a warning clutch.
For an instant it seemed that the footsteps must descend to the cabin.
"But at the companionway they halted. A voice came, heavy and thick."
"""I tell you it ain't safe to take it off now. They got a man on"
"There was no one about, and a few children's faces at a window suddenly"
"disappeared. Everything here was small and poor, though only the barn was"
of peat; the house was a timbered fisherman's home. As I entered the
"house, I saw that though it was as poor within as without, the floor was"
clean and covered with pine twigs. There were many children here. The
mother was busy cooking something over the fire.
"I was offered a chair, and sitting down, began to chat with a couple of"
"small boys. As I was in no hurry and asked for nothing, the woman said:"
"""I expect you want a boat?"""
"""A boat?"" I said in my turn, for I had not come by boat on my last visit;"
I had walked instead over fjelds and valleys many miles from the sea.
"""Yes, why not?"" I said. ""But where does it go?"""
"""I thought you wanted a boat to go to the trading center,"" she replied,"
"""because that's where the steamer stops. We've rowed over lots of people"
"this year."""
Great changes here; the motor traffic in Stordalen must have completely
altered all the other traffic since my last visit ten months ago.
"""Where can I stop for a few days?"" I asked."
"""At the trading center, the other side of the islands. Or there's Eilert"
and Olaus; they're both on this side. You could go there; they've got big
"houses."""
"She showed me the two places on this side of the water, close to the"
"shore, and I proceeded thither."
Thus spoke the brave who was born and reared in the wigwams of the
tribe of the Manhattans.
"The girl, after leaving her entertainer, sped swiftly cross-town until"
"she arrived at a handsome and sedate mansion two squares to the east,"
facing on that avenue which is the highway of Mammon and the auxiliary
gods. Here she entered hurriedly and ascended to a room where a
handsome young lady in an elaborate house dress was looking anxiously
out the window.
"“Oh, you madcap!” exclaimed the elder girl, when the other entered."
“When will you quit frightening us this way? It is two hours since you
ran out in that rag of an old dress and Marie’s hat. Mamma has been so
"alarmed. She sent Louis in the auto to try to find you. You are a bad,"
thoughtless Puss.”
"The elder girl touched a button, and a maid came in a moment."
"“Marie, tell mamma that Miss Marian has returned.”"
"“Don’t scold, sister. I only ran down to Mme. Theo’s to tell her to use"
mauve insertion instead of pink. My costume and Marie’s hat were just
"what I needed. Every one thought I was a shopgirl, I am sure.”"
"“Dinner is over, dear; you stayed so late.”"
“I know. I slipped on the sidewalk and turned my ankle. I could not
"walk, so I hobbled into a restaurant and sat there until I was better."
That is why I was so long.”
"The two girls sat in the window seat, looking out at the lights and the"
"A door opened, and through it (though dimly) Rollo could see the great"
"waterfall glimmering and above the stars, chill over the snowy shoulder"
"of Peñalara. He could not make out who had opened the door, but there"
was enough light to discern that a lady wrapped in a mantilla went out
"first. Then followed another, stouter and of shorter stature, apparently"
carrying a burden. Then the whole doorway was obscured by the tall
figure of a man.
"""Muñoz himself, by Heaven!"" thought Rollo."
"And with a leap he was after him, in his headlong course dashing to the"
ground some other unseen person who confronted him in the hall.
In a moment more he had caught the tall man by the collar and swung him
impetuously round back within the doorway.
"""Move one sole inch and your blood be on your own head!"" he muttered."
"And the captive feeling Rollo's steel cold at his throat, remained"
prudently silent. Not so the lady without. She uttered a cry which rang
about the silent château.
"""Muñoz! My husband! Fernando, where art thou? Oh, they have slain him,"
"and I only am to blame!"""
"She turned about and rushed back to the door, which she was about to"
"enter, when a cry far more sudden and terrible rang out behind her."
"""_They have killed the Princess! Some one hath slain my darling!_"""
"At the word Rollo abandoned the man whom he was holding down, and with"
"shouts of ""Cardono!"" ""El Sarria!"" ""To me! They are upon us!"" he flung"
translation and they'd only have lost one day. What the hell. Use that
"as a fallback position. Time, that's all it would take, just a little"
more time.
"""But what does it matter? The game's up anyway."" He nodded toward Vera,"
"then turned to Eva, sending her a pointed signal."
"""What was it Shakespeare said about discretion and valor,"" she"
"concurred, understanding exactly what he was thinking."
"""The man knew when to fish and when to cut bait."""
"""True enough. Shall you tell them or shall I?"""
"""You can do the honors."""
"She walked over and picked up her briefcase. ""You didn't really think"
"we'd leave it, did you, Comrade? So just take it and good riddance. A"
little gift from the NSA. Who says America's getting stingy with its
"foreign aid?"""
"Comrade Karanova motioned for the two _kobun _to take the case. ""See if"
"it's there."""
"As they moved to comply, Vance found himself wondering if this really"
was going to turn off the heat. Somehow it no longer seemed adequate.
"""_Hai so_,"" he grunted through his teeth as he lifted it, ""something is"
"here."" Vance noticed that two digits of the little finger on his left"
"hand were missing, along with another digit on his ring finger. Good"

"""Take it easy,"" said Wilson, half-smiling."
"""Well, sir, we've been getting a lot of interference."""
Wilson looked up at the flickering dome. He merely nodded.
"""Well, sir--er--I was wondering if you could issue some--er--order to"
have the other ships move away? I'm sure we could find those lifeships
"if the rest of space were clear. But you've got three hundred--"""
"Wilson stared the youngster down coldly. ""Somewhere out there,"" he said"
"sourly, ""are two lifeships in which men, and a woman, are waiting for"
us to come and collect 'em. I'm combing space almost inch by inch. I
can hardly give up my squadron for a half-finished flash in the dome
"like this, can I?"""
"""No sir--ah--I suppose not."""
"""Then you live with the responses tossed back by my squadron. It'll be"
"good training for you. Er--get the hell out of my way!"""
The junior tech melted out of sight and went back to his control panel.
Weston came over within the hour. Ted Wilson explained the situation
and told Hugh to set up and measure the coordinates with respect to
the stellar centers. Then he told him to send a space scooter out to
investigate that spot.
Wilson went back to his own flagship wondering whether that fancy
infrawave detector would turn out to be anything. An untried doodad.
But now and then--
“What is it?” I asked eagerly.
"“A burglar’s microphone,” he answered, hastily looking over the"
contents of the safe. “The microphone is now used by burglars for
"picking combination locks. When you turn the lock, a slight sound is"
made when the proper number comes opposite the working point. It can be
"heard sometimes by a sensitive ear, although it is imperceptible to"
most persons. But by using a microphone it is an easy matter to hear
the sounds which allow of opening the lock.”
He had taken a yellow chamois bag out of the safe and opened it.
Inside sparkled the famous Moulton diamonds. He held them up—in all
their wicked brilliancy. No one spoke.
"Then he took another yellow bag, more dirty and worn than the first. As"
"he opened it, Mrs. Moulton could restrain herself no longer."
“The replica!” she cried. “The replica!”
"Without a word, Craig handed the real necklace to her. Then he slipped"
the paste jewels into the newer of the bags and restored both it and
"the empty one to their places, banged shut the door of the safe, and"
replaced the wooden screen.
"“Quick!” he said to her, “you have still a minute to get away."
Hurry—anywhere—away—only away!”
"The look of gratitude that came over her face, as she understood the"
full meaning of it was such as I had never seen before.
Lavender pulled up alongside of the _Arabella_ and deliberately made
the boat fast.
"""We got to act as though we haven't found the knife, y'see,"" he warned."
"""As though we were going just swimming."""
In her eagerness to board the _Arabella_ Sidney stumbled. Lavender had
to clutch her to keep her from tumbling into the water.
"""Oh!"" They both cried in one sound as they clambered to the deck--for"
the knife was gone!
"""Well, _that_ means they'd been on the _Arabella_. Jed Starrow dropped"
"that knife and he missed it and came back to look for it!"""
"""Lav, I believe they've hidden their treasure on the _Arabella_!"""
Sidney still reverted to the more romantic terms of buccaneering.
"""Let's look for it now!"""
"""With 'em watching maybe from the _Puritan_? I guess not. We got to go"
"ahead and swim the way we always do, Sid. Don't let's even appear to be"
"talking about anything. Come on, I'll beat you in!"""
For the space of the few minutes while the water closed about her with
delicious coolness Sidney forgot everything in an intoxication of
delight. Presently she came back to the _Arabella_ and climbed aboard
"with a sigh of utter content. ""Thank goodness _I_ haven't any"
"complexes,"" she laughed, shaking the salt drops from her bobbed head."
"""And now what?"""
Lavender pulled on the light sweater he had worn over his bathing suit.
"“What kind of a lady was Miss Sprowls—in looks, I mean?”"
"“Why, black-haired, sir, short, and stout, with a comical face. They"
left a week ago Tuesday.”
“And before they occupied it?”
"“Why, there was a single gentleman connected with the draying business."
He left owing me a week. Before him was Missis Crowder and her two
"children, that stayed four months; and back of them was old Mr. Doyle,"
whose sons paid for him. He kept the room six months. That goes back a
"year, sir, and further I do not remember.”"
He thanked her and crept back to his room. The room was dead. The
essence that had vivified it was gone. The perfume of mignonette had
"departed. In its place was the old, stale odour of mouldy house"
"furniture, of atmosphere in storage."
"The ebbing of his hope drained his faith. He sat staring at the yellow,"
singing gaslight. Soon he walked to the bed and began to tear the
sheets into strips. With the blade of his knife he drove them tightly
into every crevice around windows and door. When all was snug and taut
"he turned out the light, turned the gas full on again and laid himself"
gratefully upon the bed.
It was Mrs. McCool’s night to go with the can for beer. So she fetched
it and sat with Mrs. Purdy in one of those subterranean retreats where
house-keepers foregather and the worm dieth seldom.
"“I rented out my third floor, back, this evening,” said Mrs. Purdy,"
almost a cry for help. She was growing old and soured and worn by
"perpetual conjugal wranglings. John, her kinsman, counted for a great"
deal in a life none too rich. John and Stella were nearest to her in the
"world--first Stella, naturally, then John. To the woman of over fifty"
the man of under thirty is still a boy. For many years she had nursed
the two together in her heart. And now he was going from her. What
"would she, what would Stella, do without him? Her husband's direct"
interpellation aroused her from her reverie.
"“Julia, what was the name of the chap we met in St. Kitts who had been"
sheep-farming in Queensland?”
They had sailed away from St. Kitts in 1878. Lady Blount reminded
him tartly of the fact while professing her oblivion of the man from
Queensland. They sparred for a few moments. Then she rose wearily and
said she was going to bed. Sir Oliver looked at his watch.
“Nearly twelve. Time for us all to go.”
"“As soon as I' ve written my morning letter to Stellamaris,” said"
Herold.
"“I must write, too,” said Risca."
For it was a rule of the house that every visitor should write
"Stellamaris a note overnight, to be delivered into her hands the first"
thing in the morning. The origin of the rule was wrapped in the mists of
history.
So John Risca sat down at Sir Oliver's study-table in order to indite
his letter to Stellamaris. But for a long time he stared at the white
"paper. He, the practised journalist, who could dash off his thousand"
worth while to add that the next suite was his own.
"""A thousand pardons,"" repeated M. Dubois, very penitently. ""I am too"
stupid! But mademoiselle will perhaps be so gracious as to forgive me
"this time."""
"He bowed to Sallie again and to Slyne, and disappeared, sharply scanning"
the latter's face to the last.
"""Who's that son of a sea-cook?"" snapped Captain Dove, and Mr. Jobling"
looked wanly up out of one eye.
"""A French detective,"" Slyne answered reflectively. But Sallie felt sure"
"that he was afraid of M. Dubois, and wondered why."
"""Well, he has nothing against me that I'm aware of,"" the old man"
"declared. ""And now--what about this wire? Does it mean that some other"
fellow has scooped the pool--and that I've had all my trouble for
"nothing, eh?"" He clenched his fist again and shook it in the lawyer's"
face.
"""No, no,"" gasped Mr. Jobling. ""Don't be so hasty. It makes no difference"
"at all, now that we have Lady Josceline with us. I told you that the"
"American, Carthew, is of no account against her--and how he has ever"
"cropped up again I can't conceive. In any case--"""
"""In any case, you'd better be off to your room and ring for a bit of"
"beefsteak to doctor that eye with,"" Slyne interposed in a tone of"
intense annoyance.
"""And I wish to goodness, Dove!"" he added savagely, ""that you would"
"behave a little more like a reasonable human being and less--"""
"""I do not speak of these men, I am thinking of Judas Petunikoff, who is"
"one of them...."""
"""And you say you have nothing to do with them?"" asks the teacher,"
quietly.
"""But do you think that I do not live?  Aha!  I do live, but I suppose I"
ought not to be angry at the fact that life is desecrated and robbed of
"all freedom by these men."""
"""And they dare to laugh at the kindly anger of the Captain, a man"
"living in retirement?"" says Abyedok, teasingly."
"""Very well!  I agree with you that I am foolish.  Being a creature who"
"was once a man, I ought to blot out from my heart all those feelings"
"that once were mine.  You may be right, but then how could I or any of"
"you defend ourselves if we did away with all these feelings?"""
"""Now then, you are talking sense,"" says the teacher, encouragingly."
"""We want other feelings and other views on life.... We want something"
"new ... because we ourselves are a novelty in this life...."""
"""Doubtless this is most important for us,"" remarks the teacher."
"""Why?"" asks Kanets.  ""Is it not all the same whatever we say or think?"
"We have not got long to live ...  I am forty, you are fifty ... there"
"is no one among us younger than thirty, and even at twenty one cannot"
"live such a life long."""
"""And what kind of novelty are we?"" asked Abyedok, mockingly."
"The boys remained perfectly silent, then, and listened. There seemed to"
"be several men in the chamber below, and two were talking in angry"
"tones. There were plenty of torches below, too, for the red flare and"
the stink of them came into the boys’ hiding place by way of the
fire-niche below. This is what the boys heard:
"“You can see for yourself, Huga,” a voice which Ned recognized as that"
"of Toombs, was saying, “that the boy is not here.”"
“But I am certain I heard footsteps running in this direction when I
stood in the darkness before you men came in!” Huga answered. “He must
be in this chamber somewhere.”
“Look for yourself!” Toombs advised crossly.
“Isn’t there some hiding place in the walls?” asked Huga.
"Ned nudged Jimmie as they heard this, and both moved farther back in the"
hiding place. It will be understood how intently they listened for the
next sentence.
"“You ought to know that,” Toombs answered; “you are supposed to know all"
"about this old mission, while I am fresh from Wall street.”"
“I have never heard of any secret passage or room in this part of the
"excavation,” the half-breed replied."
“Then stop arguing that the boy is here!” roared Toombs.
"Huga made no reply, but the boys heard him poking about in the"
fireplace. Presently a light flashed into the chimney.
"uprooting of all your habits,” said he, in a softened voice."
"She smiled. “I can bring them with me,” she said cheerfully. “You won't"
"mind Dandy, will you? He'll soon get used to you. And as for Dickie,”"
"she added, with a touch of wistfulness, “I 'm sure I can find a nice"
home for him.”
John put his arm round her shoulder and gave her the kiss of a shy bear.
"“My good soul,” he cried, “bring fifty million Dickies if you like.” He"
laughed. “There's nothing like the song of birds for the humanizing of
the cockney child.”
"He looked around and beheld the little, gimcrack room with a new vision."
"After all, it was as much an expression of her individuality, and as"
"genuine in the eyes of the high gods, as Herold's exquisitely furnished"
"abode was of Herold's, or the untidy jumble of the room in Fenton Square"
was of his own. And all she had to live upon was a hundred and fifty
"pounds a year, and no artistic instincts or antecedents whatsoever."
“I feel a brute in asking you to give up this little place now that
"you've made it so pretty,” he said."
"Her face brightened at the praise. “It is pretty, is n't it?” Then she"
sighed as her eyes rested fondly on her possessions. “I suppose it would
be too tiny for us all to live here.”
"“I'm afraid it would,” said John. “Besides, we must live in London, on"
account of my work.”
“In London?”
"“We might begin,” replied John, “with more elementary accomplishments.”"
"“I could teach her botany,” said Miss Lindon, pensively. “I got first"
"prize for it at school. I still have the book in a cupboard, and I"
could read it up. And I'm so glad I have kept my two volumes of pressed
"flowers. It's quite easy to learn, I assure you.”"
"“I'm afraid, my dear,” said John, “you 'll first have to teach her to"
"eat and drink like a Christian, and blow her nose, and keep her face"
clean.”
"“Ah, that reminds me. My head's in a maze, and I can't think of"
"everything at once, like some clever people. What kind of soap do"
"gentlemen use? I 'll have to know, so as to supply you with what you"
like.”
"“Any old stuff that will make a lather,” said John, rising."
"“But some soaps are so bad for the skin,” she objected anxiously."
“Vitriol would n't hurt my rhinoceros hide.”
"He laughed, and held out his hand. Further discussion was useless."
Miss Lindon accompanied him to the front gate and watched him stride
down the perky terrace until he disappeared round the corner. Then she
"went slowly into the house and uncovered the canary, who blinked at her"
"in oblique sullenness, and did not respond to her friendly “cheep” and"
the scratching of her finger against the rails of his cage. She turned
"to Dandy, who, snoring loud, was equally unresponsive. Feeling lonely"
"and upset, she rang the bell."
Suddenly a postmark on one of the letters on the little table at her
elbow caught her eye. Provincetown. Trude caught it up apprehensively.
That letter might be from their Cousin Achsa! She turned it over and
"over, wishing she might open it."
"""Good morning, my dear! I get up with the birds myself and find that"
"you're up before me!"""
"Trude laughed, to cover her anxiety. ""I told Jonathan I'd inspect his"
"new beds this morning."""
"""There, didn't I say you were supplanting me in Jonathan's esteem? But"
he only wants you to admire them and smile at him. He knows you know
"nothing about gardens, even though you are a very wise young woman! Ah,"
"the mail--is there anything there worth looking at before breakfast?"""
"""Two cards, three advertising envelopes and--and two personal letters."""
"Trude held out the two letters, her heart beating in her throat."
Mrs. White glanced at them indifferently. She turned one as though to
"tear open the envelope, then stopped to play with Mitie. Next she gave"
her attention to Pepper who appeared in the door to summon her to
breakfast. And all the time Trude's eyes were beseeching her to open
them--to open _one_ of them quickly.
Trude followed her into the breakfast room and sat down across from
her. After she had eaten her fruit Mrs. White took up the envelope that
was postmarked Provincetown and studied it while Trude waited.
"""Why, that's from Laura Craig--a cousin of mine. I remember now she"
said she was going to study in a summer school on Cape Cod. I hope the
“Is this the Velázquez portrait?” asked Cæsar.
“This is it.”
Cæsar looked at it carefully. “That man had eaten and drunk well before
"his portrait was painted,” said Cæsar; “his face is congested.”"
"“It is extraordinary!” exclaimed Cortés. “It is something to see, the"
"way this is done. What boldness! Everything is red, the cape, the cap,"
the curtains in the background.... What a man!”
"The German aired his opinions in his own language, and took out a"
notebook and pencil and wrote some notes.
"“What sort of man was this?” asked Cæsar, whom the technical side of"
"painting did not preoccupy, as it did Cortés."
"“They say he was a dull man, who lived under a woman’s domination.”"
"“The great thing is,” murmured Cæsar, “how the painter has left him"
"here alive. It seems as if we had come in here to salute him, and he"
was waiting for us to speak. Those clear eyes are questioning us. It is
curious.”
"“Not curious,” exclaimed Cortés, “but admirable.”"
“For me it is more curious than admirable. There is something brutal in
"this Pope; through his grey beard, which is so thin, you can see his"
"projecting chin. The good gentleman was of a marked prognathism, a type"
"of degeneration, indifference, intellectual torpor, and nevertheless, he"
"reached the top. Perhaps in the Church it’s the same as in water, only"
corks float.”
"enough wisdom and courage to put this matter before the people?"""
"""Young man, I am not going to pass judgment on anyone in Washington or"
"elsewhere. Each of us, I'm sure, does his duty as he sees it."""
Again it seemed to Senator Crane that he heard a ripple of mirth--louder
this time. It had to be something to do with the acoustics. Except that
"he was suddenly aware of smiles, too. The next question had to do with"
possible consultation with Russia on the matter of the coming space
invasion.
Senator Crane agreed that such consultation should be made and then
retired hastily into seclusion. A touch of panic hit him. He felt like a
"man who was far out in the water without a boat, with the closest land a"
few hundred feet straight down. Good God! Had he miscalculated? Of
course not. He had only to await the verdict of the nation's top
newspapers before proceeding with the publicity program that might well
make him presidential timber.

"John Dennis, for the first time since Rhoda had known him, seemed"
nervous. He kept licking his lips and shifting his eyes from Rhoda to
Frank Corson.
"Frank Corson sat quietly, keeping his thoughts to himself. Rhoda crossed"
to the liquor cabinet and poured a double Scotch. She went to the sofa
and sat down a little uncertainly.
"""I guess you two haven't met. John, this is Frank Corson."""
"John Dennis paid no attention. He walked to the sofa, sat down, and took"
raining. He was a proud and comical sight. But why speak harsh words about
"a raincoat? It was not he, the owner, that had abused it, and it hung from"
his shoulders as innocently as a bridal veil.
"Why speak harsh words about anyone? Life is good, but life is stern."
"Perhaps when she comes out, I think to myself, the following scene will"
take place: I stand here waiting only for this departure. So she gives me
her hand and says good-bye.
"""Why don't you say something?"" she asks in order to seem bright and easy"
in her mind.
"""Because I don't want to hurt you in the great error of your ways."""
"""Ha, ha, ha,"" she laughs, too loudly and in a forced tone; ""the great"
"error of my ways! Well, really!"""
"And her anger grows, while I am assured and fatherly, standing on the firm"
ground of conscious virtue. Yet I say an unworthy thing like this:
"""Don't throw yourself away, Miss Torsen!"""
"She raises her head then; yes, the Torsen type would raise her head and"
"reply, pale and offended:"
"""Throw myself away?--I don't understand you."""
"But it is possible, too, that Miss Torsen, at heart a fine, proud girl,"
would have a lucid moment and see things in their true light:
"""Why not, why shouldn't I throw myself away? What is there to keep? I am"
"thrown away, wasted ever since my school days, and now I am seven and"
"_do_ you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?"""
*       *       *       *       *
"He cocked his head and considered a moment. ""Look,"" he said finally,"
"""I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I"
couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all
the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the _Eleanor
Roosevelt_ because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine
and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat--don't you know that
every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs?
"Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?"""
"""Yes,"" she said bitterly. ""You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you."
I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him
"equally guilty?"""
"""No, Sis, he didn't,"" I was beginning to argue. ""All he wanted--"""
"""Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be"
"sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences."""
"""Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?"""
"He waved his hands at her impatiently. ""I'm not talking law, female;"
I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to
look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your
"way to Venus for a husband. So let's."""
"Sis actually staggered back. ""Let's? Let's _what_? Are--are you daring"
"to suggest that--that--"""
We were in a narrow passage leading to the Stone Gallery in Whitehall. He
"looked about him a moment, then taking me by the arm, led me to the Stone"
"Gallery and thence to the garden. I wanted to stop, but he kept his grasp"
"on my arm, repeating now and then the word ""Come"" in whispers, till we"
"reached a lonely spot in St. James Park. There he halted, and though"
"there was not a living creature in sight, he brought his lips to my ear"
"and breathed the name, ""'Sieur George Hamilton."""
"I tried not to show that I was startled, but the quickwitted, sharp-eyed"
"Frenchman read me as though I were an open book, and grasping my hand,"
cried out:--
"""Ah, I knew you could tell me. It is to rejoice! I knew it!"""
"""Tell you what, count?"" I asked."
"""Tell me where your friend and mine is, or if you will not tell me, take"
"to him a letter. I have been trying to find him this fortnight."""
"""I cannot tell you where he is, my dear count--"""
"""Of course not! I do not ask,"" he interrupted."
"""--But I may be able to forward your letter to him. I heard only the"
"other day that he was in France."""
"""Of course, of course, he is in France! Not in England at all! Good,"
good! I see you are to be trusted. But I must have your word of honor
"that the letter will be delivered."""
"""I shall send it by none but a trusted messenger,"" I answered, ""and shall"
return it to you unopened unless I am convinced beyond a doubt that it
"Understand?"""
"Viggon Sarri looked from one to the other, grimly. ""You believe I'm"
"wasting time? Is that it?"""
"The two aides answered together, ""Yes!"" and ""Absolutely!"""
"Viggon Sarri said, ""I am still in command of this force. We'll continue"
to observe until I am satisfied. You two officers have one common
idea--that of moving in fast. You have differing ideas of how we are
to move in. Until you can settle your difference and provide me with a
good logical basis for your decision--whichever way--then we'll follow
my plan. And my plan is to move in just as soon as we have enough data
on the character and strength of this race to provide us with the
"correct way to take them."""
"""Then you are going to continue stalling?"" demanded Naylo."
"""Yes, if you wish to call it stalling. Maybe another man might call it"
"planning."""
"""We'll be just wasting time, as I've already said. We have enough stuff"
"to take 'em right now."""
"Viggon Sarri shrugged. ""Yes. We could swoop in and take them like"
"mowing down a wheat field. Tell me, young men, what happens when you"
"mow down a wheat field."""
They looked at him blankly.
"Viggon smiled in a superior manner. ""One of two things, depending upon"
"how you operate. If you mow it down and let it lay, you drop seeds and"
"""He isn't even thinking of coming, the wretch! ..."""
"""That means that he does not love me!"" sang Deacon Taras, leaning his"
chin on his hand and casting a humorous glance towards the mountain.
At last Petunikoff appeared.  He came in a respectable cart with his
"son playing the role of groom.  The latter was a red-checked,"
"nice-looking youngster, in a long square-cut overcoat.  He wore smoked"
"eyeglasses.  They tied the horse to an adjoining tree, the son took the"
"measuring instrument out of his pocket and gave it to his father, and"
they began to measure the ground.  Both were silent and worried.
"""Aha!"" shouted the Captain, gleefully."
All those who were in the dosshouse at the moment came out to look at
them and expressed themselves loudly and freely in reference to the
matter.
"""What does the habit of thieving mean?  A man may sometimes make a big"
"mistake when he steals, standing to lose more than he gets,"" said the"
"Captain, causing much laughter among his staff and eliciting various"
murmurs of assent.
"""Take care, you devil!"" shouted Petunikoff, ""lest I have you in the"
"police court for your words!"""
"""You can do nothing to me without witnesses ...  Your son cannot give"
"evidence on your side"" ... the Captain warned him."
"""Look out all the same, you old wretch, you may be found guilty too!"""
"And Petunikoff shook his fist at him. His son, deeply engrossed in his"
"half the listeners, had known the lady as Mrs. Medland."
"""No,"" said Mr. Medland; ""I lost sight of him."""
"""You did not hear from--from any one about him?"""
"""No."""
He gave the dates when he had last seen Benyon in old days. Asked
whether he had communicated with him between that date and the dead
"man's reappearance, he answered,"
"""Once, about four years ago. I wrote to tell him of that lady's death,"""
"and he pointed again to the picture, and went on to tell the details of"
Benyon's subsequent application to him for a post under Government.
"""You refused it?"" he was asked."
"""Yes, I refused it. I spoke to him once again, when we met on a social"
occasion. We had a sort of dispute then. I never saw him again to speak
"to."""
"""It was all done,"" said Mr. Duncombe, describing the scene, ""in a"
repressed way that was very effective--to a house that knew the
circumstances most effective. And the other fellow--Kilshaw--he gave
"some sport too. The coroner (they told me he was one of Medland's men,"
and I noticed he spared Medland all he could) was inclined to be a bit
"down on Kilshaw. Kilshaw was cool and handy in his answers, but, Lord"
love you! his game came out pretty plain. A monkey! You don't give a man
"a monkey unless there's value received! So people saw, and Mr. Kilshaw"
looked a bit uncomfortable when he caught Medland's eye. He looked at
"him like that,"" and Mr. Duncombe assumed the finest wronged-hero glance"
Before Peters could reply the red-haired man took a single step forward
and faced Bob.
"“I can tell you in two shakes of a lamb’s tail,” he snapped viciously."
"“This river hog o’ yours thinks he kin play the devil with my boom, but"
he’s got another guess comin’. I own this land an’ that sawmill. I got a
right to run my booms out in the river same as anybody else. I ain’t
"lookin’ for trouble, but the first man as tries any monkey business"
"wants to look out, that’s all.”"
"Bainbridge raised his eyebrows, and let his gaze wander leisurely from"
the man’s head to his heels with an expression which brought an added
touch of color to the already flushed cheeks.
“Indeed!” he drawled. “Who are you?”
“Who be I?” retorted the other angrily. “Humph! I don’t see that it
"makes no difference, but my name’s Joyce--John Joyce. An’ I ain’t the"
"kind as backs down an’ takes water, believe me!”"
A singularly irritating smile curved the corners of Bob’s lips. His
"unruffled composure served, as he hoped it might, to increase the rage"
of Mr. Joyce.
“Do you realize that you’re obstructing navigation?” he inquired
suavely.
"“I don’t admit it,” snapped Joyce. “There’s plenty of room for your"
"drive to git past if you had a gang that knew their business, instead of"
a lot o’ greenhorns.”
"“I dare say you could give us all points,” Bainbridge murmured smoothly,"
"through."""
"She nodded, then stepped over and laid her weapon beside the bundles of"
securities. Vance took one last look at the Smith & Wesson in his own
hand and did the same. Even ex-archaeologists could do arithmetic.
All this time Vera Karanova had said nothing. She merely stood watching
"the proceedings with a detached smile. Finally she spoke. ""Now we can"
"proceed with the counting,"" she said calmly."
"""Maybe you don't fully grasp the situation here, comrade."" Vance stared"
"at her. ""Those gorillas aren't dropping in for tea. We've got to stand"
"together."""
"She burst out laughing. ""Mr. Vance, you are truly naive. No, you're"
worse. You actually thought you could sabotage the most powerful new
"global alliance of the twentieth century."" Her dark eyes were gradually"
"turning glacial. ""It will not be allowed to happen, believe me."""
"My God, he realized, that's why she wanted to get her hands on the"
"protocol. To deep-six it. She's been biding her time, stringing us"
along. And today she managed to stall us long enough for Mino's boys to
figure out the switch. She's no longer working for T-Directorate; she's
part of Tanzan Mino's operation. All this time she's been working with
them.
"""The negotiable certificates in this room will be delivered to their"
"rightful recipient by his personal jet,"" she continued. ""Today."""
"""Over my dead body."" He found himself thinking it might well be true."
"""No, Mr. Vance, not exactly. Your contribution will be more substantial"

"Sis nodded to herself, waved the door open, and walked out."
"""Let's hope,"" the Captain said. ""Like any father used to say, a man who"
"knows how to handle women, how to get around them without their knowing"
"it, doesn't need to know anything else in this life. I'm plain wasted"
"in space. You can lower your hands now, son."""
We sat down and I explained the blaster to him. He was very interested.
He said all Butt had told him--in the lifeboat when they decided to
use my arrest as a club over Sis--was to keep the safety catch all the
way up against his thumb. I could see he really had been excited about
"carrying a lethal weapon around. He told me that back in the old days,"
"captains--sea captains, that is--actually had the right to keep guns"
in their cabins all the time to put down mutinies and other things our
ancestors did.
"The telewall flickered, and we turned it on. Sis smiled down."
"""Everything's all right, Captain. Come up and marry us, please."""
"""What did you stick him for?"" he asked. ""What was the price?"""
"Sis's full lips went thin and hard, the way Mom's used to. Then she"
"thought better of it and laughed. ""Mr. Brown is going to see that I'm"
"elected sheriff of the Galertan Archipelago."""
"""And I thought she'd settle for a county clerkship!"" the Captain"
muttered as we spun up to the brig.
The doors were open and girls were chattering in every corner. Sis came
up to the Captain to discuss arrangements. I slipped away and found
"""With gratitude,"
"""Your friend,"
"""LE BLANC."""
"I sought Frances, and when I told her the substance of George's letter,"
she was almost wild with joy.
"""Am I willing to try?"" she exclaimed, laughing while tears were hanging"
"in her eyes. ""I am not only willing to try, but am determined to succeed."
"Ay, I'd sell England itself in the same cause. Of all the men I have ever"
"known, this king of ours is the greatest dupe. Since the return of the"
"court to Whitehall, he has been growing more importunate every day. He"
"seems to have lost what little wits he had, and does and says the"
"silliest things one can imagine."""
"""And you do not fear attempting to lead him on to sell Dunkirk? You do"
"not fear going too near the precipice?"" I asked, wishing to weigh her"
self-confidence more by the manner of her reply than by her words.
"She laughed and answered: ""There is no precipice, cousin Ned; nothing to"
"fear save kidnapping, and I am always guarded against that danger;"
"nothing to do of which I need feel ashamed, save the acting of a lie, and"
"surely one may lie to the father of lies without sin."""
"""But the lie may be recognized,"" I suggested, ""if one be too bold about"
"it."""
"""My lie will go little beyond a smile or two. The king's vanity will do"
"the rest. He will make himself believe that I mean more than I say."""
"""To please me."""
Mr. Wagge's readjusted glance stopped in confusion at her waist. He
"answered, in a voice that he strove to make bland:"
"""If you put it in that way, I don't reelly know 'ow to refuse; but it"
"must be quite between you and me--I can't withdraw my attitude."""
Gyp murmured:
"""No, of course.  Thank you so much; and you'll let me know about"
"everything later.  I mustn't take up your time now.""  And she held out"
her hand.
Mr. Wagge took it in a lingering manner.
"""Well, I HAVE an appointment,"" he said; ""a gentleman at Campden Hill.  He"
"starts at twelve.  I'm never late.  GOOD-morning."""

"But Mrs. Warren said it was no distance, only round the corner, and"
she could well walk. When they got back she would go and lie down.
"Vivie, reading her mother's thoughts, pressed a five-franc note into"

But just as they were passing through the revolving door of the

"_kobun_ instantly reached for his holstered Llama, but by then Kenji"
"Nogami had moved, seizing him and momentarily pinning his arms with a"
powerful embrace.
"For her own part, Eva had lunged for Vera and her purse, to neutralize"
"the Walther she carried. Comrade Karanova, however, had already"
"anticipated everything. She whisked back the purse, then plunged her"
"hand in. What she withdrew, though, was not a pistol but a shiny"
cylindrical object made of glass.
"It was three against three, a snapshot of desperation."
"We've got a chance, Vance thought. Keep him down. And get the Llama."
"As the _kobun_ tried to rise, gasping, Vance threw himself over the"
"upturned chair, reaching to pin the man's arms. With a bear-like"
"embrace he had him, the body small and muscular in his arms. Out of the"
corner of his eye he saw Kenji Nogami still grappling with the other
"_kobun_. The computer now lay on the floor, open and askew."
"Where's Eva? He tried to turn and look for her, but there was no sound"
to guide him. Then the _kobun_ wrenched free one arm and brought a fist
"against the side of his face, diverting him back to matters at hand."
Hold him down. Just get the gun.
"He tried to crush his larger frame against the other's slim body,"
forcing the air out of him. Focus.
"Then, after an interminable time, Miss Craig called out cheerily;"
"""There, that's enough for this morning,"" and came down to the dory,"
opening a little crocheted bag. From it she took two crisp one dollar
"bills. ""Take this, girls, and divide it. And we are ever so"
"grateful--you were splendid types. We'll have you again some day."""
Sidney's hand had barely closed over her dollar bill when she spied a
"woman and a girl slowly walking along the wharf, watching with interest"
the artists who were still at work. The girl looked startlingly
familiar to Sidney. She gave a little gasp and ran forward.
"""_Pola!_"" she called loudly."
"The girl turned in astonishment at the sound of her name, stared for a"
"moment, then quickly advanced laughing."
"""Why, you're the Romley girl, aren't you? Of _all_ the things! What are"
"you doing here?"""
"""I'm visiting my aunt,"" explained Sidney, suddenly conscious of her"
appearance and in consequence painfully ill-at-ease.
"""Oh, and do they hire you to pose? What fun! I suppose that's a sort of"
"costume they make you wear, isn't it?"""
"""Y--yes,"" Sidney faltered, miserably. Pola's manner was prettily"
condescending and she made no move to join Sidney on the beach.
"""I'm a wreck myself,"" Pola went on, airily surveying her trim and"
"elegant person. ""Mother and I are motoring. And I made her bring me"
down here to see my cousin. He's an artist and lives here summers.
He'll just despise seeing us because he comes here to get rid of
"""Well, here goes for food!"" he said, as though he were going to require"
all his energy for the task of eating.
Why had she written? There was nothing to prevent her speaking to him. He
"had, after all, been sitting on the doorstep when she emerged from her"
room and passed him. Had she foreseen that the good comedian could not
"contain himself, but would surely let a third person into the secret?"
"Why probe or question further? The actor did not eat much, but he looked"
"very happy. So the note must have said yes, must have been a promise;"
perhaps she would not tantalize him further.
XXV
"A few days later, they were going to leave. They would travel together,"
and that would be the end.
"I might have pitied them both, for though life is good, life is stern. One"
"result at any rate was accomplished. She had not sent for him in vain, nor"
had he come in vain.
That was the end of the act. But there were more acts to come--many more.
"She had lost much: having been ravished, she gave herself away; why be"
"niggardly now? And this is the destiny of her type, that they lose"
"increasingly much, retaining ever less; what need to hold back now? The"
ground has been completely shifted: from half-measures to the immolation
But the wiry man was stronger than he looked. With a twist he rolled
over and pinned Vance's shoulders against the carpet. Vance felt the
"shag, soft against his skin, and couldn't believe how chilly it felt."
"But now he had his hand on the _kobun's_ throat, holding him in a"
powerful grip while jamming a free elbow against the holster.
Cut off his oxygen. Don't let him breathe.
"The old moves were coming back, the shortcuts that would bring a more"
powerful opponent to submission. He pressed a thumb against the man's
"windpipe, shutting off his air. A look of surprise went through the"
"_kobun's_ eyes as he choked, letting his hold on Vance's shoulders"
slacken.
Now.
He shoved the man's arm aside and reached for the holster. Then his
hand closed around the hard grip of the Llama. The Japanese was weaker
"now, but still forcing his arm away from the gun, preventing him from"
getting the grip he needed.
"He rammed an elbow against the man's chin, then tightened his finger on"
the grip of the Llama. He almost had it.
"With his other hand he shoved the _kobun_'s face away, clawing at his"
"eyes, and again they rolled over, with the Japanese once more against"
the carpet. But now he had the gun and he was turning.
"He felt a sharp jab in his back, a flash of pain that seemed to come"
"from nowhere. It was both intense and numbing, as though his spine had"
"been caught in a vise. Then he felt his heart constrict, his"
difficult to make out whether the men had left the boat or not. Once
Lav crawled to the top of the companion ladder but a muttering like a
human voice drove him back. Queer sounds struck upon their sensitized
ears. And the boat seemed to lift to a new motion.
They waited for an interminable time. Then Mart spoke quickly.
"""Lav, we're moving!"""
"Lav needed no warning. He, too, had missed the pull of the boat on the"
anchor rope. He shot up the ladder.
"""Oh, what's the matter?"" cried Sidney and Pola, forgetting all caution."
"Mart had no time to explain her fears. In an instant Lav was back,"
fairly throwing himself into the cabin.
"""We're drifting! They cut the anchor rope! We're drifting out! Fast!"
"Way out! To sea!"""
"That had been the ""better scheme."" To cut the _Arabella_ free from its"
mooring and let the wind and tide carry it out into the bay. At first
Starrow had not favored the plan; he had declared that it was too much
"risk, that the wind was shifting and freshening fast and that the old"
"tub might open a seam, but Joe Josephs had convinced him with: ""the"
_Arabella_ would be good for a week out in a nastier sea than this.
It's safer than riskin' runnin' afoul one of Phin Davies' men ashore.
Guthrie's _Sally_'ll stand this squall and pick up the _Arabella_ easy
"and we can reckon sure on the course the old tub'll take, even 'lowin'"
"for the wind to shift."""
As she comprehended what had happened Pola screamed. Mart and Sidney
"There young Charles was waiting for him. Carefully, as though"
"everything depended on it, he was tucking a towel round the hot-water"
can. Young Charles had been a favourite of his ever since as a little
red-faced boy he had come into the house to look after the fires. Old
"Mr. Neave lowered himself into the cane lounge by the window, stretched"
"out his legs, and made his little evening joke, “Dress him up,"
"Charles!” And Charles, breathing intensely and frowning, bent forward"
to take the pin out of his tie.
"H’m, h’m! Well, well! It was pleasant by the open window, very"
pleasant—a fine mild evening. They were cutting the grass on the tennis
court below; he heard the soft churr of the mower. Soon the girls would
begin their tennis parties again. And at the thought he seemed to hear
"Marion’s voice ring out, “Good for you, partner.... Oh, _played_,"
"partner.... Oh, _very_ nice indeed.” Then Charlotte calling from the"
"veranda, “Where is Harold?” And Ethel, “He’s certainly not here,"
"mother.” And Charlotte’s vague, “He said—”"
"Old Mr. Neave sighed, got up, and putting one hand under his beard, he"
"took the comb from young Charles, and carefully combed the white beard"
"over. Charles gave him a folded handkerchief, his watch and seals, and"
spectacle case.
"“That will do, my lad.” The door shut, he sank back, he was alone...."
And now that little ancient fellow was climbing down endless flights
"that led to a glittering, gay dining-room. What legs he had! They were"
"like a spider’s—thin, withered."
"“You’re an ideal family, sir, an ideal family.”"
"But if that were true, why didn’t Charlotte or the girls stop him? Why"
"hands and arms a long pair of motoring doeskin gloves. By George, she"
"was a winner—in general looks, though. Well, something about the clerk,"
"I suppose, must have aroused her suspicions. For, a moment later, she"
was gone in the crowd. Evidently she had thought of the danger and had
picked out a time when the lobby would be full and everybody busy. But
she did not leave by the front entrance through which she entered. I
concluded that she must have left by one of the side street carriage
doors.”
“And she got away?”
“Yes. I found that she asked one of the boys at the door to crank up a
"car standing at the curb. She slid into the seat, and was off in a"
minute.”
Kennedy said nothing. But I knew that he was making a mighty effort to
restrain comment on the bungling amateur detective work of the son of
our client.
"Reginald saw the look on his face. “Still,” he hastened, “I got the"
number of the car. It was 200859 New York.”
“You have looked it up?” queried Kennedy quickly.
“I didn’t need to do it. A few minutes later Dr. Rae Wilson herself
came out—storming like mad. Her car had been stolen at the very door of
the hotel by this woman with the innocent aid of the hotel employees.”
Kennedy was evidently keenly interested. The mention of the stolen car
had apparently at once suggested an idea to him.
"“Mrs. Blake,” he said, as he rose to go, “I shall take this letter with"
the bottom a la log.
“Here we go!” shouted Frank.
The boys raced along the slope until they came to a point of timber
"which, following a more fertile spot, thrust itself up the ascent. Here"
"they disappeared, considering themselves reasonably safe in the"
seclusion of the forest. Frank examined his gun and found it empty.
“Good thing that dub didn’t know it was empty!” he laughed.
“Don’t stop now to throw bouquets at yourself!” grinned Harry.
“That’s right!” Jack declared. “We want to be getting back to the camp.
Gilroy’ll have a fit if he wakes up and finds us gone.”
"“Don’t you ever think those half-breeds will give up the chase here,”"
"Frank suggested. “Do you know what they’ll do?” he asked, “They’ll"
circle around and get between us and the camp! That’s what they’ll do.”
"“I sometimes think,” Harry snorted, turning to Jack, “that Frank is"
getting so intelligent that he may have the gift of speech conferred
upon him. He certainly has that proposition right.”
"“Well, if we can’t go back to camp,” Jack asked, “where can we go?”"
“We’ll have to glide into some gentle dell in the bosom of a friendly
"hill!” laughed Harry, “and send a scout out to watch those fellows spy"
upon the camp.”
“If they’ve got a detachment of half-breeds guarding every squad of Boy
"Scouts that have strayed away from the camp today,” Jack laughed, “they"
"“I don’t understand,” she began feebly. And then the darkness fell upon"
"her, and her limbs relaxed. She swayed sideways and would have fallen,"
but he caught her in his arms and laid her on the couch.
"“Thank you,” she murmured faintly."
"She hid her face in her hands and remained, crouched up, quite still, in"
"a stupor of misery. The Canon stood over her helplessly, unable to find"
a word of comfort.
The sight of her prostration did not move him. He had been wounded to
"the very depths of his being. His pride, his honour, his dignity were"
lacerated in their vitals. He burned with the sense of unpardonable
wrong.
"“It is self-evident,” he said at last, “that we must part. Our remaining"
together would be a sin against God and an outrage upon Society.”
"She rased herself wearily, with one hand on the couch, and shook her"
head slowly.
“Such things are beyond me. No one will ever know.”
"“There is One who will always know, Yvonne.”"
"She pondered over the saying, as far as her tired, bewildered brain"
allowed. It conveyed very little meaning to her. Theology had not
altered her child-like conception of the benevolence of the Creator.
After a long time she was able to disentangle an idea from the
confusion.
"for herself, but with fear for me. No one can reassure her. In fact it"
was as much for her sake as anyone’s that I sent for you. Reginald has
"tried to trace the thing down himself, but has not succeeded.”"
She paused. The door opened and Reginald Blake entered. He was a young
"fellow, self confident and no doubt very efficient at the new dances,"
"though scarcely fitted to rub elbows with a cold world which, outside"
"of his own immediate circle, knew not the name of Blake. He stood for a"
moment regarding us through the smoke of his cigarette.
"“Tell me just what you have done,” asked Kennedy of him as his mother"
"introduced him, although he had done the talking for her over the"
telephone.
"“Done?” he drawled. “Why, as soon as mother told me of the letter, I"
"left an envelope up at the Prince Henry, as it directed.”"
“With the money?” put in Craig quickly.
"“Oh, no—just as a decoy.”"
“Yes. What happened?”
"“Well, I waited around a long time. It was far along in the day when a"
woman appeared at the desk. I had instructed the clerk to be on the
watch for anyone who asked for mail addressed to a Dr. Hopf. The clerk
slammed the register. That was the signal. I moved up closer.”
“What did she look like?” asked Kennedy keenly.
"“I couldn’t see her face. But she was beautifully dressed, with a long"
"light flowing linen duster, a veil that hid her features and on her"
"By mutual consent, Mrs. Carmichael and Beatrice ceased to talk, but"
"when suddenly there was a movement close to them, and a dim light"
"flashed over the partition, they exchanged a glance of meaning."
"""That is my husband,"" Mrs. Carmichael whispered. ""Something is going"
"to happen. Listen!"""
She was not wrong in her supposition. The Colonel had entered the next
"room, followed by Nicholson and Saunders, and had closed the door"
carefully after him. All three men carried lanterns. They glanced
instinctively at the wooden partition which divided them from the four
"women, but Carmichael shook his head."
"""It's all right,"" he said. ""They must be fast asleep, poor souls."
"Let's have a look at these fellows."" He went over to a huddled-up"
figure lying in the shadow. The corner of a military cloak had been
thrown over the face. He drew it on one side and then let it drop.
"""Gone!"" he said laconically. He passed on to the next. There were in"
"all three men ranged against the wall. Two of them were dead. ""Martins"
"told me they couldn't last,"" Colonel Carmichael muttered. ""It is"
"better for them. They are out of it a little sooner, that's all."" The"
"third man was Travers. He lay on his back, his face turned slightly"
"toward the wall, his eyes closed. He seemed asleep. The Colonel nodded"
"somberly. ""Another ten hours,"" he calculated."
"He came back to the table, where the others waited, and drew out a"
paper from his pocket.
"""Give me your light a moment, Nicholson,"" he said."
No one spoke while he examined the list before him. All around them
"grounds, chatting and sipping tea, I was watching, watching. And my hand"
"was never far from the butt of the Webley automatic which, slung from my"
"waist, was hidden in a bag of silk."""
"""Heavens!"" he cried out. ""You are...."""
"""Hush,"" interposed Madame. ""A lawyer and a Gatepath should be more"
"discreet. The war is over, and I can tell you now that I fought every"
"minute of it in the Secret Service, the Civil branch. I was the head"
"woman, the bright particular star, in Dawson's Secret Corps."""
"""Is it discreet to tell me this?"" he asked, countering her reproof of a"
moment earlier.
"She smiled rather wickedly. ""Are you not a lawyer and a Gatepath? And"
"can one not tell anything to a lawyer and a Gatepath? Besides, I have"
"sent in my resignation, and am now a free woman. It has been a good"
"time, a very good time. I have fought devils and mastered devils in"
"England and France and Italy for four long years, and now I would rest."
You say that time and sorrow have spared me. Yet I have known both time
"and sorrow. Have I not lost...."""
"He broke into a babble of apologies. ""I did not know.... I did not"
"realise...."""
"She waved a hand, and he fell silent. ""I do not wear the trappings of"
"woe, for though I am eternally widowed, I glory in my loss. It was in"
"the rearguard at Caporetto, when all less gallant souls had fled, that"
"my Guilberti fell."""
Of course from that moment Gatepath was her slave. She had flattered him
and humbugged him as she flattered and humbugged all of us. Madame had
“And do you like Rome; eh?”
"“I should say so! At first, I didn’t, I must admit. It was a"
disappointment to me. I had dreamed so much about Rome!” and Kennedy
talked of the books and guides he had read about the Eternal City.
"“I must admit that I had never dreamed about Rome,” said Cæsar. “And"
you boast of that?” asked Laura.
"“No, I don’t boast of it, I merely state it. I understand how agreeable"
it is to know things. Cæsar died here! Cicero made speeches here! Saint
Peter stumbled over this stone! It is fine! But not knowing things
is also very comfortable. I am rather like a barbarian walking
indifferently among monuments he knows nothing about.”
“Doesn’t such an idea make you ashamed?”
"“No, why? It would be a bother to me to know a lot of things offhand. To"
"pass by a mountain and know how it was thrown up, what it is composed"
"of, what its flora and fauna are; to get to a town and know its history"
in detail.... What things to be interested in! It’s tiresome! I hate
"history too much. I far prefer to be ignorant of everything, and"
"especially the past, and from time to time to offer myself a capricious,"
arbitrary explanation.”
"“But I think that knowing things not only is not tiresome,” said"
"Kennedy, “but is a great satisfaction.”"
“You think even learning things is a satisfaction?”
“Thousands of years ago one could know things almost without learning
"them; nowadays in order to know, one has to learn. That is natural and"
"stood a pile of grips, stacked up, packed, and undisturbed."
Winters who had been studying the room while we got our bearings picked
up a queer-looking revolver from the floor. As he held it up I could
see that along the top of the barrel was a long cylinder with a ratchet
or catch at the butt end. He turned it over and over carefully.
"“By George,” he muttered, “it has been fired off.”"
Kennedy glanced more minutely at the body. There was not a mark on it.
I stared about vacantly at the place where Winters had picked the thing
up.
"“Look,” I cried, my eye catching a little hole in the baseboard of the"
woodwork near it.
"“It must have fallen and exploded on the floor,” remarked Kennedy. “Let"
"me see it, Winters.”"
Craig held it at arm’s length and pulled the catch. Instead of an
"explosion, there came a cone of light from the top of the gun. As"
"Kennedy moved it over the wall, I saw in the center of the circle of"
light a dark spot.
"“A new invention,” Craig explained. “All you need to do is to move it"
so that little dark spot falls directly on an object. Pull the
trigger—the bullet strikes the dark spot. Even a nervous and unskilled
marksman becomes a good shot in the dark. He can even shoot from behind
the protection of something—and hit accurately.”
It was too much for me. I could only stand and watch Kennedy as he
deftly bent over Schloss again and placed a piece of chemically
"he had reached the corner house, their house. The carriage gates were"
pushed back; there were fresh marks of wheels on the drive. And then he
"faced the big white-painted house, with its wide-open windows, its"
"tulle curtains floating outwards, its blue jars of hyacinths on the"
broad sills. On either side of the carriage porch their
"hydrangeas—famous in the town—were coming into flower; the pinkish,"
bluish masses of flower lay like light among the spreading leaves. And
"somehow, it seemed to old Mr. Neave that the house and the flowers, and"
"even the fresh marks on the drive, were saying, “There is young life"
here. There are girls—”
"The hall, as always, was dusky with wraps, parasols, gloves, piled on"
"the oak chests. From the music-room sounded the piano, quick, loud and"
impatient. Through the drawing-room door that was ajar voices floated.
"“And were there ices?” came from Charlotte. Then the creak, creak of"
her rocker.
"“Ices!” cried Ethel. “My dear mother, you never saw such ices. Only two"
"kinds. And one a common little strawberry shop ice, in a sopping wet"
frill.”
"“The food altogether was too appalling,” came from Marion."
"“Still, it’s rather early for ices,” said Charlotte easily."
"“But why, if one has them at all....” began Ethel."
"“Oh, quite so, darling,” crooned Charlotte."
"Suddenly the music-room door opened and Lola dashed out. She started,"
"she nearly screamed, at the sight of old Mr. Neave."
She ate alone that evening.
"""Isn't your husband coming in?"" asked the woman of the house."
"""Perhaps he doesn't want anything,"" she replied."
"There he stood, away by the tiny barn pretending to be interested in the"
"roof, in the style of building, and walked round looking at it, pursing"
his lips and whistling. But she could see perfectly well from the window
"that his face was blue and dejected. When she had eaten, she walked down"
"to the shore, calling as she passed him:"
"""Go in and eat!"""
"But he had not sunk quite so low; he would not go in to eat, and slept"
towards the papers in the seed-tray.
“You have great strength of character. You will marry a red-haired man
and have three children. Beware of a blonde woman.” Look out! Look out!
A motor-car driven by a fat chauffeur comes rushing down the hill.
"Inside there a blonde woman, pouting, leaning forward—rushing through"
your life—beware! beware!
"“Ladies and gentlemen, I am an auctioneer by profession, and if what I"
tell you is not the truth I am liable to have my licence taken away
from me and a heavy imprisonment.” He holds the licence across his
chest; the sweat pours down his face into his paper collar; his eyes
look glazed. When he takes off his hat there is a deep pucker of angry
flesh on his forehead. Nobody buys a watch.
Look out again! A huge barouche comes swinging down the hill with two
"“You’ve been under arrest for ten minutes, ‘Silky’ Bob. Chicago thinks"
you may have dropped over our way and wires us she wants to have a chat
"with you. Going quietly, are you? That’s sensible. Now, before we go on"
to the station here’s a note I was asked to hand you. You may read it
here at the window. It’s from Patrolman Wells.”
The man from the West unfolded the little piece of paper handed him.
"His hand was steady when he began to read, but it trembled a little by"
the time he had finished. The note was rather short.
_Bob: I was at the appointed place on time. When you struck the match
to light your cigar I saw it was the face of the man wanted in Chicago.

LOST ON DRESS PARADE
Mr. Towers Chandler was pressing his evening suit in his hall bedroom.
One iron was heating on a small gas stove; the other was being pushed
vigorously back and forth to make the desirable crease that would be
seen later on extending in straight lines from Mr. Chandler’s patent
leather shoes to the edge of his low-cut vest. So much of the hero’s
toilet may be intrusted to our confidence. The remainder may be guessed
by those whom genteel poverty has driven to ignoble expedient. Our next
view of him shall be as he descends the steps of his lodging-house
"""So you're here at last----!"" then with a little gasp drew back, facing"
me in the most entrancing attitude of bewilderment.
It was the girl who had left that ball of paper!
"The sea, always my friend, at this moment did a rather decent thing; it"
gave the yacht a firm but gentle lurch and sent us into each other's
arms. Perhaps nothing else in all the world of chances could so
"effectively have broken the ice between us, for we were laughing as I"
"helped her back to the couch; and, as our eyes met, again we laughed."
"""I didn't know,"" she said, ""that Father brought a guest aboard last"
"night!"""
"""Awkward of him, wasn't it?"" I stammered, sparring for time."
"""One is apt to be awkward in weather like this,"" she graciously"
admitted.
"""You don't know how profoundly aware I am of--of how terribly true that"
"is,"" I stumbled along. ""Is he on deck?"" For, oh, if I could only get to"
see him five minutes alone!
"""No, he's unusually lazy this morning; but I've called, him, the old"
"dear!"""
"A chill crept up my spine--crept up, crept down, and then criss-crossed."
But she must know of her mistake before we had gone so far that putting
me ashore would be a serious inconvenience--for I knew he would put me
"ashore at the nearest point, if not, indeed, set me adrift in an open"
boat. Therefore I suggested:
Her complacency irritated him. The canary never ceased his ear-splitting
"noise. The canary is a beautiful, gentle bird--stuffed; alive, he is"
pestilence made vocal. Risca lost his temper.
"“Surely you must know, Aunt Gladys. I 've been wandering through hell"
with a pack of little devils at my heels.”
"Startled, she lifted up her arms and dropped Dandy, who slithered down"
her dress and sought a morose shelter under the table.
“My dear John!” she exclaimed.
"“I'm very sorry; I did n't mean to use strong language,” said he,"
putting his hands to his ears. “It's all that infernal canary.”
"“Oh, poor Dickie! Don't you like to hear Dickie sing? He sings so"
"beautifully. The gas-man was here the other day and said that, if I"
"liked, he would enter him for a competition, and he was sure he would"
"get first prize. But if you don't like to hear him, dear--though I"
really can't understand why--I can easily make him stop.” She drew a
white napkin from the drawer of the table on which the cage was placed
and threw it over the top. The feathered steam-whistle swallowed his din
"in an angry gurgle or two and became silent “Poor Dickie, he thinks it"
"'s a snowstorm! What were we talking about, John? Do sit down.”"
"John resumed his seat on the slippery couch, and Miss Lindon, having"
"snatched Dandy from his lair, sat by his side, depositing the dog"
between them.
"“You asked me what I had been doing for the last few years,” said he."
"“I’m afraid it wouldn’t do much good in case of an attack,” Ned"
suggested. “We’d soon get hungry and thirsty and have to surrender.”
"“Anyway, it’s an all right thing to shoot from!” Jimmie announced. “If"
"you’d seen the way we sweat rolling those rocks, you’d think it was all"
"right, anyway. I wonder where the boys are.”"
"“I was thinking more about the boys than about the barricade,” Ned"
admitted. “Were they all here when you left?”
"“All sitting in front of the entrance,” Jimmie replied, “except Gilroy,"
and he was asleep on a pile of blankets in the cave.”
"“He may be there yet,” suggested Ned. “Suppose we go and see.”"
"Jimmie made his way through the narrow entrance, found a searchlight,"
and turned a round circle of flame on a great heap of blankets in a back
corner. There was no one in the cave at all save only himself.
"Before returning to report to Ned, the hungry boy seized a plate of corn"
pones and a can of tinned beans from the provision chest.
"“Look here, Ned,” he said in a moment, appearing before his chum with"
"his mouth full of beans, “the appetite of our midnight visitor seems to"
be for confidential clerks as well as for bread. Someone has stolen
"Gilroy! Anyway, he’s not in the cave!”"
"“He may have gone away with the boys,” suggested Ned."
"“He wasn’t thinking of going away with the boys when I left,” Jimmie"
"answered. “He was telling how much he liked New York, and how he’d like"
"this way, Mr. Gilroy,” he went on, “the bears out here are hungry for"
"fat clerks from Wall street. I’ve heard they make stews of ’em,” he"
concluded.
Gilroy now arose to his feet and stood gazing into the thicket in the
direction of the bear’s disappearance. Jimmie’s assertion that bruin
would hit the Arctic circle early the next morning seemed to give him
"great comfort. As the distance between the bear and himself increased,"
he grew braver and began throwing out his chest.
"“What a chance that was for me to kill a bear!” he began, boastfully,"
"“If I’d only had a gun with me, I might have had a fine rug made out of"
his hide! It would have been fine to show my friends.”
“Sure it would!” declared Jimmie. “I’m glad you didn’t remember that you
had a gun in your pocket. The bears out here are pretty sensitive about
"being shot at. If you’d blazed away at that cub, and hadn’t shot him"
"dead in his tracks the first time, he would have eaten you.”"
Gilroy put his hand to his pistol pocket and a look of pretended
amazement came over his fat face.
"“Upon my word!” he said, “I thought I left my gun in the bunk!”"
"“After this,” Ned advised, “always keep your gun in sight when you go"
"into the forest. Suppose there had been no tree to climb, what then?”"
"“I should have grappled with him, sir!” exclaimed Gilroy. “I certainly"
should have grappled with him.”
"“You would have had to catch him first,” Jimmie grinned."
"She threw up her hand suddenly, as if she were about to vent on him"
"all the passions which consumed her--the terror, rage, and shame which"
"swelled in her breast. But something in his gibing tone, something in"
the set lines of his figure--she could not see his face--checked her.
"She let her hand fall in a gesture of despair, and shrank into"
"herself, shuddering. She looked at him as at a serpent--that"
fascinated her. At last she murmured--
'You will not dare. What have they done to you?'
"'Nothing,' he answered. 'It is not their affair; it is yours.'"
For a moment after that they stood confronting one another while the
"sound of the women sobbing in a corner, and the occasional jingle of a"
"bridle outside, alone broke the silence. Behind her the room was dark;"
"behind him, through the open windows, lay the road, glimmering pale"
"through the dusk. Suddenly the door at her back opened, and a bright"
light flashed on his face. It was Marie Wort bringing in a lamp. No
"one spoke, and she set the lamp on the table, and going by him began"
"to close the shutters. Still the Countess stood as if turned to stone,"
and he stood watching her.
"'Where are they?' she moaned at last, though he had already told her."
"'In the camp,' he said."
'Can I--can I see them?' she panted.
"'Afterwards,' he answered, with the smile of a fiend; 'when you are my"
wife.'
cold fury:
"""You better stop that laughin', Jack Rance, or I'll send you to finish"
"it in some place where things ain't so funny."""
Something in the Girl's altered tone so struck the Sheriff that he
"obeyed her. He said nothing, but on his lips were the words, ""By Heaven,"
"the Girl means it!"" and his eyes showed a smouldering admiration."
"""He doesn't hear you,--he's out of it. But me--me--I hear you--I ain't"
"out of it,"" the Girl went on in compelling tones. ""You're a gambler; he"
"was, too; well, so am I."" She crossed deliberately to the bureau, and"
"laid her pistol away in the drawer, Rance meanwhile eyeing her with"
"puzzled interest. Returning, she went on, incisively as a whip lash:"
"""I live on chance money, drink money, card money, saloon money. We're"
"gamblers,--we're all gamblers!"" She paused, an odd expression coming"
"over her face,--an expression that baffled Rance's power to read."
"Presently she resumed: ""Now, you asked me to-night if my answer was"
"final,--well, here's your chance. I'll play you the game,--straight"
"poker. It's two out o' three for me. Hatin' the sight o' you, it's the"
"nearest chance you'll ever get for me."""
"""Do you mean--"" began Rance, his hands resting on the table, his"
hawk-like glance burning into her very thoughts.
"""Yes, with a wife in Noo Orleans all right,"" she interrupted him"
"feverishly. ""If you're lucky,--you'll git 'im an' me. But if you"
"lose,--this man settin' between us is mine--mine to do with as I please,"
"an' you shut up an' lose like a gentleman."""
"""You must be crazy about him!"" The words seemed wrung from the Sheriff"
against his will.
hands. Everything living had been slain. Astura was a castle of the
dead.
"""God! What work!"" exclaimed the Pisan. It was the testimony wrung from"
him by the stress of sheer hard fighting.
"""One of the viper-brood still lives,"" the duke turned to his"
"companion, kicking with the tip of his steel boot the lifeless form of"
Giovanni Frangipani.
The Pisan turned to a man-at-arms.
"""Take twenty men! Scour the lair from vault to pinnacle! We must have"
"that other,--dead or alive!"""
The rain had ceased for the time. New thunder-clouds came rolling out
of the west. Flambeaux flared in the court. Black shadows danced along
the ghostly walls. The wind moaned about the crenelated turrets;
"sentinels of the Pisans stood everywhere, alert for ambush."
The duke and his companions approached the door leading into the great
hall. It lay in splinters. Stygian darkness held sway within.
"Suddenly the duke paused, as if turned to stone, at the same time"
plucking his companion back by the sleeve of his surcoat.
Noiselessly as a ghost out of the door came the form of a woman. She
"was tall, exquisitely proportioned, and young. For a moment she paused"
on the threshold and looked out into the night. Almost immediately a
"second form followed, and paused near the first: that of a man. The"
"woman seemed to stare blindly at the duke, with wide, unseeing eyes,"
as one who walks in a sleep.
"presence, especially as I read he's indisposed, but really I hardly know"
how to bear the situation.  I can't bring myself to think of money in
"relation to that matter; all the same, it's a serious loss to my"
"daughter, very serious loss.  I've got my family pride to think of.  My"
"daughter's name, well--it's my own; and, though I say it, I'm"
"respected--a regular attendant--I think I told you. Sometimes, I assure"
"you, I feel I can't control myself, and it's only that--and you, if I may"
"say so, that keeps me in check."""
"During this speech, his black-gloved hands were clenching and"
"unclenching, and he shifted his broad, shining boots.  Gyp gazed at them,"
not daring to look up at his eyes thus turning and turning from
"Christianity to shekels, from his honour to the world, from his anger to"
herself.  And she said:
"""Please let me do what I ask, Mr. Wagge.  I should be so unhappy if I"
"mightn't do that little something."""
Mr. Wagge blew his nose.
"""It's a delicate matter,"" he said.  ""I don't know where my duty lays.  I"
"don't, reelly."""
Gyp looked up then.
"""The great thing is to save Daisy suffering, isn't it?"""
"Mr. Wagge's face wore for a moment an expression of affront, as if from"
the thought: 'Sufferin'!  You must leave that to her father!' Then it
"wavered; the curious, furtive warmth of the attracted male came for a"
"moment into his little eyes; he averted them, and coughed.  Gyp said"
softly:
to pound his ear for about three days and nights.”
"“Anyway,” Ned decided, “we’ll wait here a little while and see if they"
"don’t return. In the meantime, you can get yourself something to eat.”"
“Don’t you call this something to eat?” asked Jimmie.
“One poor little can of beans and one poor little plate of corn pones
"won’t make much of an impression on your appetite,” Ned laughed. “What"
"you need is one of those neat little bear steaks, about as large as a"
warming pan. You’ll have plenty of time in which to cook it.”
"“And that means that I can cook one for you, too?” asked Jimmie."
"“Why, of course you can!” returned Ned."
“I’d like to cook one for the Boy Scout who got us both into such
"trouble,” Jimmie declared. “I’d put poison on it!”"
"“Now, don’t you be too severe on that Boy Scout,” Ned advised."
"“According to your own story, he warned you and Frank in the thicket,"
"and I know very well that he wanted to tell me something, but didn’t"
dare do it.”
"“Well, here’s another thing,” Jimmie explained. “When I went out to look"
"for you, I gave the ‘help’ smoke signal from the top of a granite rock"
in the pines. In five minutes after the columns of smoke became large
"enough to be seen at a distance, the signal was answered from the north,"
"it seemed to me from the vicinity of the old mission. Now, of course,"
you didn’t send out that signal.”
"“I rather think not,” smiled Ned."
He shook his head.
"""Well, there was a certain shrewd old cannery-man in Washington State"
"whose catch consisted almost wholly of pink fish. As you know, that"
"variety does not bring as high a price as red salmon, like these. Well,"
"finding that he could not sell his catch, owing to the popular"
"prejudice about color, this man printed a lot of striking can-labels,"
"which read, 'Best Grade Pink Salmon, Warranted not to Turn Red in the"
"Can.' They tell me it worked like a charm."""
"""No wonder!"" Boyd laughed, beginning to feel the tension of his nerves"
"relax at the restfulness of her influence. As usual, he fell at once"
into the mood she desired for him. He saw that her brows were furrowed
"and her rosy lips drawn into an unconscious pout as she said, more to"
herself than to him:
"""I wish I were a man. I'd like to engage in a business of this sort,"
something that would require ingenuity and daring. I'd like to handle
"big affairs."""
"""It seems to me that you are in a business of that sort. You are one of"
"us."""
"""Oh, but you and George are doing it all."""
"""There is your copper-mine. You surely handled that very cleverly."""
"Cherry's expression altered, and she shot a quick glance at him as he"
went on:
"""How is it coming along, by-the-way? I haven't heard you mention it"
"“Thanks,” said Mrs. Winstanley, and then, suddenly looking at Yvonne--"
"“Mercy, my dear! How white you are!”"
"“There’s nothing the matter with me,” said Yvonne, trying to smile."
"“It’s past our _déjeuner_ hour,” said the Canon, briskly. “You want some"
food.”
"“Perhaps I do,” said Yvonne."
"She went with the Canon on to the _digue_, and walked along the shady"
"side, by the hotels, past the gay terraces thronged with lunching"
guests. But all the glamour had gone from the place. An hour had changed
it. And that hour seemed a black abyss separating her from happiness.
"An hour ago she had looked upon this kind, grave man who walked by"
her side as her husband. Now what was he to her? She shrank from the
"thought, terrified, and came nearer to him, touching the flying skirt of"
his coat as if to take strength from him.
"They entered the crowded dining-room, where the _maître d’hôtel_ had"
"reserved them a table. She struggled bravely through part of the meal,"
strove to keep up a conversation. But the strain was too great. Another
"five minutes, she felt, would make her hysterical. She rose, with an"
"excuse to the Canon, and escaped to her room."
There she flung herself down on the bed and buried her face in the cool
pillows. It was a relief to be alone with her fright and dismay. She
"strove to think, but her head was in a whirl. The incidents of the late"
"scene came luridly before her mind, and she shivered with revulsion. A"
rough hand had been laid on the butterfly and brushed the dust from its
"twenty...."""
My own thoughts run away with me as I stand there wishing I were somewhere
"else. Perhaps she, too, in her room wishes me far away."
"""Good-bye,"" I say to the actor. ""Will you remember me to Miss Torsen? I"
"must go now."""
"""Good-bye,"" says he, shaking hands in some surprise. ""Can't you wait a few"
"minutes? Well, all right, I'll give her your greeting. Good-bye,"
"good-bye."""
"I take a short cut to get out of the way, and as I know every nook and"
"corner, I am soon outside the farm, and find a good shelter. From here I"
shall see when these two leave. She has only to say good-bye now to the
people of the farm.
It struck me that yesterday was the last time I spoke to her. We spoke
"only a few insignificant words that I have forgotten, and today I have not"
spoken to her....
Here they come.
Curious--they seemed somehow to have become welded together; though they
"walked separately up the mountain track, yet they belonged together. They"
did not speak; the essential things had probably already been said. Life
had grown ordinary for them; it still remained to them to be of use to
"each other. He walked first, while she followed many paces behind; it was"
lonely to look at against the rugged background of the mountain. Where had
her tall figure gone to? She seemed to have grown shorter because she had
hitched up her skirt and was carrying her knapsack on her back. They each
"carried one, but he carried hers and she his, probably because, owing to"
mix the hats.... Ha-ha!” He laughed mock-tragically. “This night must
never be forgotten!”
"“It never will,” said Blotte; and laughing grimly he got striding again"
"in the red wig, as Fluffy Reubens and Doome burst into the room."
"“Here, Fluffy,” said Rippley, “quick, man! put on this yellow wig, and"
"comb it well over your eyes. There isn’t a moment to be lost; Doome,"
here’s a black moustache and a greyish wig--this is the way to stick it
on--see? Splendid! Makes you look like a broken-down Italian tenor.”
He searched about in the cabinet and found a stubbly black wig which he
"pulled over his own hair, and was at once a son of France:"
"“Look here, boys, I’m head-waiter, see! And when I bow, you bow: and"
"when I rub my hands, you rub your hands; and don’t forget the foreign"
"accent--try to talk English as you used to talk French.... Doome, you"
"stand at the landing below, and see that old Dukes don’t stir a step"
"from the door--and bawl up the names from him. And you, Fluffy, play"
the general ass. I’ll stick to the door here.... Are we all right
"now?... No, Blotte’s not enough disguised. Here, Doome, fasten this"
"fierce moustache on his lip, whilst I shut up.... O lor! here they"
come!”
Rippley had scarcely hurried into his coat when there entered and
halted in the great doorway a hesitating figure in the white satin
"dress of a courtier of Charles the First, lace frills at his weak"
"knees, white stockings, white shoes, and holding a plumed hat in his"
hand.
"His eyeglass dropped out of his eye, and he stood there stuttering and"
aghast.
"his grotesque body, spoke for him."
"""That,"" he was certainly saying, ""is what will happen to any on your"
"helpless planet who dare oppose the Rogan will!"""
He whipped out a command to the terror-stricken girl. She rose from
her crouching position on the floor; and at length formulated the
Rogan's last order:
"""You will explain the working of the engine that drove your space ship"
"here."""
"Dex laughed. It was a short bark of sound, totally devoid of humor,"
but very full of defiance. Brand thrust his hands into the pockets of
"his tunic, spread his legs apart, and began to whistle."
*       *       *       *       *
A quiver that might have been of anger touched the Rogan leader's
repulsive little mouth. He glared balefully at the uncowed Earthmen
"and spoke again, evidently repeating his command. The two turned their"
backs to him to indicate their refusal to obey.
"At that, the tall leader pointed to Dex. In an instant three of the"
guards had wound their double pairs of arms around his struggling
"body. Brand sprang to help him, but a touch of the mysterious"
discharge from the leader's tube sent him writhing to the floor.
"""It's no use, Brand,"" said Dex steadily. He too had stopped"
"struggling, and now stood quietly in the slimy coils of his captors'"
"arms. ""I might as well go along with them and get it over with. I"
"probably won't see you again. Good luck!"""
pillow.
I held my breath.  The awful truth was distinctly apparent.  I placed my
"hand upon her heart, the bodice of her dress being already unloosened."
"Then a few seconds later I drew back, standing rigid and aghast."
"""Why, she's dead!""  I gasped."
"""Yes,"" the Countess said, covering her face with her hands and bursting"
"into tears.  ""My poor Yolande! she is dead--_dead_!"""
The discovery appalled me.  Only a couple of hours before we had chatted
"together, and she seemed in the best of health and spirits, just as in"
"the old days, until I had made the announcement of Wolf's presence in"
Paris.  The effect of that statement upon her had apparently been
"electrical.  Why, I knew not.  Had she not implored me to save her?"
This in itself was sufficient to show that she held him in deadly fear.
"Again I bent in order to make further examination, but saw the"
unmistakable mark of death upon her countenance.  The lower jaw had
"dropped, the checks were cold, and the silver hand-mirror which I had"
snatched from the table and held at her mouth was unclouded.  There was
"no movement--no life.  Yolande, my well-beloved of those long-past days,"
was dead.
I stood there at the bedside like a man in a dream.  So swiftly had she
been struck down that the terrible truth seemed impossible of
realisation.
"The Countess, standing beside me, sobbed bitterly.  Truly the scene in"
that darkened chamber was a strange and impressive one.  Never before in
my whole life had I been in the presence of the dead.
Dawson spoke with less than his usual cheery confidence. I fancy that
the thinness and whiteness of his face were not wholly due to
disguise. He had not been to bed since he had been called up in the
"middle watch of the night before last, and the man was worn out."
"""If you take my poor advice, Dawson,"" I said, ""you will cut off now"
and get some sleep. Even your brain cannot work continuously without
"rest. The country needs you at your best, and needs you very badly"
"indeed."""
"His dull, weary eyes lighted as if under the stimulus of champagne,"
and he turned upon me a look which was almost affectionate. I really
"began to believe that Dawson likes me, that he sees in me a kindred"
spirit as patriotically unscrupulous as himself.
"He jumped up and gripped my hand. ""You are right. I will put in a few"
hours' sleep and then to work once more. This time I am up against a
"man who is nearly as smart as I am myself, and I can't afford to carry"
"any handicap."""
"I led him to the door and put him out, and then turned to Cary with a"
"laugh. ""And I, too, will follow Dawson's example. It is past one, and"
"my head is buzzing with queer ideas. Perhaps, after all, the Germans"
"have more imagination than we usually credit them with. I wonder--"""
But I did not tell to Cary what I wondered.
*       *       *       *       *
"We were sitting after breakfast in Cary's study, enjoying the first"
"sweet pipe of the day, when the telephone bell rang. Cary took off the"
earpiece and I listened to a one-sided conversation somewhat as
follows:--
rather know that George had gone to Canada than to fear his return to
England under the circumstances.
"""The dastardly king will take his life if he comes,"" she said."
"""I admit the danger,"" I answered, as hopefully as possible, ""but I"
"believe, if George comes, he will be able to take care of himself."""
"""Danger!"" she exclaimed. ""It is certain death! George will find no"
"mercy."""
"""If he is caught,"" I answered. ""But the letter from King Louis will"
convince King Charles that Hamilton is in Canada and will throw our
jealous monarch off his guard. Perhaps Hamilton will be safer than we
"suppose. He speaks French like a Parisian, but, above all, he is cool,"
"calm, and thoughtful in danger. The London merchants will be far more"
"dangerous than the king."""
"""It does seem that we are guilty of treason to our country in thus"
"helping France,"" she said. Then laughingly, ""But I'll go back to the"
"palace at once and begin my task of wheedling the king."" She paused for a"
"moment, then continued hesitatingly, ""Do you suppose it possible that"
"George would doubt me afterwards?"""
"""Impossible,"" I answered, with emphasis that seemed to reassure her."
"""I am doing it for him,"" she continued with a sigh. ""God knows I would"
"do almost anything in the same cause. But I do not know men, and I fear"
it is possible that he will doubt me after I have succeeded. Let us go
"to see Betty. She is restful to me, and always soothes my nerves. But"
"besides, I want to have her help. I'll introduce her to the king--"""
"'Guffin.'  And hevery skipper was the 'Guffin,' new and old, go or"
"stay.  But when we broke hoff to hargue, why, we was talkin' about"
them French jossers and whether Sallis-bury was a-goin' to let 'em
"chip into our game and straddle the Nile."""
"""That's so,"" said the crowd, and the House was rough."
"Meanwhile, the skipper, or ""old man"" (who henceforward, by the way,"
"was called the ""Guffin""), and his two mates were discussing the"
"latest aspect of world politics, as they drank whiskey and water."
"""What's wrong with Salisbury,"" said the Guffin, who was as stout as a"
"barrel and as sturdy, ""is, that he ain't got a backbone.  He just"
lets 'em blow him about like so much paper.  What he wants is
"stiffenin': he's like a sprung spar.  That's what he's like."""
"The mate, a tough-looking dog with hair like anæmic tussac grass in"
"patches on his face, shook his head."
"""I've a greater opinion of him, captain, than you have.  All his"
double shuffle is cunning.  It's getting back so's to lead them
"French on.  Mark me, he'll play them yet a fair knock-out."""
The Guffin sneered.
"""He may have cunnin', Lampert, but he ain't no real tact.  Now,"
"diplomatic tact, I take it, is not givin' way into the gutter, but"
just showin' as you're a nice pleasant-spoken chap as don't mean to
be put on.  It's my good opinion as these foreigners don't yearn to
"fight us.  And men like you and me, Lampert, gets to learn the way of"
handlin' foreigners.  Who has so much experience with 'em as them in
"command of English ships?"""
"back and clicked his teeth at the ceiling. ""Think we'd have nested out"
"nicely."""
"I hitched myself up to him and we sat on the bunk, glooming away at"
each other. Then we heard the tramp of feet in the crossway.
Butt swung down and headed for the control compartment in the
nose of the lifeboat. He had his blaster out and was cursing very
"interestingly. I started after him, but he picked me up by the seat"
of my jumper and tossed me toward the door. The Captain came in and
tripped over me.
I got all tangled up in his gold braid and million-mile space buttons.
"When we finally got to our feet and sorted out right, he was breathing"
"very hard. The Captain was a round little man with a plump, golden face"
"and a very scared look on it. He _humphed_ at me, just the way Sis"
"does, and lifted me by the scruff of my neck. The Chief Mate picked me"
up and passed me to the Second Assistant Engineer.
"Sis was there, being held by the purser on one side and the Chief"
"Computer's Mate on the other. Behind them, I could see a flock of"
wide-eyed female passengers.
"""You cowards!"" Sis was raging. ""Letting your Captain face a dangerous"
"outlaw all by himself!"""
"""I dunno, Miss Sparling,"" the Computer's Mate said, scratching the"
"miniature slide-rule insignia on his visor with his free hand. ""The Old"
"Man would've been willing to let it go with a log entry, figuring the"
spaceport paddlefeet could pry out the stowaway when we landed. But you
"had to quote the Mother Anita Law at him, and he's in there doing his"
"duty. He figures the rest of us are family men, too, and there's no"
Pola ate with nervous greed. Sidney bit off a piece but found it dry in
her mouth. She was thinking of her sisters and the safety of the dear
old house; as vividly as though it hung in a picture before her eyes
"she saw the little circle around the dining room table, the embroidered"
"square of Indian cloth, the green shaded lamp, Issy's books and Trude's"
"sewing, Vick's sketching things, the girls at their beloved tasks--and"
"her chair empty! Oh, what if she never sat again in that dear circle?"
Her heart broke in an agony of longing for Trude.
A sudden thought roused Pola to a feeble show of spirit.
"""If I had known how to swim we'd all be ashore now! And you two stayed"
"with me! I--I don't believe I'm worth that, girls."" She spoke with"
gloomy conviction.
But Mart answered with a promptness that settled that question forever.
"""Forget it. Why, you don't think we could a' done anything else, do"
you? And now I'm going up on deck and get some air. We must be most to
"Halifax by this time."""
"""_Halifax!_"" But this time Pola did not scream."
*       *       *       *       *
"Lavender, after his first plunge, had struck out toward the lighthouse."
His Mr. Dugald had taught him the science of swimming and because it
"was the one thing he could do easily and well, in spite of his"
"misshaped body, Lavender had taken pride in perfecting the practice."
"His assurance helped him now; he had no fear, he knew how to save his"
"strength; he swam first with one stroke, then with another, always"
keeping in sight the beacon of light.
till the day I can hand you your hundred thousand in cash. Everything's
"fair, square, and above-board now. I'm not asking you to risk anything."
"""And where in the wide world can you expect to do better for yourself!"""
"he argued. ""If you go East you'll get no more for the girl--and look at"
"the expense! You'll be sorry all the rest of your life, too, for I know"
you'd far sooner see her decently settled than sell her to any dog-faced
son-of-a-gun of a mandarin!
"""You can say what you like,"" he concluded, although Captain Dove had"
"said never a word. ""Clean money's pleasanter to spend than dirty, any"
"day. If I had been born wealthy, I'd never have needed to touch a marked"
"card. And now's your chance, too, to pull out of a rotten rut that'll"
"sooner or later land you among the chain-gang."""
"Captain Dove came forth from his cabin, indifferently clad, and eyed"
Slyne with a sarcastic interest which somewhat disconcerted that
homilist.
"""You don't _look_ just like a Band o' Hope!"" said the old man, ""but--"""
"Slyne rose again, and bit his lip, in simulated impatience. ""Oh, all"
"right,"" said he. ""If you're not interested--"""
"Captain Dove scowled at him. ""I'm interested,"" he said grudgingly. ""I'll"
"see this lawyer-fellow of yours whenever you like to bring him aboard,"
"and--if the money's there, you can count me in."""
"""He isn't the sort of lawyer you've been accustomed to, Dove,"" said"
"Slyne. ""You've got to go to him."""
"Captain Dove did his best to out-stare him, but failed."
And he went out and banged the door behind him. He walked the streets
furiously angry with Herold. He had gone to consult him on a baffling
problem. Herold had suggested a maiden aunt as a solution. He had but
"one, his mother's sister. Her name was Gladys. What was a woman of over"
fifty doing with such an idiot name? His Aunt Gladys lived at Croydon
and spent her time solving puzzles and following the newspaper accounts
of the doings of the royal family. She knew nothing. He remembered when
he was a boy at school coming home for the holidays cock-a-whoop at
having won the high jump in the school athletics sports. His Aunt
"Gladys, while professing great interest, had said, “But what I don't"
"understand, dear, is--what do you get on to jump down from?” He had"
"smiled and explained, but he had felt cold in the pit of his stomach. A"
futile lady. His opinion of her had not changed. In these days John was
rather an intolerant fellow.
"Chance willed it, however, that when he reached Fenton Square he found"
a letter which began “My dearest John” and ended “Your loving Aunt
Gladys.” And it was the letter of a very sweet-natured gentlewoman.
"John sat down at his desk to work, but ideas would not come. At last"
"he lit his pipe, threw himself into a chair in front of the fire, and"
"smoked till past midnight, with his heavy brows knitted in a tremendous"
frown.
CHAPTER VI
THE same frown darkened Risca's brow the next day as he waited for
admittance at his Aunt Gladys's door. It was such a futile little door
"on his feet once more, pulling his clothes to rights, we looked at each"
"other. I had no wish to speak to him further, and left him. Besides, he"
was going away soon.
"After this, everything was dull and empty again. I went out alone, aping"
"myself and shouting: ""Bricks for the palace! The calf is much stronger"
"today!"" And when this was done, I did other nothings, and when my money"
"began to run out, I wrote to my publisher, pretending I would soon send"
"him an unbelievably remarkable manuscript. In short, I behaved like a man"

And to take the bull by the horns: no doubt you suspect me of dwelling on
the subject of Miss Torsen out of self-interest? In that case I must have
concealed well in these pages that I never think of her except as an
"object, as a theme; turn back the pages and you will see! At my age, one"
"does not fall in love without becoming grotesque, without making even the"
Pharaohs laugh.

"But there is one thing I cannot finish doing, and that is withdrawing to"
"my room, and sitting alone with the good darkness round me. This, after"
"all, is the last pleasure."
An interlude:
Miss Torsen and her actor are walking this way; I hear their footsteps and
"their voices; but since I am sitting in the dark of the evening, I cannot"
"see them. They stop outside my open window, leaning against it, and the"
"actor says something, asks her to do something she does not want to do,"
"""Welcome to the wonderful world of Tanzan Mino. I don't know where the"
"hell we are, but it's definitely not Kansas, or London."""
"""My head feels like I was at ground zero when the bomb hit. My whole"
"body aches."" She groaned and plopped back down on the futon. ""What time"
"do you think it is?"""
"""Haven't a clue. How about starting with what day?"" He felt for his"
"watch and realized it was gone. ""What does it matter anyway? Nobody has"
"clocks in never-never land."""
"Satisfied she was okay, he stood up and surveyed the room. Then he saw"
"what he'd expected. There in the center of the ceiling, integrated into"
"the pattern of light-colored woods, was the glass eye of a video"
camera.
And the music. Still the faint music.
He walked on down to the far end of her room and shoved aside another
"set of sliding doors, also painted with the double-ax insignia. He"
"found himself looking at a third large space, this one paneled in raw"
"cypress. It was vast, and in the center was a cedar hot tub, sunk into"
"the floor. The water was fresh and steaming, and two tiny stools and"
rinsing pails were located conveniently nearby on the redwood decking.
"It was a traditional _o-furo_, one of the finest he'd ever seen."
"""You're not going to believe this."" He turned back and waved her"
forward. In the soft rice-paper glow of the lamp she looked rakishly
disheveled. Japanese architecture always made him think of lovemaking.
"""Our host probably figured we'd want to freshen up for the festivities."
"Check it out."""
(_b_) The wife of a knight or baronet is _Lady_. Whether this title
precedes or follows her forename depends upon whether she had a title
before her marriage.
"That is, if Lady Mary Smith marries Sir John Brown (either knight or"
"baronet), she is _Lady Mary Brown_, also if Hon. Mary Smith marries"
Sir John Brown (knight or baronet) she is _Lady Mary Brown_; but if
"Miss Mary Smith marries Sir John Brown (knight or baronet), she becomes"
"_Mary, Lady Brown_."
"(_c_) A maid of honor retains her _Hon._ after marriage, unless, of"
"course, it is merged into a higher title."
"Thus, if she marries a baronet she is the _Honᵇˡᵉ Lady Brown_; if a"
"peer, the _Lady So and So_. In either case as though she had been a"
peer's daughter.
(_d_) The wife of an earl's (or higher peer's) younger son is never the
_Honᵇˡᵉ Lady_; if she used the _Lady_ before marriage in her own right
"she does not, of course, add anything by such marriage, but the wife"
of a younger son of a lower peer than an earl is _Honᵇˡᵉ Mrs._ (not
"_Lady_)--the younger children of all peers using, of course, the family"
"name, with or without their forenames, according to their rank."
(_e_) If the lady to whom the title _Hon._ belongs in virtue of her
"father's rank marries a commoner, she retains her title, becoming"
"_Hon. Lady_ if she marries a knight or baronet, and _Hon. Mrs._ if her"
husband has no title.
None of these courtesy titles is inherited by the children of those who
"bear them, the third generation of even the highest peer being simply"
"""You do!"""
"""I admit that every circumstance points to--"""
"""Stop! Don't you give me any more o' that Webster Unabridged. You git to"
"cases. If you didn't come here to steal you came to The Polka to rob it,"
"didn't you?"""
"Johnson, his eyes lowered, was forced to admit that such were his"
"intentions, adding swiftly:"
"""But when I knew about you--"" He broke off and took a step towards her."
"""Wait! Wait! Wait where you are! Don't you take a step further or"
"I'll--"" She made a significant gesture towards her bosom, and then,"
"laughing harshly, went on denouncingly: ""A road agent! A road agent!"
"Well, ain't it my luck! Wouldn't anybody know to look at me that a"
"gentleman wouldn't fall my way! A road agent! A road agent!"" And again"
"she laughed bitterly before going on: ""But now you can git--git, you"
"thief, you imposer on a decent woman! I ought to have tol' 'em all, but"
I wa'n't goin' to be the joke o' the world with you behind the curtains
an' me eatin' charlotte rusks an' lemming turnovers an' a-polkyin' with
"a road agent! But now you can git--git, do you hear me?"""
Johnson heard her to the end with bowed head; and so scathing had been
her denunciations of his actions that the fact that pride alone kept her
from breaking down completely escaped his notice. With his eyes still
downcast be said in painful fragments:
"""One word only--only a word and I'm not going to say anything in defence"
of myself. For it's all true--everything is true except that I would
"""Well, show me the girl that would want to go to Heaven alone! I'll sell"
"out the saloon--I'll go anywhere with you, you bet!"""
Johnson bent low over her hand and kissed it. The Girl's straightforward
answer had filled his heart to overflowing with joy.
"""You know what that means, don't you?"" a moment later he asked."
Sudden joy leapt to her blue eyes.
"""Oh, yes,"" she told him with a world of understanding in her voice."
"There was a silence; then she went on reminiscently: ""There's a little"

the light burnin' before the Virgin an' see the saints standin' round
with glassy eyes an' faded satin slippers. An' I often tho't what they'd
"think if I was to walk right in to be made--well, some man's wife. It"
makes your blood like pin-points thinkin' about it. There's somethin'
"kind o' holy about love, ain't they?"""
"Johnson nodded. He had never regarded love in that light before, much"
"less known it. For many moments he stood motionless, a new problem of"
right and wrong throbbing in his bosom.
"At last, it being settled that Johnson was to pass the night in the"
"Girl's cabin, she went over to the bed and, once more, began to make it"
"ready for his occupancy. Meanwhile, Johnson, seated in the barrel rocker"
"before the fire, watched her with a new interest. The Girl had not gone"
"very far with her duties, however, when she suddenly came over to him,"
plumping herself down on the floor at his feet.
"""Say, did you ever ask any other woman to marry you?"" she asked as she"
"Petunikoff and his kind tremble and perspire before me!"""
"""Ah!  You have a courageous tongue!"" jeered Abyedok."
"""Yes ...  You miser!""  And Kuvalda looked at him contemptuously.  ""What"
do you understand?  What do you know?  Are you able to think?  But I
have thought and I have read ... books of which you could not have
"understood one word."""
"""Of course!  One cannot eat soup out of one's hand ... But though you"
"have read and thought, and I have not done that or anything else, we"
"both seem to have got into pretty much the same condition, don't we?"""
"""Go to the Devil!"" shouted Kuvalda.  His conversations with Abyedok"
"always ended thus.  When the teacher was absent his speeches, as a"
"rule, fell on the empty air, and received no attention, and he knew"
"this, but still he could not help speaking.  And now, having quarrelled"
"with his companion, he felt rather deserted; but, still longing for"
"conversation, he turned to Simtsoff with the following question: ""And"
"you, Aleksei Maksimovitch, where will you lay your grey head?"""
"The old man smiled good-humouredly, rubbed his hands, and replied, ""I"
"do not know ...  I will see.  One does not require much, just a little"
"drink."""
"""Plain but honourable fare!"" the Captain said.  Simtsoff was silent,"
"only adding that he would find a place sooner than any of them, because"
"women loved him.  This was true.  The old man had, as a rule, two or"
"three prostitutes, who kept him on their very scant earnings.  They"
"very often beat him, but he took this stoically.  They somehow never"
"beat him too much, probably because they pitied him.  He was a great"
"lover of women, and said they were the cause of all his misfortunes."
"""That's so,"" said the second mate, who had been listening.  ""Now last"
"v'y'ge in the _Battleaxe_, there was a Dago in my watch as come from"
the betwixt and between land where Spain jines France.  And he was
"the Dagoest Dago I ever sailed with.  But I knew the breed, and the"
first time he opens his garlicky mouth I hauled off and hit him.  And
then I took his knife away and snapped the point off.  And I says to
"him, 'Now, you black beggar, every time at muster you'll show me that"
"knife, and there'll be peace in the land.'  And he done so, and there"
"was peace."""
"The captain (or ""Guffin"") smote his thigh."
"""You're right, Simcox, you're right, and if Salisbury was to take a"
"leaf out of your log-book in respects of handlin' Dagoes, 'twould be"
"better for all concerned.  But no, not him.  He goes on seein' them"
French make a fleet and he lets 'em!  He actually sees 'em with their
"fleet sharpenin' on the grindstone and never says from the poop,"
"'Chuck that overboard, you swine, or I'll come and 'andle you so's"
"you'll be glad to die.'"""
"The second mate was much gratified, as was obvious by his standing"
first on one foot and then on another.  But Lampert was not so
pleased.
"""Why, you talk--you, captain and you, Simcox--as if they had a fleet."
"Why, it's my opinion--and experts say 'ditto' to me there--that a"
"string o' band-boxes with crackers in 'em, and all on a mud-flat,"
would do as much harm as the French fleet--unless they blows up when
"we takes 'em."""

"""True, true, what a hole it is,"" returned the count, regretfully. ""The"

He saw by the expression of my face that while I might abuse my own

tact he held up his hand to keep me from speaking till he could correct
himself.
"""Pardon, baron, I forgot the 'r,' The Englishman's affectation of a"

"Not a pig--a prig! Is it not so?"""
"""True, true, count,"" I returned, unable to restrain a laugh. ""It is the"

Such was Mrs. Winstanley’s passing thought one day. She was there with
"Sophia and Evan Wilmington. It was always a great pleasure, she used"
"to say, to have young people about her; and very naturally, since young"
people can be particularly useful in strange places to a middle-aged
"lady. The brother and sister fetched and carried for her all day long,"
"which was very nice and suitable, and Mrs. Winstanley was in her"
"most affable mood. On the day in question, however, she saw, to her"
"astonishment and annoyance, Canon Chisely and Yvonne making their way"
towards her through the crowded lines of tables.
"“Good gracious, Everard!” she said as they came up. “How did you find"
your way here? I thought you were going to Switzerland.”
"“So we are,” replied the Canon. “We have broken our journey. And as for"
"getting here, we took the boat from Dover and then walked.”"
"“The frivolity of the place is infecting you already, Canon,” cried"
"Sophia, with a laugh. “I hope you are going to stay a long time.”"
"“Oh, not too long,” said Yvonne. “It wouldn’t be fair to the Canon, who"
needs some mountain air. This is just a little treat all for me.”
She glanced at him affectionately as she spoke. It was good of him to
tarry for her sake in this Vanity Fair of a place.
"“We were going by Calais, as you know,” said the Canon, explanatively"
to Mrs. Winstanley. “We only changed our minds a day or two ago--we
thought it would be a little surprise for you.”
power. At that a terrible feeling of hopelessness assailed him. His only
chance was to reach the valley where he had little fear of capture; but
"wounded, as he was, that seemed out of the question, and he saw himself"
caught like a rat in a trap. In an access of rage at the situation in
which he was placed he made another effort to raise himself up on his
elbow and peer through the window at the Sierras. The noise that he
"made, slight though it was, awoke the Girl. In an instant she was at his"
bedside drawing the curtain over the window.
"""What you thinkin' of?"" she asked. ""At any moment--jest as soon as the"
trail can be cleared--there'll be someone of the boys up here to see how
"I've pulled through. They mustn't see you . . ."""
"Forcibly, but with loving tenderness, she put him back among his pillows"
and seated herself by the bed. An awkward silence followed. For now that
the man was in his right senses it was borne in upon her that he might
"remember that she had fed him, given him drink and fondled him. It was a"
situation embarrassing to both. Neither knew just what to say or how to
"begin. At length, the voice from the bed spoke:"
"""How long have I been here?"""
"""Three days."""
"""And you have nursed me all that--"""
"""You mustn't talk,"" warned the girl. ""It's dangerous in more ways than"
"one. But if you keep still no one'll suspect that you're here."""
"""But I must know what happened,"" he insisted with increasing excitement."
"""I remember nothing after I came down the ladder. The Sheriff--Rance--"
"what's become . . .?"""
"""Why, it's mutiny, sir."""
"""Exactly! You can say you went out under duress."""
"""I never heard of such a thing,"" stormed the skipper. Then, more"
"quietly, ""But I don't seem to have any choice in the matter; do I?"""
"""None whatever."""
"""Tell them to go to hell!"" growled Balt from the open window above"
their head.
"A blasphemous outcry floated up from the launch, while heads protruded"
"from the deck-house openings, the faces white in the slanting glare."
"""Why don't you heave to?"" demanded a voice."
"Peasley stepped to the end of the bridge and called down: ""I can't"
"stop, my good man, they won't allow it, y' know. You'll have to bloody"
"well come aboard yourself."" Then, obedient to his command, the"
"search-light traced an arc through the darkness and died out, leaving"
"the little craft in darkness, save for its dim lantern."
"Unseen by the amazed quartermaster, who was startled out of speech and"
"action, Emerson gripped the Captain's shoulder and whispered his"
"thanks, while the Britisher grumbled under his breath:"
"""Bli' me! Won't that labor crowd be hot? They nearly bashed in my head"
"with that iron spike. Four hundred pounds! My word!"""
The sputter of the craft alongside was now punctuated by such a volley
"of curses that he raised his voice again: ""Belay that chatter, will"
"you? There's a lady aboard."""
"ruffian,"" said he to himself. ""If they have the same effect on Sallie, I"
"won't grudge the few francs I paid for them!"""
"He tiptoed down the short stairway, and, having tapped very quietly at"
"the door of the after-saloon, entered without more ado. He judged that"
he might have difficulty in gaining admission if he delayed to ask
leave.
The saloon was empty. But from an adjoining cabin came the sound of
"splashing, and from its neighbour the shuffle of heavy feet, a faint"
suggestion of deft hands busy among crisp muslin and sibilant silk.
Slyne hesitated; he wanted to be very tactful and yet was unwilling to
give up the advantage he had thus gained. He closed the door carefully
behind him. It creaked a little.
From the room whence had come the rustle of feminine garments an
"uncanny-looking figure appeared, and darted an angry, apprehensive"
glance about the saloon. The sound of splashing had ceased.
"""'Morning, Ambrizette,"" said Slyne briskly and standing his ground. ""Is"
your mistress up yet? Tell her I have Captain Dove's leave to pay her a
"call."""
"The dumb black dwarf's scowl grew darker, but her hand fell away from"
her breast and she halted as Sallie's voice sounded from within.
"""Is that you, Jasper!"" it ejaculated. ""What do you want? I thought--"""
"""I've come back--with good news for you, Sallie--wonderful news!"" said"
"Slyne. ""And I'm in no end of a hurry to be off again. Call Ambrizette in"
"and get dressed, as quick as you can. Captain Dove's waiting breakfast"
"""It is nothing to laugh at,"" grumbled Gatepath."
"""Not for you, perhaps. But to my mind the situation is gorgeous. Has"
"this man the legal right of succession?"""
"""Beyond a doubt,"" groaned Gatepath. ""His father saw to that."""
"""Then why not leave matters to take their legal course?"" asked the"
"Chief, still laughing. ""The House of Lords will be the better for a"
shock. They are a dull lot. And your lively friend will administer the
"shock all right."""
"Roger Gatepath spread out his hands in agony. ""But it is one of the"
"oldest peerages in the country, as old almost as the Barony of Arundel."
Can't you see how frightful it will be for the family if this--this
"person--is allowed to succeed?"""
"""There is no question of allowing him. If he is the legal heir he must"
succeed. The family must just put him in their pipe and smoke him. What
"else can they do?"""
"""I thought that you, with all your experience of the South, might"
suggest something. Would it not be possible to buy the man off--or might
"he not----"""
"""How can you buy him off when he is the heir? You people are nothing but"
"trustees, who must account to him for every penny. If he claims the"
"peerage and estates, you must accept him. You admit that legally he is"
"the heir. I can see what is in your mind, but it won't do, Gatepath, it"
"won't do. If you try any hanky-panky, that pretty neck of yours will"
find itself in a hempen collar. Now if it was only a case for judicious
"Hark, how the bells ring on the hillside!"
"Romantic? Yes. Mere sentimentality, mood, rhyme--nothing? Yes."
It is the last happiness.

The sun has returned. Not darkly glowing and regal--more than that:

"Here are fungi of every sort, mushrooms and puffballs. How close is the"
"poisonous mushroom to the happy family of the edible mushroom, and how"
innocently it stands there! Yet it is deadly. What magnificent cunning! A
"spurious fruit, a criminal, habitual vice itself, but preening in splendor"
"and brilliance, a very cardinal of fungi. I break off a morsel to chew; it"
"is good and soft on the tongue, but I am a coward and spit it out again."
Was it not the poisonous mushroom that drove men berserker? But in the
"dawn of our own day, we die of a hair in the throat."
"""We seem to be working toward different objectives,"" Novosty answered."

"She's gone over the edge, he told himself. She's definitely going to"
"try and screw us, either wittingly or unwittingly. But who in the room"
is going to help her? That huddled group of Russian bankers now staring
"terrified at Novosty's 9mm? Not damned likely. She's improvising, on"
her own. But her little stunt could well end up sinking the ship.
The two couriers were now spread against the brown textured fabric of
"the wall, legs apart. He walked over and reached into the leather"
"holsters at their hips, drawing out their revolvers. They were snub-"
"nosed Smith & Wesson Bodyguards, .38 caliber. He looked them over,"
"cocked them, and handed one to Eva."
"“One or two other little things,” replied Herold, judiciously. “I 'll"
copy them out and bring them to you. But go on.”
"“Well,” she said, “yesterday afternoon a little bird--I don't know what"
"kind of bird it was--came and sat on the window-sill, and turned his"
"head this way and looked at me, and turned his head that way and looked"
"at me, and I did n't move hand or foot, and I said, 'Cheep, cheep!' And"
he hopped on the bed and stayed there such a long time. And I talked
"to him, and he hopped about and looked at me and seemed to tell me all"
"sorts of wonderful things. But he did n't somehow, although he came from"
"the sky, and was a perfect dear. He must have known all about it, but he"
"did n't know how to tell me. Now, you and John come from the beautiful"
world and tell me wonderful things about it; and I shall never go there
"really, but I can live in it through you.”"
"Constable, the Great Dane, known by this abbreviated title in familiar"
"life, rose, stretched himself, and went and snuggled his head beneath"
"John's arm. John turned, his arm round the hound's neck."
"“But you can live in it through anybody, dear,” said he--“your Uncle"
"Oliver, your Aunt Julia, or anybody who comes to see you.”"
Stellamaris looked at Herold for a characteristically sympathetic
"moment, and then at John. She sighed."
"“I told you it was hard to explain. But don't you see, Belovedest? You"
and Walter are like my gull. Everybody else is like the little bird. You
"know how to tell me and make me live. The others are darlings, but they"
don't seem to know how to do it.”
John scratched his head.
"There was no one in the lobby when he arrived there--no dead bodies,"
"either. But on the sidewalk, in front of the building, a woman lay dead"
in a pool of blood.
"In a sick rage, Taber looked in both directions and saw the android dive"
through a group of people half a block away. He tipped them over like
tenpins and ran on. Taber gripped the gun tight and started in pursuit.
He could not fire because there was enough sidewalk traffic to make it
"dangerous. On ahead, the android's path was blocked by a man. He sought"
to get clear but the android passed him close enough to jam the knife
into his neck and send him screaming to the sidewalk.
"A uniformed patrolman appeared on the other side of the street, further"
down. He took the situation in and understood Taber's frantic gesture. A
"car screamed to a halt as the patrolman raced across the street, drawing"
his gun.
"The android, seeing his escape cut off, veered into an areaway. The"
patrolman got there first and plunged in after him.
"Taber, gasps tearing at his lungs, arrived thirty seconds later. During"
"that time, he'd expected the sound of shots from the patrolman's gun."
But there was silence.
"He braked on his heels, skidded into the areaway, and saw the android"
"advancing on the patrolman. The latter stood motionless, the gun hanging"
useless at his side.
"""Drop! Drop!"" Taber yelled. He cursed as he tried to angle in the narrow"
areaway in order to get a clear shot.

"""and if anything good turns up on the North-East coast, I will let you"

"Dawson went away, and the pressure of daily work and interests thrust"
"him from my mind. For a month I heard nothing of him or of Cary, and"
then one morning came a letter and a telegram. The letter was from
"Richard Cary, and read as follows: ""A queer thing has happened here."
A cruiser which had come in for repair was due to go out this morning.
"She was ready for sea the night before, the officers and crew had all"
"come back from short leave, and the working parties had cleared out."
"Then in the middle watch, when the torpedo lieutenant was testing the"
"circuits, it was discovered that all the cables leading to the guns"
"had been cut. Dawson has been called in, and bids me say that, if you"
"can come down, now is the chance of your life. I will put you up."""
"The telegram was from Dawson himself. It ran: ""They say I'm beaten."
"But I'm not. Come and see."""

I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in
"front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their"
hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's
crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government
to run ships. I felt free all over--and happy. Now was my chance to
really see the _Eleanor Roosevelt_!
*       *       *       *       *
It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and
"behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out"
"of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white"
"doors--on and on and on. _Gee_, I thought excitedly, this is _one big"
ship_!
"Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of"
stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing
that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in _The Boy
"Rocketeers_, no portholes, no visiplates, nothing."
"So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned"
"left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading"
inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix
going _purr-purr-purrty-purr_ in the comforting way big machinery has
"when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the"
way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were
portholes on the hull.
In the white track was a brilliant silver object travelling along at a
"great speed. A number of anti-aircraft guns opened fire simultaneously,"
"and all around the shining fugitive innumerable stars of pale, liquid"
gold flashed out and melted away again.
"""I bet they're puttin' 'is bloody wind up! Rotten bastard, bombin' a lot"
"o' wounded! If I get 'old of a Fritz up the line, I'll murder 'im. Yer"
"won't catch me takin' no more pris'ners, I tell yer."""
A flashing star suddenly seemed to envelop the aeroplane.
"""Got 'im that time--bloody good shot--'e's comin' down, look, look, 'e's"
"comin' down! Look, 'e's all in flames!"""
"But the aeroplane sped on, growing smaller and smaller. Then the white"
"beam swung back and was extinguished, while the guns ceased firing."
"""Fine lot o' gunners we got--couldn't 'it a Zep 'alf a yard orf! They"
"ain't worth the grub they get!"""
We returned to our marquee and sat down on our kits. My friend Private
"Black came in after us, smiling ruefully. I asked him what was the"
matter.
"""I was playing the piano in the Sergeants' Mess when the first one"
dropped. We all jumped up together and rushed out. Then the second one
burst and I lost my head and didn't know where I was going. I darted to
"and fro, tripping over tent-ropes and dashing up against revetments. I"
"never had the wind up so much in all my life. I couldn't get my breath,"
there was a kind of weight on my stomach and a tightness round my chest
"and throat, and my knees kept on giving way all the time. The third one"
burst and I fell down and crawled under some ropes and lay flat against
"""Oh, I don't know,"" Sidney laughed. ""I'm all mixed up. I guess I was"
"trying to say something Mr. Dugald said once to me."""
"""Oh, _Dug_!"" laughed Pola. ""He's nutty about all that! Look at the way"
he lives here on the Cape. But mother says he'll get over it when he
marries. Now I have no intention of getting serious this grand day so
"let's have another piece of that chocolate fudge cake--it's on me, too,"
"remember!"" Which was Pola's pretty way of pretending she did not know"
that Sidney did not have any money with her. The dollar Sidney had
earned for posing had long since been spent.
"Sidney was relieved that Pola had rescued her from the ""deep water."" At"
the same time she suffered from the sense that she had not made Pola
see Mart in another light. She had failed in loyalty. The sparkling
blue of the bay that stretched before them only reminded her that this
"was the hour she usually went swimming. Due to Pola's ""complex"" she had"
not gone swimming for a whole week.
"Even with her mouth full of the fudge cake, she vowed to herself that"
the very next day she would hunt out her chums and her old pastimes.
Pola and Mr. Dugald must plan without her!
She had promised to dine again at the hotel with Pola and her mother
but as soon as she could after dinner she returned to Sunset Lane.
Because of her determination her heart was lighter. And her way was
"made easier, too, for Mrs. Allan had told Pola at dinner that the"
"""Truxtons were at Chatham Bars."" Pola had been as excited over the"
Truxtons as her mother.
"""Can we go and see them right away?"""
"""Not tonight. But I have arranged for a car and Shields will drive us"
dismay. For some reason she could not understand she had offended Mart.
And Pola had snubbed her. It had indeed been a cruel fate that had
brought Pola out on the wharf at that precise moment!
"She spent a lonely afternoon in Top Notch, too miserable to even pour"
"out her heart to ""Dorothea."" Then she helped Aunt Achsa prepare supper"
"and after supper, which was lonely, too, for neither Lavender nor Mr."
"Dugald were there, she insisted upon clearing up the dishes while Aunt"
Achsa went down to Tillie Higgins'.
Swishing her hands in the soapy water Sidney pondered sadly the things
she had longed to learn of Pola. Her name--why she hadn't even found
out her name! What had her teacher said of that theme she had written
on her visit to the Romley house? Where did Pola live? Of course she
might see her again--Pola had said that they'd be in Provincetown for a
"few days, but she did not _want_ to see her; she did not want Pola to"
see Sunset Lane and the little gray cottage and Aunt Achsa and
Lavender. Pola would laugh at them and she would hate her!
At that moment footsteps crunched the gravel of the path and a shadow
fell across the kitchen door. Sidney turned from the table. There stood
Mr. Dugald and with him--Pola.
"""I've brought my cousin, Sidney. She blew out to the Cape with that"
ill-wind we felt this morning. If you know what we can do with her I'll
"be your slave for life."""
Playfully pushing Dugald Allan aside Pola walked into the kitchen.
"""Isn't he horrid? You wouldn't dream that he's really crazy about me,"
"would you? I told him how we'd met, even before this morning. He'd"
written home that Miss Green's cousin was here but I never dreamed it
*       *       *       *       *
"Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. ""Notice! Passengers"
"not permitted past this point!"" A big sign in red."
I peeked around the corner. I knew it--the next deck was the hull. I
"could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the"
velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed
existed in the Universe.
"There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this"
"distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely."
If I just took one quick look....
But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently.
"Then I saw the big red sign again. ""Passengers not permitted--"""
Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth
"Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And"
didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to
get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the
"careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to"
men.
"""Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You"
"can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth"
"Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this"
"clause--'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family,"
this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations
"pertaining'--and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that"
you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs.
"No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men."""
"She looked at me keenly, and I fancied her colour rose. But she only"
"answered, 'Yes, Martin. But you see I have not one. I am alone.'"
"'And lonely, my lady?'"
"'Sometimes,' she answered, smiling sadly."
"'But this evening?' I replied, feeling that there was still something"
I did not understand. 'I should not have thought you would be feeling
"that way. I have not been here, but when I came in, my lady----'"
"'Pshaw!' she answered with a laugh of disdain. 'Those boys, Martin?"
"They can laugh, fight, and ride; but for the rest, pouf! They are not"
"company. However, it is bedtime, and you must go. I think you have"
"done me good. Good night. I wish--I wish I could do you good,' she"
"added kindly, almost timidly."
To some extent she had. I went away feeling that mine was not the only
"trouble in the world, nor my loneliness the only loneliness. She was a"
"stranger in a besieged city, a woman among men, exposed, despite her"
"rank, to many of a woman's perils; and doubtless she had felt Fraulein"
Max's defection and the Waldgrave's strange conduct more deeply than
any one watching her daily bearing would have supposed. So much the
"greater reason was there that I should do my duty loyally, and putting"
"her first to whom I owed so much, let no sorrow of my own taint my"
service.
But God knows there is one passion that defies argument. The house
next Herr Krapp's had a fascination for me which I could not resist;
"and though I did not again leave my lady unguarded, but arranged that"
"Steve should stop at home and watch the door, four o'clock the next"
afternoon saw me sneaking away in search of St. Austin's. Of course I
He intended to make sure it didn't. The planning had been split-second
up until now; this was no moment to relax his guard.
"Yes, it was good he was here. As he studied Comrade Karanova, he"
realized that something about her was still making him uneasy. So far
"it was merely a hunch, but his hunches had been right more often than"
he liked to think.
He tried to push the feeling aside. Probably just paranoia. She
"obviously was here today for the same reason he was, to make sure the"
Soviet money was returned safely. She probably was also still worried
"about the protocol, but that problem was hers, not his. From today on,"
the KGB would have to work out their in-fighting back home the best way
they could. The ground rules were changing fast in Moscow.
"Besides, Dzerzhinsky Square was about to become part of a previous life"
"for him. If he could just clear this up, get his commission, he'd be"
set. Forever. Enough was enough. Maybe he'd end up in the Caribbean
"like Michael, drinking margaritas and counting string bikinis."
The elevator door opened. Facing them were Michael Vance and Eva
Borodin.
"""Glad you could make it."" Vance glanced coldly at Vera. ""Right on time."
"The money arrives in exactly seven minutes."""
"She nodded a silent greeting, pulling her sable coat tighter as she"
strode past. The bank officials lined up along the corridor watched her
"with nervous awe. Even in London, T-Directorate brass had clout."
They moved as a group down the long carpeted hallway leading to the
"counting room. On this floor everything was high-security, with"
"""Mr. Vance."" Vera Karanova watched as the two security men unlatched"
their satchels and began withdrawing the bundles of open cashiers
"checks and bearer bonds. ""I want to recount these securities, now."""
"""There're double-counted tallys already prepared""--he pointed toward the"
"bundles--""yesterday by the main branch of Moscow Narodny. The printouts"
"are attached."""
"""That was their count,"" she replied. ""I intend to make my own, before"
"we go any further."""
"Which means time lost, he thought. Doesn't she realize we've got to get"
"this cash recycled, those bonds purchased and in place, before Tanzan"
Mino's _kobun _have a chance to move on us? If the deal to acquire
"Ken's new Mino Industries debentures doesn't go through, giving us"
something to hold over the godfather's head . . .
She's literally playing into his hands.
"""The instruments are all here, all negotiable, and all ready to go,"" he"
"said, stealing a quick glance toward Eva. One look at her eyes told him"
"she also sensed trouble brewing. ""Now, we're damn well going to move"
"and move fast. We credit the funds here, then wire them to Westminster"
"Union. And by God we do it immediately."""
"""Mr. Vance, you are no longer giving the orders,"" she replied sharply."
"""I'm in charge here now. As a matter of fact, I have no intention of"
wiring the money anywhere. There will be no purchase of debentures. As
"far as I'm concerned, it has now been returned."" She paused for"
"emphasis. ""But first we will count it."""
"pitiful to hear. And the castle was hung with black, and in the whole"
kingdom proclamation was made from all pulpits that whoever could help
"the king's daughter should get her, and half the kingdom besides. Then"
"Tom, Dick and Harry, and the best physicians in the country came along."
But none of them could help the princess.
But one day a foreign doctor from afar came to court. He was not from
"their country, he said, and had made the journey purposely just to try"
"his luck here. But he must see the king's daughter alone, said he, and"
permission was granted him.
"The king's daughter recognized him, and grew red and pale in turn. ""If"
"I help you now, will you marry me?"" asked the youth. Yes, indeed she"
"would. Then he gave her one of the magic apples, and her horns were only"
"half as large as before. ""But I cannot do more until I have my cap,"
"and my table-cloth, and my purse back again,"" said he. So she went and"
"brought him the things. Then he gave her still another magic apple, and"
"now the horns were no more than tiny hornlets. ""But now I cannot go on"
"until you have sworn that you will be true to me,"" said he. And she"
"swore that she would. And after she had eaten the third apple, her"
"forehead was quite smooth again, and she was even more beautiful than"
in days gone by.
Then there was great joy in the castle. They prepared for the wedding
"with baking and brewing, and invited people from East and West to come"
"to it. And they ate and drank, and were merry and of good cheer, and if"
"they have not stopped, they are merry and of good cheer to this very"
day!
NOTE
CHAPTER XXIII.
THE FLIGHT.
"One of the men--it was I--muttered something to Marie, and she snuffed"
"the wick, and blew up the light. In a moment it filled the room,"
"disclosing a strange medley of levelled weapons, startled faces, and"
flashing eyes. In one corner Fraulein Max and the two women cowered
"behind one another, trembling and staring. At the table sat my lady,"
"with dull, dazed eyes, looking on, yet scarcely understanding what was"
"happening. On either side of her stood Steve and I, covering the"
"general with our pistols, while the Waldgrave, who was still too weak"
"for much exertion, kept guard at the door."
"Tzerclas was the first to speak. 'What is this foolery?' he said,"
scowling unutterable curses at us. 'What does this mean?'
"'This!' I said, producing a piece of hide rope. 'We are going to tie"
"you up. If you struggle, general, you die. If you submit, you live."
"That is all. Go to work, Steve.'"
"There was a gleam in Tzerclas' eye, which warned me to stand back and"
"crook my finger. His face was black with fury, and for an instant I"
thought that he would spring upon us and dare all. But prudence and
"the pistols prevailed. With an evil look he sat still, and in a trice"
Steve had a loop round his arms and was binding him to the heavy
chair.
I knew then that as far as he was concerned we were safe; and I turned
"to bid the women get cloaks and food, adjuring them to be quick, since"
"rights, huggin’ a bunch o’ calico in de hot-house. She side-stepped in"
to pull some posies and yer was squeezin’ de oder gal to beat de band.
"She says it looked cute, all right all right, but it made her sick. She"
"says yer better git busy, and make a sneak for de train.”"
The young man gave a low whistle and his eyes flashed with a sudden
"thought. His hand flew to the inside pocket of his coat, and drew out a"
"handful of letters. Selecting one, he handed it to the boy, following"
it with a silver dollar from his vest-pocket.
"“Give that letter to the lady,” he said, “and ask her to read it. Tell"
"her that it should explain the situation. Tell her that, if she had"
"mingled a little trust with her conception of the ideal, much heartache"
might have been avoided. Tell her that the loyalty she prizes so much
has never wavered. Tell her I am waiting for an answer.”
The messenger stood before the lady.
“De gent says he’s had de ski-bunk put on him widout no cause. He says
"he’s no bum guy; and, lady, yer read dat letter, and I’ll bet yer he’s"
"a white sport, all right.”"
"The young lady unfolded the letter; somewhat doubtfully, and read it."
Dear Dr. Arnold:   I want to thank you for your most kind and opportune
"aid to my daughter last Friday evening, when she was overcome by an"
attack of her old heart-trouble in the conservatory at Mrs. Waldron’s
reception. Had you not been near to catch her as she fell and to render
"proper attention, we might have lost her. I would be glad if you would"
call and undertake the treatment of her case.
"for some word of Lavender, but the words failed in her throat. Cold,"
"forlorn, hungry, she crept to her room, threw off her clothes and"
huddled down into the bed-clothes.
"They would all blame her--Miss Vine and Mr. Dugald, Aunt Achsa, Doctor"
Blackwell. Probably now Pola would have more complexes to suffer;
Pola's mother would be angry and they could never be friends again. And
Mart--Aunt Achsa had said old Mrs. Calkins could be terrible when she
"was ""worked up!"" Even if Lavender lived Aunt Achsa would never forgive"
her and if he _didn't_ live--Mr. Dugald had said he was fighting. Those
boards creaking faintly meant that Doctor Blackwell and Aunt Achsa were
helping Lavender fight. Dear old Lav with his fine dreams!
The desperate longing for Trude shook her. She sobbed into her pillow.
And yet the longing brought only added remorse. Trude would scold her.
Trude would take her home. That meant stinging humiliation. How Vick
would laugh at her when everything was over. A case of rum! Sidney
writhed under the soft covers.
Somewhere boards creaked again--Lavender's fight. Sidney pictured the
doctor and Aunt Achsa bending over him. And outside everything was so
"quiet and gray. That was the way death probably came, Sidney thought."
On the morrow they would send her home--in disgrace. She might not even
"be allowed to see Lavender, or Mart, or Pola--or Mr. Dugald. Someone"
would telegraph to Trude and Trude would meet her back at Middletown.
"She would live a long, sad life of penance behind the crumbing stone"
wall she had so detested.
But the thought of the wall and the shelter of the old house brought
such a surcease of torment that the girl had fallen into a heavy sleep.
When she wakened it was to a consciousness of bright sunshine--and
"""No, you have a problem."" She examined him confidently. ""Because if"
"those materials are not returned to us, we will be forced to take"
"actions you may find harsh."""
"""Give it your best shot,"" he went on, glancing at Eva and hoping they"
"could keep up the bravado, ""because we've got a few cards in our hand"
too. Forget the money--that's history now--but we could still be in a
"position to blow your whole project sky high."""
"""You two are the only ones outside our organization who know about the"
"protocol. That knowledge will not be allowed to go any farther."""
"""Don't be so sure. For all you know, we've already stashed a copy"
"somewhere. Left word that if anything happens to either one of us, the"
package gets sent to the papers. Made public. Think what some premature
"headlines would do for your little project."""
"""We have thought about it, Mr. Vance. That contingency has been"
"covered."""
"""Well, if I don't know what the other player's got, I tend to trust my"
"own cards."""
But why play at all? he suddenly found himself musing. Fold this hand
and go for the next move.
"Before leaving Crete he'd transmitted a copy of the protocol, still in"
"its encrypted form, to his office computer in Nassau. At the time it'd"
merely seemed like prudence; now it might turn out to be a lifeline.
One phone call and it could be transmitted back here this very
afternoon. The magic of satellites in space. Knock out another quick
"alone!"""
"""Oh, yes, I can,"" she murmured. ""I always make things alone!"""
"I tried to fathom the meaning of this, but gave it up and started to go"
"on deck. If I could take her father off to one side and explain, well"
and good. He would perhaps sympathize with my mistake when he understood
that it was partially the result of a desire to fill Monsieur with
"spirits. Considering this, I spoiled everything by asking:"
"""What does he look like?"""
"""My father?"" she gasped, in a wondering way."
"""No--yes--certainly not! I mean--oh, this is intolerable! I don't know"
"your father, never saw him in my life--unless he was the one with you"
last night when you drove me frantic with that ball of paper trick! But
what you did has nothing to do with my being here. I've not wilfully
followed. A stupid boatman mistook your yacht for my own when I was--I
"mean to say, when I was too engrossed with the memory of you to notice"
"his mistake."""
"From alarm her look gave way to wonderment, then almost to mirth. It was"
"a hard place for a girl to be in, and I expected her to leave me now,"
find the old chap and promptly have me hanged to a yard-arm. The fact
that there are no yard-arms on schooner yachts made no difference. And I
"do believe she was considering that when a sailor passed us, looking"
enough like Tommy to have been his twin brother.
"""Jack,"" she said to him, ""tell Mr. Graham to come below!"""
"The fellow saluted and left, and I stared at her in surprise, saying:"
"world. He and I were raised here in New York, just like two brothers,"
together. I was eighteen and Jimmy was twenty. The next morning I was
to start for the West to make my fortune. You couldn’t have dragged
"Jimmy out of New York; he thought it was the only place on earth. Well,"
we agreed that night that we would meet here again exactly twenty years
"from that date and time, no matter what our conditions might be or from"
what distance we might have to come. We figured that in twenty years
"each of us ought to have our destiny worked out and our fortunes made,"
whatever they were going to be.”
"“It sounds pretty interesting,” said the policeman. “Rather a long time"
"between meets, though, it seems to me. Haven’t you heard from your"
friend since you left?”
"“Well, yes, for a time we corresponded,” said the other. “But after a"
"year or two we lost track of each other. You see, the West is a pretty"
"big proposition, and I kept hustling around over it pretty lively. But"
"I know Jimmy will meet me here if he’s alive, for he always was the"
"truest, stanchest old chap in the world. He’ll never forget. I came a"
"thousand miles to stand in this door to-night, and it’s worth it if my"
old partner turns up.”
"The waiting man pulled out a handsome watch, the lids of it set with"
small diamonds.
"“Three minutes to ten,” he announced. “It was exactly ten o’clock when"
we parted here at the restaurant door.”
"“Did pretty well out West, didn’t you?” asked the policeman."
"“You bet! I hope Jimmy has done half as well. He was a kind of plodder,"
"though, good fellow as he was. I’ve had to compete with some of the"
removed from the trunk of your family tree. He had only the faintest
tinge of blue blood in his veins. He was an absolute outsider. We'll
"hear no more about _him_ now."""
"""You mean that it's an absolutely sure thing for her,"" Captain Dove"
"suggested, and Mr. Jobling looked pained."
"""I can't afford to risk anything on uncertainties, sir,"" he answered"
"stiffly. ""And I'll stake my professional reputation on--"""
"""Oh, never mind about all that,"" Slyne broke in, folding his share of"
"the papers together and pocketing them. ""The syndicate's safely floated."
And now--as to our next move.
"""You'd better get away back to Genoa by the five o'clock train, Dove."
And you must take Ambrizette with you; I'll get Sal--Lady Josceline
another maid in Paris--one who won't attract quite so much attention to
us as that damned dwarf would.
"""Jobling and I will go on there by the night-mail, on our way to London"
with--Lady Josceline. You can take the _Olive Branch_ round to some safe
"English port and lay her up there in the meantime. As soon as you land,"
you can rejoin us--at Jobling's address. By that time we'll probably be
"ready to redeem our note to you."""
"""By that time,"" Captain Dove returned with concentrated bitterness,"
"""you'll have found some way to give me the slip altogether. D'ye take me"
"for a blind idiot, Slyne? D'ye think I'm going to let Sallie out of my"
"sight, with you?"""
"Slyne was visibly disconcerted. ""But--aren't you going to take your ship"
"round to England?"" he asked, in genuine surprise. ""You can't very well"
"and saw, a hundred yards or so away, a bent and dreary figure trudging"
down the metal paving of the street. It was a figure like those to be
"seen on Earth, which placed it as belonging to Greca's race."
"The tall leader drew forth one of the shock-tubes. Seen near at hand,"
it was observed to be bafflingly simple in appearance. It seemed
devoid of all mechanism--simply a tube of reddish metal with a sort of
handle formed of a coil of heavy wire.
The Rogan pointed the tube at the distant figure.
"Greca screamed, and screamed again. Coincident with her cry, as though"
"the sound of it had felled him, the distant slave dropped to the"
pavement.
*       *       *       *       *
That was all. The tube had merely been pointed: as far as Brand could
"see, the Rogan's ""hand"" had not moved on the barrel of the tube, nor"
even constricted about the coil of wire that formed its handle. Yet
"that distant figure had dropped. Furthermore, fumes of greasy black"
smoke now began to arise from the huddled body; and in less than
thirty seconds there was left no trace of it on the gleaming metal
pavement.
"""So that's what those things are like at full power!"" breathed Dex."
"""My God!"""
"The Rogan leader spoke a few words. Greca, huddled despairingly on the"
"floor, crushed by this brutal annihilation of one of her country-men"
"before her very eyes, did not translate. But translation was"
"unnecessary. The Rogan's icy, triumphant eyes, the very posture of"
"distance glimmered the sea, and by a rock upon the hillside, armed"
"men, a knot of spears, shone like spirit sentinels athwart the west."
"Mists were creeping up the valleys, as the sun went down into the sea."
A few sparse stars gleamed out like souls still tortured by the
mysteries of life. An inevitable pessimism seemed to challenge the
"universe, taking for its parable the weird afterglow of the west."
Deep in the woods a voice sang wild and solitary in the gathering
"gloom. Like the cry of a ghost, it seemed to set the silence"
"quivering, the leaves quaking with windless awe. The men who looked"
"towards the sea heard it, a song that echoed in the heart like woe."
The duke pointed into the darkening wood.
"""Trust your own heart: self is the man! Through a mistaken sense of"
duty have you been brought nigh unto death and despair! Trust not in
"sophistry: the laws of men are carven upon stone, the laws of Heaven"
"upon the heart! Be strong! From henceforth, scorn mere words! Trample"
"tradition in the dust! Trust yourself, and the God in your heart!"""
The distant voice had sunk into silence. Francesco listened for it
with hands aloft.
"""I must go,"" he said."
"""Go!""--"
"""I must be near her through the night!"""
"""The moon stands full upon the hills! I will await you here!"""
"Dim were the woods that autumn evening, dim and deep with an ecstasy"
But when in her mirror she saw him standing behind her--he had crept into
the bedroom like a cat--fierceness came into her.  She could see the
"blood rush up in her own white face, and, turning round she said:"
"""No, Gustav, go out to the music-room if you want a companion."""
"He recoiled against the foot of the bed and stared at her haggardly, and"
"Gyp, turning back to her mirror, went on quietly taking the pins out of"
"her hair.  For fully a minute she could see him leaning there, moving his"
"head and hands as though in pain. Then, to her surprise, he went.  And a"
vague feeling of compunction mingled with her sense of deliverance.  She
"lay awake a long time, watching the fire-glow brighten and darken on the"
"ceiling, tunes from ""The Tales of Hoffmann"" running in her head; thoughts"
"and fancies crisscrossing in her excited brain.  Falling asleep at last,"
"she dreamed she was feeding doves out of her hand, and one of them was"
"Daphne Wing.  She woke with a start.  The fire still burned, and by its"
"light she saw him crouching at the foot of the bed, just as he had on"
"their wedding-night--the same hungry yearning in his face, and an arm"
"outstretched.  Before she could speak, he began:"
"""Oh, Gyp, you don't understand!  All that is nothing--it is only you I"
want--always.  I am a fool who cannot control himself. Think!  It's a
"long time since you went away from me."""
"Gyp said, in a hard voice:"
"""I didn't want to have a child."""
He said quickly:
"""No; but now you have it you are glad.  Don't be unmerciful, my Gyp!  It"
is like you to be merciful.  That girl--it is all over--I swear--I
"""Won't you sit down?"" he suggested with debonair courtesy."
But she shook her head; she was evidently afraid to receive him on any
such friendly footing. She did not even care to ask him what he was
doing in evening dress at breakfast-time and on board the _Olive
Branch_. But in her troubled eyes he could read that unspoken inquiry.
"""I've been travelling all night to get back to you, Sallie,"" he told"
"her, in a low, eager tone, ""and I hadn't time to change--I was in such a"
hurry to tell you the news. I've come to take you away from the _Olive
"Branch_,--and Captain Dove. I've come to set you free."""
"She stared at him as though she had not heard aright, her lips parted,"
"her eyebrows arched, a faint, puzzled, questioning frown on her"
forehead.
"""I've come to set you free,"" he said again."
"""At what price?"" she asked suddenly, with disconcerting directness, and"
his would-be straightforward glance wavered.
"""Don't put it that way!"" he urged. ""I ask no more than the fulfilment of"
"the promise you made me. And--listen, Sallie. I've found out who you"
really are and where your home is. I'll take you there if only you--
"""I'm not asking you to marry me right away, either, remember. All you"
must do in the meantime is to sign without question some papers that
will be required. Then I'll make everything quite safe for you and take
"you to your own home."""
The quick doubt in her eyes had given place to an expression of helpless
amazement and growing dismay. But he did not wait to hear anything she
house and garden. Surely you could be happy in—in—appreciating it for a
change. Or you could take up some hobby.”
"And Lola the baby had chimed in loftily, “All men ought to have"
hobbies. It makes life impossible if they haven’t.”
"Well, well! He couldn’t help a grim smile as painfully he began to"
climb the hill that led into Harcourt Avenue. Where would Lola and her
"sisters and Charlotte be if he’d gone in for hobbies, he’d like to"
"know? Hobbies couldn’t pay for the town house and the seaside bungalow,"
"and their horses, and their golf, and the sixty-guinea gramophone in"
the music-room for them to dance to. Not that he grudged them these
"things. No, they were smart, good-looking girls, and Charlotte was a"
remarkable woman; it was natural for them to be in the swim. As a
"matter of fact, no other house in the town was as popular as theirs; no"
"other family entertained so much. And how many times old Mr. Neave,"
"pushing the cigar box across the smoking-room table, had listened to"
"praises of his wife, his girls, of himself even."
"“You’re an ideal family, sir, an ideal family. It’s like something one"
reads about or sees on the stage.”
"“That’s all right, my boy,” old Mr. Neave would reply. “Try one of"
those; I think you’ll like them. And if you care to smoke in the
"garden, you’ll find the girls on the lawn, I dare say.”"
"That was why the girls had never married, so people said. They could"
have married anybody. But they had too good a time at home. They were
"too happy together, the girls and Charlotte. H’m, h’m! Well, well."
Perhaps so....
By this time he had walked the length of fashionable Harcourt Avenue;
get the Marines to teach you--he asked no questions. With one word he
"called the guard to attention, and himself saluted me--me a private! I"
handed him my rifle--there was an inch of blood at the point of the
"bayonet--and hobbled off to the nearest ladder. My word, I could"
"scarcely walk, and as for climbing a ship's ladder--I could never have"
done if some one hadn't given me a boost behind and some one else a
hand at the top. The Commander and the Major of Marines were both in
"the wardroom; I walked in, saluted them as a self-respecting private"
"should do, and told them the whole story."""
"""It was Petty Officer Trehayne,"" said I calmly--and waited for a"
sensation.
"""Of course,"" replied Dawson, greatly to my annoyance. He might have"
"shown some astonishment at my wonderful intuition; but he didn't, not"
"a scrap. Even Cary was at first disappointing, though he warmed up"
"later, and did me full justice. ""Trehayne a spy!"" cried Cary. ""He"
"looked a smart good man."""
"""I am not saying that he wasn't,"" snapped Dawson, whose nerves were"
"very badly on edge. ""He was obeying the orders of his superiors as we"
"all have to do. He gave his life, and it was for his country's"
service. Nobody can do more than that. Don't you go for to slander
"Trehayne. I watched him die--on his feet."""
"Cary turned to me. ""What made you think it was Trehayne?"" he asked."
"This was better. I looked at Dawson, who was brooding in his chair"
with his thoughts far away. He was still seeing those eyes fading out
under the glare of the electrics between the steel decks of the
_Malplaquet_!
"""It was a sheer guess at first,"" said I, preserving a decent show of"
"we are beginning to quarrel, Everard? It is slightly vulgar. I am your"
"oldest friend, remember, and I am trying to acquit myself of a painful"
duty to you.”
"“Duty is one of the chief instruments of the devil, if you will excuse"
"my saying so,” replied the Canon."
"“Oh, very well then, Everard,” she said hotly. “You can go on being"
a fool as long as you like. I saw your wife struggling in this man’s
"embrace, more or less, this morning. Two or three strange coincidences"
have been forced upon my notice. For your sake I have been excessively
"anxious. My conscience tells me I ought to take you into my confidence,"
and I can do no more. You can see the Christian name of this Bazouge
"in the Visitors’ List, and adopt what course of action you think fit."
I wash my hands of the whole matter. And I must say that from the very
"beginning, two years ago, you have treated me all through with the"
greatest want of consideration.”
The Canon did not heed the peroration. He stood with the flimsy sheet
"clenched in his hand and regarded her sternly. She shrank a little, for"
her soul seemed to be naked.
“You have tried to ferret this out through spite against Yvonne. Whether
"the horrible thing you imply is true or not, I shall find it hard to"
forgive you.”
"Mrs. Winstanley shrugged her shoulders. “In either case, you will come"
"to your senses, I hope. Meanwhile, considering the present relations, it"
might be pleasanter not to meet at dinner to-night.”
"“I am sorry to have to agree with you, Emmeline,” said the Canon."
must have an army in here. Ned was coaxed away by a fake note; Jimmie
"went to find Ned and got lost himself, and we go out to answer a call"
for help and get mixed up with a lot of half-breeds. I guess we’ll have
to take a company of state troops with us next time we go camping.”
"“Well, let’s be moving,” urged Frank. “Those fellows’ heads will be just"
sore enough when they quit rolling to shoot at anything in sight. They’d
string us up if they caught us now.”
"In accordance with this reasoning, the boys turned south in the thicket"
"then shifted to the east, then whirled back in a northerly direction. At"
one time they heard the shouts of the half-breeds on the slope far away
to the south.
"“They think we kept right on south,” laughed Jack. “Now,” he went on,"
"“we’ll walk north a long ways, climb the slope to the snow line, and"
come out on the camp from above. How’s that strike you boys?”
"“It listens good to me,” Frank answered. “Do you suppose Ned is back"
there yet?” he continued.
"“It struck me,” Jack replied, “that the half-breeds we encountered were"
out looking for Ned or Jimmie.”
"“You’ll have to guess again,” Harry put in. “The ginks we encountered"
were stationed there to catch any Boy Scout who came in answer to that
signal. That’s some more of the work of that crooked messenger.”
"“Well, I hope the bears won’t devour Gilroy while we’re gone,” Frank"
suggested. “It’s likely to be night before we get back.”
"The boys walked for a long distance, and it was three o’clock by their"
"""And what's more,"" said Slyne, playing a trump card with great outward"
"indifference, ""you can make him pay you for your time instead of you"
paying him. I told you I came back here to do you a good turn. There's
more than a hundred thousand dollars of easy money for you in this
deal--if you go the right way about it.
"""But--don't take my word for anything."""
Captain Dove had palpable difficulty in suppressing the obvious repartee
to that last bit of advice. But cupidity and cunning kept him quiet for
a space.
"""All right. I'll go with you,"" he agreed very gruffly at last. And Slyne"
heaved a silent sigh of relief; he had feared more than once that the
contest of wills would after all go against him.
"""You're wise,"" he commented carelessly. ""It will pay you."
"""You'd better see Sallie now, don't you think, and tell her--"""
"""I'm not going to interfere between you and her--till I get my money"
"from you,"" declared the old man with a crafty grin. ""You must tackle her"
"yourself. She'll be up by now, but breakfast won't be ready for half an"
hour. If I were you I'd take that coat off and let her have a sight of
"those diamonds of yours."""
"Slyne did not wait to hear any more. He was already on his way aft, a"
somewhat incongruous figure on the decks of the _Olive Branch_. When he
reached the companion-hatch on the poop he was smiling sardonically.
"""I do believe it was my 'diamonds' that finally fetched that old"
"""Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you"
know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing
"on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you"
"know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and"
your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific
"stock, too."""
"I was so excited I just had to yell: ""Gee, Sis, say _yes_!"""
*       *       *       *       *
"My sister's voice was steaming with scorn. ""And what makes you think"
"that I'd consider you a desirable husband?"""
"He spread his hands genially. ""Figure if you wanted a poodle, you're"
pretty enough to pick one up on Earth. Figure if you charge off to
"Venus, you don't want a poodle, you want a man. I'm one. I own three"
islands in the Galertan Archipelago that'll be good oozing mudgrape
land when they're cleared. Not to mention the rich berzeliot beds
offshore. I got no bad habits outside of having my own way. I'm also
"passable good-looking for a slaptoe planter. Besides, if you marry"
me you'll be the first mated on this ship--and that's a splash most
"nesting females like to make."""
There was a longish stretch of quiet. Sis stepped back and measured him
slowly with her eyes; there was a lot to look at. He waited patiently
while she covered the distance from his peculiar green boots to that
head of hair. I was so excited I was gulping instead of breathing.
Imagine having Butt for a brother-in-law and living on a wet-plantation
in Flatfolk country!
But then I remembered Sis's level head and I didn't have much hope any
"""Yes. He is coming up soon for instructions. It's his last chance, as"
it is mine. He sees that he must be held responsible for the wire
"cutting in the _Antinous_, and to some slight extent also in the"
"_Antigone_, and that if anything goes wrong with the _Malplaquet_ he"
"will be dismissed. I shall be sorry to lose him, for he is an"
"exceptionally good man, but we can't allow failures in petty officer"
"detectives any more than we can in chief inspectors."""
"""Where does Trehayne come from? His name sounds Cornish,"" I asked."
"""Falmouth, I believe. He is quite young, but he has had nearly three"
years in the _Vernon_ at Portsmouth and in the torpedo factory at
Greenock. A first-class engineer and electrician and a sound
detective. He has been with me for some twelve months. You will see
"him if he calls soon."""
I had been thinking hard over the details of Dawson's plans while the
"talk went on, and then ventured to offer some comments."
"""It is fortunate that you have grown a moustache since you were in the"
"north; you could not have been a Marine as a clean-shaven man."""
"""I often have to shave it,"" said Dawson, ""but I always grow it again"
between whiles. One can take it off quicker than one can put it on
again. False hair is the devil; I have never used it yet and never
will. So whenever I have a spell of leisure I grow a moustache against
"emergencies--like this one."""
"My next comment was rather difficult to make, for I did not wish"
"either Cary or Dawson to divine its purpose. ""If I may make a"
suggestion to a man of your experience it would be that none of your
whilst I settle the bill and ask for food for the journey. The brown
woman fishes out from a huge black pot in the background sundry hunks of
"coarse boiled pork, and gives me two of these, hot, with bread and salt."
This is the luncheon. I pay the bill: which amounts to twenty-four
"francs, for everything. (One says francs or liras, irrespective, in"
"Italy.) At that moment arrives the train from Cagliari, and men rush in,"
"roaring for the soup--or rather, for the broth. ""Ready, ready!"" she"
"cries, going to the black pot."
V.
TO SORGONO.
"The various trains in the junction squatted side by side and had long,"
long talks before at last we were off. It was wonderful to be running in
"the bright morning towards the heart of Sardinia, in the little train"
"that seemed so familiar. We were still going third class, rather to the"
disgust of the railway officials at Mandas.
"At first the country was rather open: always the long spurs of hills,"
"steep-sided, but not high. And from our little train we looked across"
"the country, across hill and dale. In the distance was a little town, on"
"a low slope. But for its compact, fortified look it might have been a"
town on the English downs. A man in the carriage leaned out of the
"window holding out a white cloth, as a signal to someone in the far off"
"town that he was coming. The wind blew the white cloth, the town in the"
distance glimmered small and alone in its hollow. And the little train
pelted along.
and talking together. They were greatly agitated.
The old woman sniffed and wiped her eyes. The elder daughter was
"packing a few things in a bundle. One of the officers asked: ""What about"
"our coffee?"" but she took no notice. Her sister had gone out in search"
of further information.
"She soon returned. Yes, they would all have to leave at once, but, if"
"they liked to take the risk, they could come back to-morrow with a"
"wagon, if they could get one, and fetch their belongings."
They were comforted. They knew where they would be able to get a wagon.
They would cart their stock and their household property away on the
morrow. They would start another estaminet somewhere. They would suffer
"loss and inconvenience, but they would not be ruined--their valuable"
stock of wines would save them from that.
The bundle was made up and they prepared to leave. We paid our bill and
went out into the street. Numbers of soldiers were straggling past. They
looked wretched and exhausted. Their boots and puttees were caked with
mud. They had neither rifles nor packs. Three men were lying up against
"a garden wall. We asked them for news. They could not tell us much,"
except that the Germans were still advancing.
"""We was at Dickebusch when 'e started slingin' stuff over--gorblimy, 'e"
don't 'alf wallop yer--umpteen of our mates got bleed'n' well biffed. We
"cleared out afore it got too 'ot."""
"Several famished ""battle-stragglers"" had entered our camp in order to"
beg for food. They sat round the cook-house and ate in gloomy silence.
In the adjoining field a number of tents had sprung up. Blue figures
"Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb"
"things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what _Women_"
like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting
"married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her"
wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.
"Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do"
"with me. I knew what Sis could say to _that_, but at least it was an"
argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.
"I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to"
"the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the"
"movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding"
"off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it"
must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose
"against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off,"
Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!
"Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of"
blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the
"wall in glowing red letters were the words, ""Lifeboat 47. Passengers:"
"Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!"""
Another one of those signs.
*       *       *       *       *
I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out
the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked
under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get
into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I
clover; and that was the reason he had the second sight. He could see
"those who are invisible, but they could not see him."
"And as he was sitting there in the forward cabin, he heard voices"
"within the ship. He peered through a crack, and there were three"
"coal-black crows sitting inside the deck-beams, and they were talking"
"about their husbands. All three were tired of them, and were planning"
"their death. One could see at once that they were witches, who had"
assumed another form.
"""But is it certain that there is no one here who can overhear us?"" said"
one of the crows. And by the way she spoke the cabin-boy knew her for
the captain's wife.
"""No, you can see there's not,"" said the others, the wives of the first"
"and second quartermasters. ""There is not a soul aboard."""
"""Well, then I do not mind saying that I know of a good way to get rid of"
"them,"" said the captain's wife once more, and hopped closer to the two"
"others. ""We will turn ourselves into breakers, wash them into the sea,"
"and sink the ship with every man on board."""
"That pleased the others, and they sat there a long time discussing the"
"day and the fairway. ""But is it certain that no one can overhear us?"""
once more asked the captain's wife.
"""You know that such is the case,"" said the two others."
"""Well, there is a counter-spell for what we wish to do, and if it is"
"used, it will go hard with us, for it will cost us nothing less than our"
"lives!"""
"wood-louse!  You nose out every evil thing.  Yes, the face of that"
young swindler shows that he has got what he wanted...  I wonder how
much Egorka has got out of them.  He has evidently taken something...
He is just the same sort of rogue that they are ... they are all tarred
"with the same brush.  He has got some money, and I'm damned if I did"
not arrange the whole thing for him!  It is best to own my folly...
"Yes, life is against us all, brothers ... and even when you spit upon"
"those nearest to you, the spittle rebounds and hits your own face."""
"Having satisfied himself with this reflection, the worthy Captain"
"looked round upon his staff.  Every one of them was disappointed,"
because they all knew that something they did not expect had taken
"place between Petunikoff and Vaviloff, and they all felt that they had"
been insulted.  The feeling that one is unable to injure anyone is
"worse than the feeling that one is unable to do good, because to do"
harm is far easier and simpler.
"""Well, why are we loitering here?  We have nothing more to wait for ..."
"except the reward that I shall get out--out of Egorka,..."" said the"
"Captain, looking angrily at the eating-house. ""So our peaceful life"
under the roof of Judas has come to an end. Judas will now turn us
"out....  So do not say that I have not warned you."""
Kanets smiled sadly.
"""What are you laughing at, jailer?"" Kuvalda asked."
"""Where shall I go then?"""
"""That, my soul, is a question that fate will settle for you, so do not"
"worry,"" said the Captain, thoughtfully, entering the dosshouse.  ""The"
"creatures that once were men"" followed him."
Now Aunt Achsa hesitated. One tear separated itself from its fellows
and rolled down her withered cheek and dropped upon her withered hand.
"She looked at it, startled, then lifted her hand and dashed it across"
her eyes.
"""I swum, I'm cryin'. Don't know as I know when I've cried before. And"
"cryin' before I have anything as I can see to cry for. But Sidney, I"
set such a lot on that boy--it's like I was his mother and his father
"and his brothers and his sisters all mixed up in one--gran'ma, too. He"
"was such a little mite when I took him, y'see and then he's not like"
other boys and I've had to do a heap of lovin' to make up to him. I've
prayed every day of my life for the Lord to keep him happy in spite of
things and that was a pretty big prayer for I don't suppose the Lord
"wants us all to be happy all the time, that ain't His way of bringing"
"us up. But I thought He might make an exception for Lav. Land sakes,"
"how I go on--and you nigh to cryin' yourself."" For she had caught"
Sidney blinking back something glistening from her own eyes.
"""Aunt Achsa, Lavender is wonderful. He's talked to me a lot and he's"
"going to be a great man some day, I know. He has the grandest plans"
"shut away in his heart and he _is_ happy--"""
"Aunt Achsa looked at her, startled. ""Plans--how _can_ he when he's--"""
She bit off the words. Her lips trembled.
"""Aunt Achsa, it doesn't matter what one's like on the outside!"" Now"
Sidney floundered for the second time in one day under the pressure of
"her own thoughts. ""I mean--Lav can do anything he wants to do, anyway."
"And he's working hard reading and studying and some day, after awhile,"
"he'll go away somewhere and study more--"""
cheek glared at the duke from under his upreared arm. So close were
they that blood spattered in the duke's face as the Frangipani blew
the red stream from his mouth and beard.
"[Illustration: ""'They lied,' he cried. 'Give me but life.'""]"
"The duke broke away, wheeled and came again. He lashed home, split the"
Frangipani's collar-bone even through the rags of his hauberk. The
"Frangipani yelped like a gored hound. Rabid, dazed, he began to make"
blind rushes that boded ill for him. The swords began to leap and to
"sing, while blinding flashes of lightning followed each other in quick"
succession and thunder rolled in deafening echoes through the heavens.
"Cut and counter-cut rang through the night, like the cry of axes,"
whirled by woodmen's hands.
Suddenly the Frangipani parried an upper cut and stabbed at the duke.
The sword point missed him a hair's breadth. Before he could guard the
"duke was upon him like a leopard. Both men smote together, both swords"
met with a sound that seemed to shake the rocks. The Frangipani's
blade snapped at the hilt.
"He stood still for a moment as one dazed, then plucked out his poniard"
"and made a spring. A merciless down cut beat him back. His courage,"
"his assurance seemed to ebb from him on a sudden, as though the blow"
"had broken his soul. He fell on his knees and held up his hands, with"
"a thick, choking cry."
"""Mercy! God's mercy!"""
"""Curse you! Had you pity on your victims?"""
Thunder crashed overhead; the girdles of the sky were loosed. A
"rowing. A little later I got up and looked again--oh, yes, they were"
getting on. I took up my post by the window. It was really quite
interesting to watch the boat getting smaller and smaller; finally I
"opened the window, even looked through my field-glasses. As it was not yet"
"quite light, I could not see them very clearly, but the red hat was still"
discernible. Then the boat disappeared behind an island. I dressed and
"went down. The children were all still in bed, but the wife, Regine, was"
up. How calmly and naturally she took everything!
"""Do you know where your husband is?"" I asked her."
"""Yes--funny, aren't they?"" she replied. ""I never saw them till after"
they'd left--gone down to the fjord. Where do you suppose they're going?
"Haddock fishing?"""
"""Maybe,"" was all I said. But I thought to myself: ""They're leaving, all"
"right. They had their knapsacks on their backs."""
"""Funny couple,"" Regine resumed. ""Nothing to eat, no coffee, not a thing!"
"And the missis not wanting anything to eat last night, neither!"""
I merely shook my head and went out. Regine called to me that coffee was
"nearly ready, so if I'd like a cup--"
Of course the only thing I could do in the face of such foolishness was to
shake my head and go away. One must take the sensible view. How was it
"possible to understand such behavior? Nevertheless I, the undersigned,"
"should have gone on to Olaus yesterday, instead of going fishing. That"
would have been still more sensible. What business had I at this house?
"Very likely she found it embarrassing to be called the ""missis,"" and this"
was why she could neither eat last night nor stay here today. So she had
"beaten a retreat, with her friend and her knapsack."
"""That boy--there!"" she gasped, ""he frightens me--oh hateful! make him go"
"away!"" And she clutched the young man's arm with such a quick nervous"
"grasp, that a crimson flush rose quickly to Rollo's cheek."
"""No,"" muttered Etienne to himself as he watched the performance"
"critically, ""she was never in love with you, sir! She never did as much"
"for you as that. But on the whole, with a temper like Mistress Concha's,"
"I think you are well out of it, Monsieur Etienne!"" Which wise dictum"
might or might not be based on the fox's opinion as to sour grapes.
All unconsciously Rollo reached a protecting hand across to the little
white fingers which gripped his arm so tightly.
"""Go away, boy,"" he commanded; ""do you not see that you terrify the"
"Señorita?"""
"""I see--that is why I stay!"" cried the amiable youth gleefully,"
flourishing his crutch about his head as if on the point of launching it
at the party.
Rollo laid his hand on the hilt of Killiecrankie with a threatening
gesture.
"""If you come an inch nearer, I will give you plague!"" cried the boy,"
"showing his teeth wickedly, ""and your wench also. You will grow"
"black--yes, and swell! Then you will die, both of you. And there will be"
"no one to bury you, like those in the houses back there. Then all you"
"possess shall be mine, ha, ha!"""
And he laughed and danced till a fit of coughing came upon him so that
he actually crowed in a kind of fiendish exaltation. But Rollo Blair was
"not a man to be jested with, either by devil or devil's imp. He drew a"
"""You cannot?  Why?""  I demanded, taken somewhat aback by her sudden"
attitude of determination.
"""I will not allow you to ruin yourself, Gerald, on my account,"" she"
declared in a very low but calm voice.
"""But why should my love for you prove my ruin?""  I cried madly.  ""The"
"truth is that you do not love me.  Why not admit it at once?"""
"""You are in error,"" she hastened to protest.  ""I do love you.  I love"
you to-day with the same fond affection as I entertained for you until
that day--fatal to me--when you turned your back upon me and left me.
"But, alas! we can never now be the same to one another as we were then."""
"She paused for a moment to regain breath; then, pale-faced, with eyes"
"filled with tears, she gripped my arm frantically, crying: ""Gerald, my"
"love, hear me!  These are my last words, but I pronounce them--I make"
confession--so that you may understand the barrier that now lies between
"us."""
"""Well,"" I said, ""speak--tell me!"""
"""Ah!"" she cried hoarsely, covering her face with her hands, ""you wring"
this confession from me.  I am the most unhappy girl in all the world.

"Gerald, I should deceive you, and leave you to discover the truth after"
our marriage.  But I cannot--I cannot!  Even though we shall part to-day

"single spark of honesty left within my heart!"""

"And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the"
swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there
"was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for"
"instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd"
"tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than"
"the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to"
"speak of, back in Undersea, but--yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as"
much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure
pump regulation.
How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me?

Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the
"accents, eloquently addressed to the fair Aileen. They writhed in their"
"chairs to gaze around and over the impending form of Tildy, that"
Aileen’s pulchritude might season and make ambrosia of their bacon and
eggs.
And Tildy was content to be the unwooed drudge if Aileen could receive
the flattery and the homage. The blunt nose was loyal to the short
Grecian. She was Aileen’s friend; and she was glad to see her rule
hearts and wean the attention of men from smoking pot-pie and lemon
meringue. But deep below our freckles and hay-coloured hair the
"unhandsomest of us dream of a prince or a princess, not vicarious, but"
coming to us alone.
There was a morning when Aileen tripped in to work with a slightly
bruised eye; and Tildy’s solicitude was almost enough to heal any
optic.
"“Fresh guy,” explained Aileen, “last night as I was going home at"
"Twenty-third and Sixth. Sashayed up, so he did, and made a break. I"
"turned him down, cold, and he made a sneak; but followed me down to"
"Eighteenth, and tried his hot air again. Gee! but I slapped him a good"
"one, side of the face. Then he give me that eye. Does it look real"
"awful, Til? I should hate that Mr. Nicholson should see it when he"
comes in for his tea and toast at ten.”
Tildy listened to the adventure with breathless admiration. No man had
ever tried to follow her. She was safe abroad at any hour of the
twenty-four. What bliss it must have been to have had a man follow one
and black one’s eye for love!
"Among the customers at Bogle’s was a young man named Seeders, who"
"worked in a laundry office. Mr. Seeders was thin and had light hair,"
"""That is simple,"" comments Captain Kuvalda.  ""It continues to serve."
"That is ridiculous.  To the merchant who is moving about in the city,"
it is profitable that it should continue to serve. Therefore it does
"continue."""
"""The article, in fact, is written on the subject,"" says the teacher."
"""Is it?  That is strange, it is more a subject for a feuilleton..."""
"""Such a subject must be treated with plenty of pepper...."""
"Then a short discussion begins.  The people listen attentively, as only"
one bottle of vodki has been drunk.
"After the leader, they read the local events, then the court"
"proceedings, and, if in the police court it reports that the defendant"
"or plaintiff is a merchant, then Aristid Kuvalda sincerely rejoices."
"If someone has robbed the merchant, ""That is good,"" says he.  ""Only it"
"is a pity they robbed him of so little.""  If his horses have broken"
"down, ""It is sad that he is still alive.""  If the merchant has lost his"
"suit in court, ""It is a pity that the costs were not double the amount."""
"""That would have been illegal,"" remarks the teacher"
"""Illegal!  But is the merchant himself legal?"" inquires Kuvalda,"
"bitterly.  ""What is the merchant?  Let us investigate this rough and"
"uncouth phenomenon.  First of all, every merchant is a mujik. He comes"
"from a village, and in course of time becomes a merchant.  In order to"
"be a merchant, one must have money.  Where can the mujik get the money"
"from?  It is well known that he does not get it by honest hard work,"
"and that means that the mujik, somehow or other, has been swindling."
"That is to say, a merchant is simply a dishonest mujik."""
"Yashka was ""touched with paint"" after two glasses of vodki, and was in"
a slightly uplifted condition.
"The people looked at him, expecting him to make a row, and all were"
silent.
"""Did you see me?  And how did it please you?"" asks Yashka."
The people control their laughter.
"""No; it did not please me,"" replies the teacher.  His tone is so"
serious that the people are silent.
"""You see I was just trying it,"" said Yashka, with bravado, fearing that"
"the teacher would rebuke him. ""The wife is satisfied....  She has not"
"got up yet to-day...."""
"The teacher, who was drawing absently with his fingers on the table,"
"said, ""Do you see, Yakov, why this did not please me? ... Let us go"
"into the matter thoroughly, and understand what you are really doing,"
and what the result may be.  Your wife is pregnant.  You struck her
last night on her sides and breast. That means that you beat not only
"her but the child too.  You may have killed him, and your wife might"
have died or else have become seriously ill.  To have the trouble of
"looking after a sick woman is not pleasant.  It is wearing, and would"
"cost you dear, because illness requires medicine, and medicine money."
"If you have not killed the child, you may have crippled him, and he"
"will be born deformed, lop-sided, or hunch-backed.  That means that he"
"will not be able to work, and it is only too important to you that he"
"should be a good workman.  Even if he be born ill, it will be bad"
"enough, because he will keep his mother from work, and will require"
medicine.  Do you see what you are doing to yourself?  Men who live by

"""It's no use, Dawson,"" protested I emphatically. ""You are a wonder at"
"disguise, and will look, I do not doubt, the very spit of a Marine."
But you can't pass among the men for half an hour without discovery.
"They are a class apart, they talk their own language, cherish their"
"own secret traditions, live in a world to which no stranger ever"
penetrates. You could pass as a naval officer more easily than you
"could as a Pongo. It is sheer madness, Dawson."""
"He gave a short laugh. ""Much you know about it. I have served in the"
"Red Corps myself. I was a recruit at Deal, passed two years at"
"Plymouth, and served afloat for three years. I was then drafted into"
the Naval Police. Afterwards I was recommended for detective work in
"the dockyards, and at the end of my Marine service joined the Yard. My"
"good man, I was a sergeant before I left the Corps."""
"""I give up, Dawson,"" said I. ""Nothing about you will ever surprise me"
"again. Not even if you claim to have been a Cabinet Minister."""
"A queer smile stole over his face. ""No, I have not been a minister,"
"but I have attended a meeting of the Cabinet."""
"Cary interposed at this point. ""Yours is a fine idea, Mr. Dawson. As a"
Marine sentry you can get yourself posted by the Major wherever you
"please, and the Guard will not talk even though they may wonder that"
any man should want to do twenty-four hours of duty per day. The
"Marines are the closest, faith-fullest, and best disciplined force in"
the wide world. Bluejackets will gossip; Marines never. You will be
"able to watch more closely than even Trehayne, who, I suppose, will"
"also be on board."""
"smooth, the delicate tracery of veins could be distinctly seen, and each"
"muscle stood out hard and taut; there was no superfluous flesh, but a"
firmness and excellence of condition that brought a smile of
"satisfaction to Grey’s face.  He turned with a smile to Dick, who stood"
by beaming.
"""Not much fear of him to-day, eh, Dicon?"""
"""He would jump the moon, master, if you asked it of him,"" was the proud"
and confident answer.
"""How do the others look?  Have you seen them?"""
"""Pretty bits of horseflesh every one; and there is a black stallion of"
Mr. Artheret’s that will take some beating.  But he’s too heavy for some
of the jumps. He don’t take off fast enough.  And he’s a nasty temper
"too.  There’s a gray Arab with pace; but he falls away behind, as they"
all do.  I don’t think Don Carlos will be troubled long by him.  None of
"the others will take much beating.  Pretty to look at, but not trained"
"for what they’ve got to do.  Lord Sandford was here yesterday early,"
"looking at the jumps, and he had several of them made stiffer; but"
"there’s nothing Don Carlos cannot sail over like a bird!"""
"""Let us go and see,"" said Grey.  ""I will take a canter on the turf to"
"warm myself to the saddle. Soh, boy, soh!"" as he lightly vaulted to his"
"seat, and the horse curveted beneath him.  ""We will take a look at these"
"obstructions.  The stiffer they are, the better you and I will be"
"pleased—eh, my beauty?"""
"Dick mounted his nag, and rode beside his master to the course, where"
the horses were to be matched against each other when Lord Sandford and
"his friends should have finished their merry meal, and be ready to"
"changing slowly."""
"""Nay, the Queen herself will never change!"" cried Wylde, with an"
"emphatic gesture.  ""The Duchess has changed, and she seeks to use her"
"influence with the Queen to make her change also, and give up her Tory"
advisers altogether.  But she will not succeed.  The Queen may be timid
"and gentle, but she has all her father’s tenacity and obstinacy.  Let my"
Lady of Marlborough look to it!  She may strain the cord to breaking
"point.  Already they say that the new favourite, Mrs. Masham, is ousting"
"her kinswoman, the Duchess, from the foremost place in the Queen’s"
affections.  Favourites have fallen ere this through too great
"arrogance.  The victories of Ramillies and Oudenarde, and the successes"
"that have followed, make the Duke the idol of the nation and the"
"favourite of the Queen yet; but the day may come when this may change,"
"and then the high Tories may come in once more with a rush."""
"""I should be sorry for the Duke to lose favour,"" spoke Grey"
"thoughtfully.  ""I did see him once, and had speech with him after the"
"battle of Ramillies, and a more gracious and courtly gentleman it has"
"never been my lot to meet."""
Suddenly the Old Lion’s eyes flashed fire.
"""You have seen and had speech with the Duke on the field of Ramillies?"
"You saw the battle, or something of it?  Speak!  Tell me all!  I must"
"hear this tale.  It may mean much to us both."""
"""In sooth it is little I can tell you of the battle, for I was in the"
thick of it myself.  It was by accident that my servant and I came upon
the rival armies; and another happy accident gave me the chance of doing
"a small service for the Duke.  After the battle, when we were hard by"
"Louvain, he called me to him, and spoke many gracious words. I would"
"plate. She fears--"""
"_Von G._: ""I understand! We have a dr-r-eadful reputation, we poor"
Germans! The French stuff you up with lies. But we are better than
you think. You shall take them in two--three days to Brussels when
"things are quiet, and put them in some bank. Here I fear I must"
stay. I must intrude myself on your hospitality. But better for you
perhaps if I stay here at present. I will put a few of my men in
your--your--buildings. Most of them shall go with their officers to
"Tervueren for billet."" (Turning to Mrs. Warren.) ""Madam, you must"
cheer up. I foresee your daughter and I will be great friends. Let
us now look through the rooms and see what disposition we can make.
"I think I will have to take this room for my writing, for my work. I"
"see you have telephone here. _Gut_!"""
"Leaving Mrs. Warren still seated, but a little less stertorous in"
"breathing, a little reassured, Vivie and Oberst von Giesselin then"
"went over the Villa, apportioning the rooms. The Colonel and his"
orderly would be lodged in two of the bedrooms. Vivie and her mother
would share Mrs. Warren's large bedroom and retain the salon for
their exclusive occupation. They would use the dining-room in common
with their guest.
"Vivie looking out of the windows occasionally, as they passed from"
"room to room, saw the remainder of the soldiery strolling off to be"
"lodged at their nearest neighbour's, the farmer who had driven them"
"in to Brussels that morning. There were perhaps thirty, accompanying"
"a young lieutenant. How would he find room for them, poor man? They"
were more fortunate in being asked only to lodge six or seven in
"addition to the Colonel's orderly and soldier-clerk. Before sunset,"
"the Villa Beau-séjour was clear of soldiers, except the few that had"
gone to the barn and the outhouses. The morning room had been fitted
"""We have one last chance here to deal with this problem. Tomorrow the"
"_oyabun's_ people arrive, and then they will be in control. The"
decisions will no longer be ours. Tonight I attempted to salvage the
"situation and failed. Surely you know what that means, for us both. But"
"if you will give me Vance, perhaps we can both still be saved. If you"
"refuse to cooperate, the _oyabun _will destroy you as well as Vance. We"
"both know that. I am offering you a way out."""
"""With deepest gratitude, I must tell you it is too late, Sato-sama,"
"which I am sure you realize,"" Nogami said, drawing on his cigar and"
"taking care not to disturb the ash. ""So with due respect I must inquire"
"concerning the purpose of this meeting."""
"""I need to locate this man Vance. Before the _kobun _from Tokyo arrive."
"If you care about his well-being, then you should remember that his"
"treatment at my hands will be more understanding than--"""
"""When do they arrive?"""
"""As I said, we received word that they will be here tomorrow, Nogami-"
"san. With respect, you have befriended a man who is attempting to"
"blackmail the Tokyo _oyabun_. That is a career decision which, I assure"
"you, is most unwise."""
"""It is made. And I am aware of the consequences. So it would appear we"
"both know all there is to know about the future."""
"""Perhaps not entirely. Someone has attempted to make us think Vance and"
"the woman were kidnapped, that they are being held somewhere beyond our"
"reach. Perhaps it is true, perhaps it is not. But if the transaction"
"for the hundred million is to take place tomorrow, then he must appear"
of the people settled down to a lively _conversazione_. It is much
"nicest, on the whole, to travel third class on the railway. There is"
"space, there is air, and it is like being in a lively inn, everybody in"
good spirits.
At our end was plenty of room. Just across the gangway was an elderly
"couple, like two children, coming home very happily. He was fat, fat all"
"over, with a white moustache and a little not-unamiable frown. She was a"
"tall lean, brown woman, in a brown full-skirted dress and black apron,"
"with huge pocket. She wore no head covering, and her iron grey hair was"
parted smoothly. They were rather pleased and excited being in the
"train. She took all her money out of her big pocket, and counted it and"
"gave it to him: all the ten Lira notes, and the five Lira and the two"
"and the one, peering at the dirty scraps of pink-backed one-lira notes"
to see if they were good. Then she gave him her half-pennies. And he
"stowed them away in the trouser pocket, standing up to push them down"
"his fat leg. And then one saw, to one's amazement, that the whole of his"
"shirt-tail was left out behind, like a sort of apron worn backwards."
"Why--a mystery. He was one of those fat, good-natured, unheeding men"
"with a little masterful frown, such as usually have tall, lean,"
"hard-faced, obedient wives."
They were very happy. With amazement he watched us taking hot tea from
the Thermos flask. I think he too had suspected it might be a bomb. He
had blue eyes and standing-up white eyebrows.
"""Beautiful hot--!"" he said, seeing the tea steam. It is the inevitable"
"exclamation. ""Does it do you good?"""
"""Yes,"" said the q-b. ""Much good."" And they both nodded complacently."
They were going home.
THE HAT OF THE _HULDRES_
"Once upon a time there was a big wedding at a certain farmstead, and a"
certain cottager was on his way to the wedding-feast. As he chanced to
"cross a field, he found a milk-strainer, such as are usually made of"
"cows' tails, and looking just like an old brown rag. He picked it up,"
"for he thought it could be washed, and then he would give it to his"
wife for a dish-rag. But when he came to the house where they were
"celebrating the wedding, it seemed as though no one saw him. The bride"
"and groom nodded to the rest of the guests, they spoke to them and"
poured for them; but he got neither greeting nor drink. Then the chief
cook came and asked the other folk to sit down to the table; but he was
"not asked, nor did he get anything to eat. For he did not care to sit"
down of his own accord when no one had asked him. At last he grew angry
"and thought: ""I might as well go home, for not a soul pays a bit of"
"attention to me here."" When he reached home, he said: ""Good evening,"
"here I am back again."""
"""For heaven's sake, are you back again?"" asked his wife."
"""Yes, there was no one there who paid any attention to me, or even so"
"much as looked at me,"" said the man, ""and when people show me so little"
"consideration, it seems as though I have nothing to look for there."""
"""But where are you? I can hear you, but I cannot see you!"" cried his"
wife.
"The man was invisible, for what he had found was a _huldre_ hat."
"""What are you talking about? Can't you see me? Have you lost your wits?"""
"The sun is already setting. Far up the mountainside are the cattle, but"
they are moving homeward now; I can hear by their bells that they are
"moving. Tinkling bells and deep-mouthed bells, sometimes sounding together"
"as though there were a meaning in it, a pattern of tones, a rapture."
"And rapture, too, to see all the blades of grass and the tiny flowers and"
"plants. Beside me where I lie is a small pod plant, wonderfully meek, with"
"tiny seeds pushing out of the pod--God bless it, it's becoming a mother!"
It has got caught in a dry twig and I liberate it. Life quivers within it;
"the sun has warmed it today and called it to its destiny. A tiny, gigantic"
miracle.
"Now it is sunset, and the woods bend under a rustling that passes"
through them sweet and heavy; it is the evening.
"I lie for another hour or two; the birds have long since gone to rest, and"
"darkness falls thick and soft.... As I walk homeward, my feet feel their"
"way and I hold my hands before me till I reach the field, where it is a"
little lighter. I walk on the hay that has been left outdoors; it is tough
"and black, and I slip on it because it is already rotting. As I approach"
"the houses, bats fly noiselessly past me, as though on wings of foam. A"
slight shudder convulses me whenever they pass.
Suddenly I stop.
A man is walking here. I can see him against the wall of the new house. He
"has on a coat that looks like the actor's raincoat, but it is not the"
"little comedian himself. There he goes, into the house, right into the"
house. It is Solem.
"""Why, that's where she sleeps!"" I think. ""Ah, well. Alone in the building,"
"in the south wing, Miss Torsen alone--yes, quite alone. And Solem has just"
"""Nehal--turn back! Turn back!"""
He did not understand her. He thought she was still pleading with him.
"""I can not--God have pity on us both!"""
Then she too set her lips. She could not betray the last hope of that
heroic handful of men and women behind her. He must go to his
"death--and she to hers. She fired,--whether with success or not, she"
never knew. In that same instant another sound broke upon their
"ears--the sound of distant firing, the rattle of drums and the high"
clear call of a trumpet. Nehal Singh swung around. She caught a
"glimpse of his face through the smoke, and she saw something written"
there which she could not understand. She only knew that his features
"seemed to bear a new familiarity, as though a mask had been torn from"
"them, revealing the face of another man, of a man whom she had seen"
"before, when and where she could not tell. She had no time to analyze"
her emotions nor the sense of violent shock which passed over her. She
"heard Nehal Singh giving sharp, rapid orders in Hindustani. The room"
emptied. She saw him follow the retreating natives. At the door he
turned and looked back at her. At no time had his love for her
revealed itself more clearly than in that last glance.
"""The English regiment has come to help you,"" he said. ""Fate has"
"intervened between us this time. May we never meet again!"""
"He passed out through the shattered doorway, but she stood where he"
"had left her, motionless, almost unconscious. It was thus Nicholson"
"and the Colonel found her when, a moment later, they entered the room"
by the verandah. Colonel Carmichael's passionate reproaches died away
as he saw her face.
I answered in a low tone that I thought she must.
'No!' my lady cried harshly--she could be cruel sometimes--'not with
"us. She does not belong to our party. Let her stay with her paymaster,"
and to-morrow he will doubtless reward her.'
What reward she was likely to get Fraulein Max knew well. She flung
"herself at my lady's feet in an agony of fear, and clutching her"
"skirts, cried abjectly for mercy; she would carry, she would help, she"
"would do anything, if she might go! Knowing that we dared not leave"
her since she would be certain to release the general as soon as our
"backs were turned, I was glad when Marie, whose heart was touched,"
joined her prayers to the culprit's and won a reluctant consent.
It has taken long to tell these things. They passed very quickly. I
suppose not more than a quarter of an hour elapsed between our first
"appearance and this juncture, which saw us all standing in the"
"lamplight, laden and ready to be gone; while the general glowered at"
"us in sullen rage, and my lady, with a new thought in her mind, looked"
round in dismay.
"She drew me aside. 'Martin,' she said, 'his orderly is waiting in the"
road with his horse. The moment we are gone he will shout to him.'
"'We have provided for that,' I answered, nodding. Then assuring myself"
"by a last look round that all were ready, I gave the word. 'Now,"
Steve!' I said sharply.
In a twinkling he flung over the general's head a small sack doubled
inwards. We heard a stifled oath and a cry of rage. The bars of the
"strong chair creaked as our prisoner struggled, and for a moment it"
feel their knuckles against her.  Had he gone mad?  Would he strangle
"her?  But her eyes never moved from his, and his began to waver; his"
"hands dropped, and, with a kind of moan, he made for the door."
Monsieur Harmost's voice behind her said:
"""Before you go, monsieur, give me some explanation of this imbecility!"""
"Fiorsen spun round, shook his fist, and went out muttering.  They heard"
"the front door slam.  Gyp turned abruptly to the window, and there, in"
"her agitation, she noticed little outside things as one does in moments"
"of bewildered anger.  Even into that back yard, summer had crept.  The"
leaves of the sumach-tree were glistening; in a three-cornered little
"patch of sunlight, a black cat with a blue ribbon round its neck was"
basking.  The voice of one hawking strawberries drifted melancholy from a
side street.  She was conscious that Monsieur Harmost was standing very
"still, with a hand pressed to his mouth, and she felt a perfect passion"
of compunction and anger.  That kind and harmless old man--to be so
insulted!  This was indeed the culmination of all Gustav's outrages!  She
"would never forgive him this!  For he had insulted her as well, beyond"
"what pride or meekness could put up with.  She turned, and, running up to"
"the old man, put both her hands into his."
"""I'm so awfully sorry.  Good-bye, dear, dear Monsieur Harmost; I shall"
"come on Friday!""  And, before he could stop her, she was gone."
"She dived into the traffic; but, just as she reached the pavement on the"
"other side, felt her dress plucked and saw Fiorsen just behind her.  She"
shook herself free and walked swiftly on.  Was he going to make a scene
"in the street?  Again he caught her arm.  She stopped dead, faced round"
"on him, and said, in an icy voice:"
"There was a train back to Cagliari that night, said the conductor, at"
which the fat man nearly burst out of his clothing like a bursting
seed-pod. He bounced on his seat. What good was that? What good was a
"train back to Cagliari, when their home was in Snelli! Making matters"
worse--
"So they bounced and jerked and argued at one another, to their hearts'"
"content. Then the conductor retired, smiling subtly, in a way they have."
"Our fat friend looked at us with hot, angry, ashamed, grieved eyes and"
"said it was a shame. Yes, we chimed, it _was_ a shame. Whereupon a"
self-important miss who said she came from some Collegio at Cagliari
advanced and asked a number of impertinent questions in a tone of pert
"sympathy. After which our fat friend, left alone, covered his clouded"
"face with his hand, turned his back on the world, and gloomed."
"It had all been so dramatic that in spite of ourselves we laughed, even"
while the q-b shed a few tears.
*       *       *       *       *
"Well, the journey lasted hours. We came to a station, and the conductor"
said we must get out: these coaches went no further. Only two coaches
"would proceed to Mandas. So we climbed out with our traps, and our fat"
"friend with his saddle-bag, the picture of misery."
The one coach into which we clambered was rather crowded. The only other
coach was most of it first-class. And the rest of the train was freight.
We were two insignificant passenger wagons at the end of a long string
of freight-vans and trucks.
"There was an empty seat, so we sat on it: only to realize after about"
"five minutes, that a thin old woman with two children--her"
sleep. Good-night.”
"“Good-night,” she said miserably."
"And so, without touch of hand, they parted."
"The hours of the evening wore on, and night came. At last she cried"
herself to sleep. It had been a day of tears.
They left Ostend quietly the following morning by the Dover boat. During
the whole journey the Canon treated Yvonne with the deferential courtesy
"he could always assume to women, seeing to her comforts, anticipating"
"her wants, even exchanging now and then casual remarks on passing"
objects of interest. But of the subject next his heart he said not a
word. The crossing was smooth. The sea air revived Yvonne’s strength.
"His silence half comforted, half frightened her. Had he relented? She"
"glanced often at his impassive face, in cruel anxiety to pierce to the"
thoughts that lay behind. Yet a little hope came to her; for fear of
losing it she dared not speak. To her simple mind it seemed impossible
that merely conscientious scruples could make him cast her off. If he
"loved her, his love would triumph. If he persisted in his resolve, he"
cared for her no longer. In this case her future was very simple. She
would go back to London and sing.
She seemed to have cried her feeling away during the night--such as he
had left unbruised and untorn. For the quivering flesh is only sensitive
up to a certain point of maceration. He had trodden upon her pitilessly;
"but she felt no resentment. In fact, she would have been quite happy if"
"he had put his arms round her and said, “Let us forget, Yvonne.” By the"
end of the journey she had cajoled herself into the idea that he would
do so.
"faculty for absorbing butter. The stomachs of most men, really good at"
"their business, would have revolted at the diet which his superiors"
"shovelled into Dawson, but he visibly expanded and blossomed. Yes,"
"Scotland Yard knew its Dawson, and exactly how to stimulate the best"
that was in him. He never bored me; I enjoyed him too thoroughly.
One day in my club I chanced upon the Admiral.
"""Have you met our friend Dawson lately?"" I asked."
"""Met him?"" shouted he, with a roar of laughter. ""Met him? He is in my"
office every day--he almost lives with me; goodness knows when he does
his work. He has a pocket full of letters which he has read to me till
I know them by heart. If I did not know that he was a first-class man
"I should set him down as a colossal ass. Yet, I rather wish that the"
Admiralty would sometimes write to me as the severe but very human
"Scotland Yard does to Dawson."""
"""Does he ever come to you in disguise?"" I asked."
"""Not that I know of. I see vast numbers of people; some of them may be"
"Dawson in his various incarnations, but he has not given himself"
"away."""
"Then I explained to my naval friend my own experience. ""He tried,"" I"
"said, ""to play the disguise game on me, and clean bowled me the first"
time. While he was laughing over my discomfiture I studied his face
more closely than a lover does that of his mistress. I tried to
penetrate his methods. He never wears a wig or false hair; he is too
wise for that folly. Yet he seems able to change his hair from light
"to dark, to make it lank or curly, short or long. He does it; how I"
"don't know. He alters the shape of his nose, his cheeks, and his chin."
"And then, in great mental agony, I said to myself: ""I _will_ be happy, I"
"_will_ enjoy my leave."" But a number of invisible cobwebs hung between"
"myself and the world around me. I tried to brush them away, but they"
were so impalpable that the movement of my hand did not disturb them at
all.
I gave up the attempt. I would wait until I got home. Then I would talk
and forget myself--only by forgetting myself would I enjoy the present.
Only those who forget themselves are happy. The obsession of self is
the most oppressive of all burdens.
I descended from a 'bus and took a train. A girl sitting opposite me
"stared at my blue chevrons and whispered to her fellow passenger: ""He's"
"just come from the front."" So I too was regarded as a strange kind of"
animal. I got out at my home-station. I showed my leave-warrant to the
ticket collector. He was a benevolent looking old man. He smiled and
wished me good luck. Things began to seem a little less foreign. And
then the thought of being home in a few minutes absorbed me entirely.
"I hurried down the street. I knocked at the door, and it opened. The"
long yearned-for meeting took place at last.
"I threw my pack, equipment and steel helmet contemptuously into a"
"corner. I took an infantile delight in clean, furnished rooms, in the"
"white table-cloth, the shining silver, the cut flowers, and the"
oil-paintings on the wall. And we talked until late into the night.
It was good to wake up the next morning and to know that the first day
of my leave was still before me. I felt encouraged to face my new
surroundings boldly. I would understand them and identify myself with
"them. If the sensation that I was dreaming came upon me again, I would"
"""Don't waste your breath on them,"" Boyd advised. ""We're lucky enough as"
"it is. If that tug hadn't sheered off she would have cut us down, sure."""
"""That fellow done it a-purpose,"" George swore. ""Seamen ain't that"
"careless. He tried to tell me he was rattled, but I rattled _him_."""
"""If that's the case they may try it again,"" said the younger man."
"""Huh! I'll pack a 'thirty-thirty' from now on, and I bet they don't get"
"within hailing distance without an iron-clad."""
"The more calmly Emerson regarded the incident, the more he marvelled at"
"the good-fortune that had saved him. ""We had better wake up,"" he said."
"""We have been asleep so far. If Marsh planned this, he will plan"
"something more."""
"""Yes, and if he puts one wallop over we're done for,"" George agreed,"
"pessimistically. ""I'll keep a watchman aboard the scows hereafter."
"That's our vital spot."""
"But the days sped past without further interference, and the"
"construction of the plant progressed by leaps and bounds, while _The"
"Bedford Castle_, having discharged her cargo, steamed away to return in"
August.
"The middle of June brought the first king salmon, scouts sent on ahead"
"of the ""sockeyes;"" but Boyd made no effort to take advantage of this"
"run, laboring manfully to prepare for the advance of the main army,"
"that terrific horde that was soon to come from the mysterious depths,"
"either to make or ruin him. Once the run proper started, there would be"
no more opportunity for building or for setting up machinery. He must
be ready and waiting by the first of July.

"road agent--an outlaw by profession. Yes, I'm all that--and my father"
"was that before me. I was brought up, educated, thrived on thieves'"
"money, I suppose, but until six months ago when my father died, I did"
not know it. I lived much in Monterey--I lived there as a gentleman.
When we met that day I wasn't the thing I am to-day. I only learned the
truth when my father died and left me with a rancho and a band of
"thieves--nothing else--nothing for us all, and I--but what's the good of"
going into it--the circumstances. You wouldn't understand if I did. I
"was my father's son; I have no excuse; I guess, perhaps, it was in"
"me--in the blood. Anyhow, I took to the road, and I didn't mind it much"
after the first time. But I drew the line at killing--I wouldn't have

"raised his eyes and said with a voice that was charged with feeling--""I"
swear to you that from the moment I kissed you to-night I meant to
"change, I meant to--"""
"""The devil you did!"" broke from the Girl's lips, but with a sound that"
was not unlike a sob.
"""I did, believe me, I did,"" insisted the man. ""I meant to go straight"
and take you with me--but only honestly--when I could honestly. I meant
"to work for you. Why, every word you said to me to-night about being a"
thief cut into me like a knife. Over and over again I have said to
"myself, she must never know. And now--well, it's all over--I have"
"finished."""
"""An' that's all?"" questioned the Girl with averted face."
"""No--yes--what's the use . . .?"""
The Girl's anger blazed forth again.
knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open
it with. Not even a button you could press.
That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps
back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock
"combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice"
"key--might as well see if that's it, I figured."
"""Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame."""
"For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million"
"possible combinations--The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and"
a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed
around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.
I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and
"sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found"
myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the
cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen.
He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that
looked hard and soft at the same time.
"His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his"
back.
"And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the"
"deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards"
in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation--the kind of tan
that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His
"hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long"
combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down
plaid bicycle cap perched on the back of his head. The lady looked at
"him coolly, without prejudice or favour."
"“Lady,” he said, “dat gent on de oder bench sent yer a song and dance"
"by me. If yer don’t know de guy, and he’s tryin’ to do de Johnny act,"
"say de word, and I’ll call a cop in t’ree minutes. If yer does know"
"him, and he’s on de square, w’y I’ll spiel yer de bunch of hot air he"
sent yer.”
The young lady betrayed a faint interest.
"“A song and dance!” she said, in a deliberate sweet voice that seemed"
to clothe her words in a diaphanous garment of impalpable irony. “A new
"idea—in the troubadour line, I suppose. I—used to know the gentleman"
"who sent you, so I think it will hardly be necessary to call the"
"police. You may execute your song and dance, but do not sing too"
"loudly. It is a little early yet for open-air vaudeville, and we might"
attract attention.”
"“Awe,” said the boy, with a shrug down the length of him, “yer know"
"what I mean, lady. ’Tain’t a turn, it’s wind. He told me to tell yer"
he’s got his collars and cuffs in dat grip for a scoot clean out to
’Frisco. Den he’s goin’ to shoot snow-birds in de Klondike. He says yer
told him not to send ’round no more pink notes nor come hangin’ over de
"garden gate, and he takes dis means of puttin’ yer wise. He says yer"
"refereed him out like a has-been, and never give him no chance to kick"
"at de decision. He says yer swiped him, and never said why.”"
The slightly awakened interest in the young lady’s eyes did not abate.
Perhaps it was caused by either the originality or the audacity of the
"snow-bird hunter, in thus circumventing her express commands against"
the ordinary modes of communication. She fixed her eye on a statue
gone long barefoot. The marks of a child either stolen for ransom or run
away from home owing to some wild strain in the blood were too obvious
to be mistaken. Her liberty of movement among the gipsies made the
latter supposition the more probable.
"""I am _not_ pretty Chica, and I am not little,"" she cried angrily. ""I"
"would have you remember, Pépe, that _I_ made this plan, which the folk"
of Egypt are to execute to-night. But since this is the great brigand
"Don José of Ronda, who was executed at Salamanca, I will tell him all"
"about it."""
She looked round at the dark faces with which they were surrounded.
"""There are new folk among these,"" she said, ""men I do not know. Bid them"
"go away. Else I will not speak of myself, and I have much to say to Don"
"José!"""
"Pépe of the Eleven Wounds looked about him, and shook his head. Gipsydom"
"is a commonwealth when it comes to a venture like this, and save in the"
"presence of some undoubted leader, all Egypt has an equal right to hear"
and to speak. Pépe's authority was not sufficient for this thing. But
that of the Sergeant was.
"He lifted his Montera cap and said, ""I would converse a while with this"
maid on the affairs of Egypt. 'Tis doubtless no more than you know
"already, and then, having heard her story my advice is at your service."
"But she will not speak with so many ears about. It is a woman's whim,"
"and such the wisest of us must sometimes humour."""
The gipsies smiled at the gay wave of his hand with which Cardono
uttered this truism and quickly betook themselves out of earshot in
"groups of ten and a dozen. Cards were produced, and in a few minutes"
"blowed ter bits. Oh, it's 'ard when yer've bin together all the time an'"
"shared everythink."""
He buried his face in his hands and made no further sound except an
occasional sniff and a hasty drawing in of the breath through trembling
lips.
"""It's bloody murder up the line,"" said a full Corporal. ""We were in a"
trench four feet deep and up to our waist in water. A Jerry sniper
"spotted us and one man got biffed, [killed] and then the next, and then the"
next all along the trench. We were packed together like sardines and had
no cover at all for our heads and shoulders. I got the wind up terribly
'cause I knew my turn was coming. He only gave me a Blighty though--I
"reckon I'm bloody lucky!"""
"""We was ready for to go over the top an' waitin' for the whistle to"
blow. We didn't 'alf 'ave the wind up. You could 'ear the teeth
"chatterin' all along the trench. I was shiverin' all over, I...."""
"""Next man!"" The conversation stopped while the next man went across, but"
"having once begun to tell their experiences, the men would not stop"
"altogether, and after a brief silence an elderly little man with a"
bandaged foot said:
"""What I couldn't get over was insomnia. I could never sleep at the"
right time and I was always dead tired on duty. Once I worked
forty-three hours at a stretch and after that I had to do a guard in our
trench. I felt sleepy all of a sudden. I pinched myself and banged the
"butt of my rifle on my toes, but everything seemed to swim round me."
"Then, I don't know how, I went off to sleep. I was awakened by an"
officer who shook me and swore at me. I was a bit dazed at first and
then suddenly it struck me what had happened. I never had the wind up so
and I can’t for the life of me see an earthly way of scraping the
money together. Last of all--and worst of all--I haven’t been able to
make a single sale of lumber for the simple reason that the trust has
cut prices below cost and has taken every customer from us. If I cut
to meet them they go lower. You can see that. They’ve got the stock
"and the resources. Crane’s set out to ruin us at any cost, and he’s"
"succeeded. It hurts like sin to say it, boy, but there’s nothing left"
to do but give in and make the best terms we can. Let me hear from you
"at once. Yours ever, John Tweedy."
CHAPTER XI. NO QUITTER
"The letter dropped into Bob’s lap, and for a long minute he sat staring"
"into the yellow, dancing flames. His face was blank, and just a little"
"white, for the blow had been a heavy one, and totally unexpected. He"
"could not seem to understand it. It was unbelievable that he and Tweedy,"
"who had been fair and square in every one of their business dealings,"
could be forced to the wall by such a monster of corruption as Elihu
Crane.
There must be some mistake. Tweedy must have been thrown into one of his
"unjustifiable panics. That was it, of course."
Bob picked up the letter to read it carefully again.
"He perused it to the last word, and then leaned back against the"
"sapling, his face drawn and somber. It really did not sound like a"
"mistake. It was all clear and logical, and singularly cohesive. It was"
the sort of thing Crane would delight in planning and putting into
execution--the cutting of prices on a competitor. Tweedy had written
"that if they attempted to cut under the trust’s present rates, there"
"some sand-bags, trembling all over and feeling as though I was going to"
"choke. I waited for a long time, but nothing happened, so I got up and"
looked round. Lucky escape for us! There's a terrific hole by the Red
Cross and another one behind the bath-house. The third's in the next
field. Only two men hit. O'Neil's got it in the elbow--he's all right
for Blighty. Poor old Hartog's badly hurt--a frightful gash in the thigh
with the piece still in it. I hope he won't have to lose his leg.
"Christ, I'm glad it's all over--I wouldn't like to go through that"
"again."""
"There was silence for a while, but soon the silence was broken by the"
distant muttering of anti-aircraft fire.
"""Jesus Christ Almighty--'e's comin' again--O God, why can't 'e leave us"
"alone."""
We stood outside the marquee and anxiously watched the horizon. We heard
"a faint humming noise. It grew louder and louder until it became a deep,"
droning buzz that rose and fell in regular pulsation. Then
boom--boom--boom--three times the sullen roar of distant explosions
"sounded. Then there came the familiar rushing, whistling noise of a"
descending bomb. We flung ourselves down in the wet grass. I felt every
muscle in my body contract as though I were trying to make myself as
small as a pin point in expectation of the terrible moment. There was a
dull thud close by and I felt the earth vibrate. The bomb had fallen a
"few yards away, but had merely buried itself in the earth without"
exploding.
"There was no anti-aircraft fire, but the droning noise continued loudly,"
"rising and falling. Private Trotter, who was lying beside me, was"
drawing his breath in sharply between his lips. Our fear of impending
disaster was prolonged intolerably. The droning propeller seemed to be
"_Antigone_ for damage to her forefoot. Engineers were on one job, and"
platers and riveters on the other. Different trades. So not a workman
who was in the _Antinous_ was also in the _Antigone_. We can rule out
all the workmen. We can also rule out my lieutenant R.N.R. with the
German name who has gone to sea in the _Antinous_. The care and
maintenance party in the _Antigone_ was not the same as the one in the
"_Antinous_, not a man the same."""
"""You are sure of that?"" cried I, for it seemed that my daring theory"
"had gone to wreck. ""You are quite sure."""
"""Quite. I have all the names and have examined all the men. They were"
all off the ship by eleven o'clock last night. I hadn't one of my own
"men among them, but, to make sure, I sent Petty Officer Trehayne on"
board at eight o'clock to keep a sharp look-out and to see all the
harbour party off the vessel. He reported a little after eleven that
they were all gone and the ship taken over by her own crew. The damage
"was discovered at four bells in the morning watch."""
"""Six o'clock a.m.,"" interpreted Cary."
"""It looks now as if there might be a traitor among her own crew, which"
"is her officers' job, not mine. I wash my hands of the _Antigone_, but"
it is very much up to me to see that nothing hurtful happens to the
_Malplaquet_. The Admiral has orders to support me with all the force
under his command; the General of the District has the same orders.
But it isn't force we want so much as brains--Dawson's brains. I have
"been beaten twice, but not the third time. I've told the Yard that if"
"the _Malplaquet_ is touched I shall resign, and if they send any one"
"to help me I shall resign. Between to-day, Thursday, and Saturday I am"
going to catch the wily josser who has a fancy for cutting gun cables
"or Dawson will say good-bye to the Force. That's a fair stake."""
"'Can you do anything,' I asked, 'to cheer him? Do you speak to him of"
"what may happen after death, of hopes of another life?'"
"'No one can tell,' said my friend, 'what will happen after death. It"
"depends on a man's life, if he has done good or evil, what his next"
"existence will be, whether he will go a step nearer to the Peace. When"
"the man is dying no monks will come, truly; but an old man, an old"
"friend, father, perhaps, or an elder of the village, and he will talk to"
"the dying man. He will say, ""Think of your good deeds; think of all that"
"you have done well in this life. Think of your good deeds.""'"
'What is the use of that?' I asked. 'Suppose you think of your good
"deeds, what then? Will that bring peace?'"
The Burman seemed to think that it would.
"'Nothing,' he said, 'was so calming to a man's soul as to think of even"
one deed he had done well in his life.'
"Think of the man dying. The little house built of bamboo and thatch,"
"with an outer veranda, where the friends are sitting, and the inner"
"room, behind a wall of bamboo matting, where the man is lying. A pot of"
"flowers is standing on a shelf on one side, and a few cloths are hung"
here and there beneath the brown rafters. The sun comes in through
"little chinks in roof and wall, making curious lights in the"
"semi-darkness of the room, and it is very hot."
"From outside come the noises of the village, cries of children playing,"
"grunts of cattle, voices of men and women clearly heard through the"
still clear air of the afternoon. There is a woman pounding rice near
"by with a steady thud, thud of the lever, and there is a clink of a loom"
from a German mercantile sub-marine. So he says. Fifty francs a
"metre--very, very wide. But they are too much trouble to carry in a"
"knapsack, though their brilliance fascinates."
*       *       *       *       *
"So we stroll and look at the shops, at the filigree gold jewelling of"
"the peasants, at a good bookshop. But there is little to see and"
"therefore the question is, shall we go on? Shall we go forward?"
There are two ways of leaving Cagliari for the north: the State railway
"that runs up the west side of the island, and the narrow-gauge secondary"
railway that pierces the centre. But we are too late for the big trains.
"So we will go by the secondary railway, wherever it goes."
"There is a train at 2.30, and we can get as far as Mandas, some fifty"
miles in the interior. When we tell the queer little waiter at the
"hotel, he says he comes from Mandas, and there are two inns. So after"
lunch--a strictly fish menu--we pay our bill. It comes to sixty odd
"francs--for three good meals each, with wine, and the night's lodging,"
"this is cheap, as prices now are in Italy."
"Pleased with the simple and friendly Scala di Ferre, I shoulder my sack"
and we walk off to the second station. The sun is shining hot this
"afternoon--burning hot, by the sea. The road and the buildings look dry"
"and desiccated, the harbour rather weary and end of the world."
There is a great crowd of peasants at the little station. And almost
every man has a pair of woven saddle-bags--a great flat strip of
"coarse-woven wool, with flat pockets at either end, stuffed with"
purchases. These are almost the only carrying bags. The men sling them
"over their shoulder, so that one great pocket hangs in front, one"
"""No, sir—far from it.  Let me hear you to the end.  I did see you take"
"forth a roll of paper from your breast as you came in.  That action,"
"together with your face, told me much.  You have the gift of a creative"
"fancy.  You have written a poem or a play."""
"""Neither the one nor the other, but a romance,"" answered Grey, the"
colour flushing his face as it flushes that of a maiden when the love of
"her heart is named by her.  ""I scarce know how to call it, but methinks"
it savours more of a romance than of aught besides.  When I was rudely
"awakened from my pleasure-loving life, saw the folly and futility"
"thereof, and desired to amend, I did take a quiet lodging high up in a"
"building off Holborn, and there I did set myself to the task, and right"
"happy was I in it.  I had a score of gold pieces still left me, and my"
"needs I did think modest; though, looking back, they seem many to me"
"now.  The weeks fled by, and my work reached its close.  When my romance"
"was finished, my money was all but spent.  For the past week or more I"
have been seeking a publisher for it.  In my folly I did think that it
would bring me gold as fast as I wanted.  My eyes have been rudely
"opened these last days."""
The Old Lion nodded his head many times.
"""You made a mistake in seeking a publisher, young sir.  You should first"
"have sought a patron."""
"Grey’s face flushed slightly, and he hesitated before he spoke."
"""Others have said the same to me; but there are difficulties.  I have"
not learned to go cap in hand to cringe for patronage to the great ones
"of the earth.""  But, as Grey saw a slight smile flicker in the old man’s"
"eyes, he added rather hastily, ""And then I desire not to be known and"
announced that the prisoner had been placed in cell No. 2. Dawson
"sprang up. ""We will have a look at him through the peephole, and if it"
"is our man--"" One glance was enough. Before me I saw him whom I had"
expected to see. He and his cargo of whisky bottles had reached the
"last stage of their long journey; at one end had been peace, reasonable"
"prosperity, and a happy home; at the other was, perhaps, a rope or a"
bullet.
"Dawson began once more to descant upon his own astuteness, but I was"
too sick at heart to listen. I remembered only the visit years before
"which that man's wife had paid to me. ""Will you not open the parcel?"""
"I interposed. He fell upon it, exposed its contents of bread,"
"chocolate, and sardine tins, and called for a can opener. He shook the"
"tins one by one beside his ear, and then, selecting that which gave"
"out no ""flop"" of oil, stripped it open, plunged his fingers inside,"
and pulled forth a clammy mess of putty and sawdust. In a moment he
had come upon a paper which after reading he handed to me. It bore the
"words in English, ""Informant arrested: dare not send more."""
"""What a fool!"" cried Dawson. ""As if the evidence against him were not"
"sufficient already he must give us this."""
"""You will let that poor devil of a draughtsman down easily?"" I"
murmured.
"""We want him as a witness,"" replied Dawson. ""Tit for tat. If he helps"
"us, we will help him. And now we will cut along to the Admiral. He is"
"eager for news."""
"We broke in upon the Admiral in his office near the shipyards, and he"
"greeted me with cheerful badinage. ""So you are in the hands of the"
"police at last, Copplestone. I always told you what would be the end"
face had lighted at the girl’s words.
"""Methought I had come to a world where naught was dreamed of save"
"fashion and frippery, false adulation and falser scorn.  I am well-nigh"
"stunned by the clamour of tongues, the strife of parties, the bustle of"
"this gay life of fashion."""
"""Oh, and I too—I too!"" breathed the girl softly: and he flashed at her a"
"quick, keen glance of sympathy and interest."
"""I was bred in the country; my grandam brought me up.  I lived with my"
"books, amid silvan solitudes, the songs of birds, the scent of flowers."
This great glittering world of folly and fashion is like a fiery wheel
"going round in my head.  Ofttimes I could cry aloud for mercy, the pain"
and bewilderment are so great.  I know there must be noble men and good
"in this strange Pandemonium; but I know not where to find them, and my"
heart grows sick.  Would that I could go back to my books and my dreams!
"But alas! a maiden may not choose for herself."""
"""Still there is life here,"" spoke Grey quickly, ""and it behoves us to"
know men as well as books.  I have studied both.  I will study them
"again.  I would fain learn all that life has to teach, whether for weal"
or woe.  No hermit-monk was ever truly a man. Yet there be times when
"one shrinks in amaze from all one sees and hears."""
The chord of sympathy was struck.  They passed from one thing to
another.  She found one at last who knew and loved the poets of her
"childhood’s dreams—who could talk of Spenser and Sidney, of Watson,"
"Greville, and Drayton, quoting their verses, and often lighting upon her"
"favourite passages.  Here was a man who knew Milton and Clarendon,"
"Hobbes, Herbert, Lovelace and Suckling, Lord Herbert of Cherbury and"
"Izaak Walton.  He had read eagerly, like herself, poetry and prose,"
"And the people answered her, and told her who it was. And when she"
"heard, she fell down upon the road as one dead: for it was her father"
"and mother who had died yesterday, and it was their funeral train that"
"she saw. They were all dead now, husband and sons and father and mother;"
in all the world she was quite alone.
"So she went mad, for her trouble was more than she could bear. She threw"
"off all her clothes, and let down her long hair and wrapped it about her"
"naked body, and walked about raving."
"At last she came to where the Buddha was teaching, seated under a"
"fig-tree. She came up to the Buddha, and told him of her losses, and how"
she had no one left; and she demanded of the Buddha that he should
restore to her those that she had lost. And the Buddha had great
"compassion upon her, and tried to console her."
"'All die,' he said; 'it comes to everyone, king and peasant, animal and"
man. Only through many deaths can we obtain the Great Peace. All this
"sorrow,' he said, 'is of the earth. All this is passion which we must"
"get rid of, and forget before we reach heaven. Be comforted, my"
"daughter, and turn to the holy life. All suffer as you do. It is part of"
"our very existence here, sorrow and trouble without any end.'"
"But she would not be comforted, but demanded her dead of the Buddha."
"Then, because he saw it was no use talking to her, that her ears were"
"deaf with grief, and her eyes blinded with tears, he said to her that he"
would restore to her those who were dead.
"'You must go,' he said, 'my daughter, and get some mustard-seed, a pinch"
"of mustard-seed, and I can bring back their lives. Only you must get"
this seed from the garden of him near whom death has never come. Get
"to which, thanks to the Captain's co-operation, he had fallen."
"""Now, then, my friend!"" said the Captain, glancing critically at the"
"restored client, ""we have a coat and jacket.  When I had respectable"
trousers I lived in town like a respectable man.  But when the trousers
"wore out, I too fell off in the opinion of my fellow-men and had to"
"come down here from the town.  Men, my fine mannikin, judge everything"
"by the outward appearance, while, owing to their foolishness, the"
actual reality of things is incomprehensible to them.  Make a note of
"this on your nose, and pay me at least half your debt.  Go in peace;"
"seek, and you may find."""
"""How much do I owe you, Aristid Fomich?"" asks the client, in confusion."
"""One rouble and 70 kopecks....  Now, give me only one rouble, or, if"
"you like, 70 kopecks, and as for the rest, I shall wait until you have"
"earned more than you have now by stealing or by hard work, it does not"
"matter to me."""
"""I thank you humbly for your kindness!"" says the client, touched to the"
"heart.  ""Truly you are a kind man....; Life has persecuted you in"
"vain....  What an eagle you would have been in your own place!"""
The Captain could not live without eloquent speeches.
"""What does 'in my own place' mean?  No one really knows his own place"
"in life, and every one of us crawls into his harness.  The place of the"
"merchant Judas Petunikoff ought to be in penal servitude, but he still"
"walks through the streets in daylight, and even intends to build a"
factory. The place of our teacher ought to be beside a wife and
"half-a-dozen children, but he is loitering in the public-house of"
"Vaviloff.  And then, there is yourself.  You are going to seek a"
was you. I'm so sorry I didn't have a chance to introduce you to mother
this morning. But mother wants me to take you back to the hotel. You
can have a room right next to mine and we'll have scads of fun--You'll
"come, won't you?"" For Sidney's face was unyielding."
"Like one cornered, Sidney stood straight against the table, her hands,"
"red from the hot dish water, clasped tightly behind her back. Though"
she knew that Pola was trying to make amends for her rudeness of the
"morning, something within her heart turned hard. The dusty idol was"
crumbling to bits of clay.
"""She's only inviting me because Mr. Dugald has told her to,"" she"
reasoned inwardly. And aloud she answered in a steady voice:
"""I'm sorry, but I simply can't leave Aunt Achsa. You must come here and"
"we'll find lots of jolly things to do--"""
"""Here?"" laughed Pola, glancing around the old kitchen."
"""Why not here?"" roared Mr. Dugald. ""As long as you've broken into our"
Secret Garden we'll introduce you to some things you've never done
before in your life. Only Sid will have to find some suitable clothes
"for you, and you'd better leave your complexion on the dressing table."""
"Pola accepted his banter good-naturedly. ""I shall be deeply grateful,"
"old dear, if you _will_ introduce me to any sensations I have not"
"experienced before. There, now, will that hold you for awhile?"" She"
"turned to Sidney. ""We quarrel like this all the time, but it's fun and"
I always have the last word. I make him so mad he can't think of
anything withering enough to say and I seize that strategic moment to
"cease firing. You see, I practice on Dug. I _will_ come tomorrow if I"
"may. Now, Duggie dear, lead me out of this funny lane or else I'll"
to prevent me. I had only to lie close among the rocks until Count
"Hugo left, and then I might plod back on foot and search as I pleased."
"In a flash I saw the poplars, and the road running beneath the"
"ash-tree, and the woman's body lying stiff and stark on the sward. And"
I burned to be there.
Left to myself I should have gone too. But the plan was no sooner
"formed than shattered. While I stood, hotfoot to be about it, and"
"pausing only to consider which way I could steal off most safely, a"
"rustling warned me that some one was coming, and before I could stir,"
a burly trooper broke through the bushes and confronted me. He saluted
me stolidly.
"'Sergeant,' he said, 'the general is waiting for you.'"
'The general?' I said.
"'The Count, if you like it better,' he answered. 'Come, if you"
please.'
"I followed him, full of vexation. It was but a step into the road. The"
"moment I appeared, some one gave the word 'Mount!' A horse was thrust"
"in front of me, two or three troopers who still remained afoot swung"
themselves into the saddle; and I followed their example. In a trice
"we were moving down the valley at a dull, steady pace--southwards,"
"southwards. I looked back, and saw the fir trees and rocks where we"
"had lain hidden, and then we turned a corner, and they were gone."
"Gone, and all round me I heard the measured tramp of the troop-horses,"
"the swinging tones of the men, and the clink and jingle of sword and"
"spur. I called myself a cur, but I went on, swept away by the force of"
"numbers, as the straw by the current. Once I caught Count Hugo's eye"
"fixed on me, and I fancied he had a message for me, but I failed to"
"was a curious hush--a new thing in their struggle, and one that seemed"
surcharged with calamity. After a moment Colonel Carmichael looked up.
"He was many years the senior of his companions, but just then there"
"seemed no difference in years between them. They were three wan,"
"haggard men, weakened with hunger, exhausted with sleepless watching."
That week had killed the youth in two of them.
"""Geoffries has just given me this,"" Carmichael said. ""It is a list of"
"our provisions. We have enough food, but there is no fresh water. The"
enemy has cut off the supply. We could not expect them to do
"otherwise."" He waited, and then, as neither spoke, he went on: ""I have"
"spoken with the others. You know, gentlemen, we can not go on another"
"twenty-four hours without water. We have made a good fight for it, but"
"this is the end. We must look the fact in the face."""
"""Surely they must know at headquarters what a state we are in--"""
Saunders began.
The Colonel shrugged his shoulders.
"""No doubt they know, but they can not help in time. This is not a"
petty frontier business. It is something worse--a rising with a leader.
"A rising with a leader is a lengthy business to tackle, and it"
"requires its victims. In this case we are the victims."" He smiled"
"grimly. ""We have only one thing left to do--make a dash for it while we"
have the strength. You must know as well as I do that there is
"scarcely anything worth calling a hope, but it's a more agreeable way"
of dying than being starved out like rats and then butchered like
"sheep. I know these devils."" He glanced around the shadowy room with a"
"curious light in his eyes. ""My best friend was murdered in this room,"""
"he added. ""Personally, I prefer a fair fight in the open."""
"“Fine man,” commented the younger man aloud. “Hope I do run into him"
"again. Meanwhile, however, the rear isn’t coming along half quick"
"enough, and I haven’t seen a darn thing all afternoon of the wangan. I"
hope nothing’s happened to it and the grub. That would be one awful
blow!”
It was one that was spared him. Within half an hour the clumsy scow hove
"in sight. It tied up to the bank a little later, and before dark"
preparations for supper were going on merrily.
Bob did not get in till later. Assured that all was well with the cook
"and his staff, he went on downstream to see how Peters and his gang were"
progressing. On his return he discovered a stranger warming himself by
"the drying fire. He looked like an old-time woodsman, and the instant"
"Bainbridge appeared he was on his feet, extracting an envelope from the"
interior of his hat.
"“From Mr. Tweedy, sir.”"
The young lumberman ripped it open without a premonition of the blow in
store for him. It was natural for Tweedy to write. He would be reporting
"his success in the matter of credit, of course, and probably gloating"
over the amount of manufactured lumber he had sold in so short a time.
Bainbridge noted that it had been written in the Bangor office the night
"before. Then, settling himself by the fire, he proceeded to read:"
"Dear Bobby: It’s all up with us, boy. We’re done, and we may as well"
admit it first as last and make what terms we can with the gang. I
can’t get credit anywhere. Crane’s been ahead of me and spilled the
"beans each time. What’s more, Gastich absolutely refuses to renew that"
"note. Says he must have the cash for some stocks he’s carrying, and"
"all that; but you know what it means. It’s due in less than a week,"
"What HAVE I done?""  No answer came.  And such rage against men flared up"
"that she just stood there, twisting her garden-gloves in her hands, and"
"biting the lips he would have kissed.  Then, going to her bureau, she"
"took up her address book and looked for the name: Wing, 88, Frankland"
"Street, Fulham. Unhooking her little bag from off the back of the chair,"
"she put her cheque-book into it.  Then, taking care to make no sound, she"
"passed into the hall, caught up her sunshade, and went out, closing the"
door without noise.
She walked quickly toward Baker Street.  Her gardening-hat was right
"enough, but she had come out without gloves, and must go into the first"
"shop and buy a pair.  In the choosing of them, she forgot her emotions"
"for a minute.  Out in the street again, they came back as bitterly as"
"ever.  And the day was so beautiful--the sun bright, the sky blue, the"
clouds dazzling white; from the top of her 'bus she could see all its
brilliance.  There rose up before her the memory of the man who had
"kissed her arm at the first ball.  And now--this!  But, mixed with her"
"rage, a sort of unwilling compassion and fellow feeling kept rising for"
"that girl, that silly, sugar-plum girl, brought to such a pass by--her"
husband. These feelings sustained her through that voyage to Fulham.  She
"got down at the nearest corner, walked up a widish street of narrow grey"
houses till she came to number eighty-eight.  On that newly scrubbed
"step, waiting for the door to open, she very nearly turned and fled."
What exactly had she come to do?
The door was opened by a servant in an untidy frock.  Mutton!  The smell
"of mutton--there it was, just as the girl had said!"
"""Is Miss--Miss Daphne Wing at home?"""
"In that peculiar ""I've given it up"" voice of domestics in small"
"households, the servant answered:"
and waited in the field. But this time there were several further
shell-bursts. No dull boom in the distance followed by a long-drawn
"whine, but only the earth and smoke thrown darkly up and then the"
deafening double detonation.
"The next day more shells came over, and the next day also."
The big holes with their earthen rims began to dot the fields in many
"places. No damage of ""military importance"" had been done. Not even a"
"soldier had been killed, but only an inoffensive cow."
"At night the sky was alive with the whirr of propellers, and shells"
whistled overhead and burst a long way off.
"One Sunday, toward the end of March, when we had a half-holiday, I"
walked up the hill that was crowned by a large monastery and sat down
on the slope by a group of sallows. They were in full bloom. A swarm of
bees and flies were buzzing round. Peacock and Tortoiseshell butterflies
were flitting to and fro. The sunlight filtered down through the bluish
haze. I rested and let an hour or two slip by. Then I got up and crossed
a little brook and strolled along a narrow path that wound its way
"through a copse. The ground was starred with wood-anemones, oxlips,"
"violets, cuckoo-flowers, and in damp places with green-golden saxifrage."
I came to a small cottage that had pots of flowers in every window. I
sat down while a hospitable old woman made coffee and chattered volubly
in Flemish. Another soldier arrived soon after. Had I heard the news?
The Germans had broken through on the Somme and had captured Bapaume. I
"asked him if he had seen it in print. No, he had heard it from an A.S.C."
"driver. He hoped it wasn't true, but he feared it was."
I returned to camp full of suppressed excitement.
falls--and over them.
"He took the drop easily, riding the log with that perfect balance which"
is second nature to the seasoned riverman. When the timber bumped
"against the rapidly forming jam, Curly leaped again, thrusting the log"
"down as he did so, and landed on the solid barrier. Scrambling lightly"
"over to the face of this, he thrust deftly with his peavey into the"
"mass, and began to work desperately to loosen the key log--that first"
"upended stick of pine which had started the whole trouble, and which"
must be started before the rest of the barrier would give.
"He got a good hold on it, but the thing defied his efforts to tear it"
"loose. It was wedged too tightly for even his great strength, and,"
"though he seemed to feel it move slightly, he strained his muscles to"
the utmost in vain to accomplish anything further. Presently he
"realized, with a thrill, that the jam was piling up behind him faster"
"and faster. He ceased his efforts, and clamping the peavey on timber"
"above the key log, pried it free, and sent it bobbing downstream."
"Another followed, and another still. Sweat poured in streams from him,"
"trickling blindingly into his eyes, but he did not stop to wipe it away."
"There was no time. He must go on doing his best till help came, or"
else----
A faint jar shook the jam. A second later Curly felt a hand lightly
touch his shoulder. A familiar voice sounded in his ear:
"“Good work, son! Where’s that trouble maker? Oh, I see. Let me drop down"
"to that ledge, where I can get a good hold. That’s the idea. Now grip"
"her above me. Fine! Ready, now? Yank away!”"
"It was Bainbridge--swift, agile, incredibly fresh considering what he"
had accomplished that day. For a moment or two Curly did not realize
were on the other side of the invisible screen.
"Determined however, to remove this invisible screen, I said"
"Good-evening, and it was very cold. They muttered Good-evening, and yes,"
it was fresh. An Italian never says it is cold: it is never more than
_fresco_. But this hint that it was cold they took as a hint at their
"caps, and they became very silent, till the woman came in with the"
"soup-bowl. Then they clamoured at her, particularly the _maialino_, what"
was there to eat. She told them--beef-steaks of pork. Whereat they
"pulled faces. Or bits of boiled pork. They sighed, looked gloomy,"
"cheered up, and said beef-steaks, then."
"And they fell on their soup. And never, from among the steam, have I"
heard a more joyful trio of soup-swilkering. They sucked it in from
"their spoons with long, gusto-rich sucks. The _maialino_ was the"
"treble--he trilled his soup into his mouth with a swift, sucking"
"vibration, interrupted by bits of cabbage, which made the lamp start to"
"dither again. Black-cap was the baritone; good, rolling spoon-sucks. And"
the one in spectacles was the bass: he gave sudden deep gulps. All was
"led by the long trilling of the _maialino_. Then suddenly, to vary"
"matters, he cocked up his spoon in one hand, chewed a huge mouthful of"
"bread, and swallowed it down with a smack-smack-smack! of his tongue"
"against his palate. As children we used to call this ""clapping""."
"""Mother, she's clapping!"" I would yell with anger, against my sister."
The German word is schmatzen.
"So the _maialino_ clapped like a pair of cymbals, while baritone and"
bass rolled on. Then in chimed the swift bright treble.
"At this rate however, the soup did not last long. Arrived the"
beef-steaks of pork. And now the trio was a trio of castanet smacks and
friends and forget all about the army and the war. I would be gay and
"frivolous and go to theatres, music-halls and cafés. And one day I would"
spend in the British Museum and lose myself in books--that would be
"just like old times! Of course, our leave would not last for ever and"
the return journey would be terrible. No doubt the fortnight would pass
"very quickly, but I determined to enjoy every single hour with"
"deliberation and understanding, and to squeeze every drop of pleasure"
out of it. How many hours were there in a fortnight? More than three
"hundred! Many would be wasted in sleep, but still, there would be many"
"left and by dwelling upon each one, the fortnight would seem an age."
*       *       *       *       *
An afternoon and an evening in a train that travelled all too slowly. A
night and half a day at Calais Rest Camp. How terrible was the rankling
impatience that gnawed our hearts as the hours dragged on.
"But at last we were on the leave boat. There was another long delay, and"
"then, with a feeling of immense relief, we heard the engines throb and"
the paddle-wheels begin to turn. I looked overboard and saw white foam
hissing along the surface of water rapidly widening between us and the
quay.
Seventeen months of exile and slavery had come to an end and before us
lay a wonderful fortnight of freedom and happiness. And at the end of
the fortnight? There was no need to think of that now.
The sea was blue and smooth and a cool breeze was blowing. We saw the
cliffs of England grow larger and larger. Soon we were able to
"distinguish the town of Dover, the houses clustered round the harbour,"
and the Castle up on the cliff. It was there that I had begun my career
as a soldier more than two years before. How much had happened since
"Several voices muttered ""Thank God,"" but one man's teeth were still"
chattering as though he was so absorbed by his own fear that he had not
noticed the disappearance of its cause. Soon there was complete silence
and one by one we fell asleep.
Another clear day and another clear night. We lay awake listening
anxiously to the bursting of bombs and the muttering of anti-aircraft
fire. But we went to sleep in the end and felt drowsy all the following
day--a clear day. Casualties came in from a camp that had been bombed
"overnight, and we saw shattered limbs, smashed heads, and lacerated"
flesh. Several of our men were looking pale through lack of sleep and
had dark rings round their eyes.
"Another clear night. The agonizing vigil began again, but I was so weary"
that I went to sleep a few minutes after lights out. Sullen thunders
mingled with my dreams and did not wake me up.
Another clear day. Would the fine weather never end? Late in the
"afternoon, however, a few clouds collected on the horizon. In the"
evening the entire sky was overcast and not a star was to be seen. And
as we went to bed we heard the rain swishing down upon the canvas roof.
The unspeakable joy we all felt at the prospect of an untroubled night!
"""Bloody fine, this rain: we'll get some proper sleep now, thank God. I"
"never had the wind up so much in all my life, and I've been out here"
"since '15 and in some pretty hot places too."""
"""I reckon the longer yer out 'ere the windier yer get. I joined up in"
'14 like a bloody fool. At first I didn't care a damn for anything. Then
I was wounded on the Somme an' sent across to Blighty. I dreaded comin'
"back agin. I only 'ad a little wound in me 'and, an' I used ter plug it"
"wi' dubbin' an' boot-polish ter keep it raw. It didn't 'alf 'urt, but it"
*       *       *       *       *
The train was running over the malarial-looking sea-plain--past the
"down-at-heel palm trees, past the mosque-looking buildings. At a level"
crossing the woman crossing-keeper darted out vigorously with her red
flag. And we rambled into the first village. It was built of sun-dried
"brick-adobe houses, thick adobe garden-walls, with tile ridges to keep"
off the rain. In the enclosures were dark orange trees. But the
"clay-coloured villages, clay-dry, looked foreign: the next thing to mere"
"earth they seem, like fox-holes or coyote colonies."
"Looking back, one sees Cagliari bluff on her rock, rather fine, with the"
thin edge of the sea's blade curving round. It is rather hard to believe
"in the real sea, on this sort of clay-pale plain."
*       *       *       *       *
But soon we begin to climb to the hills. And soon the cultivation begins
"to be intermittent. Extraordinary how the heathy, moor-like hills come"
near the sea: extraordinary how scrubby and uninhabited the great spaces
"of Sardinia are. It is wild, with heath and arbutus scrub and a sort of"
"myrtle, breast-high. Sometimes one sees a few head of cattle. And then"
"again come the greyish arable-patches, where the corn is grown. It is"
"like Cornwall, like the Land's End region. Here and there, in the"
"distance, are peasants working on the lonely landscape. Sometimes it is"
"one man alone in the distance, showing so vividly in his black-and-white"
"costume, small and far-off like a solitary magpie, and curiously"
distinct. All the strange magic of Sardinia is in this sight. Among the
"low, moor-like hills, away in a hollow of the wide landscape one"
"solitary figure, small but vivid black-and-white, working alone, as if"
"eternally. There are patches and hollows of grey arable land, good for"
corn. Sardinia was once a great granary.
"""That's the end o' that--that's the end o' that,"" she wound up, slamming"
the door after him. But all the way from the threshold to the bureau she
"kept murmuring to herself: ""I don't care, I don't care . . . I'll be"
like the rest o' the women I've seen. I'll give that Nina Micheltoreña
"cards an' spades. There'll be another hussy around here. There'll be--"""
"The threat was never finished. Instead, with eyes that fairly started"
"out of their sockets, she listened to the sound of a couple of shots,"
the last one exploding so loud and distinct that there was no mistaking
its nearness to the cabin.
"""They've got 'im!"" she cried. ""Well, I don't care--I don't--"" But again"
she did not finish what she intended to say. For at the sound of a heavy
"body falling against the cabin door she flew to it, opened it and,"
"throwing her arms about the sorely-wounded man, dragged him into the"
cabin and placed him in a chair. Quick as lightning she was back at the
door bolting it.
With his eyes Johnson followed her action.
"""Don't lock that door--I'm going out again--out there. Don't bar that"
"door,"" he commanded feebly, struggling to his feet and attempting to"
walk towards it; but he lurched forward and would have fallen to the
"floor had she not caught him. Vainly he strove to break away from her,"
"all the time crying out: ""Don't you see, don't you see, Girl--open the"
"door."" And then again with almost a sob: ""Do you think me a man to hide"
"behind a woman?"" He would have collapsed except for the strong arms that"
held him.
"""I love you an' I'm goin' to save you,"" the Girl murmured while"
"struggling with him. ""You asked me to go away with you; I will when you"
"git out o' this. If you can't save your own soul--"" She stopped and"
quickly went over to the mantel where she took down a bottle of whisky
soon found it; but there I came to a check. Round the churchyard stood
"a number of quiet family houses, many-gabled and shaded by limes, and"
doubtless once occupied by reverend canons and prebendaries. But no
"one of these held such a position that it could shoulder Herr Krapp's,"
or be by any possibility the house I wanted. The churchyard lay too
far from the street for that.
I walked up the row twice before I would admit this; but at last I
"made it certain. Still Herr Krapp must know his own premises, and not"
"much cast down, I was going to knock at a chance door and put the"
"question, when my eyes fell on a man who sat at work in the"
"churchyard. He wore a mason's apron, and was busily deepening the"
inscription on a tablet let into the church wall. He seemed to be the
"very man to know, and I went to him."
"'I want a house which looks into the Neu Strasse,' I said. 'It is the"
next house to Herr Krapp's. Can you direct me to the door?'
"He looked at me for a moment, his hammer suspended. Then he pointed to"
"the farther end of the row. 'There is an alley,' he said in a hoarse,"
croaking voice. 'The door is at the end.'
"I thought his occupation an odd one, considering the state of the"
"city; but I had other things to dwell on, and hastened off to the"
"place he indicated. Here, sure enough, I found the mouth of a very"
"narrow passage which, starting between the last house and a blind"
"wall, ran in the required direction. It was a queer place, scarcely"
"wider than my shoulders, and with two turns so sharp that I remember"
wondering how they brought their dead out. In one part it wound under
"the timbers of a house; it was dark and somewhat foul, and altogether"
so ill-favoured a path that I was glad I had brought my arms.
"""Lady, you have asked a hard question, inasmuch as I know but little of"
"the man, albeit I have lived with him above a month.  He attracts me,"
and yet there be moments when he repels me too.  He is a good friend—I
would not speak a word against him; yet it is said that he can be a
bitter and an unscrupulous enemy; and those who have lost his favour
"withdraw themselves as speedily as possible from his notice, fearful"
"lest some evil may befall them."""
"""Is he then cruel and rancorous?"""
"""I can believe that he might be, were his passions roused.  He has that"
forceful nature which tends to vehement liking and bitter hatred.  I
"have experienced the one; I have not tasted of the other.  For the rest,"
"he is a man of parts, and can do all well to which he puts his hand."
Methinks he would be strong enough to break off his reckless and vicious
"habits, had he but motive sufficient to make him! desire to do so.  But"
"for the nonce he floats with the current, and lives as the world lives."
"More I cannot say."""
"At that moment a swift, firm tread was heard approaching along the dim"
"alley; and Geraldine looked hastily round, her hand dropping from Grey’s"
arm.
"""It is he!"" she whispered, and there was a catch in her voice which the"
"young man heard without understanding.  He faced round, and beheld the"
towering figure of Lord Sandford beside them.
"""Well chanced upon!"" quoth he in his resonant tones.  ""I was sent by"
"your mother in search of you, Lady Geraldine.  The court of beauty has"
sat.  To her has been adjudged the prize.  She now desires the presence
"of her daughter, to share her triumph. We shall sup anon, and the table"
will not be complete without one gracious and lovely presence. Lady
"courage, I think we should have stayed there till daylight, and been"
caught like birds limed on a bough.
"As it was, we plunged and strove for more than an hour in that place,"
"the dark sky above us, the quaking bog below, the women's weeping in"
"our ears. Then, at last, when I had almost given up hope, we struggled"
"out one by one upon the road, and stood panting and shaking,"
astonished to find solid ground under our feet. We had still two miles
"to walk, but on dry soil; and though at another time the task might"
"have seemed to the women full of adventure and arduous, it failed to"
frighten them after what we had gone through. Steve took Fraulein
"Anna, and I one of the women. My lady and the Waldgrave went hand in"
"hand; the one giving, I fancy, as much help as the other. For Marie,"
"her small, white face was a beacon of hope in the darkness. In the"
marsh she had never failed or fainted. On the road the tears came into
my eyes for pity and love and admiration.
"At length Steve bade us stand, and leaving us in the way, plunged into"
"the denser blackness of a thicket, which lay between it and the river."
"I heard him parting the branches before him, and stumbling and"
"swearing, until presently the sounds died away in the distance, and we"
remained shivering and waiting. What if the horses were gone? What if
they had strayed from the place where he had tethered them early in
"the day, or some one had found and removed them? The thought threw me"
into a cold sweat.
"Then I heard him coming back, and I caught the ring of iron hoofs. He"
"had them! I breathed again. In a moment he emerged, and behind him a"
string of shadows--five horses tied head and tail.
'Quick!' he muttered. He had been long enough alone to grow nervous.
"'We are two hours gone, and if they have not yet discovered him they"
"body into which we may be born. It is the first duty of a monk, of him"
"who is trying to lead the purer life, to kill all these affections, or"
rather to blend them into one great compassion to all the world alike.
"'Gayüna,' compassion, that is the only passion that will be left to"
us. So say the learned.
"I met a little girl not long ago, a wee little maiden about seven years"
"old, and she told me all about her former life when she was a man. Her"
"name was Maung Mon, she said, and she used to work the dolls in a"
travelling marionette show. It was through her knowledge and partiality
"for marionettes that it was first suspected, her parents told me, whom"
she had been in her former life. She could even as a sucking-child
manipulate the strings of a marionette-doll. But the actual discovery
"came when she was about four years old, and she recognised a certain"
"marionette booth and dolls as her own. She knew all about them, knew"
"the name of each doll, and even some of the words they used to say in"
"the plays. 'I was married four times,' she told me. 'Two wives died, one"
"I divorced; one was living when I died, and is living still. I loved her"
"very much indeed. The one I divorced was a dreadful woman. See,'"
"pointing to a scar on her shoulder, 'this was given me once in a"
quarrel. She took up a chopper and cut me like this. Then I divorced
her. She had a dreadful temper.'
It was immensely quaint to hear this little thing discoursing like this.
"The mark was a birth-mark, and I was assured that it corresponded"
exactly with one that had been given to the man by his wife in just such
a quarrel as the one the little girl described.
The divorced wife and the much-loved wife are still alive and not yet
old. The last wife wanted the little girl to go and live with her. I
asked her why she did not go.
"""Why? How can I tell? You said it was to make sure that the shore"
"party were all off the ship."""
"""I said! What does it matter what I say! What I do matters a heap, but"
what I say--pouf! I sent Trehayne to the _Antigone_ to test him. I
"sent him expecting that he would try to cut her wires, and he did."
"Then when I was sure, though I had no evidence for a law court, I sent"
"him to the _Malplaquet_, and I set my trap there for him to walk into."
How did I guess? I don't guess; I watch. The more valuable a man is to
"me, the more I watch him, for he might be even more valuable to"
"somebody else. Trehayne was an excellent man, but he had not been with"
me a month before I was watching him as closely as any cat. I hadn't
been a Marine and served ashore and afloat without knowing a born
"gentleman when I see one, and knowing, too, the naval stamp. Trehayne"
was too much of a gentleman to have become a workman in the _Vernon_
and at Greenock without some very good reason. He said that he was an
"orphan--yes; he said his parents left him penniless, and he had to"
"earn his living the best way he could--yes. Quite good reasons, but"
"they didn't convince me. I was certain sure that somewhere, some time,"
Trehayne had been a naval officer. I had seen too many during my
service to make any mistake about that. So when I stood there waiting
"in that damned cold corner behind that bulkhead, it was for Trehayne"
that I was waiting. I meant to take him or to kill him. When he killed
"himself, I was glad. As I watched his eyes fade out, it was as if my"
own son was dying on his feet in front of me. But it was better so
"than to die in front of a firing party. For I--I loved him, and I"
"wished him 'Good-bye,'"""
"Dawson pitched his cigar into the fire, got up, and walked away to the"
far side of the room. I had never till that moment completely
"reverenced the penetrative, infallible judgment of Little Jane."
"He was never short of money, for he had a purse which was never empty."
"He never was short of food, for he had a table-cloth on which, as soon"
"as he spread it, he found all he wanted to eat and drink. And, besides,"
he had a magic wishing cap. When he put it on he could wish himself
"wherever he wanted, and there he would be that very moment."
"There was only one thing that he lacked: he had no wife, and he was"
gradually coming into the years when it would be necessary for him to
make haste.
"As he was walking sadly along one fine day, it occurred to him to wish"
himself where he would find the most beautiful princess in the world. No
sooner had he thought of it than he was there. And it was a land which
"he had never yet seen, and a city in which he had never yet been. And"
"the king had a daughter, so handsome that he had never yet beheld her"
"like, and he wanted to have her on the spot. But she would have nothing"
"to do with him, and was very haughty."
"Finally he despaired altogether, and was so beside himself that he could"
no longer be where she was not. So he took his magic cap and wished
"himself into the castle. He wanted to say good-by, so he said. And she"
"laid her hand in his. ""I wish we were far beyond the end of the world!"""
"said the youth, and there they were. But the king's daughter wept, and"
begged to be allowed to go home again. He could have all the gold and
"silver in the castle in return. ""I have money enough for myself,"" said"
"the youth, and he shook his purse so that money just rolled about. He"
"could sit down at the royal table and eat the finest food, and drink the"
"finest wines, said she. ""I have enough to eat and drink myself,"" said"
"the youth. ""See, you can sit down at the table,"" said he, and at once he"
spread his table-cloth. And there stood a table covered with the best
one might wish; and the king himself ate no better.
"too. Besides, Josephine has little to play and be cheerful for; things"
"have gone badly this year, and may grow worse as time goes on. The"
"prospect is not a good one. ""But something will turn up,"" says Josephine."
"She need not worry, for she has money in the bank, and no doubt there is a"
"young man in the offing, on the other side of the fjeld."
"Oh, yes, Josephine will always manage; she thinks of everything. The other"
"day, for instance--when Miss Torsen and her friend left. The friend could"
"not pay his bill, and all he said was that he had expected money, but it"
"hadn't come, and he couldn't stay any longer because of his private"
"affairs. That was all very well, but when would the bill be paid? Why, he"
"would send it from the town, of course; that was where he had his money!"
"""But how do we know we'll get the money?--from him, anyway,"" said"
"Josephine. ""We've had these actor-people here before. And I didn't like"
"the way he swanked about outside, thinking he was as good as anybody, and"
throwing his stick up in the air and catching it again. And then when Miss
"Torsen came in to say good-bye, I told her, and I wondered if she couldn't"
"let me have the money for him. Miss Torsen was shocked, and said, 'Hasn't"
"he paid himself?' 'No,' I said, 'he hasn't, and this year being such a bad"
"one, we need every penny.' So then Miss Torsen said of course we should"
"get the money; how much was it? And I told her, and she said she couldn't"
"pay for him now, but she would see the money was sent; we could trust her"
"for that. And I think we can, too. We'll get the money all right, if not"
"from him. I daresay she'll send it herself...."""
And Josephine went off to serve me my dinner.
"Paul is on his feet now, too. Not that his step is always very steady, but"
at least he puts his feet to the ground. But he takes no interest in
things; he does little more than feeding the horses and chopping some
wood. He ought to be clearing the manure out of the summer cow houses for
"himself into an armchair with another laugh, telling Grey he was sorry"
"his knaves of servants, who looked for perquisites everywhere, had let"
"in this flood of rogues upon him, but added that he must needs have the"
"wherewithal to cut a proper figure in London town, and forthwith set"
about the business of ordering an outfit for the young man which almost
took his guest’s breath away.
"""Poof!"" he cried, when the latter strove to remonstrate, ""you have"
plenty of money; and these rascals can wait if it suits your pleasure.
"Father’s memory!  Oh, be hanged to all such mawkish sentiment!  You need"
not think less of your father because you wear a blue coat in lieu of a
black! Rabbit me! but you are of a different world from this if you keep
"alive your father’s memory for six months after his decease!  No, no;"
you must cut a figure.  Sir Hugh’s name is clean forgot by now. I’ll eat
my boots if ’tis not so.  I’ll have you as gay as my fancy paints you.
"No black—no sables for the gentleman, I tell you.  Let us see those"
"other patterns.  Ah! here is something more like."""
"Grey submitted.  In sooth, he cared but little for the colour of his"
"clothes, or the set of his hat, or the cut of his coat.  He let Lord"
"Sandford have his way for the most part, only insisting here and there"
"upon soft and tender tints, and showing a predilection for white, which"
his friend quite approved.
"""You shall be a foil to me, not a rival.  I have learned that art from"
the ladies.  I like to blaze like old Sol in his strength; you shall
rather recall gentle Luna amid her galaxy of stars.  Faugh! One’s tongue
"gets into this silly trick of speech, so that one cannot drop it even"
betwixt man and man!  But you are right to think that white becomes you
"well.  You will look a pretty fellow, in all conscience, when you have"
"added a peruke to your other adornments."""
which had acted upon him like a charm.  It brought back to him the
"memory of his mother, and her noble dignity.  The look in her eyes"
"recalled those things that he had learned at her knee, and those"
aspirations after true greatness of life which she had cherished and
"fostered. Suddenly his present life looked to him utterly sordid, mean,"
"and unworthy; and in a burst of confidence, for which he could have"
"given no reason, he told her all his tale, encouraged by the soft and"
"earnest glances of her beautiful eyes, although she scarcely spoke a"
word from beginning to end.
And now she looked at him with a great compassion in her face.
"""Oh, it is sad, it is sad!"" she said in her earnest musical tones.  ""I"
know a little how sad it is.  I see it too.  But you are a man.  You are
"strong, you are your own master.  Why do you let yourself be made the"
"sport and plaything of fate?  Oh, do not do it! Rise to your calling as"
"a man, as a gentleman, as a Christian!  You can—I know you can!  I read"
it in your face!  What is Lord Sandford to you? The acquaintance of a
few weeks.  What are his comrades to you?  You know that in your heart
you despise them.  Then will you make yourself as one of them?  Will you
"sink to their level?  Oh no, no, no!  Break the fetters; they cannot be"
"fast riveted yet.  Break them, and stand a free man, and then see what"
"the world has to offer you."""
"She was gazing at him now, not shyly, not as a maiden archly coquetting"
"with a handsome young swain, but as a woman yearning to reclaim one"
"whose footsteps had well-nigh slipped in the mire, and whose whole soul"
was stirred by the effort.
"Grey listened like a man who dreams; and yet his eyes were on fire, and"
"his heart was kindled to a great flame—shame at his own weakness,"
yearnings after vanished memories and half-forgotten aspirations
*       *       *       *       *
All the stations so far had had wire netting over the windows. This
means malaria-mosquitoes. The malaria climbs very high in Sardinia. The
"shallow upland valleys, moorland with their intense summer sun and the"
"riverless, boggy behaviour of the water breed the pest inevitably. But"
"not very terribly, as far as one can make out: August and September"
being the danger months. The natives don't like to admit there is any
"malaria: a tiny bit, they say, a tiny bit. As soon as you come to the"
_trees_ there is no more. So they say. For many miles the landscape is
"moorland and down-like, with no trees. But wait for the trees. Ah, the"
woods and forests of Gennargentu: the woods and forests higher up: no
malaria there!
"The little engine whisks up and up, around its loopy curves as if it"
were going to bite its own tail: we being the tail: then suddenly dives
over the sky-line out of sight. And the landscape changes. The famous
"woods begin to appear. At first it is only hazel-thickets, miles of"
"hazel-thickets, all wild, with a few black cattle trying to peep at us"
out of the green myrtle and arbutus scrub which forms the undergrowth;
"and a couple of rare, wild peasants peering at the train. They wear the"
"black sheepskin tunic, with the wool outside, and the long stocking"
caps. Like cattle they too peer out from between deep bushes. The myrtle
"scrub here rises man-high, and cattle and men are smothered in it. The"
big hazels rise bare above. It must be difficult getting about in these
parts.
"Sometimes, in the distance one sees a black-and-white peasant riding"
"lonely across a more open place, a tiny vivid figure. I like so much the"
proud instinct which makes a living creature distinguish itself from its
background. I hate the rabbity khaki protection-colouration. A
"black-and-white peasant on his pony, only a dot in the distance beyond"
"the train. In vain. The train inexorably pursues its course. Prancing,"
she reaches one end of the platform as we leave the other end. Then she
"realizes it is not going to stop for her. And then, oh horror, her long"
arms thrown out in wild supplication after the retreating train: then
flung aloft to God: then brought down in absolute despair on her head.
"And this is the last sight we have of her, clutching her poor head in"
agony and doubling forward. She is left--she is abandoned.
The poor fat husband has been all the time on the little outside
"platform at the end of the carriage, holding out his hand to her and"
shouting frenzied scolding to her and frenzied yells for the train to
stop. And the train has not stopped. And she is left--left on that
God-forsaken station in the waning light.
"So, his face all bright, his eyes round and bright as two stars,"
"absolutely transfigured by dismay, chagrin, anger and distress, he comes"
"and sits in his seat, ablaze, stiff, speechless. His face is almost"
beautiful in its blaze of conflicting emotions. For some time he is as
if unconscious in the midst of his feelings. Then anger and resentment
"crop out of his consternation. He turns with a flash to the long-nosed,"
"insidious, Phoenician-looking guard. Why couldn't they stop the train"
"for her! And immediately, as if someone had set fire to him, off flares"
the guard. Heh!--the train can't stop for every person's convenience!
The train is a train--the time-table is a time-table. What did the old
woman want to take her trips down the line for? Heh! She pays the
penalty for her own inconsiderateness. Had _she_ paid for the
train--heh? And the fat man all the time firing off his unheeding and
"unheeded answers. One minute--only one minute--if he, the conductor had"
"told the driver! if he, the conductor, had shouted! A poor woman! Not"
another train! What was she going to do! Her ticket? And no money. A
poor woman--
"her, too! I only wish that I might get the chance to see her sometime!"""
"said he. ""Well, just wait until to-morrow,"" said the giant, ""and then I"
"will lead you to her myself,"" he said. ""A thousand thanks, master,"" said"
"the king's son, ""but I think you are only joking!"" The following day the"
giant took him to the Master Girl.
"""Now you must slaughter him, and cook him in the big kettle, you know"
"which one I mean. And when the soup is ready, you can call me,"" said the"
"giant, and he lay down on the bench to sleep, and at once began to snore"
"so that the hills shook. Then the Master Girl took a knife, and cut the"
"youth's little finger, and let three drops of blood fall on the bench."
"Then she took all the old rags, and old shoes and other rubbish she"
"could find, and threw them all into the kettle. And then she took a"
"chest of gold-dust, and a lick-stone, and a bottle of water that hung"
"over the door, and a golden apple, and two golden hens, and left the"
giant's castle together with the king's son as quickly as possible.
"After a time they came to the sea, and they sailed across; though where"
they got the ship I do not exactly know.
"Now when the giant had been sleeping quite a while, he began to stretch"
"himself on his bench. ""Is dinner ready yet?"" he asked. ""Just begun!"""
said the first drop of blood on the bench. Then the giant turned
"around, went to sleep again, and went on sleeping for quite some time."
"Then he again turned around a little. ""Is dinner not ready yet?"" he"
"said, but did not open his eyes--nor had he done so the first time--for"
"he was still half asleep. ""It is half ready!"" called out the second drop"
"of blood, and then the giant thought it was the Master Girl. He turned"
around on the bench and took another nap. After he had slept a couple of
"hours longer, he once more began to move about and stretch: ""Is dinner"
"still not ready?"" said he. ""Ready!"" answered the third drop of blood."
The giant sat up and rubbed his eyes. But he could not see who had
"called him, and so he called out to the Master Girl. But no one answered"
"""Ah!"" cried the girl, laying her hand again on his cuff, ""that is"
because they do not wish you to share their plunder. But tell them that
you care nothing for that and they will welcome you readily enough. The
"place is plague-stricken, I tell you. The palace lies open. Little"
crook-backed Chepe brought me word. He says he adores me. He is of the
"village of Frias, back there behind the hills. I do not love him, even"
"though he has a bitter heart and can hate well. Therefore I suffer him."""
The Sergeant rose to his feet and looked compassionately down at the
"vivid little figure before him. The hair, dense and black, the blue"
"eyes, the red-knotted handkerchief, the white teeth that showed between"
the parted lips clean and sharp as those of a wild animal. Cardono had
"seen many things on his travels, but never anything like this. His soul"
"was moved within him. In the deeps of his heart, the heart of a Spanish"
"gipsy, there was an infinite sympathy for any one who takes up the blood"
"feud, who, in the face of all difficulties, swears the _vendetta_. But"
"the slim arms, the spare willowy body, the little white sandalled feet"
of the little girl--these overcame him with a pitifully amused sense of
the disproportion of means to end.
"""Have you no brother, Señorita?"" he said, using by instinct the title of"
respect which the little girl loved the most. She saw his point in a
moment.
"""A brother--yes, Don José! But my brother is a cur, a dog that eats"
offal. Pah! I spit upon him. He hath taken favours from the woman. He
hath handled her money. He would clean the shoes they twain leave at
their chamber door. A brother--yes; the back of my hand to such
brothers! But after to-night he shall have no offal to eat--no bones
thrown under the table to pick. For in one slaying I will kill the
"Italian woman Cristina, the man Muñoz who broke my mother's heart, and"
the foisted changeling brat whom they miscall the daughter of Fernando
for ever. But I _wouldn't_ think about it. I _would_ enjoy the present.
But the calm waters of happiness had been ruffled and it was beyond my
"power to restore their tranquillity. I began to think of many things, of"
"the war itself, of the possible offensive, and soon the fretful"
"rebellious discontent, that obsessed all those of us who had not lost"
"their souls, began to reassert itself."
But why not desert? Why not escape to the south of France? Why not enjoy
"a week, a fortnight, a month of freedom? I would be caught in the end--I"
"would be punished. I would receive Number 1 Field Punishment, and I"
"would be tied to a wheel or post, but nevertheless it would be worth"
it! I imagined myself slipping out of camp at night and walking until
"dawn. Then I would sleep in some wood or copse and then walk on again,"
calling at remote farms to buy bread and eggs and milk. I would reach
"the little village, the main street winding between white houses and"
flooded with brilliant moonlight. I would climb the wall and drop into
the familiar garden and await the morning. Then I would knock at the
"door and I would be welcomed by an old peasant woman, and she would ask:"
"""Tu viens en perme?"" How could I answer that question? It worried me, I"
felt it was spoiling my dream. But I dreamt on and at the same time
battled against increasing depression. Even a few days of freedom would
"be a break, a change from routine. And would the little village be the"
"same as when I saw it last? No, it would be different, it would be at"
"war. I might escape from the army, but I could never escape from the"
war. My dream had vanished.
But I _would_ make the best of things. I _would_ enjoy the immediate
present--was I not losing hours of sheer pleasure by harbouring these
thoughts and ignoring the beauty of the day?
Some distance ahead was a farm of the usual Flemish type--a thatched
"roof, whitewashed walls, and green shutters. Near by was a little pond"
"The event increased our uneasiness. After each ""bombing-stunt"" we"
"thought: ""We were lucky this time--it will be our turn next though."""
"Moreover, we began to realize our helplessness. We were compelled to"
remain in our tents during a raid and there was no possibility of taking
shelter. We could have put on our steel helmets--they would at least
"have afforded some head protection, but hardly any of us had the courage"
to do anything that might be regarded by the others as a sign of fear.
The discussion about the bombing of hospitals had made us all think of
air-raids. We had nearly finished our day's work when we noticed a few
clouds on the horizon. We felt relieved. Perhaps the sky would be
overcast and we would have an undisturbed night.
"""I can't stick night raids,"" said one of our number. ""They don't put my"
"wind up a bit, but they interfere with my sleep and make me feel tired"
"in the mornings."""
A man who had been in the war from the beginning answered:
"""I can see you haven't been out here long, and have never been in a"
proper raid. I'll never forget the last time we were bombed. We were out
on rest about fifteen miles behind the line. Fritz came over and I had
the wind up so badly that I left the tent to go into the open fields.
"(I'd had a taste of it before, you know, and that makes all the"
difference.) Then he bombed us before I knew where I was. I ran for my
life. There was a hell of a crash behind me and a bit caught me in the
shoulder and knocked me down. When it was all over I got up and went
"back, although my shoulder hurt like anything. A lot of our fellows were"
"running about and shouting. Where my tent used to be, there was a big"
bomb-hole and my mates were lying dead all round--fourteen of them. I
"didn't recognize most of them, they were so smashed up. Fritz had"
dropped one right on the tent. I reckon I was lucky to get off with a
another without a word spoken. There was no sign of surprise or fear
"in his face, just a queer little smile. Suddenly he moved, made a"
"snatch at the front of his overalls, and put something into his mouth."
"I guessed what it was, but did not try to stop him; it was the best"
"thing that he could do."""
Dawson stopped and pulled savagely at his cigar. He jabbed the end
"with his knife, though the cigar was drawing perfectly well, and gave"
forth a deep growl which might have been a curse or a sob.
"""Have you ever watched an electric bulb fade away when the current is"
"failing?"" he asked. ""The film pales down from glowing white to dull"
"red, which gets fainter and fainter, little by little, till nothing"
but the memory of it lingers on your retina. His eyes went out exactly
"like that bulb. They faded and faded out of his face, which still kept"
"up that queer, twisted smile. I've seen them ever since; wherever I"
"turn. I shall be glad of that bout of influenza, and shall begin it"
with a stiff dose of veronal.... When the light had nearly gone out of
"his eyes and he was rocking on his feet, I spoke for the first time. I"
"spoke loud too. 'Good-bye,' I called out; 'I'm Dawson.' He heard me,"
for his eyes answered with a last flash; then they faded right out and
he fell flat on the steel deck. He had died on his feet; his will kept
"him upright to the end; that was a Man. He lived a Man's life, doing"
"what he thought his duty, and he died a Man's death.... I blew my"
whistle twice; up clattered a Sergeant with the Marine Guard and
stopped where that figure on the deck barred their way. 'Get a
"stretcher,' I said, 'and send for the doctor. But it won't be any use."
"The man's dead.' The Sergeant asked sharply for my report, and sent"
"off a couple of men for a stretcher. 'Excuse me, Sergeant,' I said, in"
"my best detective officer voice, 'I will report direct to your Major"
and the Commander. I am Chief Inspector Dawson.' He showed no surprise
"nor doubt of my word--if you want to understand discipline, gentlemen,"
We went down the fortress-stair to the eating-room. Here was a long
table with soup-plates upside down and a lamp burning an uncanny naked
"acetylene flame. We sat at the cold table, and the lamp immediately"
"began to wane. The room--in fact the whole of Sardinia--was stone cold,"
"stone, stone cold. Outside the earth was freezing. Inside there was no"
"thought of any sort of warmth: dungeon stone floors, dungeon stone walls"
"and a dead, corpse-like atmosphere, too heavy and icy to move."
"The lamp went quite out, and the q-b gave a cry. The brown woman poked"
her head through a hole in the wall. Beyond her we saw the flames of the
"cooking, and two devil-figures stirring the pots. The brown woman came"
and shook the lamp--it was like a stodgy porcelain mantelpiece
"vase--shook it well and stirred up its innards, and started it going"
"once more. Then she appeared with a bowl of smoking cabbage soup, in"
which were bits of macaroni: and would we have wine? I shuddered at the
"thought of death-cold red wine of the country, so asked what else there"
"was. There was malvagia--malvoisie, the same old malmsey that did for"
"the Duke of Clarence. So we had a pint of malvagia, and were comforted."
"At least we were being so, when the lamp went out again. The brown woman"
"came and shook and smacked it, and started it off again. But as if to"
"say ""Shan't for you"", it whipped out again."
"Then came the host with a candle and a pin, a large, genial Sicilian"
with pendulous mustaches. And he thoroughly pricked the wretch with the
"pin, shook it, and turned little screws. So up flared the flame. We were"
"a little nervous. He asked us where we came from, etc. And suddenly he"
"asked us, with an excited gleam, were we Socialists. Aha, he was going"
to hail us as citizens and comrades. He thought we were a pair of
Bolshevist agents: I could see it. And as such he was prepared to
"embrace us. But no, the q-b disclaimed the honor. I merely smiled and"
shook my head. It is a pity to rob people of their exciting illusions.
known the post-Renaissance Jesus. Which is rather an eye-opener.
"Not that they are suspicious or uneasy. On the contrary, noisy,"
"assertive, vigorous presences. But with none of that implicit belief"
"that everybody will be and ought to be good to them, which is the mark"
of our era. They don't expect people to be good to them: they don't want
"it. They remind me of half-wild dogs that will love and obey, but which"
won't be handled. They won't have their heads touched. And they won't be
fondled. One can almost hear the half-savage growl.
"The long stocking caps they wear as a sort of crest, as a lizard wears"
"his crest at mating time. They are always moving them, settling them on"
"their heads. One fat fellow, young, with sly brown eyes and a young"
"beard round his face folds his stocking-foot in three, so that it rises"
over his brow martial and handsome. The old boy brings his stocking-foot
over the left ear. A handsome fellow with a jaw of massive teeth pushes
his cap back and lets it hang a long way down his back. Then he shifts
"it forward over his nose, and makes it have two sticking-out points,"
"like fox-ears, above his temples. It is marvellous how much expression"
these caps can take on. They say that only those born to them can wear
"them. They seem to be just long bags, nearly a yard long, of black"
stockinette stuff.
The conductor comes to issue them their tickets. And they all take out
rolls of paper money. Even a little mothy rat of a man who sits opposite
me has quite a pad of ten-franc notes. Nobody seems short of a hundred
francs nowadays: nobody.
They shout and expostulate with the conductor. Full of coarse life they
"are: but so coarse! The handsome fellow has his sleeved waistcoat open,"
"and his shirt-breast has come unbuttoned. Not looking, it seems as if he"
"wears a black undervest. Then suddenly, one sees it is his own hair. He"
"little relieved, but drowsiness came on again. I fought against it with"
"all my strength, but with an agony no words can describe I realized that"
it was too strong for me. I pulled myself together with another
despairing effort. I noticed that my clothing felt cold and clammy--I
"had been sweating all over...."""
"The theatre orderly burst into the waiting-room and shouted: ""Are you"
"all deaf? I've been yelling out 'Next man' the last five minutes, but"
you won't take no bloody notice. Send us two or three. The Colonel's in
"the theatre--he'll kick up a hell of a row if you don't get a move on."""
"We were scared and sent three men across. When they had gone, we asked"
to hear the end of the story.
"""Well, I was absolutely desperate. I kept on looking at my watch, but"
"the minutes crawled along. I believe I must have started crying once,"
"but I don't know for certain, I was so sleepy that I don't remember half"
"of what I did and what I dreamt--I know I did dream, it's funny how you"
can start dreaming even when you're standing up or moving about. I
couldn't keep my eyes open and I kept on dropping off and pulling myself
"together. Suddenly, there was a terrific crash and a shell burst, it"
"must have been forty or fifty yards off. I thought, bitterly, that"
"there'd be no Blighty for me--no such luck. Then, high up in the air, I"
"saw a big shell-fragment sailing along in a wide curve, spinning and"
"turning. I looked at it--it was coming my way--Jesus Christ, perhaps I'd"
have some luck after all--and in any case a few more seconds would have
"passed by. It descended like a flash, I started back in spite of myself"
and held one hand out in front of my face. I felt a kind of numb pain in
"my right foot--nothing very bad. I looked down and, oh joy, I saw a big,"
"jagged bit of shell imbedded in my foot. I tried to move it, but the"
"pain was too great. Joy seemed to catch me by the throat, I began to"
"dance, but such a pang shot through my leg that I had to stop. I dropped"
"dipped in a lock of his hair, and it came out like pure gold, and fairly"
shimmered.
"Then the king's son said: ""Better and better! But if he cooks gold here,"
"I wonder what he cooks inside, there?"" And he wanted to see, so he went"
into the fourth room. Here there was no kettle to be seen; but a maiden
sat on a bench who must have been a king's daughter; yet whatever she
"might be, the king's son had never seen any one so beautiful in all his"
"days. ""Now in heaven's name, what are you doing here?"" asked the maiden."
"""I hired myself out here yesterday,"" said the king's son. ""May God be"
"your aid, for it is a fine service you have chosen!"" said she. ""O, the"
"master is very friendly,"" said the king's son. ""He has given me no hard"
"work to do to-day. When I have cleaned out the stable, I need do nothing"
"more."" ""Yes, but how are you going to manage it?"" she went on. ""If you"
"do as the others have done, then for every shovelful you pitch out, ten"
fresh shovelfuls will fly in. But I'll tell you how to go about it. You
"must turn around the shovel, and work with the handle, then everything"
"will fly out by itself."""
"This he would do, said the king's son; and he sat there with her all day"
"long, for they had soon agreed that they would marry, he and the king's"
"daughter, and in this way his first day in the giant's service did not"
"weary him at all. When evening came on, she told him that now he must"
"clean out the stable before the giant came, and when he got there he"
"thought he would try out her advice, and began to use the shovel as he"
"had seen his father's grooms use it. And sure enough, he had to stop"
"quickly, for after he had worked a little while, he hardly had room in"
"which to stand. Then he did as the king's daughter had told him, turned"
the shovel around and used the handle. And in a wink the stable was as
clean as though it had been scrubbed. When he had finished he went
"to the room that the giant had assigned him, and walked up and down,"
"whistling and singing. Then the giant came home with his goats. ""Have"
"""We must take the rough and the smooth of life as we find it,"" answered"
"the other.  ""I have had my moments of rebellion—I have them still; but I"
seek the consolations of philosophy; and I have never yet wanted for
bread or shelter.  But there be times when the future looks dark before
"me.  Those who remember me, and pity my misfortunes, drop away one by"
one.  I lacked not for patrons at the first. When I could not longer
"tread the boards, I was ofttimes engaged to make men laugh or weep at"
"some gay rout at a nobleman’s house.  Then, too, my jests and quips were"
"in request at gay supper-parties, and I was paid to set the table in a"
"roar, which in all sooth was not difficult when the wine-bottle was"
"going round and round.  Oh, I knew gay times for many a year after my"
stage career closed. But patrons have died off one by one.  I am more
"crippled than I was, and the young wits are pushing to the front, whilst"
the Old Lion has been crowded out.  My pen still serves me in a measure.
"I can turn an epigram, or write a couplet, or even make shift to pen a"
"sonnet that lacks not the true ring.  Grist yet comes to the mill, but"
more and more slowly.  There come moments when I wonder what will be the
"end of the Old Lion’s career—the poorhouse, or a death by slow"
"starvation in some garret!"""
"""No, no,"" cried Grey almost fiercely; ""that would be shame indeed."
"Surely, if nothing better turn up, there must be places of refuge for"
"fallen genius. Have not almshouses been built, again and again, by the"
"well-disposed for such men as sickness has laid aside?  You smile, but"
"in sooth it is so."""
"""Ay, and how many are there to claim the benefits of pious founders?"
"Yet no matter.  I brought you not here to talk of my troubles, but of"
"yours.  That romance of which you speak—"""
"""It would seem the world cares little for such things.  I did hear the"
"same tale everywhere.  Was it a pamphlet I had to give them, a lampoon"
"killed in an accident, and that was some consolation to me. And the next"
morning--I can't bear to think of it--nothing happened: that was just
the terrible thing about it--nothing happened. The day passed and then
"another day. At times I longed to be taken out and shot, and once or"
twice I felt I didn't care about anything. I didn't care whether I died
or not. A week passed and then another week. I don't know how I lived
"through it. Then, one day, I was told to pack up and rejoin my unit. I"
"don't know exactly what I did, but I think I must have gone hysterical."
I remember some N.C.O. saying I ought to stay a bit because I wasn't
well enough to go up the line. He said he'd speak to the officer and get
me a few days' rest. But the thought of staying in that place made me
shiver. I said I was absolutely all right and went back to my unit.
"""But I never found out what had happened--you see, I was only a common"
"soldier, so they didn't trouble to tell me--until I got a letter from"
the Captain who was in charge of me when I was on that forty-three hour
job. He said he'd heard I was in for a court martial for sleeping when
"on guard, so he wrote to our headquarters to tell them I'd worked"
forty-three hours on end and wasn't fit to do a guard after a spell like
that. Then they must have made a lot of inquiries--I expect there's a
"whole file of papers about me at headquarters. Anyhow, that's how I got"
"off--it's more than a month ago now. Well, yesterday morning I was put"
"on guard again. I tried to get out of it, but the officer said I was"
swinging the lead and he wouldn't listen to any excuses. I told him I'd
had insomnia overnight and could hardly keep my eyes open. I said I'd do
"anything rather than a guard--a fatigue job or a patrol, no matter how"
"dangerous, as long as it kept me on the move. The very thought of doing"
a guard made me tremble all over. He swore at me and said he'd heard
"these tales before and told me to shut up and get on with it. Well, I"
had to stand in the trench in front of a steel plate with holes in it
through which I had to peer. It was just about daybreak. There was a
tree growing about fifty yards off. It had been knocked about pretty

I got 40.
Can I get 41?
Forty once.
Forty twice.
Sold to the gentleman for $40.
"All right, we come now to the next number, 42-399."
- [Speaking French]
Are you sorry for--?
Are you sorry for having offended God and for all the sins of your past life?
-Where do you want this?
-What?
Phonograph.
Storage.
That's everything.
I'm gonna miss you.
Same here.
Sure you won't change your mind?
I found this in her room.
You better hurry.
"Come on, honey, we have to get going."
She doesn't remember any of it.
That's good.
-All done.
-Okay.
"Honey, this is Father Dyer."
"-Hi, Father."
-Hello.
"Ready, missus."
"-Goodbye, Father."
-Goodbye.
I'll call you.
Bye.
"-Bye, Father."
-I hope I see you again.
I hope so too.
Father Dyer?
I thought you'd like to keep this.
Why don't you keep it?
Lieutenant.
"Marin, Claire, Lisa..."
Come visit me in Korea.
Definitely.
Promise.
Promise!
Do you eat spicy food?
Yeah.
Really?
"Let me guess, was it your sister?"
My sister's a por...
It was my girlfriend.
The phone.
Front desk speaking.
What?
No hot water in the bath?
"I'm sorry, we'll send someone right away."
Excuse me?
"Oh, sure, we'll bring one."
Sorry about that.
Room 311 has no hot water in the bath.
Room 311?
"Hurry, go."
You go instead.
"It's your job to deal with customer complaints, no?"
"Please, go for me."
And you call yourself a man?
"Wait, take a condom."
The room was missing one.
No hot water?
Asshole.
"Ow, what the hell?"
Why aren't you angry?
Find a way to stall that wedding!
Stall the wedding.
W-What am I?
What?
That's it!
Move it!
Let's go!
We got an emergency here.
Dearly beloved--
"Don't worry, Ariel."
We-We're gonna make it.
We're-- We're almost there.
"Yes, um, do you, Eric, take Vanessa... to be your lawfully wedded wife... for as long as you both shall live?"
I do.
It being-- And do you--
Oh!
Then by the power--
"Get away from me, you slimy little--"
"Oh, why, you little--"
Huh?
Ahh.
Huh?
- Ariel?
- Eric!
You-
- You can talk?
- You're the one.
"- Eric, get away from her."
- It-It was you all the time.
"- Oh, Eric, I-I wanted to tell you."
"Eric, no!"
You're too late!
"And I feel sorry for you, Dean."
"You feel sorry for me, huh?"
Don't feel sorry for me.
You don't know anything about me.
I save lives.
I'm a hero.
A hero!
What?
"Way to go, Sam."
"Good job, buddy."
"Damn, nice job, Winchester."
Sam!
Great job!
"- Nice, Sam."
- Sam the man.
"Hey, Sam, good job, man."
Dad?
Finally.
I can't wait to get the hell out of here.
This place sucks.
"Come on, Sam."
Mr. Wyatt?
Yes.
You probably don't remember me.
"But my name is Sam Winchester, and..."
I just wanted to thank you.
For?
"I was a student here, and you gave me some advice once."
"Winchester, right."
Right.
Yeah.
"You, uh -- You wrote that horror story."
"Did she tell you, Hugh?"
My horse died.
Pie-O-My?
That's too bad.
"-God, this wine."
-There was a fire at the stables.
She had to be destroyed.
You should've seen her.
"String beans, Hugh?"
"-Baby, what happened?"
-He got jacked by some spics.
"-They took his ride, his fucking watch,too."
"-Jesus Christ, the Cartier?"
"-Christopher, you're bleeding."
-Stop touching it.
-Do you think I could get some money?
-What?
-Who are you?
-Eddie.
-From down the park.
"-He's good people, Adriana."
I took him home.
"He was all fucked up, but I straightened him out."
He owes me $30.
-Get the fuck out of here.
-What?
Get out of my house.
"-Don't stiff me on this, man."
-Get out!
What's the matter with you?
The guy's my friend.
That's your friend?
[ Piano Continues ]
How you doin'?
"Oh, fine, thank you."
You Tickler?
"Yes, sir."
"Well, Rick sent me."
He said you used to work the Wiki-Wiki Club on Hotel Street during the war.
[ Chuckles ] Sure did.
Great club.
Lot of action.
Lot of fun.
Lines for everything.
Even to hear my music.
Times sure have changed.
- She work there?
- [ Tickler ] Oh.
Pretty lady.
Yeah.
You remember her?
"You know, her face does look kind of familiar."
Her name's Diane Westmore.
Yeah.
Diane.
Nice girl.
I remember when she died.
Lot of people cried.
She died?
That's right.
During the war.
The big one.
"In a car accident with some flyboy from Wheeler, I think."
- You sure it was Diane Westmore?
YOU'RE SO TALL.
WHAT IS THIS?
LET ME HAVE A LOOK AT YOU.
LET ME SEE.
"OH NO, PRAMOD."
YOU'RE TALLER THAN ME.
"WHAT IS THIS, PRAMOD?"
WHAT IS THIS?
WHAT IS THIS?
AND YOU GOT NEW GOALS AND EVERYTHING.
- ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THAT?
- YES.
- MISSED ME?
- MUCH.
"PRAMOD, I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT SOMETHING."
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER RIGHT AWAY
BECAUSE I'M STAYING HERE ALL WEEK.
- OKAY?
- YES.
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME AND LIVE WITH ME
IN DENMARK?
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T THINK SO.
"BUT YOU KNOW, WE CAN COME AND VISIT"
AS MUCH AS WE WANT TO.
BUT I WANT TO STAY HERE.
EVERYTHING IS SO GOOD HERE NOW.
I DON'T WANT TO LIVE THERE.
YOU DON'T LIKE PEOPLE THERE.
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF.
"YES, BUT YOU--"
"BUT THEN WE WON'T SEE EACH OTHER, PRAMOD."
-Shut up!
Shut up!
-Why the fuck did you do this?
-I'm sorry.
Stay back!
210.
"210, A-1 channel 1."
"Come in, goddamn it."
Hurry up.
"Hurricane, where the hell have you been?"
I need help out here.
What's your 10-20?
"Oh, God."
"Dale, what's your 20?"
Where are you?
"I'm off the highway, two miles down Sulphur Springs road."
There's a house.
"In the woods, there's this house--"
Is there an address?
I don't know the goddamn address.
Just send some help.
And an ambulance.
I got three suspects down and I'm hurtpretty bad.
-Three suspects down.
-You know Sulphur Springs Road?
"Hold on, Byron."
"Charlie, do something."
"Dud, come on!"
Charlie's taking care of it.
Come on!
That son of a bitch nailed them.
"Hey, man."
Put your gun down.
It's all good.
(MAN MOANS)
"Hey, hey, hey, hey- People, people."
Chill out.
Calm down.
"Now I've shared something with you,"
I need you to share something with me.
Where's Akan going?
Mmm.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
"Oh, Shit, shit."
(SCREAMING IN PAIN) Now that is my ego talking to yours.
(MAN SOBBING)
What do you want?
"Higher self, ego?"
"Higher self, ego?"
Higher self!
Higher self.
Yeah.
Okay.
Akan's convoy are taking the girl to his base.

"Ah, shit."
Let me handle this.

- But he said...
"- I said, pay him off!"
I don't like anybody to welsh!
"Let me give you a hand, Stoke!"
"You can still punch, Stoke!"
"I told you, you could take him!"
"Thanks, Bat!"
"Come on, take a deep breath!"
Take a deep breath!
"Come on, snap out of it, Nelson!"
"Come on, Nelson!"
I will see you later.
Okay?
See you.
"So Gul, tell me."
What else do you do to wind out?
"I mean, I really like the person.."
Wow!
Beautiful.
Excellent.
Fantastic.
That's really nice.
Adi.
Wonderful!
Wonderful!
Did you make this?
- No.
Gul has made it.
You were saying she doesn't know anything.
She knows many things.
Okay.
"- Actually, I was wrong about her talent."
Rectify your mistake.
She should be promoted.
Where is she?
Where is Gul?
"She was toiling the whole night, sir."
She is sleeping.
"Hey, Pia."
- Hey.
"Hey, Gul."
Where were you the whole night?
Don't ask.
"All right, all right!"
"One, two, three, four..."
"All right, get back."
Nobody touch that dog.
"five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, one, two-"
Dog is gonna draw a sled.
Just stand there.
The dog will do it!
It's plenty load for one dog to pull.
The dog will do it!
"Five, six, seven, eight, nine-"
"Keep your hands off that dog, now!"
You understand?
"Oh, I beg your pardon."
"Seven, eight, nine, a hundred."
"Go on, mister."
We're waiting.
Buck.

"Come on, boy!"
"Come on, Buck!"

"Come on, whitey!"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
- Dick Simmons.
- He's right down the hall here.
- Wh-Why is he here?
Some thug broke into his house.
Broke his legs with a bat.
"Officer, please."
- Boom.
- Was it
- Was it Dale the thug?
"Well, i don't know."
Some jerk with a plaid shirt.
But don't worry.
[ Imitating Gunfire ]
I killed him.
"Oh, jeez, that's just..."
- Come on.
Thank you.
- [ Crowd Clamoring ]
"Back, back, back, back!"
- Scoot!
Scoot!
- Yes!
[ Stifled Chuckling ] I can't stand it.
Yes!
[Loud Clattering]
What?
[ Blubbering ]
"Dick, I'm back."
This is the lightning round.
I'm calling the shots now.
"- Quiet, I'm trying to ski."
"- Look, I got your money."
LILA:
"It's time for you to go home and go to bed, okay?"
BYRON:
Okay.
LILA:
"I love you, honey."
You going to be a good boy?
BYRON:
Yeah.
Give me a kiss good-bye.
RONNIE:
"Come on, Lila."
BYRON:
Goodbye.
"Take care of my baby, okay?"
You going to be all right?
"Yeah, I'm all right."
"Ronnie, put the money in the bank, okay?"
Ronnie?
"Put the money in the bank, okay?"
(WATER RUNNING)
Lila?
Dale.
"How you doing, baby?"
Stop right there.
Turn around.
Turn around.
Put your hands on the counter where I can see them.
And spread your legs.
Simon says.
Can I turn around now?
Why don't you just stay like that?
Where are the plans?
- Mr. Wooster has them.
- Wooster?
Who's he?
A friend of mine.
"Well, where is he?"
"- Oh, he's gone!"
- Gone?
"Yes, he was downstairs— or maybe they've killed him."
Come on.
You two go on out.
Come on.
Mr. Wooster!
Mr. Wooster!

Most extraordinary.
He was here a moment ago.
"Oh, there you are."
"Here he is, miss."
Bertie!
"Bertie, are you hurt?"
"Marjorie, I was just having the most beautiful dream about you."
"Oh, this is my cousin, Mr. McDermott, the inventor."
- How do you do?
"Jeeves, shake hands for me."
"- Yes, sir."
Manville was going to try and get the plans of his invention.
He was going to sell them to a foreign government.
You don't know?
[raucous laughter]
"Robin, you're crazy!"
I like this girl.
Normal.
Everything's normal.
Ahh!
Is this the new futon?
"- Yes, it is, in fact."
"- Yeah, yeah."
We just bought it together.
It's my new favorite thing.
And... and you know it turns into a bed?
"So really, it's like two things."
A couch that turns into a bed?
"Yeah, I'll believe it when I see it."
"Yeah, right?"
"All right, watch this."
"Oh, oh, oh, okay."
- Okay.
"- All right, ready?"
- All right.
- Okay?
- On three.
- Yep.

"Two, three!"
[all cheering]
- Very nice!
- Okay.
"[Caveman's ""Never Going Back""]"
"Now, is fine."
Was that one of our aircraft?
"Yes, it just flew over."
Has it crashed?
-The crew taken prisoner.
"Okay, we'll go right away."
Let's go men.
Thank you.
Catherine.
"Say 'good day', my love."

Ah!
Where...where is she?
Thank you!
Cut.
Could someone please get Mr.Hilliard out of Dunkirk?
"Find Mrs.Cole. Train ticket, Ration card, authorization to travel."
Oh!
Don't be nervous.
Mr.Hilliard won't notice you're gone.
It's not Mr.Hilliard. It's Ellis.
He's going to be so disappointed in me.
For missing' the opening.
For not turnin' up to the last minute.
Nonsense!
Here they come!
"Rule number two, no blood suckers on my boat!"

Ladies and gentlemen.
"To celebrate the opening of the club, we've invited Huang Fei-hung to perform a lion dance with his students."
Great!
"Master, is this an easy one?"
No!
You'll hurt yourself if not careful.
What does it call?
The Gold and Silver Rosette!
You'll have to cross the bridge first.

Roll the drum!
Go!

"Hey, come out here!"
Come on!

"David, leave Rosie alone!"
She scared the hell out of me.
She's just a cat.
"David, come inside."
So who's out here?
"Huh, Jess?"
Don't start that again.
Wait!
You're not gonna answer me?
I don't know!
What!

I deserve death!
Where are they?
Go tear down the winery!
"Bring Chang Seventh in, dead or alive!"
Right!
"Hello, Brother Chin!"
You have some more orders?

They finally gave my two moms one name.
"But by then, Dad was already done."
"Andi was the one left there to keep her secret, to keep her safe."
And I did.
A pocketful of posies
And sometimes it was great.
We all fall down
- You should get one too.

"Oh, you're the best baby girl that ever lived."
"Hi, honey."
"Hi, sweetums."
"Oh, God."
"Hi, hi, hi."

"- Oh, nothing."
- We are...
- Surprise!
"Oh, my God."
- Two words:
Ryan Gosling.

What do you think?
Your mom had lunch with Ryan Gosling.
I think he's a little strange-looking.
"- Come on, get in the car."
- I don't think this is a good idea.
[Repeats German word]
Oh!
"Oh, he does... he does like music."
He just prefers the violin.
- Ja.
Ja.
- Ja.
"Oh, dear."
What a pity we don't have a gramophone.

"- Well, they're frightfully expensive."
Adam Penruddocke plays the violin.
Does he?
I believe so.
Wipe your feet.
[Feet wiping]
All right.
Just a minute.
Lift them up.
And the other one.
All right.
[Janet]:
"Oh, Adam."
How good of you to come.
Our guest has expressed a desire to hear some music on the violin.
All right.
Andrea.
This is Adam Penruddocke.
[Speaking German]
Oh.
You've come to play for him.
Perhaps you better sit down.
"Hey, girl."
I thought you were going to Star City.
"I am, tonight."
"You bad 'cause you got a camera, huh?"
"Come on, show us."
You're messing up my picture with your lousy dancing.

Is Ray with you?
No.
That's good.
That's real good.
You know you're always welcome here.
Bobby's about to blow out the candles on his birthday cake.
"How old are you, 60?"
"That's your IQ, woman."
"Oh, no, Bobby."
"Hey, this is Darren and Danielle."
Hey.

That's it?
"That's the air coming out, right?"

I don't know.
The gas...
We must've been hit at the checkpoint.
Under that tree.
"Pull up to that side, pull over."
Okay.
That's good.
"Just keep looking into my eyes, Dad."
This fellow...
"Hello, Sir."

"I am chasing an accused in high speed, Sir!"
I'll talk later.
I can't even catch such a slow-runner!
I...

Will you keep breaking rules just because you are a cop?
You are always interfering a responsible cop on duty!
Get lost!

I said leave me!
Why are you after me?
What do you want?
"Sir, leave me!"
"Leave me, Sir!"
What wrong did I do?

Give me the phone!
- Hey...
Unlock it!

"Goodbye, but I hope we don't meet again."
But that's the other one!
- It's not him.
And then?
- What about the bail?
"Counselor, it's not fair!"
- This is a mistake!
"One moment, stop!"
You arrest me again?
"- Come on, come on!"
Why did I have to..
"- Come on, no stories!"
- I was freed!
They're bringing me back to jail?
- Calm down or else.
"I must leave, I'm an honest man!"
"- Yeah, right."
How is this possible?
- Goddamn you!
"Wanted to cheat me again, huh?"
Get inside!
Got it?
Here's the walking papers.
OK.
Goodbye.

"Burger, fries, Coke and a lemon pudding."
I'll take these.
The mayor's boy gets the lemon pudding.

He's in the back.
That's the only way in.
The back door's gated.
All right.
I got a couple marriages.
Abe.
It's your play.
Throw the card for me.
You've been practicing all your life.
"Freddie, give us a minute."
He's dead!

"A woman was standing there, and you vomit -vomited on her."

"Where would you like to go, Dad?"
Hi.
[Kisses]
Hello.
"Hello, Joe."

With me?
You are with me.

"Uh, maybe..."
"uh, ye... no, ye... ahh...!"
Mm.
I like this one.
Ugh!
"You think you do, but you don't."
What do I think of this wine?
Great question.
Here's what you think.
"Hey, Ethan."
How's Rudy?
How's Beanbag?
"Uh, they're great."
Beanbag's great.
Rudy's such a delight.
I just dropped off some juice for them.
Can I get a cranberry juice?
Uh-oh...
Coming right up.
"Um, who's Rudy?"
- He's my son.
- You have a son?
"Mandy, you know, I might have left a little information off my E-Kiss profile, but that was just for readability."
"So, you look nothing like your profile picture and you have a son?"
Uh-huh.
Okay.
"So, your face is saying one thing..."
No.
No.
I love kids.
Okay.
I just have no idea what element goes there.
"Okay, Michelangelo, but we have to close our eyes to match the photo."
So you're the timekeeper.
Well- (SCOFFS)
"Yeah, dude, it's 7:59."
Just go ahead.
"Well, how long do we do it for?"
"10, 15 seconds?"
I'll tell you when to stop.
Just go.
(EXHALES)
I'll be thinking about my boyfriend.
Sweet.
Threesome.
"(SCOFFS) Come here, asshole."
(GASPS) Oh!
Of course.
"Oh, geez, did you guys-"
Hey!
(GASPS)
(DOOR SLAMS) Shit.

I just wanted to- Go get Jasper!
"- Finn, I'm sorry."

The guy you're always talking on the phone to?
What is he doing in the apartment?
- I don't know.

Cheng Tachwan?
(dramatic music)
"Sir, these men."
Are you Cheng Tachwan?
"Sure, what is it?"
A search.
A search?
What's wrong?
Search.
"[Guard] Hey kiddo, you got a visitor."
Lun Taichen.
Go get some money.
Go into town quickly.
Do something to get me out of this place.
I'm innocent.
"Boss, selling drugs is serious, it's hard to fix."
What's more...
You see?
You are completely broke.
"In fact, you owe over $4,000."
You!
(laughing)
"You, you, son of a bitch!"
"Lun Taichen, you're a bastard."
You betrayed me!
"Madame, won't you?"
(laughing)
(plate crashing)
Really?
Cheng Tachwan was my father.
"I was young then, studying in Tensen."
And now.
It's Hendrix!
Ah!
No!
No!
I gotta get outta here!
"Hey, have you seen the Sheriff?"
Oh!
"Oh, my gosh."

I just need my daily gas ration from the Sheriff.
Wait for him at Flo's.
Get outta here.
I've been trying to get outta here for three days!
Hope you enjoyed the show!
"Whoa, Doc."
"Time to clean out the garage, buddy, come on."

He has a Piston Cup?
"Oh, my gosh."
Three Piston Cups?
Sign says stay out.
You have three Piston Cups.
How could you have...
I knew you couldn't drive.
I didn't know you couldn't read.
- You're the Hudson Hornet!
"- Wait at Flo's, like I told ya!"
Of course.
I can't believe I didn't see it before.
You're The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!
You used to hold the record for most wins in a season.
Anton is like totally gay.
"Harold, what are you doing here?"
I didn't want to wait ten days to see you... so I thought I would come and surprise you.
That is so sweet.
OK.
It's sweet.
I've been thinking about you this whole time.
- You have?
- I have.

I was so swollen.
I hated Detroit.
"- Isiah, Laimbeer."

Dumars.
"Oh, my..."
"But Worthy, James Worthy, he saved us."
He shot the lights out.
So fantastic.
You know that thing I was trying to talk to you about?
- Jimmy.
"- No, I'm just saying that I took care of it."
- I knew you would.
- You did?
I can't believe I'm old enough to have watched people play in those shorts.
"Hey, Marissa."
Marissa?

Here you go.
Hey.

What's the matter?
Come on.

"My darling, I couldn't die without saying,"
"""The cornflower blow in your eyes the final time."" You can have that on me."
What's his name?
The boyfriend.
Eric.
Eric Lum.
Do you hear that noise?
That's 200 women in 1 in 9 never allowed to call their sons anything as bloody feeble as Eric.
Give me hero's name?
Jon.
Dull.
Johnnie.
Hm..hmm.
They left him to make it back.
Injured.
Oh!

A rescue!
"Don't be a fool, Johnnie."
There's a sniper out there!

Jesus Christ.
Are you okay?
–What?
–Vic got shot.
–What?
–Vic got shot.
–Can we leave?
–Shouldn't be much longer.
"Oh, please."
Don't walk out on me again.
Just please don't leave me alone.
"Look, um..."
I believe you.
Maybe Bob did this without you knowing.
I was with him all night.
"If I thought he did this, I would tell you."
"And now, the situation in portugal -"
"Nice, huh?"
"What,s wrong?"
"- I,m afraid."
Why?
What is it?
"I don,t know."
"Sweetie pie, what,s wrong?"
Are you okay?
This is science.
"It,s not -"
"I don,t know."
That woman -
Have you seen my pills?
"Aren,t they on the table?"
"You know, I really feel awful."
What are they doing?

"We,re creating this city for you."
To make you happy.
"Be happy, but not too happy."
"Too happy and you,d have nothing to wish for."
"- What,s this crap?"
Think I just fell in love.
So we're friends.
Yeah.
You wanna come in?
"I'm sorry, I don't trust myself."
That's okay.
You can just watch.
"You know, you may be the best friend I've ever had."

Hi.

[BEN LAUGHS]
Sort of an odd thing to say.
"You know, maybe it was the ashtray and cigarettes I found."
In the back yard.
"What part of ""My dad died of lung cancer"" is so hard for you to wrap your brain around?"
What?
"Do not lie to me, Ben."
"Please, okay?"
Are you serious?
Like when you shut it off.

Where's your diver?

Shot in the heart.
Small caliber.

She's been dead 48 though.
Somebody held on to her a while.

- Nothing much.
You know Danny.
- How are the treating you at work?
- Good.
I read that Rossmore is retiring.
Are you gonna be the next chief?
"Not me, kid."
I'm just a Larimer Avenue dego.
I'll revive the whole thing right.
"Now, watch-- here."
"That was the beach, right?"

"All right, this was zero hour."
This is the way it went.
Everybody in posi...
"Gunther, in position?"
"-Right, sir."
-All right.
What are you doing there?
You're with the artillery.
"-Get over there, Tubby!"
"-All right, all right."
"Morgan, get behind the foxhole."
"Zeke, you got the bazookas ready?"
"-All set, all set."
-Now... wait a minute.
Then there came that air...

[Seagulls screeching]
Janet?
- Janet!
-Hmm?
The sun is out again.
[Janet groans]
"[Sighs] Oh, good."
Oh.
It's so gorgeous.
Everything smells so fresh after the storm.
We seem to have escaped relatively unscathed.
"Oh, the buddleia's knocked about a bit, though."
The tide was quite high last night.
Yes.
What's that?
"Janet, quick, come here."
What's that?
At the end of the beach.
That black thing?
- I can't see it.
- There ... there.
Oh.
"Oh, dear."
I think it's a body.
I'll telephone Pendered.
[Ursula]:
Where do you think he's gone?
I don't know.
DEE DEE:
Get your ass out here.
-Dee Dee?
-Remember me?
Detective Kelly.
"-Yeah. I remember you, detective."
KELLY:
Come here.
-Should I call Detective Roberts at home?
-You know this isn't cool.
"-Maybe Connie, his wife, will answer."
-You gotta do me a really big favor.
-What's that?
Mike promised to get me money.
I can't get in touch with him--
-That's not how this works.
"-But if I could borrow $20, I promise- l will give him your message."
-l gotta get up. I don't have any money.
-l'm gonna give him your message.
-No.
"No, no, no."
That's not good.
You think I'm only his snitch?
You think that's what I am?
I'm not.
I'm his round-the-world girl.
I'm his whore.
-What the hell's going on?
-You got a visitor.
"Hi, Mike."
-You're not supposed to be in here.

"No, she."
"Ali, surrounded by children."
-That is your wife?
-Yes.
Really?
-Yes.
-Your wife?
"Yes, take the fish."

She deserves the best.

"So, what have you been doing?"
"Nothing much, just hanging out, in the park mostly."

It's cooler.
It's where David Lee Roth got busted.
Right.
I hope he's got it together now.
Sounds like you got a party going on there.

- ...and Goldie's actually letting me do a rewrite of one of the sketches.
"Oh, wow."
Congratulations.
"Thank you, so it's just-- man, it's just-- it's really bad timing for me right now."
"Timing, right."
So...

Of course.
[laughs]
"Yeah, yeah."
"- Okay, good."
"- Yeah, friends."
"- I'll see you later, friend."
- All right.
Oof.

"No, you are."
Is that all you can think of?
"No, I couId say..."
"I,ve had enough."
You go out.
"You see people and have fun, while I,m stuck here alone."
Then you come home and get waited on.
Are you kidding now?
"Sure, I laugh all day long."
"And you cry too, right?"
What would you know?
"All right, get up."
"I'm awfully sorry, sir."
I made the mistake.
I press this button.
Same mistake.

Give me a smile.
Almost done.
Almost there.
Ready.

Do you want to die?
How dare you bother Brother Koon!
"Lucky you're with Sifu Tam, or I'd have broken your hands!"
"Get lost, now!"
Go!

Molecular flow reversing.

It would have to be one of my people.
- There are more like you?

"When you find her, explore her body with your hands."
Describe what you feel.
Be honest.
I got the feeling she was hiding.
"It,s her all right."
Good.
"Jean-MicheI, take one step forward and fall backward into CIaudine,s arms."
Go.
Very good.
Take off his blindfold.
How do you feel?

"Hey, Rufus."
It's Serena.
Hi.
Is your mom there?
Um...
"Yeah, she-she's here."
She's just really tired right now.
I'll let her know you called.
They say that family are
The people who will always take you in.
"But what if instead, they shut the door?"
I was just telling mom about my date with Elliot.
We had a great time.
Thank you.
"Oh, who was that?"
"Oh, it was just Blair."
"Or even worse, let someone else take your place?"
"What do you say, Serena?"

I'm ok.

That's great to hear.
We're on soon.
"Um, Lou just pulled up."
Punctual as always.
"A little help, here!"
That's mine.
This is so sad.
Really sad.
You're right.
It's... sad.

"No, you can't."
But I am a grandfather.

"Yes, I am."
I have two grandchildren from Christine's sister.

"Listen, Miss Betts."
"You're new, right?"
"Yes, I'm new here, but I'm not new on the job."
- I was...

-Should keep you going for a while.
"-God, fancy you remembering that?"
Ysatis.
"Thank you, Alice."
Isn't that sweet of you?
-I'd love a lager.
Thank you very much indeed.
-Great.
"Excuse me a sec, will you."
Natalie!
"Now look what you've done, you messy little girl."
"That's not nice, is it?"
On your Uncle Steve.
-It's fine.
-I'm so sorry.
STEPHEN:
No idea she was going to put as much on.
Don't worry.
I'm sure it'll come off with some Vanish.
"Oh, dear."
Yes.
"Actually, Alice, you think we could have a quiet word somewhere?"
"Only, er, I've got a bit of a problem."
IRENE:
Hey.
BOB:
Surprise.
"Hi, how you guys doing?"
GIL:
Getting a little exercise out there.
IRENE:
Yeah.
I think that's enough excitement for today.
"Thank you, Adam."
It's so kind of you.
This way.
Mind your head.

I've got a job for you.
You put the peel in here and the spuds in here.
"You have done this before, haven't you?"
No.
You put the peel in here and the spuds in here.
"""Spuds""?"
Yes.
"Proper name is potato, but we call them spuds."
Potato.
Potato!
Oh.

You're the only one there?
It must be terrible to be all alone.
"How do you manage to read the paper... drink the flowers, water the coffee... all by yourself?"
That's...
This can't be true.
Why did I fall asleep?
Don't worry.
Some joyrider will probably dump it somewhere.
"- Yeah, sure."
- What was in the car?
"Clothes, Christmas presents, all kinds of stuff."
I gotta go.
That guy must be on Valium or something.

Lost them.
Lost.
Please help me!
And your friends.
The blonde!
The dull!
Is this enough?
"-No, the debt is large."
-And you are very beautiful.
Now drop for the behind.
Here is the soap.
This is precisely what I wanted to say.
The dull and the blond... did so with the soap.
We'll see.
-FiIippo.
-My love?
When will we get back to play?
"Poor Filippo, lost in the game and also with his wife."
You think so?
"I, in contrast say that he has recovered."
-No reception for anyone!

I just wanted to do something different.
Yeah.
"Well, it's definitely different."

You don't like it?
"No, I like it."
I like it a lot.

"Hey, man!"
I got everything you want on that table over there.
There's 200 bucks in the wallet.
There's some coke in the kitchen.
Take the money and the coke.
You know what this is?
This is lighter fluid.
RAY:
"Fuck you, man."
I don't want no $200.
"Stop it, man."
"Put it out, man."
Put it out.
I'll tell you where the shit is.
(SCREAMING)
"Fuck you, man!"
Motherfucker.
"Oh, goddamn."
Goddamn.
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
Vegas.
I could leave Detroit.
Run things from out here.
Put a little space between Marcus and I.
What for?
Is he hurting you?
No.
Not yet.
It's complicated.
Alright.
Then what is Taylor asking for?
Four million.
It's a drop in the bucket for a guy like Marcus.
I think he wants me to fail.
Why?
I almost died in Berlin.
Blade.
I got burned.
I think Marcus lost faith in me.
All he needs is an excuse to replace me.
Then he's a goddamn fool.
Lisa?
Lisa.
I called the house but nobody's there.
Nobody's answering.
Is the nurse there?
Lisa?
You chill to the bone.
Do you wanna go to the hospital?
"Alright, alright..."
"Well, let me take you home."
I don't want to go back there.
I think the point is to make us despair.
To see ourselves as animal and ugly.
To reject the possibility that God could love us.
"Will you excuse me, Damien?"
"Dimmy, why do you do this to me?"
"Please, Dimmy."
I'm afraid.
You're not my mother.
"Dimmy, please!"
What is it?
Her heart.
Can you give her something?
She'll go into a coma.
You're not my mother!
Don't listen.
"Why, Dimmy?"
Damien!
"Dimmy, please!"
Get out.
You son of a bitch!
Take me!
"""Our Father..."
"""...who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name...."""
Is it over?
Is she going to die?
No.
Come in to me!
"Goddamn you, take me!"
Take me!
No!
Mother.
Mother.
Got it?
"- Well, yes, but..."
- But what?
Well...
"- Hello, Mac."
"- Am I breaking in on anything here, Jim?"
"No, not at all."
Come right in.
I want you to meet Rocky Sullivan.
"Pleased to meet you, Sullivan."
I know all about you.
You're okay.
- When did you get out?
- Couple days ago.
- What are you doing?
- Looking around.
- Maybe I might have a spot for you.
- We were just talking about that.
- Where you stopping?
"- A room at my old neighborhood on Dock Street, number 24."
"Well, I'll blow now."
"I'll drop up, say, Monday?"
- Monday?
That'll be fine.
- I'm going downtown.
I'll give you a lift.
- Thanks.
"- See you later, Jim."
Monday.
Get me Steve.
There's a fella leaving with Mac.
I want you to...
Find him and fix it.
"Yes, sir."
Consider it done.
Good morning.
How are you?
Good.
Excellent.
This is Allan Campbell.
"Hello, Allan."
Do you know who this is?
Uh...
No...
"You're forgetting me already, Allan?"
"Listen, you know, like I said, I'll..."
I'll get you the money.
It's just a matter of time.
"Well, that's great."
Can you do it today?
"No, no, no."
"Actually, I have a promotion today."
"And after that happens, then I got it all covered."
"The next time I see you, you better have my money."
"Yeah, no, I understand."
And I appreciate it.
Congrats on your career.
Thanks.
"Oh, shit."
Fuck.
Shit.
God damn it.
You all right?
Huh?
As a friend?
Please?

I don't remember much.
Banged my head on something.
There was...someone.
Where?
In the flat upstairs?
No.
"No, no, I can't be sure."
"Look, thank you, Miss Khan."
I'm really sorry to keep imposing on you.
"Let me call one of your colleagues, they can drive you back."
"No, no."
"I'm OK now, really."
What happened to her?
The girl upstairs.
You keep coming back.
You must think she...
Was she killed?
I can't rule that out.

Rags.
Prepare the kit.
Bridger!
You hold that.
(GRUNTING)
Easy.
"Oh, my God."
ANDERSON:
Got to give him credit for taking that grizz down with him.
He shouldn't have shot.
The place is crawling with tree niggers.
HENRY:
That's enough!
That's enough!
We're still in Ree territory.
He's one of our own men.
(CONTINUES WHEEZING)
Scout a circle around us.
North and west.

We have to stitch him up.

-Red wine.
-Okay.
-Now we can eat.
"-Some white, too."
Beautiful.
"Okay, boys, let's eat."
"Come on, Johnny, Vinnie."
Tomorrow we eat sandwiches.
"You got to go on a diet, Vinnie."
Read 'em and weep.
What are you doing?
"Alright, I'll catch you guys later."
"Yeah, you going for a walk in the park?"
I'll catch you next week.
Thanks.

"-Nope, that's it."
Have a good weekend.
Thanks Henry.
You girls stay right here.
-Hold hands.
-Go right up front.
What are you talking about?
I saw her name on the register.
Jesus Christ!
You want her to visit you?
Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
What am I doing here?
Where am I?
Now get in there.
Come on.
Enjoy yourself!
(LAUGHS)
"Call me son, yeah?"
"Hi, I'm Philip."
My name is Philip.
- Hello.
- WOMAN:
Hi.
"I know who you are, but it's a real pleasure."
- An old friend of Ike's.
- How do you know each other?
"Well, I've never met him personally, but, um..."
- You've heard of me.
- I've read.
I've read who I think you are.
- WOMAN:
Wow.
"- Yeah, he's... you know who he is, correct?"
"No, should we know who he is?"
"- Yeah, he's one of the..."
- I don't know whether you should...
- I...
I write.
- He's what they call essential.
- A writer.
- Like the profession.
"This guy is like, they teach this guy."
- You know...
"- Oh, really?"
"Yeah, I'm gonna just go check really quickly on the lord of the manor."
.
I'm going to go.
I don't really know anyone.
Maybe I'll see you there.
Bye.
- Don't leave me out here.
"- One drink, real quick."
What the hell is he doing here?
"Captain, he's here."
- Hi.
- Hi.
You look... different.
I'll take that as a compliment.
- I didn't think I'd see you here.
- Nobody did.
"Tommy, you made it."
"Good to see you, man."
"Come on, the whole family's right over here."
"- Dad, look who's here."
- He's got Tommy with him.
Let him go.
Don't keep them waiting.
"- Tommy, good to see you, son."
"- Hi, Uncle Fred."
- Introduce your date.
- She's not my date.
"This is my new partner, Jo Christman."
"Unfortunately, these are the Hardys."
My Uncle Fred.
- My cousin Gary.
- Don't fuck her.
"Tommy, you're too skinny."
- Thank you.
"Yeah, big boy!"
Mmm!
What... what are you watching?
!
Your girlfriend.
She is really talented.
Turn this off!
"Hey, turn it off!"
I cannot believe you!
That's the girl that
I am dating!
How could you do this?
You're a horrible friend!
Horrible!
"Aaron, 100,000 guys can watch Liza Blue online every day, but your roommate can't?"
You are a horrible friend!
Horrible!
That's not her name.
"Her name is Mary, okay?"
Mary!
"Okay, fine."
Mary!
"What are you going to do, man?"
Erase Mary from the entire Internet?
!
"Liza, it's Phillip."
No one can find you on the Internet.
"Your photos, your movies, your website... it's all blocked."
Only one lame ass thing comes up when I Google your name.
Ben?
What are you doing here?
- Grandma?
- I didn't know you.
"Ma'am, you can't just walk into our dressing rooms."
The showis underway.
"Please, get out."
- I'm Marcia's mother.
- What?
My apologies.
- I didn't know.
- Thank you.
"Darling, your mother never brought you for a visit."
I brought you some very tasty treats.
Here.
Do you like it?
It's all yours.
- All of it?
- All yours.
Your grandma will give you anything you want.
It's our turn.
Can you wait here?
Marcia will be right over to see you.
"Great, thanks."
"Hang tight, sweetie."
Mommy is on her way.
"The crowd is waiting, Barbuda!"
"There's more here, darling."
More?
"Yes, and it's all yours."
Do you like it?
Let's take a walk with grandma now.
What about mom?
Mommy is working.
Look behind you!
"The giant, it's attacking!"
It's stomping the town!
I was right!
- Sweet mother of God.
- MANSLEY:
"Look, damn you!"
(ENGINE ROARING)
I am not a gun.
"Hey, Mom."
(ROARS)
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
Let's get out of here!
Run!
(GASPS)
Hey.
Stop!
There's a kid in his hands!
Stop shooting!
Kent!
He only reacts defensively.
"If you don't shoot, he's harmless."
You gotta tell the General!
"This is all your fault, beatnik."
If you hadn't...
Would you shut up and listen?
You've gotta make them stop.
The giant's got the kid with him.
I'll take care of it.
He says the monster's killed a kid.
"Sir, we must stop it at all costs."
Go to code red.
Are you hurt?
Are you all right?
Painted Face is back!
I'm scared!
- Get rid of him!
- OK.
"Foon, it was a good idea to come back!"
She's back in my arms again.
"Old pal, let's impress her one more time."
Watch this!
- Are you OK?
"- Yeah, I just tripped."
"Foon, you're overacting."
Painted Face!
We're in trouble!
This is a different guy!
Help!
Help!
- I'm here!
- Let's go!
Come on!
- Faster!
- I'm spilling my wine!
"- Sifu Wong, are you abandoning me?"
- Aren't I holding you tight?
You've been holding my hand the whole night!
Are you crazy?
I'm going crazy!
I've been possessed by a demon!
Exorcism is my forte.
Where's the ghost?
Where's the ghost?
Cartridges?
"Certainly, sir."
Any particular make?
"No, as long as they've got gunpowder in them."
- What bore?
- Boar?
"No, no."
"A few rabbits, pheasants, small fry, you know."
"No, no, sir."
Bore.
B-O-R-E.
Bore!
(Laughs)
- Hmm?
"- 12, 20 or 4-10?"
Er...
"Definitely, yes."
"Well, which, sir?"
"Well, the largest you have, surely."
12-bore.
"How many, sir?"
50?
"No, I think you'd better make it a thousand."
- A thousand?
!
- Yes.
But didn't you say a day's rough shooting?
"Yes, I did, er..."
and it may be pretty rough.
"On second thoughts, I think you'd better make it 1,500, perhaps?"
Right.
"That's whisky, gin, sherry, tea, coffee, cocoa - all Mickey Finned."
Tony.
Tony?
Tony?
"Tony, why can't I get through to you?"
Tony?
"I'll pick up the new transistors, make a few stops."
Be back later on.
Don't worry.
Everything's under control.
Tony.
"This is Letha Wedge,"
Commanding you to open your eyes.
"Now, stand up."
We're going to the museum for education and profit.
Tony and I will do a little... sightseeing.
Wait.
Gold!
I see gold.
- Hey it's mine.
- Where is it?
"- Hey, give it to me!"
- No!
A stagecoach.
She must be tuned in on a western.
Yeah.
I see dummies.
That's you.
No.
Old things.
Clothing.
"Hey, he's at the salvation army."
"Nah, they don't got stagecoaches at the salvation army."
.
When do you think is she coming back?
-Wait a second.
-Oh sure!
-Just a minute.
"-Oh my, the foods are delicious!"
You should've tried everything!
When it gets cold it won't be as tasty anymore.
"You like that, right?"
.
Oh my!
I'm really excited for you.
You two can now make a family!
"Oh, don't mind me!"
I didn't see you in the church a while ago.
"It's just, I looked for you."
-My wife is so beautiful.
-You're really such a joker.
-But it's not that.
-Here you go again.
-Oh come on!
-Really!
So Joy...
Where are we?
"So, does it mean you're the only one who has surprises for me?"
.
Is that okay?
Is that okay?
.
Is that okay?
-It's beautiful!
-I told you!
But it's not yours to keep.
Great!
Really great.
And so began our summer with Tetra.
"He lived in my closet like an old friend, ...who'd been there for years."
"Hello, Misaki!"
Hello.
Is Yusuki home?
He's been in his room all morning ...just go on in.
Anybody home?
Whassup...
"How is he, Yusuki?"
I'm so sorry!
You gave me a fright.
Didn't you hear me?
Sorry.
"But boy, you scared me!"
My heart's thumping.
Stuff for Tetra.
Thanks.
Here's the aluminum.
How about this?
Let's ask Tetra!
Choose what you need.
He's so cute!
He likes that.
What's he making?
Dunno.
"But there's lots of parts, ...and he's real quick."
We interrupting?
Don't just barge in.
Your Mom said it was okay.
Oh.
"Oh, no."
Can this be evil?
Dr. Jekyll.
Dr. Jekyll?
"- What's happening, sir?"
Are you all right?
- What is it?
What do you want?
"Is that you, Dr. Jekyll?"
"Now, wait a minute."
"Wait a minute, Poole."
"Dr. Jekyll, who is that in there?"
"Dr. Jekyll, answer me, sir."
"Yes, Poole?"
"I'm sorry, sir, but I..."
I heard an odd noise and a strange voice.
"I thought something was happening, sir."
"No, no, no."
"It's quite all right, Poole."
There was someone here.
A friend of mine.
A Mr. Hyde.
I let him out the back door.
"Oh, I see, sir."
"Very good, sir."
"Miss Beatrix is here, sir."
"I showed her into the consulting room, sir."
"I hope I did right, sir."
"Yes, yes, that was quite right, Poole."
Tell Miss Beatrix I'll be there immediately.
"Very good, sir."
- He's in the next room.
- So the chocolate was for him?
- Mel...
- It was a retropharyngeal hematoma.
- What?
I snuck a look at his CT results.
- So he wasn't choked.
- No.
It happened earlier.
Probably from the fall.
I need to go.
My place after shift?
Sure.
Why not?
- I was getting worried.
- I can't do this.
- What?
"Tash, stop..."
"- Griff, just stop."
That's my sponsor.
I texted her.
"- What, you're in the program all of a sudden?"
"- Yeah, I am."
Come on!
I was sober for 8 months
- before you showed up at my door tonight.
"- Tash, listen."
"We can work out the whole stripping thing,"
"I was being an idiot, OK?"
Don't leave!
"If you leave, I'll have nothing."
We have a future.
"Listen, my wife and I are really lost."
"We're trying to get to Eugene, and I think we've been going the wrong way."
Can you show me what's going on here?
"Where are we, first of all?"
"Okay, wait."
Do I look like a tour guide?
"Why don't you buy the map, then I can help you."
Okay.
"Okay, now."
"Your problem is... (MAP RUSTLES) ...is you're way up here, you see that?"
- (DOOR CHIME RINGS)
"- Oh, my God, that is a problem..."
Yeah.
Now what you have to do is you have to take five all the way south toward Salem.
That's right down there.
You see that?

Hey!
- NEAL:
Okay.

"We're gonna put this bird at 30,000 feet in 45 seconds."
James William Sawyer.
Gentlemen.
What are you doing?

"Please, Martin, what are you doing?"
"I'm sorry, Ted."
- Martin!
- Consider this my resignation.
Emily?
"Where are you at, baby?"
Please tell me you got out of here.
Mr. Stenz.
We're in.
"No, not for you."
Ready now?
Hold on.
What?
Snacks.
THANK YOU...
You're not to have one.
"Yeah, yeah."
Watch your language.
Whatever.
You handled that well.
We should be okay now.
"Look, here he is!"
Walking by himself!
He did it!
So cute!
"Tetra, bodywork complete."
Tetra wants to use the internet.
But no-one's got a computer.
How about at school?
"It was stolen, remember?"
The new one's kept locked.
Especially during vacation.
How do you know?
"Well, I just know..."
What about PlayStation2?
No way!
Can you?
Even though it ain't a computer?
I read it somewhere.
You sure?
- How do you do it?
There are two kinds of metal in this yard.
Scrap and art.
"If you gotta eat one of them, eat the scrap."
What you currently have in your mouth is art!
Art?
(METAL CREAKING)
"Oh, forget it."
Forget it!
It's gone.
It's...
Hmm.
That's not bad.
HOGARTH:
"First, you take a chocolate bar."
Any bar'll do.
- Oh.
"- Do you mind if I, uh..."
"No, knock yourself out, skipper."
You crumble up the chocolate into little pieces.
Then you kind of stir it into the ice cream.
See?
"Yes, I see."
What do you call this again?
Landslide.
It's new.
Very new.
Mmm.
Landslide.
Topnotch.
Mmm.

The Atomic Age.
- I'll get some lemonade for you!
"- No, I don't want it!"
"Don't be silly, Mimì."
"Drink some, it'll do you good."
"- Here's a wet handkerchief, is that better?"
- Yes.
"I'm sorry if I made you mad, it's all my fault."
- Does your tummy hurt?
- A bit.
"- Does it really, really hurt?"
"- And if I give you a little kiss, will it still hurt?"
- I don't know.
"Shall we try, then?"
"Kids, come on, cut it out!"
Here's your lemonade.
"- No, I don't want it!"
- Come on.
- You don't want it?
- Don't be silly now.
- No!
"- Bonsoir, Monsieur!"
Excuse me...
- C'est complet!
"- Ah, no..."
- C'est complet.
Does a Mr. Raffaele D'Amore live here?
He has a moustache.
"Oui, il demeure ici, mais il n'est pas rentré."
- He's come in?
Now?
"- No, il n'est pas encore rentré."
"- Ah, he's not back yet."
Whoo!
Here you go.
"Thank you, son."
What's this?
Boiled skunk?
Some herbs.
They'll help with the cough.
"I'm proud of you, Daddy."
"You've made me proud too, son."
"Grown into a fine man, yes, sir."
I'm glad I got to see it.
Here.
I made this for your horse.
It's a bridle.
It's beautiful.

They might hurt her.
Give it to him.
- How much have you brought?
How much?
- It's not cash.
It's jewellery.
Jewellery?
Are you mocking me?
I asked for cash.
Are you trying to trap me with the jewels?
"Oldie, looks like you don't want your daughter back alive!"
Leave her!
Time out!
Collect her pieces and go!
The jewels are worth more than the money they owe you!
Don't rush.
Let her go!
Please!
Take it and leave her!
He can not get away from us.
There is the informer!
I can see him.
Yes.

But it's no excuse.
"You're not too sick to shoot, are you?"
It's your own old gun.
Works fine.
-Does it?
You're right.
"If we don't do it, who will?"
"They're walking around freely, everywhere."
"In Spain, South America, Germany."
And here.
-Exactly.
We have to settle this before we die.
I'm in.
-I expected nothing less.
Can I?
-I'll wait outside.
"Dr. Weinberg, come see Mr Haverman."
He shot himself through the head.
Where's his visitor?
-Visitor?
Sir!
Weren't you just with Mr Haverman?
"Yes, he asked me to wait outside."
What was that sound?
Come with me?
What are you going to show me tonight?
Eh?
Cameron!
- How long?
- Less than a minute.
Too late.
He's gone.
(PHONE CLATTERS ON FLOOR)
What time is it?
"Well, it's late."
- He said he'd only be an hour.
- Yeah.
I need the loo.
No key.
(SIGHS)
Aren't you tired?
Opposite.
You?
- I'm absolutely knackered.
- Get some sleep.
"Lie down, chill out, make yourself at home."
"Yeah, wake up and find all my credit cards gone."
How do you know him?
That gavver?
- Gavver?
- Smurf.
Billy Filth.
"Cos you're obviously not one of them, no offence whatever."
No offence taken.
"Well, um... it's a long story."
So give me the edited highlights.
OK.
"Hey, you there!"
"Look here, governor."
- Steady!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
- Police!
"Chase him, somebody!"
Get a copper!
Police!
Hurry.
"Come on, open up!"
Let me in.
I'm a friend of Dr. Jekyll's.
- Dr. Jekyll's not home.
- He told me to wait.
- I know all Dr. Jekyll's friends.
- Let me in!
- You'll have to come back.
"- Let me in, or I'll bash this door..."
"If you don't go away, I'll have to send for the police!"
That's him!
There he goes!
- This ain't no place to rob.
- But robbed it is!
Help!
Police!
"- Good night, Charles."
- Good night.
- Sorry your young man was detained.
"- So am I, Uncle Geoffrey."
"Good evening, sir."
"There was a ring at the door a while ago, sir."
"When I answered it, there was nobody there."
It's really coming along.
And cute too.
Give it a try.
"Testing, testing."
Hello.
"Argh, I don't believe it."
Tanya's got me detentioned for running in the hall.
"But school's out, everyone's running."
Argh!
Hmm.
Hmm...
"Looks like the dogs took you for a good walk, Mia."
"They're a handful, all right."
Kool Klip alert.
Everyone stay calm.
"Guys, guys, guys-"
Guess who's coming to Heartlake City.
It's...
It's...
Livi.
So gorgeous.
- So fashionable.
- So famous.
Wait.
Wouldn't it be great if she heard one of our songs?
Like that's gonna happen.
"Hey, let's record our new song now."
I've been playing with the lyrics.
"♪ Bring on the lights, set the stage ♪"
♪ In the mood to celebrate ♪
♪ We'll stick together through whatever Hand in hand ♪
♪ Let's live it up ♪
See?
- Which is also ironic.
"You were at a comedy club, and no one was laughing."
Hey shut up all of you!
Well I think I'm gonna take my furry little friend for a walk.
He's been locked in the basement all week.
"You know, why do they call it a ""fur coat"" anyway?"
"It's not made of fur, and it's not a coat."
"Uh, actually Harry, it's both those things."
It was a joke.
Ohh!
Good night everybody.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Yeah.
"Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick"
Nickelodeon.
Mm-hmm.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"

- I did?
I did.
"Um, Mom, this is Caleb."
Rivers.
"Nice to meet you, Caleb."
"Mrs. Marin, you have a lovely home, from what I've seen of it."
Caleb is new to Rosewood this year.
They brought me in to class the place up.
I see.
"Hanna, can I talk to you for a second?"
Is he some sort of rebound from Sean?
What?
No.
I don't want you alone with him in the house.
Go out.
"If you're gonna study, go to the library."
You let me study here with Sean.
"Well, I knew Sean."
Sean was a minister's son.
"Sean called you ""Hanna Banana."""
I'll get that for you.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- I'm looking for Mrs. Marin.
- Come on in.
"She's, uh, in the kitchen with Hanna."
You're crazy.
"You can go [bleep] off, Chef Ramsay."
We are so [bleep].
He's gonna eat us alive.
This will be the hardest...
You guys are useless!
I wanted to slap his ass.
[bleep] off!
fiercest...
Shut your [bleep] mouth!
I'm fine!
I'm just so pissed.
You'd better start listening.
I don't want to hear [bleep]!
How dare you?
"Fight back, young man."
Come on!
Come here!
wildest...
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
sexiest...
D-a-m-n.
Damn!
I'm just gonna completely
Pop out of my shirt.

Fresh fish!
Thank you!
- Red!
- Yeah?
- Where's section C?
"- Oh, it's right over there!"
"Right over here, I've got delicious, piping-hot Coney Island red hots!"
"Anybody else, now?"
"Folks, get your red-hot peanuts!"
Five cents a bag!
"Here you are, folks!"
- 2!
5- to-1 on Nelson!
- Will you pass that?
I'll lay you 3-to-1 !
"- Three-to-one, huh?"
- That's right!
"Well, I don't know!"
- What do you want?
- I've seen these guys fight!
"Three-to-one, and I'll give you the draw!"
Here comes Nelson!
"Here he comes, Little Boy!"
Sit down!
You're making too much noise!
"Okay, Little Boy!"
"Hello, Little Boy!"
"Hello, Bunny!"
How are you?
"I thought you meant ""career"" with a dollar sign."
I think we need more.
"Fireworks, shooting guns."
Maybe we need to get arrested.
"Yeah, that might be a little bit problematic for some of my younger, more impressionable fans."
"I have a lot of those, I'm told."
Hi.
Ashley. (CLICKS TONGUE)
"Oh, my God."
Hi.
- Josh.
- Josh.
Yeah.
- Wow.
How are you?

How you doin'?
It was...
- Beth's wedding?
"- Beth's wedding, right."
Wow.
Was a fun night.
I'm foggy.
- Good to see you.
"- Yeah, nice to see you as well."
You guys know each other.
"Yeah, we fucking live together."
(CLICKS TONGUE) Nice.
"How you take a punch, Josh?"
- (COUGHS) Excuse me?
- I think we should get into a fight.
For the article.
-Your way!
-Make your way
"Come, Erik."
Let's dance.
-Erik.
-My little one!
-I'll talk to him.
-Let me try.
"Hey, little one!"
Are you okay?
Do not you join the dance?
Do not.
-Can you say why?
-Why?
"No, no!"
What I say is ...
"Uncle Mano, I think he wants to know why dance."
"As if he needed one reason it is not, Erik?"
Yes.
There are many more reasons to dance.
What is my father?
The only way to is trying to figure out.
"Come on, son!"
Just one foot after another.
Nobody will laugh I promise you.
"Come on, climb on my feet."
I do not care with what people say
You'll get the hang.
Just need to feel the rhythm.
We are part Emperor of the Nation
"Come on, son!"
Let's shake this world!
- I hardly think so.
- Oh.
Let me introduce myself.
"My name is Mayley, Lord Mayley, and this is Miss Right."
"Oh, congratulations!"
"No, no."
That's her name.
Her name?
"Oh, how do you do?"
Yes...
Would you care for a glass of sherry while you wait?
"Yes, please."
"Er, has Mrs Ransom been a widow very long?"
"Oh, yes."
Many years.
Yes.
"Many, many, years."
Her poor husband died out east in rather mysterious circumstances.
- Oh?
- Yes.
"Drowned, poor fellow."
- Oh!
- Flora was in England at the time.
Oh.
- (Doorbell)
- Ah!
That may be she.
She's... (Chuckles) She's apt to forget her keys.
Let me do the talking.
"Good morning, sir."
Mrs Ransom?
"She's out but we expect her back, if you'd care to come in."
"Talk to the hand, 'cause, er... nobody round here's arsed."
Who rattled your face?
"I'm thinking of calling my mix the ""On The Bathroom Floor"" mix or maybe the ""He Shouts His Own Name When He Comes"" mix."
What are you gobbing on about?
Have you had your brain clamped and towed away?
- (PHONE RINGS)
"- Get that, our kid."
- I don't get calls.
- Further your people skills!
Yeah.
"Oh, right, hang on."
It's for you.
"- Troy, it's for you!"
- It can't be.
- It is.
It's for you!
- I don't get calls.
"Well, you're getting this one."
It's Donna.
Your wife.
Oh.
"Hiya, Donna."
- How's the wife?
- She wants me to move back in with her.
Oh.
"- D'you fancy it, or?"
- Aye.
Suppose.
- Best pack me bag.
- Yeah.
Suppose you best had.
Yes!
See me after the show.
I'll tell you more.
"I hate Huang, and Huang's suspicious of you."
Let's cooperate.
I'll send you out of the country afterward.
They'll never get you.
But you may not be able to take Huang single-handed.
- Mayor!
- Congratulations!
Thanks for coming.
Have a seat please!
"Have a few more drinks, Marshal."
I'll get myself drunk alright.
I've got to see Chiu at the theatre.
- I'll come along.
- Stay here!
"Ah Foon, but..."
But what?
You think I'll die?
What are we?
- Friends.
- Right.
Take revenge if I die.
What are you doing?
This is my family charm.
Take it.
Superstitious!
Wait for me!
Go to hell!
Mr. Chiu!
Substitution!
Help yourself!
- Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
"Jesus, Reznik."
Just wanna talk to you.
Hey come back.
"Reznik, Reznik!"
Reznik!
Trevor?
"Oh, no."
"Trevor, what happened?"
"Trevor, it's okay."
"Oh God, what happened?"
I was crossing the street.
Lights changed on me.
Did he stop?
"No, he just kept going."
He fucking hit 'n run drivers man.
He gotta be hanged.
It was my fault.
I wasn't paying attention.
"Trevor, I gotta get you to a hospital."
You may have some internal injuries.
It's just bruises.
"Okay, you see this?"
"This is a bruise, and this is a train wreck, alright?"
What is it with you and doctors?
Don't you trust anyone?
I trust you.
Now I know you're crazy.
Can I stay here tonight?
"Baby, you can stay here every night."
"Hey, my veil is the same as yours."
"Oh, you're right."
It is.
You're very pretty.
Thank you.
Are you the boy?
Yes.
You don't look as pretty as the bride.
Bye.
Bye.
Story of my life.
Ok.
Come on.
"Hey, are you waiting for them?"
If you could give us a ride I'll make it worth your while.
"Listen, Dale."
I'm too tired to drive.
Will you drive my car home?
Seven...
Ok.
Boy schmoy.
Dale.
Catch.
Hey.
Hey.
"No more douchebag boyfriends semi relationships, and keeping people at an emotional arms length."
I just wanted to say-
"No, wait."
"Sure, I'm putting myself at risk again."
But I'm finally ready to face an uncertain but promising future.
"You were right, Holly."
Because...
I'm having an asthma attack... from the stress !
"Oh, my..."
"Oh, my God."
Do you have an inhaler ?
Or like an Epi pen ?
I could stab you.
Maybe... we could just...
"sing ""Night Moves"" ?"
I think it might calm me.
Really ?
Please.
Uh.. uh... uh...
"* Little too tall, could have used a few pounds *"
* She was a black-haired beauty with big dark eyes *
That's good.
That's good.

I learned this when I was in Junior Lifeguard.

"Young man, what is going on ?"
"Oh, my."

You're truly our benefactor.
That's not true uncle.
The real benefactor's the One up there.
Boss.
Tauji...

Regarding anew contract.
Trilok your name's really apt.
Three diseases locked in your body.
I can't drink a glass of water in a single breath... and you hiccup sneeze and cough.
Get your self treated.
I've changed my doctor.
But Boss.
Trilok's contract is for tomorrow.
And tomorrow's Saturday.

Only singing and dancing.
"Yes, Tom."
"Yes, he is."
Sir.
I guess this is it.
Guess it is.
- Stay in touch.
- I will.
Throw them out of bed at 0300.
Interrogation Training.
The drunker the better.
"I'll see to it, sir."
Your ticket to Virginia.
I remember when that was you guys.
Brand new.
Excited.
Scared.
And then half of you don't come back.
And we lie to your families about why.
Tibor.
Charlie.
René...
I'm glad you'll be going somewhere safe.
"I'm not great at goodbyes, so..."
Safe.
Sitting at a desk.
Moving little pieces across a board game.
Tom...
There's something I need to tell you.
"You're going back, aren't you?"
Yeah.
"Klaus, we're gonna move you back to Bowmanville."
And I wanted to apologize.
"Well, what do you mean you don't-- What do you mean you don't need me?"
"- Al, if I'm here to help this girl,"
- You don't need... me?
I'm a little late.
[ Chuckles Nervously ]
Maybe I will sit this one out.
"[ Whirring ] Uh, Ziggy doesn't know why you're here, and about all he's got on the girl there is--"
Hilla.
Yes.
Hilla.
"Is she committed suicide by drowning... on November 9, 1 957."
November 9?
What?
What?
Today's her birthday.
She's 1 9.
Forever.
Why am I here?
I told you we don't know.
It's gotta have something to do with her.
Right?
"Who was she, Al?"
Who was she?
What songs did she like to sing?
Who'd she dream about at night?
William Holden.
What?
William Holden.
It's 1 957.
She's a teenager.
She had to have a crush on either William Holden orJames Dean.
"Uh, knowing her background, my money's on Bill."
He's also lucky because of you.
About what?
"You know, the go-getters."
Then feature your Auntie Isabel.
-She's a breast cancer survivor.
-That's right.
And guess what she's doing now?
-She's good!
-That will do.
-Why don't you feature your mom instead?
"-Oh, never mind."
"Dad wait, how many years have you been with mommy?"
Is it 29?
"Ara, is it 29?"
That's sweet!
You know what?
I wish me and Joy are just like that too.
Wait a second.
"-Oh, are you going to tell us something?"
"-Yes, of course!"
Why won't I?
.
"Dad, wait."
"It's like this, actually..."
She said...
Brother.
"-You've been together for just 1 year, right?"
-Yes!
So what?
Are you sure about your decision?
.
This is really all I want in my life.
- Okay.
- Okay.
"Uh, just grab a couple of bottles of chardonnay."
I'll get the sandwiches.
- These bottles?
BELINDA:
Yeah.
"- Christine, hi."
- Hi.
Um...
- I thought we didn't invite...
- We didn't.
She's here with Belinda.
- But I thought you fired...
- I didn't.
Hi.
I'm just helping out.
I'm a parent at Westbridge too.
"Actually, our kids are in the same class."
"Oh, The Kite Runner."
Oh.
What a great book.
The writing is super lyrical.
"Oh, not that chardonnay."
"Uh, could you see if there's any more Stags' Leap?"
"- Uh, I'd have a Merlot."
"- Oh, I'll have Merlot too."
Would you see if there's any bubble water in the fridge?
Yes.
"For you, a thousand times, yes."
Thank you.
"No, that's a line, um, uh, from the book."
He seems to...
"Well, he has..."
- a female.
- A female?
!
Cedric!
"Why, you brazen hussy!"
- Good heavens.
They're asleep!
"- Mumsie, look!"
Sergeant...
"The police, they found out!"
They've doped themselves.
We may still get away.
"- Mumsie, look!"
His moustache!
- They're onto us all right.
He's a plain-clothes brute disguised as an ordinary policeman.
We must get an earlier plane.
Stand guard while I finish packing.
- What's this for?
- To crown him with if he wakes.
- No!
"- In for a penny, in for a pound."
(Screams) No!
No!
Another?
!
Who is he?
- It's him!
- Him?
- It's him!
And I think you know what I want from you.
I think you know very well.
Hello?
It's me.
"Claire, hello."
"Yeah, I'm here."
Is Tracey there?
"Yeah, sure."
You want to talk to her?
She called me today.
She wanted me to call back.
"I know, she told me."
"Um, Tracey's asleep."
She's in bed.
Already?
Is she okay?
What's wrong?
She waited for you to call all day.
She's drawing things I don't understand and waking up at night.
"No, she's not okay."
Is there anything I can do?
"Let's talk about this another time, okay?"
I'll tell her you called.
Okay.
Nathan.
Nathan!
Nathan.
"Listen, I came to apologize for this morning."
I was a little heavy-handed and I wanted to apologize.
I have something to show you not far from here.
"Nathan, wait."
Listen.
You messed up my performance!
This is no time to dawdle.
W-what's going on?
How dare you destroy my daughters!
"You're not thinking you can leave this ship alive, are you?"
Ugh!
You look awful!
Damn you!
Laser...?
"I 'll give you some, too."
Here you go...
Kuya!
Damn you!
"Make it quick, Kuya!"
I'm not letting you get away!

You can't get anywhere firing blanks!
"Here's what you get, you old witch!"
"I'll leave the rest up to you, Kuya."
Cross Tornado!
"Do-wat, do-wat, do-wat"
I'm goin'!
Ooh.
I'm goin'!
"Hey, you guys... what do you say I propose a toast?"
Come on.
Oh... go away.
"Say it quick, before it stops fizzing."
"Shake it up, take a sip, and wish for what you want most in the world."
Okay.
I want to replicate my own DNA and win the Nobel Peace Prize.
Yeah.
Oh!
"Very good, Janie."
"Okay, shake it up, Sport."
Shake it up.
"I want to play more baseball games than Cal Ripkin, Jr."
"Oh, yeah!"
And get filthy rich doing it.
"Oh, yeah!"
"Shake it, Harriet."
I want to see the whole world and I want to write down everything.
"Harriet, slow down."
That's very impressive.
Harriet?
I'm goin'!
"That's good, Harriet."
"That's very pretty, isn't it, Janie?"
"Yes, I like it."
Got you!
"Hey, wait up."
"Everybody, hello!"
"Yeah, we completely believe that you eat cheeseburgers all the time."
Look at me!
I'm taking a bite!
That's my food.
- Mmm!
So good.
- Okay.
"So, um, are you guys gonna be home or away for Thanksgiving?"
Home.
Allen is gonna be in the city with the boys and his ex-wife.
They still do holidays and vacations together.
"- Don't you go, too?"
- Mnh-mnh.
His ex-wife hates me.
- Mm.
- Hates me.
Hates me.
She thinks I stole her husband.
Which I kind of did.
But not on purpose.
"You realize that's not a good story to tell people, right?"
I know!
"So, I'm gonna be all alone."
- Mm.
- By myself.
- Yeah.
- On Thanksgiving.
This coming Thursday.
"Well, enjoy the peace and quiet."
I will!
Okay!
- Bye!
( phone rings )
( people scream )
Can't think with the phone ringing.
"Dorothy, get over to the window and shut the blinds."
The rest of you stay put.
Don't do anything stupid.
"Come on, Dorothy!"
"All right, back with the others."
( cell phone rings )
What's that?
Whose is that?
Is that you?
Yeah.
- Answer it.
- You sure?
"Just don't say anything stupid, huh?"
Okay.
Hello?
"Ni-Ni-Nina, it's really not a good time."
"Allie doesn't run off, Nina."
That's not something she does.
I-I can't.
It's really hard to explain.
- Hang up.
- My daughter's missing.
- Hang up the phone.
- You can just wait.
Is she okay?
"- Yeah, she's all right."
- How do you know?
.
I know.
"And hey, I grabbed Emma's hand without even thinking about it."
Uh-huh!
- Years ahead of schedule.
- Great!

I know.
"I keep looking down at my hand like, ""What the hell?"""
"And, um... you're living in a big house out in Gladwynne now?"
It's crazy.
It's got nine bathrooms.
Really?
Does he have a problem?
"No, that's just how big the house is."
Oh.
Gotcha.
"So, where are you living now?"
I'm still in Narberth.
"- Oh, where?"
"- Oh, uh..."
Montgomery Street.
Doesn't your mom live...
Oh.
Yeah.
People are kind of afraid to come in here and get their coats.
So...
I volunteered.
"Yeah, coats."
Sure.
She gave me back my grandmother's ring.
Sorry.
Everything was so right.
"I mean, did I tell you our birthdays are one day apart?"
"Yeah, yeah, but I gotta say-a"
My birthday is the same day as that Son of Sam guy.

"- Mike, you're thinking about me here."
- Yeah.
- Were you thinking about Kat here?
- No.
- He was thinking about...

"I forget what I was thinking about, it wasn't Kat."
I don't think it was to do with the movie.
"It was probably, like, ""Why""..."
You were thinking about seeing No Country for Old Men.

Turn around.
Who's the boss here?
Who's runnin' this outfit?
You are?
What are you doin' here?
"Hear me, Jesse?"
You've done that to me before.
I couldn't think of anything else.
You were always lighting fires.
What fires?
Fires.
-What fires?
What fires are you talking about?
I don't remember any fires.
Get up!
Get up!
"We'll be fine, as long as we forget the past."
Deal?
-Deal.
Forget the past.
-Forget the past.
Here you are...
"Thanks, Marjukka."
Is Jesse still here?
"He's in there, brooding."
Jesse is a fine man.
He thinks a lot.
I think he's really deep.
"Hello, Jesse."
Marjukka!
You gave me this lighter.
It's out of gas and useless now.
I came here to see you - and it's your fault I always ended up in the garbage can as a kid.
Mrs. Hakkarainen!
-Don't...
I dumped him.
Guess why?
"Nothing, nothing."
I finish seeing the analyses.
-The analyses?
-Yes.
-You are hiding something to Me.
"-No, Calm no."
I do not want to die.
"Calm down, calm down."
"It must have an error, surely."
"help me, help me."
"Yes, but you must calm, you do not have to be altered."
"I only feel, I need much affection."
But...!
Mr. Santarelli!
I am much scared.
Why have you done that?
I do not understand...
-Call me Sandro.
"-Yes, yes, as you want."
Thanks.
Sandro...
I must return to the work.
Damn it is...
-Lella.?
I take you home?
-No.
Thanks.
-You are angry with me?
"-No, what goes."
"Well, it raises, I take to house."
I do not go to house.
I am going to make practices to a house of a friend.
It's only Chinese tea!
Chinese tea is still tea.
There're great Chinese tea!
"Mr. Lin, do I need to call security?"
"No need, David."
Mr. Mak...
Shut up!
I'm a member here.
Of course you are.
"Otherwise, our security would be here."
Fight with me if you've balls.
"I can't stop you guys, just be careful."
Help yourselves.
Other women love your money.
"Only Lisa loves you, right?"
I can't watch this.
Please look after them.
Bye.
There's a Lo Keung looking for Mr. Lin.
Pass it to me.

"Excuse me, Mr. Mak."
You want to wear your jacket now or after you dry yourself?
"Oh, we gotta talk."

You won three times!
Look at those trophies!
You look.
All I see is a bunch of empty cups.

- Mmm.
You smokin' hot!
There he is.
"Oh, my gosh!"
Did you know Doc is a famous racecar?
- Doc?
Our Doc?
- Not Doc Hudson.
"No, no, no, no, it's true!"
He's a real racing legend.
He's The Fabulous Hudson Hornet!
Fabulous?
I never seen Doc drive more than 20 miles an hour.
"I mean, have you ever seen him race?"
"No, but I wish I could have."
They say he was amazing!
- He won three Piston Cups!
- He did what in his cup?

"Yeah, let's stick a foot on there!"
I tell you what.
I'll do a few remixes for you.
"If you like 'em, we'll sort something out."
- Remixes of what?
"- Shut it, Gollum."
It's none of your business.
- None of my business?
Remixing?
DJ Troy?
- Them's the words.
Now make sense of 'em.
"""Exhibit A""."
Will you stop getting 'em out your bag?
It looks like a cannibals' picnic round here.
"- Who have you remixed, then?"
- Me.
"- Yeah, you."
"- No, me."
I've remixed me.
I remix me own tunes.
Right.
Any good?
No.
You've got one more guess.
"Think more ""opposite of good""."
"Just finished me album, ""Troy's Noise""."
"""Troy's Noise""."
Sounds French.
It's not just rhymes.
You suppose-a something else.
-What are you doing here?
-I come lookin' for some hand soap.
I don't have any hand soap here.
You got anything in the kitchen I could use?
Go use the station john.
I'd just get it dirty.
I'll tell him to get you some the next time he goes in.
Sorry to bother you.
You want a cup of coffee?
"Yeah, thanks."
"A nice place you got here, Mrs. Papadukis."
Papadakis.
"Oh, yeah."
Sorry.
Papadakis.
"What are you, Greek or somethin'?"
What...do I look Greek to you?
No.
Thanks.
So what do I call ya?
I guess you can call me Cora.
"A man, every man, needs to have a home."
"-You travel, huh?"
-Sure.
It's okay.
"But you know, the time come...."
The time come!
"Close the door, it is windy."
"Cora, give the man some wine."
-It's in the cupboard if he wants it.
"-Nice coffee, Missus."
Access granted.
"All right, Project Cadmus."
Genetics lab here in D.C. That's all there is.
"But if Batman's suspicious, maybe we should investigate."
Solve their case before they do.
It would be poetic justice.
"Hey, heh, they're all about justice."
But they said stay put.
"For the blotting-out-the-sun mission, not this."
"Wait, are--?"
Are you going to Cadmus?
"Because if you're going, I'm going."
Just like that?
We're a team on a mission?
We didn't come for a play date.
[SIR ENS WAIL ING]
-Help !
-Get us down!
Stay put.
We will get you out.
[BOTH GRUNT]
Whoa-
- Unh.
It's what's-his-name.
Flash Boy.
Kid Flash.
Why is that so hard?
So smooth.
Does he always have to run ahead?
We need a plan.
We--
-Robin?
Are you OK?
"You, of all people, drive me home!"
- To ease my guilty conscience.
"- Oh, dear."
Everybody else was completely drunk.
Theo?
Go to sleep.
As the moisture flowed into droplets...
- Slaving away again?
- What?
What are you doing?
Surprise.
I moved out of my apartment.
- You agreed.
- I told you.
I had to talk to Laura first.
It's her house.
- But there's so much space here.
- Yeah...
But you're not very easy on her.
- What do you mean?
- You know.
"You don't like Laura, and you don't try to hide it."
That's mutual.
Exactly.
"A great basis, huh?"
Shit.
- You aren't pleased.
"- Yes, I am."
"Yes, I am."
Really.
"I'll talk to Laura later, OK?"
He and his men are the front line.
He's in charge of this.
Whether you like it or not.
"Igor here, they're coming out."
- Headed for the cars.
- Gotcha.
"Big Luc here, they're coming out."
Two black SUV's and a Mercedes.
Standby.
I'll advise when they move.
"Seurat-Chenaf in the lead car, the Attia brothers in the second."
And the rest?
- I only see Boulanger.
- The SUV's are off.
They're taking off.
The SUV's are leaving.
Very slowly.
I see them.
They just passed us.
Let 'em leave the area.
Guy and Bernie tail the SUV's.
"We tail Horn, Boulanger, the chick."
We only hit 'em at the warehouse.
I repeat: don't hit 'em here!
The SUV's are stopped at the entrance.
- Horn and the chick are out.
- We'll be OK.
Armed to the teeth.
Where's he going?
Eve to Dennis.
What's up?
What are the orders?
- My kind of guy.
"- You are such an unfaithful, characterless woman..."
- Me?
Him?
"Dude, I swear."
Thank you so much.
What would have happened if you hadn't showed up.
"Sorry, sorry."
Shiv.
Nice to meet you.
It feels as if we go way back.
Me?
"No, people generally feel so."
But it isn't so.
"So, why are you being so intense?"
"Okay, we are childhood buddies."
Happy?
We are childhood buddies.
Happy?
Okay?
Sorted?
- Oh.
- Thanks.
- Aww.
- Cheers.
Cheers.
How cute!
You can buy her a drink but I'll be the one taking her home.
Guys?
It was a joke.
He gets serious very quickly.
"Just loosen up, okay?"

"Now, why would you tell your mom about a giant robot, slugger?"
"Say, what'd you see at the power station?"
"Huh, tiger?"

Been in the forest lately?

Dinner will be at 8.

You know you won't jump.

It's a log.
- He's a thief.

He popped off.
- He croaked.
- I don't understand.
- Dead.
- Great start!
- Take me to a hotel.
- I didn't get that.
There must be a hotel around.
"This time of year, at this hour?"

You razzin' me?
Okay.
Is there much more to walk?
Want me to carry it?
Come in.
It's kind of you to host me.
"please, this way."
Mr. Director...
Take your shoes off.
My mother's fanatical about dirt.
Watch your step.
Go ahead in.
"I'II camp out on the couch, I can't stay here."
I'II move the box.
"I'II get you settled, change the sheets too."
You shouldn't...
"It's moth balls, Mom puts them everywhere."
All done.
- That was it?
"- See, I told you I'm good."
"- No, don't worry, it's not permanent."
- Um...
Okay.
"What is this, like, some kind of memory test or something like that?"
- You'll find out.
"- Oh, okay."
You might feel a slight twinge as it initializes.
"Oh, okay."
Commencing at 5:38.
- You ready?
"- Yes, sir!"
Nearly there.
I thought I turned that off.
- All done.
You feel okay?

"Yep, yeah."

"Ilango, where is Kutty?"
Tell him to come.
He went somewhere.
Cuddappah Raju questioned him where he went.
He didn't tell him anything.
He hit him with an iron rod.
No Velu.
Listen to me.
Cuddappah Raja asked him several times.
He should have told him the truth.
That's his fate.
No Velu.
This is our curse.
Let's go.
How many times to tell you?
Are you deaf?
You fear death.
Not me.
Singamuthu is in jail.
I saw him.
They threatened me.
But I told them nothing.
Take him to hospital.
Make it fast.
Shocked?
I'm not Murugesh to get beaten up.
"I'm Vel, Singamuthu's son."
Vetrivel.
He will come.
I swear.
His words have come true.
One must give birth to a son like him.
Nonsense.
"Whatever you do, don't stop."
Just remember my motto at the exercise salon.

Don't make this any harder than it has to be.
"Oh, let her go."
Let her go.
Guess where I am?
- Um...

Really?
What's goin' on over there?
I'm in Colorado.
Wow.
"Hey, so I'm here for a few days."
"Any tips or things or ideas, uh, stuff I might do for fun?"
Uh... yeah.
"Actually, you can do some cool mountain biking while you out there."
"But Mom, while you're there, do not do any MDMA."
Okay?
- MDMA?
- Yeah.
That sounds terrible.
"- Yeah, it was."
- Yeah.
Must be very sunny to have to wear those sunglasses where you are.
"Oh, these?"
"Nah, it's just that, you know, a long night last night."
- Eyes a little baggy.
- Yeah.
"- So, anyway..."
"- Well, you look terrific."
Thank you.
"All right, Mom, well, I gotta go."
Ohh.

Is it okay that I miss you already?
It's very okay.
I has such a nice time tonight.
Can I tell you something?
I'm coming out of a... pretty dark time in my life right now.
You are?
Why?
"It's-it's just been, like, everything that, like, could go wrong has... gone wrong."
"And I almost... didn't make it to this party tonight, but I'm-I'm so glad that I did."
"You're, like, the, uh- the first good thing that's happened in my life in the last two years."
I am?
"You are like this amazing, shining, positive-"
Lina?
Lina?
Hello?
Hey.
What are you doing here?
What-
Good enough.
"Um, I don't know what this is."
I don't care.
I'll kill you!
What's the matter with you?
What's for dessert?
You sleeping?
You get some sleep.
Okay.
Very good.
All right.
"Listen, Burke, your car's at the curb."
Louie's waiting.
It's nice and warm.
"Yes, honey."

Fuck it.

-Really.
Blind is what he was.

This is a great party.

A car...
It nearly crashed into me.
"At the last second, I swerved."
It was all so sudden.
There were these lines... like a snake.
Where?
Like waves.
"What are you looking at, you idiot?"
I can't remember!

"Hey, but you're here."
That's amazing.

"- So listen, uh, do you have any plans for lunch?"
Lunch?
No.
"Well, my daughters are fixing me lunch."
Why don't you come over?
"Uh, I don't want to impose."
You're not imposing.
How about I pick you up around noon?
Noon?
Okay.
"All right, I'll see you at noon."

"A $60 Brazilian wax and he's grossed out, but yet Neosporin and scabs are apparently really enticing."
"Baby,I would do you if you had Bella's mole."
I just don't like it when you mess with yourself.
"You guys,you have to come tonight."
You have to.
Johnny's got a gig.
"And you're thinking if he meets your friends,he'll dump you."
"No,I'm thinking it'll make him happy and I want to be supportive."
Okay.
Uh-huh.
Right.

This first song is for a very special woman in my life.
"Bella,put your hand up."
I want everyone to see who you are.
"Wait, check you out."
"Girl, you ain't all churchgoing goody two shoes."
Look at that frumpy old church.
"It moved, God moved."
"Shut up, puta."
"Kike, please!"
What the fuck.

Oh...

That's my son.

"Don't blame me for this, E.!"
What the fuck were you doing this whole time?
"I was working, pendejo!"
"Where were you, huh?"
Tough guy?
No.
Where were you?
"Angie, you don't get it."
The shit that...
Goes down behind those walls.
You can't understand.
"And here, my son wants to be like this."
(Music playing from club)
(Woman) All right!
So we ready to keep it going?
What about Wicklow?
When you disgraced yourself running round half naked?
"No, not that."
The singing competition.
"Oh, you were a star that night."
My Rosemary.
First prize.

"I can't, Tommy."
"Jesus, it's been years."
Course you can.
You've a gorgeous voice.

Not like that.
Do it properly.
Like you did in Wicklow.
"Now, go on."
"You're a menace, Tommy Cassidy."
"# Oh, please ne'er forget me... #..."
Though the waves now lie o'er me
# I was once young and pretty
# And my spirit ran free
# But destiny tore me from country and loved ones
# And from the dear land
# I was never to see
Get the fuck off me.
-Get off of Jacob.
Get off him.
I was supposed to protect him.
She's taking him to houston.
Fuck that bitch.
"Come on, man, get up."
Let's get outa here.

You finished?
Yeah.
Alright.
I saw your probation report signed on your bed.
Mr. Dominguez said that you'll be back at Barker sooner than you thought.
I'm real proud o'you.
'You hear what I said?
Yeah.
What?
"I don't know, you just ...."
You look like her sitting there.
We made a great team didn't we?
The four of us.
[Plate on kitchen table].
[Washing dishes].
[Jacob takes keys]
[Lawn sprinklers].
"Hey Wes, get up."
Come on.
What are you doing here?
"Hurry up, pack your things let's go."
Why?
We're leaving.
No.
No more talking.
No more lies.
No more lies ever again.
"Nice, but you still have your training wheels on."
Ada!
"Ada, come here."
At least I can still see the road.
Come on.

There's no time.
Bo!
Don't leave me.
"Come back here, you bitch."
"- I'm here, baby."
- Okay.
Okay.
Bo.
Stay back!
What's going on?
What the hell just happened?
I guess some people don't deal well with rejection.
Thought I'd be extra crispy for sure.
As if I could get rid of you that easily.
"Hey, Bo."
"I'm not like Jenny, am I?"
I'm not too clingy or anything?
You make me want to be a better Fae.
Go seduce a yak.
My God.
Mass destruction and two dead Furies.
"If it's the chocolates that Saeko-san loves the most, then all the more."
"The confectionery school's graduation exam is today, right?"
Yeah.
"Well, since my family has a cake shop..."
I think I'll be fine.
"Rather, I can finally show my performance."
Performance?
Eh?
What?
"- Ah, nothing."
"Ah, hey."
Can we meet on the 14th?
Valentine's day.
I'm a bit busy on the 14th...
"Ah, I'm sorry."
"Well, that's right."
"A guy shouldn't be asking you out on that day, right?"
Sorry.
"Then, the 13th?"
- That's fine.
"Ah, thank goodness."
"Then, the 13th."
- Yeah.
"Then, on the 13th."
Yeah.
- Yeah.
"I'll text you later, okay?"
Bye bye.
"- Yeah, bye..."
I feel like I've been casually rejected...
"Oh, that's right."
The place was bad.
Next!
You better catch them for me!
What are you doing here!
Line up!
Go!
Line up!
Line up!
Shut up!
You're all useless!
I'm so mad!

It's so embarrassing!
Like a piece of cardboard?
Looks like she hasn't had enough nutrition
"Even though it's a bit flat, but on a closer look"
It's actually not bad.
"Throw at her, it's funny!"
Really?
"Thanks, Master Zhou!"
"Master Zhou, keep on playing!"
"Thanks Master Zhou, thank you!"
"She got it again, throw at her, quick!"

[Crying] Jesse.
Aw I'm sorry.

[Grunting] Zip it!
Look nothing personal but sometimes you just...
Have a tendency to be a big dumb daddy?
I would never say that because you let me live here.
"But because you said it, oh yeah!"
Now look Miley.
Jesse... that guy your dad just mentioned.
Is your past and these letters are your future.
I guess you're right.
Of course I'm right!
"Okay now we'll open them on three, ready?"
"One, two."
Three!
I didn't get in.
I didn't either.
Oh I'm sorry girls.
I'm sorry you both didn't.

You're okay.
I love you so much.
The president.
He shot him!
He shot him in there.
"Look, I need you to listen to me."
"There's an air strike coming, I need you to run."
I need you to run as far and as fast as you can possibly go.
Can you do that?
I gotta get the president.
Okay.
You gotta go for me.
"Now, go."
Hundreds of people seem to be running toward the White House.
"They've been told to evacuate too, but they're climbing the fence."
"Okay, we have confirmation."
Where did he go?
You want to wear it now or later?
Go to hell!
"Sir, be careful."
Slippery floors.
"Mr. Lin, I'm Lo Keung."
Why is this with you?
I found it at the crime scene.

Understood.
Dropping the hellfire.
Yankee... that's all?
Yes.
"It's a GUNK, isn't it?"
Everyone listen!
Gimlet here.
The bombing failed.
The enemy is getting closer.
As shown on the screen it's a self-supported tank.
"But, we will proceed as in practice."
I will move to position too.
"Male, until then, be the look out."
Male here.
Understood.
I should be able to see it.
It's coming!
Marking it with the laser.
What is he doing?
"Male, are you ok?"
I marked it with the laser!
It looks like we finished the job.
"Male, life check."
All green.
Male.
System check.
It made me run...
All green.
Let's start.
Understood.
Dropping one.
"Yeah, come... 4 seconds until impact... 3... 2 1"
She goes through my pockets some nights.
"Oh, absolutely."
Which horse?
"- Uh, Dragonfly."

Oh.
"Well done, old boy."
"No, could you keep it?"
"No, I couldn't do that, very decent of you..."
"No, could you keep it just tonight?"
"It's Sybil, you see?"
Secret.
"Ah, a present."
"Sort of, yes."
Don't mention it.
Mum's the word.
I'll get it from you in the morning and bank it.
"Understood, old boy."
Cheers.
"There you are, Mr. Mackintosh."
"There you are, Mr. Mackintosh."
"Good morning, Mr. Fawlty."
"Good morning, ladies."
Hello.
Fawlty Towers.
Watt!
I didn't say anything.
Have you called the police yet?
"Excuse me, I'm trying to take a telephone call."
Have you called them yet?
You need to be strong now.
Tell me you're gonna be strong.
I'm trying.
You can do this.
I know you can.
You're brave.
Braver than anyone.
"I'm not brave, Mom."
I pretend that I am.
And I want people to think that I am.
But I'm not.
"I'm really, really scared."
That maybe we are actually what's wrong in this world.
Divergents.
I never wanted any of this.
You and Dad and Caleb and then Four.
And I can't help but think that if I was normal we would all still be together.
"Mom, I don't wanna be Divergent anymore."
I just wanna feel safe again.

He's here.

In your room?
- No.
"Oh, good."
So who's there?
Are you still fooling around with Albert?
No.
- A new lover?
- No.
And my other tenant?
Is he seeing someone too?
I bet you're building a little love nest.
"I mean, separately."
"No, I don't think he's seeing anyone at the moment."
I just really miss that bastard.
- Johan?
"- No, for Christ's sake!"
"We're,like,at..."
Wilson's.
Hey.

My sister's car got towed.

"Oh,yeah,I guess you can't really sing along to the new stuff,huh?"
"I don't sing,remember?"

I do.

What's up with that?
"What,you don't like it?"
I dig it.
"It's just,I..."
"I admire that you can do the ""in the eye"" thing."
It makes me look like Boy George.
"Yeah,well,uh  you never needed any help drawing attention to your eyes."
"So,how's..."
"It was good to see you,Bella."
- Oh.
Okay.
- Take care.
Bye.
Hello.
You're gonna be okay.
Just gotta get a little bit of power into you.
"Ladies, could you give us a bit of space, please?"
Thank you.
"You're a big deal, you know?"
You're not the only one wronged by Akan.
You and I both want the same thing.
This may hurt a bit.
(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)
There we go.
(PANTING)
That's wonderful.
Now I can take you back to my lab.
"I'm Jimmy, by the way."
I realize this is all very confusing for you.

One dark and windy night.
A female vampire was in search of a virgin boy's blood.
"Tonight she found her victim,"
So she walked slowly to the door.
I'm not a virgin!
You scared me!
"Robin darling, I need you!"
What?
I need you!
Me...too!

You mean right here?
But the bed's a little small!
"If you don't go to rescue Yoyo, he's done!"
Rescue Yoyo?

"- No, why?"
"Okay, never mind."
Thank you.
- Sure.
Sanchez.
"- Detective, it's Danny Ferman."
Hi.
"- Danny boy, how are you?"
I'm good.
Thank you.
"Did you guys call my office to pull,"
Sophia's voicemail off my machine?
Maybe.
We do that.
I'll look into it.
"Oh, and by the way, tox came back on her."
OD'd like I said.
- Okay.
We got a statement from the neighbor.
Russian woman.
A real character.
"- Yeah, I saw her last night."
"She said she saw a man stop by at the vic's early in the day, but no sign of a struggle."
"My gut says they were either shooting up together, or he was a dealer."

Vague.
She said it was a white guy.
Big.
Really big.
That's it?
- That's it.

You failed at marriage.
- Twice.
Someone gave you a third chance.
- I didn't do drugs.
"Frank, all I'm asking, as a colleague, as a friend..."
And it's still no.
What are you doing here?
You're not on graveyard.
A friend was admitted so I thought I'd stick around.
Everything OK?
Think so.
I hope so.
- Cup of tea?
- Green.
Thanks.
Thanks...
"Alright, alright!"

"Sandy, the police won't, just..."
It's better if...
I hate to ask.
You want me to beg?
You want me to beg from you?
- OK.

"OK, Sandy, I'm begging."
I am begging from you Sandy.
"I need some money so please, could you give me some money?"

A ladies handkerchief?
In brother's hand?
It is not possible.

Her parents stopped talking after they broke up.
You know what she did?
"Hi, darling."
Long time no see!

We're celebrating.

The Hovitos are near.
"The poison is still fresh, three days."
They're following us.
"If they knew we were here, they would've killed us already."
This is it.
This is where Forrestal cashed in.
A friend of yours?
A competitor.
He was good.
"He was very, very good."
Senor... nobody's come out of there alive.
Please...
Senor.
Stop.
Stay out of the light.
Forrestal.
Let us hurry.
There is nothing to fear here.
That's what scares me.
Stay here.
"If you insist, senor."
Give me the whip.
Throw me the idol.
No time to argue.
"Throw me the idol, I throw you the whip."
"Of course, my son."
Congratulations my dear!
"Dad, you really have a good taste."
Another one?
"Well Dad, I really want me and Joy to be just like you."
It was so sudden.
"Just come home, please?"
"You're his first love, you know."
He only met that Joy because you left for Canada.
"Please Bela, just come home please?"
.
I really don't want Joy to be my sister-in-law!
She's not on the same level with my brother.
"Come on Ara, you've already pre-judged the person."
But it's true!
"I'm right, am I not?"
Right?
I'll just get back at you.
"Oh my, will you fix that quickly?"
"Make it fast, come on!"
-Hey here!

"Oh, you've heard of them."
"Wait, wait, wait, look."
"- Look, look, look."
"- Oh, yes, yes, yes."
"The Chemical Brothers, okay."
Uh-huh.

Wow.
"Now, they're real brothers, right?"
"- Well, I would hope so."

"Well, this is nice."
"Very impressive, huh?"
"- Yes, it is."
It's cool.
- Very nice.

"Oh, thank you, Christine."
We're just gonna throw those in the salad.
- Okay.

"Try her at home, right?"
'Bye.

This rocks.
Where did you get it?
Yugo Danny.
It's hard-hitter blow from Columbia.
"- Angel, come on."
Are we going?
- Yes.
"- Come on, let's go."
"Come on, Mike."
Reply to the phone.
- Will not Answer?
- Do you have to move this bear herey Hery?
- My mother had given me.
- Okay.
I'm sorry.
What do you think?
"Beautiful, is not it?"
- What's the problem?
- I do not like this place.
"This is only temporary, okay?"
Just for a two nights.
Remember?
"Soon, not whisper their home."
"Who knows, maybe one of those pools."
"First, a few need to handle the job, okay?"
"Then they whisper very, very far away."
- Really?
- Yes.
- You know what?
I am sure that Bella liked here.
"- No, I did not like."
Is that right?
Let us ask him then.
"It's beautiful, Bella?"
See?
Complacent.
Ah...
Yeah.
- Wow.
- Huh?
You're amazing!
What are you doin'?
"Doc, wait!"
Giddup right in there!
"Come on, Rusty."
"Doc, hold it!"
"Seriously, your driving's incredible!"
- Wonderful.
"Now, go away."
"- Hey, I mean it."
You've still got it!
- I'm askin' you to leave.
- Come on.
"I'm a racecar, you're a much older racecar, but under the hood you and I are the same."
We are not the same!
Understand?
"Now, get out."
How could a car like you quit at the top of your game?
You think I quit?
Right.
Your big wreck in '54.
They quit on me.
"When I finally got put together, I went back expecting a big welcome."
You know what they said?
"""You're history. """
Moved right on to the next rookie standing in line.
There was a lot left in me.
I never got a chance to show 'em.
I think Joe there is the answer to that question.
"Let this thing lie down, John."
Understand?
"Thank you, John."
"Bob, look at this:"
"""Man thrown in prison for eloping with his sister-in-law. """
I'll be.
I wonder what he did.
Put down the paper and play.
It's cold.
"Nolt boy got killed, Tom."
- Who's that?
"- Nolt boy, Jimmy Nolt."
How did that happen?
Shot with a.45-.60.
"That's what I shoot, a.45-.60."
"Shoot what, Tom?"
Prairie dog.
- Jimmy Nolt's dead.
- Yeah.
Where's your horse?
"He's dead, too."
I knew you'd be there.
- You did not.
- Okay.
I heard the news.
You still working that horse I started for you?
It's about the Nolt boy.
What about him?
They found a rock under his head.
Like those other three fellows from Brown's Hole.
You seen Joe Belle around?
-Yes.
He tries to buy their freedom.
Why would he do that?
He lives a good life in Malaysia with his wife and children.
How do you know?
"William, have you had contact with him?"
I had to do something.
-Oh my God.
No.
It is you.
You asked him to come here.
10.2 million euros.
That is the price for Karine?
"He killed her, he hit her head against the stone until it cracked!"
Finally.
It was not him.
Tonje saw him somewhere else.
The alibi was a joke!
We all know it!
Try to think ahead.
Think of the responsibilities we have.
Here you can not ask me.
Never.
Never.
Hey dear.
"God, so good to see you."
-Oh?
Has it been good?
Aksel Nilsen.
It's rescuer.
-The Aksel Nilsen?
-Yes.
Perfectly harmless.
- Vets use them all them time.
- Will it hurt it?
No.
It'll put it out for a few minutes.
Everyone stay quiet.
"Jo, don't miss this."
I never miss.
- Did you miss?
- No.
There's two of them.
Two beasts?
Wait.
They might not be fully under yet.
- I have to see them.
- Let me and Steve get them into the container.
"Safety first, OK?"
- OK.
- Jo.
What about safety first?
Fine.
Miss the reveal.
"Steve, go ahead and check they are out."
Maddy and Rhydian are going to be mad they missed this.
- You OK?
"- Yeah, why?"
You're shaking.
Is this happening?
"Like, is this actually happening?"
Yeah.
Believe it.
I don't think I can.
End of discussion.
If the contract's been taken the job will be done.
Fine then I'll leave.
- See you uncle.
- Bless you.
Boss.
An elderly person's waiting for you outside.
I asked him to come in but he refused.
He's standing outside in the hot sun.
Ask him what he wants.
No he wants to meet only you.

- Danny Mitchell.
Danny used to work in the D.A.'s office.
You look good.
You still on patrol?
"No, actually, today is the first day of my new job-- I made detective."
Congratulations.
Which department?
Internal Affairs.
Wow!
Bet your family loved that.
"Oh, no, she hasn't told them yet."
Oh...
Okay.
Good luck with that.
I should get going.
- It's really great seeing you.
- You too.
"Maybe we could grab lunch, catch up."
"Yeah, sure."
Sounds great.
"Here, call me with a time."
Call me if you need a lawyer.
Thanks.
All right.
He is so cute.
What is the story with you guys?
We're just friends.
The guy was totally into you.
"No, he wasn't."
- Do you mind if I call him?
- No.
It's hot!
Bad idea!
Bad idea!
- Put me down!
- Okay.
Thank you.
Okay.
Nobody panic.
We're only in here for two hours.
Four hours.
Four hours!
"""Four hours...!"""
"Oh, my God."
"You know, if you ever want to get serious about wine, you really have to lose the mustache."
"True, 'cause it gets all caught up in there."
Mm-hmm.
That makes sense.
- Yeah.
Pee-ew!
Be a lot easier if you just shaved it.
"I'd rather not, Rick."
I'm not shaving it.
I didn't bring shaving equipment.
"Bobby, quit being a pinot grouchio!"
"Look, I'm perfectly happy enjoying my wine, staring out the window at that... kid on a bike, going the same speed as us?"
And we are friends.
I call him Ramon.
"Hi, Ramon!"
What?
Hi!
I can't hear you.
What?
Paris.
Champs Elysees.
Gracefully.
Okay.
"And now, walk as if a string is pulling you from the crown of your head."
Walk as if you're hanging in midair.
"I said string, not rope."
"Yes, keep walking, good."
Shoulders down and turn around.
And...
Other side.
Walk with your foot in the air and...
Keep going.
It went really well today.
Good.
We did two more scenes.
Great.
I thought you'd come back.
You're mad at me.
Why?
You should move out.
You're paying rent for nothing.
"I'm going away, Dad."
Where to?
For how long?
I don't know.
Overseas is good.
You think so?
Yes.
I think your mother would be very proud of you.
"Good night, Gonki."
"Good night, Daddy."
Never has there been a longer line in the history of check-in lines.
Unzip me.
Mm.
"God, you are beautiful."
What's it like being so beautiful?
Clear.
- Clear.
"Oh, no."
"No, no, no."
"Dawkins is gone, so is Craig."
"You're gonna be okay, we're gonna get you to a hospital."
Craig.
- We're gonna find Craig.
"Detective Kelly, Five-0."
We need an ambulance.
Kahiko Hotel.
"- Come on, come on, come on."
- On the way.
She's not breathing.
"Hang in there, Dana."
Okay?
Hang in there.
It's all gonna be okay.
"We're gonna find Craig, okay?"
We'll find Craig.
"Hey, how is she?"
- She's in surgery.
Didn't give me anything on the way.
What do we got?
Hotel surveillance cam picked this up right after the attack.
Doesn't add up.
Why take Craig and leave Dana?
And promise me you're not talking to your brother!
No.
Promise me.
Otherwise I'm very angry!
Promise me!
Give me your cell phone.
Now!
House arrest!
She wants to pull us apart.
Does that hurt?
- Does that hurt?
- No.
Does that hurt?
"Mama, please come back."
I'll do anything you want.
"Please, come back."
All I want is for you to come back to us.
Elias?
Cut another bit away at your ear.
There?
Better?
Now we look the same.
Now she can't keep us apart.
It's me.
Open the door.
Are we friends again?
I'm not angry anymore.
Please open the door.
Well?
Are we friends again?
I got something.
Thanks.
You've... already ruined me.
Exactly what do you want?
Your life.
Back then...
I had no choice.
You're saying you had no choice back then?
You don't have a choice now either...
you have to die.
No!
No!
NO!
Don't come.
Don't come.
Don't come.
Don't come.
Don't come.
Don't come!
Don't come.
Don't come.
I beg of you!
Please save me!
I beg of you!
I...

Please save me...
The classified document is in the car crusher at the junkyard.
"Lee Yoon Sung,"
You reveal it.
Kim Young Joo!
Did you find it?
Upon the terrorist bombing attack at the Aung Sung Mausoloeum by North Korea.
It was asserted that the North needed to be punished.
"Yeah, I've decided to do this."
I'm going all the way.
"In fact, today counts as our third date, so when I say I'm going all the way, I mean, I'm going to..."
- Mrs. Nunley.
Hi.
- Hi.
I just wanted to make sure I got to say hi to all the grandparents.
Oh.
"Unfortunately, my parents couldn't make it this year."
Oh.
"Oh, that's too bad."
And you are...?
"Oh, I'm Christine Campbell."
I'm Ritchie's mom.
"- Oh, of course."
Hi.
- Hi.
We invited my father instead.
"Oh, fantastic."
And you must be...?
I'm also Christine.
His girlfriend.
"Oh, I see."
Which would make you...?
"I'm Ritchie's dad, her ex-husband."
Her boyfriend.
Hi.
"I know it sounds a little complicated, but I'm fine with it."
"It works for me, so nothing else really matters."
"- Oh, my God!"
- What?
I just thought of the greatest thing.
I had to ...
So for my sister.
"Mike, slow down a bit."
Listen.
Nursery with me after 20 minutes I want to buluşmanı.
Did you hear that?
I'm going there.
OK.
"I trusted you, Mike."
I got through.
Take a look at how the response has given me.
"- There is a way, I'm sure."
"- This is officially bullshit, Mike."
"- Sculpture, where, Mike?"
- $ 1 million.
Leave me and my brother.
This Agreement.
"Agreements you will not you, Mike."
I'll do it.
"The best thing you can do, is to save his brother."
"He is now the location of the statue say, let live."
"- If you do not, it dies."
I can assure you.
- Then you do 2 million.
"Damn where is sculpture, Mike?"
Get up!
I.ne you stand up!
"I i.ne damn, come on!"
"Come on, Mikey!"
Stand up!
Come on!
"- Fuck, man!"
There's gotta be another way outta here.
Buzz?
Was that you?
"Hey, hi there, little fella."
Come out here.
Do you know a way outta here?
Buzz!
They're cannibals.
"Mayday, mayday."
"Come in, Star Command."
Send reinforcements.
"Star Command, do you copy?"
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
Great.
Great.
"Yeah, and if anyone attacks us, we can blink 'em to death."
"Hey, you guys, I think I found him!"
"Buzz, is that you?"
"Whiskers, will you get outta here!"
You're interfering with the search and rescue!
"Look, they're home."
"Mom, have you seen Woody?"
Where was the last place you left him?
Right here in the van.
"Oh, I'm sure he's there."
You're just not looking hard enough.
"He's not here, Mom."
Woody's gone.
Woody's gone?
"Yeah, boy, the weasel ran away."
Huh?
Huh?
- You're welcome.
Welcome.
Thank you.
"- Son of a ""beetch. """
- Son of a bitch!
- Good!
- What's the difference?
Bitch is a female dog.
Beach is the sand by the ocean.
"- English, please."
- Asshole.
"- Fuck you, slut!"
"- Up yours, dickhead!"
- Eat my shorts.
- Blow me!
- Motherfucker!
- Cocksucker!
"Shit, that's very sexy."
For that... the referee will give you a red card.
It's a big soccer game tonight.
The national team is playing.
It's on the TV.
- Is Acacio playing?
- I'm sure.
"Well, let's get started, then."
Why don't you open to page 3 5 and read?
Do you prefer on the top or below?
I beg your pardon?
The reading.
I should read on the top?
"You mean, should you stand up?"
I'm sorry.
"- A federale, right in front of him."
"Three agents wounded, one lost his leg."
It's like what you hear about in Iraq or something.
- The IEDs.
- Jesus.
I had to hear about it from Steve Gomez.
Hank talked to his SAC for about an hour.
Hank should win an Oscar.
He's so damn breezy with the man.
"He hangs up the phone, goes right back to bed."
"And all he keeps saying is,"
"""I'm fine."
I'm fine.
"Leave me alone""."
"Baby, not now."
"It's me, Hank."
Sorry.
"Hey, buddy."
What's up?
I just...
Do you mind if I...?
"No, no."
So...
How you doing?
You know.
Lousy.
"Montezuma's Revenge, big time."
"I mean, everything's going through me like crap through a tin horn."
Better not get too close.
I'll take my chances.
I guess you heard about what happened down in Juárez?
Terrible.
Mm.
See?
That was easy.
It's like I always say.
"When it comes to good parenting, you have to be fair but firm."
"You just show him that you mean business, and he's out of bed again, isn't he?"
You never have this problem with sock puppets.
Aah!
Oh!
All right.
What's this all about?
Voices.
- Voices?
- Uh-huh!
In here!
Telling me what to do!
You have voices inside your head.
Sometimes.
And what kind of things do they tell you to do?
Oh!
Oh...
The early bird catches the worm!
What's gotten into this kid?
Hey...
Ow!
Hey!
Maybe you sing him a little song.
"Come here, y..."

Do I look like the kind of guy that knows a lullaby?

"Thankfully, range anxiety would be a thing of the past."
Yeah!
Plug it in!
Hold on.
Stay with me.
I'm plugging.
We got it!
You got it?
I'm charging!
Yes!
- I'm charging while driving!
- Great!
- How many amps is that?
- 15.
I need 400.
"A couple days, you should be fine."
We could do this as a service for people...
Rut and Adam's electro refueling.
I knew it would work!
"You're a man of science, Rutledge Wood."
This is genius!
"Well, it's something."
It only takes a truck getting 17 miles a gallon for an electric car to charge.
You're saving the earth.
One charge at a time.
Excellent.
Let's go.
"Yes, of course."
There.
Set it up and push it.
Never take this off.
Let me know when it rings.
You know why I gave you this important thing?
Yeah.
I don't trust the others.
Try not to touch it.
"Dad, have a look here."
Is everyone here?
Have a look.
Champagne?
We need this for such a great day like today.
And I've prepared one more thing.
Want to see?
What's he doing now?
He makes me so nervous.
Don't be surprised.
Congratulations on being human!
Congratulations on being human!
Who's that?
"Wait, that's..."
Hurry and escape.
- What are you doing?
- Be quiet.
Just do what I say.
Now go!
Where the hell are we going?
"Mr. Hong, where've you been?"
Stay there.
Get off of me!
"Water vapour doesn't stop ice, I should've realised!"
Get off!
Let her go.
Let her go now!
NOW!
Get off of me!
Clara!
Argh!
Arr!
No-o-o-o-o!
What was that?
It's Clara.
Dear God.
"Oh, dear God, where did she fall from?"
We have to get her inside.
Those things will kill you!
She's hurt.
She's dead.
What is that?
What is happening?
!
He's bringing her in.
"That green woman said she was dead, how can she be alive now?"
This technology has capacities and abilities beyond anything your puny human mind could possibly understand.
Try not to worry.
Isn't the creature still a danger?
It could reform.
"No, not in here."
Then you should be with Miss Clara.
"She's going to be fine, I know she is, she has to be."
"Doctor, her injuries are severe."
Lift it.
Careful.
You'll have it bursting all over the place.
Come on!
Do you realise that the contents of this cabinet could rock London to its foundations?
"And provide very interesting reading, too!"
"Oh, Henry?"
"- Oh, my heart!"
"- Yes, that's the trouble."
Another storm?
No...
Seaweed.
That's it.
That's it.
"Yes, I..."
I had a dip.
- A midnight dip.
- Fully clothed?
"Well, I couldn't go in in the nude, could I?"
"Well, could I?"
- I fell in.
"- Well, fall into bed."
- I'll get the doctor.
- I'm going out again.
Where to this time?
The Serpentine?
(Tuts)
I'll get Maria to lay out your frogman's outfit.
Go and clean up.
You look a terrible sight.
(Doorbell)
"Oh, good evening."
You got any problems picking up the van?
No.
"All right, so it's all filled up, we're ready to go?"
Filled up?
Riley.
"Come on, man."
Details.
No...
I'm sorry.
You mad?
"I'm not mad, I just,"
I'm disappointed.
All right?
You're my crew.
So bring your A game.
I'll go do it right now.
"No, forget it."
"I mean, we have enough time tomorrow morning to fill up the tank."
It's the principle of the thing.
Let's just go over this again.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Ollie.
What's he doin' here?
Just hear 'im out.
No.
"Connor, I just came by to say that"
I appreciate all the help.
Jellyfish.
"Yeah, I'm really just helping my sister out."
So...
Anything to drink?
No.
Water for me.
"Nothing, thanks."
"No, excuse me, uh..."
"Actually, we'll have two strawberry milkshakes, extra whipped cream."
We couldn't find you anywhere.
"You know, finally, your mom stayed up top, and I took the elevator all the way down to the ground floor."
"And I got out of the elevator, and there you were, reciting the alphabet, in French, to, uh, the security guards at the CN Tower."
"And you were little, too."
You couldn't have been more than five.
Not scared though.
"Nah, not one bit."
Heh.
Take your time.
Thank you.
Oh.
Damn.
What's wrong?
Heh.
"My, uh, wallet was in my jacket."
"Oh, no way."
Way.
Do you have money?
I'll pay you back.
I promise.
Yeah.
Um...
Three and change.
That's it?
Yup.
"Mmm, not enough."
It's most embarrassing.
I'll come and see you tomorrow...
I can't.
I've got a board meeting and a charity dance.
I'll come the day after tomorrow.
"Until then, expose nothing."
"- Where do you live, by the way?"
"- 54, Chillingdon Court."
You know it?
"Yes, I used to have..."
Day after tomorrow.
- Ah-ah.
This way.
The firm will...
- The firm?
!
"Yes, the firm will try to straighten out matters."
- We will try and find the man.
- Dennis?
But I know...
Do nothing till you hear from me.
"12:30, the day after tomorrow."
Phew!
54... 54...

Shall I jot it down for you?
No!

I've been dreaming about you for months.
My name's not Ursula.
What is it?

How old are you?
I don't know.
Have any kids?
Why not?
"Ursula, be mine!"
Only three bucks!
Damn bitch!
Always suspicious.
Always messing around.
I'm getting fed up.
Got any bright ideas?
I might if I had some bread.
Hold on.
Whas up?
An idea.
What?
Is staring you in the face.
Is still warm.
Don't start in again.
"Feels good, doesn't it?"
How's that for a smooth ride?

Want some toilet paper?

-Yeah?

Oh Mr. Chaddha!
"-Yeah, go on!"
"Mr. Chaddha, your goods are ready."
-Yeah.
Goods!
What kind of goods?
Where do they come from?
Who are you guys?
I guess you havent recognized us!
"Sir, you had given us rupees five lakh as advance."
And we have kept ready your goods worth 80 lakh!
I think you are forgetting.
I am forgetting!
"Yes, right!"
"So guys, do one thing!"
Just forget about it!
Forget?
"What are you saying, Mr. Adda?"
Mr. Chaddha!
"Mr. Chaddha, dont do this, otherwise we will be ruined!"

We might die also!
-Yeah!
What can I do if you are going to die?
"Its all right, if you cant do anything!"
We want to meet your boss!
-Yeah!

Are you still conscious?
Yeah.
I called them.
Uncle.
Hello uncle.
You should've told me earlier.
I...
Uncle why did you take the trouble?
You should've called me.
What would you like to have?
Black coffee green tea?
Get some water for uncle.
Take a seat don't stand.
Sit.
Sit.
Please.
Ayushman!
What the...
Filmy emotion.
Hit here but the pain's there.
Stop it!
Ayushman!
ACP sir what are you doing?
Get lost.
Listen old man.
Ayushman!
I'm going to skew your son everyday in my jail.
Day-night.
I'll make him suffer slowly.
I'll pressure him to death.
Every time he breathes...
I'll file new charges against him.
I'll make his life hell but won't kill him.
Because people are mistaken about death.
"Yeah, it's okay."
It was nice meeting you.
Likewise.
"You're a very well-behaved young man, you know."
Thanks.
All right.
Veronica.
Virginia?
West Virginia?
Good-bye.
"I never really looked, you know."
I didn't see anything.
That was funny.
Dad!
Hey!
Looks like TV.
Can I use your phone?
The phone's over here.
Where are your parents?
I only have one.
A father.
He's in the T onapiya Wetlands.
What's that?
"Well, this was all once the T onapiya Wetlands."
"He's trying to save the last five acres, but he won't."
Why?
No money.
"He teaches science by day, and, I don't know, tries to save the wetlands by night."
"I admire him, but I pity him, too."
You pity him?
"Well, yeah, his goals aren't realistic."
That's him.
You look like shit.
But your boat looks great.
Yeah.
"I live on my boat, man."
Personal hygiene goes out the window.
A lot of time to work on the place.
BEN:
You should try working on a shower.
NEIL:
Yeah.
"Hey, what can I tell you?"
"Standing on principle, man."
It's all I got.
Cigarette?
"No, I'm good."
"That's right, you quit."
Good for you.
BEN:
So did Janine send you out here to check up on me?
"Yeah, pretty much."
What are you gonna tell her?
I'll tell her how gorgeous you look out here on the ocean.
[LAUGHS]
Break.
Any word from Beth?
"She's so busy organizing her sister's funeral, I think she must be..."
Sister's what?
Her wedding.
Her sister's wedding.
- Isn't that what I said?
- No.
"You said ""funeral."""
Rosalinda...
For your kindness and hard work over so many years...
The penthouse is yours.
Mommy!
Daddy just gave away our house!
"Oh, really?"
Did he?
Who'd he give it to?
Shalom.
"So, I got assigned Rautavaara's ""Piano Sonata No. 2""..."
"- You know, ""The Fire Sermon""?"
"- Yeah, it's wonderful."
Sounds like a piece of cake for you.
Are you kidding me?
- It's the hardest in the canon.
- We'll get together later.
Who's that?
That's Miles.
He's a junior.
"He studies guitar and composition, and he deejays in Chinatown on the weekends."
He's cute.
"Yeah, he's okay."
"Oh, my God."
He's looking over here.
What's wrong with him looking at you?
I don't want him to see me in this.
This outfit is stupid.
You'll freeze to death.
Here.
No.
Easy.
We'll swap.
"- Elizabeth, how are you doing?"
- Fine.
Good.
"Well, we'll catch up downstairs."
- I heard rumors.
"- All true, I'm afraid."
The one face I missed seeing in Recovery.
"I'm so sorry, Robert."
"What, about my arm or about not being there?"
- How are you healing?
- Hurts like a son of a bitch.
You?
Any sensory function yet?
Nope.
It's a motorcycle accident.
I have to go.
I'm sorry.
- Dr. Corday.
How was London?
- Good.
Timed your trip right.
Missed the pox scare we had.
- So I hear.
- How's Ella?
- Fine.
- Is it nice to be back?
I'm off to the ER.
I'll let you know.
Okay.
"Well, good luck."
"- Bite me, panty smellers!"
"- Ma'am, you need to calm down!"
Five years.
Ended a while ago.
No baggage.
"No baggage, love that."
"No baggage, no babies."
Likey. (LAUGHING)
This is fun.
I'm having a fun time in this place.
"And, Wayne, can you tell me how much you make in a fiscal year?"
WAYNE:
Katy!
It's impolite to talk about your money.
He's no slouch.
Okay.
Touche.
"Well, I'm about to begin your story."
"Where maybe one is ""too hard."""
"Maybe one is, um..."
- But in the end...
"- Yeah, you lost him."
He seems...
He seems nice.
Do you live...
Do you live in here?
"So, what did you think of Goldilocks and the Three Dates there, Wayne?"
Ready to fall in Goldi-love?
Or Goldi-lust?
You won't be Goldi-laughin' when I break your Goldi-legs.
Dim the Goldi-lights?
Nights of your Goldi-life?
Use your Goldi-language.
Make her Goldi-laugh.
"- Yes, that's it."
It says:
"""At the foot of the mountain."""
"Hello, why are you late?"
- Why are you late?
- You've been waiting for us?
- Yes.
- Who told you to wait?
My uncle.
"I see, your uncle is..."
Mr Hashemi Masti.
It's a long way to your village... lt's not far!
Not far?
What do you think of your village?
"I've lived here since I was born, I know it."
We're your guests then?
Yes.
Do I turn left here?
- You were waiting for us then?
- Yes.
Since two p.m.
I've been waiting since school finished for the day.
My uncle said:
"""My friends are coming."
"Bring them to the house."""
- Did he say why we've come?
- Yes.
But you mustn't tell anyone.
- All right.
- Good boy.
"If anyone asks, say we're looking for lost treasure."
Good idea.
"Look, would you mind getting out of here?"
Not at all.
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)
"Oh, I'm..."
What is the matter with you?
I'm awfully sorry.
I'm just a little nervous.
"I'm awfully sorry I dropped my suitcase, and I hope I didn't hurt you, mister."
"I'll put all my things back in the suitcase, and I'll get out of your way."
What is this?
(EXCLAIMING)
"Look out, conductors!"
It's the little boy!
Look out!
(SIGHING)
"Oh, geez."
He can't have gone far.
I've got to find him.
CONDUCTOR 1:
You've got to find him?
We've got to find him.
Half-fare!
CONDUCTOR 2:
He must be around here someplace.
Hello.
Goodbye.
The train hasn't stopped.
He couldn't have gotten off.
"What's the matter, son?"
You're trembling.
I have very loose bones.
Are you lost?
You go and save the best for last
Oh!
What's happening?
What's happening is that this is a great song.
"I'll be out here if you need me, Jess."
Jess-Jess.
That's the wizard?
He's wearing a scrunchie.
Looks like he juggles clubs on the beach.
"Yeah, like he'd ever have a job."
Didn't you just kind of assume he'd have a handlebar mustache?
"Come on, Jess, just go in there and get that TV."
"- I miss you, Jess."
- Don't hug him back.
Ugh.
- Ugh.
"- Oh, that's not healthy."
- I told you to water the plants.
- Huh?
Oh.
"Oh, you know it's not my thing."
I told you to water the plants.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
What is she doing?
- Oh!
"- Oh, what a mess."
- I'm coming in!
"- Jess, take your shoes off!"
We keep an Asian household.
Didn't see that coming.
- What are you doing?
Seong-bok.
I think it's the owner.
Seong-bok?
Excuse me.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
What's the matter with you?
Did you get bit?
Huh?
"Say something, dammit."
He's the criminal.
"You're scaring me, man."
Snap out of it.
It wasn't just one or two people.
He took pictures of them when they were alive- and then went back for more when they went crazy and died.
What the hell are you going on about?
He's the criminal.
That's enough.
I'll deal with you later.
I'm sure of it.
He...
He took his victims' belongings and did something with them.
What did you see?
Tell me!
Jeon Hyo-jin
You're getting all wet!
Where is Hyo-jin?
In the living room.
Hyo-jin.
You're home early.
Did you lose your trainer?
"No, Why?"
Why don't you take it?
I don't know.
It was Bennet's.
- I'd feel weird.
- Carrie...
"It's not your fault, what happened to him."
It's Bennet's.
You did a good job.
You should own that.

"Janki, open the door, Janki!"
"I said open the door, Janki!"
Janki!
"Janki, who will support me if you lose hope?"
I know that you are feeling very bad.
You cannot forget the bidding of the auction.
I know.
"Look, Janki.."
Janki.
Janki!
"No, Janki."
No.
Dont do such a thing.
I dont have anyone else besides you.
"If you leave me, then I wont be able to live."
"No, Janki."
Janki!
Janki.
Janki.
Janki!
Sister-in-Iaw!
"No, sister-in-Iaw."
"No, sister-in-Iaw, you cannot leave me!"
"Sister-in-Iaw, I didnt go away from you.."
..so that you leave me forever!
I didnt go to the city to earn so that when..
"..I come back, you dont even talk to me!"
"See, sister-in-Iaw!"
See.. see..
I have brought so many saris for you!
See!
"This pink one, this black one, this red one!"
"Hey, leave Dr. Cicchirini out of this."
He's my boyfriend.
He's an asshole.
"He may be an asshole, but he's my..."
What are you making me say?
"Okay, fine."
"Make the call, but first you should know I did it for you."
Sandro!
"You mean... the Addison's disease,   the fake kidnapping..."
you did that for me?
Yes!
"Meaning,   I'm so important to you that ..."
... that you ...
Yes...
"God, it's cold."
Stop!
"Stop, please!"
"I'm Dr. Cicchirini, can you give me a lift?"
"Hey, slow down."
What happened to you?
I've been robbed!
"16,600 liras, my girlfriend..."
"- Give me a ride, I can't go any farther."
"- Come on, get in."
"My God, what a terrible experience."
Mother of God...
That's the truth!
- What is it?
"- I'm not sure, but that's a serious stench!"
- And it's getting worse!
"- God, yes..."
What a stench!
Who's your favorite player?
"Who's your favorite player, Ben?"
"Hey, come on!"
Who's your favorite?
- Mark Grace.
- Mark Grace?
What?
Are you nuts?
Shawon Dunston's the man.
Best shortstop in the game.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
Next season I'll take you to Wrigley Field.
"Come on, stick with me!"
Stay here.
I'll take you to Wrigley Field....
"Come on, damn it!"
We'll get a couple of dogs then we'll compare Grace to Dunston.
All right?
There you go.
"Hey, stay up!"
Stay awake!
Keep your head up.
Keep your head above water.
All right.
"All right, so you think that you know a lot about baseball, do you?"
Come on.
All right.
Ask me a question.
Come on.
Ask me a tough one.
Let's go.
Stay with me.
"Jesus, baby."
I was talking to that man.
Look at this.
Dude's got a memory blocker.
"Well, that's about all I can do for you, mate."
Time for a reboot.
"See you in about 15 minutes, hopefully."
Hey.
He's awake.
Your eyes might be a bit blurry.
"It's just your depth perception trying to calibrate, yeah?"
"Follow me as I walk, yeah?"
Get up.
Okay.
All right.
- Can you focus on me over here?
- Yeah?
Burying you.
It's like burying treasure.
I really don't understand what Akan is thinking because...
"Henry, stop dicking around."
"You're almost there, mate."
Here's where you gotta get to.
Chop Chop.
Shh.
"It's me, Jimmy."
Move.
"Oh, shit."
Those pigs are here again.
Psst!
Don't compromise my lab.
Let them leave.
There's some cyanosis in his fingers.
- Heart rate...
- 185.
I've gotta tube him.
Scope!
"- I'm here, what's up?"
- Sudden acute respiratory distress.
Looks like trauma to the neck.
Obstructed airway.
- Kid's circling the drain.
- I need the endoscope.
- What?
Why?
"- This temp airway the cops put in,"
I can't take it out.
I gotta intubate through it.
Damn it!
- What's yours for?
- I can't...
No landmarks.
- O2 sats down to 88.
"- Hurry, Jerry!"
- There's too much swelling!
- We don't have time.
"OK, hold on, I think I got it."
ET tube.
- OK great.
Let's get ready...
"- No, sorry."
It's totally closed.
- Heart rate up to 190.
- He needs an airway now.
"Yeah, that's great, yeah."
(moaning)
Mr. Cheng?
Mr. Cheng?
"Mr. Cheng, what troubles you?"
Nothing.
"If nothing, why are you out here alone?"
I'm resting.
"I can't see, but I can listen."
"You never say much, or even laugh."
Right.
I am troubled.
Everyone has some worry.
"You mean, you have troubles?"
Naturally.
Mother's dead.
"I just have an aunt, she is kind, but that's all."
"Actually, you should worry about your eyes."
It's no use.
"Oh, no."
"If you go to the city, find a foreign doctor, maybe you'll see again."
(gasps) Really?
It's the only chance.
Sure.
But where do I find the money?
"Don't worry, when I'm finished here, I'll take you."
Thank you!
"Mr. Cheng, thank you."
[Aunt] Xiao-Mei!
Yes?
[Aunt] The sheriff is leaving.
I'm coming.
I have the package.
"Ground floor, through the library and down the stairs."
- The library.
We're on our way.
- We'll be waiting for you.
That's the library.
Don't go in there.
"Just-- Oh, this is so stupid."
You're not gonna get away with this.
Martin!
What are you doing?
"No, Mr. President."
"The question is, what are you gonna do?"
Gonna shake my hand again?
Give a little speech?
Is this about Kevin?
"Look, I'm sorry--"
"Run, Mr. President!"
"To me, to me, to me!"
Move!
Walker.
"Move, move, move!"
"Let's go, let's go, let's go!"
- Stand behind me and do what I say.
"- Walker, I say again we are coming to you, we are on the move."
In the library.
- Shit.
I'm empty.
- Walker!
"Run, run, run!"
Stenz!
"No, not that way!"
The clinic called.
They said my ass was a perfect match for your hand.
They can start the skin grafts next week.
"Reese, what do you think you're doing?"
-What?
He loves the stuff.
He goes through three or four cans a day.
I don't know how he does it.
Half a can makes me nuts.
Based on true events
"- Well done, Casper."
- Let me have a go.
- Happy with the flat?
"- Yes, two floors."
I love it.
"One floor is Mia's, the other is mine."
"- Splash, Frank!"
The champ.
- I'm off.
- Where to?
- Some sort of lunch at the Gimp's.
- No change in Bodil?
"- No, she's a wreck."
- What's wrong with Bodil?
- She's suffered brain damage.
- Up here?
"- In the brain, yes."
Surprise.
- How did it happen?
- She choked on a giant olive.
- This big.
Have you seen a... wet boy running around here?
He's lost.
And he's truly in a lot of trouble.
"We have witnessed no moist children of the masculine variety gallivanting within these halls, no."
"Oh, hey, Poll."
How's it going?
Oh...
"Hi, Matt."
"You, er, you thought about what I asked you?"
"Yes, actually, I have..."
And?
"All right, you can shag me."
But only once.
You're lucky Bruce is in Guatemala.
Fine.
I'll be around later.
"Can't allow our friends to be naked alone, Matthew."
It's just not cricket.
Got ya...
They're beautiful.
"Oh, thanks."
I do them myself.
Do you?
Yeah.
So you could do me... now?
Sure... if you're up for it.
Does it hurt?
Beautifully.
What are you getting?
A mark...
Passion...
Want...
I don't know.
I just thought.
"Well, you didn't think so good."
How do you know?
Because Burke and I are just friends.
Ok?
Really.
Ok.
You ready for sleep?
Good night.
"Good night, honey."
"Jukebox: ¶ lord, I was born a ramblin' man ¶"
"¶ lord, I was born a ramblin' man ¶"
"it's my mother, tom."
She's alone.
I never should have left her.
"At least in New York, I'd be near."
I'd be close to her.
"I could see about a transfer, Damien."
"I need reassignment, tom."
I want out of this job.
It's wrong.
It's no good.
You're the best we've got.
Am I really?
"It's more than psychiatry, and you know that, tom."
"Some of their problems come down to faith-- their vocation, the meaning of their lives, and I can't cut it anymore."
I need out.
I'm unfit.
"I think I've lost my faith, tom."
Hello?
"Yes, this is Mrs. MacNeil."
Stop!
Stop Mister!
Stop your r!
Hey!
Stop it Mister!
- Are you a part of these items?
- I am extra load!
I was extra load but now I am notll got rid of it!
"Let it be here, I will come back soon!"
- What are your burdens?
"- Those are my burden, can't you see them?"
The burden of misery and adversity!
The burden of cowardice!
What's your relationship with her'?
She is my sister!
- Your sister?
- Yes.
- Your sister?
- Yes.
Hey!
Mister!
Mister!
Officer!
My carfs wheel is there.
It's forbidden.
That's my wheel fell down there.
Go!
Go!
"No entrance, it's forbidden."
Ok!
But it has gone there itself!
"Go, go."
Molly!
She crashed in CT.
Pressure dropped.
Now she's unconscious.
- Said her stomach hurt.
- Could've blown a mesenteric clot.
"Harper, get four units O-neg."
"Stay with us, Ben."
Paddles.
Paddles!
Charging 200.
Clear.
Charging 300.
Clear.
- I got a faint pulse.
- Pulse ox is 80.
He's hypoxic.
Let's change him over to a Shiley.
"Dr. Greene, the press is going berserk."
They want a statement.
We're a little busy right now.
Tell them he's holding his own.
Right.
"Let's get a CBC, lytes, blood gas and coags."
- What's his core temp?
- Eighty-two degrees.
That's too low.
Put him on heated humidified O-2.
Heated saline.
"Let's start him on lidocaine, 0.8 mgs per minute."
Hope he doesn't go back into V-fib.
"Doug, you're a mess."
Samuel's sister.
Ah!
He was in office.
Last night he was working late.
It was bombed.
They have asked me to identify him.
I...
I'm unable.
Mr.Hilliard?
Mr.Hilliard?
"I'm afraid my dear, someone has made a mistake."
I almost did that myself.
"You see Sammy Smith, has two fingers missing from his left hand."
I'm sorry.
We tried very hard to...to make a whole person.
For the relatives.
Is it him?
Is it your friend?
My agent...
Yes.
That's him.
"You can stay with us, if you like."
It's very peaceful.
I'm sure we can make room.
"To Mrs.Cole, Seasonal Greetings."
With very best wishes
- Lily and Rose Starling.
P.S. We hope the film is going well.
"Happy New Year, Mr.Hilliard."
"Sammy, liked the veal, I believe."
Do you also recommend it?
It's not veal in the pre-war sense.
You're married!
There's always something dragging you back.
What was he after?
Nothing.
You don't know him?
No.
Good.
And thanks for doing the riding hat.
Get me out of bother.
Who have you spotted now?
Mr Tubby.
"Aw, he's walking away all sad."
Will you not just have a butty with him?
No!
Yoo-hoo!
Tubby!
She's changed her mind.
She will have lunch with you - next Monday in the square.
Bring a yoghurt!
Sorry!
Pauline!
He's lovely...!
"Straight to the top of the stairs and quietly, please!"
Quiet.
Quiet!
"I shall be checking hands, faces, boots, and hair ribbons."
"The Halle Orchestra looks smart, so must we."
"Baker, come here."
You... are a chump.
What are you?
"I'm a chump, sir."
If Miss Riall had seen you in that state that would have been it.

It was a set up.

That was an ambush!

"Hey, you really saved us from getting wiped out."
"Why, King Triton!"
[Chuckles] How are you?
- Let her go!
- Not a chance!
She's mine now!
- We made a deal.
"- Daddy, I'm sorry!"
I-I...
I didn't mean to!
I didn't know!
[Ursula laughs]
You see?
"The contract's legal, binding and completely unbreakable, even for you."
"Of course, I always was a girl with an eye for a bargain."
The daughter of the great sea king is a very precious commodity.
But I might be willing to make an exchange for someone even better.
"Eric, what are you doing?"
"Grim, I lost her once."
I'm not gonna lose her again!
"Now, do we have a deal?"
Ha!
It's done then!
- [Ursula laughs]
- No!
"Oh, no!"
Your Majesty.
Daddy.
- At last... it's mine.
- No.
- [Cackles]
- You!
You monster!
"I don't think I can drink any more water, Howard... especially with this belt."
What's that got to do with it?
"Well, I have to go to the bathroom, and I..."
- can't stand up.
"- Oh, honey."
Bob's gotta go to the... bathroom.
Excuse us.
"- Honey, you okay?"
"- Oh, oh."
"Oh, oh."
Shh.
Quiet.
- Surprise!
- For he's a jolly good fellow
For he 's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny
- Speech.
"- Speech, speech, speech."
All right.
"This, I'll have to admit this really was a surprise, and I-"
"I wanna tell you how much I appreciate it, but-"
- Aw.
- I really have to go to the bathroom.
"- Uh, Emily?"
- What?
How do I look?
"Oh, I love the pants."
But the jacket doesn't match.
"No, no."
I lost two inches around my waist.
"Oh, Bob."
I will investigate it all.
What's this?
- We found something.
- Come here.
This...
"What do you think this is, Team Leader Song?"
When you choke someone by the neck...
Seo Jun Seok and President Hwang's... necks?
Tell Im Tae Ho to come out here!
Wait a minute.
What is that?
That wasn't in our car before!
Sir.
"This is what I think, in all seriousness."
"There are times when you must run away, even when you did nothing wrong."
"I think that's your best move, to make some time for yourself."
Honey.
"You trust me, right?"
Take good care of the kids.
"Hey, hey, hey!"
"Look, look, look!"
Look over there!
Go catch him!
Oh...
Hey...
- What are you doing?
- Let go of me!
Let go!
Will you be okay?
Are you okay?
- Come here!
- Hey!
When did I?
!
You gave it to Jai.
And Jai...
I get it.
It's between us.
Why drag Jaiprakash into this?
"All right, Hari..."
what's wrong?
Your touch has awoken the music in me!
That's the background score.
Who was playing it?
It happens in emotional scenes.
Was it the radio?
I've got to give you some news.
"Your husband is dead, isn't he?"
But don't worry...
"I'm willing to marry a ""window""!"
Window?
Aren't you a window now?
!
It's Widow; not window.
Never mind!
But we will still meet!
No.
We will not.
Two gardeners and a rose.
What?
!
Don't look back.
But that man there...
The chap with the blue shorts?
"Allison, if you get hurt while I'm busy with some stupid test, someone's going to need to take care of me."
-lf he does anything...
-Like?
Anything weird or bizarre...
Anything.
Anything evil!
(sighs)
Jackson?
Did you still want to discuss your paper?
"You have one hour, Mr. McCall."
Begin.
(sighs)
(SCOFFS)
"Really, Scott?"
I can't.
(sighs) I gotta do this.
I gotta do this.
"No, I am gonna go to work."
I am gonna go to work.
I am just gonna straighten up.
Just a little bit.
Just a tad.
He won't even know I was here.
(MELLOW ROCK SONG playing)
(TlCKlNG)
You just scared the hell out of me.
"Sorry, I..."
"I was just, I was..."
Nothing.
That's a...
Nice heels.
"Yeah, my feet were hurting, so I..."
Meet me at Omar's.
Be ready for me.
I'm going after that truck.
How?
I don't know.
I'm making this up as I go.
Ew!
He's there!
Idiot!
Idiot!
Everything at last has been arranged.
The Ark?
Is on board.
"Nothing is lacking, now that you're here."
Or what is left of you.
You trust these guys?
Yes.
Mr. Katanga.
"Mr. Katanga, these are my friends."
They are my family.
I will hear of it if they are not treated well.
My cabin is theirs.
Mr. Jones...
"I've heard a lot about you, sir."
Your appearance is exactly the way I imagined.
Good-bye.
Look out for each other.
I am already missing you.
You're my good friend.
Sallah.
That is for Fayah... that is for your children... and this is for you.
Thank you.
My God!
Now look... hear me out!
"Yawning like a princess, eh?"
Aren't you ashamed?
What is this?
A finger.
What else?
Acting smart!
Here goes...
That's one finger.
How many are these?
Two.
And how many are these?
Your finger is swollen!
Naturally!
I gave you a blow!
But I won't spare you...
Why are awakening me only to hit me?
Will you realise it if you're bashed up unconscious?
That explains it!
No!
Call the police!
You're an ill-mannered man!
No!
What are you up to?
!
The poor man will die!
He teases women in our area!
What nonsense?
!
I'm glad you've come!
Save me from this bear!
Look at my face!
- What's it called?
"- Oh, God."
Perspirex.
"Hello, it's Marco."
Remember me?
Of course.
- How are you?
- Naked.
I should buy some clothes.
This is all I have.
I could go to your house and get what you need.
"No, I don't want anything from there."
Maybe later.
- Where are we going?
- To Sybilla.
- You must think I'm mad.
- Why?
- I don't ever want to go back home.
"- No, I understand."
"When we broke up,"
I couldn't carry on sleeping in the same bed.
- I slept on the couch.
- Yeah?
"I did that for over a week, until I decided to buy a new bed."
So you're single.
I'm alone.
SEVERAL MONTHS LATER
We have to talk after the fight.
- We've been talking for an hour.
- You.
Not me.
- It's totally fine.
"Come on, get in the car."
- It's Ryan Gosling.
Come on.
- This is gonna be amazing.
"- I assure you, it's just fine and dandy."
"- He invited us, sweetheart."
- Can we stop by my house?
I don't really wanna be wearing this.
- You look fine.
- You look like schoolgirls.
"- Hey, let's go shopping."
"- Oh, my gosh."
This is amazing.
"Okay, Grace, you have the coolest mom in history."
- Ryan Gosling.
"- Oh, my gosh."
Aah!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
"Wait, wait, what did he say?"
"""Absolutely."
"We'll be here working all night long."""
"I said, ""Really?"
"It's okay if we come by?"""
"He said, ""Yeah, we're just rehearsing now."""
- Ohh.
"- Uh, um..."
- What are these?
- She doesn't know what they are.
Ha-ha-ha.
They're goldfish.
"I know what a goldfish is, but why do you have goldfish in your car?"
[ Voice breaks ] They kicked me out.
"I ended up going to this mansion party that was, like, a thousand times better all-nighter."
"But still, I didn't get to dance at my prom."
I never knew.
I'm so...
[ Sighs ] 28?
Really?
He was 28?

Ooh!
They may need a hose!
"Hey, Jules, maybe we should hang back."
"You know, like, give the kids some space."
They love us.
We saved prom.
"Also, we're super fun."
I think the kids can sense that.
It's kinda like how dogs can hear loud whistles.

[ Cheering ]
Dance circle.

"Uh, no, thanks."
I'm good.
"I'm not really cut out for a dance circle, so..."
- Can't believe I got all my stuff back.
"- You did, but most of it's broken."
"Yeah, it's broken, but, I don't know, it's mine."
"Yeah, but it's broken."
"Hey, look at that."
I think it's working.
"- Oh, my God!"
- We got a TV again.
- It's a TV and it's working!
"- Hey, we got the TV back!"
All right.
You guys are awesome.
I'm gonna make you so much jam.
"- Please, don't."
"- Oh, we're gonna have ajam sess."
Absolutely not.
"- Okay, what are we watching?"
- I have some DVDs.
"Adventures in Babysitting, Prancer, Newsies, Curly Sue."
- I'm going out.

Wait.
Where are you guys going?
These are heartwarming films.

"Even if you have 2 guns, how many of us can you shoot?"
"Before we fight, sign the contract first."
You two go!
It was a misunderstanding.
Sorry.
Misunderstanding?
You made me lose face.
Put down your gun.

"Michael, call the ambulance."
Oh no.
I will take the first flight tomorrow.
Any news in the papers and I leave.
"Go, police is coming."

He is stable.
You can go to see him.
I want to tell you
"I did my best to stop them, Judge Travis."
"Now, I can see that, Litefoot."

"Come on, let's go, boys."
Stand him up.
"No, bring him on this mule."
"Come on, get him up there."

That's it.
That's right.
You get to go see the Lord.
"All right, get the rope up over there."
Get up there.
All right.

"Baby, we have good energy."
We have a good energy me and you no?
Yes.

Just stay here.
Who is that JP?
"Ah, computer is broken"
Is crazy joke ha ha...

A drink?
No thanks.

You have a video that can give me a sense of what goes on there.
It will take more than a video to show you that.
Meaning?
Bombay has over a million child prostitutes.
Four or five times that suffer from malnutrition.
They're not on the video.
Then there are those who die every day of...

So George has caught another butterfly.
Why shouldn't he fall in love with her?
He hasn't fallen in love.
He has succumbed to her.
The poor man was simply standing there and was crushed under her wheels.
It's not too late.
"Franz, you must go over at once and talk to him."
Please.
Excellent.

"Well, I'm sure it doesn't matter."
You seem to have plenty of company.
What do you mean?
"If I were you, I'd stay on this train and keep going."
What are you...
Oh!
Oh!
"Oh, I'm so sorry."
You're sorry.
Oh.
"Well, Gretchen, what happened to you?"
I found Nancy.
"What'd you do, have breakfast with her?"
I think you better not go in there.
Why?
"Well, she's sharing her drawing room with a man."
Nancy?
He was in bed when I walked in.
"Oh, there's some mistake."
"Yes, there's a mistake all right, and Nancy's made it."
"Gretchen, I think you've said about enough."
"Well, I saw him!"
You coming?
No.

"Michael, I can talk to Ellington."
Watch.
"Man, this is crazy."
You barked.
The dog barked.
"Trippin', Jeff."
That's right.
You can't hear me talk to Ellington.
"Michael, something happened to me."
I can touch a book and for thirty seconds... know and do everything in the book.
"I mean, grab any book in this house."

Where is he?
Ricky doesn't have to follow us everywhere.
- What did Rosa say?
- To come.
You're more hysterical than her.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Why didn't you invite me along?
That was very unkind of you.
You want to know who your father is.
Good for you.
Really.
"But I want to know, too."
"I want to know who raised you, who was with you all your lives."
I won't hold you up.
Have some tea and go.
It seems Aunt Rosa has something to say that I thought you should hear.

"And I could tell by looking at your gait, your muscles remember."

- It's okay.
- Get some techs in here.

She sidled up to me.
- What?
I was scared!
"Only so much space, and there she was with me"
Then?
- Then what?
She was lost in my eyes
He was after my eyes.
Wouldn't shut up.

He's canceling my fitting for the dog costume.
He didn't say what it's 'bout.
"Tell him, ""he can find me""."

You'll get Amelian!
"(A million) ln that case, I won't say anything!"
- What?
Bring him Amelian!
But I didn't mean nobody to get killed.
Quit stalling.
Who paid ya to do it?
Hanley and Grayce.
How did you frame him?
I socked his head.
Then planted the liquor in the car.
Yeah.
Then started the car and then jumped out.
"Yeah, I did, but I didn't mean to have nobody get killed."

[Smacks lips] Mmm!
- Is he rich?
- Does it matter?
I don't know.
Does it matter to you?
"If it mattered, I'd be with him, and I'm not."
I'm with you.
[Laughs]
I told my friends about you.
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.
What did you say?
- That you're crazy...
- [Laughs]
And that I'm having a sexual awakening with you.
Wow.
A sexual awakening.
I told them that I've never come so much in my life.
[Laughs]
"Oh, wait a second."
Even more than with Paul?
- Way more than Paul.
- Yeah.
Paul was too big.
I couldn't take it unless I was really drunk.
What's wrong?
"We all spend so much time, energy AND money in an effort to look our best."
We all WANT to be attractive.
Hello.
"Hello, Rose, it's Alex."
Oh!
"Hi, Alex."
How... how are you?
"Oh, I'm okay, I'm... trying to get on with my life, ya know."
"Oh, good, good."
What's wrong with you?
You don't...
Claire's gone.
Gone?
Yeah.
Gone where?
I came home to surprise her during lunch and I found her in bed with her masseur.
"It's my own fault, really..."
Claire hates surprises.
"Alex, I'm..."
I'm really sorry.
"No, no, I knew it was coming."
I don't know WHY she wasn't happy.
I...
I...
I don't know how I could have loved her any more than I did.
I don't think it would've mattered how much you loved her.
- Rose.
- Uh-huh.
Did you know that Claire was jealous of you.
- What!
Jealous of me?
"- Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yes.."
we can only...!
I understand!
Come here to the front!
Pilaf sama!
Mai!
It is that all this is so ...
Shu!

But we saw nothing.
Are you sure they were together the 7 Dragonballs?

Hu-Flee!
Shark idiot!

I thought you were going to die!
Be careful not to fall!
Oi!

We came by....
We came to shoot scenes for a drama!
And where are the cameras?
Well that... you can eat!
Today is my mother's birthday
There are many stalls too!
Can we?
!
Except both!
I do not want to receive favors from anyone!
Hold it.
Hold it.
"- Say, ""Thankyou, Snookie."""
"- Thankyou, Snookie."
Get your ass on the floor.
"Ticket, please."
Have a good trip.
"Excuse me, is this seat taken?"
No.
I love ballet.
I never had the body for it.
You dance?
I used to.
I've got something for you.
"It's for love, not luck because you don't need luck."
You dance like an angel.
Mom...
You're the best luck I'll ever have.
- Are you okay?
- I keep messing up the pirouettes.
"It's frustrating, but it'll be okay."
My mom's gonna be there.
You have nothing to worry about.
You're the best dancer in Lamont.
"This is not Lamont, it's Julliard, New York City."
- Do you want to pray?
- What?
You're leaving for St. Louis.
I'm not gonna see you.
We should pray.
"Awesome Father, S.J. Auditions today, let her do okay..."
Hello?
Over here.
Is this your house?
It was.
I'll tell you all about it.
"But first, did you bring the flower?"
I couldn't find it.
That's okay.
"But since you don't have it,"
I'm gonna need that kiss.
(ELECTRO BALLAD playing)
(SHUDDERS)
Is something wrong?
(LYDlA SCREAMS)
Pull her up.
Is she dying?
"She might, I..."
Which is why this is gonna hurt.
-(BONE breaking) -(screaming)
You broke her arm!
It'll trigger the healing process.
I still gotta get the venom out.
This is where it's really gonna hurt.
Stiles...
You make a good Batman.
"Oh, my God."
You know who it is.
Jackson.
"You just wanted Erica to confirm it, didn't you?"
I'm gonna help you stop him.
As part of your pack.
"If you want me in, fine."
Or was it all of you?
"Was it you, Jones?"
Was it you?
Was it you?
Or was it you?
"You sick bastard, you're imagining things again!"
Oh yeah?
"You've been fishing with Ivan lately, Reynolds?"
How's that...
How's that tuna biting?
Let me see you talking your way out of this one!
Where is it?
Christ!
"What the fuck now, Reznik?"
Get him off me!
"You're through, you fuck!"
Pick up your shit and get the fuck out of here.
You're fired.
This motherfucker's crazy.
"You lost it, man."
Shit!
Damn it!
Where is it?
Asshole!
What the fuck did you do with it?
Idiot!
Hey!
Fuck you!
Get out!
What?
It's an occupational hazard.
"So, Trevor, are you gonna rescue me from this miserable life or what?"
- Give me two cards.
- It's good for 80000.
I can only get 1500 from the ATM.
I'll transfer the balance and add 2000 for your trouble.
Did your mum drop you as a baby?
I don't want 4500 in the bank.
I am on welfare.
So get another card or go elsewhere.
- Give me yours.
- Mine's behind the bar.
I need it.
Wait here.
Back to the Edge.
Out of the car!
- What are you doing with Yugo Danny?
- Nothing.
What's this?
- ID.
ID.
- In my right-hand pocket.
Alexander Seeberg?
Judge Seeberg's son?
- Did you hurt your footsie?
- Just come along.
Not with you.
You and your partner broke my rib last time.
See you in court.
Can I see your watch again?
How much did you say it cost?
25000.
- How about going somewhere else?
- Right.
Dori!
Dori!
"Dori, you're here."
Why is he here?
Do you know this dog?
"Yes, he's Dori."
Somebody abandoned him.
Do you know the owners?
"Yes, I've seen them here before."
They abandoned him?
"Yes, I think so."
I couldn't find the owners.
So my uncle decided to raise him.
Really?
That's terrible.
How could they abandon Dori?
That's his name?
Yes.
"We didn't know, so we named him Ocean."
"Oh, you did?"
"Dori, what's happened to you?"
Will you keep him?
"Yes, my uncle is fond of dogs."
And he's just a little puppy.
That's better for him.
Huh?
It's better than being raised in Seoul.
"Dori, are you alright?"
Do you like it here?
Don't you miss your owner?
Some owners they are for ditching him.
The crazy bastards.
You speak my mind.
Well done.
Come on.
An enquiry.
"- Yes, Sir."
Before 18th of September...
Did this guy stay here?
"No, Sir."
Are you sure?
Or do you want confirm with someone else?
I'm sure.
He is not our guest.
"Panju, this is where I stay."
Please come.
Do you know him?
No.
Take a closer look.
He was staying here.
I'm sure that he didn't stay here.
How are you so sure?
I never forget any guest's face.
I can even remember a guest who stayed with us 10 years ago.
Do you know him?
No.
Give the key for room number 205.
Why?
He is staying here.
Give the key.
We are investigating trusting people like this!
Come.
He was staying here for a while.
What happened to him?
For sure.
Bye.
Drake set it up for Saturday.
Sweet.
Good.
Now I can get some sleep.
What?
man-- that guy has been calling me every night wanting to know when it's gonna happen.
he hit me up like three times today.
He's freaking crazy.
Stop for a minute.
What?
This boy Erin's seeing-- do you know anything about him?
Yeah.
He's-- he's new in town.
He works for Garret.
He's a fighter?
I guess so.
Could you deal with him?
I already have once.
smartass.
Yeah.
Why?
The word's up somebody's trying to book him some big money fights.
I was thinking of bringing some of my friends in.
l want to make sure you can take this guy.
Set it up.
This is it?
What the fuck were you expecting?
It's a private bout.
Come on.
This should be interesting.
"All right, but aren't you the guide?"
Are you ennoyed?
"Not ""ennoyed"", ""annoyed""!"
Annoyed?
"Not yet, but if you carry on, I soon will be."
"Welcome, engineer."
Hello.
- We're honoured.
- The honour's mine.
This is it.
Welcome.
This is one of the rooms.
What did she say?
"If it's too small, there are other rooms."
"Thank you, we'll only be staying a couple of nights."
Make yourself at home.
This is the bathroom.
Another bedroom...
That's good.
Thank you.
- Where's the old lady's house?
- Who?
- The lady who's ill.
- You mean Malek?
"Yes, son."
She lives over there.
You can see it from the roof.
- Which way?
- This way.
- Can we see it from here?
- Yes.
See that blue window?
"I'm telling you, asshole, to get your ass out there!"
For crying out loud...
"Okay, I'll go."
"Come on, hurry!"
Shit.
Who the fuck are you?
What the hell?
"Stop, goddamn it!"
"Stop it, you dirty slut!"
You whore!
"Eat this, too."
"Amn, you're heavy."
I'm getting too old for this.
Don't be ridiculous.
Old ladies tell me men can still get it up after 70.
Then buy me some herbal supplements.
I keep having fucked-up nightmares.
What're you doing in there?
Oh hell.
Shit!
Nothing!
Get away from the car.
- Don't open it!
- What are you doing?
For crying out loud!
Dad!
Dad?
Look.
How do I look?
Pretty.
Freakishly pretty.
How long were you watching?
Meaning what?
Meaning nothing comes out of the mirror unless something goes back in.
Really?
And I am done... with that.
I beg to freaking differ.
Freak.
I suppose I should have destroyed that mirror when I had the chance.
Turn around.
This is on you.
You're the one who set me free.
"Well, I'm fixing that right now."
Turn around.
"Oh, my..."
I am never going back into that mirror.
Do you hear me?
Never.
And this.
This is my ace.
That's it.
Cash me out.
Curiouser and curiouser.
"Artie, now!"
"Pete, help me."
"Artie, where is Myka?"
- Thank you.
"- Yeah, you're welcome."
All right.
"Here, let's get this."
- So what now?
- Now...
Now we move Alice to the dark vault.
- What's the dark vault?
Run!
Don't let them catch you!
"Jeffrey, run!"
The cops are afteryou!
Freeze!
"Jeffrey, the cops are all around!"
The cops are everywhere!
Run!
"Jeffrey, run away!"
"It's me,Jenny."
Don't move!
Let's go.
"What's wrong, officer?"
Flirting isn't a crime.
Arrest him!
"Keep clear, everyone."
Let me through.
Open those suitcases.
- What were you doing at the airport?
- Chasing a piece ofass.
What's yourjob?
I'm a casting agent for movie companies.
- But you resisted arrest!
- I was drunk.
Stand up and walk a straight line!
- Where's your friend?
- What friend?
You know who.
He's in grave danger.
Help him.
Tell me where he is.
I want to help him solve his problem.
We all had that.
Why can't they have that?
I don't know.
"There, did you see that?"
- What?
- That guy.
- People are looking at me.
- That's good.
They're looking at me.
"Oh, they're looking at you."
H i.
H i.
See?
Now what was that about?
- He said hi?
- That was not hi.
- That was hi.
- That was a different hi.
That was a he wants to get to know you hi.
From someone who never talks to me has never talked me...
and would never talk to me.
Except now he thinks you put out so he talks to you.
"- See, I told you that note was good."
- Rayanne.
Maybe Jordan started the rumor.
Don't be ridiculous.
It's a very guy thing to do.
- Hey Catalano.
- Hey.
"So, what about this gun thing?"
I would hate to be that soda bottle.
Splat.
"Don't worry, boss, I will."
[Rustling]
[Toilet flushing]
[Gasping]
Charlie!
Tommy!
"Hey, you!"
"I know you're out there, somewhere!"
What are you doin'?
"What the hell are you doin', huh?"
"What the... oh, Jesus Christ, no, no."
"Hey, look..."
"Hey, listen, pal."
"Wait a minute, wait a minute!"
I wanna talk to you.
I wanna talk to you...
look.
"What are you doing, huh?"
"Listen, who hired you..."
Who hired you?
What are you doin'?
"Wait a minute, wait a minute."
"You're not gonna get away with it, you hear me?"
"Holy shit... what are you, crazy, or something?"
"Hey-hey, you don't wanna fucking talk to me?"
What are you doin'?
"Hey, leave that alone, huh?"
"Oh, Jesus Christ, hold it... take it easy."
"Don't do it, don't do it."
"Hold it... no, no, no."
Holy shit.
"Holy... hey, wait a minute."
It's just scars.
Chicks dig scars.
I love scars.
Now here we go.
"Oh, wonderful."
You're doing very good.
What?
"What's that, Larry?"
Really?
You want to take our love to the next level?
"Well, I..."
"The setting's a little strange, but..."
"Well, I suppose we wouldn't be the first star-crossed lovers to make love in a crypt."
"Oh Larry, I accept."
Oh-ohhhhh!
Oomph!
"No, not there."
Maybe it's here.
"No, it's never there."
There's no murder weapon anywhere.
"Come on, Marnie, you're looking for a remote control."
Suspicious.
What is?
Just a second Ricky.
Jumbo panties!
Excuse me.
Aahhh!
I've been caught.
What are you doing with my panties?
What should I do?
"S-say you're a panty fiend, sorry."
"Sorry, I'm a panty fiend."
Is he seeing somebody?
- Why are you asking me?
- Just tell me the truth.
"Is he seeing somebody else, Chris?"
Look at me!
I'm looking at you.
I don't know if he's seeing anybody else.
You don't know.
How could you not know?
I don't know anything.
Hey.
This is Michael.
- Leave a message...
- What is with the yelling?
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.
Jenna!
"Michael, call me as soon as you get this message."
I'm gonna kill you.
"Oh, my God!"
What the hell are you doing?
You're calling him?
"- No, that wasn't him."
- To tell him what?
What is this?
- What the fuck is this?
- I honestly have no fucking idea.
"- Yes, you do."
Do you know her?
- Just give me a break.
"- No, I don't."
- Do you know her?
"Thank you, Roko."
"Look at it, a real champion."
- Thank you.
- No problem.
"Come on, folks!"
Come and get it!
"Hello, 13 Ribarska St."
What do you say?
"Out here, all the fish is as big as this one."
"I'd like to ask you something, if I can..."
"No, you can't."
What devil brings you here?
Praise the Lord.
Now and forever.
"It was opened, so I came in for a prayer."
Do you need any help?
"Thank you, my child."
I'm done.
Sister...
I'd like to give a donation to your church... if I may.
You may... of course you may.
We pass this on to the Child Care Centre.
Here.
My child...
Thank you.
On behalf of them.
What brings you here?
"Have you come alone, or..."
I'm alone.
My child...
"If you need anything, just ask."
"Thank you, Sister."
"Because I do not know whether night is a dream, and he hates me, and now he's going to give me to them like he did with the others."
They are going... to sacrifice me to the demons!
- It's all right.
It's all right.
You're just imagining things.
Everything is going to be okay.
- What the devil is going on in here?
!
"- My apologies, ma'am."
This poor girl is clearly suffering from some kind of delusional attack.
- Lucy... you cannot hurt me.
- I can.
I will!
- You can't.
Gunther.
No!
Let go of me.
The wolves!
The wolves!
No!
The wolves...
"- Thank you, sir."
Porter.
- Detective Thomas.
Good to see you.
- How're you doing?
Good to see you.
- I'm good.
I'm good.
"Please, sit."
- Sure.
- How are you?
"Since you have been decided, will you go with me also."
Ah...yes.
We go.
Lets go.
"Yet this traffic, no longer can be crossed."
It is truth.
Slowly...
-Sandro?
you have bound?
"-No, it is that I..."
-What you do?
"We go, we go, lady."
Where you are going to look for them?
In the day-care center?
The very ready one!
You accompanied her to house?
"Eh, boys, Prof. Cicchirini has bought a new car."
-No.
-That yes.
-I do not create it to me.
-If you I to it say.
We are going to let pass this opportunity?
No.
"Boys, a question:"
Which can be the car of Cicchirini?
I believe that it is the one with the canvas.
Bravo!
Right answer.
"-Goodbye, mother."
-Paulino.
Mother.
"I must go to me, we see you behind schedule this?"
"Yes, I'm going to the fields to get my things."
Where's the engineer from?
Tehran or Hamadan?
"Get up, you've slept enough, you layabouts."
"Get up, I've brought fresh apples."
This is for Ali and this one for Keyvan.
- Hello.
"- Hello, are you well?"
I have some fresh bread for you.
- What is it?
- Bread.
We have fresh bread.
What more can you want?
You won't have another chance like this.
This is for me.
The big apple is for uncle Jahan.
How about that!
This isn't Jahan's apple.
I think it's yours.
"Yes, yes, it's coming."
Here.
All right.
- Have you had your share?
- Yes.
Where are you going?
To school.
- To school?
- Yes.
Do you have time to show us the village?
"No, I have exams."
I'll go with you to school.
All right.
-And I went up.
"-Son, we are penguins"
-We can not fly.
-But Sven is a penguin.
"I do not know what type of penguin Sven is, but penguins are"
"Emperor, we can not ..."
-If I learn to fly
Mom can get out of there.
I do not know if there is a way out.
"Erik, surely, is not flying."
If you want you must desire and if you want
-What is your wish!
"-Erik, get real."
They are trapped.
They are hungry and afraid.
The last thing we need is false hope.
-Boys?
-Then all will die.
"Boys, what's the problem with you two?"
It's just a conversation.
-Erik?
We need a mother's love.
It will explode.
"Dude, why will not catch a few more fish?"
"He is not hungry, Aunt Gloria."
"Yeah beauty, Atticus, I know, I understand."
I'm going fishing.
"Erik, stop with this anger."
"Calm down, Erik."
"Honey, take a step back."
Close your eyes ...
Take a deep breath ...
John.
I want you to be happy.
What?
"This is your wake-up call, Mr. Klein."
I didn't ask for a wake-up call.
"What happened to you, Mr. Klein?"
Yes.
I can't believe I got through.
"Gordon, where are you, man?"
Speak up.
"Listen, John, he was right."
Mr. Cold was right about everything.
Right?
Right about what?
I can't hear you.
He was right about understanding.
"It's real, John."
I want you to know.
It's real
What is...
What are you talking about?
You've got nothing to worry about.
I'll see you in time.
Gordon?
Gordon!
Can they tell how long he was out there?
Looks like he's been dead about eight hours.
He died of exposure.
What made you come out here?
- He called me.
- When?
I didn't like the way he sounded.
He was good.
"He was very, very good."
"Señor, nobody has come out of there alive..."
Please.
Señor!
Stop.
Stay out of the light.
Forrestal.
Let us hurry.
There is nothing to fear here.
That's what scares me.
Stay here.
If you insist Señor.
Give me the whip.
Throw me the idol.
No time to argue.
"Throw me the idol, I throw you the whip."
Give me the whip.
Adios señor.
Adios stupido.
Dr. Jones.
Again we see there is nothing you can possess which I can not take away.
And you thought I'd given up.
You choose the wrong friends.
This time it will cost you.
"Too bad the Hovitos don't know you the way I do, Belloq."
Yes.
Too bad.
You could warn them...
if only you spoke Hovitos.
"Jock, start the engine!"
Get it up!
Be in the moment?
Programs!
Anybody need programs?
"Buy it now, buy it now."
Programs.
Programs.
Programs.
"Hey, you want a program, man?"
- Thanks.
I'm good.
- Cool.
I got ice cream.
Anyone?
Want ice cream?
"- No, I'm good."
"- Ice cream, guys."
Who's--who's hungry?
Ice cream?
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Meeting Dave.
What are you doing here?
"Well, Dave gave me this ticket and told me to meet him here."
- What a jerk.
"- Well, look, I have zero intention of sitting here with you all night, so..."
Fine.
It's cool.
I'll watch the game by myself.
No way.
I'm gonna watch the game by myself.
No.
"If you're going in, I'm going in."
They're no way that you're gonna go in.
"God bless the moon, and God bless me"
And God bless the somebody
I'd want to see
God looked down from up above
And he picked you out for me to love
He picked you out from all the rest
'Cause he knew that I loved you the very best
I see the moon and the moon sees me
And the moon sees somebody I'd want to see
God bless the moon and God bless me
And God bless the somebody I'd want to see
Good morning.
Hey.
Sit down.
Thanks.
Guess what.
What?
I'm pregnant.
You're kidding.
Never more serious.
Wow.
"Oh, uh..."
Are you happy?
Yeah!
Are you happy?
I think so.
"Yeah, I think I am."
Sit down.
Should you sit down?
"I'm only two months along, I'm fine."
"Oh, my God."
A baby.
Straight ahead.
Turn left.
"Your kind of party, huh?"
I was never in a fraternity.
I was much too serious.
I bet you were 29 even when you were 19.
Put it this way.
"If I had to do it again,"
"I'd do it knowing that after you graduate, no one ever gives a fuck what your GPA was."
Hey!
Kim!
Hi!
"This is Sara, and Bridgitte and John."
- Hey.
How's it going?
- Cool.
Sorry about that.
"At the tone, please record your message."
"Chris, it's Jenna."
Michael and you both have your cell phones off.
"Listen, Izzy's dad just died."
"We're all gonna head over there, so I guess I'll see you guys there."
Bye.
Go ahead.
I'll be okay.
"- I want things to be okay, Daddy."
- I know.
Go ahead.
Take care of your friend.
I'm fine.
I really am.
You have no messages.
"- Excuse me, Jesse."
I've got to run.
- Have a great day.
"- Have yourself a ""morning air"" day."
- I will.
Filthy rich.
Let's call a spade a spade and a chicken a chicken.
"Julie, call me the minute that Peter Rickman is out of the OR."
- The very minute.
"- Yes, Dr. James."
Perhaps you can get me an update on Hook's progress.
"Yes, Dr. James."
"Okay, Elmer, there it is."
A three-pound universe.
What do you know?
Go back to sleep.
Elmer.
That nurse down there is no longer dancing to the sound of the Big Brass Band.
"Would you mind squirreling her away in a corner, please?"
Thank you.
What the hell did you just do?
I don't know.
How the hell should I know?
I'm just the dog.
Hook.
Yeah.
"Just slow down, Otto."
I'm on my way.
"Mrs. Rickman, I assure you..."
- Are you my husband's doctor?
- That would be Hook.
He was on call when Mr. Rickman was admitted.
(Laughing)
You try it.
"Come on, Michael, it don't hurt."
Give me your hand.
Mete Tu mano right there.
"Watch that, the water."
"Yeah, just like..."
Hold it right there.
"Wait for him, wait for him."
Ah!
You see that?
Yeah.
Bites.
Told you.
"Hey, um..."
"And thank you too, for sending me those pictures..."
While I was up north.
I don't know if I thanked you for that.
You're welcome.
Stop.
Just make sure you don't ride the clutch too much.
"You want to give her a break every once in a while,"
So she can last.
You pay for all this.
Otherwise you'll be back spending your money.
(Angela) Thank you.
You're welcome.
"(Hector) Manny, it's okay, papa, I'll close her out."
You sure?
"Yeah, esta bien."
(Radio playing music)
(Dance music on television)
Do you have children ...
Appear in your profile.
"All have a profile, right?"
"On ""Com all2gethr.""."
"Take a good, I saw the picture marriage is crazy."
And i. .. beautiful
I'm sorry.
That was three years ago.
Naughty girl ...
Naughty.
- Is it for your friends.
- Who cares?
It seems very friendly ...
"Do not worry with it, getting married next month."
"Really, who benefits?"
"So, something about you, Mr darkness ..."
- About me?
- Yes.
You do not need to profile even photos.
What can I say?
Hold them for me.
We waited in rare cases.
"Well, for me, is in order."
Damn.
And say once again.
Hey ... empty.
Let ...
Thank you.
That's all right.
This from the host ...
Hey!
We are ready to go.
There you go.
"This beautiful, exquisite, amazing..."
Uh...!
What?
What?
Um...
Did you know that you have a thing
- What?
- on... on your back?
Like a...
like a freckle?
Like a mole.
Is it gross?
"It's,uh,um..."
It's pretty big.
You need a doctor to look at this.
"Okay,yeah,um, you know what?"
"Uh,we should get out."
Come on.
You know what I want to do?
I want to go on the computer and check out one of those medical sites.
"I mean,I'm sure that it's nothing, but I'm gonna worry about it until I know for sure."
How could such an ugly mole end up on such a foxy lady?
Nature screwed up.
Come on.
Thank you for being so sweet to me.
Why wouldn't I be?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I hurt you.
Come on.
Bella?
Hey.
Don't hurt me.
Please.
Please.
Call her.
What?
Your mother.
Hello?
Mom?
Is that you?
"Are you all right, sweetheart?"
"I want to come home, Mom."
Keep it going.
Keep it going.
You will.
"You will, soon."
But first I need to explain to you why I wasn't there to protect you.
What are you talking about?
It wasn't your fault that--
Yes.
"Yes, it was."
I need to explain to you why I did the things I did.
"I have an addiction, and it kept me from being the mother I should have been for you."
An addiction?
Why are you--
"No, no, don't interrupt me, please."
You just need to listen.
Listen carefully.
I know you're brave.
I know you don't cry.
But you need to come home.
Come back to our house.
He's not gonna let me.
- Yeah.
Shady Lady.
"Oh, my God."
Stop!
Whoa.
"Take a right, Nicolas!"
"Take a right, a right!"
Nicolas!
Nicolas!
"Hey, Nicolas!"
I need some help here.
Okay.
Somebody get a doctor!
"Hang on Nicolas, I'm going for help."
Nicolas!
"I swear to God, I don't know what happened."
He's epileptic.
I should have told you.
- I'll call an ambulance.
"- No, it will pass."
"It's okay, baby."
This hasn't happened for a while.
I didn't think to mention it.
I could kill myself for taking him on that ride.
"It's okay, it's not your fault."
He won't even remember it.
It'll be as if nothing ever happened.
Wanna come in?
I think you could use a drink.
I hope wine's okay with you.
That'll work.
What good is a home if you can't relax in it.
My daughter.
Where have you been?
"Maria, don't go!"
Don't leave me alone.
- Dad!
- Maria!
"- My baby, I missed you!"
- I'll tell Barbuda!
Where did your grandma take you?
Teach me how to walk on the tightrope.
I want to be part of your act.
- But you're so little!
"- Yeah, honey."
"Come on, please."
Teach me!
"We'll think about it, okay?"
Always remember that.
Aim at a spot ahead.
"Focus, and you won't fall."
"On the tips of your toes, then slide."
"Gently, just like that."
Yes.
Arms out and smile.
Smile to the crowd that's here to see you.
"Good, Maria."
"Did you see, Marcia?"
Our little acrobat!
Very good.
"Next, try it with the parasol."
Grab it either here or here.
Find the best grip.
Elegance.
"- Just myths, of course."
I doubt they're true.
That Hori...
Hiromitsu.
- Yes.
He died.
It's probably impossible to find out who has the other 11 tattoos.
Not at all.
But I'd like to know what this has to do with Lynn's death.
Nothing.
Just curious.
Actually I'm not supposed to give you this stuff.
Since you're on leave.
"Yeah, I know."
It's just for my report.
Oh well.
The case is closed.
"And anyway, you played a part in it, too."
Yeah?
"Yeah, did you check the list of names?"
Just a sec.
I got Lynn Wilson.
I need the other 11 people with a Hiromitsu.
Yes.
And all of them are reported dead or missing?
Thanks.
Thanks.
Schrader.
Schrader!
You aren't needed here.
Dix.
How observant.
Yes.
How old are you?
Twelve.
Is there someone inside you?
Sometimes.
Who is it?
I don't know.
Is it Captain Howdy?
I don't know.
"If I ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?"
No.
Why not?
I'm afraid.
"If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you."
Do you want him to leave you?
Yes.
I'm speaking to the person inside of Regan now.
"If you are there, you, too, are hypnotized and must answer all my questions."
Come forward and answer me now.
Are you the person inside of Regan?
Who are you?
-Help me!
- Let go!
Father Karras?
Have we met?
"No, we haven't met, but they said I could tell."
That you look like a boxer.
William F. Kinderman.
Homicide.
What's this all about?
It's true.
You do look like a boxer.
What was that?
Great!
Awesome!
What do we do?
No!
Jason!
Cynthia!
Cynthia!
Grab the oar!
Are you okay?
You all right?
Yeah.
We gotta go to shore!
"Cynthia, we're out of synch again."
"You know, you gotta paddle on the opposite side of the boat!"
"Well, Jason, I can't see which side you're paddling on!"
"Well, turn around and take a look every once in a while."
"Otherwise, we are gonna capsize again."
"You get that, right?"
It was an accident.
I'll bet it could have been avoided.
Right?
Am I right?
Baby' I need you to paddle.
"Cynthia, paddle the boat, please!"
You know what?
Sit down.
You've got to sit down in the boat!
Cynthia!
Cynthia!
Cynthia!
What are you doing?
I don't feel very well.
What the hell is that?
"Ok, I'm gonna call 911."
"Come on, pick up that goddamn phone."
I think I need something to eat.
"Please hang up, and try your call again."
"Please hang up now, this is a recording."
"Please hang up, and tr..."
Krista.
Oh no!
No!
Is he dead?
Yeah.
- What are you doing?
- Make it sure he stays that way.
Where will she go now?
I don't know.
- Think.
- I don't know!
They are all dead!
My entire family is... dead.
Not yet.
But the sun is coming up soon.
Let's go.
She's hanging out with a different crowd now.
Ever heard of Marcus Van Sciver?
"Van Sciver Incorporated, how can I direct your call, hello?"
Hello?
Krista.
All you have to do is die.
Welcome to the family.
Family?
I suppose?
Nazi bastard.
Over behind the church.
You know where I mean?
It's a red-brick wing.
St. Mike's.
What goes on there?
Who's the priest I keep seeing there?
He's there all the time.
"He has black hair, and he's intense-looking."
Damien Karras.
That's his office behind St. Mike's.
He's our psychiatric counselor.
"Had a pretty rough knock last night, poor guy."
His mother passed away.
"She was living by herself, and I guess she was dead a couple days before they found her."
Cunting hun!
Bloody damn butchering Nazi pig!
Stop it!
I'll kill you!
Aah!
Leave him alone!
Get out!
Get out!
[Shouting]
What's the matter with you?
What's for dessert?
You sleeping?
[Drunken singing]
Whoa!
"Steady, big fella."
Ok.
Get your Late Afternoon Star.
Afternoon Star:
Latest news in the latest paper.
That's the idea.
"Thank you, sir."
Late Afternoon Star right over here.
Get your Late Afternoon Star.
Here comes the colonel.
"He's in that cabin, colonel."
"You can't go down there, colonel."
The boy's gone crazy.
BROCK:
"Go on, back!"
No one's taking me and that goes for you too.
"Stay there or I'll drop you, I meant it."
Your last chance to turn around.
I'll count three.
One.
Two.
Three.
Send the doc.
Hurry it up.
"Hello, Dad."
Why am I calling you dad;
"-You used to call me that, Brock."
-Not since I got old enough to know better.
Growing up.
"That's great, isn't it;"
Don't talk.
Don't talk.
"You don't scare worth a nickel, Dad."
"-Docs always try, don't they;"
- What?
- No...
"No, not that."
Small...
Fly!
Fly!
Flying Tart!
"No, no, no, it got off to a flying start, and it's name... was Dragonfly!"
"Thank you, Polly."
"If I find out the money on that horse was yours, you know what I'll do, Basil."
You'll have to sew 'em back on first.
"- Ah, Major!"
"- 6:00, old boy."
"Oh, so it is."
"Uh, Major..."
"Can I offer you, uh..."
"Oh, very decent of you."
Just a quick one.
Going to a memorial service.
Ah.
"Tie's a bit bright, isn't it, Major?"
- What?
- For a memorial service?
"Oh, I didn't like the chap."
One of those.
Know what I mean?
- Cheers.
"- Uh, Major... could you do me a favor?"
"Well, I'm a bit short myself, old boy."
"No, no, could you look after some money for me?"
I won it on that horse.
"Only Sybil's a bit suspicious, you see?"
I'm Kim.
I'm a psychologist and a feminist.
- I'll be paying the bill.
- I'm Wayne.
Wayne!
Glen.
How are you now?
"- Ah, good and you?"
"- Oh, not so bad."
"Well, I guess the kitten's out of the clutch on this one."
I also have to work as a waitress to make ends meet.
- WAYNE:
Sure you do.
- I'm Kim.
Are you ever.
Look at you.
I'm lovin' this.
You're like a shark.
I'm scared.
"Like a Julie Moore, or like a Jessie Chastain."
- What can I get you to drink?
"- Uh, we'll need a minute."
"Uh, please and thank you."
Hmm.
All right.
"Well, you'll take care of little Miss Nicki Kidman here till I get back, Mr. McConaughey?"
"- Sure, I will."
- All right.
He crosses his arms.
Are you aware of the psychology behind that?
"Now, when you say ""he,"""
"you're talking about me, right?"
Oh.
Kissing ass is part of the job.
We're hot right now.
It's expected of us.
"I was expected to be at my own wedding, but guess what."
- Where was I?
In your kitchen.
- When was this now?
Don't make this about me.
You need to be in the kitchen.
"I'd be happy to work the room for you,Jack."
People don't like you as much as you think.
Move.
"Look, this came down from the Prince of Darkness."
It's happening.
But don't worry.
I put somebody in charge.
"In which case, I humbly and gratefully accept."
- Hey.
"- Guys, this is Becky."
We went to culinary school together.
She'll be covering for me.
Uh
- I
- But you're a- She's a-
Yes.
I pee sitting down.
Get over it.
- Wait.
Becky Sharp from Becky's on Fourth?
- Mm-hmm.
- I love that place.
"Come on, up on the stools, everybody."
I've an announcement to make.
Quick.
"Come on, move it, move it, will yous?"
Come on!
"Quick, get up there!"
Would you take it easy?
Get her down off that.
People have to eat at the...
Get her off the stool!
Shut up!
Shut up!
"Happy birthday, Darren."
"Happy birthday, Darren."
"Yeah, good lad."
"There you go, what."
- What is it?
- Open it and see.
It's not a bike.
"He's brilliant, isn't he?"
I know that!
"- Ooh, wow."
- Very nice.
It's a pump.
"It's a very good one, too."
"See, I'm gonna get you a wheel for your Christmas... and another wheel for your next birthday... and then the saddle, what."
Ha ha ha ha.
You can pump yourself to school every morning now.
"Go away, you."
Yous are messing.
"We are, of course."
"Kay, when you're ready."
Do... no.
"My... my father never looked like that, so he can't be."
He isn't.
"He isn't, he isn't."
- But he is.
- Mnh-mnh.
He's the best version of your father.
"Physically, his cells were recoded for optimal capacity."
"Physically, he is the best version."
"Inside, however, I'm still just me."
You saw it.
"I think Gracie saw it, too."
Don't you say her name.
Arthur:
Agent Pritchard's facial effect indicates he is at 54% acceptance.
What the hell is that thing?
"Agent Pritchard, let me take you through this slowly, from the start."
You're not taking me through anything.
Mnh-mnh.
Mnh-mnh.
"You two, this... this apartment, this... that tank out there."
That... that thing in the mirror.
- I'm not...
- Duval!
Son.
It's me.
I'm back.
No.
I buried you.

"I told you, hmm?"
-It should be faster.
"-No, I get what she's doing."
It's sultry.
She's going for romantic.
"Is that what you're going for, Jane?"
A love song?
Come on!
Let him go.
"No, let him go!"
Let me at him!
Those are mine.
-What are?
-Your tits.
You're such a brute.
Hello.
Hi.

-Absolutely not.
"It's an unexpected pleasure, really."
We were just discussing romance.
Come on in.
"Sit down, come on."
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Yeah.
Have a good night.
I'm really starting to love this.
"It's dated, you know?"
It's not dated.
We just wrote it.
It doesn't even have a date on it yet.
-Why are you so contrary?
-You wouldn't respect me otherwise.

Take it.
Take it.
"It's Christmas, Joey."
"""Merry Christmas to Joey, from the gang."""
Open it.
I'll open for you.
"Come on, Joey, play."
Air raid!
Air raid!
Everybody out of the barracks!
Not on Christmas Eve.
You must get out.
"For your own good, you must get out."
And put out those candles.
Come on.
Let's hit the slit trenches.
I'll bet it's a phony again.
The Pentagon will hear about this.
- I'm not really built for war.
- Get out here.
Did you hear about Mr. Rossi.
"-No, what?"
-He's leaving town.
-Leaving?
"-Well, not really leaving."
They're trying to make him principal of a high school in Portland.
-Are you sure?
-Of course.
I got it first hand.
From Mr. Rossi?
"From Kathy, who got it from Betty, who got it from Miss Thornton."
I suppose that's first hand.
I guess we won't be able to keep him here.
-This is nice.
Can I try it on?
"-Sure, come on."
-Merry Christmas.
-Come in.
Merry Christmas.
It's been a long time and it is Christmas.
You don't have to explain a gift.
Thank you.
Come in.
-Let me take your coat.
-I can only stay a moment.
I have to deliver a few more things.
-Can I fix you a drink?
"-No, thank you."
"Well, come in, sit down."
"Well, I really came to... ls it really true that you might go to Portland?"
I received the offer.
"It's a larger school and, naturally, more money."
Hey.
I'm looking to score.
"You know, party favors."
"Come on, Coreen."
Do you want angel tears or crow?
Angel tears?
"Come on, come on..."
"angel tears is acid, crow is cocaine."
Come on.
I'm actually looking for something a little different.
"Evan told me about it, but I can't remember the name."
Venom?
That's it.
Venom.
Do you know where I can find any?
Something I said?
I've got a lead.
Over.
Oh!
Wynter.
"Hey, I hear you're looking for some venom."
"Yeah, do you know where I can get some?"
Um-hum...
How about straight from the source.
First time's free.
- You don't have to do this.
- You're wrong.
- I do.
- Ugh...oh...!
Let's be on our way.
- Why?
"- Well, didn't you know?"
"Jeez, not again."
Eva?
I'll have a look.
"Come on, shug?"
Hi.
Hello.
Hot.
Yeah.
"Um, dad's inside."
Mum too.
Ok.
But I'm glad to catch you.
Better get these iceblocks inside.
This won't take long.
Had us all quite worried that day you disappeared.
I told mum I was sorry.
Where'd you go?
Streets around Uncle Malcolm's.
I spoke to a bus driver.
Apparently a girl who looked a lot like you caught a bus out here that afternoon.
So?
So it wasn't you?
No.
I really gotta go.
Your father was quite desperate to find you.
He thought ms murnane may have harmed you.
She killed thom.
"He broke in, which was wrong, searching her house for you."
We found the jacket there.
I saw the news.
"Before he went over, I was talking to him on the phone."
So?
This is a gift offriendship.
Good luck!
"Jenny, take cover!"
Don't move!
Jenny!
Jenny!
Dumbo!
- Give me a gun!
- Here!
How good a shot are you?
I'm a cop.
I have to be good!
"We've been through so much, and I don't even know your name."
Is it important?
"Whether we win or lose, you won't be around."
I'd like to have a name to rememberyou by.
Would you rather see me dead or set free?
"Neither, iffate spares us."
You're a hell ofa good friend.
Just remember me as Mickey Mouse.
Why not?
Leave her alone!
She's innocent!
Drop your gun!
"You heard me, hurry up!"
Jeffrey!
"Where are you,Jeffrey?"
"Don't be afraid,Jenny."
I'm in front ofyou.
Drop your gun!
"Jenny, don't move an inch!"
Don't hurt her.
I can look like a man.
What do you think?
- How is Maria Concetta?
- She escaped.
"Then you didn't get anything, is that it?"
"Yes, and you're going blind."
You're even wearing glasses|.
"Well, the doctor says..."
It's just that my eyes are exhausted.
Are you worried about syphilis?
"So we don't want to hear about that, is that right?"
I'm not the one who has to worry about that.
Very good!
Very good!
So why are you scratching?
True.
Quiet!
I was waiting for you.
Everything alright?
"Yes, it's fine."
It's hot.
It's hot.
"- Go on, push."
- It hurts.
It's too hot.
"Ice, I want ice."
Give me a bit of ice.
- Not coffee.
He wants ice.
"- Ice, I want ice."
Impossible.
Impossible.
It's heavy.
- More?
- Much more.
This man hasn't had a bath since the last time he fell off the boat.
Change of plans.
Going straight from Uncle Frank's Mayday to wounded Johnnie fixing the propeller.
"Hurry up, Rex."
We need you over here.
"Yes, sir."
Corning.
Quick as I can.
"Right, what can I do for you, sir?"
"Right, be careful."
Careful.
"And watch out for that-- Watch the wires, please."
- I thought you'd be at the office.
- Don't lean against it.
I was.
I read your ending.
You bagged it.
- You were almost there.
- Nowhere near.
I've been useless for weeks.
"I read your other stuff, too."
Oh?
- What did you think?
- Hmm.
Bit inconclusive.
I wasn't really sure where it was going next.
No.
"I wasn't too sure of that, either."
Crumbs.
"Okay, I'm going to wash it."
So put the pillow on now.
Now person number one is going to go.
Might be me.
Might be Rebecca.
"- Okay, you go."
- I don't want your cooties.
Wipe it off.
Okay.
Person number two- citizen two is beginning now.
Get away.
- Can I have the washcloth?
- The wet one or the dry one?
The dry one.
"So, what was the difference?"
"Yeah, who was better- number one or number two?"
You were exactly the same.
I couldn't tell the difference.
"As far as everything goes with you,Jim-"
Are you guys all packed foryour mom's?
Yeah.
- What's that?
- Dave planted it.
What a romantic guy.
I'm in here.
Come in.
Okay.
"Well, I'm off."
I'm just brushing my teeth.
"God, I used to hate that nightgown."
"Other people have to look at it, but they can't read it."
That's the point.
- I am so glad that you guys are here.
"- Well, thank you for inviting us."
We miss you.
"Yeah, well, Eddie's been out on the road, you know."
- Eddie's been on the road?
- Yeah.
"So the midget says, ""Hey, that's why I became a taxidermist."" Ha-ha-ha."
- Hey.
- You can't say that anymore.
"Whatever. ""Munchkin."" It's a good joke."
It's a good joke.
It's a good joke.
- What?
What?
- I keep missing things.
- I'm actually working on that...
"- Whoa, whoa, whoa."
- Hey.
- I got it.
Under control.
Under control.
Where is he going?
"Hey, you guys know the one about the Wisconsin farmer"
- and the burnt barn?
- I'm sure you're gonna tell us.
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
We've been through this before.
It's gonna be fine.
- Is everybody gone?
"- Yeah, they're gone."
- I'm really sorry.
Good God.
Er...
Lucy's the little one?
Yes.
- And her husband did that to her?
- It happens.
Does this have something to do with the other day?
Yes.
- But you don't want to talk to me about it?
- I can't.
All right.
I...
I understand.
- You do?
- She's your friend.
"Whatever you were trying to do for her, get her away from him, to..."
"Barking, whatever..."
Even if it didn't work that...was a good thing for a friend to do.
- Timothy...
"- No, no, I understand."
I didn't before.
But...
I do now.
Thank you.
- I was hoping to see her at the end of the day.
"- Yes, well, you must."
- You will be back in time for this...
"- Yes, of course."
- He was in the rubble for three days?
"- With her body, yes."
Jesus!
- Who was the psychiatrist they sent him to?
"Hiya, Red."
Here?
Bring him in.
Bring him down.
"I think you'll unbutton your lip now, Joe."
Maybe you'll talk to your son.
My what?
Here.
"Hiya, sonny boy!"
"Had a long trip today, huh?"
"Oh, sort of confused."
"Well, your old man's confused, too."
My father?
Is my father here?
Where?
"Right here, the great Joe Krozac."
"He's been pining for you, sonny boy."
Father?
That's not my father.
Sure it is.
Ain't he pretty?
Are you all crazy?
"Y- you're kidding, ain't you?"
How do I know this is my-my-
This ought to make it sink home.
See?
That's my father.
That's dads and mother.
"You're just kidnappers, aren't you?"
I see what you're heading for.
"No use trying anything with this kid, see?"
Because that ain't a picture of that dame.
I'm okay.
Come here.
You're okay now?
You're okay now?
Drink up.
Good girl.
Leave it.
I want to tidy up a little.
Leave it.
We've got the shaman to thank for everything.
Get some rest.
You must be exhausted.
Shaman
Damn fool.
Suspect arrested in the mushroom-tonic case...
Victims have developed severe mental derangement...
Mr. Yang E-sam?
Yes.
The landlady was a victim.
"Your uncle must've taken the tonic, too."
It's turned the town upside down.
We've gotta bring him in.
You should get a lawyer.
"After all, he's a victim, too."
What the fuck?
What are you doing here?
Get out.
Missed calls
- Shaman
What the hell?
What the...?
Hello.
All right.
He'll probably call me.
"No, no waiting."
We are in this situation because of your bullshit...
So sort yourself out and take care of the matter tonight.
Was that Vlad?
"I am going to smash your face in, you fucker!"
Why did you say Elena ran away?
Are you mad?
"It wasn't me, I said nothing."
Must be the Shark!
"He's a good guy, he wouldn't have squealed!"
"I swear it's not me, Niko!"
Word of honour.
Tell the girls to get ready.
"Tonight, I want them to work flat-out."
I see them.
Do you see them?
- Yes.
Great.
There are five...
"No, six."
Take their pictures.
Hurry up!
"- Yes, I'm hurrying."
- Is it OK?
Wait...
On the bridge on the right there.
I can't believe it.
It's Ronaldo.
Do you see him?
- Wait.
This isn't good.
This is fabulous.
I love it.
"Oh, Cookie shake."
"Oh, he loves it too."
And Cookie's never wrong.
It's a hit.
You guys are amazing.
"Amazing, yes."
"I was just saying, the minute I wrote it,"
I knew it was the song for you.
"Well done, Megan."
"Come on, Cookie, let's find someone who can take you for a walk."
Love the layers...
"Tanya, can you believe it?"
Livi loves the song I wrote for her.
We're now officially
"""amazing..."""
Where have you been'?
An ice-cold milkshake for you.
Forget the drinks.
I've got just the task for you.
"If you do it well, you can record your own song, become rich and famous and make a gazillion new friends."
How does that sound?
I'm all ears.
Uh...
- Oh.
"- That was, um, original."
Thanks.
It's called Funky Sitar Groove To The Max.
"Oh, Yeah."
Uh...
Watch yourself.
Watch yourself.
There's glass.
What happened?
"I told her I wasn't thirsty, and she kept sticking that goddamn straw in my face."
[Sighs] Fuck.
"If you keep running off all these nurses, there's gonna be no one left, dad."
It's a simple job.
You water me and feed me.
I'm a fucking plant.
But that goddamn woman...
She's trying to do the Tijuana waterboard on me!
"Okay, dad, you can't say that shit."
Come on.
[Chuckles]
"But, hey."
I lied.
I am thirsty.
[Pill bottles clacking]
I want you to get me a drink.
A real one.
You sure you're...
Allowed to do that?
Does it really matter?
"- Yeah, that's a good point."
- Thank you.
"Now, let's be a couple of outlaws and get me a fucking drink."
[Chuckling] Okay.
Okay.
[Exhales sharply]
"Yeah, why not?"
[Music playing]
The sign says 'Booneville. '
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry to bother you.
Which way is 44th?
- That way.
- Great.
Thanks.
- I got asked directions.
- I saw.
He took me for a native.
That's so cool.
That's very impressive.
44th is the other way.
- No.
- It's all right.
"Man, I should go find him."
He'll figure it out when he sees the numbers getting smaller.
He still thought I was a native.
That's cool.
I'm your witness.
"- Well, I should go."
- Okay.
I got to go to my mom's graduation.
- And give her Belinda.
- And give her Belinda.
Go on.
I'll check on the guy.
I'll make sure he's not wandering around looking for 44th.
Why did you come here?
- What?
"- I said, why did you come here?"
You ditched school and everything.
"Come on, I'm messing with you."
"It's nothing, really."
I'm ok.
This isn't your fault.
"Actually, it is."
You're a team leader.
You made a tactical decision.
And you got hurt.
Again.
You did what you thought was right.
And that's all you can do.
"The rest of it, that's not up to us."
That's the job.
"This is nothing, really."
"I mean, the thing with Doyle, that..."
I'm kidding!
I'm...
"== sync, corrected by elderman =="
MARIA'S TIGHTROPE
Maria.
"Come on, sweetie."
"Maria, my child."
Come on and bring your bag.
"Let's get going or we'll be late, sweetie."
- See you later.
- Bye.
"Maria, say bye."
"Gosh, I hope we didn't miss the bus."
My stomach is killing me.
"Foguinho, you can't handle fire eating anymore."
But I'm not sure about my magic yet.
Who said anything about dough?
"Well, uh, at least sit down and have a drink."
Why not make it two?
One for you.
"- Well, I'll have a little one."
- Good.
Heh.
How much?
"Oh, about two ounces."
One for each kidney.
[LAUGHING]
Here.
"Oh, uh, chaser?"
- Always have been.
- Oh...
[BOTH LAUGHING]
I walked in.
What are you doing?
This guy's a murderer.
A murderer!
Do you understand that?
"Well, I think about my wife tracy every day,"
And then I see his face.
I wanted something to put him away.
All right.
"I'll tell you what, if you're right,"
I'll help you.
But you better be right.
"Woman Oh, my god."
What are you doing to her?
You shouldn't be here.
You're sick!
"Relax, okay?"
Scanning.
- Video link confirmed.
- Up.
This next part might hurt.
Maybe quite a lot.
"But it won't last long, I promise."
Almost there.
Welder.
You can do it.
"Wonderful, Henry."
Squeeze.
Harder.
"Cool, right?"
Integument?
Please don't move your hand.
You probably don't recall.
You were never a big fan of my work.
Maybe this will change your mind.
Right?
Memory's a funny thing.
I'm an expert and I don't know if you'll ever get yours back.
"You don't remember me at all, do you, Henry?"
My name is Estelle.
You and I were... we still are... husband and wife.
"I love you, Henry."
I can't wait to hear you say it.
Henry.
His memories are still catching up with him.
"Oh, Jesus."
- I'm Robbie.
- The sorcerer of sound.
"Oh, of course."
Ambassador.
Right.
"Um, well, Paris, right?"
J'adore Paris.
"I've never been, but it looks amazing."
- No.
"- No, that's not gonna happen."
"- Oh, of course."
- Do you have another...
"Well, I love Australia."
Down under.
And the president needs you to vote no on tonight's bill.
Are you guys... are you...
Are you serious?
"Okay, the president, she wants me to vote against her bill?"
- Am I being stupid here?
- Yes.
Yes.
No.
"I mean, you're..."
"No, you're not being..."
"It's, yes, you need to vote no."
"Okay, I can..."
love it.
"Don't get it, but it's all right."
I just want to help.
"But, yeah, just let me know where I'm going."
- You need to know now?
"- Yeah, that would be great."
"What'd you say, ma'am?"
Mm-hmm.
"Oh, guys, check this shit out."
I woke up holding a winning ticket.
"Daddy's revenge, 20 grand!"
Oh!
- God damn it!
- Oh.
I knew you'd outlive me.
"I'm invincible, sweetheart."
"All right, let's see who won the pool."
When did you wake up?
"Uh, let's call it 11:20."
That's my square!
250 bucks!
"I love you, Frank."
"I love you too, dollface."
Five minutes off.
You bet on my dad's death?
You didn't?
"Ah, baby, you won the over/unders."
100 bucks.
Everybody's a winner.
"Stink hand, watch the door."
Daddy needs a cigar.
"- Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
"- Oh, for God's sakes, Frank."
"No, no, Dad, Dad, Dad, come on."
I think...
Why don't you just order Italian beef while you're at it?
"- Jesus, Frank."
"- That's a good idea, honey."
W...
"Jesus Christ, I can't get that goddamn song out of my head."
Mr. Truesdale.
"Evenin', Lyle."
I knew the German girl worked at the lodge.
That's why I called Greg.
"I didn't want to bother you, sir."
You-
"- You told him that, didn't you, Greg?"
Yeah.
"Uh, Dad wanted to come."
I insisted.
Hilla was one of my best employees.
Melvin.
Mr. Truesdale.
"Uh, she's back here."
Oh.
You were close?
Uh--
Yeah.
We were friends.
"I-- Ah, he's a good-looking kid."
Lots of girls at the lodge have their eye on him.
"Suck it up, Greg."
[ Chuckles ] Kid's got his mother's stomach.
Seems like there was more to it than that.
Her name's Hilla.
Hilla Danner.
I hired her as a desk clerk at the beginning of the season.
"She, uh, have any family?"
I believe they were all killed during the war.
"Well, looks like you're gonna have to bury her in potter's field."
I'll pay for it.
"Well, that's real nice of you, sir."
No!
- Teddy...
"- Oh, damn."
Damn.
Oh.
- What?
"- What happened, Ted?"
- I did what you asked for.
- I'm tired.
- I've been fighting you for so long.
- You don't have to fight any more.
"He's a liar, Ted."
I said it all ends today.
These agents.
It all ends today.
- What does that mean?
- It means he's decided on an endgame.
He's going to kill himself and the hostages.
"Ted, no one on this train is an agent but me."
No one else.
I'm the only one.
You can let everybody else go.
"I don't think so, Ted."
Do you?
"Dr. Bryar, we need to get this woman help."
"I don't think so, Ted."
Do you?
"Dr. Bryar, we need to get this woman help."
Who's going to help me?
The Higher Authorities can help you.
They're not what you think.
They're not the enemy.
"Maybe I can help, you know."
You just need to communicate.
See this book?
It talks about all the different stages of forgiveness.
"- You know, they say that""s very important."
"- Thank you, sweetie."
"Daddy""s home."
How do I look?
You look great.
Thank you.
Do you like it?
Yeah.
I got some strawberries.
Do you want me to say things?
Dirty things?
Is that what you want?
How does she touch you?
Does she touch you like this?
"Does she let you, you know..."
- Would you like me to try that?
"- Don""t talk, Clara."
"I will try it for you, David."
It might excite me.
"You excite me, David."
See how we fit?
"I can hold you all night, David."
"- I hate it, Clara."
- I love it.
"- Oh, my gosh, y""all!"
"Lt""s beautiful."
- Wait.
"Hold that up higher, honey."
"Nice kicks, by the way."
Where did you get them?
Some place on Melrose.
I'm waiting for these limited-edition Japanese imports.
They've got blue and orange on the side and this red mesh on the soles.
- I had my publicist put me on the list.
- They sound great.
"I could ask her to put you on it too, if you want."
If you don't mind matching.
- No.
Sure.
- Right on.
"I'll need your info, though."
I'm so sorry.
"You're Dr. Phillip, right?"
From Tempest Bay?
- That's me.
"- I know it's completely hicksville,"
- but would you sign my gym bag?
- Sure.
No problem.
Thanks.
"Oh, my God."
My mom's gonna flip out.
Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
"- Too bad it's always moms, right?"
- Yeah.
Bummer.
- He was hitting on me.
- You are so full of yourself.
"Lindsay, no kid talk."
We get enough of that when the nannies take a break.
- Let's talk about the book.
"- Well, I loved it."
You know what else I love?
Hummus.
Couldn't stop thinking about it when they described the Middle Eastern-y part.
Oh.
Hummus.
Fun idea.
Belinda.
"Christine, where's Belinda?"
"Uh, I guess she stepped away."
Ugh.
I am gonna have to let that girl go.
"Oh, but I'm sure she's coming right back."
- Is there anything I can do to help?
- We need hummus.
- And sangria.
"- Ooh, that sounds good."
"Oh, that does sound good."
And roasted red peppers.
"Oh, me make it."
Right.
"Belinda, are you in there?"
I need you.
"Christine, for God's sake, I asked for that sangria a week ago."
- Where's Belinda?
"- Oh, she's not feeling well."
She's lying down.
Probably.
By now.

"Man, them sorry ass cats can't play no ball."
You catch the game last night?
"Nah, just the lowlights."
"Yeah, you didn't miss much."
(Toilet flushing)
I don't want that shit.
Slap that bitch right there.
Everything going all right?
Everything is everything.
You got pay stubs for me?
Yeah.
"Hey, what's up?"
Any police contact?
Hey.
Any police contact?
"Nah, nah."
All right.
Everything's looking on the up and up.
Stay away from the bullshit.
You're doing all right.
I'll see you next week.
All right.
(Women giggling)
(Angela) Enrique?
"Yeah, in the bathroom, ma."
What are you doing?
What do you mean?
Isn't tonight Michael's school thing?
"Yeah, but I didn't think you were going."
Now you got a hot date.
It's not that big a deal.
Ah.
I think our table is ready.
"We should just sit right down, I think."
"Yes, thank you."
To the buzzer.
A Sports Illustrated moment.
I actually think I got hit by Kobe's sweat when he took the shot.
Nice.
You still down for hanging out?
Sure.
"Uh, do you..."
you know a bar around here?
Let's skip the bar.
Too many drunken fans.
Fine by me.
What did you want to do?
Let's get out of here.
Take a drive up Mulholland.
- Mulholland?
- My girlfriend's out of town.
- I don't have a curfew.
Hop in.
"Lt'll be fun, I promise."
That is a beautiful watch.
I have three sons and a brother.
Always looking for good gift ideas.
- Where did you buy it?
- Fred Segal's.
- Oh.
- Did their Christmas display last year.
An homage to 1940s noir.
Hm.
Come quickly.
Would you like soup kitchen?
It's not him.
It's alright though.
"He don't like strangers, see."
Don't like a lotta things.
But you took his boat without asking.
Weren't you scared?
One of the soldier's had this kit bag and suddenly it woofed!
It gave us such a fright.
It was a dog.
And one of them Frenches tried to kiss her.
I'm scared now of what your dad might do.
No!
He got himself a bottle.
He thought we'll be back before he woke up.
"Besides, Eric was in Dunkirk."
Eric?
Dad's first-mate.
Got us photographs for our birthday.
Yeah.
He got same birthday.
"Robert Donat in ""The 39 Steps""... and John Clements in ""The Four Feathers""."
Have you ever met John Clements?
No.
I haven't.
Those ones are mum's.
We don't know who he is.
Oh!
I did meet him.
Is there going to be a film?
Probably not.
- Hi.
"- No, thanks."
Why not?
"If I let you, it'll cost me more."
"All right, all right, fair enough."
"How about if I can get you to say the word ""seventeen""?"
"I bet I can get you to say ""seventeen,"" and if I do, you have to join us."
- You're on.
- All right.
- What's two plus two?
- Four.
- Four plus four?
- Eight.
- Eight plus eight?
- Sixteen.
"See, I told you I could get you to say ""sixteen."""
"- No, you said ""sevente""..."
- See?
What?
You walked right into that one.
"Okay, I'm impressed."
"All right, you can buy me a drink now."
- All right.
- What's going on here?
Mr. Heller.
"Gary, you... know this one?"
Ms. Keyes works for me.
Really?
Give your HR person a bonus.
"All right, all right."
What are you doing here?
I live right around the corner.
"Uh, with a ""v"" and a lot of dollar marks."
And this one from mayor hoffman and the board of aldermen.
Jim!
I just saw old drew in the lobby.
How do you know it was him?
"Well, he looks like a runt pickle and he's got an old umbrella stick with a goose-head handle."
That's him!
I knew it!
Bellboy?
"Yes, sir."
Go and tell mr.
Fisk that mr.
Daniel drew is waiting to see him.
"Yes, sir."
Tell me-do you go to sunday school?
"Yes, sir."
"Mulberry street church, sir."
Mulberry street.
Well... i pass the plate there myself.

And remember-i'll be looking for them next sunday.

Fisk.
"Who is it, son?"
It's mr.
"Daniel drew, sir."
Oh.
Here.
Tell him i'm busy.
"Yes, sir."
"Dale, go!"
Well ...
Lord.
"No, it's not real."
It seems to me.
Rory had to pee with laughter.
How do you know?
It looks real.
"Come on, it's a reality."
There are millions of people watching us right now.
Addons Now that the penalty completed.
Back to the game.
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!
Max!
You'd be annoyed.
"Addons Are you having fun, Max?"
Locked.
Addons Max has violated the rules try to contact with people outside the game.
How can break the rules?
Addons I was in the terms and conditions.
Damn.
Addons I have to take a penalty again.
"No, please."
No more.
"Addons Max, you have to lose a friend."
Lord.
Addons Let us choose to Max.
Addons may not realize it.
Say you're sorry.
Addons Let's see.
They are your friends!

# Too frightened to know
# She was leaving forever
# The land of her soul #
"Now, that's all you're getting."
It's more than you deserve.
Beautiful.
- I can die a happy man now I've heard that.
- You'll outlive us all.
Only the good die young.
"- Quiet, isn't it?"
- It's the country.
- It's always quiet.
"- Yeah, but... it's a bit creepy, really."
Yeah.
Where were you planning on staying tonight?
Or weren't you?
Ah...
You know...
I'll find somewhere.
I'll sleep in the car.
You know me.
I can sleep on a rope.
"You're a feckin' torment, Tommy."
"Well, look at that sky."
Look!
- There's a shooting star.
- That's a satell...
"A satellite, yeah."
I know.
I was just checking.
# I saw two shooting stars last night.
Hooray!
That dog done it.
- He all right?
- Hope so.
"Oh, I beg your pardon, old boy, but haven't you forgotten about the money?"
The gelt?
Please.
Mmm!
"Thank you, sir."
"- Oh, say."
You know something?
- Well?
You'd make a good dog biscuit.
"- What's that, a halter?"
- Yeah.
Hmm.
"Being as I'm working like a horse, I just as well look like one."
There you are.
Now hang on to this.
Is that all?
Did you remember nails?
Nails.
Hammers and saw.
Look.
You bought 'em yourself.
What's the matter with you this morning?
- Nothing.
Get out.
- Mmm.
"Oh, hey, listen-"
There's something we did forget - a medicine kit.
"We need some iodine and quinine, just in case."
- Where are we going?
- To a nicer room.
My lunch box....
There we go.
Don't you be scared.
I'll stay with you until we take you upstairs.
- I made it in school.
- It's beautiful.
- It's for you.
- Thank you.
- Nice.
- Yeah.
- The plastic surgeon will be here soon.
- We won't be needing your surgeon.
- Excuse me?
- My plastic surgeon's coming.
- Who?
- Fred.
- Fred Mendoza?
He'll cost a fortune.
- It's only your daughter's face.
"- No, I hate him."
That's why you called.
- He's the best in Chicago.
For lopsided breasts.
Touchy subject.
- Is he all right?
- Mouth-to-mouth's not working.
- His airway's blocked.
- Paramedics are coming any minute.
- That Medevac copter will take us.
- That's a TV news chopper.

We've lost the package.
Secure the exits.
- Which Way's this go?
- West Wing.
"Run, Mr. President!"
Move!
Move!
This leads to the basement.
"- We 're in the stairwell, coming your way."
- Shit.
We gotta go!
"Elevator's here, let's go!"
Shit!
God!
They're in the elevator heading up!
- Cut them off in the Central Hall!
- What are you doing?
Get him!
Take care of Bobby.
"- Killick, stop them at the elevator."
- I'm on it.
He's in the residence!
Cut him off at the residence!
Son of a bitch!
"You screwed us, Walker."
You've got one of your guys running around.
- Not one of my guys.
- Then who is he?
"I don't know, probably some schmuck from one of the tours."
Your tourist killed one of my best men!
"Yummy, and you could be having that all day!"
"_Me,?"
A' es'!
- Is that him?
- Yeah!
"A looker, isn't he?"
"Jean, what's happening?"
Jean!
My hair flew away!
His hair comes off!
You look good in anything.
Just look at him!
He's real handsome.
My hair!
- We'll set things right.
- Right!
I bet those monsters at the mill are in on this.
"Get away, you monsters!"
I'm off to investigate.
Such a draft again!
You do it on purpose!
My poor head!
The pain'll kill me.
"At least it'll be over, without Elisa I have nothing."
I'm a lonely and deserted orphan...
"- No, you have me!"
- Exactly.
"Don't worry, your Grace."
I'm here to help you.
"Who are you, an apparition?"
The ghost of aunt Bertha Gloria.
"Ghost, my foot."
Here.
It's a sore.
How long has she been treating you?
Half a year.
Wow that's a long time.
Doctor Imm's patients never get better.
Stop bitching you chink.
"Chinky, stop chatting in Line."
Focus on me a little?
Here for you.
Doctor Imm.
"Tell him if he has to stay awake, do not stay awake for more than 1 day."
Take the bedtime pills.
And get some rest.
I feel the chemistry inside my body is changing.
But I don't know what it is.
Oh!
"Tell him, do not scratch."
Doc....
I....
"Hey, you're just supposed to read it."
Can I please just reply her?
Doc.
I am sorry about last month.
Read.
Can I just read her reply?
Happy New Year.
Get some rest.
Turn off your computer and go to the beach.
See the sunrise or something.
Same to you...
That's enough.
"Yeah, how do we know we're not asking a ballerina, or a lawyer, or a math teacher to take off her clothes?"
We just got to go for it.
"Frank, I think I need to see the money."
"Excuse me, miss, do you have a minute?"
"Uh, ma'am?"
Get out of my way.
Excuse me.
Yes?
Are you a prostitute?
What?
Will you take your clothes off for $103.62?
"Thanks, Kevin."
What?
What'd I do?
-You all right?
-No.
"Psst, psst, psst."
Guys...
You guys need some help?
Are you talking to us?
Yeah.
We want to see a naked lady.
"Ooh, how much money you got?"
$103.62.
Really?
That'll do it.
Come on.
Right through here.
"Come on, come on, come on."
Where?
There are naked women in here?
"Guys, you got to trust me."
- Me?
- What is that... ketchup?
What?
"- Okay, not bad."
- You felt it?
"A bit, a bit."
"- Okay, my turn."
- All right.
Taxi!
- I'm so sorry.
- No worries.
"Ooh, man, only a slight breeze that time."
- Yeah?
"- Yeah, it's getting better."
All right.
Ready for some driving?
"- Yeah, let's do it."
- Let's go.
"I could use a little ""Viva La Vida"" right about now."
"Okay, how about this?"
"From now on, whoever has the wallet controls the radio."
"Deal, baby."
Let the game begin.
What the...
How'd you do that?
- Thank you.
- Son of a bitch.

"- It's sourdough, right?"
He got married when he was 21.
There's no evidence he ever cheated on his wife.
Too bad we're not running in France.
We could really nail him on that one.
When do you have your lunch with him?
With Shelly Runyon?
I'm not having lunch with him.
"Friday, 1:00."
It's scheduled tomorrow.
It's automatic.
He's committee chairman.
It was set up.
S.O.P.
- Laine.
- Shelly.
I'm sorry I started.
You were late.
"- I'm not too late, I hope."
- A minute or two.
- Were you tied up with anything?
"- No, sorry."
I'm just late.

So why did you come back?
You said you'd take me to CompUSA so I could get a new Magic Stick.
And I will.
I got stuff to do.
I told you.
I'd better get going.

I'm going to watch the Bloomberg.

You know how to do that?
I'm going to pay somebody... $35 an hour?

You got married yet?
Maybe when he gets back from Port St. Lucie.
He's bound to accept one or the other.
Mumsie.
"Oh, Mumsie!"
This is stark-staring murder!
"Remember, before you pop him in, you must take his keys."
But why should I have to do all the dirty work?
He'd never take a drink from me.
He'd suspect foul play!
- I shall be hung!
"- It's ""hanged"", and you won't be."
"Oh, Mumsie!"
I'll go by the service stairs to avoid him.
Is everything clear?
Good.
I'll be in the car at the front.
"The moment he falls insensible, signal from the window."
- You'll have a lot to answer for.

100... 150... 100 or 150?
100.
Special rate?
Yes.
"After one hundred, the rest doesn't matter."
Do you know that or not?
I don't know.
"We grow old, you know."
"I have to go, I have exams."
I'll be back.
Come back quickly.
Don't forget.
"Hello, Tajdolat."
"Hello, are you well?"
Are you looking for something?
My camera.
We left it here and it's gone.
You didn't lock the car.
"One night has passed, you expect it to be there?"
"Hello, good luck."
Eat.
O-Waka-chan!
Matsuki-chan!
O-ume you are not quite good.
Right?
I'll go see.
Sada-don!
Sadakichi-don!
Yes.
Where's the fire?
There's anyone on the rooftop?
I'm on my way.
It's in the Honjo district.
You know?
Also the wind comes from the northwest.
Don't worry.
Matsuki-san?
The son of the neighbor!
Isn't he?
!
The love of Matsuki-san for fire will give him trouble.
Right?
Matsuki!
Where did he go?
Told you to keep an eye on him if the fire bell was heard.
Where did the keeper go?
Send people to the fire chief place.
Tell him I said not to let him in to the place of fire.
It took a lot of dealing.
You heard it?
"Dear, will you talk about that again?"
It's because Naritaya-san has a reputation of being meticulous.
Alex Dolgin is so busy?
I'm Jonathan from the junior company.
I'll be reading Reno Laroire.
Would you like something to drink?
"No, thank you."
This is my brother-in-law.
Hello.
- Hello.
"And this is Goni, his daughter."
Hi.
Jonathan.
"- Yeah, I heard."
So the actors are coming at 12:00?
"Yes, so we should hurry."
At one there's a small reception for the new season.
Only one hour for the reading?
"That's what we were told, Mr. Ben-Shmuel."
Call him Yitzhak.
"It's just the first act, Daddy."
It's ridiculous.
- I'll talk to Alex.
"No, I'll talk to him."
Things must be done properly.
"Yitzhak, please don't be stressed."
"""Don't be stressed."""
Where is the rehearsal?
In the makeup room?
"Yes, at the end of the hall."
I'm going home.
I told you this would happen.
I'm going to talk to Alex.
Sit with Dad and calm him down.
I thought I heard you...
I th... forget it.
Did you wanna talk about something?
We can talk later.
Let's talk now.
"Lydia, come on!"
Ly... wait!
Why are you asking Lydia about Jackson's real parents?
Why are you bringing out the claws on camera?
That's right.
You wanna play catwoman?
I'll be your Batman.
"If you're wondering about Jackson's real parents, they're about half a mile from here."
In beacon hills cemetery.
I...
I have to get to cl...
"oh, no, no, you don't."
"No, you have perfect grades."
You can skip one class.
Are you okay?
Your heart's beating like crazy.
Allison.
Do you know how they died?
Maybe.
If you tell me why you're so interested.
Um...
"It's him, isn't it?"
What?
Who?
Him who?
"The test didn't work, but it's still him."
It's Jackson.
"Uh, um..."
OK.
I've done the catheterization.
"Yeah, no, I wasn't talking to you."
"Hey, Sam."
You two know each other.
"Yeah, that's right."
"Biblically, even."
We dated.
We did not date.
We were in love.
Or at least I was.
I'm really sorry about Stephanie.
Sam...
"Hey, sweetie."
- I don't want to.
I can't.
- I know.
- Not without Stephanie...
- I know.
I don't want to go on.
"I know, listen:"
"I gotta tell ya,"
"I have never been afraid of anything my entire life, except for your father."
"So I have got to go in and look for blockages and try to fix them so he doesn't kill me, OK?"
"OK, let's do this."
Alright...
"OK, Dr. Conner, you are looking at perfectly healthy arteries."
There's no blockages here.
So it's not a heart attack.
No.
"OK, let's check the ventricles."
Wu-tang!
"Good morning, Master Law!"
Jun-kit...
Our students used to learn kung-fu as Shaolin monks.
Any better now?
"Yes, Master!"
Fung-wu!
Do all our students understand the mystery of the sword?
"Yes, Master!"
They all understand!
"Good morning, Master Law!"
Let's get together tonight at the old place.
I'll be the host.
"No, I should be the host!"
I will be the host!
I'll be the host!
I've told you I'll be the host!
I'll be the host!
Don't argue!
No...
I will!
Don't argue!
"I'll be the host, do you hear?"
Fung-wu...
What's happened to you?
There's nothing to argue about!
Don't snatch!
Who's the host really?
I am!
I am!
"Fung-wu, try to use our sword skills!"
"Jun-kit, attack him with the Shaolin fist!"

I thought we were through the hard times.
You know?
Mm-hmm.
"I'd been sick for about three months... uh, and he was just so amazing."
"He took such great care of me and the kids, and..."
- This is gonna sound weird. [Chuckles]
- Please.
My life?
No judgment.
L-lt's not that I wanted him to be sick or anything like that... but I...
I wanted... the opportunity... to show him that I could be there for him.
You know?
I haven't always been.
I've been going on and on.
You haven't.
This is what recovery is all about.
"You know, opening up, being honest."
Okay.
"So, tell me about you."
[Chuckles]
"Uh, recovering drunk."
"Wife, sister, mother."
"Two kids... boy, 10, girl, 8."
Uh...
I don't know.
Life gets pretty boring when you stop drinking.
What kind of work do you do?
[Sighs] Assembly line.
Boring.
- Come on.
I told you.
Together forever.
Together forever.
Together forever.
- Hey...
So what's up?
- Together forever.
I think we both may have said some things I might regret.
- Together forever!
"- Gosh, your eye is pretty!"
"Look, I know you're upset, so..."
Aah!
Why don't we just sit down... and discuss this?
Then... they ate me!
"Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee!"
They're gonna do that all the way home.
I...
I gotta go.
They're my ride.
Wait a minute.
"If they ate you, how is it that you're still here?"
Did you not say this was a true story?
Um...
"You made it up, didn't ya?"
"I... hey, look!"
Lord Farquaad's ghost!
Aah!
Doody heads!
And then there were three.
Who else wants to step up?
"I, too, have a terrifying tale to tell."
It was a dark and stormy night!
Hey... what the...
"10 years ago to this day, his father died here."
He was waiting for a train as he did every evening.
"He had a good job, happy family."
"And one evening, he'd had enough."
"And when the express came by, he jumped."
Was he a friend of yours?
"And these last few days,"
Dennis has come here every evening.
- Every evening.
- Do you ever answer a question?
Look at him.
- Why should I?
- Look at him.
"Because in about two minutes,"
Dennis there will be dead.
What the f...
You're crazy.
Completely crazy.
"You gotta take the Chambers Street Exit, right across the platform."
Look!
He's got a gun!
He's got a gun!
He's got a gun!
"Listen, don't do it!"
"Please, put the gun down!"
Is this your first time?
You seem kind of young.
He's here to see Dr. Kay.
- Okay.
- He'll come get you in the day room.
- This way?
- Mm-hmm.
- Will I?
"- Yeah, totally."
"You've got the pony bug now, and there's no cure for that."
- Granddaughter 1 returns.
- That's my girl.
Back in time for dinner.
"Okay, I've had the most insane day."
I don't know where to start.
Uh...
"Sam, she asked me to help with Raven, he's a horse."
"And Pin was like, ""Back off, tourist."""
- And I...
- You've been at the stables?
"It sounds like you had fun, whatever you were doing."
Everybody's actually kind of cool.
Apart from Mia...
I don't want you riding.
What?
Why?
Because I need you keeping an eye on Rosie.
- She could come with me.
- Rosie at a stable?
I don't think so.
Okay.
It's fine.
She doesn't have to be with me the whole time.
This isn't up for discussion.
I've got enough to worry about with Gramps and your dad and...
Just... promise me.
No riding.
Sure.
No riding.
"You will go back to school, won't you?"
"Well, if we was to go back to school, could we get as smart as Tia and Tony?"
- Maybe even smarter.
"- Yeah, sure."
Let's give it a shot.
Great.
I hope the school can take it.
"- Goodbye, Yo-Yo."
- Goodbye.
"- See you later, Yo-Yo."
- You promised.
"Tia, open the gate."
"No, everybody join hands."
Cool!
All right!
Flying saucer!
Will we ever see you again?
"Well, it's... it's kind of hard to say."
Thanks for everything.
And especially for letting me be in your gang.
"Take care of Alfred for me, OK?"
There you are.
- Where's your luggage?
"- Uh, we lost it."
There were a few problems.
- But you did have fun?
"- Oh, terrible."
I just knew we should have gone surfing.
Hey.
Let's do it the way Tia and Tony taught us.
Yeah.
- Ready?
And she became a billionaire.
Weren't you going to call Philip?
- Who do we know with money?
"- Philip, Jonas and Tommy."
Why?
We'II do what Anna Nicole Smith did.
Hook a guy with money.
- Sounds a bit risky to me.
- What else can we do?
Move to Virum and end up like Vanessa?
Add Bjarke to the list.
He's dying to screw me.
- Patricia?
- Sofie?
Where have you been?
- What happened?
- Simon's been really worried.
- I've been sleeping in the park.
- Why?
- I said no and that's that.
- I'm sick of you.
You never think of anyone but yourself and I'm sick of school...
I hate you.
"Stop it, Simon."
"I am not in the mood, OK?"
- She looks just like you.
- You creep!
You'd be great in porn.
You fuck just like her.
Didn't you hear mum?
She totally lost it.
What did she say?
"Joanie, I got a surprise."
"Oh, is it a food surprise?"
I love food surprises.
What on earth is that?
It's a mini-horse.
"Her name is Lemonade, and she's come to live in our house forever."
What?
- Isn't she great?
- No!
It looks like a child in an animal suit.
"Well, come on, give her a pet."
- (neighs) - (gasps)
Oh!
"Now, that's no way to treat family, Lemonade."
Be nice.
Aw...
Now you're just flirting to flirt.
She'll come around.
I promise you.
"Come on, girl."
Let's go night-night.

I just came to stop the fight.
He's fantastic!
Fantastic!
"I can't fight, I'm innocent."
You've cheated me.
Now you have taken my girls.
I haven't!
You don't have to deny it.
I understand!
Good!
Wu-tang will not lose to your Shaolin fist.
Shaolin?
Wu-tang?

Are you really good at kung-fu?
He's inferior to you!
Please excuse me!

I'm saved.
"Andy'll find you here, he'll take us back to the room and then you can tell everyone that this was all just a big mistake."
Huh?
Right?
Buddy?

That is a lot of money for a kid like you.
"Anybody asks you where you got it, you got it in Vegas playing craps."
"Check, sir."
"No, no, no."

There was nothing like it.
I didn't think there was anything strange in any of this.
"You know, a 21-year-old kid with such connections."
Guess he wasn't a person after all.
"V, Cash said that you took the money."
That's not true.
"I, I believe you, but... you got to tell Waltzer in person."
Um...
"T ell me where you are, and I'll come to you."
V?
Got to...
"Oh, shit."
Got to get out of here.
Okay.
Oh!
Excuse me.
"Sorry, excuse me."
Thank you.
Who do I need to find?
What am I doing?
"Uh, Dad."
Dad.
Find Dad.
"Um, excuse me."
I'm looking for Frank's father.
He's a teacher here.
"Oh, what's his goddamn name?"
"His name is, um..."

No.
Stay inside.
Stay safe.
Lifted it from the guards' latrine on cleaning duty.
What's it for?
Protection.
I won't allow it.
"Don't do anything daft, Danny."
How long does it take the guards to reach the far side?
Two minutes.
"OK, then."
"Two minutes from now, we run."
"Go, go, go."
Cut the wire!
Hey!
What are you doing?

I don't have time for this.
"I am sick, damn it!"
I'm the one that is out of time.
"Jacob, I am dying."
You have to stay and do what we have decided.
- Nothing has been decided.
- Anna will need you.
And Helene...
And the boys...
"They're so young, Jacob."
"Look at me, Jacob!"
Don't you see that there is a point to all of this?
"You have a responsibility here, Jacob."
Do I have to live on the other side of the world to get your help?
"Hi, Anna."
It's Jacob.
Would you please call me?
I need to speak to you.
Call as soon as you can.
I'm leaving now.
I have to go take care of my hubbie.
Anna?
Is something wrong?
- Can I sleep here?
"- Yes, of course."
"Anna, what happened?"
There.
- Hello.
"- Mrs. Shaw, it's Jacob."
"- Hi, Jacob."
Want to talk to Pramod?
"- No, just let him sleep."
I want to come with you.
"No, out of the question."
"You don't want to, Helene."
It's sons and their father in the woods.
Or else they'll turn out gay.
Promise to use a life vest and water wings.
And the boys too.
- Bye bye!
- Bye.
Hi.
- Can we talk?
- What do you want to talk about?
- We could start with Jorgen?
- Stop already.
Listen.
Can I come in?
Thanks.
- So talk about Jorgen.
- Can we sit down?
We could find a chair.
This is fine.
May I sit here?
Okay...
Did you know Jorgen asked me to administer a fund?
- No.
What fund?
- It's aid work.
With Anna.
- You'll run it with Anna?
- With Anna.
"It's a very generous offer, but he's dragging things out."
I want to know what's going on.
-In the back.
Gimme a bromo for my friend here.
"I'll take a small steak, two eggs on top some fries, juice, and a side order of toast...."
"Yes, sure."
Right away.
"Look out for that stomach, huh?"
Here we fix you up one second.
You'll feel much better.
Okay.
"See you, huh?"
We'll have your steak ready in a minute.
Where's my buddy?
"Oh, he left."
He left?
-What are you talkin' about?
"-Hey, what's a matter?"
You okay?
The guy drove off on me.
How are you gonna figure that?
"Oh, I think your steak's ready."
Thank you.
"Oh, no!"
-What?
-He took my wallet.
I left the raincoat in the car and....
I can't even pay you for this.
"Tell me, where you goin' anyway?"
-Down to L.A.
-Why?
I was goin' down for a job.
The whole thing's in the wallet.
-What kind of job?
Missed calls
- Shaman
What the hell?
What the...?
Hello.
It's me.
Where are you?
What about you?
Don't ask me anything.
You need to get to your daughter.
Now.
Tell me what's going on?
I'm at your place.
"Get back to your house, now."
First tell me what's going on.
L.
I misread the divination.
It's not him.
What are you talking about?
I cast the hex on the wrong ghost.
I saw a woman in front of your house.
I made a grave mistake.
"A terrible, terrible mistake."
It's not the Japanese man.
That woman is the evil spirit.
It was all her doing.
"So, go home now."
"I'm on my way there, too."
"Then""."
Who's the Japanese man?
He was trying to kill that woman in order to save people from her.
Understand?
What...
What is going on?
I needed to see you.
And this is how you do it?
Uh...
You abandoned me.
You walked away from me when I needed you the most.
- I'm sorry.
- That's not good enough!
"After the accident, I had to get my life together."
And what about my damn life?
It took me two years to get back on my feet.
You were the only thing that kept me going.
"Kaman, what happened to you?"
What do you think happened to me?
[Boy] Mommy?
Who else is here?
"Mommy, what's wrong?"
[Woman] That's my sister's son.
"Uh, go back upstairs, baby."
- Go back upstairs.
- Wait a minute.
Wait.
"He said ""Mama."""
"The boy's confused, Kaman."
Is that your son?
"[Tracy] No, Kaman."
Don't you stand in front of me and lie to my face.
"Kaman, drop it."
"You shoot me, I drop this, and they burn."
Then what?
"You move, you die."
"- So let's sit down, and we'll..."
"- Nope, stay on up here."
Really?
Do one more scenario.
"Maggie, you're at your car."
You're fumbling for your keys.
- Okay.
"- Emma, attack."
"Uh, okay, um, Mags, let's just take it easy..."
- [grunts]
- Ah!
- [grunting and yelling]
- You're dead!
She's still alive!
"Keep it moving, keep it moving."
"- No, no!"
"- I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead!"
Why are you still talking?
"Yeah, that's right."
Dead men tell no tales.
- [yells]
"- Oh, God!"
You're dead.
And that's self defense... [softly] For moms.

You don't want to go to that school.

"Yeah, that was neat."

"Tony, look through the window."
Is anything wrong?
I was scared by the lightning and Stan hasn't gotten home yet and I just didn't want to be alone in the house.
When do you expect him?
He didn't say when he'd be back.
I'm terribly sorry.
"But as you probably know, Lynn and I are concerned about Stan."
I had a feeling that something was wrong with Stan.
A hunch.
So I drove out to see if everything was okay.
- I'm sorry.
"- Of course, I understand."
It was nice to see you again.
"Bye-bye, Lynn."
"Douglas, what is it?"
I don't know.
I don't know.
I have a strange feeling something's wrong.
A feeling like I had when Bobby...died.

Stan?
Stan is here.
My brother is here.
And he's dead.
My brother is dead.
It could be Bobby.
No.

- It's along walk.
- Not if you know the trails.
See anyone go in or out of the farmhouse?
I don't like that place.
Nothing but ghosts around.
Can I go?
- How much do you get for Bambi?
- 250 pesetas a kilo.
Must be somebody famous.
Name's Obediah Jackson.
"Chris, let me see that."
"What's wrong, Nathan?"
Somebody you know?
He's my father.
Hyah!
NATHAN:
How much further to Eagle Bend?
Town's just over that rise.
We should take a look before we ride in.
[chattering ]
"Can't do this, sheriff."
"No disrespect, judge, but this is my town."
-Looks like a hanging party.
-Let me see.
To the right of the water tower.
NATHAN:
That's my father.
"Now, hold on, Nathan."
No sense riding into a lynch mob without a plan.
Let's do this together.
Come on.
Enough of this.
We don't need a trial.
Let's go.
Somebody grab some rope and tie up his hands.
-The man deserves a trial.
-l can walk. I'm a free man.
"Yeah, you're free to swing."
Get a rope.
Tie up his hands.
That's not living.
Okay.
- Call me when you get home safe?
- Mm-hm.
Okay.
"- Bye, Stefan."
- Goodbye.
Don't look at me like that.
- Are you crazy?
"- Save the lecture, look..."
Damn it.
I remember them.
From 1864.
They were in the tomb.
Yeah.
About that.
Matt.
- Matt.
"- I don't wanna hear it, Mom."
"Matty, please."
"Do you know what I was doing tonight, Mom?"
I was having fun.
Trying to forget about all the crap that I have to deal with every day.
Just enjoy a night with my friends.
"And then, there you are."
"Wasted at the bar, where I work, by the way to pay the bills that you don't pay."
And then you're off acting like a freaking kid?
Hooking up with some guy half your age.
"I'm the kid, Mom."
You're supposed to be responsible for me.
"I know, Matt."
How was your night?
I can fly?
"-Erik, please."
-The boy seeks the larger truth.
"If you want, must desire."
"If you wish, all you want is yours."
"Now, go."
Bye!
Bye!
Son.
Erik.
"You know, when everything goes wrong running away is not the solution."
Okay.
Need to find itself a way to solve.
-Right.
-All right.
And we are all different part of life to know who is and what their gifts.
You can not dance or fly but when you discover is all yours.
Got it?
"Yes, that's okay."
Great.
"-Will, what is this?"
It's the wave of change.
"The world is changing, Bill."
We have to get in on.
"My god, can not be."
Something somewhere gave the greatest hustle.
Something hit the land of the emperors.
"Come on, children."
Let's push the pace.
"-It's our time, Bill."
-Right.
"Swimming-and-death, my friend."
–Yeah.
Over here.
"While I was checking the bathroom, this tile fell off."
It looks directly into Kayla's bathroom.
"Oh, God."
"Oh, God."
We got to get an A.P.B out on their car.
Jesus.
–You okay?
–Better than you.
"Looks like I taught you my last lesson, huh?"
Don't end up like me.
I shouldn't have dragged you into this.
Going after that guy was the right thing to do.
"–Hell, I got you shot."
–I always knew there was a bullet with my name on it.
And guess what?
I'm still here.
So are you.
"Hey, you really ought to get in there and see him."
Yeah.
Me and Vic aren't really talkin' right now.
He'd want to see you.
–Yeah?
–Yeah.
"Hey, what the hell is going on?"
"We found the peephole, Bob."
–What are you talking about?
This is ridiculous.
–Step away!
–It's clean.
–Pop it.
You're so unreasonable.
Let me do my work first?
Only 2 photos left and I'm done.
Shit.
I can't breathe.
Hey body.
"You really mean to get back at me now, right?"
Bring it on.
I'm not afraid.
Death is a natural thing for me.
I used to think we should all design our own funerals.
I want my funeral... to not be at a temple.
It can be in this room.
Just a nice coffin and flowers.
I like TK a lot.
Never seen them live.
I would want them to sing at my funeral.
I want them to sing the song 'Handkerchief'.
It's a hit song so everyone can sing along.
Guest list.
Je
Kai
Pongsatorn
Mom
4 people.
That's it.
Not many.
I'm not sure whether I want the doctor to come or not.
"I am sorry, doc."
I...
I died.
I broke my promise.
I don't have time to argue with you.
I will take full responsibility for this.
This boy is gonna die!
Let's do it.
It's a great story.
Let's go!
- What are you doing?
- I need supplies.
- I need a portable defibrillator.
- I got a spare.
- You're taking a hell of a chance.
- Damn right!
Let's go!
Hold it right there.
Here we go.
"One, two, three."
There's no room in here.
Give me the camera.
- All set.
- Get a minicam van and meet me at County.
"Here, here."
Close the door.
Let's go!
Patch your headsets back to the station.
- How's he doing?
- He's okay.
- You're filming this?
- We're live from Chopper Five with Dr....
"- What's your name, doctor?"
- Doug Ross.
Dr. Doug Ross from County General.
Just minutes ago Dr. Ross rescued a boy from a storm drain.
Who is this?
Look at that.
Get in!
-Son Son.
-OK.
OK.
"Come on, boy."
Come here.
"Lu, what did you say this guy?"
Nothing.
He said you told him I I killed a woman and a child from that type.
What?
It's the same thing for you.
You're supposed to be representative Act.
What is this shit?
Fuck off.
Both.
Have you two last words you want to say to each other?
"Toni, I think it should be to kill them now."
"It will be tough for them outside,"
Since they will not know how to handle them.
Maybe Ray is killed while resisting arrest.
Came home late at night...
Burglar could kill him.
"Uneasily with you, boy?"
Get up!
You look uncomfortable.
I'm sorry.
What?
-I'm sorry.
-What did you say?
"I will not kill you, son."
Put me down.
Put me down!
Henry.
"They underestimate you, okay?"
Let them get close and then engage.
Engage!
No.
Henry!
Fight back!
Come on!
"No, stop it!"
- You stop it!
Stop it!
- What?
- Stop it!
- Estelle...
No!
"You're a fucking rabbit in the headlights, aren't you?"
It's all right.
I'm not here to hurt you.
Is your speech module installed?
Shit.
"Well, at least we know you're not deaf."
"It's all right, you can put your hands down now."
3 years I've been waiting for this moment and I get Charlie fucking Chaplin.
"Fuck's sake, come on!"
"All right, let's have a look at you."
"Open the glove box, please."
Take out that whole contraption.
You gotta untangle the wires.
Is that a wedding ring?
Are you... are you married?
Ready.
Start.
Don't look down on me!
Damned guy.
Mada mada da ne.
Go home.
Ku'so!
Ugh!
What the hell?
What you doing?
When did you come here?
"Anyway, get out."
"Scared you, didn't I?"
"Scared you, didn't I?"
Get out.
It's been a long time since we were in the bath together.
That's disgusting.
I feel like getting out of here right now.
You're blushing.
You're shy?
Your skin's so thin?
Who's the one that wants to get out?
- Tell me clearly.
- Shuddap.
When we were bathing together while you were young didn't you like to put your legs like this?
- What kind of joke was that?
"- It hurts, it hurts."
You're early.
The English test turned out bad.
- No doubt about that.
It was horrible.
- I thought it was okay.
Nothing else?
Well.. she couldn't care less about who were you dating.
That she only cared about when you're with me.
And that she weren't calm we I'd leave.
What does Clara mean by that?
I want to meet Luisa.
Do you want to know how is she?
-Yes.
Luisa sings.
Does she play the guitar?
I don't think so.
Why not if she sings?
She doesn't sings modern songs.
She sings opera?
-Yes.
She's studying.
She haven't performed yet.
Then Berta was right.
She's much younger than you.
She is exactly 23 years old.
Much younger than mom.
And even younger than Berta!
He's 18.
He's studying economics.
He's 5 years older than you?
And what do you talk about?
Dunno.
About everything.
What do you talk with Luisa?
About everything too.
But it's not the same.
Why not?
Go sightseeing?
If it's a nice day?
"-Yeah, let's do that."
-Okay.
"And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie."
Okay?
"Oh, I love you."
"I love you, Rags."
"We'll have a good day, yeah?"
"You can bring Mr. Dennings, if you like."
Mr. Dennings?
"Well, you know, it's okay."
"Well, thank you very much but why on earth would I wanna bring Burke on your birthday?"
"Well, you like him."
"Yeah, I like him."
Don't you like him?
"Hey, what's going on?"
What is this?
"-You're gonna marry him, aren't you?"
"-Oh, my God."
Are you kidding?
-What?
-Me marry Burke Dennings?
Don't be silly.
Of course not.
Where did you ever get an idea like that?
But you like him.
Of course I like him.
"I like pizzas too, but I'm not gonna marry one."
You don't like him like Daddy?
"Regan, I love your daddy."
"I'll always love your daddy, honey."
We have to come up with something.
It won't be easy.
He'll think of something.
"Come, I'll help you."
I'm sure he would've taken us to the embassy in Sofia.
"No way, Louise."
The Turks may take offence at the King's frolic.
It may result in a diplomatic incident.
He would've taken us to Istanbul to avoid a scandal.
We are going home.
In an ambulance.
"Ludovic, the filming has to stop."
- Sire?
- I want to drive the car.
Excuse me?
You heard me.
- I will miss you.
- Jump in.
Han Solo springt in den Millennium Falcon.
- Hi.
- Hi.
And my donut?
END
I think he had a heart attack.
- We write a song.
- We write a song.
"- It is called ""boat"". - ""Boot""."
He goes so ...
Let's sing it simple.
Stop to sit at home and mope.
I can not bear.
It's repulsive.
Hospital graveyard.
- Maybe you should get it.
- Me?
Come on.
- Maybe you can come some good.
- So what is it that will help?
"- You're a cop, John."
I would be safe.
"- No one is safe benleyken, Rache."
Thank you.
- Where is Mike?
- There were some things he has to do.
- Work like?
"- Yes, I like business."
- You bring me Bella.
"- Yes, I brought."
- Who are you?
- My name is John.
"Brother, I wanted to look after a while."
- Do you always sleep with him?
- His name is Bella.
She is a girl bear.
"- My brother, say I'm too big for him."
- I never would not be very large.
Try to sleep a little.
- Will you tell me a story?
- I do not know any story.
Then we make up one.
My mother does this.
"Once upon a time, once upon ..."
Long long time ago ...
"Once upon a time, once upon ..."
Over.
Copy that.
Why did you let one of DI Orwell's stooges in on this?
I thought you and Ben were finally getting it together.
We're still working it out.
"Oh, he's a good cop, apparently."
It's just a shame that Orwell got him.
- How do you ever know?
- Know what?
- If someone's right for you?
- I don't know why you're asking me.
"I, er, suppose you just do."
"But when you do, make sure you hold onto it."
- Approaching now.
- Copy that.
Wait till he's past the jetty then head in with the light on.
What's he doing?
"Oh, Jesus."
Police!
Stop!
"Kevin Grey, on your knees now."
Ben!
Grey!
Put your weapon down.
You're surrounded.
They set me up!
Rrar!
Let's go.
"Go, go, go."
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
"- Ben, are you hit?"
It was a dark and stormy night...
Gingy?
My girlfriend kicked me out.
"You know, something about me being too into myself."
You?
But you are so adorable.
"I know, that's what I keep telling her!"
"I need a good woman, Muffin Man."
"I can help you, Gingy."
How about this one?
- I don't know.
- You like her?
No.
Weird hair.
- How about this one?
- Too skinny.
No!
Don't like it!
OK.
"Well, how about this one?"
Yes!
That's it!
She's perfect.
The girl of my dreams.
Wait.
More sugar.
But that is not the recipe.
"Trust me, Muffin Man, this girl's gotta be real sweet."
I want someone who will love me forever.
"I must warn you, Gingy."
No one has ever made cookies with this much sugar.
You are tampering with forces far beyond your comprehension!
- Nitrous?
"- Yes, please."
No.
More booze for me.
Seems all right?
"""Seems"" being the operative word, mate."
This will cheer you up.
"Shame Felix can't be here, he's always talking about you guys."
Really?
Yeah.
"I mean, you're his friends, right?"
"Yes, we are his very, very, very good friends, aren't we?"
Good old Mr. Felix.
"So, tell us about Chile."
Musta been a big decision.
"Uh, the family thought it would do him good."
Toughen him up finally.
Make him big and strong like his big brother.
"Oh, my God."
You have to feel this.
"It's like a rock, Gemma."
You'll have to excuse her.
- She isn't house-trained.
"- No, seriously, come on, have a big..."
- I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.
I'll sort it out.
My God.
Go on.
"Oh, sorry."
"Hi, there."
You've got a lot of scars.
Stop crying and tell me what you want.
I want to listen to Macarena!
There's going to be music here soon.
Their music?
Yuck!
I want Macarena!
"Sing the song you sang the other day, aunty."
Not today.
I have an irritation in my throat today.
No one sings a song when we assemble for it!
Yes.
Some can't sing and some have a bad throat.
Sharma!
You can't even speak!
How will you sing?
"You sing a song, aunty."
Yes.
"Sing for us, Laxmi."
What was that?
Pali or Sanskrit?
"Explain the meaning of the song to us, Laxmi."
Very well.
It was fun...
I see you wearing that for the first time.
You look great.
"Is it only for today, or..."
"Don't get excited, aunt."
What's a matrimonial necklace with so many others?
Aunty...
Yes?
Yes?
God!
You'll live longer wearing my suit.
Make one for yourself.
24 inches!
Must be a good fighter.
Thank you.
Three foot!
What kind of cuff you like?
Wen's style.
6-inch cuffs.
2-foot splits and 5-foot-long suit.
1.8 foot for shoulders.
30 inches waist.
What are the needles for?
The secure your button.
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.
Let me measure your neck.
Have you finished?
I would have if you had cooperated.
What else you want to do?
Choose the material.
I'll take the piece on your hand.
Cut it.
I know you're the Demon Tailor!
Why do you want to kill me?
My Big Brother Tam King is angry with you.
Can you tell Mr. Tam?
"I want to be his friend, Liang Foon!"
Master!
- Give him his scissors!
"- Yes, Master!"
It's difficult to clean.
"When I was a kid, a tenement on our block collapsed."
Buried some people alive.
"From then on, every time I passed that spot,"
I believed I could always hear them moaning and crying for help.
You through there?
Get started upstairs.
"Why don't you go to bed, Stan?"
Why should I?
Because you make me sick to my stomach.
Douglas...
"All right, Stan."
"You've had enough, let's go."
Mr. Gordon will excuse you.
Let's go.
Excuse me?
Do you think I had too much to drink?
"Whoa, wait."
Wait a minute.
Wait.
"Good night, my dear."
Mr. Gordon.
"Let's go, Dougie."
Come on.
Here we go.
I want to show you that I can be neighbourly too.
Lynn?
"Well, he's in bed."
Probably dead to the world by now.
"Thank you, Doug."
"Good night, Gordon."
It's been a pleasure.
- Thank you.
Whoo!
I'm right...
First big piece!
First big piece.
It just went up the hose.
After empty searches.
And near-death dives.
And with the weight Of the pomrenke empire.
On his shoulders...
Mr. Gold strikes again.
Shawn Has finally found gold.
Where his dad always Doubted he would.
Whoo!
I've dealt with setbacks My whole life.
"And, you know, You don't give up."
You just keep pushing forward.
"Yeah, buddy!"
"Yeah, buddy!"
Hard work pays off.
Yeah!
"Flip that flap up, and let's See what it looks like."
Look at that!
Yeah!
Look at that nugget!
- Wow!
- -holy.
That's a big Nugget there.
"Now for the pomrenke name, The sky is the limit."
There's a lot of gold Off this ground.
There's gold at the bluff.
So dad can't give Me anymore.
"100 miles west,"
maybe he thought it was worth the risk.
"Listen, mate."
We weren't sent here to take on the coppers.
"Listen, mate."
We weren't sent here to take on the coppers.
Got it?
Got it?
"Hello, Ray."
"Hello, Ray."
Long time no see.
Long time no see.
Oooh.
Oooh.
"Hey, thought you might have put your roots down, mate."

"Sorry, boys."
I've got nothing on.
"Sorry, boys."
"Oh, grow up, Robin."
There's no such thing as ghosts.
"Nate, can you please help me?"
Technically...
He's right.
- What?
- Yes.
I... but you're also right.
It feels...
Very wrong.
- Yeah.
- But that is not for you to judge.
"You know, if... if he wants to do this..."
I do.
"And she, for some reason, wants to do this..."
"- Yes, please."
- Nate:
And she approves...
"- Yes, of course."
- Then...
"Well, it sounds like we just completed our vows."
"Robin, let's make this official."
Somebody please object.
I object!
Because I love her!
- [Speaks Russian]
- I know so much about you!
I know you like snack chips.
I like snack chips!
You're a side sleeper.
"I'm a side sleeper, right?"
You read a magazine on the potty.
"Bro, I don't know what to say, man."
"I mean, I hear you, bro, I hear you."
"But the fuck, bro?"
"What if that's his life, man, that's him."
That's his life?
That's my life...
"That's my boy, you understand?"
"You know, he took that from me."
He took that shit from me.
"Yes, Mr. Rodriguez?"
Can I use the bathroom?
"Come on, Michael, just go."
You don't have to interrupt.
"Oye, papa, ven!"
What's up?
Damn.
"What happened, huh?"
Damn!
Rodriguez?
"Does this look like a beet salad, hmm?"
This just came back.
My best salad just came back looking like that.
"Yo, I don't know..."
This is unacceptable.
Fix me a new one...
now.
Is there a problem?
"All right, where do you think you're going..."
Come on...
*
"You know, it doesn't look that bad."
I actually think it looks kind of cute.
He kept talking about some broad called Nancy.
Kept talking about some broad called Nancy.
I guess that must be you.
I guess that must be you.
OK...
Action!
"Girl, the kid's pretty messed up."
Kept talking about some broad called Nancy.
I guess that must be you.
"To which, she replies,"
"""I'm Rose."
This is Nancy.
"The Nancy."" To which you say..."
Rose.
"Did you know, if one were twenty years younger and differently inclined, one might be almost be tempted."

Catrin?
Cat...don't make me run.
"They're always going to be like that, aren't they?"
"Younger, in awe of you."
Like I was?
Aw!
Cmon Cat.
You had a choice.
You didn't choose me.
I'll come back in a few days and we'll mend things.
Oh!
For God's sake.
Across the street?
That's where I was born.
Salute.
Kid got a nice mother?
"She's the sweetest, kindest, most beautiful woman I've ever known."
Why?
"Well, 'cause daddy ain't gonna live long drinking like that."
"Hey, don't even talk to me like that, man."
"It's a celebration tonight, and I don't need to hear that."
Robbie.
"Hey, Sonny."
"Tell me, boy or girl?"
I got a son.
"That's great, man."
Let's go see the family.
Why don't you have a drink with me first?
The doc wants them to rest up for a little while.
Everything okay?
Everything's all right.
"Julia, she's just knocked out, though."
She was in labor for 15 hours.
You're kidding me.
I'm not kidding.
How's the kid?
How's the kid?
He's great.
Black Jack.
That's terrific.
How much did he weigh?
"Eight pounds, six-and-a-half ounces."
Wow!
You got yourself a big boy.
Enough.
Do you want vada?
You mean firebrand?
OK
Hey why is a thread coming out of it?
-Got torn.
I only stitched it together.
- You stitched it?
Yes
Where is the chef?
It's one week since he left for hometown.
Then what about this vada?
"Well, he made it before leaving."
Oh!
Damn you all.
Why did you leave the table?
- I want to live a little longer.
- He is Das.
- OK thanks.
- Well I have a client approaching in the morning itself.
Yes I am Das.
Haridas.
- The best house broker in South India.
-What can I do for you?
-I am Karthik.
-So what?
- I am a lawyer and I need a house for rent.
A lawyer?
- You look too timid.
Can you raise your voice?
"- Yes, I can."
It's very difficult to find a house for a lawyer.
It's quite a nice old place.
At least the roof doesn't leak.
"To your health, my lord."
And your delightful family.
(Lord Meldrum) Thank you.
Do we eat this or is just for ornamentation?
"Give it to Foster, he'll crawl up it."
(Clears throat)
"Er, well, how have you all been keeping?"
"Fine, fine."
(High-pitched) Fine.
Good.
Good.
"My nephew's, er, had the chickenpox."
"Oh, poor little chap."
How old is he?
27.
"Dinner is served, m'lord."
"Come on, you're sitting next to me."
- Mr Foster.
- Oh.
Thank you very much.
"- I'm honoured, my lady."
"- Please, call me Cissy."
"Come along, Teddy."
Show Mr Barnes where he's sitting.
Oh.
"Yes, of course."
Erm... been in any good pubs lately?
"You see, my Olive doesn't like me coming home breathing beer fumes."
"You can't blame her, can you?"
That's the soup gone up.
-l tell her 20 times!
-l'll take the dog.
The dog's not going to a pound.
You got a green card?
-You want to see?
"-No, get out of here."
Take off.
SUPER:
He's crazy.
What that has to do with my green card?
Ridiculous.
-We better go talk to Roberts.
-Let's tell Mike.
Like he doesn't know.
"Poor kid. I tried to straighten her out. i mean, I really tried."
-l even prayed for her.
You believe it?
-Talk about last night.
"I saw her a lot, you know, maybe too much."
"Maybe I even loved her a little, even, you know, like..."
... takingcareof herand everything and making sure she was safe.
"-That kind of love, know what I mean?"
"-Last night, Mike."
ROBERTS:
What about it?
She died.
-When did you see her last?
Yesterday. I saw her with you guys.
You guys saw.
You didn't see her after that?
"Hey, what are we, gonna go bare knuckles here?"
-What do you want me to say?
Always has been.
Good night.
What about the mouth thing we'd talked about?
- Mouth thing?
- I want to show off my new skills.
- Not right now.
- Go to sleep and I'll go to work.
- Can't we just...
"- Okay, I'll back off."
Sleep tight.
- I'm not ready for the tournament.
- You sure aren't.
- Did you give Mia head then?
- You're disrupting my swing!
It just occurred to me.
Try it out.
"If it works, I've got another trick."
- Just a little one.
- Could you open the door a little?
Well put!
It's all about opening the door and ringing the bell.
- Isn't that Mia's brother?
- Mads?
Yes.
"- Hi, Mads."
- Hi.
- Nice guy.
"- Yes, and one hell of a lawyer."
- Hi.
How was your swing?
- Fine.
I just bought a painting marketed as being mouth painted.
Put your hands up.
Would you mind?
Thank you.
How nice to hear from you.
Of course.
"Yes, that shouldn't be too difficult, sir."
You would prefer it in the morning?
By all means.
Yes.
Good night.
I want that in the diplomatic pouch to Lisbon this afternoon.
- And on to Berlin?
- As soon as possible.
Fine.
May I ask you...
It's insurance.
You don't come to us very often.
- Not very.
- You keep to yourself.
A cautious man.
A cautious life.
"But then, how else could one survive these days?"
One could stop.
But not you.
Training.
- Patriotism.
Good.
"- Here, please."
"Pull in here, cabby."
Thank you.
"Do you know what these are, Godliman?"
American aircraft.
- Oh baby.
- I missed you so much.
"I missed you too, my darling."
I've missed you too.
We're gonna do that.
We're gonna swing.
We're going to be a family again.
Always.
"Marcus,"
Will you take me back?
"well, i don't know."
- That's all right.
- I need to think about it a little bit.
- Oh.
Oh.
"- Regina: see, i told you."
I thought about it.
Yes.
Oh marcus.
Oh!
Oh.
Mom.
"Oh, y'all go on."
I got this.
This house is busier than grand central station.
- Who is it now?
- Man: papa joe's furniture emporium.
"Well, what you want?"
We don't have anything else for you to take.
"Mama, you let them come in here and take whatever they want,"
Because everything i need i already have right here.
- Come and take it all.
Come in.
Take a look around.
It's fine.
-No. I couldn't.
-You can.
Let me get you something.
All I have is water and OJ. I hope that's all right.
What about the champagne?
"I mean, if you want to."
Sure. I guess a little champagne between colleagues never hurt.
"You know, Pacey Witter, you are such a doll."
I have so much respect for you having the strength not to act on this thing.
-And what thing would that be?
-You know the thing.
This heat.
I felt it tonight when you hugged me.
I felt it that time when we kissed.
"-Oh, gee!"
"-Shut the door, Pacey."
It'll keep the heat in.
Audrey.
Audrey!
"Audrey, stop."
Let me explain.
I don't wanna hear your explanations.
-lt's clear to me.
-She just dropped by.
And you were trying so hard to get her to leave.
-lt is not what it looks like.
-Go back!
-Nothing happened!
-You kissed her!
She's got a Firebird and two horses!
We could've raced 'em!
All right.
That's it.
I'm gonna go askJake Bradley.
I know.
"We've all been thinking it, but no one's had the guts to ask him... 'cause he's the quarterback, and we're a bunch of jelly heads."
But you know what I say?
I say we shoot for the stars.
And that star is Jake Bradley!
Jake Bradley!
"All right, Fez."
There's Nina.
"Now remember, you're a new man."
You don't need her or anything else.
- Got it.
"I am cooler, suaver, aloofer."
- There you go.
"- Oh, hi, Fez."
"- Oh, you wish, baby."
"Why don't you take your ""Hi, Fez"" act and try it on someone else?"
'Cause I don't need it.
"- Nice work, Fez."
- Shut up.
I don't need your accolades.
"How can you give away your stuffing recipe, Kitty?"
It's the one thing that we have that's better than everyone else's.
Our house?
Crappier.
Our son?
Crappier.
Our stuffing?
Harry.
"What are you doing here, Bea?"
"- Oh, Harry, then you're not..."
- Not what?
"Oh, I don't know."
I had the strangest feeling.
- I thought...
- Yes?
You thought?
That you were going away without ever seeing me again.
"Well, why would I do that, Bea?"
- I love you.
Why...
"- Oh, I know."
"But I lost you for a moment, Harry."
- I was afraid.
- But you're not afraid now?
Of course not.
"Well, you see that everything's all right nothing has happened, that I'm the same as I ever was?"
Of course.
- It must have been a dream.
"- Yes, yes, a dream."
You're not angry with me?
Angry?
"Oh, I don't want you to leave me."
Ever.
"Oh, darling."
I love you so much.
- Please don't send me away.
- No.
"Yes, Father?"
It's a good thing I was worried about your behavior tonight.
- Oh!
- Lucy... and Robert!
"Yes, they..."
They were married a week ago and are now on their way to Plymouth.
(LAUGHTER)
"I am a joke to you, and an offence to her."
- I had no right to come.
"- Oh, Edward!"
- Where are you going?
- Far enough not to cause her more pain.
Pain?
Oh!
"Go to her, Edward."
"She is just out of her wits, that's all."
(LAUGHS) And so are you.
Go on.
Lucy took him for his money.
My mother's settlement cannot be revoked.
- And a fitting pair they make.
- I was a free man.
"I rode down here to marry you, and marched in upon you like a clumsy brute."
No.
Even now that I am asking for your hand...
- Are you?
- Yes.
And blundering again.
- I love you.
"- Oh, Elinor."
But you will have to ask my mother's consent more gracefully.
"Oh, yes."
Colonel.
"Oh, I am so happy to welcome you."
You said so.
"He gives that appearance, yes."
"But in disturbances of this sort, we can't always be sure."
"No, I'm afraid John has to stay here."
But he can't.
We need him.
The business.
I must take him home.
You'd only be taking home his body.
His mind is...
Look for yourself.
I hope that ending was properly terrifying.
What's this?
Nothing but sawdust.
"Oh, well, two can play at that game."
That's all I have here.
This concludes our program for tonight.
"On our next program, we shall both be back."
Me and my shadow.
Good night.
ANNOUNCER:
With the stars... and...
Alice.
Where is it?
Where-where is it?
Can I see him?
I keep him in the bedroom
-'cause it's warmer in there.
-Oh.
"Oh, okay."
-(coos)
"Yeah, One-Take Dennings stayed behind while I went to New York."
"Yeah, One-Take Dennings stayed behind while I went to New York."
- There you go.
- Handsome.
He is.
"What, do you want me to lie?"
You want me to make this commentary a sham?
What?
You didn't have to get me any present.
"So the history of the name, Oz-rael..."
- Look at that betrayal on my face.
Yes.
- I want a poster of that.
I actually...
I got a little copy of it.
Of course you did.
You have a copy of this CD?
"No, I have like the JPEG."
Just because it's funny.
Yeah?
Serious?
"Oh, that means so much."
That means so much.
Thank you so much.
Really?
Really?
"- This was Jay's last day, huh?"
"- Oh, was it?"
Look at the way he's looking at you.
"- Yeah, it's all fake."
- Jay showed up this day having been in Hawaii shooting...
"- Oh, right."
- He's all I can look at right now.
- Look at those eyes.
"- Oh, yeah."
- There we go.
I love how my head is 800 times the size of your head.
- That's a beautiful shot.
- This is love.
Love happening.
- It is.
- Look at those eyes.
"- Thank you, Tom Richmond."
"- Thank you, Tom."
- Was that the blond girl?
- She just walked by.
"Oh, man, I missed her."
We go to the same dentist together.
- Zac Booth is also very handsome.
- Yeah.
- It's true.
- Everybody's handsome.
- All the guys are handsome.
- Good-looking group.
- Zac Booth has incredible hair.
"- Yeah, he does."
"- I mean, a great guy too."
- Look at that.
It's kind of...
"See, there's no Rafi, because they knew that if you were on-screen, it'd be distracting."
Look at your punim.
"- Oh, squeeze it."
- Stop it.
I wanna mention that Rafi tried to do a mean thing to me in Toronto.
Do you always have to be such a hero?
What?
What's that?
What?
What's that?
Bank statement.
"You didn't tell me you deposited 10,000."
Bank statement.
"You didn't tell me you deposited 10,000."

What's this?
What's this?
It's them.
It's them.
They're trying to compromise me.
They're trying to compromise me.
"Get it out of the bank, Barbara."
"Get it out of the bank, Barbara."
"Take it out, get rid of it, give it to charity - anything."
"Take it out, get rid of it, give it to charity - anything."
I don't care.
"Just do it now, Barbara."
I don't care.
"Just do it now, Barbara."
Shit.
Shit.
Shit.
Shit.
We can't.
We have to.
We can't.
We're just sitting here.
Let's go there tonight.
Let's make them pay for this.
"Sure, sure now we're doing drive bys."
Just like a fucking street gang.
Then what are we going to do?
I don't know?
I don't know?
"You know if you put your gun away, it will help you bury your cousin."
Italian
"wow, wow."
What did you call me?
"All right, all right."
Enough.
Enough.
What did you call me?
"Dino, dino."
"Dino let him up, dino!"
Are you listening to me?
Are you trying to kill him?
Shut up Vic.
"Yes, I'm trying to kill him."
I will kill him.
God damn it.
"Rudy just give the man what he wants, huh?"
Did I hear you say you were sorry?
Tell him?
Did I hear you say I'm sorry?
Did I hear you say I'm sorry?
Jesus Christ.
"Did I hear you say you're sorry, huh?"
I'm sorry.
"Yeah, that's my lady."

Jump in.
You'll get soaked.
"Oh, blooming' heck!"
I knew this was comin'.

It's for your patient.
Ain't my patient.

Bit of a fog in here.
She were a cracker 40 year ago.
Do you think he's ready for this?
"If it gets him from the bed to the chair, it's a start."
"He mustn't put any weight on the ankle, though."
Do be careful.

I'll see you in a week or so.

Hey.
Come on.
It's an aftershock...
it'll stop in a second.
Pancakes !
"Oh, my God."
Kirsten ?
Kirsten ?
"Over here, Mr. Cohen."
Sandy.
Something is not right.
Nothing works.
It's like an information blackout.
"Well, the aftershock probably took out a power line or something."
"So listen, I'm going to go on foot and get help, I think."
"No, no, no."
"Well, we can't stay here."
I don't even know where here is.
"Well, I'm going with you."
"No, it's cool."
"Listen, I'm going to come back as soon as I can."
Promise.
What about the zombies ?
That's a really good point.
Okay.
"All right, buddy."
We have to keep you alert and on your feet.
"Now, when last we checked the list..."
Need some help ?
Yeah.
...we were on Trey.
Mm-hmm.
Would you like to purchase?
Hey.
Hey.
You're not knocking anymore?
I'm sorry.
What are you doing?
Uh...just busy.
You're always busy.
That's the price of fame.
"I gotta go, Dad."
They found Ryan.
Or spotted someone who meets his description.
There was a fight down by the pier.
Really?
Which means he's probably still in the area.
We should go try to find him before the authorities do.
Before he gets into any more trouble.
"Actually, do you need me to go?"
I was going somewhere.
Seth.
He's your friend.
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey!
So what's up?
You've been all weird-acting lately.
Yeah?
I don't know.
I guess...
It's just...
Do you ever wonder what your life looks like through someone else's eyes?
I shouldn't know about this?
A mother can't know about this?
"- No, I just mean..."
- You're graduating.
- I know.
- So we're here to see you graduate.
This is Raul.
So you and Raul are just here to see me graduate.
Don't be silly.
Your father will be joining me later.
- My father?
- Yes.
Remember him?
"Tall, bow tie."
"I remember Dad, Mom."
I just...
Rory told you.
Yes.
"That's okay, isn't it?"
It's a little late if it's not.
"No, it's perfectly fine that you're here."
Absolutely.
I'm just surprised.
- Who are you?
- I'm Raul.
- I just told you that.
"- Did Rory invite Raul, too?"
Raul is my cameraman.
Cameraman?
He'll be filming the ceremony for us.
He's very talented.
He screened an independent film of his as an audition.
Tommy!
They opened up the books.
Paulie got the okay.
Can you believe that?
This little Guinea bastard.
He's getting made.
We'll work for this guy one day.
He's gonna be a boss.
I can't believe it.
I'm really happy for you.
That's great.
Congratulations.
"Motherfuckers, we got them now."

Fuck him!
I want my money.
"Henry, I want my fuckin' money!"
I've had it up to here!
That cheap cigarette hijacking Mick.
"-No, fuck him!"
I want my money!
-Good.
Go tell him.
"Are you gonna keep your mouth shut, or what?"
Huh?
"Morrie, you're gonna get your money."
You just got to stop busting balls.

How's the investigation?
Found the Scorpion Yong?
"If he didn't attack us, we wouldn't have lost to him."
I find it strange.
Like someone is leading us in circle.
Does that tattoo guy really exist?
"That message from Lo Keung, is it real?"
What good is it to Lo?
He got us to meet Scorpion Yong.
To have him kill us.
Okay.
Someone's pulling the strings to do it to us.
Good partners.
"I'm hungry, let's eat first."
Waiter!
"Michael, how did you piss off Scorpion Yong?"
What?
He's bringing his men come to you.
How does he know I am here?
"You can pay me, so can he."
How do you know where I am?
Your Lamborghini is hard to miss.
This is my favour to you.
Run now.
I'll take a fucking bar to you!
"Good morning, Father."
"I'm gaining on you, you little fucker!"
"I'll rip your fucking head off, you little bollix."

"- Oh, I'll be reasonable."
I'll be very reasonable.

"Oh, shit!"
"Oh, fuck!"

Life... huh?
Is that what you call it?
"Start leading one, instead of following one around."
You're the one who's topping himself.
But where do I put it?
The pupil's gone.
Your eye just looks like a ping-pong ball.
I think it rolled up into my head.
"Look, just... just do the other one."
(screaming)
You look like one of those blind jazz guys.
Where are you?
I can't see anything.
(screaming)
I don't like this.
Just wear your stupid glasses.
"Chris, I'm blind."
"I'm sorry, Meg."

What the hell is all this?
"This is history, Brian."
A key moment in the history of happiness.
Have a seat.

"Mom, I'm in Istanbul..."

"Oh, I see dad wants some coffee."
"Mom, I have to go now."
Clients...
Bye mom.
"Watch out, God damn it!"
How many have you broken so far.
Enough with your morning tempers.
"Get away from me, you asshole!"
"Auntie, what do you find in that animal?"
That's exactly what I like in him:
The animal in my bed.
Take down those pictures.
I'm sure they drive him crazy.
"Well, he hates me anyway."
He can fuck off...
I'll kick him out soon.
Is this forthe rent?
It's been 9 months and I still don't have a job...
Cavit still asks about you...
"Oh, he is disgusting!"

Yes!

Out of my life!
You're fucked in the head.
It's in your mind.

-You got a problem.
Go ahead.
Go to your ready-made whores.
That's all that you're good for!
Get out of my life!

"Spider, what's your rush?"
"Thank you, Spider."

Mm.

"Excuse me, I've gotta see a patient."
- Taxi?

"No, no, uh..."
That dame just dropped this purse.
"- Well, I'll see that she gets it."
"- Uh-uh, uh-uh."
Ha-ha.
"No, I think she'd like me to have it."
[BUZZES]
What is it?
"Yeah, you're the doll."
You dropped this in the Randolph Hotel.
"- I tried to catch you, but you were too fast."
"- Oh, thank you."
I didn't miss it until I got home.
I wondered where I lost it.
"Won't you, uh, come in a minute?"
[CHUCKLES]
Who could say no?
"Oh, it's all there."
All I wanted was the card.
I didn't mean it that way.
"I was looking for a reward for you, but I'm afraid I haven't got enough."
Excuse me.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
What's the matter with you?
Did you get bit?
Huh?
"Say something, dammit."
He's the criminal.
"You're scaring me, man."
Snap out of it.
It wasn't just one or two people.
He took pictures of them when they were alive- and then went back for more when they went crazy and died.
What the hell are you going on about?
He's the criminal.
That's enough.
I'll deal with you later.
I'm sure of it.
He...
He took his victims' belongings and did something with them.
What did you see?
Tell me!
Jeon Hyo-jin
You're getting all wet!
Where is Hyo-jin?
In the living room.
Hyo-jin.
You're home early.
Did you lose your trainer?
"No, why?"
"What's this, then?"
It's not mine.
Isn't this your handwriting?
"I was with Chris, I swear."
It's him.
You want to ask him?
You can ask him.
Chris?
Jenna knows everything.
I didn't tell her.
Michael?
Hello?
You don't want me to talk to him?
"Why, is that because you're a lying piece of shit?"
"I didn't do anything wrong, Jenna."
Who is she?
- What are you talking about?
- I want to know who she is.
"You're blowing this way out of proportion, baby."
"Who were you with, Michael?"
This girl I met.
It was nothing.
It was nothing.
This girl I met.
It was nothing.
It was nothing.
Did you have sex with her?
Tell me.
"Did you cheat on me, asshole?"
I kissed her.
"It was one kiss and it meant absolutely nothing, baby!"
I did such a stupid thing!
- It was a stupid thing.
I'm so sorry.
"- You make me sick, you fucking slut."
Abduct the mandible.
- I need to sit down.
- Don't move.
- V-tach.
"- All right, I'm in."
"Let go, Gallant."

"C- spine, chest and pelvis."
"Gallant, why don't you go get yourself some air?"
Want a facial CT?
"Yeah, good idea."
Why don't we get a full head series?
Call RT.
Let's get a vent.
"Give him four of Ativan, seven of Pav."
"Nice work, John."
Bet that was a new one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Look, I'm sorry."
I just thought I was gonna be sick.
It's better if you keep your head down.
It'll be okay.
"It just caught me by surprise, you know?"
Relax.
Take a minute.
"You know, sometimes I don't think I can do this."
Are you gonna call me?
I'll call you.
"Unlock the door, Jenna."
I'm packing.
Come back later.
The house will be empty.
No.
You have to come talk to me.
Things are not going to end like this.
- Like I did this.
Move your foot.
- I panicked.
I made a huge mistake.
Fuck!
"Jenna, open the door!"
Michael?
- Is anything wrong?
- Everything's fine.
I locked myself out.
"- Jenna, you're having our baby!"
"- Yeah, well, maybe I won't keep it!"
"Don't you ever say that, Jenna."
Don't ever say anything like that ever again!
I can do whatever the hell I want.
"We're not married, remember?"
"- We're both free, just like you wanted."
- I made a mistake.
You're right.
"Too late, man."
Move your goddamn foot.
Hi.
"Hi, darling."

"I don't think that's a red herring, because it's right in the corner."
So let's pick that one out.
Have you got Blane?
Is that Oban?
Let's try and think of small places.
"Dumbarton, is Dumbarton in there?"
No.
Is there Dun-anything?
Dumfries?
Dumfries?
That sort of works around that edge.
"Yes, it does, you're right."
Let's go for that.
Enter.
Cum...?
Cumbernauld?
Cumber...
"Yes, that goes all the way around there."
There's Ayr.
"No, hang on, Cumber..."
"Oh, that way, oh yes!"
"So, around there."
Cumber...
And then...
"What are you doin', what are you doin'?"
I'm lookin' for some friends of yours.
One of them's a little guy.
"Wears a beret, has a beard."
"The other one's a big, stocky guy."
"Ugly, looks like an animal..."
You know who I'm talking about?
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
- No?
"- No, uh-uh."
Huh... huh?
"Early this morning, a friend of mine got mugged."
I think they did it.
"A black man, this morning?"
You know anything about that?
"No, I don't know anything about it."
"Wait, no, wait... no, no!"
Uh...
now.
Tell me where they are right now.
"Uh, we got a..."
"We got a clubhouse over on barton and throop, on the... on the second floor, okay?"
That's it.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
No...
"If you're lyin', I'll be back."
"No, I'm not lying to you."
[Panting]
I'm not lyin' to you!
[Music playing]
[Group chatter]
But that didn't mean she had to like him.
Franko!
As I live and breathe.
(CHUCKLES)
Franko!
As I live and breathe.
(CHUCKLES)
You don't look a day older.
You don't look a day older.
"I'd give you a big kiss, George,"
"I'd give you a big kiss, George, but these good Richmond folks might get the wrong idea, uh?"
"but these good Richmond folks might get the wrong idea, uh?"
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)
So...
"So... ..how's the gun shop business, uh?"
"..how's the gun shop business, uh?"
Having copper mates never hurts.
Having copper mates never hurts.
A beer?
Or do you want a woggy wine?
Give me a beer.
A beer?
Or do you want a woggy wine?
Give me a beer.
Sure.
Sure.
"What can I do for you, Franko?"
"What can I do for you, Franko?"
You heard I'm looking for someone?
You heard I'm looking for someone?
Thought you might know the right man.
- I don't know.
It's OK.
I've got my badges.
- Why?
"- Look, all I know is that... that there was a girl, some stripper who worked in Soho."
"Freddie Lau stole her from Grey, and Grey went mental."
- Kayleigh Fenchurch?
"- Stop the machine, I'm dying here!"
Come on.
"One last push, JC."
Huh?
"He was wearing a barman's outfit when he came in, wasn't he?"
Try the King's Oak in Chinatown.
Cough fit.
It's all the rage in LA.
I need to see Lily-Anne.
"- It's not gonna happen, Grey."
- Why?
"What do you mean, why?"
You're the prime suspect in her father's murder.
I need her help to get me out of it.
Time is running out for me.
Like it was running out for poor Freddie.
Either she helps me get out of here or they're gonna catch me.
And I will not keep my mouth shut.
All right?
- There you are.
"- Thank you, Stan."
Kevin Grey is now working in Kinzoku.
Lily-Anne Lau's karaoke bar.
- Who's that?
- No-one.
- No!
"- I don't need to go to a doctor, no."
"- Meemaw, Meemaw..."
"- No, no, no."
"- Meemaw, I promised..."
"I promised my mom that I would take you to the doctor, okay?"
Okay.
Then I'm gonna drive.
"You're not gonna drive, Meemaw."
- I'm gonna drive.
- No.
Too many DUls.
"Hey, scoot over, four eyes."
- Oh...
"- Come on, come on."
"- Martha, just..."
- But you're not...
You're not on my insurance policy.
"Oh, we won't tell anybody."
"Well, legally, I have to call the police if you drive."
"Legal, schmegal."
"Move over, honey."
Wow.
Ten years I haven't driven.
"Chip, what's new?"
What's happening at the Arby's?
"Uh, I don't work there anymore."
I'm a professional clown.
Oh.
"So, that means you're the breadwinner, Martha, darling?"
What do you mean?
"A man shouldn't rely on his wife for money, Chip."
(woman laughing)
- Great tush?
Mike:
Great.
- 'Cause you're a fucking fag.
"- No, I'm not a fag, I just appreciate a great tush when I see one."
"- No offense, Mike, but you are a fag."
- You're a fag.
"- No-- I am not a fag, you're not a fag."
"- Hey, Iâm not-- I'm not a fag."
"- Oh, yeah?"
Prove it.
"- All right, all right, all right."
"All right, he said it 'cause--"
- What?
- He said it 'cause you said it.
He said it 'cause you said it.
- But I'm not a fag.
"- Yeah, no, we know you're not a fag."
"Right, you said it, 'cause you retaliated."
"- Yeah, I said it 'cause you said I was--"
- Right?
- Yes.
"- All right, it's okay, Pete."
- Watch your mouth.
- It's okay.
- You watch my mouth.
- What?
- Nothing.
"- Okay, okay."
"All right, Mike."
"Mike, let me get-- Let me buy you a beer."
It seems there was an argument.
She fell down the stairs.
Potentially a blow to the head before she fell.
Potentially?
- l don't have all the facts yet.
- Is she all right?
"No, she's badly hurt."
Her brain.
They already arrested Albert.
I sent Clay and Sadie down there.
I'll have to go down there myself.
I promised Shannon I'd take her to the Father-Daughter Dance at the club tonight.
"I have no idea how long l'll be with Albert, so--"
"Oh, Dad, Dad--"
"Just drive her over there, and I'll catch up."
- Just drive her there?
"- Yeah, right."
Samantha's case is up.
All right.
Where is he?
I don't know.
Well... she's up.
Um... will you be OK here?
His hotel room is just a block away.
I'll be right back.
I'm late.
Your-- Your dad went home.
"So, um... your ne_ hearing is in 28 days."
OK.
And we will get you moved then.
28 days.
That's when we'll move you.
- Do you guys remember?
- He did.
That was uncomfortable.
- Yeah.
On-stage.
"- But I stopped it, didn't I?"
- There we go.
"- Yeah, he was trying to get me back..."
"Oh, my gosh."
"- But, Mike, I averted your..."
"- Yeah, you did."
We were on stage doing a QA in Toronto and Rafi said:
"""Mike, sing that song that you always sang to me on set."""
And he was getting me back because of this prank we had played on him in Toronto.
He was getting you back for the $20 prank?
"Yes, exactly."
"Oh, I felt..."
I was really...
That was not a good moment.
"And he looked at me, like, the most sadistic look."
"Well, and then he got his, like, Rafi little-kid thing of like:"
"""Mike, you did it to me."""
Hilarious.
"And then I played, like, mom."
I was mom there.
"I was like, ""No."
"Michael does not do it."""
"- Yeah, that was nice."
- Here we go.
Bishop Allen.
"Oh, Mike."
"Oh, yeah, here we go."
Stupid?
I was gonna say sophisticated.
"That's no sophisticated, that's British."
Don't be confused.
Right.
What's he doing in Vegas?
Losing a bet.
Huh?
I bet him I could bring in more money than him in the next 24 hours.
Loser leaves Vegas for good.
"Oh, Sam, are you sure that's wise?"
The guy is a legend.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
You know what I mean.
"I'm the number one casino host in Las Vegas, no matter who my competition is."
Right.
"Anyway, I have an ace up my sleeve, so I can't lose."
An ace?
Mm-hmm.
Mr. Wu.
He plays at least a million a visit.
That sounds like an ace.
Mm-hmm.
"Mr. Wu, hi."
Let's get you to a table.
"I don't think so, Sam."
"Uh, is there a problem?"
I'll say.
You have a ghost?
"Oh, the ghost."
[Chuckles]
That's absurd.
I really want to do well at this job.
I can't do well if everybody thinks that I got my job by sleeping with my boss.
"So if you will excuse me, I am meeting with the EM very shortly..."
- EM?
- It's the executive matchmaker.
Now silence.
Mother.
You want help with that bar?
There you go.
- Hey.
"- Oh, hey!"
You made it.
Yeah.
"I didn't want Major Pain to make me do extra pushups, so I ran here."
- Wow.
"- Hey, you should check them out."
"Oh, yeah."
That...
Nice.
- I got yours in my bag.
- Great.
You need to break them in.
What are you doing tomorrow?
"- Say, around 11?"
- I...
I work.
I'm...
I'm a lawyer.
That's too bad.
"Not that you're a lawyer, that you're not free."
"Well, you know, I work pretty flexible hours."
Cool.
Every young student doctor...
She wanted to know my menstrual history.
I didn't know what she was talking about till she told me.
I felt like a right bleeding'eejit.
"Why didn't she just say ""your periods""?"
"We'll weigh you now, Sharon."
Doctors are always like that.
"""Menstrual history."""
"I got a ""C"" in that in me inter."
How are your movements?
Not bad.
How's yours?
There's the heartbeat now.
See it?
Yeah.
Only one heart.
What?
There aren't twins in there.
"Oh, yeah."
That there is a leg.
See it?
"Oh, yeah."
Sharon?
Why didn't you come in this morning?
Had a checkup.
I swapped with Mona.
You should be on check...
Ask her.
You should be on check-out now.
I can't do it!
Why not?
'Cause I have to keep going to the toilet!
Feel with your fingertips
I can't reach it.
- Don't kill him!
"- Can't just let him live, can I?"
- Please!
"- Weakness, Luke!"
Weakness!
"Gem... come on, you can do it."
Reach.
Tell you what... three bullets left.
50-50 chance of getting a live round.
If he lives...
I'll let him go.
- You want me to sh-shoot him?
"- Wake up, Luke!"
"I'm giving you the chance to save him, or you can point the gun at me, but you'll only get one chance, and if there's no bullet... well... it's all over for you."
"- Please, please don't shoot me."
Please.
"- It's not up to me, sunshine."
"Decision time, Luke."
Me or the fag?
"Either way, it's 50-50."
Time to pick a side.
Five seconds...
Four...
- No!
- Three...
Two...
- One.
"- Please don't, please, Luke, Luke..."
"- No, Gem, Gem, run, run."
- But what about you and Paul?
is here.
I put r in the conference room.
You did?
I did.
"No,I did."
- His fianc?
"- Yeah,his fianc?"
.
Tall?
Light brown hair?
Redhead.
Someone has made a huge mistake.
James isn't dead.
He's been writing me letters from iraq.
It's a common name.
"The news said he was born in jackson,pennsylvania."
It's a small town.
That james finn has been dead three months.
He left for iraq three nths ago.
I saw him the morning he went away.
And I just got a letter from him last week.
He says he misses me and he's working a lot.
We'll need those.
"Okay,but I want them back."
It's his handwriting.
I recognize it.
They've been coming for months.
Now I want to know who that other woman is.
We're not here to talk about that.
"Is she saying that she's engad to jimmy,too?"
"'Cause if tt's true, he better hope he's dead,or else I'll kill him."
"James and I connecte on a deep,spiritual level."
"Right, let's rest and consolidate."
That's what I want to hear all day.
Call you when I wake up.
Bye.
What are you up to?
Where are you going?
Dinner with Lisa.
What?
I'm a bit hungry too.
I can sleep after dinner.
"You won't go, we're eating at street stalls."
Bullshit!
Who says so?
"I go there often, let's go."
Really?
More beer!
Coming!
"No big deal, I eat this often."
Isn't it better at my home?
Why do this comrade like our HK street stalls?
Cos Lisa likes it.
Why didn't you tell me so?
Why you never ask?
Why do you always talk to me like this?
Bad temper.
Yes...
"I'm bad-tempered, lots of faults."
"But my plus point, likes the famous jockey, Silent Witness,"
I never give up.
Lisa...
Marry me?
He's said it.
Get over agin that wall!
And you're the guy that's been riding me to the nut house!
Stop him!
"Somebody, stop him!"
He's crazy!
Get him away!
Get the warden!
And you're the dirty screw that killed my pal!
[YELLING]
[MEN YELLING]
MEULLER:
That's for all the guys you beat up and put in the Hole!
And that!
And that!
And this is for Lassiter!
[MEN SILENCE]
[MEN MURMURING]
We're crashing out!
Who's coming with us?
[CHEERING]
Come on!
"I don't know what he's wanted for, but I was told to bring him along by Stacey."
"Come on, get going."
[MEN YELLING]
"Come on, Ross."
We need ya.
"You're all crazy, men."
Don't try it!
They'll blast you before you get to the gate!
Don't be suckers.
Stay out of it!
"If I didn't know you were stir-nuts, I'd blast ya!"
Was that a person?
Wife
The rat fell into the trap.
"You all right, baby?"
You Okay?
I'm okay.
Come here.
You're okay now?
You're okay now?
Drink up.
Good girl.
Leaveit
I want to tidy up a little.
Leave it.
We've got the shaman to thank for everything.
Get some rest.
You must be exhausted.
Shaman
Damn fool.
Suspect arrested in the mushroom-tonic case...
Victims have developed severe mental derangement...
Mr. Yang E-sam?
Yes.
The landlady was a victim.
"Your uncle must've taken the tonic, too."
It's turned the town upside down.
We've gotta bring him in.
You should get a lawyer.
"After all, he's a victim, too."
What the fuck?
What are you doing here?
Get out.
- How on earth did you find me?
Your beloved boss.
"Fuck you, Cavit!"
Can?
"It's OKauntie, he's a friend..."
"C'mon girl, I need to go shopping!"
I've nothing left to wear.
Nothing?
As if you ever had anything...
I can buy your entire day.
"It's my photo shoot day, with that German."
Why don't you meet him later?
Then you'll get paid twice!
What's going on?
I can't go out during daylight.
Do I need to talk to yourmom?
Fuck you.
My ass is freezing'...
Swimming in November?
!
No whole wheat?
I called yourmom when you left your phone at the bar...
Why is that?
She was one mean woman.
You idiot!
What did you say?
Don't shout!
"All I said was ""Ahmet"", and she was already yelling..."
Sorry...
My mom is a little bit weird.
I'm not in the mood anymore.
Hellooo!
That was a long-ass leg.
Ain't know where the hell I was going with that.
"That's just a long-ass, Wendy Williams-sized leg."
Damn!
It was big--
You ain't been here the whole show?
"You talking about some, ""Damn."""
I've said some fucked-up shit.
"My God, man."
Jump on it.
That shit remind me of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air... when Will Smith and Carlton got in that--all right.
I love Fresh Prince.
That's my show.
"But y'all, I'll be honest with you."
Will Smith does not think I sound like him.
Nope.
"First time I met him, it was weird."
He was like...
"""Yo, Jay, I don't think you can sound like me."""
And I was like...
"""Yo, Will, stop playing."""
"He was like, ""Yeah, that's good."
"""Check it out."
Whoo!
"Miami."""
"He made some good music, man, you know?"
"No, but I was raised mostly on, like,"
Biggie Smalls and Tupac.
That's what I like listening to.
Biggie Smalls is just cool.
Just cool.
¶ First of all I Poppa.
Boss.
- What's her name?
The one in green.
- Macarena.
Give her this and another round.
- It's strange.
- What is?
"He's good-looking, he could have any girl."
Why does he do it?
You look tired.
You should go to bed.
"Take the car, I don't mind."
I'll walk back.
Wednesday morning 200 workers with pickets blocked the national highway at four different spots...
- Evening.
- Evening.
I'm coming!
I'm alone.
- Can I come in'?
"- Yeah, sure."
Just a moment.
What can you tell me about this?
- That she has nice tits.
"- It's Carmen, she's dead."
She had nice tits.
- What can I tell you?
- Whatever you know.
- Where did you get it?
- That's not your concern.
- I'm a journalist.
- Don't make me laugh.
- Send it to Madrid.
So you better leave at once!
Down there!
Surround them!
Don't move!
"Daddy, I got the Formula!"
You think my daughter would help you?
Fools!
You'll die in a woman's hands some day.
You didn't kiss me.
"Yoyo, you've tricked me all along."
"Daddy, I want him dead!"
See!
I told you!
Your bad breath gave it away.
"Supermac 1, Yoyo, Robin."
You're done.
Say your prayers!
Ready...!
"Have no fear, there are women about."
More women?
Ha!
There are only men here.
Where are the women?
Sisters!
It's time to get rid of the traitor.
"And prove your loyalty to the country, show yourselves!"
Have you forgotten I'm woman too?
What?
She's a woman?
And I'm 100 percent woman!
"You're really dumb, I'm in front of you for so long."
And you still don't know I am woman!
(STOMACH GURGLING)
Just hold that thought and stay right there.
Oh-oh.
(MANSLEY SIGHS)
DEAN:
Little lower.
Little bit lower...
Hey.
I thought you were in trouble.
DEAN:
That sucks.
Let me just...
Up a little.
I had to ditch this weird guy who's staying at our house.
It took me hours to shake him!
I kill myself to get out here!
And you have him doing...
Arts and crafts!
"You got a problem with arts and crafts, little man?"
"He's a giant robot, Dean."
It's a little undignified.
Yeah?
"Well, smart guy, what would you have him do?"
(MAKES ENGINE SOUNDS) Main systems on.
Main engines.
"One, two and three."
All systems go.
"Five, four, three two, one!"
Blast off!
(SCREAMING)
We're landing.
We're landing!
-Don't.
How's the court?
We're digging our own graves here.
"Keep it, Superman."
"Coffee, please."
It's on the house.
-Thanks.
Where's Hakkarainen?
-I told him to get a job.
Said that to the King!
He'd rather kill himself than get a job.
-Let's drink to that!
Hakkarainen is going to jump from the crane!
Buy me a beer when you get down!
What's this?
You're off-duty.
I know him from way back.
Who am I to stop anyone?
"You want to exercise, fine."
Hakkarainen!
"Show us a somersault, faggot!"
You're a mountain lion!
You'll always land on your feet!
A career leap!
Where did the tomato go?
Show us a fucking triple lutz!
Get back or I'll jump!
-No you won't.
"Don't you know your old friends anymore, King?"
Garbage Jesse!
Dammit...
It's been a while.
"I'm gonna set your nephew straight, get him singing like a canary... all's right with the world."
"$10,000."
"10,000."
Cash to you.
I'm not saying to throw the case.
Just... no talking to the DEA.
Are you saying what I think you're saying?
Yes.
What's it going to be?
What?
That dude wouldn't take a bribe?
That dude in there?
Saul Goodman we're talking about?
"""Morally outraged"", he said."
Threatened to call the police.
And Badger's gonna spill?
Like the Exxon Valdez.
So what do we do about it?
"Francesca, how about I follow you home?"
- No!
- For safety!
What?
"God, you are killing me with that booty."
"Talk to me, guys!"
Come on.
Just tell me what you want!
Jesus!
"No, no, no."
No.
It wasn't me!
It was Ignacio!
He's the one!
I haven't been a very good parent.
I know that.
I fucked up.
But I've always loved you.
"You're my baby, man."
Hello?
Yeah.
May I say who's calling?
"You've got a lovely accent, Sara."
Very compelling.
Where are you from?
What a coincidence.
I'm eating a bagel right now.
Hang on.
It's Sara from Israel for you.
-Hey.
-Hi.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'm just taking a mental health day."
How is your mental health?
Haven't quite gotten to mine yet.
I'm still dealing with everyone else's.
"It's not true, that thing you said last night."
What thing I said last night?
The thing about my heart.
It's not true at all.
I can't control my heart.
I mean I wouldn't want to even if I could.
-Sara?
-Yeah.
Can I call you right back?
Then her shoes disappear in the light of the lamp.
"It blinds me, so I close my eyes"
and her face is gone.
Thanks for the flowers.
Did you bring me some licorice?
I forgot.
"Daddy, I'm sorry."
Get up and do your exercises.
Yes.
The mice have a picnic on a mountain.
"They lay down a tablecloth, a tray."
Can I have some?
- No.
"It's not for you, it's for the mice."
"Everyone gets some cake, except for the baby, because it's too hard for her."
She only drinks.
Gonki.
"My Gonki, my Gonki."
"It went by fast, huh?"
What am I talking about?
It's over.
I have to put it behind me.
"It's easy for us to say, but for you?"
It's over.
Where's Ora?
Having some tests done.
She couldn't cancel them.
She didn't tell me about any tests.
She said the swelling went down a few weeks ago.
Hello.
"Hello, Daddy."
- Hello.
I need legal help.
We have a suspect who's refusing a cheek swab.
I'll file for a dna search warrant.
What's the name?
Rebecca kemp.
I'll e-mail you the info.
Listen... yomiss working with us?
I think the legal department is more my speed.
"Why,do you miss me?"
"Uh,sure."
Boss... agent lee is getting us our cheek swab.
Rebecca paranoid or guilty?
Might just be angry.
"At finn,us,t world."
"Go back with her to h apartment,get finn's stuff."
"And,no,I don'want to wait for a search warrant."
I'll grab my coat.
Wait at the elevator.
Okay.
"Hey,you."
Where's my money?
"Yeah,you."
Did you and jimmy spend it?
Please get away from me.
I don't know you.
I am jimmy's fiancee.
James loved me.
- He used you.
- You liar!
Chick fight!
He loved me!
get off of me!
- A week?
- Sorry?
A week?
"Yes, that's right."
It strangely matches.
What does?
Cute.
What breed is your dog?
"You see, her appetite for dogs..."
"I mean, her attachment to dogs is strong."
She hates it when others get near her food.
He's a half-breed.
We're raising him for the summer.
I'll be going now.
Do you mime as well?
I'm sure the murderer is one of them.
- Wait!
Wait please!
- You foolish kid!
Please stop!
You can't kill me now.
Why not?
That detective.
He's suspicious of you all.
Suspicious?
He's noticed that you all are foxes.
What?
How do you know that?
By what evidence?
"Yeah, he's lying."
I'm not lying.
Please listen to me.
Why would you be doing that?
You got a really good face.
Bullshit.
Don't give me that.
"No, no, really."
You got some great character--
Who are you doing this for?
Seriously.
"Just for practice, just for the heck of it."
This is what I do.
"I sit here all day, and I draw--"
- You've been here all day?
- ...people as they come by.
"All day, yeah."
"And you draw other people, too."
"- Yeah, plenty of them."
- Let me see.
I can't because actually I gave them the pictures.
Would you like your picture?
- You'll give it to me?
- Absolutely.
Here we go.
All yours.
Enjoy.
Okay.
"Sorry about that, man."
You just never know.
- You know what I mean?
- It's not a problem.
- Enjoy it.
"- Okay, buddy."
I haven't stuttered once in over six weeks.
- Skip the captain.
Where is he?
"He's been holed up at my place, until two days ago. I ain't seen him since."
- Who else has he seen here?
"- No one, that is, ex cept her."
The Chandler doll?
What's she like?
She's tops.
"With him, with everyone."
- When did he last see her?
- l don't know that.
"Just bef ore he left my place, he gave me a letter f or you."
What are you waiting f or?
Give it to me.
- Come on.
Where is it?
- Here.
- Hand it over.
Give it to me.
- Go on and give it to him.
Not here.
Tomorrow morning at your hotel.
"- l have that table f or you, f riend."
- l didn't want a table.
"Sorry, sir."
My mistake.
There was something about him I didn't like.
"Maybe his calling me ""friend."""
"Evening, Mrs. Chandler."
A Ramos gin fizz?
Nobody can make them the way you can.
Thank you very much.
You're doing your other voice.
"Yes, love, did you notice?"
"Naughty, naughty children!"
RUN!
What do we do?
"Frannie, Frannie, imagine her melting."
What?
!
"In your head, melt her."
I can't!
I'm getting impatient!
You have been VERY naughty!
What about the man?
"You said the man was here, the cloud man."
"Well, he's not, is he?"
Where's the Doctor?
I don't know!
Doctor?
Doctor who?
That's the way to do it!
"Oi, Ow!"
Where did she go?
Will she come back?
"No, don't worry."
She's currently draining through your carpet.
"New setting, anti-freeze, and you're very welcome, by the way."
I'm very grateful.
I knew you'd come.
"No, you didn't, because I don't."
Because this isn't the sort of thing
I do any more.
"Next time you're in trouble, don't expect me to..."
Yours?
I won it.
You won it?
On the horse Mr. Fawlty got a tip on.
"I hope you don't mind, I..."
"No, no, not at all."
"I didn't know you bet on the horses, Polly."
"Oh, I don't."
"Only I was in the town, and I passed the betting shop, and I thought, well, why not?"
"Well, why not indeed?"
"Jolly good question, eh, dear?"
"Pity you didn't let me put something on, really."
You realize how much we would've won?
£75 for a £5 stake.
"Still, you know best."
"Those were the odds, were they, Basil?"
"Yes, that's right, dear."
14-1.
I listened in on the wireless just to make sure it had triumphed.
"Enjoy your winnings, Polly."
Thank you.
Polly.
"Yes, Mrs. Fawlty?"
What was the name of the horse?
The name?
Uh...
I've gone blank.
Birdbrain!
Birdbrain?
"No, no, that came in third."
Uh...
Fishwife!
Out!
- What?
"- Fuck, man."
I can't hang out with you.
Why?
"Because of what you did, Chip!"
You sold out the whole population.
"- Aw, Cooler, come on, man."
"Not you, too?"
- No!
- Of all people.
"- Dude, no."
"Your actions, Chip, they have causes, dude."
"And those causes, there's an effect."
It's about causes and actions.

Good evening.
"Oh, lovely."
"Oh... you are looking more beautiful than ever, mademoiselle."
"Oh, monsieur."
How many men have told you you were beautiful?
"Oh, many, very many, but i pay no attention to them."
Did one ever tell you you were ugly?
No.
You're ugly.
What?
I dealt you a wrong card.
I'm not jim fisk jr.
I'm nick boyd.
I'm his partner.
I think i hate you!
Mmm.
Have you run down yet?
Down to the deuce.

It's an end-around.
GEORGE:
"No, no, it's not."
He's still got it.
He's still got it.
STEVEN:
Shit.
- Who let that happen?
It's embarrassing.
GEORGE:
Argh!
DEVON:
That is so embarrassing.
What?
Did any of you guys have a chance to get to the store?
"Oh, yeah, no."
"We're good, we got takeout."
"No, I didn't mean for you, I meant f..."
GEORGE:
"All right, here we go."
"- Come on, defense, wake up."
You have to be kidding me.
I just got a little bit more of this I gotta finish.
There's some laundry I'm gonna put away then I had another load of clothes in the dryer.
"I did get some of the food your dad likes, but some healthy stuff too."
"Just, you know."
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be okay.
[CAR ALARM CHIRPS]
[HAMMERING]
Bend your knee a little bit more.
What is it?
The Ark.
If it is there at Tanis...
Then it is something men was not meant to disturb.
Death has always surrounded it.
It is not of this earth.
Do we need the monkey?
"I'm surprised at you Jones, Talking that way about our baby."
He's got your looks too.
And your brain...
"I noticed it, she's a smart little thing, smart!"
Hey!
where are you going?
"She'll be all right, have a date."
"Come on, come on..."
Marion!
What's this?
It's a Date.
You eat 'em.
Sieg Heil!
Ja.
Sieg Heil.
Ist Nae.
"Ja, ja."
"How come you haven't found some nice girl to settle down with, raise eight or nine kids like your friend Sallah?"
Who says I haven't?
"Ha, ha!"
I do.
Dad had you figured a long time ago.
He said you were a bum.
"Oh, he's being generous."
The most gifted bum he ever trained.
"- No, ma'am, i'm not here to take anything."
I'm here to bring something back.
Just sign right here and i'll bring it in.
I don't have any money.
I didn't order anything.
You of all people should know that.
"Ma'am, it's already been taken care of."
Just sign and i'll bring the stuff in.
"It's got my name and address on it, baby."
"Well, bring it on."
"All right, fellas, move it in."
Come on.
- What?
- What is this?
"Oh, it's your furniture."
Oh my goodness.
How did this happen?
- Who did...
"Mama, thank you."
"- Oh, i didn't do it,"
But i'll take the hug.
I need one about now.
"Mama, this is all our furn..."
"Marcus, you did this."
"Baby, thank you."
"Sorry, babe, i wish i could take the credit,"
But i didn't have anything to do with it.
"Well, then who did this?"
How did this happen?
"It was me, mama."
- Monica?
- You?
At least you had an idea.
I didn't know which goddamn way
To go.
Yeah.
"You know, Lou, you know when"
"I get stuck like that, there's"
Only two people who's lead I'd
Follow in a heartbeat.
That's you and Tommy.
"You've saved my ass, goddamn I"
Don't even know how many times.
So tonight you didn't.
Yeah.
"That's all you gotta say,"
Is yeah?
Uh-Huh?
"No sweat, man."
"Hey, buddy."
Where's the mustard?
Thanks very much.
"You know something, pal?"
"You got to lose, like, 75 pounds."
"Seriously, bro."
If I got to pull you out of a

Going.
Juice.
"Hey, lady."
"Wow, that's a really ugly baby."
"I mean, I'm sure she's gonna"
Grow up to be a very gorgeous
"Person one day, but there's no"
"No, they ran out, so they used 2 percent."
"- Oh, my God!"
- Okay.
Come on!
"Oh, my God!"
"Come on, baby."
Do it.
Do what you have to.
Okay.
"Here, sweetie."
My God!
How dare you?
"I specifically asked for skimmed... and you bring me this fatty, moogeous cow loyd?"
"I'm sorry, I'm so, so sorry, it's just you're so thin!"
Don't patronize me!
Get this out of here.
Clean it up now.
Did you get my husband on the phone?
The hotel said he checked out.
Can't you do anything right?
Call again!
- I tried three times.
- Did you ask for the right name?
It's.
"De la Paix, I'm sure you got it wrong."
De La Paix It's not that hard.
I'm certain that I said it right.
The hotel specifically said that Mr. And Mrs. De la Paix... checked out.
"Jocelyn, I'm so terribly sorry for the way I behaved."
I'm off to London for a week.
It's my father's birthday.
I'll see you at the Return Bash.
Yeah.
"And when you're 15,"
I'll teach you how to roll your own.
"Wink, wink."
"Cleveland, you've worked enough to go on the cruise."
(goofy grunting)
Now it's time to put those pills away and get some rest.
Nuh-uh!
There's still days before this cruise.
"I can keep working and have weeks, maybe even months off!"
Months!
Do you know how long a month is?
"I'm asking you a question, Donna!"
"Ah, forget it!"
The pills will tell me.
(crazy laughter)
That man's a mess.
"Howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy!"
Let's see.
Hmm.
How many Mega Energy Pills can I get for... this?
(grunts)
"This says: ""Happy birthday, Rallo, from Grandma."""
(grunts)
"And this is a Post-it note that says: ""One hundred dollars."""
Is it hot?
It's hot in here.
Are you hot?
I'm hot.
"Guy back there taking a long time with them pills, huh?"
!
"Sorry, sir."
"Driving back, he saw you driving in front of him with Byron in the car."
Where had you and Byron been at 4:00 a.m.?
We've been here all night.
June's mixed up.
He's old.
He don't see so well.
-I'll make the bastard talk!
-He won't talk.
It's his sister.
Can I speak to the boy?
-How are you this morning?
-Fine.
-Pretty sleepy?
-I guess so.
-You go out with Uncle Ronnie last night?
-No.
You sure?
-You didn't see a pretty lady?
-No.
You sure?
-Did Uncle Ronnie tell you to say that?
-Yeah.
So this has just been pretend?
What do you say we stop playing pretend and play really?
And you really should spend a night in jail.
So you can tell your sister.
You got to let me go.
"I can't do that, Lila."
You can't let them put me in jail.
What's going to happen to our baby with me in jail?
Your mom will keep taking care of him.
I'll give her money for him.
Hallelujah.
Auf Wiedersehen.
I'll see you around.
- You okay?
- Sure.
Is this what you really want?
Do I have a choice?
Molly?
"Molly, do you know where you are?"
You're in the hospital.
You were hit by a car.
We're taking very good care of you.
You like my ring?
"I know you're scared, but I'll stay with you."
We called your parents.
They'll be here very soon.
"Okay, let's extubate her."
Carter....
- What's her tidal volume?
-500 ccs.
Gases are good.
All right.
Excellent.
- We're gonna take this tube out.
- Squeeze my hand.
Make sure the cuff is down before you extubate her.
Good.
"Now, what I want you to do is pretend you're blowing out your birthday candles."
Take another big breath.
"When I say go, blow out real hard, okay?"
Go.
- Nice.
"Rose, I'm his only chance."
Let's go.
- You workin' with the feds?
- No.
- IA?
- No.
You're alone.
Let's go.
"- Oh, shit."
- All right.
Get down.
Get down.
"- Oh, shit."
- And stay down.
Shit.
"Bill, where are you?"
"Bill, if you read, we're going back to the station."
You gonna keep me in here?
You gonna keep me in here with cuffs?
"- You don't know what you're doing, do you?"
- Shut up.
"You don't have a clue as to what the fuck is going on, do you, Sheriff?"
"Bill, do you copy?"
"Bill, do you read?"
"- It's just club soda, Freddy."
- Finish it.
"- Hey, Ray."
"- Hey, Freddy."
I came to tell you I found Superboy... and I'm bringing him in tomorrow morning... and I'd like you to come with me.
I owe you that much.
"He's a fugitive, Ray, and he's convinced you're tryin' to kill him."
"Just tell me where he is, Freddy."
"Oh, yes..."
I am.
"- Hey, douche bag, get out of there!"
- What does this mean?
"- Come on, fuckface!"
"- Alright, pig... get out here!"
Come on!
"- Come on, come on!"
- Get out here.
"Don't hurt me, I'm just a poor college student!"
"Poor, poor?"
Then we'll find someone who'll pay for you.
"No, not my mother!"
"Please, not my mother."
"- Guys, what should we do?"
- Let's knock him off!
"No, no."
Please!
I'll give you everything I have!
- Like what?
"- Everything, everything."
Candies?
"No, I don't like breath mints."
This linen handkerchief.
My mother gave it to me for my birthday.
- It's not worth anything.
- Come on.
Come on!
I have 16.600 liras to last me to the end of the month.
- I'll take that.
- What about me?
You get nothing!
You made it.
"How about that, kiddo?"
Excuse me.
Are you the parents of the little boy in the tunnel?
How does it feel to know that Mercy was three minutes--?
Excuse me.
I think you'd better leave.
"Sorry, I'm talking with these people."
"No, you're not."
"Hey, how are you feeling?"
- You made it.
- Just like you promised.
- Thank you.
- It's all right.
You remember Wrigley Field.
We got a date.
Sit down.
Let me finish.
- That one was crooked.
- Yeah?
Next time you can do it yourself.
"- Hey, Mark, thanks."
- For what?
You did all the hard work.
I don't think I could've gone up in that helicopter.
I just got lucky.
No.
You know about kids.
As good as new.
- Where are you going?
- Check for reporters.
All clear.
Uh...
"Thanks, big man."
It really looks beautiful.
I'm sorry about earlier.
Please don't smoke in the house.
Roman.
You want one?
No.
You know I promised Ryan.
What's that?
Paper?
It's cute.
# No I can't save you
# You're on your own
# You're on your own
#NoIjustcan'thelp...
Things get too busy on the couch to call?
I was doing something for my brother.
Oh yeah?
Am I gonna meet this brother of yours?
It's not likely.

My Mom would have loved you.
"Well, of course."
You said she had good taste.
"You know, you can't ever leave me."
No matter how bad a wife I am.
You're a perfect wife.
Liar.
- I just got a daughter.
- Congratulations.
- Do you have a wife?
- No.
- You haven't married?
- No.
A girlfriend?
No.
- Is it rude of me to ask?
"- No, no."
- Why don't I get that wine?
- Good idea.
"When I went home, I thought you would follow me."
I thought so too.
I thought you would come back.
You did?
But we didn't.
We should go to India.
- Why?
- It's warm.
They've got good hotels.
Stop it.
Why?
Look at this apartment.
We're lying on a mattress.
There's lots to do.
- It doesn't matter.
- It does.
- And we're going to Val d'lsere.
"- We can go there, but not India?"
Give me a break.
"Ever since you met your real, holy father   you've been really irritating to be with."
"Look, you got to trust me, okay?"
Everything's going to be just fine.
"Hi, there."
I'm Judy.
Who are you?
Becca.
You're the lady on TV.
"Stay here, Becca."
We'll be right back.
I brought your phone back.
You haven't played the message on TV yet.
I will.
I made a copy.
"Mrs. Jerome, I have to ask you one more time."
Where did your daughter go when she disappeared 12 years ago?
I already told you.
I don't know.
This may be important.
I'll tell you what's important.
Everyone believes Jeffrey's a victim in this.
I need them to hear my daughter.
"Look, I've called the hotline, like, five times."
Why the hell hasn't anyone called me back?
!
You know what?
Forget it.
Don't bother.
"Hey, you seen Nicky?"
She'll show up.
Don't worry.
"Come on, Peter, we gotta go."
Are you in or are you out?
Wait.
Hold up.
Coach.
"Sorry, I was in the shower."
No problem.
I'll let you out over there.
"Hey, thanks for working with me today."
"Oh, you're welcome."
You're just getting started.
"I feel like I'm not normally that bad, though."
- It's those fucking nerves.
- Everybody gets them.
Is there anything to do around here?
- Do?
Like what?
- I don't know.
Go grab a drink or something.
I don't feel like staying home.
You want to grab a drink with me?
We could do that.
We could do that.
Let's not.
You're a talented fighter.
You have my attention.
"- No, I didn't mean that."
"- Oh, I know."
See you tomorrow.
Good work.
[Both moaning]
"Oh, my gosh."
That was so good.
You are fucking insane.
Hello?
Yes I'm fine.
Normal.
Hear about what?
Of course I've read the newspapers.
"Yes, I'll wait."
Luisa.
I prefer to meet Laura by myself.
As you want.
Yes.
Yesterday.
Almost at eight.
Sometimes I heard him saying at dusk time.
When I walked in the terrace door was opened.
"When I saw it, I knew what happened."
Soon people screamed.
Windows opened.
Everybody showed up.
They said someone fell out.
As I was going up in the elevator he was falling down.
Did he try it before?
Never.
I was scared of him doing it before.
But he was fine now.
You know they had to confine him.
He told me the day we met.
He was very good now.
But I have an idea that comes to my mind.
Julian wanted to win.
To win?
Why don't we leave?
I'm afraid of people coming here.
"Eddie, don't..."
Can you...
I got to go.
"[click, dial tone]"
Fuck.
Fuck.
[spit] [flush]
"You were in there a while, Eddie."
I was just...
I don't know how many times I got to tell you guys.
"If it's a big one, take it upstairs."
"Christ, did you even spray?"
- No.
There was...
- Look at you.
You look like shit.
- Yeah.
- What's going on?
- I feel...
"- What is it, first night back jitters or something?"
- Maybe.
Maybe.
- All right.
"Well, just relax, okay?"
This is probably inevitable.
"Look, I'm gonna put Tate on the big table."
You can deal razz to those English pricks.
- No.
No.
- I'm gonna ease you back in.
"Yeah, that's what we're going to do."
- You sure?
Please don't make a scene.
Where's the restroom?
"Yes, I called him."
When?
Why?
Because.
Want something to eat?
The cafeteria's closed.
He's sleeping.
"It went well, but took a long time."
"We will wake him up soon, to see he's all right."
"Good thing he came in, it was almost too late."
There's a problem with his papers.
- If you don't mind...
- I'll take care of it.
"We almost killed him, and for what?"
My battery's run out.
I need to make a call.
I need to talk to Raziya.
This whole costume is for her sake.
All because I love her.
What's the sense in hiding all this from her?
You know what she calls Him?
Daddy.
"She calls God ""Daddy"" and me she calls ""Honey""."
Do you need help?
No.
What's your name?
Dorona.
- And your brothers?
"- Natanel, and the little one is Shai."
- There's another one.
"I picked-up names,"
"Fill Dill, Cill, Guill, Dill, Hill, Trill ..."
Okay.
I've got it.
And will one-up Will.
-Good for you.
We could get our own school.
We are males.
-We adopts.
"-Takes you, I fit."
I have much to do.
"Okay, then can go, go quench your thirst for blood."
The many other Krills at sea.
Many would appreciate Krills have me as a partner.
I'm a hell of a partner.
You're the only school I have.
"You know that, but no intimacy."
-Are you hurt?
"No, I'm fine."
-I'm fine.
"-What is Seymour, gimme a break."
"No, no, Thank you, brother."
My kids are out there.
"Then, no!"
"Erik and Atticus, to hide."
Let's hide here.
"Rolls, rolls, rolls, where I can fly!"
"Look, My favorite penguins trapped a wall of ice."
Let's do a rotation.
-Forever.
Never seen so many seagulls in one place.
"Stay together, do not differ."
"It's the Sunland Arms, apartment 12B."
You'd better hurry.
There's no time to lose.
Her scalp must be in very bad shape.
It is.
(DOORBELL BUZZING)
"(IN FRENCH ACCENT) Oh, uh, hello, I am Wilbert."
Your husband sent me here to make the scalp happy.
"Oh, come in."
It is not easy to come through this little hole.
"Oh, I'm sorry to have kept you out there in that cold hall, honey."
"But, you know, a nice girl can't be too careful."
(COUGHS)
Why don't you take your coat off?
"Oh, no, this is fine, thank you."
"All right, here is the coat."
(COUGHS)
I must find the place to plug in the equipment.
Over there.
"Oh, merci."
(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)
(WHIRRING)
"Well, I am now ready to begin."
So am I.
You know something?
What?
You're cute.
Do you know something?
Whisper it in my ear.
The scalp is dry.
Come with me.
Where?
–Damn it!
Open the door!
–Just let go of me!
"Well, maybe I should just let my dick do the talking."
"How about that, huh?"
–Huh?
–Open the goddamn door!
"–Shane, come on!"
–Where is he?
Where is he?
He told me to meet him at the stash house.
–Where?
–Open up!
Come on!
Near the bridge.
"You have no idea what you just missed, darlin'."
–Come on!
–Asshole!
"Couldn't split town before you picked up the merchandise, huh?"
"You were always such an idiot, Fleetwood."
Weren't you?
–You can't arrest me.
"–I'm not here to arrest you, asshole."
–Drop it!
Put that on the ground!
"–You heard him, asshole!"
Now!
Turn around!
Turn around!
"Your girlfriend gave you up, man."
She couldn't resist my charms.
–You found something?
- I wrote it.
- What?
In these couple of days?
"Yeah, I think it's pretty good."
These two pages.
How'd you finish so quickly?
Amazing.
Do you like it?
"Don't know, maybe tomorrow it'll look like shit to me."
But it all came within a few hours.
"Funny, huh?"
"It came out so easy, as if I were possessed."
"Yes, Director Kim."
How are you?
I'm home.
Are you still there?
How's your leg?
It still hurts.
I think I was afraid again.
I miss you.
"I'm sorry, too."
Honestly.
When are you coming back?
I think I liked you a lot as a movie director.
And I think you'll have a hard time because of me.
Please stop.
You think so?
Should I try to find someone here who resembles you?
Like you did?
"Yeah, why don't you."
Don't worry.
I won't.
"Hey, man, I don't want to put any kind of pressure on you, but..."
I bet every dime I got on you.
You what?
I guess I got carried away.
No pressure?
You call that no pressure?
Trainer coming through.
Excuse me.
Just take it easy.
Come on.
All right.
Has anyone given him a salt tablet?
No.
Okay.
"I've got your glucose, your dry socks, liniment, bandages."
Bandages?
Bandages?
"- Just relax, okay?"
Relax.
"- Come on, Magnum."
Warm up.
Warm up.
"Yeah, get them legs goin'."
- Get them legs in shape.
"- Two minutes, swimmers."
Two minutes.
"- Oh, no."
- Don't use them too much on the swim...
What?
What do you think you're doing.
I'm sorry.
No one informed me of the dress code.
-Yeah.
-Completely?
-Completely.
That gets me off.
You're easy.
No.
With you I am.
So do I get to...?
Do I get to work on you for a while or do we just fall asleep?
You can work on me all night long.
"I mean, you're with someone."
Why would I let myself fall in love with you?
"What, like I'm just an object to you?"
"I'm just, like, a piece of ass?"
-You just looking to get laid?
-Yeah.
Right.
"-God, you're like a girl."
"-Oh, thanks."
That's really flattering.
"Yeah, it is."
Maybe that's why I like you.
Are you having a sexuality crisis?
No.
I'm not having any kind of crisis.
"You're lucky, you know that?"
No.
I don't know that.
Why am I lucky?
You can control your heart.
"-Hey, thanks for coming out, Darla."
-Good night.
And he's one of your best friends.
Mm-hmm.
Why don't you pursue him?
I always liked him.
I'm just not good at pursuing a guy.
"HALLIE, I'm sorry if I made you feel..."
jealous.
"I mean, I never, never meant to."
I never even knew I did.
"I guess I just feel the way you felt with J.P., you know?"
Yeah.
I understand that.
The next morning as soon as she woke up
Jill took a cab straight home to face the music.
Not knowing if that music...
would be a wedding march.
Drew.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I love you.
I really do love you.
"Me, too."
Smell my hair.
Does it still smell like cigarettes?
No.
It smells like Jill.
Ugh.
Wow.
Look at this.
"Party at our place, and it's only 9am."
"Last night, she was wearing the ugliest pair of cotton granny panties"
I've ever seen in my entire life.
It's not your fault.
"Still, sorry."
"C'mon, Kim, you gotta pull it tight."
"You forgot this, too."
Where's the candy?
Candy?
Didn't bring one?
"We call condoms ""candies"" here."
Mom.
Mom.
Can you hear me?
What're you doing?
I'm back.
Hey.
I'll go to the immigration office the day after tomorrow.
"Don't worry, they won't detain me for overstaying."
It's not like I entered with a fake passport...
Thank you for calling Juicy Fruits.
"Yes, any girl in particular?"
Ilia?
"Sure, for how long?"
"One hour, got it."
"Yes, no problem."
- Ilia.
- Yes?
You have a booking.
Okay.
"Mom, I'll call you again when I'm about to depart."
"Yes, sorry about that."
I'll get more days off so I can train at the gym.
"Yes, thank you."
"Ilia, it's your last day?"
They did an in-service.
I got it.
"'Kay, let's take a look."
Sats down to 92.
- Turn on the suction.
- It's on.
"- No, it's not."
- I have it on high.
I'm not getting anything here.
"Inez, go next door and help Dr. Lockhart with the chest tube."
I'm not allowed to work with any of the nurses now?
The patient is paralyzed.
I can't see the cords.
- I need suction.
- Hold your horses.
Suction container wasn't sealed properly.
You're welcome.
Tube.
Found it.
Two units on the infuser.
Set up for a subclavian.
"Okay, bag him."
- End tidal CO2 is yellow.
- Yellow's good.
I'll be right back.
"All right, hook me up."
O-silk is next?
- O-silk.
Come on.
- Here you go.
And I want to auto-transfuse this guy.
You need a side collector on the thoraseal.
It's too hard on my ego.
"Either way, it felt to get out and get some exercise."
"While you're in the shower, I'll scramble some eggs"
And make some of my special pancakes.
Pancakes for me?
And for me.
Something to restore that energy we've burned out.
JEFF:

My wallet.
I left it at the court.
I hooked it on the chain-link fence.
I'm so stupid.
No problem.
We'll just walk back.
"No, I'll go back."
You stay here with Greta.
It'll be faster.
JEFF:
"OK, Greta."
That's try to stay awake while she's gone.

What are you doing?
- She wants me to buy her flowers.
"- It's not true, Master!"
That's enough...
I'll buy you some then.
"You naughty pair, go!"
It's all your fault!
- Don't behave like that next time!
- It's all your fault!
He asked me to go to the brothel with him.
So you!
Surely you know what kind of man he is by now.
You!
Interesting?
"Mr. Chao, are you satisfied with three girls?"
Not bad... not bad!
"That's fine, enjoy yourself!"
Ah-chuen!
Master!
Reward!
Yes!
"Thanks, sir!"
"Well, let me continue!"
Do you know what's happened to him?
What?
He can't stand it!
Look how happy you are.
"Jun-kit, you should enjoy yourself in this place."
Why are you sitting there like a fool?
"Come on, cheers!"
"Chung-Ian, go and toast to Mr. Hong."
Is that her mother?
I say yes.
And who's that Ghena?
Why does it smell of wine here?
What wine?
We had a drink with Mashka.
Today is her birthday.
We went to a cafe with the girls.
One bottle of champagne for the 5 of us.
"You do remember Mashka, don't you?"
"We came with her last year, remember?"
A little blond one.
- What have you got on your head?
- Grandma's present.
Take it off.
Grandma's present is for winter.
Go to your room.
Get away from the jam with your spoon!
Go to your room!
Lay off me!
"Oh, what great caviar I cooked!"
"Taste it, daughter."
I don't want it now.
"- Taste it now, I said!"
"- Come on, mama..."
Why does Irishka say that I got a big nose?
Is it really big?
That's how they joke now.
I wish you heard what she says to me.
And who is that Ghena?
Ghena is my colleague.
We work together.
"- Got your own John Dillinger, huh?"
"- Yeah, and, like, Capone too."
Be it ever so humble.
"Yeah, where is Miss Sexy Feet?"
She's in that nest over there.
"Oh, well, you go on."
I'll wait here and observe.
Not like this.
This has to be done right.
Come on.
"Well, I see you've cleaned this up."
"Oh, yeah."
"Here, why don't you have a seat over here, Jon?"
"- No, thanks."
- You want a cold drink?
- Yeah.
What do you got?
- Let me see.
Got a little apple juice and a piece of watermelon left over from the Fourth.
July Fourth?
"- Well, this is almost..."
"- Yeah, I know."
It's a little dried out.
I'll pass.
"You know, I could do it like in the movies."
I could walk over and borrow a cup of sugar or flour.
"Yeah, if you could find a cup."
Are you kidding?
I know where everything is in here.
Lucky it was that pole and not my leg.
"Now, what do you think?"
Sugar or flour?
- Hello?
- It's me.
You ready?
"Listen, tell Michael not to let the sauce stick."
Keep stirring it.
- Henry says don't let the sauce stick.
- I'm stirring it.
"- Listen, you know what to do?"
"- Yeah, yeah."
"Don't ""yeah, yeah"" me, Lois."
This is important.
Make sure you leave the house when you make the call.
You understand me?
You hear me?
Call from an outside line.
I mean it.
"Jesus, you must think I'm dumb."
Why are you bugging me?
I know what to do.
"You little hick, just make sure you do it."
You can be such a pain.
- Hey!
Just do it!
- Okay.
Un-fucking-believable.
All of them.
Every fucking girl in my life.
- What did he say?
- Nothing.
What does she do after she hangs up with me?
After everything I told her?
"After all her ""yeah, yeah"" bullshit?"
"Don't say a word without a lawyer, even if they beat you."
- Stay strong.
- Not tonight.
Nobody's beating me.
You get out of here.
I don't want you mixed up in this.

- What the fuck is that thing in his hands?
"- No, ma'am, not a terrorist."
- He's just an idiot.
- This is just a bong.
He said he got a bomb!
"No, people, it's a water pipe for tobacco."
"No, no, no, it's not a bomb."
It's just a bong.
Poison gas!
It's marijuana!
Marijuana!
"You picked the wrong plane, you terrorist fuck!"
Hey!
"Hey, what are you doing?"
There are three air marshals on board.
Three!
We are not terrorists!
"Sir, that's a bong, not a bomb."
I can't get my bearings.
You need a stiff drink.
Come on.
Let's go get a drink.
BALLROOM
These things still go on!
Anyway...
Where'd that guy go with my suitcase?
- You got conned.
So they stole that too.
Now I have nothing left.
Oh well.
At least you can't lose anything that way.
"Well, well."
Biberkopf!
You've been gone a long time.
A beer and two patties.
Coming up.
- Wait.
- What?
Let me.
So you help out here?
No male admirers around?
"- No, none."
"- In that case, another beer."
Cheers.
Who's that with Cilly?
"A beer driver, maybe."
Can't believe she'd go for that type.
His name's Biberkopf.
I know him from before.
Just out of prison.
"That's very funny, Shrek, but I know it's you doing this."
"Hey, I..."

No way!

Aah!
- Donkey!
"- Oh, my goodness!"
Aah!
Ha ha ha ha!
Ah...
"Well, that's what I'd call a knight to remember."
What do you say we scare ourselves up some dinner?
I'd say...
"Grab the kids, and let's get going."
And that's why we're the kings of Halloween.
He was so scared.
You probably won't see him for a month.
So what else have you got in your bag of tricks?
Hmm.
I've got seven eggs.
Perfect.
I love this holiday.
Hey!
I am not happy!
Run!
Run for your life!
- Keep away!
Keep away!
- Take it!
Get away.

Don't go away. I'll go put some on.

Don't stand there.
I'd never ask you to dance.
I feel like dancing with someone handsome!

"Sam, the record's stuck!"
"Watch it, don't get fresh!"
It's you who's getting fresh.

Please just go.
Don't do this.
Talk to me.
David...
I know you weren't at the bank vault.
I followed you to the lock-up...
- I don't care any more.
- Is that where Julie-Ann died?
"If you jump, they'll say you did it."
I didn't!
I'd never hurt her.
But you were her boyfriend and you never came forward.
"David, I know about you and Julie-Ann."
No.

He didn't say when he'd be back.
I'm terribly sorry.
"But as you probably know, Lynn and I are concerned about Stan."
I had a feeling that something was wrong with Stan.
A hunch.
So I drove out to see if everything was okay.

It was nice to see you again.

"Let me get to class, get some education like you."
All right.
Uh... I don't wanna bug you. I just came in here to say good luck.
"So, tomorrow's the big day, huh ?"
Yeah.
- You scared ?
- Shitless.
You got a minute foryour old man ?
I wanna show you something.
Sure.
Be careful.
"That wall, it's, uh, still wet."
"That'syourmother when she was 19, when I fiirst met her."
You didn't eat the turkey sandwich I brought you last night.
I know you must be hungry.
So I...
I've prepared a protein drink and a wonderfully nutritious salad.
"Looks good, doesn't it?"
Doesn't it?
Yes.
You look pale.
- Do you have a fever?
- No.
Let me see.
Watch what you're doing.
Damn it.
I don't have time to change.
It's getting late.
- Are you going out?
"- Yes, I'm going out."
Where?
"Well, let's just say I'm..."
I'm going to make a house call.
What does that mean?
"That's my business, Mrs. Carrington."
Just as I want you to make it your business to clean up that mess.
And to eat something before I get back.
Hello.
I'm Dr. Travers.
"Yes, please come in, you've been expected."
"Why, thank you."
"Anna, please take Dr. Travers' coat."
Thank you very much.
Mrs. Carrington?
Yes.
Hi.
Who's Mrs. Frederic?
"I'd tell you, but then he'd have to kill you."
What do you think?
6th to constitution?
This time of day I'd take 9th.
"Yeah, you're right."
Want to grab a beer after we drop off these two jokers?
"Ah, I can't. in-laws are in town."
"Hey, hey, hang on."
I want to pull over
And grab a paper.
They'll be fine.
"Before you say anything,"
I know that I mangled this.
I know I ran in there impulsively
Without--without thinking--without my bag--
Because I had a bigger--someone dug you up.
Oh.
So you know.
It's Macpherson.
I'm right.
"Yes, I'm afraid you are."
Now it's up to you to stop him.
Thank you.
Don't move!
"So, Mr. Ogawa, when does he get here?"
"Oh, God."
It works.
"- Hello, Arthur."
- James.
Good to see you after all these years.
To concentrate for a few days.
"I see, where to?"
There's this town called Shinduri.
On the west coast.
But I heard a sandstorm's on its way.
And it's supposed to be nasty.
- Sandstorm?
Again?
"- Yes, a nasty one, too."
So why don't you wait a couple of days and then go?
I have a strange feeling about today.
Okay.
"Well, I'll work hard on it."
"Producer Jung, everything's fine with you, too?"
"So, do you still have some money left for expenses?"
"Ah, yes."
A little.
"Later perhaps, you can..."
Thank you.
"Well, take care."
Good luck with your script.
- Thank you.
- Bye.
- Sit here!
"- No, the backseat's fine."
"- Please, sit here."
"- No, I'm okay."
Hello.
We're off.
"Wow, it's a new car."
Really nice.
Did you pay for it?
Get the hell out of here Danny!
You drunk!
***
***
- What's wrong with him?
"- Oh, Danny was so mean to him this morning."
I can still totally picture it.
"So it all started when Justin, he woke up."
He was in a great mood.
"He was like, man, I love being in love, man."
I just love it.
Makes me wanna do the moonwalk.
I could do the moonwalk.
I could get jiggy with it.
I could...
I could spin.
I could jump.
I could dance for days and days but I'm not.
I'm just gonna stand completely still.
Completely still.
Still like a stone.
Like a stone.
"And then... and then Danny,"
We pan over to Danny and Danny was all like grrr.
I think love is stupid.
Getting married.
"Getting married, ""pfft""."
That's all like a dumb mistake.
I would never do that.
And I get to be mean to you for just no reason because I'm a big baby.
I'm a big baby.
My hair's too long to be a baby but I act like a baby anyways.
"- Yes, no, yes."
"- Come on, come on."
"Yes, yes, oh yes."
All right.
I've deliberated.
No retrial.
Order.
"I said, order!"
Order in this court.
There will be order.
"S-h-u- you know what, comrade?"
"I'm getting a little tired of spelling ""Shuckton."""
It's a little town with a big heart and it is really easy to spell.
"Well, I am trying to speak to the Mayor of Russia."
"What do you mean, you don't have a m..."
"Look, do you people want to rape our land or not?"
Rape.
Rape!
R-a- never...
You know what?
Never mind!
Travis!
That's my name.
I'm gonna need a power shake.
And by power shake you mean Martini.
Yes.
But I'm gonna call it a power shake.
"But it is still a quadruple Martini, right?"
Yes.
"Ah, I'm on it."
Prosecution calls it's witness.
"Thank you, your honour."
I see.
No nausea?
No vertigo?
Here.
Now?
No.
Not at all.
OK.
I'll be able to send a positive report to the insurance then.
You were lucky.
But I wouldn't recommend these little escapades.
At least not unprepared.
Going out won't kill me?
Your respiratory system and your heart are very weak.
It's summer time.
You were dressed for the North Pole.
Yes.
Well.
Thank you.
Doctor.
Goodbye.
The member you require is no longer connected to Visiocom.
Shit.
"You have selected Eva, but she no longer works here."
Damn!
It's you.
- I'd like to talk to Eva.
She doesn't work here anymore.
I must find her.
- You must do nothing.
You've done enough.
She lost her job.
I'm the friggin' host of the show.
"Oh, okay."
We're being interviewed by a 12 year old.
Hi.
"I'm 14, and my show gets the most hits on Viddimension."
- You dig?
- Yeah.
I dig.
"I guess ""dig's"" back in."
"Now, I hope you noobs are ready 'cause I've played your beta, and I got some serious questions for you guys."
So who's gonna walk me through the demo downloads?
- I hope it's you.
"- Uh, I will."
- Come on.
"Yeah, that's a good idea."
"- Yeah, that's awesome."
Hi.
"Oh, hey, you must be Suzanne."
"I'm Deena, Dave's wife."
Of course.
Really nice to meet you.
Dave's told me so much about you.
"Oh, not too much, I hope."
Hi.
Hey... honey.
What are you doing here?
"- Hi, honey."
- What are you doing here?
"Well, you know, today's a big day for you, so I just, uh--"
I'm--I'm glad you came.
And I finally get to meet the famous Suzanne.
"- I just can't believe it's taken this long-- - oh, it's been really crazy."
Right there.
Darren vogel.
That's enright's attorney.
"Yeah, vogel bought a pair of the cuff links"
A week before the murder.
Think that's a coincidence?
"Not a chance, eric."
Oh...
Looks like we've got some babysitters.
"Have a nice day, gentlemen."
"well, what are you doing?"
What...
What are you wearing?
"Get off the phone, please."
bunny?
Yeah.
"No, I'll buy it for you, I'll buy it."
Excuse me.
"Uh, I think we've got a prospective client here."
"Yes, I-I've got to go."
All right.
"Yeah, all right."
I'll see you at 7:00.
"Yeah, love you."
"Now, you boys know that my billing rate is $2,000 an hour."
But here's the good news:
I take euros.
We are not soliciting counsel.
We're here about the tony enright case.
Enright?
Come on.
"That's old history, isn't it?"
"""Where's Behzad?"""
"She said, ""He took a towel and went out."""
You weren't down near the spring.
I tried the other side but you weren't there either.
You weren't at the spring.
How can you cross?
There's a bridge.
You don't ask how I am?
Where were you?
We've had no news from you.
Nothing!
I work in the fields.
You're always working or at school.
Or sleeping.
Mind you don't fall.
- You call that a bridge?
- Yes.
Your personal bridge?
All the children use it.
- How are you?
- Okay.
How's the invalid?
Who?
You still ask who?
It's obvious.
"- Oh, Mrs Malek?"
- Yes.
She didn't eat the soup from Mash Hajer and the others.
How many cooks does she have?
They're not her cooks.
The soup is an offering.
All right.
A small chill by the column?
"No, a great chill."
"In addition, one is going away to me to melt."
"-Then, it is very urgent."
-It is what I am saying to him.
And if Lella had to be late?
It would be a disaster.
Then I to me leave orders before she is too much behind schedule.
Mother mine!
In fact...!
I am going to eat you!
-A moment.
"Before, undress."
-you quiet...
How long you take in uninformed?
Ever since I was born.
By where one begins?
"Hey, Gloria..."
-Álvaro!
-Lella!
So that is your fiancee.
You pick in your subjects.
And what do you do here?
I had brought you an ice cream for your birthday.
What do you do dressed like this?
You seem one whore.
"Alvaro, I..."
What I do with this?
Not even I like.
To the devil!
Lella.
-By the way?
Don't bother me.
Stealing is bothering.
Nobody steals anything on my shift.
Yeah!
Wha... we've been locked in here all day.
I don't buy it.
"I don't buy it, either."
I think I know who likes chocolate.
Everybody.
"Yes, right."
But especially kids.
I heard this one say she wants to put her face and her feet in it.
I stand by that.
It's gotta be in here somewhere.
Would you be dumb enough to hide it in here?
"I guess you're dumb enough to think we would hide it in there, Ethan."
"Yeah, you gorgeous idiot."
Or maybe you kids hid it in the bathroom.
Whew...!
"Eh, maybe give it a minute in there."
It's not in there.
"Get up, Rudy."
N-No.
Beans didn't do anything.
He doesn't have a malicious bean in his bag.
No!
No!
Don't you touch Beanbag!
No!
All right!
Bonus round.
Winner takes all.
Be a fucking 'nother Toxie.
TRENT HAAGA:
"All right, no problem."
"And In fact, I want that other guy."
I want you to get-- hey.
"Rhonda, Rhonda."
"We're gonna sign that other guy, and we're gonna pay him."
So we can't do the first 12 feet?
"No, Lloyd won't do it."
He's fucking pissed at me.
He's pissed at everybody.
He's totally psycho.
This is a super long shot over the tops
Of the heads of crowds.
We got fog and--
I was gonna carry them both up.
Yeah.
Wasn't that good?
That was excellent.
You know what I mean?
I agree.
But--
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"OK, let's do it?"
Can we just--
Unbelievable.
All right?
And it looks like shit.
It's gonna look like shit.
I can't get through that little flag there.
But this guy can.
"He's a half inch taller than Tito, for christ sake."
"Okay, I'll meet you over there."
You got it.
Come on!
Didn't tell me it was this heavy.
Hey!
"Hey, what the fuck are you guys doin' in here, huh?"
"You got a problem, buddy?"
"Uh, no-no problem."
"No, you ain't got no problem, right?"
That's right.
"Just be cool, motherfucker."
"Yo, Bobby..."
"Yo, yo, come here, man."
Hold this one.
Come on.
"Now, I advise you two to take that beer out the trunk of your car."
"And I advise you, smiley, to put that knife away."
You advise?
That's a pretty big word for a nigger.
- Yeah.
"- Oh, fuck!"
[Grunting]
[Box cracking]
"You okay, buddy?"
"Yeah, sure."
"Well, let's get rid of these turkeys and clean up this mess, huh?"
- Hey.
- Hmm?
Thanks.
You okay?
"Yeah, sure."
"Hey, how do you feel about goin' to shoot some pool?"
"Yes, I think."
Thank you!
Thank you?
By words only?
Earlier your smile was beautiful.
Can you smile again?
I don't like to smile!
Really?
"You don't like to smile,"
- or you don't like me?
- Let go of me!
Let me go!
Let me drive you home.
Why do you keep bothering me?
Why?
"It's not bothering, it's love!"
"If I tell you that I don't like you, will you stop what are you doing?"
What you do is not love!
Didn't I tell you that I have a boyfriend already?
So what?
"As long as I like you, I will make you fall in love with me!"
Xiamu...
Xiamu!
Xiamu!
Xiamu!
- Are you allright?
- I'm allright!
Did you get injured?
Don't come near Shu Yawang anymore!
"I come near to her,"
- so what?
- I'll kill you!
There's not even any fuckin' silverware in this place.
Oh no.
What?
What is it?
There's no beer.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Oh shit.
"Come on, come on."
Oh shit.
"Blair, Ollie."
Did you find it?
No.
The skylight is sealed shut.
How did you open it in the first place?
It was already wide open.
I just went through.
Us too.
He's back.
"Yeah, well we got a fuckin' gun."
Why don't we use it?
There's only one bullet.
"Riley, how many bullets did you bring?"
"Well, you only need one bullet to take 'em out, right?"
Technically that's true.
So here's the plan.
No way.
Guns and Riley don't mix.
Will you stop insulting my crew?
"You guys, no new plans."
"We stay together, and we find the jammer, okay."
Where?
We already checked everywhere.
- Valentine's day?
That's in two weeks.
"Give me the sandwich, Will."
Hold my beer.
I need to talk like an old Italian lady.
What are you talking about?
Is there something you're not telling me?
Are you pregnant?
Did Candace put a baby in you?
I know you're joking but I would happily carry that baby.
"Morning sickness, stretch marks."
I want it all.
There's a point.
I think it's a little weird Especially you.
"Look, I get it."
"You feel like I'm breaking up the best on-screen duo since ""Will  Grace."""
I just want to make sure you're not bummed out.
I'm not bummed.
I'm totally cool.
"Hey, whose Twitter handle is cool Danny?"
Hm?
Not mine.
Not mine.
You know why?
I'm too cool for that.
Ah.
That sucks.
Danny.
"Yes, my sweet little Will?"
Don't be a bitch.
Oh.
I can't wait to dance at your wedding.

Daddy lets us play.
I don't care what your father does.
This is important.
I want you to look at me.
- Alright then.
- Excuse me?
Nothing.
The doctor told me to rest.
And I expect support.
There are some new rules.
I want absolute silence in the house.
I need sleep.
"If it's important, you knock."
And no visitors.
"If someone asks, tell them mom's sick."
We keep the curtains closed.
I need to avoid sunlight.
"You play alone in the garden, very quiet."
You take nothing inside.
"No branches, no animals ..."
What are you doing?
We start over.
Well?
We need to keep this family together.
One for me and one of Luke.
Very nice.
I meant what I just said.
"We're sticking to this plan, huh?"
Good.
Now it's bedtime.
Goodnight.
- She is so different.
I have you.
They're wonderful.
You must let me try one on.
It is good to be working at my trade again.
It's just a pity you have to make them for her.
What is the hatter with me?
Hatter?
(CHAINS RATTLING)
(THUNDER CRASHING)
Hatter.
Have you any idea why a raven is like a writing desk?
"I'm frightened, Alice."
I don't like it in here.
It's terribly crowded.
Have I gone mad?
I'm afraid so.
You're entirely bonkers.
But I'll tell you a secret.
All the best people are.
Here.
That's better.
You look yourself again.
RED QUEEN:
Hat man!
Where are my hats?
I'm not a patient monarch!
I'm told she keeps the Vorpal sword hidden in the castle.
The rabbit will help you.
"Find it, Alice."
Take it to the White Queen.
We'll go to the White Queen together.
Why is it you're always too small or too tall?
Colton!
Colton Graham can help us out.
- No!
Fuck that!
- Yes!
No doubt.
"If anyone could clear your names, it's him."
"No, I'm sorry."
That dickweed is not helping us.
Wait a second.
Do you have his contact info?
Not anymore.
"But the wedding is at his family's estate in Hewitt, Texas."
"But you don't want to bother them when they're doing their whole... wedding thing, right?"
"You know, that actually might be our only hope."
Fuck!
How do we get there?
We can't go to the airport.
They're looking for us.
- I'll loan you one of my cars.
- Really?
But first...y'all got to get in the spirit of the party.
"- What do you mean, spirit of--"
- What do you think I mean?
- What about you?
- Me?
I've been in the spirit.
"- Oh, God!"
"- Oh, my God, dude!"
"Oh, my God!"
"- Love your dickdo, Raza."
- Yeah.
You could have got someone to post it for you.
"Oh, Come on."
You could've got your mum to post it.
I don't bloody know.
You wanted an alibi.
- Maybe you sent it.
You're blaming me..
- Bullshit!
"Oh, it's you."
You sent it!
Don't listen to him.
"Chris, just fucking admit it!"
Enough.
I want a confession.
We'll keep playing until we get one.
"Truth or Dare, Chris?"
Dare.
You fuck.
Dare it is.
One moment.
"Luke, Luke!"
"- Luke, what the fuck?"
- Help us.
"- I can't, I can't."
- Please.
"We used to call this... the ""acid test."""
Easy to improvise.
"Very, um... useful for motivating prisoners."
"This next part... isn't terribly pretty, I'm afraid."
Open up.
Open up.
"Now, this is much easier... if you relax."
"I think you hit it again, sir."

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
"Ready when you are, Mr. Fowler."
Be right there.
"Oh, sir, if you didn't think I was gonna be in the way,"
I would love to...
No.
Not at all.
Be my guest.
"Oh, thank you very much, sir."
I appreciate that.
"Excuse me, sir."
"I don't wanna appear grabby, but do you think I could have one of these, sir?"
Certainly.
As many as you want.
That's the usual publicity nonsense.
"Ward Fowler this, Ward Fowler that."
Nothing.
"Nothing to you sir, but to my wife..."
"Boy, she's gonna be tickled pink."
(CLEARS THROAT)
But blend it on.
All right.
No.
"I mean blend it, especially on this side."
"Oh, I see."
All right.
Like that?
I can't tell.
"Oh, am I in the way, sir?"
"Oh, forgive me."
You think?
I think you're really brave.
To consider rebuilding who you are.
I don't know if I could do that.
You could.
"- Well, I gotta go."
- Oh yeah.
"Hey, um, practice starts back up again today, right?"
"Yeah, I'm just not sure if I do."
I'll see ya.
All work and no Brooke make Luke a boring boy.
- Hey.
- I got you something.
But I don't have anything for you.
And yet you do.
A couple of songs on there that made me think of you.
Of course most things do.
I didn't know you were into Travis.
"Are you kidding, I love Travis."
He's the best.
Who?
Travis guy.
Are we not in the same conversation?
Check out tracks 8 and 13.
You'll love them.
Bye.
Thought you might want that back.
I already have it.
So do I.
Tracks 8 and 11?
Totally you.
So what are you doing?
"Gosh bro, this isn't hard to understand!"
Love is like a disease.
You can treat it.
I will prescribe you some medicine.
"Here, shrimp dumplings."
Just eat this yummy stuff you like.
It will help.
"One more thing, you have to find something to do."
So you won't be free to think too much.
Working is good.
Way back when I was like you broken-hearted.
I almost flunked out of college.
I kept working.
"Then forgot everything, even being broken-hearted."
"Stop being sad, no time for that."
Just worked.
It works!
Songkran I am free.
A 2-day deadline that's doable.
Yes.
"Yes, sir."
Hi everybody.
I am back!
Rash: 1 spot
I've got my life back.
Hello.
Hello.
This is Peng.
Are you free?
I have a job for you.
I'm free.
That's what I like about you.
So?
"So, like, our first time shouldn't be in a car."
Don't worry about me.
I don't need the whole candles and roses thing if you don't.
- I don't.
- Great.
"So, come here and kiss me."
- Could you...
less tongue?
"- Sure, sure."
Slower.
"Ok, switch."
- Kiss my neck.

It's almost time for my curfew.
We better...
I better get home.

"Uh, Sarah?"
What should I make us for dinner?
"Don't you mean, what should you order in?"
"No, I cook."
S-sometimes I cook.
"Yeah, I'd wait for mom if I were you."
"Wow, look at you."
"Yeah, please don't."
"I look like I walked off the set of ""7th Heaven"" or something."
"I hope you don't mind, I put my clothes in the wash."
And since everything else I own is in Martin's van...
It's totally fine.
What's that?
This is fettuccine bolognese.
Wow.
"Props, dad."
Thanks.
Hello?
Tom?
"Yeah, we're in the kitchen."
Sarah.
"Hey, mom."
"Um, dad said it'd be ok if I came home with him."
"Of course it's ok, if you're here to stay."
"Sarah's here for dinner, which, uh... is actually going to be ready momentarily, so..."
"So, what was it this time?"
"Did you run out of money, or did you have another fight with Martin?"
"Yeah, it was a big mistake."
I really shouldn't have come here.
"Sarah, wait."
No I mean we've hung out a lot but...
nope.
Well if you were telling me you were just going to leave him to the uneducated models in LA then I am going to have to jump his bones.
For both of us.
So are you an actress?
No no not really.
I thought I was for a minute but.
Turns out it's not for me.
Way too much self-analyzing.
So what do you do now?
I design jewelry.
These are mine.
They're very nice.
- Thanks.
Did you hear?
Hear what?
Zaps magazine just named you number one in their Hottest Man Alive issue.
Yes!
Can I...
"Oh, come on are you kidding?"
"I mean come on Cece, it's Zaps magazine."
Yeah.
- It's not exactly...
Wait you're leaving?
Yeah where's Becca?
She's with the producer.
Make sure she gets home OK.
Ok!
Bye... mwa.
Hang on excuse me for one second.
"Hey, Dale..."
Hey Dale.
They've got a gym...
"Come on, Mom."
Please.
This is ridiculous.
It's what I chose to do.
I'm going to find a place soon.
- And you really think you can start over?
- You mean at my age?
"- Yes, yes I do."
"- I'm still breathing, aren't I?"
I'm still here.
It's a long time ago.
Daddy'll understand.
"No, that's..."
That's not the point of this.
You've been together since college.
Yup.
And do you know how miserable I've been almost the whole time?
- I don't think that's true.
"- Well, I've just kept it from you."
"Yeah, trust me, Mom, you're not that good at hiding your emotions."
Really?
I'm sorry.
You make this difficult because you want it that way.
Men are easy.
"And you've been with Michael, what,"
"- three years, right?"
- Yeah.
And it took me less than half an hour to figure him out.
- Wow.
"Oh, you're lucky."
Jeez.
See?
We haven't got a proper officer so we get pushed about like potboys.
He's not a proper officer.
Never seems to tire.
Hard to catch him off guard.
"He let you off light, Sharpe, back in the village."
So why so hard?
"He's just not right, Cooper."
He's not happy being an officer.
And mark my words he'll bring us bad luck
We'll do it tomorrow.
In the mountains.
Vale.
The fire's started.
Prepare to fight
Down
Get down!
Or I'll kill him
Rifles!

"Oh, my God."
"Young Perkins, sir."
Not a sound.
No!
No!
"Perkins, I want you to protect this pennant with your life."
"Yes, sir."
"Never say die, Perkins."
"Never again, sir."
They'll be back for them two.
Up!
Keep moving!
like some company?
"Yes, I would."
Hi.
"Hi, Andy."
"Hi, boss."
Hi.
Did you hear that?
That was bad.
"That was very, very bad."
Want a date?
I don't think that's going to work.
That's Reverend Whitehead.
God doesn't let him do that.
Got you an ice cream.
Being on the job probably makes you hungry.
Thanks.
What are you doing here?
Looking for you.
Where are you going to sleep tonight?
"In a hotel, if you'll get lost and let me make some money."
I-I don't think you should be doing this.
"What are you, some kind of child missionary?"
Sort of.
I did have an idea about the sleeping thing.
"Hi, Frank."
She spoke to me.
"I speak to her, but she never speaks to me."
"Hey, Frank, going to the dance?"
I-I can't dance.
"Me, neither."
"Aren't you going to introduce us to your friend, Frank?"
"I'm Frank's father's sister, Aunt V, and Frank and I are very, very close, aren't we, Frank?"
- Good.
"Sifu, there's a tailor outside... to make your birthday robe."
- What?
He said he wanted to make a new robe for you.
Ask him in.
BIRTHDAY ROBE TAILOR
I thought you were the tailor Thao.
Thao has gone back to his village.
"Sifu Wong, can I take your measurements?"
OK.
"If you wear what I make for you, you'll look good."
"Why don't you make one for yourself, too?"
"- Front chest, 24 inches."
Strong torso.
- Thank you.
"Arm, three feet."
What sleeve do you want?
Literati style.
"Sleeve width, six inches."
Two feet split.
"Height, five feet."
1.8 for the shoulder.
"Waist, 30."
Do you need a nail to take measurements?
A button was loose.
I was trying to fix it.
"Oh, thank you."
Any time.
Let me measure your neck.
"Collar height, two inches."
- Are you done?
"- If you'd stayed still, I'd have finished."
"Sergeant Beecham shoved that junkie into a lamp post and he said, ""I'll keep you posted""?"
"Oh, yeah."
I heard about that.
"Yeah, everybody heard about it."
"I mean, people were repeating it."
It was famous.
This is even better.
This is a classic.
If you say so.
"Yeah, I just need to pick the right moment."
Captain?
"If you're ready to release the body,"
I can take her downtown.
Okay.
I still don't get it.
Who would want to kill the lotto girl?
I guess her number came up.
Hey!
What are you doing?
"Hey, what are you doing?"
"That was my line, man."
What are you talking about?
I just said the exact same thing two seconds ago.
Ask the Captain.
"Randy, this is a crime scene."
For God's sakes...
No.
You heard me.
Yeah.
You know what?
He must have heard me.
Huh?
"Uh, is everything okay today?"
Why wouldn't it be?
No reason.
"So, what do you want to lay down today?"
"Uh, no."
No bets.
I'm just going to cool it today.
Thanks.
So why did you call me?
"Uh, shit."
"I got to go, Ivan."
I'll talk to you later.
So what does that mean?
"It means we wait 10 hours, figure out what the hell's happening."
"Babe, can we talk?"

"Hey, Ivan."
What a surprise.
"I was wondering why you showed up tonight, and then it occurred to me."
It's probably 'cause I called you like a paranoid fucking idiot.
(HITS WALL)
"Hey, Ivan."
What a surprise.
What are you doing?
He's going to be here soon.
You can't leave me alone.
"Well, I'm not in the picture, so, send me a text message when it's done?"
"Well, I-"
"I'm not in the photo either, so... maybe I should leave too?"
"Don't worry, Goni."
They'll be leaving soon.
"Mr. Ben-Shmuel,"
I'd like you to come down to the station with me.
Now?
"- Yes, now."
I don't want you to go.
I'll just go for an hour.
"Finish the bookshelf, then go through the house."
He'll stay here to finish.
Sorry for the disturbance.
Alex?
The police came and took Yitzhak.
I don't know.
- Detention center-
Will Daddy come home with us?
"I don't know, Goni."
Is it because of the policemen who came to the house?
- Yes.
What did they find?
- I don't know.
Then why did they take him?
Did he do something wrong?
"No, he didn't."
"Always remember that, Goni."
When will Daddy come home?
"I don't know, Goni."
He said he'd be back in an hour.
They took him to ask questions.
Are they allowed to?
- Yes.
Can we spend Saturday with him?
"Yeah well, let's call it my retirement plan."
You killed Yale.
And Paolo.
You dragged them into this.
Now give me the fucking numbers.
You're outta luck asshole.
I forgot 'em years ago.
Really?
Oh you did?
I don't think so.
"- Papa, please help us."
- Please...
Mama?
You know it's gonna take me a little while to get to Zurich so make yourselves at home.
There's a bottle of Chateau Le Fit in the cellar.
You kids knock yourselves out.
I'll see you at the bank at four.
You remember where that is.
"'Kay, we're not staying here."
And I am not letting you out of my sight.
Get her ready to go.
Hurray.
"No, no."
Please.
- Please.
- Listen.
Listen to me.
Listen.
"You say nothing about this, and your daughter will be home tonight."
Talk to anyone and she's dead.
You understand what I'm saying.
"Look, I"
- l gave all that to Missing Persons.
"Okay, mister."
Okay.
"I'll handle this, Willie."
"Thanks, Willie."
- Fished this one out of the Gulf.
- Pass.
- Hit and run.
"- No, he's too old."
- What'd he look like?
- Medium.
- Medium what?
"- Medium young, medium height."
- Medium weight.
- Very illuminating.
"You can call him medium, what's left of him."
Barracuda got the rest.
That's the lot.
- All the rest empty?
- Yeah.
Not much business f or the one cool spot in town.
"- One just came in, but he don't fit."
- How do you know?
- You said suicide.

This one came f rom a car smash.
You don't want to see him.
- l might as well blanket the field.
- He's as crisp as bacon.
- l can stand it if you can.
- Okay.
He was like a lump of charcoal.
"Now, wait a minute."
Josephine was abducted from her husband.
Tony was abducted from his wife.
You think these couples represent a happiness he covets?
[Morgan] Or something he lost.

I'm sorry.
(Jo) Not in the least.
"Dr McKenna, do you -"
"Why don't all of you sort of turn around here, or something."
It's kind of - kind of hard on the neck.
(Mr Drayton) It's in one of our English counties.
It's not what you'd call a farm.
It's more of a small holding.
Here we are.
- 0h.

Yes.
- There we are.

"Yes, just break it, just like this."
"It won't break. 0h, no."
"Well, I'm gonna"
- There.
- ls that the way you do it?
- That's quite alright.
That was a tough one.
Does it chew any better than it tears?
- ls it fattening?
- l imagine it must be.
Yeah.
"Yeah, it really is."
No.
Mom...
"Squirt, where the heck's your mom?"
I know I asked you to be my stepdad.
Do you mind being my friend instead?
"So Julie's had enough of the old Bullit, eh?"
We can still play ping-pong together.
Come on.
"You know, I let you win."
"No, you don't."
"Yes, I do."
In your dreams.
You ever see that movie Casablanca?
No.
It goes like this:
"Peanut, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."
"Come on, luck be a lady, luck be a lady."
Oh!
"I can't believe this, I didn't win."
Shocking.
"Well, if it's any consolation, though, this soft serv is outstanding."
Would anyone like seconds?
"Yeah, I would."
"Yeah, me, too."
Thank you.
Sorry things didn't work out with you and Julie.
Hey...
I'm sitting here sharing ice cream with my kid.
It's been a long time since I've done that.
Tell me that's her.
Sats 88.
He's not talking anymore.
Why is he not talking?
Because he can't.
Let's Betadine the whole chest just in case.
- You need any help?
- Yes.
With his wife.
She's bleeding.
- I'm not his wife.
- Then you shouldn't be here.
- Where's the rapid infuser?
- Got it.
We need that blood.
Let's get her on a monitor.
She refused treatment for chest pain at the scene.
I'm Dr. Kovac.
Come with me.
- No.
Somebody needs to be with him.
"- Okay, I'm in."
- Hook me up.
- Let us take care of him and Dr. Kovac will take care of you.
Please.

"Lewis, what are you doing up there?"

'Cause I am not a slot machine.
You are a slot machine.
"Step right up here, folks, there's a winner every minute."
Sorry.
"Oh, what, l-I hurt your feelings?"
No.
"No, and you want to know why?"
'Cause you don't got no feelings.
"Yes, I do."
"I'm a person, and I have feelings."
"Oh, ho, you're a person now."
"Hey, she's not a person, is she, Betty?"
"Yeah, she sort of is."
Nobody's talking to you.
"You know what the test is, baby?"
"If you were a person, you could do whatever you want..."
Ow.
"and you can't, 'cause you do whatever I tell you to do, isn't that right, Betty?"
Y eah.
We got in an accident.
"Oh, my God!"
We almost got in an accident.
That seems like a really important distinction.
"There was this big truck, and it barreled through a stop sign, and it missed our car by inches."
"Oh, my God!"
And everyone's okay?
"- Yes, just very shaken up."
- Aw.
"But, Mitchell, I am so sorry that I yelled at you before."
It's fine.
"Look, I brought you the birthday card for mom,"
- and you can sign it.
- Okay.
Thank you.
"- ""To our best friend."""
- Mm.
That's a little sarcastic.
It's her birthday.
- I don't know.
"- No, I mean it."
"Mitchell, I almost died."
I want our mom to have a great birthday.
"Oh, and we're doing this again."
- Okay.
"- Oh, God."
Yeah.

Have a nice day!
You better watch yourself... or you'll find yourself... packing your shampoo and spot creams.
"I'm sorry, you'll have to discuss it with my solicitor."
Don't you start.
Now...
Sharon has a bit of news for yous.
I can't help it.
"I'm sorry, Sharon."
"Go on, love."
I'm going to have a baby.
"- That's massive, Sharon."
- Is that all?
"Women, what?"
Right.
Where's your bump?
- Stop that!
"Hey, what are you doing?"
"- Don't worry Miss Morgan, I'll call the police."
"Don't call the police, this is my husband!"
- He doesn't have a key?
- Don't ask.
"See, I told you I know her better than you."
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
What... what... what is going on?
What are you doing here?
"Well, I..."
I came to see YOU.
Why?
- Why did you come to see me?
- Well...
I...
"In... in... in light of our last conversation, and after speaking with Henry, I..."
I...
I've come to realize... that... alth... alth... alth...
although you might... might have significant reservations about e... e... even considering...
Gregory!
What!
I'm aging here.
What is it you want to say?
"God, you're beautiful."
Thank you.
"Thank you, Gregory."
What?
"I'm so sorry... for the way I acted and for the things I said, I..."
"- I know that I hurt you, and..."
- That's okay.
- Also why would we die?
- Can I interrupt for a second?
I just want to say that I love both of you guys.
Trent more than I did before.
OK.
"Well, just so you know, I hate both of you."
Do you want any oil before we start?
No.
"Please, I... that wasn't in the script."
Sounds like we're ready to go.
Let's get started.
Ah.
"Three, two, one."
Hit it!
None of my moves are sexual.
I apologize.
- Wow!
"- Yeah, wow."
That was an amazing story.
"Hey, Danny."
You have to tell us if you got the ring back when you get back from the bathroom.
"Hey, yeah."
OK.
Just give me a few seconds.
- Flashbacks are exhausting.
"- Hell, yeah."
So look.
The stripper scouts turned out that they loved us.
And so did the audience.
So...
Anyway.
"OK, well."
That too without a weapon.
"Baby, in this life, I am the tiger."
Got it?
I'll bite if someone tries to touch me.
- Tiger?
- Yes.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
Let's go.
What?
"Everything's set, right?"
"Yes, everything is set."
I'll take a plane and go straight to Budapest.
From there I'll go to the embassy and then I'll come to get you.
"Otherwise, you'll get stuck in the water."
And no one has seen my face so there is nothing to worry about.
Everything will be...
- You are scared.
- Very scared.
Scoundrel...
I too am scared.
- You look after yourself in the boat.
- I will.
We will take Lord's name.
everything will be fine.
Shiv...
- What?
She is You.
One should be ready to face danger for her.
"You take care of yourself, got it?"
You are my life.
Let's go?
I'm just letting you know.
"Okay, 10-4."
"Hop in, boys."
We got to make a stop before we head to the Malcolm place.
Open this door!
"Goddamn, Lureen!"
Harlan!
Goddamn it.
Harlan!
Settle down.
Settle down.
"Harlan, goddamn it."
(GLASS SHATTERS)
You calm down now.
Let go of me.
"You want to take a ride with me, huh?"
You want to take a ride with me?
"He laid out all night drinking, Hurricane."
Okay.
What are those men doing here?
"They're not here to take him away, are they?"
It's okay.
She locked me out.
I understand.
"I understand, I understand."
"Now look, you laid out all night drinking and you knew she was going to do this, didn't you?"
Yeah.
"You say you're sorry, I'll bet she'll let you in."
LUREEN:
He knows I will.
We'll go to church on Sunday and he'll feel a whole lot better.
You won't let them take him away?
Pen perfect?
It's not worth it.
What do you think?
It's not very good.
It's very...
Buckley.
It's not your fault in there.
Really isn't.
I better go home.
So...
Exterior train station.
"A full moon, a clear sky."
A man sits by the shore.
There has been a quarrel.
A woman is walking away from him.
Now she turns back.
I didn't mean what I just said.
And anyway...you said worse.
Hm.
Declaration...
Stupid bloody fool's good.
Did you think of that beforehand?
Are you trying to put a fight with me Mrs.Cole?
"No...what I'm trying to say is that, if all of this stopped."
"The sparring and the jibing, and the insults and the arguments."
I'd miss it.
Even if I were dead.
I'd still miss it.
The Catrin Cole school of dialog.
On and on and on and on and on.
Lose half.
Which half?
"You could have it all, my empire of dirt."
I will let you down.
I will make you hurt.
"I wear this crown of shit, upon my liar's chair."
"Full of broken thoughts, i cannot repair."
"Beneath the stain of time, the feeling disappears."
"And you are someone else,"
And I am still right here.
What have i become?
My sweetest friend.
"Everyone i know, goes away in the end."
"You could have it all, my empire of dirt."
I will let you down.
I will make you hurt.
"If i could start again, a million miles away."
I would keep myself.
I would find a way.
-One more try!
-One more try!
"-No, that didnt count!"
Thats...
"-Yeah, really..."
"Oh, we get a light, we got a ...."
Woo!
All right!
Awesome.
This way?
We can go this way...
Polaroid!
.
-Ready?
-OK!
- Whose money are you using?
"- Yours, thank you very much."
But our money belongs to us again.
What's the idea?
Remember our bet?
"You see, you didn't get married."
- I'll pay you later.
- No.
All aboard!
- But I've got to get that train.
- You mean you had to get it.
"You know, you didn't win that lucky quarter."
I'll flip you for a ticket to New York.
I don't want to go to New York.
He doesn't want to go to New York.
"Goodbye, Lucky, old boy."
So long.
"- Goodbye, Lucky."
- See you later.
"Give my regards to the folks, will you?"
Say hello to Aunt Lucy.
So long.
"Goodbye, Lucky."
"Lucky, here's your suitcase."
Here's your toothbrush.
"Boy, I'd give my life for a smoke."
"- Well, take the quarter."
"- No, sir, not the lucky one."
Wait a minute.
I'll get a smoke.
"I beg your pardon, have you got a match, please?"
Thank you.
I'm okay!
No need to be worry!
"I'd rather be the one who git hit, instead of you getting hurt!"
Do you know how afraid I was?
"How come you are still like a child, playing these?"
I haven't played them for a long time.
What a beautiful necklace!
I think I saw it somewhere.
It's nothing!
Get back!
"Xiamu, do you have a girlfriend?"
No!
Give it back to me!
- Tell me about her!
"- No, I swear!"
Give it back!
"Obviously you bought it for the girl you like, stop quibbling!"
I don't have any girlfriend!
Xiamu!
I... like you!
"Xiamu, it's only your sense of dependence."
I have been treating you like my brother.
Don't talk to me!
Keep it on your neck!
Ah...
Why are we here?
Surprise!
Are you?
It was joking!
Hello?
My dear!
Have you lunch yet?
I love vinegar.
"So, your office is in Peel House?"
I've got clients on the fourth floor.
My office is just across the square.
We're on the first floor
- Stanley Brothers.
Pop in some time.
Pauline loves a visitor.
"Right, I shall."
I shall pop!
Please...
Are you Jimmy Baker?
Yeah...
Is your mother in?
"No, she's at her other job."
"Oh, right."
"Well, how are you doing?"
Have you been out playing?
"Singing, I'm in a choir."
"I sing, with a dance band."
We've been on the wireless.
So I've actually sung on the wireless.
"I gave you a rubber ball once, do you remember?"
You would have been about three.
"It was a big, coloured ball."
Have you not still got it?
I had better go in.
Hang on a minute.
I'm off to Canada.
Pastures new...
As they say.
Have you heard that?
"Mandy, I really like you."
That's for making me fall for you.
"Aw, they're in love."
"Ah, my face!"
We got our very own chocolate fountain!
Some of it just went down my underwear.
I like it.
This is the best weekend of my life.
It doesn't even matter that I'm allergic to chocolate.
"Rudy, what?"
"Ugh, stop eating it, then."
"Oh, 'cause I'm allergic to it?"
"Yeah, what happens when you eat it?"
"I don't know, I've never eaten it."
I don't know what...
Rudy!
Rudy!
Just kidding.
"Damn it, Rudy."
It's not that bad.
I just get a rash on my back.
There's my babies.
Why are you covered in chocolate?
Why are you covered in wine?
Don't ask questions.
"Yeah, ditto."
Oh.
I feel like I French-kissed the whole train.
Uh... yum.
"Hey, Mom, did you have a nice birthday at least?"
I did.
"Wait, who told you it was my birthday?"
We will manage any expense.
Please go on and make necessary arrangements.
- Sure.
What's wrong with you?
I know what I'm doing.
The way my son saw me before 10 years
The way he likes to see me.
That's exactly how I'm dressed up.
He will cry out asking if this is what he got his vision back for!
You are jealous.
He won't even be able to identify you.
Shall I stick a mustache?
Mom!
Mom!
- Sir.
Please sit.
It's a hospital.
- Where is my mom?
She will be here.
- Who are you?
Varun!
- Mom!
Where were you?
I have no clue.
What is happening?
Nothing.
You are in a hospital.
You met with an accident.
"Varun, please don't strain."
Be calm.
You were hit by a car while getting back from the restaurant.
How long have I been kept here?
You must work faster than this.
Okay.
Day 3
"Isn't this going overboard, bro?"
Your body might fall apart.
It's okay.
I've been up for 5 days before.
Kai.
I'm really thankful that you told me to work.
It really works.
Shit.
My head is so heavy.
Day 4
Yoon.
You accepted the job from Peng?
Yeah.
You know the scale of that job is 2 months of work.
You've only got 2 weeks.
And you accepted it!
Yeah.
You know even though I...
"I didn't screen it, you should have known better."
Why did you take it?
Peng always takes advantage of people.
You're the only one who looks up to him.
You know when he said that you're the first person he thought of.
He lied!
You know that?
"At least someone thinks of me, Je."
"Thought of you, that's f*cked up."
He only cares about his job.
So he sweet talked you into taking this job.
"I was there, sure."
Boy postured like he's seasoned.
Feels light.
Which would mean a lot if you were a scale.
Do you want it or no ?
Now it is light.
I'm losing my patience.
$800 or the deal is off.
Deal's off.
I'm out of here.
"See, there's a problem with your story, Julio."
"What, no happy ending ?"
"No, whoever shot Bob left evidence of their gun on him."
Okay.
"Look, I brought an associate with me."
"New guy, loose cannon,"
"- name of Luis, Luis Rivera."
- And Luis shot Bob ?
You ask him.
"Until we find Luis, Julio, we're going to hang onto you."
"Step over to the car, please."
"Let's go, Julio."
Right over here.
Let's go.
Eric !
I don't see anyone.
"Shift into Plan ""B""."
Luis Rivera hold up.
"Luis, you got to change up your routine, man."
I didn't do nothing wrong.
"Yeah, you wake up, and you're already wrong."
Let's get him up.
He doesn't get to win.
"Farm-to-table, huh?"
[phone rings] [ring]
- Hey.
- Julia:
How's it going?
"Oh, it's okay."
What's up?
Your parents want to hang on to the kids a little longer.
"I told you, you have to beat them off with a stick."
So I'm thinking an afternoon without the flesh anchors.
Let's do a little day drinking.
I could certainly use one.
Everything okay?
"Oh, fine."
How about that place down by the marina?
Sunday's all day Happy Hour.
I love it.
"Uh, I need to finish up here."
Give me an hour?
I may have to start without you.
It's one of the reasons why I love you.
"Okay, I'll see you soon."
Okay.
Gentlemen.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
"Dr. Barrett, I'm ready to sign the papers."
You have been a terrible drinking buddy.
Why?
You've barely said two words since you got here.
You're so quiet.
I'm sorry.
I burned them.
Sorry?
I burned them.
He burned them.
Where?
Where?
In the kitchen.
In the kitchen.
Bastard!
YOu!
What did you come here to do?
What did you come here to do?
Ask him again.
What did you come here to do?
To travel.
"To travel, he says."
Tell him I'll throw him in jail if he doesn't fess up.
Tell us the truth.
"Even if I told you, you wouldn't believe me."
He says you wouldn't believe him.
"Look, you translate everything I say,"
- word for word.
"- Yes, sir."
You fucking prick!
Oh...
"You loose-assed, dog-fucking son of a whore!"
"So, uh..."
What kind of tourist hangs pictures of dead people on his wall?
Travel... the dead...
Why was this in your house?
HOW did this...?
Who the fuck are you?
Get rid of that.
Got some housekeeping to do on the cool wall.
"Anne Robinson said it's silly the TT is this far down, because it's a cool car, it needs moving up."
There.
You're doing that cos she's not here.
Exactly!
I have one - there's an omission off the cool wall.
And it's this.
Which is the Mercedes SL55 AMG.
Mmm.
What a car.
Jeremy's car!
What a car!
There is an issue with this.
It's just been bought by somebody quite famous.
Do you want to guess?
Brad Pitt.
Cameron Diaz.
way.
"Let me help you, Jeremy."
It's Dale Winton.
Dale Winton's a nice chap.
"No, he's orange."
It's uncool.
Sorry.
I'm glad you brought my car up.
I've got one I'd like to share with you.
The least cool car I've seen in a while - 1982 Porsche 911 SC.
Particularly if someone has written on the back and fitted a turbo body kit.
That's my car!
That really is your car!
"And it's hideous, so it's going here."
She drove off.
She's not rational.
Tell me the truth.
She's upset.
"Um, are you still with her?"
"Look, I told you..."
I told you we were having problems.
Are you still with her?
"All this time, you were... ..you were just lying to me about being separated."
"Technically, she was in Melbourne, I was here."
"Oh, my God."
I...
I just wanted to be with you.
"Oh, my God."
"OK, I can explain everything."
Do you know what?
Don't even bother.
Because I can see that the next word out of your mouth is gonna be a lie.
"OK, Grace, let's just be grown-up about..."
Just get out.
Let's be grown-up...
Just get out!
You heard her.
Hm?
"Now, you have fun."
That is an order.
You're going to enjoy bossing everyone around in Singapore?
Too soon to be funny.
Be happy.
Mwah.
"Rio awaits, and I've got a meeting at the office to get to."
"Oh, I'll miss you."
Yeah.
"Uh, yeah, this is much better than watching Damon visit Cougar Town."
- No offense.
- Don't remind me.
I've always wanted to see this place.
"Yeah, I guess it's a bit much."
Heh.
"Yeah, my entire house could fit in here, like, twice."
I feel like I've been here before.
It's weird.
Do you guys wanna watch a movie or something?
These are great.
That's just a little hobby of mine.
I did the entire Mustang series when I was 9.
- You like cars?
- That's an understatement.
Come with me.
"So the thing about cherries, you have to..."
Mm-mm.
"Oh, my goodness."
That's amazing.
You were quick.
And that would be my cue.
You're giving up already?
"Oh, yeah."
"See you, guys."
"Prepare yourself, my friend."
"Whoa, wait."
How do you have this?
It got passed down through the family.
Why don't you?
I mean...
"Franz, let us wear our old clothes and..."
- What else happened?
- Nothing!
Where did you first meet him?
On the streets?
"And I drive around, risking my life!"
You're a whore!
Leave me alone!
You whore!
I risk my life and work so hard!
Get out of my apartment!
Leave me alone!
Open the door!
It's my apartment!
Out!
Get out of here!
But I saved your life!
Get out!
Scoundrel!
Get out!
Out!
"Yes, she's so soft and faithful!"
I was on the verge of killing you.
Just like Ida.
I wanna be a decent man but it's so hard.
We just remain in the gutter.
"I'm going to drive to the countryside, I can't stand it here anymore."
"We still have a lot to do out there, in Weißensee."
Revenge.
Ede and Biberkopf gotta come along.
"- So, you're taking Franz with you?"
- Yes.
"No, come on."
Already?
[Laughs]
Whoo!
"Now, do me a favor."
I want you to move around with her a little bit.
See if she's worth a shit.
Come on.
"Aye, aye, captain."
This is a fucking good burger.
Did you make this?
I'm on break.
How did you find me?
"Mm, girl's got to eat."
One of mine saw you here and told me.
Ahh.
"I'm not here for you, love."
Don't worry.
What do you want?
"A couple of my girls got picked up and started talking to the cops, saying my name, talking about my business."
I've never said anything.
"I know, Chris."
"That's why you're still here enjoying your new life, spending time with your sons."
The other girls aren't so lucky.
Anyway.
"Point is, if the cops do show up asking you questions,"
I hope you forget my name.
"Of course, Terry."
I'd never say anything.
Sure.
I know you wouldn't.
Ah.
Promise you'll do it.
Not until you tell me what's going on.
"Okay look, just get out of your apartment."
Turn off your cell phone.
I'll call you at the inn as soon as I can.
Go now.
Okay.
Tell Julia I love her.
Mama?
Right.
Who's Julia?
She's my daughter.
You were married.
Kyra's a friend of mine.
We both wanted a child.
I want you to tell me the truth.
About what?
"You, me, what happened in Berlin."
"I told you, we worked together."
Don't.
"The memories are fading, I can feel them disappearing."
I wanna know the truth while it still matters.
Please.
You were studying in Washington.
I was assigned to recruit you.
You seduced me.
It was part of the job.
Why me?
We knew you could help flip Kozlenko.
Who am I?
What is my name?
Kozlenko.
All I know is how to sit down and order a meal.
Not for you.
Just a place to hang.
The chef is great.
The shows are good.
There's a lot of whores coming in.
What do you want from me?
Tommy's a bad seed.
What am I supposed to do?
Shoot him?
That wouldn't be a bad idea.
I'm sorry I said that.
I didn't mean it.
It's just that he's scaring me.
please.
Know anything about the restaurant business?
He knows everything.
He's there day and night.
he could be a stool.
You want me to be your partner?
Is that what you're telling me?
please.
It's not even fair.
You don't understand.
You run the joint.
Maybe I'll try to help you.
Paulie.
You've always been fair with me.
he goes to Paulie.
he goes to Paulie.
Tommy hecallsPaulie.
But now he has to pay Paulie everyweekno matterwhat.
That's no question to ask a young girl!
What's Pepita the Elephant?
An elephant.
Right.
You're both nuts.
How old is she now?
Are you afraid she's yours?
-Is she?
She has no father.
Would you like some coffee?
-Yeah.
Give me your hand.
I'll read your palm.
You have a weird pulse.
It's like two parallel rhythms.
A steady Finnish hump.
And a fiery beat.
You're like Iceland:
"ice on the surface, fire inside."
You should show this fire to a red-haired woman.
She's been waiting for you for quite a while.
"Damn you, Jesse!"
Wrong hole.
The balcony will be out there!
Move it!
I'll come back tonight.
-It's a deal.
I'm no little girl although I like firefighters.
Fight fire with fire.
Ouch...
I don't think you're up to this.
I must fire you.
- Good.
I'll excuse myself.
"I'm gonna go to the ladies room and I'm going to remove my new, improved butt."
I would like you to order me a petite fillet and a wedge salad.
- And then we'll get to work.
- Will do.
Apology accepted.
- You must be Nora.
- Yes.
- Lawrence McGill.
- Very nice to meet you.
"Oh, my God, look at those earrings."
"Let me guess, a carat and a half?"
"Uh, yeah."
"Uh, are you a jeweler?"
No.
I make it my business to notice beautiful things.
Yes.
Please forgive me.
I'm a little nervous about all this.
- You're a virgin.
- Hardly.
I have five children.
I mean a dating service virgin.
"Oh, yeah."
"Well, yes."
I am.
Are you?
"Oh, no."
I'm an old whore at this point.
Lots of first dates.
"Seconds, not so much."
~ Um...
~ What?
Do you not think she has the right to know her husband was murdered?
No.
No-one has a right to know anything till I know who killed Mr Newcastle.
"We work for the dead, not the living."
Off you go.
Are you sure she can manage it?
She's never done it before.
Only one way to learn.
Are you ready?
"Is this your husband, Mrs Parker?"
"I-I-I mean, yes."
"It's Scott all right, but... just the shell of what he was."
What he used to be.
"(I'm sorry, Scottie.)"
~ All right.
~ Where did you find him?
"I, er..."
I don't have any details.
How did... he do it?
Do what?
Kill himself.
I'm afraid I don't know anything about his death.
"Don't know much for a copper, do you?"
Are you the tea lady?
When did you last see Scott?
Night before last.
Me birthday party.
Happy birthday.
~ Thanks.
~ Was it?
Then the sword might not even work.
"And if it doesn't, the guy's going to come looking for it."
We are in a race.
We're in a race.
You two have to find what happened to that tsuba and fast.
"Well, Artie, we're looking for a 500-year-old sword."
800.
Exactly.
So it should be easy.
You guys follow the tsuba.
I will follow--
Ah...the implosion grenade.
And one of us will find the thief.
W--wait.
"I mean, wh--wh--where are you going?"
Somebody is making new grenades.
Somebody who promised not to.
Again he doesn't answer.
And no good-bye.
This is impossible.
Keep at it though. you're the smart one.
- What are you doing?
- What?
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
You're--you're doing great.
- Hello.
"- Leena, hey."
"Hey, is--is Claudia there?"
"Okay, she won't be able to find it either."
Claudia's out.
It's just me.
- (HORN BLARES)
I am not having drinks with you.
You might be a pervert.
"I might be a pervert, but you're definitely a car thief."
I said I was sorry.
"- You didn't, actually."
- (SIREN WHOOPS)
- Oh.
- Damn it.
"That's why I said, ""Eyes on the road!"""
Screwdriver. (GRUNTS)
License and registration.
Hi!
"Terribly sorry, officer, but it's actually my car."
I'm trying to teach my girlfriend how to drive stick.
She's got a lot to learn.
I know.
"But, you know..."
Women.
"All right, I hear you."
It's a warning...this time.
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
What are you?
Some sort of misogynist?
You're welcome.
"Go, go, we got lucky."
We?
"- This isn't your car either, is it?"
- Hmm?
I stole a stolen car?
Now how about that drink?
You know it'll be three months until we get a spare part.
Make sure it doesn't happen again.
It won't.
Back to work!
I've got them very cheap.
Take a look at the large one.
- How much?
- 350 FM.
That's for women!
Try it on.
Too small for my girlfriend.
Look at him!
She's looking good.
How much for the trousers?
I'll give you 50 FM.
"No, 150!"
I can't give you more than 50... for that used rag.
I've made some progress with a serious man.
A rich man from Sarakollé.
He just needs to swallow the bait.
This has no future.
"She'll end up getting married, like our sisters."
Watch out!
The Director's coming.
You old whore!
Who did you date yesterday?
"In the afternoon, Seydow."
The ugly one?
Is the Minister in?
I'm Makan's secretary.
Fatou!
The Director wants to see you... tomorrow at 4 pm.
Might be able to pick up his movements.
I've got a croupier to find.
(PANTING)
"You're a hard man to track down, JC."
I need your help with something.
"Get lost, Harry, this is my downtime."
(yells) What the hell are you doing?
Did I not tell you?
I'm your new personal trainer.
- Please!
- Ah-ah!
The tall guy the other night in the casino.
The one that got chucked out.
What's his name?
"- You can't do this, Harry."
- This is just the warm-up.
What's his name?
The one that was screaming for Freddie Lau?
Alright.
Alright.
Stop.
His name's Kevin Grey.
He used to be on the staff.
He got chucked off a couple of months ago.
- Why?
- I don't know.
"It's OK, I've got my badges."
Why?
"Look, all's I know is that..."
is that there was a girl between them.
Some stripper who worked in Soho.
Freddie Lau stole her from Grey and Grey went mental.
"Night, hon."
Sorry!
- Trauma.
"- No problem, I just have to hurry."
How come?
- Don't get upset.
- Why would I be upset?
I need to clean for...
Sandy?
There's a real estate agent coming by first thing in the morning.
I need more milk.
A...
A real estate...
"OK, I give."
Why?
I was going to tell you on the way home.
To value the townhouse.
Value?
I just want to see how much it's worth.
- I know what value means.
"- I'm not selling, it would just be good to know in case."
- You're going to be in Dallas...
- I told you I'd pay my share!
- It's too big for me and Maya.
- It's only a contract!
You don't know that!
And it might be nice to be close to Mom.
Mom?
"Yeah, in case I need help."
"Sandy, Mom dropped Maya on her head."
It was an accident.
"Mel, you can't just go and make changes like this..."
What happened to your head?
"Uh, the sky is falling."
Do you have a pair of dress pants or a skirt or something I could borrow?
"Thank you, Lee."
Whatever.
"Hey, you know in that Cat Lady sketch?"
Do I have to hold a real cat?
Cat Lady sketch?
That thing's gonna get cut.
"Oh, good."
Who's that?
That is the new network dude.
"Mmm, yummers."
He reminds me of Scotty on General Hospital.
What?
"No, ew, Jenna."
Do not like that man.
That is a bad man.
"God, you have a gift."
Laura Bush is your size.
"Hi, uh, what are you doing down here?"
I'm known for being hands-on.
Clearly.
"That's how you should dress for work, by the way."
"Yeah, if I was president of the Philippines."
Afghanistan is a different situation...
I'll have an apple juice.
"Oh, we don't have apple juice, sir."
Then I'll take a vodka and tonic.
"Hi, I'm Liz Lemon."
I know who you are.
I thought there was a...
Whatever you said just now.
You continue the tale.
"Do it, sister."
Remember anything?
"Whatever it is bit, or scene let it be anything."
A villain entered the scene then.
Who is he?
- How will he be?
- He's...
- Come out.
- He stole my bike.
He's short...
What's his name?
Bald head...
Halwa...where are you going?
My back is punctured.
But you're not like Halwa.
Isn't it?
He's just like you.
Where's my bike?
Where's my bike?
Stop...stop...
Where's my bike?
To whom did you sell it?
"You come aside, I'll tell you."
How could you love such a man?
I don't know.
"I'm angry on him, I hate him...but..."
Whatever he said was fresh and new.
I liked his kick.
Did we love so much?
It's good.
"Brevity, the soul of wit."
But he was a writer.
Look at all these letters.
"No, there's something weird about this."
"Monk, look around you."
That note's probably the least weird thing in the whole apartment.
This is the birthplace of weird.
But why today?
This guy was a lottery nut.
Isn't tomorrow night the big jackpot?
Yeah.
"Yeah, he probably knew he'd never win, which makes him a whole lot smarter than me."
What do you got?
Contact lens case.
With only one lens.
Fluid!
It's fluid!
I need a wipe.
I don't have a wipe.
G-give me a wipe.
Just I need a wipe.
Where's Natalie?
I'm your biggest fan.
I never Miss a show.
Thank you.
That means a lot.
"Natalie, what's your favorite number?"
"My gosh, there's so many."
- Mine's 19.
- That's a good one.
Do you think it's gonna come up on the show tomorrow?
"I'm sorry, Mr. Monk."
Are you parents divorced?
My mom is dead
My mom and dad are getting a divorce.
What happened there...?
Just some kids.
At school.
Where do you go to school anyway?
"I never see you.... ...Owen, listen."
...What...?
You have to hit back.
You have to hit back hard.
I can't ...There are three
Then you hit back even harder.
Hit them harder than you dare And then they'll stop.
...What if they hit me back?
You have a knife.
Yeah...
But what if that didn't stop them?
I'll help you.
But..
You're a girl...
I'm a lot stronger than you think I am
...I have to get in there...!
...Move Move...
- Mr. Zoric...?
"- Yes, Owen?"
I was wondering.
About the after school strength training?
Can people still sign up?
...You like to get strong?
Okay.
Four o'clock.
"Please God, don't."
Don't fucking take me out.
Please don't.
Please don't take me out.
-It's okay.
-Please don't.
I'm not feeling that.
What's up with the gallop?
The tempo's shit.
-I'm right.
Right?
"-Yep, tempo's shit."
"No, no, no, no."
Let us get into it.
It's gonna have texture.
"Like, you know, like ooze."
Sonic ooze.
Great.
Sonic ooze.
"Okay, baby, how about a horn section?"
"A little Tijuana Brass, maybe?"
I heard Herb's in town.
-Let's not get patronizing.
-That's not patronizing.
That was accommodating.
I was accommodating you.
"Against my better judgment, even."
"-Sweet, that's it."
That's the direction.
-I've overplayed it.
No.
We just gotta straighten out the beat.
It's not just a game.
Not to me.
I can see that.
"Where were you a week ago, Monday, sir?"
"A week ago, Monday."
"That would be 4, 7, 23, 35, 44, 53."
"Uh, excuse me?"
I was here.
Like always.
Watching a drawing.
Three prime numbers!
I did not see that one coming.
"Do you own a pair of scissors, Mr. O'Dwyer?"
Of course I do.
Who doesn't?
"May I see them, please?"
How about some metallic paint?
Paint?
"Yeah, a shade called titanium black."
Do you think I killed Marissa Kessler?
"Well, you do have her picture up all over the wall."
I've got everybody's picture up on the wall.
"I mean, these are the past lotto girls."
Jackpot winners.
People who work there.
Secretaries.
Gaffers.
They all know me.
I'm a freelance journalist.
I publish a newsletter.
A lotto bulletin.
"Yeah, I've seen that."
What are we going to do with everyone ?
People are scared.
They'll get hungry.
And what about looters ?
We just have to get organized.
"Also, keep the radio on and gather up anything you think might be useful... flashlights, blankets, water, batteries, you'll be fine."
I can't get through to either of the boys.
"Well, keep trying."
How about you ?
We should get you to the hospital.
"I'm fine, it's just a bump on the head."
Mine.
Not his or hers.
Hello.
"Ryan, where are you ?"
They're at the Cooper house with Taylor.
Tell him to stay there.
Okay.
"Just stay there, okay."
All right.
Seth ?
"Hey, Dad."
"Yeah, yeah, we're okay."
I wish I could say the same for Ryan's car though.
How's Mom ?
Mm-hmm.
And Ryan ?
Ryan and Taylor are at your house.
"Yeah, sounds good, we'll do that."
"All right, take care."
Found a flashlight.
I can see that.
- Yeah.
"No, you don't."
'Cause I just made it up.
"Don't you want a warm, wet jimmy ha-ha?"
No.
You live there?
Cool.
I'm gonna live in an apartment.
"Next year, maybe."
"- Yeah, right."
- I am.
"My sister's gonna get a loft apartment, and she said I could live with her."
She won't even letyou sit in her car.
- Can we come in?
"- Yeah, can we come in?"
We'll be good.
"Go eat it outside, Robby."
Okay!
I just need to put on my jacket.
- Can we see your parents' room?
- My parents are separated.
My dad sleeps there.
"He'll be home, like, any second."
"We're each going to do it, and you have to tell us what the difference is."
"Like, how it feels different when she does it from when I do it."
Exactly.
"Thank you, Rebecca."
"You're welcome, Heather."
- But first we need a towel and-
- And a washcloth.
Right.
A wet washcloth and a dry washcloth.
- Do you have many rooms?
"- Yeah, we do."
Do you need one?
"- Yes, maybe."
- We have many.
"I'll think about it, and come back later."
Let's go.
I'm going back to Seoul.
You are?
Why?
It's too quiet here.
Don't think I'll be able to write in this lonely place.
Makes sense.
"Okay, let's go together."
"Yeah, let's."
Hwasung Rest Area
- Do you want some coffee?
- Sure.
Over there.
- Hello.
"- Potatoes, large size, please."
"It's 2,400 Won, sir."
Director Kim.
You know I once lost my father in a rest area like this.
You did?
There was this little stream behind a building like this one.
"I was there, but no one knew."
They went crazy searching for me.
My dad really scolded me for that one.
Let's see each other in Seoul.
Don't strain yourself for me.
"No, don't say that."
Brought you something.
- Is it chocolate?
- No.
"Oh, wait... it is chocolate."
How's she doing?
"Couple more hours, and she should be out of the woods."
Mel...
I don't think you should come to Dallas.
I said I was scared.
I didn't say I didn't want to go.
"I know, but..."
You're getting cold feet.
- No my feet are fine...
- Liar.
I think you're going for the wrong reason.
Is this your thing?
Thrill of the chase and then lose interest?
I'm the bad boyfriend you want to make happy.
"- Peter, what the hell?"
- And you don't even know it.
- I'm going to Dallas.
- I don't think you should.
Tough!
"You made your bed, you're gonna sleep in it... with me."
I saw you kissing Jerry.
- That wasn't...
I wasn't kissing...
- Looked like you were.
He was kissing me.
- I actually came up here to see a patient.
- The jackass?
- Don't...
Two more.
Do not waver.
You'll leave?
Yes.
I'll leave you alone.
Who said I'd let you leave?
Then let me ask you one thing.
What?
Why in God's name is he doing this?
Because her father has sinned.
What sin?
What sin did I commit?
Her father suspected another.
"He tried to kill him, and finally succeeded."
But my daughter...!
My daughter...
My daughter got sick first!
How can that...
How can that possibly...
"One more, now."
How can that be...?
Don't do it.
What are you saying?
Whether you walk out of here or not is completely up to you.
Touch me and see.
"A ghost does not have flesh and bones, and you see I have both."
Park Chun-bae
No.
That's not it.
It's you.
No.
This is all your doing.
"Excuse me, sweetheart."
So here you two are!
You're my friend.
You saved my life.
You get to wear my crown.
You are my friend
I'll be forever loyal
And you are my destiny
Franzie... dear Franzie.
"What is it, snookums?"
I can't make heads or tails of this stuff.
"Franz, how about we get away from this place?"
Why?
I've got money I can lend you.
Why?
Things are fine here.
You sent all the guys off.
Now we're short tonight.
We've got a first-class replacement.
Who?
I see.
Mr. Peep Peep.
A most respectable man... who'll soon be chirping a different tune.
Let's move out to the suburbs.
Come in.
"Miss Cilly, there's a man here to see you."
I just look at tax forms and I'm lost.
Reinhold says to tell you we need ―
You know.
He wants Franz to stop by.
Well?
Reinhold sent word to go see him.
Robbie.
Ease off.
You started this dance.
"He was stupid, you were stupid."
"Come on, let's just forget it and get out of here."
Come on.
"Thanks, Sonny."
"Forget it, man."
That's what I'm here for.
"Hey, I don't want to see you guys in here again."
"Yeah, we love you, too."
"Forget it, Annie."
You don't wanna be in the music business.
It's a jungle.
Exotic dancing ain't exactly the United Nations.
Neither is stripping.
I got a great set of pipes.
"Really, I do."
I agree.
But can you carry a tune?
"# Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz?"
#
# My friends all have Porsches #
# I must make amends ##
"I need a singer, not a stripper."
I'll have my agent call you.
Sometimes it helps them if you pat them on the fanny.
"Oh, yeah?"
Thanks.
You got a baby?
"Well, in a manner of speaking."
His name's Noogie and I'm married to him.
We were playing!
I don't care.
Dad lets us play.
I don't care what your dad does.
This is important.
I want you to look at me.
- So start already.
- Excuse me?
Nothing.
The doctor said I need rest.
And I expect your support.
There'll be some new rules.
I want absolute quiet in the house.
I have to sleep.
"If it's important, knock."
And no visitors.
"If anyone asks,"
Mom is ill.
We'll keep the blinds closed.
I have to avoid sunlight.
"You'll play only in the garden, quietly."
Bring nothing inside.
"No branches, no animals..."
What are you doing?
We'll start over.
Right?
We need to hold this family together.
One from me and one from Lukas.
Very nice.
I'm serious about what I just said.
"We won't forget, right?"
Good.
-Can I turn on the light?
-No.
I put it in here to keep it fresh.
Can we leave this open to get some light?
This is our baby's birthday cake.
I don't want any.
Suit yourself.
It's good.
You should try some.
Today's his birthday?
No.
It was in September.
I missed it.
I left him with Mama before he was two years old.
That means I've missed four birthdays so we celebrated all four of them last night.
Does your mama know about....
Know what?
"No, I never told her."
"I never meant you any trouble, Dale."
I still don't.
Wouldn't Bonnie be surprised to know she had a half-brother in Nigger Town?
You should have some of our baby's cake--
Quit calling him that.
Why?
That's what he is.
"Damn it, I told you I didn't want any."
-Do you want this?
-What are you doing?
-This is what you want.
-Cut it out.
"Cut it out, goddamn it!"
Why did you ever fuck with me?
Ted Carter?
- No.
"- Don't you lie to me, don't lie!"
I'm not lying to you.
"Doc, help me."
I need your help.
"What do you mean by ""help""?"
I don't want to have the baby.
Give me something.
There's nothing I can give you.
Tell me who's responsible.
I can help you that way.
You can get married.
He's already married.
Then he'll have to take care of you and provide for the baby.
Who is it?
- Please just give me something!
- Selena!
"I've done a lot of things, but I've never broken a law."
What you're asking me to do is break the law of man and God.
"Now, tell me, who is the man?"
"Selena, tell me who he is."
Who is he?
It's my stepfather!
It's my stepfather!
It's Lucas!
"Hi, doc, come on in, have a drink."
I've got Selena in my office.
Selena?
What for?
She's pregnant.
I told her she'd get in trouble.
If I told them everything they'd never let me go out.
Baby... come on.
"Simon, we've got to talk."
"Simon, look at me!"
- You are always watching porn.
"- Just go, OK?"
It was only porn.
It didn't mean anything.
I did it for us.
You are dead to me.
- You look like a worn-out corn hole.
- Simon just dumped me.
- You were hooked on each other.
- It was the porn mag.
He's always jerking off to porn.
Men can be real creeps.
"Take this, baby."
- What is it?
- X.
- I can't swallow pills.
- You can't use that for diddly shit.
Now swallow.
"That wasn't so bad, was it?"
"Come on, they're playing our song."
Whoever finishes first wins the pile.
"- That's a lot of coke, Marc."
- A gram each.
That's nothing.
- On the count of three.
"- I'II wipe you out, faggot!"
- You're history.
"- Three, two, one, GO!"
- Jean-Claude?
- What?
I don't have a hard-on!
So what?
Me neither.
In whose honor should we get it up?
I always wake up with one.
You're probably too filthy...
There's so much dirt id take a bulldozer to dig it out.
Come on.
It feels great...
I can't.
I'll start bleeding again.
"Well, how about your feet?"
We could clean them up a bit.
Purify the air...
You'll be all right...
Stop worrying.
Is all in your head and you're getting obsessed...
"Feels good, huh?"
Feel any lighter?
You're real pretty!
You're almost desirable...
Hands off!
What hands?
"Yours, faggot!"
Don't be ashamed...
I'm not ashamed.
I just don't want to.
I don't want to...
How do you know?
If you've never tried it?
"- I have not been a good person, mama."
"I put everything in my life before you,"
"Before my daughter, before the man that i love..."
My husband.
"Yes, well, we can just put god's will back in our lives."
"I've lost everything, mama..."
Everything.
"But like saul, you can get it back."
"Mom, i just..."
I think it's too late.
- No.
"No, it's never too late."
"- Yes, i don't think..."
"- Yes, it is."
"- You'll see, regina."
It's never too late.
"- I'm right here, mama."
- Oh my god!
- See?
See?
- Oh my baby!
- Oh my baby.
"- I'm so sorry, mama."
"Oh marcus, look at our baby."
Look at you.
"Oh, sweetheart, will you ever forgive me?"
- Please?
"- No, mama, you were forgiven"
The minute i walked in the house.
It's me who you need to forgive
For doing all those things to you.
And then after that we can go swing and go to the park.
"I'll take you to a movie, ok?"
"Oh, I love you."
"I love you, rags."
"We'll have a good day, huh?"
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
Mr. Dennings?
"Well, you know, it's ok."
"Well, thank you very much, but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?"
You like him.
"Yeah, I like him."
Don't you like him?
"Hey, what's going on?"
"What is this, huh?"
"You're going to marry him, aren't you?"
"Oh, God, are you kidding?"
Me marry Burke Dennings?
Don't be silly.
Of course not.
Where did you get that idea?
But you like him.
Of course.
"I like pizzas, too, but I'm not going to marry one."
You don't like him like daddy?
"Regan, I love your daddy."
"I'll always love your daddy, honey."
Burke just comes around here a lot because...
"Well, he's lonely."
Don't got nothin' to do.
"Well, I heard..."
Differently.
"Oh, you did?"
What did you hear?
-Then talk to him.
-I don't know.
"It's worth finding out, if you like her."
"I do, so much."
I can't stop thinking about her.
I can't sleep..
You know what?
You have to go for it.
How often does this happen to you?
You owe it to yourself.
Here's your warm milk.
I'm gonna put the bourbon in it at home.
"Anyway, seriously, just talk to the guy, okay?"
Let me know how it goes.
It's Rachel.
You're having a baby and you need to prepare.
You're gonna make yourself watch the whole thing.
Just do it!
I came to the big city to become a star.
-I'll do anything to make that happen.
-Anything?
Maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.
I wonder which one of these guys becomes the father.
"No, no."
Can't get pregnant that way.
-Oh!
"Hey, Rach!"
-Hi.
-Happy Valentine's Day!
-You too!
How's living at Ross'?
Stop calling here or I'm calling the police.
"Oh, my God."
Who was that?
No one.
Noannie.
"It's just some idiots calling saying stupid things, okay?"
Like what?
"Brian, it's stupid."
"Like what, Noannie?"
He says he hears I put out to white boys.
"He calls here again, you give the phone to me."
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?
Yeah.
"This is all my fault, isn't it?"
No.
"No, don't you ever say that."
"Noannie, look."
"Look, this has nothing to do with you."
Come here.
Come here.
"I know, I know, I slept with my paralyzed boyfriend's best friend."
It's the worst thing I've ever done.
It would be great if you said something.
"Sorry, I'm just thinking how hard that must have been for you to tell me."
And I'm really glad that you did.
I just want us to be honest with each other.
Do you still have feelings for him?
Nope.
No.
No.
Okay.
I knew you fucking looked at me funny.
(sighs)
Liar.
I should have listened to myself.
-Where are you going?
-Nowhere!
Where am I gonna go?
-l'm stuck here with you.
-Yeah.
"And what have you got, huh?"
What have you got outside of this?
Do you have a life?
-How could that possibly matter?
"-What do you mean ""how does it matter""?"
-lt means everything.
-What is...
What have you got?
You've got nothing to live for except for this!
-Mmm-hmm...
-This is all you've got.
You've got your protocol.
You've got your numbers.
You're on the other side of the fucking numbers.
And you read them and you take their money.
"You think you're not a part of this, huh?"
Do you think you can fuck around with these people?
What's wrong with you?
What are you doing here?
You're in it.
You asked for it and you're in it.
"Here, locked and loaded."
-Safety's off. lt's good to go.
TERRY:
Greg.
(CLEARS THROAT)
(CLEARS THROAT)
"What's up, chief?"
"What's up, chief?"
How long have we been mates?
How long have we been mates?
"Well, I don't know."
"Back in stir, '74?"
"Well, I don't know."
"Back in stir, '74?"
"What have I done, Greg?"
"What have I done, Greg?"
Why don't you love me anymore?
Why don't you love me anymore?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
I know about Bangkok.
Setting up your own supply.
I know about Bangkok.
Setting up your own supply.
"Look, Terry..."
"Look, Terry..."
"Why would you do that - go behind my back, betray me?"
"Why would you do that - go behind my back, betray me?"
I just thought that...
I know what you thought.
I just thought that...
I know what you thought.
You thought you'd steal my customers.
You thought you'd steal my customers.
I know we're late.
"We're on our way,"
"I don't know what's going on, I can't get a cab."
"Okay, we're on our way, I'm sorry."
Bye.
"In my wallet there's a secret number for a taxi,"
I always get one through them.
Don't forget the text.
And take my binder from the desk.
"Too tight, too tight."
You're pulling it too hard.
Do it yourself.
Goni.
Gonki.
Help me.
"It's my fault, I'm sorry."
Is everyone here?
Of course.
Shall we go in?
"- Yes, we're anxious to continue, sir."
Want to get together after rehearsal?
I don't think so.
How about this weekend?
"I can't, I'm working."
I'm busy with my father.
I'm sorry if I offended you yesterday.
Forget it.
Walk gracefully.
It's Europe.
"Not here, not Tel Aviv."
"Not coarse, not hot."
Graceful.
What's that behind you?
Turn round...
"To the left, the one you touched."
Careful you don't break it.
Try to free it.
Pull it out.
Toss it up to me.
He was tall!
It's your size.
is it the left leg or the right?
It's a leg bone. lt's not a shoe.
"Are you well, Mrs Godarzi?"
"Thank you, you're very kind... lt's very difficult reaching you."
"It was the same in Tehran, always engaged."
Yes...
We're ready.
"Yes, they're ready too..."
Everyone's ready.
"Yes, if you don't mind, when you call, you have to wait a few minutes until I drive up to higher ground."
"Yes, that very place."
"Yes, yes."
All right.
Don't mention it...
Thank you...
Good-bye.
Behzad...
Hello.
Are you well?
- Why are you here?
- l've come to see you.
How did you know I was here?
"When I brought the bread, I asked Mim Kharaman,"
- Of course you will.
- Adam's a pro...
- Of course.
All adults.
"- And, uh, we're all adults here."
Let's play some video games.
I hate this stupid game.
Shoot!
The game hates you.
Next victim?
Who's up for it?
"I am, if that's cool."
"Yeah, it's, uh, it's cool."
"- Oh, just gonna--"
- I'm gonna go with you.
- I'm gonna get the potato salad.
- Would you go...
"Oh, I'll go with you."
I'll go someplace else.
I didn't know you could drift in this game.
It takes practice.
"You brake, accelerate, and then you move the wheel like this."
Watch it.
Sorry.
I didn't mean...
Bri--Brian.
"Adam, come on."
We cool?
"Everybody's cool now, right?"
Good morning.
"Yeah, but we definitely want something back before 10:00, okay, so would you..."
"Hey, everybody, look who's back, huh?"
You have to see the view.
Join this road.
"Gentlemen, this is our research department."
We are proud of what we gained through research.
"Yes, here is Frederik Jackman and Tonje Sandvik."
Tonje Sandvik our research leader.
Is that you?
Aksel god.
Do you know me again?
-Yes.
Of course.
-Here's Report.
-It's Not necessary.
But it is the latest version.
"We have what we need, thanks."
Shall we proceed?
-Yes.
OK.
"Thus, it is so ..."
It's so disrespectful.
"Yes, it must have been a shock."
Where is Lars?
I need to call him.
"No, wait a minute."
"Eva, listen to me."
PWG is the only card we have.
"In a few days the deal is done, and so you'll never have to see him again."
-What do you mean?
-Drag Back.
Hear what they have to say
He will not getting buy a single share.
-So You'd rather go bankrupt?
'Cause there's a jungle out there
It's a jungle out there
There's something wrong here.
This is wrong.
This is very wrong.
"This is very, very..."
Wrong?
This was no random mugging.
This was all about her.
He was after her.
He took her purse and some jewelry.
He wanted us to think robbery.
She was stabbed six times.
That's right.
Two in the neck.
Four in the back.
"Or, was stabbed three times."
Look at the pattern.
"It's two, two and two."
Three times.
With a pair of scissors.
Yes.
That's possible.
Who brings scissors to a mugging?
Scissors say what?
Spur of the moment.
Not planned.
Plus the mud on her shoes.
There's a mud puddle near the exit.
But there's a light right there.
"If she was walking, she would have seen that."
"So, she was running when she left the building."
- There is something decadent.
- Only in the entire universe ...
It is cool the actors Simon.
You will have you.
- It's great what he says.
I want the book.
- Leave me.
- She has had?
- Who was I?
- Who you had?
- Tu.
I love you.
"You know, I love you."
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
Maybe you should remove trousers if you have the Holy Spirit.
You want to do?
Why?
Why are usually them that they do it to me.
I can also legarti feet.
"For the same reason, usually because ... to me that is doing this."
And this why?
Because usually Am I that are ridiculous.
So we can forget.
The return when I want.
Do not go!
"No, I must follow!"
You need to do evil to survive?
- Even a child?
"- Not a child, it's worse."
Uneventful.
I heard that Hybra Tech is sponsoring one of the monster trucks for the big rally next week.
Really?
I didn't know that.
I was wondering if you can score some tickets for me and Zeke?
Or not.
Becky!
Hi Julian!
Look out!
"Beck, are you alright?"
"Grap my bag, I'll get your bike."
How many bikes is it this month?

Hi Becky.
How are you doing?
"Oh, I am doing fine."
How are you?
Hi Guys!
Hi Katie.
Hi Baby.
What's wrong?
No kiss for the former-boyfriend?
You smell like farm wather.

No.
Hi Guys!
Are you going to check out my gymnastics today?
"Oh yeah, bet you look real good bent over the bar."

You wait and see!
Julie!

"- Yes, you won tonight, Bill!"
We both won tonight!
We both won tonight!

"Yes, this is my town."
It's not new to you.
"You've read books about it, you've seen movies."
People are always talking about New York.
"It's the most exciting city in the world, they say, the most glamorous, the most frightening, and above all, the fastest."
How old is he?
I'd say about your age.
My age?
Sit down.
But you don't understand...
Sit down!
I'm telling you all this in confidence.
He's the only hope we have of catching the killer.
The man we're after is after Hoolick.
He's after Hoolick.
"When he strikes, we'll catch him."
But we need someone to keep an eye on Wilbur every minute.
Do you mind if I tell my girl about this?
You're to tell no one.
Wilbur's life is at stake.
It's more at stake than you think.
I knew we could count on you.
We'll keep in touch with you.
Good day.
Good day.
My age?
"Hello, Mr. Miles."
Not now!

"Oh, hello, Uncle Bob."
Did you see those men?
I saw them.
Wilbur.

"When you were on the train, did you spend the whole night in Nancy's drawing room?"
Aunt Nancy's drawing room.
"I guess that would've been structural letdown, huh?"
You know this place?
Yeah. it's a fleabag hotel.
"They say that Bret Easton Ellis, he got drunk... and he threw up in a flag tree."
The thing won't stop growing.

Thanks.

- Thank you for your help.
Walt.
We're not done yet.
We gotta find Alex.
My whole first chapter hangs on that.
Go home and use your imagination for chapter one.
Hi.
Last time I was here I stayed in room 323.
Kind of a good luck thing.
It's available?
Nope.
But I got 305 across the hall.
That's fine.
Sign.
"Good evening, Mr. Dzasokhov."
"You're a very pretty girl, Alex."
You know that?
Thank you.
Will you do me a favor?
The band is too loud.
It's a birthday party.
- So let's try the other.
- That's where it has to be.
- Are you getting tired?
- No.
- All right.
[Rachel] I'm gonna start to scream soon.
I'm gonna go out and throw myself under a car.
That's the only thing I can do.
He was waiting for the doctor's call when I left.
What kind of a mother am I?
What kind of a mother am I?
I don't know where he is.
He might even be in a hospital.
I don't know.
I'm gonna start to scream at the top of my voice.
I don't care if they put me in jail.
I have to find my Freddy!
I want my Freddy!
Fred Baker.
My only child.
I'm gonna break everything.
I

I will break everything here.
Everything.
"Fred Baker, where are you?"
Where are you?

"Fred Baker, where are you?"
Where are you?
[Ida] It was hanging up from the ceiling.
"He must be one of those there, on the wall."
"Fido, come here!"
You guys are crazy!
What do you think you're doing?
- The swine!
- Are you all right?
You picked the wrong guy!
Here's your hat.
Did they hurt you?
They picked the wrong guy.
"What's going on, Officer?"
What's happening?
So you don't know either?
He's playing dumb.
What do you want?
Franz is ―
He's in there dancing with some fat cow.
Violets.
"Here, Cilly."
I shouldn't really accept these.
How much longer will it be?
You two gonna become trash pickers?
Break every bone in his body ― he won't change.
But you're a clever girl.
"Listen, I'll get you ten other guys."
"I need him, and he'll do as I say!"
Forget about Franz!
"You love him, huh?"
Won't help me out?
- No.
- Say that again!
Let me go!
You don't like me anymore anyway.
Unless Venice has been overrun by the French.
No flag.
No signal.
Why not?
She must see our colours.
She must've heard us clear for action.
"Mr. Ponsonby, private night signal."
Hoist the night signal.
- No reply.
"- The gun ports are open, sir."
We can't wait for her broadside.
"I'm just as suspicious as you, but we must be sure."
We can't expose the ship like this.
We must fire now!
- All right.
Run out your guns.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
But hold your fire!
Run out your guns!
Heave!
What ship are you?
We are His Majesty's ship Defiant.
What ship are you?
Fire party to number five gun!
Mr. Ponsonby!
It's his arm.
Get him below.
"Hudson, King!"
Get the captain below!
The captain's been hit!
Take your orders from me!
Ready!
It's OK.
I was too drunk to worry about it.
But really.
What were the odds I'd be scooped up by that other removal guy?
I couldn't take a step without being reminded of Johan.
"- So, what's up?"
"- Yeah, what's up?"
"Well, let me think."
Just screw the brain out of me.
"So, you really moved my stuff?"
(cell phone rings)
"Yeah, two hours or something."
I just need to move this piano.
"See you, honey."
Yeah?
Yes...
"Yeah, OK."
- What are you doing?
"- Hey, OK..."
- You're sick.
Sick!
"- Hey, sorry, OK?"
(slow jazz)
"I know this is awkward, but I'm just back from Paris and I..."
I just thought...
Can I come in?
"No, this is a bad idea."
I really feel bad.
"You were so good to me, and I just didn't..."
"I know I've completely screwed up, but if you'll forgive me..."
"Anna, please don't!"
I don't blame you for not daring.
No.
But I bet you do.
Mm-hmm.
"I bet you have a big, thick pair of bifocals."
"She doesn't have daddy issues, she has granddaddy issues."
I'm ending it.
"Ted, I beg of you, don't quit on a body that won't quit."
"Ooh, ooh, that'll go sweet on a bumper sticker."
That's going in the journal.
"Wait, did you steal my dream journal?"
No!
"Now, get back in there before all your teeth fall out and you're naked in front of Shaker Heights High School in a play you never rehearsed for."
Bastard!
We don't connect on a single thing.
It's over.
It's not...
"Look, Carly, I got to tell you something."
"I just, I don't see a future here."
"Oh, my God."
Are you dying?
"Oh, that is so hot."
Hey... is that R2-D2?
Do you like Star Wars?
I love Star Wars.
"Me, too!"

"I mean, I've only seen the new ones."
Close enough.
So?
Yeah.
I knew it!
I could feel it.
Should I throw in two wreaths and wait for the Père Lachaise to open?
Coming?
Just a sec.
Time enough to waste this jerk first.
- Are you retarded or what?
- He touched Martine.
This rat is jinxed!
Here they come!
"I'm warning you, lying is my speciality."
You're not what's lying.
- What is?
- Poverty!
"If one lies, it's to get... one shouldn't ever get!"
"Here, it's okay."
"Jeez, my clog!"
We can't stay here!

No one who saw something like that.
Everything we do.
Who are we doing it?
This is fun ... friends.
We will not play.
"Addons If you are in doubt, Prizes will be lost."
"Oh, jeez, we gotta find out who she is."
"If this guy's feeling cornered, all bets are off."
Tonight's his last chance to get revenge on anyone who's ever wronged him.
She's most likely his next target.

"Garcia, we're gonna send you some photographs."
- What do you want me to do with them?

See if you can find anything that tells us who this girl is.
I'll hit you back.

And she's not looking for you?
You two have incredibly think faces.
Don't you ever mess with my sister again.
I saw Migs yesterday.
He even asked how you're doing.
What did you say?
.
Of course I nagged him!
Oh my!
He was even with that Bela!
After what he did to you?
.
I can't believe his guts!
"Sis, what I did was right, wasn't it?"
"Sis, is it really like that when you're pregnant?"
You're not just craving for the food.
You're also craving for the place where you want to eat!
My gosh.
"And you know, this place is too far!"
Even taxis can't get here anymore.
You'll find Mrs. Karras in the last bed on the left-hand side.

Go get someone else.
Don't bother the father.
Go to your bed.
Go to your bed.

Why?
"Come on, I'm gonna take you out of here, Mama."
I'm gonna take you home.
"I'll get you out of here tonight, Mama."
"Mama, everything's gonna be all right."
"Mama, I'm gonna take you home."
"Mama, I'm gonna take you home."
-Couldn't you have put her someplace else?
-Like what?
Private hospital?
"Who got the money for that, Dimmy?"
You?
There seems to be an alien pubic hair in my drink.
-I beg your pardon?
-Never seen it before in my life.
Have you?
We're pretty comfortable up there compared to the Gemini and Mercury programs.
I simply don't know what to do!
Yeah.

Are you okay?
I'm in bed with the girl of my dreams.
Why wouldn't I be okay?
I'm so glad we talked yesterday.
"I was really overwhelmed and ready to bolt, and you were just so cool and understanding."
I don't want to make the same mistakes I made last time.
You know...
"I think that I am going to have to write,like, a couple million songs about you."
"Oh,yeah?"
Is that okay?
"Or do you need me to,like,taper back?"
Let me think about it.
don't you?
Frabjous Day.
How could I forget?
Wish I'd wake up.
do you?
N-Of course.
This has all come from my own mind.
Which would mean that I'm not real.
Afraid so.NYou're just a figment of my imagination.
I would dream up someoneNwho's half-mad.
yes.
But you would have to beNhalf-mad to dream me up.
(LAUGHS ) then.
I'll miss you when I wake up.

That would be I.
You have very poor evaporating skills.Nl should be the one.

"- No, I'm not..."
I'm not pregnant.
"What happens, Martha, if you have a child out of wedlock?"
You'd better do something.
You'd better pop a question today.
"Would you just pull over, Meemaw, and let Martha..."
"- Martha, would you drive?"
"- No, no, no."
We're on vacation.
Your mom's out of town.
She left me in charge for once.
"No, she left me in charge, by the way, Meemaw."
"Wait, where are you going?"
"Um, just making a stop."
"Well, you have an appointment."

He's accused of raping Alicia.
What are you talking about?
Try to help him.
The poor guy's got nobody.
Have you been to see him?
Me?
"After what he's done, I can't."
But he needs help and you're his friend.
All right.
What jail is he in?
It's in Segovia.
"Wait here for me, please."
Hello.
Hello.
I'd like to see an inmate.
"That's in Visitations, through that door to the left."
Thank you.
May I help you?
I'd like to see the inmate Benigno Martin.
"This isn't a visitor's day, but let me see."
"I'm sorry, I can't hear you."
I'm sorry.
This isn't a visitor's day.
"and what's more, the intern hasn't requested a visit."
He doesn't know I'm in Madrid.
I arrived yesterday.
Are you a relative?
"No, I'm a friend."
My name is Marco Zuloaga.
"May I see your ID, please?"
"Yes, of course."
Can I phone him?
I see a light.
- You're not dying.
It's just your ankle.
"Oh, God!"
- You're supposed to help me!
- Watch where you're going!
- You ran into me!
- Haleh?
Where's the trauma?
"Throw a rock, honey."
Blunt chest in 2.
"You look wonderful, by the way."
- Eighty-five pounds and counting.
- Good for you.
You cut your hair?
"- BP's falling, 70 systolic."
- Keep squeezing that bag.
- Where are we?
- Flail and crepitus.
Needs a tube.
- Who has an angio cath?
- Right here.
How can I help?
"Given there's only one, I don't see how you can."
- What is that?
What are you doing?
- It's a tube to help him breathe.
"He has a collapsed lung, this will re-inflate it."
I need a thoracostomy tray.
"All right, let's see how much air he's got in here."
"Oh, God!"
"That any better, Mr. Chambers?"
Likewise!
"Come on, boy!"
Come on!
Schnapps?
"Well, Sam, here's to your very good health."
- Skoal.
- Prosit.
"You know, that's a lot of money that fellow offered you for your dog."
Yeah?
That's a lot of dog too.
Ja!
"- Hey, boss, let's head for the hotel, huh?"
"- No, no, no, not yet."
Maybe somebody we know will show.
Ole!
Ha-ha!
How are you?
I got lots trouble.
"Nowhere I can get two dogs, cheap."
"What matter, huh?"
I got load of thousand-pound flour...
I got to get over to 40-Mile Creek.
"Two of my dogs, they die."
It's too big load for the other four dogs to pull.
"Quiet, now!"
Yo!
"That's one fine dog, mister!"
"You want to sell, maybe?"
"- No, I don't."
- I'll say he don't!
"You know, that fellow back there... just offered him 1,000 bucks."
- One thousand bucks?
Just put her in the oven!
"OK, a little privacy?"
Take a hike.
"Oh, oui."
"Oh, my gosh, I'm in love!"
You're like a cookie angel.
Wow!
"And you're hot, too!"
Hello?
I guess it didn't work.
Gingy.
Is it you?
The one I was made for?
We'll be together forever.
Sweet!
"Are you happy, Gingy?"
You bet!
The time since I met you has been the best...
seven and a half minutes of my life.
Good!
Because this is only the beginning.
"I'm going to love you and hold you, and feed you and dress you and cling to you and hang onto you and smother you with my love."
- Yeah.
- Forever and ever and ever and ever...
"You know, it's getting a little stuffy in here."
"You know, I'm gonna go get some air."
"- Oh, no, you don't."
"- Oh, no!"
Not without your umbrella.
Come on!
"Here, let me get that."
Wait for me.
Good to know.
- Where's Jackson?
- Change of shift.
"Come back for more, have you, tough guy?"
"Oh, you're looking a whole lot worse than I am."
Whatever.
Where are you going?
Tequila and tacos.
You want?
"Come back inside, we need to talk."
- I'm done talking.
- Let's head inside.
"Ah, shit."
Seriously?
Okay.
I get it.
"Jackson's hatchet, man."
Come on.
"Here I am, do it."
"Go back inside the house,"
"I'll grab my service weapon, tell Jackson I made a move on you."
He doesn't have to know.
"I'll take it from here, Agent Briggs."
Let's take a drive.
She's beautiful.
"I envy you, your emotional responses to things, I..."
I train myself out of it.
But there has been a cost.
"Well, maybe you should stop with the daddy routine."
Let people figure it out themselves.
"You're right, Flynn."
I can't fix you.
"- Okay, well, you don't know."
Obviously you're not fans.
You're heating on me 'cause I'm supposedly not a fan.
"Not happening, chicken banger."
"Okay, I'm just going for the book, so."
"Yeah, around here, after 7:30, it's Alice in Chains or nothin'."
"Oh, now, now."
"What's your name, bud?"
"Hey, I'm Blake."
"I'm a hard rocker too, so I get it."
"And I'm married, butt pirate."
Hey.
"Hang on, buddy."
"We're all friends, here."
No need for the name calling.
"- Fuck off, Eddie Bauer!"
- You know what?
- Whoa.
- I've got this.
You can't talk to my friends that way.
- Is that a fact?
- Yeah.
I bet I can pour this beer on your head...
Like that.
Oh!
"Hey, come on, that's a..."
That's a perfectly good Molson.
"Hey, shit-head!"
"Try that again, and this is gonna happen to your dick."
"Yeah, that's right."
That's your ding-dong in two pieces!
"Oh, I want you to hit me so bad right now!"
"Oh, no, don't."
I'm coming.
Seth Cohen says happy birthday.
Who?
She says thanks.
"Uh, look, I got to go."
Bye.
I got to go meet my friends.
My... other... friends.
"I should get back, too, and protect my cover."
"But wait, listen."
"We have to promise not to tell anyone about this place, okay?"
"Now, Ryan's not going to obviously, and I could get grounded, so that leaves Marissa."
I can keep a secret.
See you tomorrow.
"Me, too."
We'll fix this place up.
Cool.
"I'm telling you, Ryan, this plan is foolproof."
"Hey, Ryan!"
"Hey, Ryan, you ready?"
"Okay, the key here is not to panic."
Do you have your supplies?
"Yeah, but there are cops at your house."
"I mean, do you think it's safe?"
I'll handle Johnny Law unless...are you losing your nerve?
Meet me in the driveway.
He couldn't have gotten far.
We'll search the neighborhood.
Seth.
I was going to get you.
We got to talk about Ryan.
"Hi, Christo."
Manou's resting in her room.
I'll tell her you're here.
Let her rest.
She OK?
Just OK.
Still after that van gang?
Still am.
I hear they hit again.
"Near the beltway, right?"
My only advice is:
"when you bust 'em, shoot first!"
You know anything?
I'm not a snitch.
Ask your questions elsewhere.
Who worked over Manou?
What do you mean?
Leo...
"I'm 46, I spent 1 8 years in jail."
She's the best thing that happened to me.
"Someone hurt her, I gotta know."
"If I tell you, what'll you do?"
That's up to me.
You're in trouble any time you step out of here!
"You're a hood, Christo."
With a record for armed robbery.
"If you smack your neighbor over a trifle, you go back to jail!"
Manou needs you:
"if you go down, so does she."
Screw your cop morality.
"Anyway, it's settled."
I dealt with it.
"Ooh, let's make some spicy ones."
Amy doesn't like spicy.
"Actually, she prefers no meat."
You work at a butcher shop.
Yeah.
"Okay, what about we make some hot sauce to dip them in?"
Good idea.
Remember that time...
No.
Not unless you tell me the time.
You got the fusilli stuck up your nose?
"Okay, whose idea was that?"
And Mrs. Ramsey called the fire department to get it out.
I was turning blue in the face.
I stuck it up both...
"Oh, hi."
"Oh, hi, Amy."
I didn't hear you come in.
"Hi, I take it you're Clementine?"
Yeah.
Nice to meet you.
And who's this?
That's the guy I wanted you to meet.
"That's our son, John."
"Hey, John, say hi to daddy's friend Clementine."
No.
(SIGHS)
It's a great apartment.
"Thanks, yeah, we're good."
"So, how long have you been married?"
"Um, just a couple of weeks now."
"Oh, whoa, so you just got married."
- You're not pleased to see your friend?
- We're not that close.
- He's been causing me a lot oftrouble.
- I'm here to sort it out.
Please sit.
I'll put on some tea.
- Don't bother.
- No need.
- Please be careful.
"- Take care,Jenny."
I know how to do it.
I won't hurt myself.
"Jeffrey, take care ofyour friend, meanwhile."
"Make yourselfat home, Dumbo."
"I am, Mickey Mouse."
"Ma'am, why are you so concerned about the garbage?"
He paid me a thousand bucks to keep you talking.
Don't leave now!
I haven't had this much fun in 20 years!
- You're going to lose this game.
- Am I?
Lets wait and see.
You're always the loser.
Not this time.
I'm well prepared.
Let's put your preparations to the test.
- Are you always so determined?
"- Yes, that's my style."
Mine too.
So we have something in common.
Is that what you think?
Definitely.
You've got it.
Oh.
Goddamn right I have it!
Here!
"We're leaving, and we will never drink your overpriced ""Runaway Root Beers"" again."
But here's a nice tip because you gave us very good service.
Where did that money come from?
- Just be glad I had it.
- Thank you.
It's okay.
We're a team.
What the hell are we gonna do?
I know one thing.
We're gonna put on a brave face.
It's best that the kids don't know how bad things are right now.
We... are... fucked.
"Ooh, it's colder in here than it is outside."
"Okay, Kevin, I'm coming in now!"
I'm not doing anything!
One new message.
"Frank, it's Bob Pogo."
We used to work together at Mohican...
Airways.
It's an airline... down at the airport.
"Aw, shit, you know who I am!"
Here's the thing...
- Is somebody there?
"- Jesus, Dolores, hang up the extension!"
You don't have to bite my head off.
"I'm sorry, dear."
Don't cry.
"- So, Frank..."
Wash your hands first.
Where did that hair come from?
- Where?
- There?
That black thing.
Oh!
There's another one.
"Oh, wait."
It's the full moon!
I must be turning into the beast!
"Yeah, that moustache could do with a trim, too."
- I can see some...
- Ssh!
- Rhydian?
"- 'Listen, mate.'"
I've got a bit of a vomiting situation with my substitute parents.
They're throwing up everywhere.
Oh!
"Yeah, and I'm on bucket duty so I'm not going to be able to make it out."
"OK, well..."
"Oh, there she blows."
"Right, I've got to go."
No Rhydian?
What is it with everyone today?
Must be the full moon.
"You know, we don't have to do this."
- What?
- Stay here.
I don't care how your parents try and justify this.
It's still a cage.
It's still unnatural.
We agreed.
That means... we pretend that we've done nothing for two weeks.
"Put him on, I want to talk to him... I want to talk to him..."
At least give him my message.
I simply can't do that.
No.
Why do they want the material?
"No, answer me."
Why do they want the material?
We don't want to use it as a pillow.
"Yes... ln any case, that's impossible."
Yes... lt sounds as if we're guilty!
I'll contact him myself.
I'll call...
Good-bye.
"Hello, are you well?"
"- Yes, thank you."
- What do you want?
Can I have a word with Farzad?
Sohrabi?
Yes.
He's sitting an exam.
I know. lt won't take a minute.
Please call him for me.
Sohrabi!
You're wanted.
Are you well?
Yes.
Are you sitting an exam?
Yes.
is there a question that you can't answer?
"No, I know them all."
I want to apologise about this morning.
When he was high.
That went on for about 3 or 4 years.
Until one day he strangled me.
And I'd had enough.
I told him he should let me go.
I'd come right back.
"I put my daughter to bed, left her room and stabbed him with a knife."
Six.
Seven.
Ow!
Twelve.
- Come now.
"- Thank you, Master Walter."
Good girl.
It's not even warm yet.
And then I met Marcel.
He was the first man.
I got into SM with.
"He showed me all kinds of things, candle wax and everything."
Until alcohol also came into play.
When he was drunk he had no taboos.
"He tortured me to the extreme with needles, whips, you name it."
Until I ran away covered in blood.
I was in hospital.
laid charges against him.
He got 4 years.
Which he had to serve.
And that was that.
One.
- Two.
- A children's toy.
"From Toys ""R"" Us."
That's not true.
I'm not going to have a child until there's peace in the world.
You just confuse me when you make declarations like that out of the blue.
"OK, I take it back."
I'll put it this way:
"Until the world becomes a peaceful place,"
"I'll be dancing alone, waiting all by myself."
How's that?
"Sounds like something out of a religion called ""dance""."
Good morning.
Thank you.
You're early.
"Yes, yes."
Just a moment.
"Tomoko-san, the phone is for you."
OK.
Excuse me.
"Hello, hello, this is Tomoko."
Yes.
Yes.
Alright.
"I'm sorry, but may I go out for a bit."
"Yes, certainly."
Sorry about this.
Tomoko.
Yes?
"Things are difficult for you, aren't they."
I'm certain about that.
I can tell.
"Yes, there is."
I'll tell you later.
"Pick a good time, but let's talk soon, OK?"
And for dinner.
Your secret room rocked my world.
"Yeah, it did."
But I am gonna give you a deadline.
A deadline?
For our date...
A real date.
It's got to happen tonight.
You get dressed up.
So do I.
"I pick you up... not here, but at your apartment."
"Where is that, by the way?"
"- Oh, it's not far... at all."
"- Okay, good."
And we'll go to my favorite restaurant.
"And afterwards, I show you my place."
Mm.
I-I need a little bit more advance notice.
"How... how about the last Saturday of this month,"
- 'cause tonight I have this...
- Cancel it.
"Look, if you don't do this for me, I..."
I don't know.
"Because your life is here, but... mine is not."
I got it.
You're right.
- I'll meet you by the elevators.
- Mm-hmm.
6:00 P.M.?
And if you aren't there...
I won't be back again.
Mother.
"It's dirty, there's something in the..."
- Jerry.
- What?
What are you doing?
Being forced to work quickly.
"- Normally, I'd be much more charming."
- Take it back!
"It was the biggest mistake I ever made, in my life,"
- not giving that to you.
- Don't... don't...
- Don't do this.
- The situation calls for a grand gesture.
That's all I got.
"I love you, Mel."
"And not being with you, it hurts."
Every day.
"- And it's my fault, I blew it."
- Stop.
"You're right, I should stop."
Jerry this...
- ... isn't going to work.
- It could.
It did.
And then it didn't.
Keep it.
I don't want to throw it away.
OK.
"So, like, hmm, I am..."
"I'm, well..."
"My boyfriend, Luke, hi Luke, he.. he said that he... he wants me to do this, and he told me he doesn't think that I will."
"I, Stacey Ragota, hereby accept the cinnamon challenge."
OK.
He must be someone famous.
Stand back.
I'm going to jump.
"Go ahead, you first."
Rm lumping now.
Go ahead.
I'll wait for my turn.
I'm jumping because nobody loves me.
Nobody loves me either.
I'll get the fireworks going and jump into the garbage can.
How could anyone love someone in this world?
I'm the least loved person in this world.
Me too.
Marjukka doesn't love either of us.
-No.
Let's count to three.
One...
You could've made a good father for me but Mom's too difficult.
Three.
You skipped two.
I'm sorry.
I'll try again.
One...
Two...
I knew you'd chicken out.
There's an ostrich down there.
-What?
Look...
Let's make sure there are no feathers on the scooter.
Then we're out of here.
Do you really think that ostriches would like it here?
It's gotta be around here...
"Ah, shit."
"Yeah, that's ah, that's palladium."
"Riley, you're a fucking idiot."
"Man, just say what?"
Don't talk to my crew like that.
At least he's doin' something.
Have you tried playing dead?
I gotta show you somethin'.
"Blair, I don't get it."
"I mean, there's nothing in this house."
Why would anyone keep it on lock down?
It gets worse.
Great.
"What, we gonna pay Timmy Song back with with a 200 dollar TV?"
So he's into low-budget slasher flicks.
"Really, really big special effects budgets."
Same place.
Same place.
"Ollie, I'm really scared."
Blair.
Let's get out of here.
"I was gonna say I'm really scared too, but yeah, let's get the fuck outta here."
How can Conner's inside not know this?
Hey.
"He had an inside, right?"
That's what it said in the plans.
"No, he lied on the plans."
There's no inside.
Shit.
Connor!
Shit.
It's all your fuckin' fault.
Yup.
- Can I tell you something?
- What?
Don't take this the wrong way
I never got it.
I never thought she was right for you.
"You're too... wild, too alive."
I was wondering if maybe you needed a place to stay tonight.
Griff!
"Natasha's not here, but don't panic."
I got an address from the manager for 20 bucks.
"Hugh, we were thinking about maybe calling it a night..."
No!
No way.
We're on a quest.
He's on a quest!
With a vision.
I did not know that.
- You have a vision?
"- Yes, he does."
It involves a fertility clinic and a stripper.
It's beautiful.
"Sounds gross, actually."
- You can come too.
"- No, you can't."
You're not in the vision.
She's not in the vision.
Marla.
It was good seeing you.
"You too, Griff."
Good luck.
"You OK, baby?"
About what?
Maybe we should take him to see a shrink.
"Look, honey."
"If we can just be patient,"
I think we can handle this.
We both love Mikey; right?
We're the ones that are gonna help him out.
Mom.
Mom!
( Gasping ) Mikey.
I was looking for you.
- What are you doing?
- I have something for you.
"Mikey, you have to learn to knock."
They're for being such a great mom.
Why don't you take the flowers downstairs and put them in some water while I get out; okay?
Mom.
Hmm?
"Mom, what if I..."
I'm getting cold.
"If I threw this in the bathtub, it would work just like an electric chair."
You're right.
Be a good boy and unplug it.
( Gunfire on TV )
This is so cool when they blast their way out.
- How do you know?
- I've seen it three times.
"Hi, guys."
How many dead?
"I know how much you miss your cat, so I got you a new one."
"Oh, thank you, Mick."
( Doorbell Ringing )
"Oh, they're a bunch of fucking liars."
The president is a liar.
I think there may be a problem.
Only problem is you motherfucker think I can't hear you!
"Hi, Mr. Freeman."
Unh!
Hey!
"Damn it, watch where you're going, bitch!"
What the fuck is wrong with you?
!
Shit I ought to whup your big ass!
Now get the fuck out of my way!
"- Slow down, granddad!"
"- Granddad, watch out for that curb!"
Ow!
I can't find my seat belt!
"Whoa, hey, granddad, I think we should talk about your eyesight and whether it's safe to drive."
I've been driving my whole life!
I don't need to know how to see to drive!
Shut up!
"Now, what the fuck is this?"
!
I hate when people do that.
I hate it!
I hate it!
I fucking Hate it!
That was supposed to be our space!
You know what?
You know what?
!
Fuck That!
"That's our space, God damn it!"
Can't stand it!
Can't stand it!
Why are they treating this car like it's a hotel?
What's wrong?
Why did you suddenly stop?
It's no fun.
Okay.
I can get out.
What are you doing?
Are you teasing me?
What's the matter?
Did something happen?
Just restrain yourself for another 2 minutes.
We will be arriving at the hotel in 2 minutes.
"Hey, who do you think you are?"
"If I say I can't help it, what will you do?"
Hey?
!
"Even if I am prepared to be understanding,"
"I just can't stand you people, I can't drive you anymore."
I'm not driving!
I quit!
I quit!
Hey!
Drive.
I'm not driving.
I quit.
You!
We originally agreed that I will get 20 000 Won for driving you there.
Just give me 10 000 won.
What?
"I've worked, so you need to at least pay right?"
Hey.
Hey.
Hey!
I can't believe you guys are both here again.
Neither can I.
I can't believe it even more.
"Uh, I thought we agreed Lana was off limits."
"No, I wasn't there for Lana."
"Okay, I care about Noel."
Noah.
His name is Noah.
"It is, right?"
Wait.
Now Noah sounds wrong.
Wait.
"Why are you scolding me, man?"
You were the one bringing her flowers.
They were for norm.
Noel.
Man...
"All right, look, look."
We're both wrong.
"Hitting on Lana is a total violation of several commandments, many edicts, and at least one mores."
Or hang on.
I'm about to blow your mind.
It's only bad if we like the dude.
"Uh-huh, uh-huh, I'm listening."
"Yeah, this guy owes me eight bucks!"
You know what?
He does not return phone calls promptly!
Let me ask you this.
What if he's a racist?
- That's beside the point.
"""Ghastly little man,"" you call him."
Right.
I might as well go to bed.
You coming?
"Not for a minute, no."
"[Man singing on radio, indistinct]"
[Humming]
[Dorcas]:
"So you want pilchards, do you?"
[Janet]:
I think so.
We always used to use coley fish.
I'm sure.
I think pilchards would be better.
"You gonna make it, are you?"
All right.
What did he think of my pasties?
He loved them.
Ha!
Thought he might.
Don't forget the washing.
Looks like rain.
You know...
"When Andrea's able to walk, he's going to need some clothes."
"Yes, I know."
- I thought I'd use some of the money Aunt Elizabeth left me to get him a new outfit.
Why?
"What do you mean, ""why""?"
Why not use our joint account?
What?
We're both responsible for him.
No le dejen mover.
Take off your clothes.
She's clean.
"Viktor Karp, I'm Regan."
Agent Regan of Homeland Security.
ETU.
I'm out.
That's why I'm here.
What happened here?
I had a baby.
The humans took it.
Why you want to see Liana?
I'm her daughter.
Liana doesn't have a daughter.
You're at home.
So I see.
I had you brought here.
We needed you someplace private in case you said something you shouldn't.
"Flynn, you got a drug problem."
No.
- No.
I got an alien problem.
"- Well, you need to deal with it before I let you back on the team."
Team?
Right.
"'Cause we're all just team players, aren't we, Truss?"
You're using me.
You're using Regan.
God knows what you got on Briggs.
You are privy to information that is beyond classified.
"And if I don't come back and play, you're gonna contain me?"
If I have to.
- Right!
And I want to buy it.
But I dont want to sell it.
Think about it!
I will give you whatever you ask for!
But I still wont agree!
Not even for 50?
Not even for 55!
60?
You dont understand!
"Look, I have told you."
70?
Who are you?
80?
Whats so special about this mansion?
I mean to say that..
90!
Wait a minute!
Wait!
If you want it so badly then I wont disappoint you!
I want to ask you one thing.
"But I hope you are not kidding, right?"
I dont do that!
"Then come with the money, I will get ready the documents!"
I have already prepared the documents!
Very good.
-You wiIIjust have to sign them!
My man is waiting outside with 90 lakh.
Just go and open the door!
Okay.
Wait a minute!
Dont hang up!
"Yeah, maybe ten?"
Ten?
"Yeah, me too."
"But, did you get any flowers?"
I think you know I did.
"I thought it was really sweet, and I was gonna say, if you're not busy, we could hang out this Friday?"
I think I'm free.
"Yep, yes I am."
I'm working on the bar at a local Valentine's disco thing.
"It's under-18s, so it might be a bit lame, but if you fancied keeping me company?"
A date?
"No, Will, not a date."
Just two friends hanging out.
Great.
See you Friday.
It's a date.
"No, it's not a date."
Cool.
"She said it wasn't a date, but we both knew it was."
"Before that,"
"I had to make the most of my new, pointless, shitty manual job."
Hellooooo?
"Will MacKenzie, I'm here for work experience."
"Hello, you must be Will."
"Great to meet you, I'm Jim."
This here's Wolfie and Steve.
"Hi, Jim, hi, Steve, hello, Wolf."
Wolf-ie.
"Wolfie, right, gotcha."
You'll have a right laugh.
Long as you don't mind a bit of blue talk.
"- Not a poof, are ya?"
"You're busy selling your gear, so you don't need mine."
"You've got it all wrong, mate."
"- Shh, it's fine, fine."
"Let's call the boss, see what he thinks, shall we?"
"For-for fuck's sake, Jonesy."
"Just, this shit doesn't grow on trees."
You know what it's like.
I'm on hold on your tip-off...
"Just go away, just go!"
I was just explaining about the private party.
This isn't...
Not a problem...
Get a cab
Be careful.
Why don't you join us?
I wouldn't wanna intrude.
"Maybe, uh, maybe another time."
- Guide me.
- Swivel round and rock back.
"Yeah, that's it."
Okay.
"Come inside, I insist."
"Quick, come on."
"You can do it, come on."
Just go for it!
Gem!
Fuck!
Let's see how you like it.
No!
"Gem, listen to me."
Focus.
There's a saw.
"No, no, no, no, no, no."
This is about Kitty's social life.
I don't really want to intrude.
"Oh, trust me."
She loves to intrude.
She lives to intrude.
Nonsense.
You know what?
I love mother-daughter teams.
- It's twice as much fun.
- OK.
"Well, she loves contractors."
- Kitty.
"- Nora, I feel so confident in this,"
I'm not gonna charge you for this consultation.
Sit down.
Sit!
Great.
"OK, here's what we're gonna do."
Hey.
So this is really good.
"I would just change ""watchdog"" to ""necessary vigilance."""
Protection over fear?
It's good.
I like it.
Sit down.
I'll go over the whole thing.
"You know, actually, I..."
I kind of have to go.
Is it OK if we run through it tomorrow?
It's a personal matter.
- Oh.
- Did he tell you he went to see Marosi ?
- No.
"He's bottling it up, he's dealing with all of this on his own."
I bet he didn't tell you his girlfriend dumped him.
Hold on one second.
"Alright you lot, leave him alone."
"What's going on, Stevie ?"
Talk to me.
I don't want to take it.
I think you should kick that ball as hard as you can.
Go for it.
"Listen to me, Pru."
"He's going through a lot right now, so... promise me you'll be there if he needs you."
I promise.
"Ok, great."
Bye.
I think I have one for you.
Please...
Please...
It's all right.
I'm here to help you.
"Mark, it's me."
Listen...
I need Pru's number.
She should be in a hospital.
"No, sorry,no can do."
Hospitals require all kind of information.
"- No, you're doing great."
- She needs an internal scan.
Did she have anything on her ?
A phone or ID ?
She is yet to speak.
J.E.
Pepper!
Pepper!
Here we are!
Come on!
"Come on, digger!"
"Come on, there you go!"
"There you go, digger!"
Go get it!
Go get it!
Fetch!
"Fetch, digger!"
"Go, digger!"
"I didn't know you walked out this way, Andrew."
Yes.
One of digger's favorite spots when I'm in the area.
"Fit, are you?"
"- Yes, can't complain."
"My word, look at him go."
He's like a whippet.
"- Yes, isn't he?"
Sheer joy of living I call it.
Still digging up neighbor's gardens?
"Yes, digger by name, digger by nature."
"There's no cure in the book for that, I'm afraid."
"Actually, James,"
I'm glad we ran into each other.
I've been wanting to see you about digger.
"There's nothing wrong with him, is there?"
"Not really, but he is having some problems with his eyes."
How do you mean?
"- Alright, but hurry."
- Okay.
Tasty.
"You know, I'm honest only as much as I want to be."
How come?
"Well, just that I'm not so different from your character."
Really?
- Are you all by yourself?
"- Yes, she left."
"Anyway, both ladies are pretty tall, including the one before."
Aren't they?
How about the face?
Don't they look alike?
"Well, I can't say."
I couldn't see their faces closely.
- Is that so?
Alright.
- Good-bye.
But don't they look alike?
"Uh, sure."
That's possible.
- Good night.
"- Yes, good night."
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.
Would you like to have some?
What's this?
Were you drinking all by yourself?
"I'm the type you like, aren't I?"
"Yes, you're right."
I'm not having sex with you.
I am not having sex with you.
It's a case you worked on when you were a copper.
"Jesse, Alan's boy."
"He's back, Dad."
Jesse's come back.
Leave her!
Dad?
Look at him.
"- Take his face away from me, please."
"- Dad, he didn't do it."
He admitted to it.
And you believe that?
Dad I know he wrote you letters.
"- I destroyed them, they gave me the creeps."
- All of them?
- Yes.
What about mom?
Did she keep any of them?
You know what?
You're gonna have to ask her that.
"What is all this, Mark?"
It was 20 years ago.
Why are you bringing all this up again?
"Here we are, one chicken curry and one lamb tagine, sir."
Enjoy it.
- Disgusted or not you must have read them.
"- Yes, of course I read them."
- And?
Well you know he wanted us to meet him.
Wanted us to a... to talk.
- But of course we wouldn't entertain the idea.
- Why not?
'Coz he killed your brother.
"Okay, I'm on my way."
Josh needs my help.
Esme's stoned.
- What?
- Yeah.
He wants me to go over and give her a talk.
- Really?
- Mm.
The first thing I got into trouble with as a teenager was smoking weed.
Mmm.
Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.
It's delicious.
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.
I'm glad you called.
"Guess you want me to come down pretty hard, right?"
Yeah.
She'll listen to you...
I hope.
- She's pretty stoned.
- Is she?
It's not funny.
"No, I know."
"For three, and it's good."
"He is just 3 of 13 behind the arch, and he puts up a big three to give his team a four-point lead."
This is a high-resolution S.P.E.C.T. Image of a chronic marijuana user.
"Okay, so, here you can see the decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex."
This is bad.
Oh.
"The, uh..."
"Weed, it can, uh... can trigger psychosis."
Aunt Kate?
Sure.
Come out!
Come out in the end.
We got them all.
Is there one left?
We can meet together now.
Where are you?
Why don't you come out?
What do you want?
"My name is Jurgen Hoffman, I'm a scientist."
I've come to get you out of here.
We should leave immediately.
What do you know?
I've watched through this window.
I've witnessed the deaths from over there.
I know how and why they died.
"You're in great danger, come with me."
So you tell me why they died.
What difference does it make to you?
Now.
Come with me.
Wait a minute you come to my place and you want me to leave and you don't want to tell me why?
"Ok, you have a creature, an alien creature on your roof."
Where?
I study these creatures.
"You're in great danger, come with me."
-Tell me where he is.
-You want to die?
-No.
-Let me explain.
-Let me go.
-Let me explain.
"And it's left-hand drive, so you're a cheapskate."
It's true!
It's never overtaken anyone.
That's what passengers are for.
His dog ate it.
She did.
A couple more I have to stick up -
"Mitsubishi Evo VIII, we looked at."
Where's it go?
AUDIENCE:
Sub-cool?
Wrong!
Why is it sub-cool?
It's a proper car.
It's fast and it handles well.
That's nothing to do with coolness.
It's like having ginger hair.
Anyone else got any thoughts on it?
MAN:
Uncool.
Uncool.
"He says it's uncool, he's kind of right."
"The thing is, it's very gender-specific."
"If you're a man, it's really uncool."
"If you're a woman, it's fantastic."
We wanna meet you.
"So it kind of goes there, as does...the same story with the Subaru."
Yeah.
Put that there.
Right in the middle with the F60.
"It's funny, it's the way of the cool wall."
"I've got one last one here, the Peugeot 206 GTI 180bhp."
- Better than tits you'll ever get mate!
"All right, I'd spunk over the big ones, and they're not better than I'd get."
Bollocks.
"Here, Steve..."
- Speccy here... reckons he has better!
- Stop that.
- I have.
"- Fuck off, you're a virgin!"
- Classic virgin.
- You're wrong.
I did it last year.
With a girl I'm seeing tonight.
"Yeah, sure."
Yep!
"She's fit, she's older than me, and she goes like a porn star."
"- Oh, right!"
"- Yeah, and she's got massive titties and I..."
"Well, I... fucked her hard and all night long."
What are you and this dirty horn bucket up to this weekend then?
I might come and check her out.
"Going to an under-18 disco where she works, so you won't be able to."
I could go.
- What?
- I could go.
I'm 17.
You're 17!
?
- You're 17?
"- Yeah, yeah"
- I just look older.
There's looking older and then there's that.
You look about 30!
Go hide and keep quiet!
"Stop Mieze, stop!"
Promise that you won't look behind that curtain!
I promise...
I promise.
I promise that I won't look behind that curtain.
- Yes.
There you go.
"I guess you brought something along, right?"
Stop giving me presents!
What's wrong with that?
Why not?
We have everything we need.
"I have a dress, you have your clothes."
What would we need more things for?
Because it's nice.
- What?
"- Franz, I wanna tell you something."
Go ahead!
I want to wear my old dress!
Blimey!
"We'll look for work, even if it's on a yard."
Why?
Why?
Where did you get that fur from?
I met an old friend.
"- He told you things about me, huh?"
- No.
- But you let him give you a fur!
- Yes!
And I can't?
I can't give you anything?
"Hey, man."
"It's all good, right?"
"Look, you get a little money in your pocket."
Nothing wrong with that.
"Just for now, right?"
Plus it's always good to have a roommate that can pay his half of the rent.
"Hey, what do you say you and me head down to the rec center?"
Got a pick-up rugby game going on.
"Then afterwards, maybe go get me some ribs, some corn."
Some hot chicks.
Maybe she got a friend for you.
But one of them ugly ones.
"Buck-toothed and, you know, just got the fangs."
"Got the fangs happening, huh?"
Know what?
Yeah.
Huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Just give me a couple minutes to change and then we'll head on out.
"Oh, dinner's on you tonight."
You still owe me...
"I think, what is it, $19.40?"
"Oh, you're serious about that?"
So...
Yeah.
Dinner and girls.
Both on you tonight.
"No, the girls will be on me."
I...
What are you doing in my office with your butt in the air?
I was hoping for an injection.
Go to the waiting room.
This isn't an outpatient surgery!
They told me to wait here.
See?
Another example.
"This is an affront to Professor Ciotti,   and shows lack of respect for a person of his stature."
I'll report you to the Academic Senate and have you expelled.
"Cicchirini, calm down!"
And you... get out of here.
Out!
What about my injection?
You expect me to give you an injection?
Get out!
Out!
Motherfuckers...
- Did you do it?
- Me?
No.
Was it you?
"- No, no!"
Maybe it was him.
- I didn't do... it was him.
It wasn't me.
Who is it?
"""Who is it?"" That's for me to say!"
Who is it?
Am I disturbing you?
"No, no, my dear."
Come in.
You're never disturbing.
- I'm...
Shh!
(Whispers) I came to apologise about yesterday.
Is that the only reason you came?
"No, it isn't."
Now I've really lost Bill.
- I am going to the police.
- Please...
That's no good.
No point crying over spilt milk.
You don't understand.
It's not his money I care about.
I really love him.
"So, now I'm getting my own back on that beastly Dennis."
Just a minute.
You said you saw a file on that authoress Flora Ransom?
- Yes.
- Right!
We're going to see her.
I have a few questions to ask that murderous woman.
Excuse me.
- Have a good time.
- I am not going to have a good time!
Is Mrs Ransom in?
She's out but we are expecting her back soon.
Come in.
Thank you.
My name's Bastable.
I'm the lucky fellow she's consented to marry.
"She's a widow, you know."
This way.
"Oh, was Flora expecting you?"
- If she hurt you...
"- No, no."
She... she didn't lay a hand on me.
"I'm fine, really, I'm just..."
I'm just tired.
Whose body am I in?
You've seen Liana.
"That's what happened to your face, isn't it?"
"Dad, tell me the truth."
"Where did this, me, come from?"
I need to know.
Musa sent you to us from a breeding camp.
"Your mother found you a human skin, even though I knew what it meant... an innocent."
Did it have a name?
The baby?
Allison.
"From the day you became Allison,"
I vowed to protect you with my life.
But...
I failed you.
No.
Yes.
We should have left.
Gone on the run.
"I'm so, so sorry."
"Dad, don't."
You did everything you could to protect me.
I always will.
I don't know what you're saying.
I'm saying that I love you.
"As long as I'm alive, you're in danger."
- They'll use us against each other.
"No way, we have a show coming up tonight."
Do the box again.
"Kids, didn't you hear me?"
We have a show tonight.
"Bye, kids."
All the best.
"Everything will be okay, my sweetie."
Give me a hug.
Barbuda loves you.
"- Bye, kids."
- Bye.
Here.
For you.
Maybe you'll need it someday.
"It's yours now, Maria."
"We promise that whenever the circus is around, or close enough, we'll come visit you, okay?"
"Look out for her, Quico."
"Maria, let me go."
"Be good, sweetie."
"Bye, kids."
My ring fell into the sea and it was lost to me the waters gave me a seashell as a present for you
Come on and eat Maria.
Do you still like chocolate milk?
Yes.
So...
Didn't you like the nightgown I bought for you?
But it's so pretty.
I've picked your school.
I'll take you to meet the principal.
She wants you to take a test.
But I've always studied!
In the circus?
"- No no no, not yet."
Don't you just love the city at night?
I wish I was one of those insomniacs.
I could live my whole life at night.
"Well, except I'd probably get rickets or something."
- Try a doughnut?
"- No, I'm alright, thanks."
Where is she?
In there.
So what's the story then?
"Just look after her, make sure she's OK."
Help her settle in.
- Be kind.
"- Yeah, good."
Ready?
Brit!
"No, I should check it."
Let me guess: work?
What?
We have finally finally traced the mobile of the victim from the scene where we found your friend's DNA.
Her name's Annie Green.
"For the best bit, it's turned on."
- You saying we track it?
- Already on it.
Alright.
I have to go.
"Momma, my sister, I have to go."
- Go.
- I'll see you later.
- I'll come back.
- Go.
Chopper is on the way there now.
Tell him I'll pick him up at 7.
Tell Nathan to come see me.
I'll do what I can.
Peyton?
Peyton!
- Where's Peyton?
- Dressing for school is my guess.
Who are you?
I'm the guy who's about to take that rake from you and beat your scrawny ass.
I'm her dad.
Who are you?
Oh.
Sorry.
The front door was open and I thought...
I'm Lucas.
Larry Sawyer.
"Hey dad, do you know where my..."
What are you doing here?
Oh he's trying to rake me to death.
What?
!
I thought you were... nothing crucial.
I'm gonna go put this back.
"- So, who's the guy?"
- What guy?
The one that's got you smiling.
That'd be my dad.
"Oh, I'd be smiling too but for entirely different reasons."
"Dude, that's my dad!"
Don't go all horndog on me.
There's a line!
"Speaking of which, I really don't wanna cross any so tell me if this is totally inappropriate to ask."
"No matter how much I mess up, they'll be there to help me."
But if he can't control his power -- it's all right.
How is it all right?
"By now, Steven has realized his powers are tied to his emotions."
Just like I knew would happen.
"He's used the memories of happy and sad things to land safely behind us, ready to give us a hug."
[ Grunts ]
Close enough.
Guys!
Wait!
You have somewhere else to be!
What?
There's no time!
Run to the big donut!
Run!
"Uh, okay!"
I would've liked a hug.
[ Panting ]
[ Gasps ] No way!
"No way, no way, no way, no way!"
Ooh!
Oh. [ Chuckles ]
Uh...
You're just opening?
I thought I was late!
Late?
We always open at 7:30 on Sundays.
"Ahh, duh!"
"Well, you're just in time."
Here you go!
My treat!
A fresh-baked frosted donut with sprinkles!
It's me.
Where are you?
What about you?
Don't ask me anything.
You need to get to your daughter.
Now.
Tell me what's going on?
I'm at your place.
"Get back to your house, now."
First tell me what's going on.
I...
I misread the divination.
It's not him.
What are you talking about?
I cast the hex on the wrong ghost.
I saw a woman in front of your house.
I made a grave mistake.
"A terrible, terrible mistake."
It's not the Japanese man.
That woman is the evil spirit.
It was all her doing.
"So, go home now."
"I'm on my way there, too."
Then...
Who's the Japanese man?
He was trying to kill that woman in order to save people from her.
Understand?
"That Japanese man- he's a shaman, like me."
Was the woman... wearing white?
Did you see her?
A young woman?
That's her.
"Come on, buddy."
What'd we talk about this year?
- Balance and torque.
"- That's right, come on."
Let's go!
See what you got.
"Hey, your head's moving all over the place, like this."
You're all over.
"Connor, pivot the back foot."
Pivot like this.
Pivot.
That's better.
"Hey, way to go."
Nice hit.
Good job.
"Look, that front foot's gotta land in the same place every time."
- It slipped.
- No excuses!
Come on!
"Hey, what's the matter with you?"
Your focus is all over the place today.
Need a refill?
A soda?
"- Uh, it's a vanilla shake."
"- Oh, yeah."
We don't do refills on shakes.
- Yeah.
I figured.
"- Yeah, vanilla's my favorite."
"It has to be really good vanilla, though."
"You should, um, check out the place down the street, in the mini-mall on Olamar."
Best shakes in town.
"I mean, you call these problems?"
"""Oh, it's horrible."
"Someone wrote in the sky for me. """
I'd kill to find a little note in my diaphragm case.
Oh...
But that's just me.
Then maybe he should be with you.
"No, Joanne."
"Joanne, wait."
Wait.
This is the best party ever.
- Nice speech.
- It was horrible.
I thought it was great.
"Oh, happy people complaining."
"No, they deserve to be yelled at."
I'm Richie.
Lina.
"No, I know."
Um
"- You sat in front of me in Ms. Klinger's class, but then in fourth grade you were gone."
We transferred to private school.
After Kat was expelled for telling Mr. Dubin he looked like a penis.
"He did, he kinda looked like a penis."
"Yeah, and the turtlenecks didn't help."
I like your hat.
Are-are you making fun of me?
'Cause I don't think I could handle-
"No, I like it."
"It's, um... jaunty."
Hey.
"Couldn't have looked like crap just a little, huh?"
"- Sorry, it looks like a pigsty."
- Do you spend wisely.
So it is now.
What an ugly bag.
"- There are more than 200,000."
"- There are actually 500,000."
Jaså.
We clean up after yourself.
- I've messed up!
- It is you who have fucked you!
I salute the way from Vijay.
He got 10 years!
Shit.
Moment
"No, let it sit."
- Your fucking snitch.
"- Yes, I'm a fucking snitch."
Come on.
Hold this.
Wait here.
- They have several informants.
"- Bye, Dad."
You can even see in the new documents.
I send them over a secure line.
"Well, and if I need to check other cases ..."
Can I call you back?
What are you doing here?
Do you know why we tolerate your kind?
Because I just fit your work.
But you have gone too far.
Now there shall be no rules anymore.
I have not done anything.
Wow!
You know what I think?
I don't think you're gonna do a fucking thing...
"I think you're just gonna stand there, like the little girl you are..."
And I'm gonna grab that stick...
and ram it right up your ass...
And then...?
You're goin' swimming.
hey hey quickly
Dude....
Zoric is over there checking us out let it go...
We'll beat his little ass later...
Give me the stick...
Give me the stick...
Holy shit!
Are you fucking crazy!
?
Hey!
Okay.
"Please, move back."
move back
"Give me one reason I shouldn't suspend you, Owen..."
Can you think of one?
Don't you know what could've happened...?
You seem like a smart kid.
I just don't want to see you going down the wrong path...
He's a good boy... he really is...
Hello...?
Is John there...?
Excuse me...?
This is his wife who's this...?
"hello, Cindy..."
- What if they are ghosts?
- There are no ghosts.
That's enough.
"If they are alive, they must be exhausted."
We'll easily catch them.
- We must try to capture them alive.
- Why?
I want to finish them off.
Over here.
I can see them.
Give me that.
Stupid bitches.
- They've gone.
- They're in one of the wrecks.
We can't search all the wrecksl
"Did you see anything, Bosco?"
I haven't seen them.
They must still be here.
- We must wait until daybreak.
- We'll find them eventually.
I know how to drive them out.
"Paul, bring your lamp."
"Come here, all of you."
Le Bosco has an idea.
You come down too!
- Hurry up.
- Let's go.
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to burn them.
Give me your lantern.
Stay here and tell me if you see them.
Bosco!
Oh my dick!
"Now, you are charged with murdering."
You can employ your own lawyer to defend for you.
Do you have any lawyer?
Yes!
Chan Mon-gut!
Shit!
"Mister, are you ready?"
I've found Master.
Good!
Let's go.
"After the shaving, no hair will be left."
"You can't regret, Mister,"
do you want a second thought?
Come on.
Stop!
"Fleas are living in my armpit, why do you stop me?"
May I have a little bit freedom?
"Mister, do you want to go on?"
"Yes, please."
Foon is being charged with hom4cide in Hong Kong.
What?
Yes.
Hey!
What?
Are you going to save him?
How?
"If you don't, he will die."
People will die sooner or later!
You are smart and wise!
I can't help...
He committed crime in HK which is governed by British law.
Who's gonna read me a story?
"Just read it yourself, OK?"
Not now.
OK.
Well?
Tell me his name.
(Sighs)
It doesn't matter now.
I'm back here in the loving bosom of the family.
"Yes, it does matter."
Who did you screw?
13-1.
Yep.
"Good, see ya."
The PDO's sent you a murder.
"Hey, you know we're out of this room tomorrow."
"A street kid, tortured and murdered."
There goes all the fun.
I don't mind adults whacking each other but this stuff twists you.
So Barney will meet you in remand.
Barney's instructing?
"That's good, isn't it?"
Yeah.
Good.
He'll meet you there.
Did you know the deceased?
Had you had an argument with him?
Had he tried to rob you?
Provoke you?
Had you had sex with him?
I'm not into boys.
You're currently living in a shelter in Abbotsford.
I always loved watching him sleep.
I take it you're setting out for Candor in the morning?
Yeah.
"Listen, I only want what's best for him."
You hardly even know him.
"You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?"
"But deep down, I think you're scared"
I know him all too well.
I'm not scared.
Of course you are.
You're scared he'll finally see you for what you really are.
Deadly.
You don't believe me?
Ask him.
(PANTING)
FOUR:
You okay?
Yeah.
You sure?
Yeah.
I'm not coming with you guys.
What?
To Candor.
I'm not coming with you guys.
What are you talking about?
What's your plan?
You guys are gonna find the rest of Dauntless.
Then what?
"You attack Erudite, assassinate Jeanine, start a civil war?"
"I'm sorry, I'm just not..."
I'm not cut out for that.
I'm not like you guys.
"Oh no, don't shoot!"
I hate violence!
I'm here to tell you a secret!
Put your pistol away!
What secret?
Get it out!
"Alright, but I have one condition!"
What condition?
I want Yoyo to kiss me once.
Supermac 99!
I order you to kiss her.
"Lucky you, kiddo!"
"In the name of our country, kiss her!"
Go on!
- You have to close your eyes!
- O.K.!
"Hey, wake up. lt's done!"
Japan cabled today.
Hiroshima only has a phoney Formula.
You have the real one!
We all know that!
That's why the other secret is even more important!
What other secret?
"I'll tell, but I have to kiss Yoyo this time."
What a pity!
Serves you right!
"Alright, but you have to close your eyes again!"
Sure thing!
My first kiss!
"Don't faint, wake up!"
"Now, what's the secret?"
My father Fat Pig is coming with his troops to get you.
- Fuck!
Watch out for cheetahs!
This is cheetah turf.
- What?
- OK.
Fuck.
We hit ocean.
What do we do now?
All right.
"Hey, look, look!"
Excuse me.
You guys going to America?
"Sí, vamos."
"Yes, we're going."
Thank you.
- Es mío.
"- Vamos, vamos."
"I'm telling you, Jorge... the first thing you have to do when you get to America... buy a device called TiVo, OK?"
Freedom means nothing if you're a slave to regular programming...
I promise you that.
"And now, how about you focus?"
We gotta figure out what to do when we get to the States.
We don't have wallets.
We don't have any ID.
We've got nothing.
"Well, I figure we're gonna land somewhere around Miami, right?"
There's only one guy we know who lives down there.
- Who do we know that--Raza.
- Yeah.
We gotta go see Raza.
- Adiós.
- Hasta luego.
- Adam.
"No, dude, that is Adam."
"Dude, that is Pete."
Can you give us a sec?
"Live it up, football jocks!"
- It's all downhill from here.
- Oh!
It's going down!
I just heard!
"Here, tonight!"
It's going down!
Nice dress.
Did your mom make it?
"Listen to me, damn it!"
"I didn't see them, but I heard their plan."
"""At 11:00 sharp, we shank the dork."""
"Ellie, some poor kid's getting pantsed!"
"No, this can't be happening."
Not now!
Not again!
"Boo, you got your crazy face on."
A-are you all right?
[ Sighs deeply ] 1987.
Senior prom.
I was so excited.
"I had a cool tux, a hot date, and a plan to help my best pal Bucky Martin score a dance with the girl of his dreams."
Bucky Martin?
Sounds like a stud.
- He actually wasn't.
- Stop it.
"But I knew he could be, if he-- if he just believed."
"And then when I saw Cindy Lee standing alone at the punch bowl,"
Have some coffee.
It'll wake you up.
can we have the check?
What are you doing?
I got to go.
We just got here.
I got that thing.
We'll leave together.
one at a time.
I couldn't stand him.
I thought he was really obnoxious.
He kept fidgeting around.
do you?
That's very annoying.
but it'd look funny on my table.
Ready?
Lighten up.
We just got here.
What are you doing?
he was pushing me into the car thenpullingme out.
Itwasridiculous.
Diane and Tommy made us promise to meet them again on Friday.
We agreed.
Henry stood me up.
I feel terrible.
I don't know where he is.
He really liked you.
All he did was talk about her.
We were a trio instead of a double date.
He should have called.
I hope it's nothing serious.
But I made Tommy take me looking for him.
Hold it!
"Ah, Mr. MacGyver, we've been expecting you."
You should know your partner here tried to kill us.
Cleeve!
Is this true?
Don't be naive.
Did you really think I'd leave them to follow us or call the police?
Good thinking.
We didn't come alone.
"Oh, come on."
You don't think I'm gonna fall for an old trick like that?
No!
"Yeah, sure, now who's side are you on?"
Yours.
Can we discuss it later?
"He's got a point, MacGyver."
Come on.
Which way?
The plane.
"Oh, MacGyver..."
"Uh, MacGyver."
There's something I've got to tell you.
Later.
Get in.
Um...
The window!
There's no key for the magneto switch.
That was what I was trying to tell you.
I removed it so they couldn't take off with the artifacts.
That's a great idea.
Where is it?
Out there.
What're you doing here in the middle of night
You want to break into my shop?
"I'm sorry, boss, I need 1 0 grams of Tianqi 50 grams of Baiyao, also..."
Are you mad?
You know what time it is?
Come again tomorrow!
Please help.
It's a matter of life and death
What does it have to do with me!
I need to sleep!
"You can't sleep, boss!"
"Asshole, no sympathy at all"
All you want is sleep!
Think you can sleep no more?
What are you looking at?
Get off!
Asshole
I'll make it hard for you to sleep!
Sleep!
I'll let you sleep!
Son of a bitch!
Sleep!
Since you like to sleep!
Damn it
Sleep!
I'll let you sleep!
What are you doing?
The gold is mine
"It has the word ""San"" engraved on it"
Doesn't this belong to Zhou Sanzhao?
So you know Zhou Sanzhao?
"Don't get me wrong, I didn't steal it"
"Come on, we must get him out of here."
Hurry up.
Careful.
Take it easy.
Shit!
Let's go - they've mined the entire dam!
They're running away.
Let's go!
Come on!
The whole place is going to blow up!
"Come on, get over there!"
Get away from there!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Careful.
- Dad!
Dad!
"- What happened, Pablito?"
- I saw men with guns.
- Were they soldiers?
"No, revolutionaries."
They're coming to our village.
- What do they want?
- Let's wait and see.
We are your friends.
I hope you know that.
We'll march on soon.
All we're asking for is provisions and water.
"We'll rest a bit, and then we'll march on."
"My village is poor, but we'll share."
I love these gushing receptions.
Really charming.
The usual way.
Somebody pointed a gun at her and pulled the trigger .
Who?
It's complicated.
"Well, it all kind of makes sense now."
Why ?
You talked about her in you sleep some times.
I do ?
Yea.
Dreaming Flowers
Vi ?
"Yeah, man"
I can't wait until we get the dresses.
Things are going to change for us after that.
Oh hell yeah !
Do we need to chain it up?
Nah.
This'll do .
If you touch you DIE
Cool?
Cool.
This really is the last time I'm going to say this to you...
Okay ?
Or anything else.
I don't want you to send me anything anymore.
I don't...
I threw out the flowers.
You can't fix it!
And I'm really done with you.
"I don't want to talk to you again, I don't want to hear from you again."
I want you to leave me alone.
Please .
Takehara sees Mother a lot?
I don't know.
Come in!
Hello.
Hello.
What do you think?
Will you let us use it?
It's a little embarrassing.
It'll get you a lot in return if you do let me use it.
My mother says that she can't make it today.
I think you were supposed to go the Kabuki with her.
Has something come up?
My father came back.
I see.
Welcome.
It's been a while.
How are you?
Same as ever.
"Takao, I haven't seen you in ages."
Is your mother well?
Yes.
You should come to Kamakura.
The beach is really popular.
I'd like to get there this summer.
Excuse me.
Someone from the Kokuminsha is here.
"Send him in, please."
Will you be going in the bath later?
"I will, but after we're done talking."
Make yourself at home.
Mother was a friend of hers wasn't she?
"Yes, I think they were very close."
I'm sorry.
l-l don't even like Nikki.
I was trippin' off Kenny.
"You can't help who you love, Derek."
You're not supposed to.
"When you love somebody, you love them."
Look at me.
At least you found somebody who loves you back.
I gotta go.
Where you going ?
"Stay out of my business, Chenille."
I know what Malakai wants you to do.
"Why are you trippin' off him, Derek ?"
All you're trying to do is get the hell up out of here.
Ain't no shame or blame in that.
It's getting cold out here.
Take that baby inside.
Hey.
Hey.
"Kai, I've been trying to catch up with you."
I gotta talk to you.
- Ready to roll ?
- l gotta talk to you.
- Wassup ?
"- Look, man. I ain't going with you."
What you mean you're not going ?
-You know what I mean.
-Did you come here to waste my time?
"This shit is nonsense, Kai."
It's dangerous nonsense.
"Just back up off it, man."
Come on.
- Yeah?
"- Yeah, of course."
- We'll have you guys over.
Maybe I'll make some of my famous apps and we can throw some games in there.
"- That'll be fun, right?"
"- Hey, can you make those baby hot dogs that look like they're taking a nap in pastry?"
"- Oh, pigs in a blanket."
"- Yeah, I guess you could make those, too, if you want, pfft."
All right.

You did not have to make me dinner.
I haven't ever made anything other than a DiGiorno's pizza.
"Well, I'm sure it's delicious."
"Okay, here we go, right?"
[chuckles]
All right.
Bon appétit.
All right.
"Now, is this a chicken or a fish?"
It is a chicken.
"Mm, can't wait."
Okay. [crunches]
"- Ooh, there's a crackle."
- Mm-hmm.
What is this?
There are...
What is...?
Rice Krispies.
It's a Rice Krispie crusted chicken.
"Mm, did you come up with that yourself?"
I did.
I didn't have any hazelnuts.
"I mean, you're supposed to wait a little while, make sure you're ready."
Uh...we should go.
"Lulu, Alvin wanted me to tell you he's gone to the track."
"Hey, do you have a second?"
Yeah. I'll be right there.
I think that Alvin's trying to get me to fire him.
Do it.
[sighs]
- Are you busy with that case?
- Yeah.
"Well, I heard that woman died when you were there."
"I mean, I didn't think about your mother."
That's not important.
- l should've thought about it.
- l'm fine.
"Well, I'm sorry, Nick, to have to send you there."
Thank you.
Ready?
"One, two, three."
"One, two, three."
"One, two, three."
One--and make a little turn.
And that turns into a box step.
- Hi.
- Hey.
"No, don't stop."
"That was excellent, sweetheart."
She's learning the fo_rot as well.
"Oh, great, great."
"So, you want to-- you want to dance?"
- Burton.
- No?
That cave...
I feel cold.
That place... it is strong with the dark side.
"Mm, a domain of evil, it is."
In you must go.
What's in there?
Only what you take with you.
Your weapons... you will not need them.
"Yeah, whatever."
"What's good, Robert?"
!
What's really good?
!
Aah!
"That's right, Robert!"
I'm you!
Aah!
"I can't believe you going out like this, granddad."
"Nigga, hush!"
"Uh, yes, I-I just want to make sure that the sergeant know it's Robert Freeman."
"I'm at the mall, and I'm gonna be attacked by this crazy nigga at any time."
Okay?
So they're on their way?
"Okay, just making sure."
"Granddad, you do this, you really gonna be a bitch-ass nigga."
"I mean, I shouldn't be surprised 'cause if I Google ""bitch nigga,"" I'll find you, but damn!"
Ow!
I'm afraid to show my face!
"Hey, look who's coming."
"Go home, old man!"
You're a loser!
- [Cheers and applause
Come.
Panju.
Who is it?
Manoj?
Yes.
"Yes, that's me."
And you are?
We are coming from Kanyakumari police station.
We want some details.
Is there a problem?
Shall we talk inside?
"Okay, come in."
Who has kept this here?
- Don't change it's position...
"If you change it, he will get hurt later."
Thanks.
And you are?
He has come with me.
Take your seat.
Tell me.
The car parked outside...
Is it yours?
Yes.
You have changed the windshield of the car on the 19th.
How did it break?
Why do you want to know about that?
A small enquiry.
Tell me.
Some drunkards pelted stones on it as I'd parked it outside.
So I covered it and parked inside later.
You seem to have changed the glass in a hurry.
Small shards of broken glass pieces are still there.
I can't tell.
"-Hey, where's Lenny?"
"-Right here, Woody."
"Oh, no, I can't bear to watch one of these again."
"Oh, no, it's a Combat Carl."
What's going on?
"Nothing that concerns you spacemen, just us toys."
I'd better take a look anyway.
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
"That's why, Sid."
Sure is a hairy fellow.
"No, no, that's Scud, you idiot."
That is Sid.
-You mean that happy child?
-That ain't no happy child.
"He tortures toys, just for fun!"
"Well, then we've got to do something."
What are you doing?
Get down from there!
-I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson.
"-Yeah, sure."
You go ahead.
Melt him with your scary laser.
Be careful with that!
It's extremely dangerous.
He's lighting it!
He's lighting it!
Hit the dirt!
Look out!
Yes!
He's gone!
He's history!
"Come in, please."
I know you.
"No, I do not think so."
Yes.
"In the university, you helped me to put fiancee in a taxi, you were very amiable."
You decide to me very well.
Why have you come?
"I will see, I..."
-You want that I take a look at you?
truth?
-Yes.
I am very badly.
"Please,"
Get undressed.
-Also...?
-Yes.
Lie down.
tell me?
what happens to you?
"I have you feel nauseous, fatigue, lack of appetite."
We are going to auscultate the heart.
You seems to me a little excited.
This tightens much to me.?
It matters to him?
Please.
Thus I am more comfortable.
We see.
"Yes, very it is excited"
It excuses.
"Nowadays, the bra, they make them very small."
Thus it is well?
We are going to see where hurts to you.
Hello?
"Look, you tell me, and I'll tell her."
Even the phones don't work.
"Your sister says you've had an offer of £87,000 for your house in Brighton."
"87,000?"
Give it to me.
"Don't be a fool, Stephanie."
"92,750 I said, and I'm not taking a penny less."
You tell him that.
Why don't people listen?
Well?
"Well, let's scrub that 32p then, shall we?"
Let's enjoy ourselves.
"Oh, thank you very much."
"Oh, Major!"
Major!
"Um, can I have it now?"
"- What, old boy?"
- The money.
The money I gave you last night?
What... what is all this about?
You remember I gave you some money just before you went to that remembrance service?
- Remembrance service?
- Yes.
"I don't remember that, old boy."
It was for a chap you didn't like.
"You know, he was..."
one of those...?
One of those what?
Well...
Pansy?
Yes.
"No, it's not."
So now you're gonna be a gentleman?
(WHISPERING) Giants can smell blood.
And I'm always a gentleman.
(CORK POPS)
(CORK THUDS)
(GASPING) Ah!
What the hell is that?
It's rum.
Bloody waste of it.
(EMMA PANTING)
Here's the plan.
We wait for the giant to fall asleep.
"When he does, we'll sneak past him into his cave."
That's where the treasures are.
Where the compass lies.
And then?
And then we run like hell.
I don't have time to wait for a giant to fall asleep.
"The powder Mulan gave us, we need to use it."
We've gotta knock him out.
That's riskier.
Than waiting for a giant to fall asleep when we need him to?
Point taken.
"Ooh, you're a tough lass."
You'd make a hell of a pirate.
"Who's Milah, on the tattoo?"
Someone from long ago.
Where is she?
She's gone.
Gold.
Rumplestiltskin.
Why not?
is it problematic?
"Come on, Christine, we're both adults."
Herman is so...savage.
He doesn't beat you?
"No, in bed I mean."
What does he do?
He just pounds away.
And he comes at once.
"No wonder, that boy is crazy about you."
"Yes, but there's nothing in it for me."
Zilch!
Doesn't he repeat the exercise?
Falls right asleep.
Tough.
Perhaps I can help you.
How?
I'm psychic as you've noticed.
Get that boy down here.
I'll apply my gifts to see why he comes so quickly.
- l could possibly cure him.
- That would be wonderful.
"- Oh, but he's in Germany."
- l'll go and get him...tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Good girl!
Up and at it!
"You're lying on something sharp, look!"
Didn't you feel it?
"No, there's a numb spot on my back."
Strange...
Clean sheets?
I didn't come back to the house ever again.
I haven't seen her or the kids since then.
Thing is I don't exactly remember how that fight begun.
But that's not important.
You've been married and you'll underst...
-Careful!
Hey!
I found a big fridge full of food!
I told you!
Ramón keeps the house ready for everything.
It's downstairs.
Do you want to see it?
No.
What are we eating?
-Are you hungry?
No.
Do you like the house?
-Yeah.
Have you seen the soccer goal?
What are we going to do?
Nothing.
Goal!
It's your turn now.
Now you.
I did know that Clara would talk about us.
About our relationship.
About how was everything.
But I didn't expect what she said.
Did she talk about me?
You weren't the point.
-The point was you two.
"Yeah, us..."
It's just the end of the quarter.
You remember how that was.
But I am earning double time.
There's a bright side.
"So, when the laziest boy in the world wakes up, tell him he better wash those sneakers."
"And I said ""Bye."""
And tell him to let them air dry this time.
I don't want them banging the hell out of my dryer.
What?
"What, you don't even get casual Saturday?"
"No, it's just you..."
You look nice is all.
"It's work, Walt."
Everybody's gonna be there.
Ok.
Maybe we'll order a pizza tonight?
Ok.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hi.
"You've reached Walt, Skyler, and Walter Junior."
"Please leave a message, and we'll get back to you."
Skyler?
Are you there?
I... don't know what to do.
I need to talk to you.
"Hey, Marie."
It's me.
What's up?
Yesterday I got home and found him.
He didn't even tell me he was coming.
- A man was killed?
"Hi there, Billy, how ya doing?"
Glad to meet you.
I heard a lot about you.
"Oh, here."
"I'll take it, it's my mom's."
Okay.
"Well, uh, how was your trip?"
Fine.
"Uh, did ya sit by the window?"
Yeah.
"Billy, tell Mike what you saw."
"I don't know, a bunch of clouds."
"Billy, come on, you saw the Grand Canyon."
"Hey, hey, you saw the Grand Canyon?"
"We're going to see the Grand Canyon from the ground, up close."
"Really, it's one of the most spectacular sights in the whole world."
So is Central Park.
Are we going to spend our whole vacation here?
"No, I'm with you, come on."
Wait 'til you see the trip I got planned for us.
- You're going to love it.
- I hope so.
"Listen to me, I'm telling you this city has grown a whole lot since you've left here."
"- I can tell, it's amazing."
"- Oh, yeah."
"I sell some lots, you know."
I sold some parcels out here.
I've contributed to its growth.
- Really?
"- Oh, yeah."
"- Big, big lots?"
"- Oh, yeah, oh, huge."
"Okay, Jenny a-and I, we're looking to have a new nanny."
"Or in Tyler's case, a... a manny."
[Laughs]
- What?
- Yeah.
[Both chuckle]
Stop it.
"You're, like, the worst liar ever."
Who is this guy?
He's Lanie's new boyfriend.
She wanted me to check him out but not to tell you.
"You know what this means, right?"
We... are gonna have some fun at Lanie's expense.
"Hey, Lanie."
I got your text.
And I've got your murder weapon...
"A picture of it, anyway."
I used the autopsies of The Phantom's victims to generate this.
Ryan:
Hmm.
Those serrations near the base are pretty distinctive.
Exactly.
Find the knife...
Find the killer.
Nice work.
"So, how's the background check going?"
"Oh, pretty good so far."
I don't like the sound of that.
"No, t-there's..."
there's nothing to worry about... y-yet.
It's... it's just a rumor.
Let's hear it.
This is what I'm talking about.
What is up with you?
Nothing.
It's just...
Fresh margs!
This is some weak margarita.
Whatever.
You're the lightweight.
"Oh, ho, ho, say it over here."
Come here.
I hope your parents never come home.
"Seriously, dawg, let's find that punk's trailer park and burn it to the ground."
Who dat?
That freak from Chino.
He was all up in Luke's grill.
Maybe he's on OxyContin.
OxyContin is gnarly.
I heard he's like a total psycho.
He's a little bitch.
"I see that kid around again, I'm going to beat his ass."
"Yeah, run him out of Newport for sure."
I gotta go.
Hey wait up.
Where you going?
I can't be here right now.
What's the matter?
You don't know him.
You don't know anything about him.
He could be anywhere.
"Dad, I'm sure Ryan's fine."
We should just try again when it's light out.
Could be too late by then.

Right?
"Well, I haven't played as much paddle as I used to."
That's not exercise.

I'd meet the children of the woman I portrayed...
Do you know where he is?
Maurice?
Why?
Do you want to tell him that Jonah's dead?
It'd kill him.
If he's still alive he's probably in Marseille.
The last time I saw him was in Marseille years ago.
"In a restaurant, of course."
"I actually remember the restaurant. ""Beirut""."
"Lebanese food, nice restaurant."
But that was long ago.
Do you have a picture of him?
"No, I threw it away."
Or tore it up.
You know how a broken heart is.
You do all sorts of things that you regret later-.
Be a little like me.
How?
I don't even know who you are.
Just tell Ricky the truth.
"Get rid of the cigarette, there's no smoking here-."
You talk to me about truth...

Do you know what they're using that money for?
"They're feeding refugees, building houses."
You guys don't help anyone!
We help you.
"W-we help you, and we helped you save that money."
Please do not roll your eyes at me.
You can show me some respect.
"Paige, you started lying to us..."
I didn't lie.
"Well, you certainly don't seem to know the difference."
Do you?

You lie.

Emergency signal from Fred.
What happened last night...
Was he on his way to tell me that he loved me?
What should I do if he wasn't?
"Gil Da Ran,"
I love you.
He was probably going to say it like that to you.
Alright then.
Is that so?
"It would be so, right?"
"If it's like that, I worried uselessly."
Like a fool!
"Yeah, yeah."
Like a fool.
Let's pack up your clothes!
This color suits Yoon Jae very well.
This color is good too!
This one matches well too.
"Here, go pack it up."
I'll go get a bag.
Does she like Seo Yoon Jae that much?
"Aish, what's this?"
Are these the keys for this house?
No.
Is it the contracted room for us after we get married?
What should we do?
"Wait a moment, and go answer the phone naturally."
What?
Hello?
"Oh, Yoon Jae."
- It's Se Young.
- So you were home?
- The doctor friend that you saw at the hospital.
I was so worried because you didn't answer your phone.
A medical friend?
-Why it interests so much to you?
-Or a medical friend?
And if outside thus?
"So that by your part, we have finished."
You were wanted who it.
"In agreement, but I can run?"
no?
-Until the shutdown of the street car.
-In agreement.
"It starts, damn it."
-It does not start?
"-No, it does not start."
First you invite to me and soon it does not start.
You had to fail to me indeed now?
Eh!
taken care of!
-I do not touch myself.
"We go, Lella, only a little."
-No.
For here.
-Let go of the hair. let it go!
- You will never change.
"We go, only I have requested you a little kiss."
-You kiss with the hands.
"-But, only with one."

Yes Big Boss.
- Give one to him too.
- Yes.
I don't have money.
I didn't ask for it.
I'm as old as your father.
Take it as my blessings.
Here.
Take it son.
Hey boy.
Won't you thank the Big Boss?
Offering water to the thirsty is a good deed.
And you've earned a merit because of me.
So should I be thanking him or will he thank me?
I must admit.
He's no ordinary boy.
Because he talks about common sense.
I forgot Lallan.
Even a bag of rice has pebbles.
And you Dushyant.
Why don't you setup a cracker-shop?
Maybe you'll do good business?
You made a big mistake... taking up enmity with Dushyant.
No guns.
I'll hack you to pieces with this axe...
And all of North India... won't be able to put you back.
Hey boy let's go.
Stop.
Hadn't you better catch him up?
You don't want him taking the hump again.
"Oh, lord, he could be anywhere."
I'll see you at Popmobility.
Thanks for everything!
Bye!
Bye.
"You'll have to take the lift, love."
"Oh, flip."
It's all right.
You don't have to fling me into the gutter by the seat of my trousers.
It's not the Beano.
"Quick as you can, boys."
Up over there!
Who is it?
Sir!
"It's Jimmy Baker, he's up on that ledge."
Everyone shush!
"He's too late, though, isn't he, sir?"
"Because he didn't come on the tram, sir."
"Climb over, jump down, I'll catch you!"
Look lively.
Is everything all right over there?
Get in your place!
"Yes, thank you, Sir Hamilton."
Baker was just helping me up.
"Lost a leg, sniper, Vimy Ridge."
Good man.
I was Naval Reserve.
North Sea.
Lot to be grateful for.
You said Baker hadn't turned up.
-I didn't say a thing.
What you can be sure is I'm not telling you the whole truth.
Tell me about Daniel.
-Daniel?
Yes.
Don't think I've forgot.
I told you he's 18 and he's studying economics.
I know that already.
What else?
Don't think I know much more.
Then when you meet...
He says:
"""I'm 18 and I'm studying economics."""
He doesn't have that voice!
And you answer him:
"""That's nice!"
"I like you."""
You're so foolish.
You guys must talk about something.
-Yes.
"A lot of things, sure."
Can't you tell me anything?
I wouldn't know how to repeat them.
Right.
I'm your father and we can't talk in the same way.
No.
We can talk the same but no.
It's not the same.
It's different.
I can't figure this out...
What?
Nothing.
It was just a question of time.
"Shall we go, son?"
Now?
You wouldn't want to worry Mama.
"No, I wouldn't."
Take good care of him.
"Oh, he'll be taken care of."
I don't want to go.
"Why, Wilbur?"
"Yes, tell her why."
"Well, because, you see, I'm not really a little..."
I like it here.
I want to go to school here.
This is a girls' school.
That's why I like it here.
"Now, Wilbur, you mustn't hurt your father's feelings."
"You wouldn't do that, would you, Wilbur?"
No.
You know how sensitive I am.
He's very sensitive.
"You're choking him, Mr. Hoolick."
Oh.
(COUGHS)
"Come along, son."
You don't have much time.
"It's been nice meeting you, Mr. Hoolick."
"It's been very nice meeting you, Mrs. Brendan."
"Goodbye, Wilbur."
"Don't say that, Mrs. Brendan!"
"All right, you."
Where is it?
Why did you tell Mrs. Brendan you're my father?
"and on top of that, my little timmy has a black eye for the christmas portrait this year because harley was too busy saving your butt, instead of walking him home from town."
"and i'm sorry i said ""butt."""
okay?
don't say that.
mommy is mad.
- bob!
are you gonna say anything?
!
"- she does have a point, cind."
- [scoffs] fine. fine.
[sighs] you know what?
"i don't need any of you guys, okay?"
"and, peepers, i'm really sorry about your eye."
- is aunt cindy mad at me?
"[door slams] - it's okay, honey."
just -- just eat.
"let's just wash the day off of us, okay?"
none of this happened.
[siren wailing]
- [sighs] hey!
what are you doing here?
"- oh, uh... nothing."
"i'm just -- um, just, uh, cutting school."
- oh!
"well, you seen wayne?"
- no.
why -- why would i have seen wayne?
- 'cause he works here.
"- well, um... yeah."
"no, i... i haven't seen him."
- okay. cool.
"there you are, my little worker bee."
This was a dream come true.
I'd landed a custom '66 Mustang.
There you go.
All right.
Thank you.
[ Engine turns over ] There you go.
I knew I had to go easy on her if I wanted a good tip.
But I had to take a shot.
How drunk are you?
[ Laughs ]
"Had a few, I'd say, at least."
[ Engine revs ]
"Oh, I will have you home in no time, my friend."
Done.
[ Laughs ]
"I don't want you to baby this thing, all right?"
You have nothing to worry about.
Seriously.
[ Both laugh ]
"Oh, that's sweet."
This was great.
"If I could just keep him happy and not wreck his car, a healthy tip would be in my future."
Don't baby that clutch.
Come on.
Give it a little gas.
[ Engine revs ]
[ Tires screech ]
Perfect.
[ Laughs ]
There's no way Rutledge was having this much fun.
You're the best driver that I have had yet.
Wood:
It's an Audi.
Give me that.
How fast does it go?
"I don't know. 140, I think."
What fish are they?
They're meant to be sharks.
But I think they're sort of catfish.
Do they cost a lot?
"Yeah, they cost $100 billion."
"""Smoking kills."""
"Thank you for that, cheers."
I'd forgotten.
"You know, Will, you've got a nice flat."
Thank you.
"Only one bedroom, though."
Largely because I find I can only sleep in one bed at a time.
You could get a bigger place.
"I mean, if you needed to."
"Would you like anything to drink, Marcus?"
"Thanks, just got a Pepsi."
Who are these people with the saxophones and trumpets?
Saxophonists and trumpeters.
Why have you got pictures of them?
'Cause they're cool.
What's cool about them?
I don't know.
They took drugs and died.
A vowel.
"""A."""
- And a final consonant.
- And a consonant.
Thank you.
Johnny was she sleeping with him?
"If I'd have seen something like that, I would tell you."
You think that maybe he was just an old friend?
That's all there was?
We didn't talk.
He didn't seem impressive.
I handed him an envelope.
- He wasn't?
- No.
He's gone and he knows not to come back.
"You know, that would be just like her."
"You see, you know, always looking to help someone."
"I'm dying, John."
- You okay?
- Yeah.
"It's gonna be okay about this guy, so forget about it."
- I let Jimmy down.
"- No, you didn't."
He's gonna die now...
- ...and he thinks I don't love him.
"- Listen to me, he knows you love him."
"And all he wanted was a little more time, where it didn't hurt so bad."
And he's gonna get it.
WEXLER:
Robin?
Yeah?
WEXLER:
You got my soup?
KELLY:
"Go ahead, you'll be fine."
"Yeah, Jimmy, just a sec."
[HELICOPTER BLADES whirring ]
- Do me a favor.
"Finish this beer upstairs in my office, quick."
Huh?
Higgins is here.
It's after 6:30.
"If he catches you in here without a jacket, he's gonna string me up alive."
"No, he won't."
What?
"I can guarantee ya, five gets you 50, he's gonna lay that old line on me that he's on the board of directors."
He's gonna tell me to throw your butt out of here.
Money's up.
[ Sighs ]
You're on.
"Hi, Hig."
And how is your investigation progressing?
"Oh, not too well."
- Are you sure there's nothing more I can do to help?
- [ Rick ] To help?
No.
Positive.
"Well, if there is anything, please don't hesitate to ask."
- Put Magnum's beer on my tab.
- I always do.
- Tomorrow at 3:00?
- I'll try.
Thank you.
You believe that?
"You're catching flies, guys."
Give that guy a drink.
?
[ Lounge Piano ]
?
Oh.
Marissa?
Look who's here.
Luke!
Hi.
Hey.
Mm.
Just grabbing a little grub before we take the boat out.
Boat?
"Yeah, I thought we'd take my dad's DawnSea."
"Do a little water skiing, have a little lunch."
So you have no idea where Ryan might've gone?
I don't know.
He did say something about going down to Mexico and gambling on cockfights.
"I mean, I don't know what kind of jurisdiction you guys..."
Quit joking around.
Will you answer his question?
"Yes, I did."
I really don't know.
I do not know the guy.
I never got the chance.
"Hey, there's eggs."
"Oh, I'm taking Caitlin to the stable, so I need to get that check."
Does Caitlin really need a pony?
"In a couple of months, she's not even going to like horses."
What?
!
I love China.
She's the prettiest pony.
We're not giving up China.
"Now go wait in the car, sweetie."
Mommy will be right with you.
You want to see the way little boys kiss?
"Well, that's nice, Wilbur."
This comes a little later.
Now cut that out!
What's wrong with you?
"Oh, oh, nothing's wrong."
I was just trying to show you what I shouldn't do.
"Well, that's right."
That's what you shouldn't do.
(BELL RINGING) No.
"Well, I..."
I must go.
"I hope you won't forget our little talk, Willy."
"No, I won't forget, Aunt Nancy."
(DOOR CLOSING)
"Goodbye, Uncle Bob."
"Now, wait a minute."
I want to have a little talk with you.
"Oh, oh, I can't."
Natalie has me until 4:30.
Natalie can wait.
Why don't you straighten up?
"Oh, I am straightened up."
It's just that my shoulders are stupid.
"That's funny, I got stupid shoulders."
I have to go.
"Now, look."
It's possible I could have had you all wrong.
Had me all wrong?
"Maybe you are a nice, simple, warm-hearted kid after all."
"Yeah, and a loyal, trustworthy pal."
That's right.
Kelly?
- Kelly Donovan.
- Jen!
I heard you were back in town.
Used to babysit me.
- And then I used to party with her.
- This woman is crazy.
- Not as crazy as you.
- Not anymore.
"- Well, sit, drink."
"- Uh, I shouldn't."
"I'm responsible now, haven't you heard?"
"- Take a night off, it's good for the soul."
- Great for the soul.
"Oh, wow."
- This is not gonna end well.
- Can't wait.
I hate this house.
It's better than the tomb.
I didn't stay locked up for 145 years to end up locked up here.
Maybe you should quit complaining.
- You gonna stop me?
"- Let it be, Frederick."
- You heard what Pearl said.
- I don't care what Pearl said.
"What you got, boy?"
Try that again.
Back off.
Back off.
- We don't fight each other.
- I want out of this house.
- Why can't we go into town?
I don't care as long as she's lucky.
Is it too much?
You look great.
Excuse me.
"New girl, new girl."
You're off your mark.
My mark?
Yeah.
"The big ""X"" on the floor."
Look where I'm pointing.
Oh.
90 seconds!
90 seconds?
Wait.
"No, no, no."
I don't have a script.
Excuse me.
I never got a script.
There is no script.
This is the lottery.
"For the love of God, if there was a script, we'd all be rich."
God.
Amateurs.
Captain.
Lieutenant.
How is the investigation going?
"Well, we're just getting started."
"Spoke to the staff, the camera crew, everybody said they left the building after the show."
They usually do.
"Well, somebody was here."
The girl didn't stab herself.
You wanted to know if Marissa received any fan mail.
""" Love is a virus... that infiltrates itself... in the system of two lovers."
"Yours, Gary"""
"He didn't sign off""love,"" but there are two ""loves"" before."
"It's good, no?"
Remember me?
Of course.
My public defender.
"- Beautiful, isn't it?"
- What?
Far out.
Can I try it?
Far out.
I need to tell you that I love you
I could win or lose you
But I need to tell you that I love you
Beautiful.
You have mine.
I have yours.
Miami I can get you for $7 50.
It has to be New York.
Can I just buy a one-way ticket?
There's a flight with stopover in Paraguay for $650.
$650...
It's still a little high.
"No, thanks."
You can't get a hotel in New York for less than $7 0 a day.
I'm staying with my boyfriend.
- He has a loft in Soho.
- Can't he lend you some money?
"No, he doesn't know me yet."
Your boyfriend doesn't know you?
No.
It looks like there's some tidy minge here.
"Yes, it's tidy because there's no hair on it."
"Oi, Si, Hannah Fields is over there."
It's her who write your Valentine?
"Oh, yeah, shit."
She looks quite fit actually.
"Right, I'll go over and tell her you fancy her."
- No.
- Why?
"Well, you going over and telling her I fancy her, seems a bit, y'know, childish."
When in Rome.
That's how you got to play it with younger girls.
You go over...
"Shit, she's coming over here."
So did you get my valentine's card then?
"Oh, yeah, great."
Thank you.
- Do you want a drink?
- I've got one thanks.
"No, I mean a proper drink."
Oh... right.
"Yeah, thanks."
You're fit.
- Sorry?
"- Oh, forget it."
Come on.
"You're well sexy, I used to stare at you in assembly."
Right.
"Ooh, you're so horny."
Tongue me!
"Um, how old are you?"
"Blimey, that didn't take long."
"The will, adding me to the company."
He's been lying to both of us this entire time.
Who is that?
I don't want to sell this house.
Me neither.
"Wait, stop."
- What is it?
- Mm.
Oh.
I just thought we were good.
You're right.
It's too soon.
Sorry.
You should be.
For thinking I want some lame missionary position.
"There's just something about bedroom sex that's... so predictable, you know?"
"So... so ""old married couple."""
I'm just a girl who's more into... surprises.
You're right.
Beds are for sleeping.
We were married?
I had no idea.
Oh.
"Oh, don't stop."
Don't stop.
Don't move.
Shit.
Who is it?
Hope this isn't a bad time.
"The phone, Adriana."
"You need something, call."
But then I wouldn't get to see your beautiful face.
"I don't think you are, Dad."
"You know who's in there, right, besides the little girl?"
Her mother and her father--Charlie.
That means he knows.
And that's two people with a lot of information that have had some pretty bad experiences with us over the years.
They have to go.
"Dr Penzler, too."
I can't risk a leak.
It's too important.
They don't matter anymore.
It's all about Allie.
"You're not in charge here, Mary."
I am.
Take a step back.
Calm down.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
"Just, the two of them having gotten together has made me a little nervous."
- They could really gum us up.
"- No one's getting killed here, Mary."
Of course not.
CYNTHIA:
I got to go to the bathroom.
Grab a cup.
Knock yourself out.
"Lisa, hows he doing?"
He's still breathing.
Are you all right?
I just don't want any more bad news.
Mr Watson?
"Luke, when he died, he wasn't mad at you anymore."
DALE:
Or you're just acting blind to the truth that we're husband and wife!
And the way to Bela is the only thing I remember.
Can't you understand that?
"I don't want to understand it because I'm so tired of you, Migs."
"Well, I'm tired too."
I can't take it anymore.
One more chance?
I will change.
"If I would keep you hoping, you'll get hurt even more."
"Migs, I need you."
I'm begging you.
-I'm here for you now.
-What are you doing here?
.
This is wrong.
-Wrong!
-Wrong?
.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
My heart and mind says you're the one I love.
You're the one my heart is screaming out.
"But what if, what if your memory comes back?"
How?
What if the accident really happened so I can come back to you?
.
I don't want to get hurt again.
Don't be scared.
Don't be scared.
What did she say?
.
"Hello, this is Joy."
You named your battleship after your assistant?
Yep.
"They're both cold, heartless war machines."
"Your tea, sir."
"Look, I am truly sorry for the mess I caused."
Let me make it up to you.
Take Zhu Li.
"My battleship, it's yours, and everything on it."
"It's not the fleet we were looking for, but it's the next best thing."
All right!
Team Avatar is back in business!
It's okay.
We're gonna stop Unalaq and get Jinora back.
I hope my dad's all right.
I'm sure he's fine.
Get the men and fall back.
What about you?
I'm going to end this right now.
Go!
"Hello, Tonraq."
Looking for me?
"Brother, I'm too strong for you."
You're no brother of mine.
You betrayed me.
You had me banished.
"Yes, I did."
Stop!
He's mine.
You are not the true chief.
I am.
And you will bow to me.
"Now that I've defeated you, your daughter is next."
The war is like a time bomb for everyone who stuck their neck out.
How did you recognize me?
You said my name right away.
Your voice.
It hasn't changed.
"Like in the past, when you'd brief us before we'd go."
I'll visit again soon.
Maybe with good news.
"Whatever you'll do, good luck."
"The children would say ""Mazzel and broche""."
Ok.
Thanks.
More chicken and we're also out of orange juice.
"Ab, come on."
-Orange juice.
I like to have a full fridge.
In case something happens.
What happens?
-Anything.
War.
-You and your war.
There.
-Thank you.
Juice.
And juice.
I called you at the office earlier.
-I wasn't there.
And you weren't there yesterday or the day before yesterday.
That's true.
I was away for work.
-But they didn't know where you were.
Jealous?
"Hello sis, how are you?"
"I'll go to your house later, okay?"
.
"Sis, are you okay?"
.
They really are close to each other.
Who?
Migs and Bela.
I'm not used to seeing them like that.
"Sis, be strong."
Fight for Migs.
"You know, show Migs why he fell in love with you."
I just find it so hard every time he sees me but he doesn't remember me.
But I can't make it obvious.
I have to hide it.
-It hurts so bad.
"-Sis, you can do that."
I have to carry on.
I'll show him why he loved me.
Take a bath.
"You know, this is where we had our second date."
And you always take something home for Raya and Mrs. Robles.
That's why Raya loves you so much because you always bring her food.
-It's because you keep bribing her.
-Is that so?
.
-Who were you talking to?
-It's Ara.
Later...
"I'll go to our house, I'll just get something."
-Do you want me to go with you?
.
Kevin.
I'm Frank.
Brad.
-Hey.
"-Oh, hey."
"Oh, God."
"Come on, come in."
Excuse me.
What do we do now?
Just ask her to...
you know.
You kids see a lot of hookers?
"No, this is our first one."
Why do you have a picture of Grace Kelley?
'Cause I'd like to be like her:
Marry a prince and never get old.
"When you take your clothes off for money, do you get cold?"
Depends on the room.
"I have this dream that I'm naked at school, and I have to get home without anyone seeing me."
"I have that dream, too."
"Last time I had that dream, there was an alligator chasing me."
You ever get that one?
Nope.
Do you ever watch cartoons?
Yes.
Are you married?
"Boy, you ask a lot of questions."
The meter's ticking.
She's on the bed.
She's on the bed!
"Now, how do you want to do this:"
standing up or on the bed?
Ahem.
"Okay, you're not helping, really, with my nerves here, so I gotta go."
Goddamn it.
"Hi, I'm Lucy Miller."
Um...
You must be Maggie.
I'll be representing you.
"I brought warm, comforting beverages."
Or what's left of them.
The rest is on my new white shirt that I wore to impress you.
"Uh, can we sit?"
Great.
Oh.
Sorry about your chips.
Um...
"Look, uh, yours is not a hopeless case."
Seems pretty hopeless to me.
Hm.
I can see that.
I'm not saying it's going to be easy.
They do have your son's voice on the 911 call.
I don't even know what happened to me.
I didn't mean to scare him.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
"You know, um, I'm scared too."
You're scared?
This is my first day in the field.
That's comforting.
I volunteered.
I specifically wanted your case.
A charity case.
Because I think I can help you.
Is that what you want?
"If we stay around here, we're dead."
You got it?
We're dead.
They're right.
You took too much of that stuff.
You're totally paranoid.
How's he doing?
Busting his balls or what?
He's okay.
They sobered him up.
Good.
Very good.
Glad to hear it.
You know what kind of questions they're asking him?
"Jimmy, I don't know."
I got my mind on so many other things.
I got no money...
The girls are old enough to read the newspapers.
Tell him he's got to call me.
Okay?
"As soon as you talk to him, e's got to call me."
It's very important.
He doesn't know I came here to see you.
It's like he's crazy.
- Take this.
It's a couple of thousands.
"- Thanks, Jimmy."
"Don't worry, everything will be all right."
I got some beautiful Dior dresses.
You want to have them?
Pick out a few for yourself.
You're right.
Poor Dori.
Dori!
He's running faster.
Great!
Dori.
Did you kick me?
"No, I was just running."
What's wrong?
I don't know what's happened.
It's weird.
What's the matter?
Are you in pain?
I think it's a muscle cramp.
Can't move at all.
Really?
You can't move?
No.
"Dori, come here."
"Oh no, what shall I do?"
It's very swollen.
The doctor really said you don't need to be looked at?
"Yeah, he's my relative so he wouldn't lie."
He said an unused muscle snapped.
We have unused muscles in our body?
I don't know.
Maybe it's like an appendix.
He says it'll be very painful only for a week.
Lucky I don't have to go to the hospital.
But shouldn't you see a doctor at least once?
Is talking on the phone enough?
Don't worry.
A clown ba...
It's like a baby...
It's like a clown that is a baby.
- I said cl... clown baby.
- Mm-mmm.
You said baby clown.
- I don't even care.
- Yep.
"""Clown Baby""?"
What in the hell kind of a name is Clown Baby?
"Bro, it's perfect."
Nobody's gonna bet on a guy named Clown Baby.
He's gonna be a huge underdog.
- Which means we stand to make even more money off him.
- Exactly.
"- Oh, that's brilliant."
"- Hey, pal, 500 bucks on Clown Baby."
"Oh, Dennis. 500?"
"That's all we got, dude."
You saw Charlie.
We turned that kid into an animal.
"Oh, yeah?"
Call me a Holocaust victim?
Say you're prettier than me?
"Okay, maybe that part might be a little bit true."
We'll see how pretty you are as soon as I punch a hole in your...
Wha...
Where the he...
Who took my shit?
I might have had some.
"What did you just say, you little bitch?"
I might have had some of your pills or whatever.
"He's got a couple of fractured ribs, maybe his sternum too."
Set up for a chest tube.
Pratt.
"Trauma panel, type and cross four units."
- He could've bagged his spleen.
"- Look, I'll get the other one."
- We need you here.
- We'll be there.
"- Now, Gallant."
- It's cool.
It's not cool.
Hurry the hell up.
"- Come on, let's go."
- You've got two doctors.
That's enough.
We've got a critical patient who needs rapid assessment and prompt treatment.
What's the matter?
Forget what happened earlier and do your job.
- I
- I can't help that guy.
"- This is what we do, all right?"
"Now, get your ass in there."
Come on.
Come on.
"John, it's beautiful."
Absolutely beautiful.
Marriage can be a great thing.
- Can be.
- Yeah.
What the hell do I know?
Mine failed.
For many reasons.
Biggie was as rough as you're now!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
Don't come back without the money!
"""Pochilam"""
Which one is Huang Fei-hung?
- Excuse me...
- I'm the king fu instructor for the navy!
What do you want?
Are you blind?
Just wait a second please.
No!
Please.
Sit here.
Let me examine you.
"Don't hurt me, or I'll beat you up!"
You want a fight?
That's fine with me.
Stop!
That's no way to treat a patient!
"I as just arranging your seat, Master."
What's wrong with you?
I feel uncomfortable from head to toe!
I'm Huang Fei-hung.
I'll examine you.
Let me warn you first.
I've crippled several of my doctors!
Your pulse is weak!
Can you do something about it?
Of course!
No problem!
Back to normal now!
"We're on an island, all alone."
"Look, we appreciate the imagery and all that, but this is no time for existential metaphors."
No.
Really.
The pier's been washed out.
"Summer, you're okay !"
I am so glad to see you.
"Hey, where's Ryan ?"
He's...
Hey.
"Hey, Atwood."
I got to look for Pancakes.
"Oh, my God !"
Pancakes !
I'm gonna go with you.
Great.
"While you guys do that, Ryan and I will, uh..."
Go.
"Yeah, we're gonna go."
Where are you gonna go ?
"Yeah, we just got here."
"Well, we need supplies."
I have supplies.
"No, I know, but, uh, who knows how long those will last."
"Yeah, and there'll probably be a run, especially when the zombies come out."
Seth.
Ryan.
"Look, guys, we'll be fine."
"Just stay here, lock the doors and don't open them."
"Summer,"
Pancakes needs you right now.
Be careful.
I just wanna walk.
How is he?
"Well, he's doing pretty good, considering."
Do you think she ever really loved him?
It doesn't look like that matters.
"- Breathe, Harriet, breathe."
- I am breathing.
We need to come up with a better game plan for that next contraction.
You're doing just fine.
- Let's just have a look at you.
- Okay.
You're going to feel a little pressure.
A little pressure might be a nice change.
Where's Dr. Gettis?
He was due in here 10 minutes ago.
- I don't know.
I paged him.
- Get him in here.
- What is it?
- I need you to roll over on your side.
- I need Dr. Gettis right away.
- Okay.
Get that pillow down.
Yes.
- Don't push yet.
- What's happened?
Just something the doctor needs to look at.
They can't find him.
I've got Dr. Chadway.
"Doctor, we have a prolapsed cord."
The baby's heart rate is showing decels.
"Yes, sir."
Wow!
Add one goldfish.
"Oh, no!"
"For him, time has stopped."
Is it dead?
No.
Watch carefully.
"Now, he's in the future."
He leapt through the time he was frozen.
"No, that's not right."
"On TV, time machines go zoom..."
"Yeah, up and back between past and present."
Correct.
And that's what I'm studying.
"Follow me, please."
I'll show you an amazing trick.
I'm going to make this Pikachu disappear.
Wow!
What did you do?
It's gone.
We created a mini black hole ...at the micro level.
It's called a worm home.
Where'd the paper go?
"First, it became incredibly small."
"Then, crossed dimensions, ...and came out of another hole."
Where's the other worm hole?
Wanna see it?
What if he kidnaps us?
You've got your cell phone.
No service.
Isn't he a weirdo?
That's only what my Dad said.
-I have an appointment!
What is happening?
Go and look.
"Maestro, I have something special and he won't let me come in."
-You cannot pass!
-Go away outside.
I have something truly exceptional.
"See, show the maestro."
Show it to the maestro.
-What is going on?
-Can't you see?
I only see a cheeky one.
"-In other words, two of those."
-Look at it maestro.
"Well, look at it."
Is it not a loveliness?
Show it.
Show it to the maestro.
-Congratulations!
- What did I say to him?
Doesn't she at least deserve a test?
"Yes, I don't know."
Perhaps.
At least it deserves the proof of the currency.
Show me how you move.
Pick it up.
Is it like this?
Or is it so?
Well you have a future.
"So says someone, who knows."
-Thank you maestro.
-Then you make her a star?
What are you doin' here?
You're gonna miss your race.
Don't worry.
"I'll give you a police escort, and we'll make up time."
"Thank you, Sheriff."
But you know I can't go just yet.
"Well, why not?"
I'm not sure these tires can get me to California.
- Peet stop?
"Yeah, does anybody know what time Luigi's opens?"
I can't-a believe it!
Four new tires!
I can't-a believe it!
Four new tires!
"Grazie, Mr. Lightning."
Grazie!
- Would you look at that!
- Our first customer in years!
"I am filled with tears of ecstasy, for this is the most glorious day of my life!"
"All right, Luigi, give me the best set of blackwalls you've got."
No!
"No, no, no."
You don't-a know what you want.
Luigi know what you want.
Blackwall tires.
They blend into the pavement.
But-a this...
Whitewall tires!
"They say, ""Look at me!"
Here I am!
"Love me. """
"All right, you're the expert."
She thinks she's doing her job.
I am going to pull him from her class.
Don't overreact.
The agency said there was gonna be emotional scarring.
"Hey, give it back!"
How could you like to be his parents?
Where are my baby fish?
Mr. Michaelson bought them for his aquarium.
They were mine!
They were grown up.
It was time for them to have their own home.
You had no right to sell them!
"- Mikey, what's wrong with you?"
- They were mine!
Calm down.
They were only fish.
You don't care about how I feel.
You don't love me.
I hate you
Calm down.
Stop it.
"When Daddy gets home, we'll talk about it."
He's not my real daddy.
You're not my real mother!
I hate you!
I wish I never met you!
"Mikey, wait!"
( Door Slamming )
I'm sure there's an explanation.
If we could just get him to talk.
I don't know.
Maybe they're right.
That's hilarious.
Get me some soup.
Yep.
Uh-oh.
"Thequestionis ,willthe  House pass the bill as amended?"
This is a 15-minute vote.
"Oh, my God."
My ass is killing me from that shot.
But I feel pretty good.
Really?
- Ma'am.
- What?
"Oh, boy."
Here we go.
It's like I want my baby to live.
I don't want my baby to die.
"Maybe think of it more of as a bill, which in a very real way is what it is."
- Mm.
- There's Pierce.
He even walks dumb.
"Every time I see him, I hear circus music."
"Come on, Owen."
"It's your time to shine, you dim fucking bulb."
- He voted no.
We lost the vote.
- Oh!
We are victorious in defeat.
We may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing.
"Okay, so I lost the vote."
I won by not winning.
"God, I don't know how I feel."
"Apart from, like, having a raccoon take a shit in my head."
You still want to play charades?
Yeah.
I got to go.
(laughs) Really?
Mm-hmm.
Parker.
"You know, I can help you, Doc, with your ex."
(chuckles)
"No, you can't."
"Oh, yeah, I can."
I need to go home and check my judgment.
It's about Wickes again?
You were right about the tell.
He looked at that photo for a reason.
"Yeah, he did."
That's not enough.
"So, you were wrong about the guy."
No one here likes you any less.
"I want to stop running, Gibbs."
Really see the people around me and not just blurs as I fly by.
Really see them.
I just don't know if I can.
Not yet.
"I'm here, Doc."
I know.
(clears throat)
"== sync, corrected by elderman =="
Previously on Dance Academy...
Our problem is with your kind.
You're a second-year in a first-year leotard and we don't like the second-years.
"Even if there was a moment, we've probably missed it, so there's no point in..."
I owe a lot of money.
I can't pay him.
Pay who?
A loan shark.
Why?
Because I wanted to get my family out of here.
I didn't want my daughters in this town anymore.
You borrowed money for your daughters?
Stop...
What's wrong with you?
What is it?
What's wrong?
Two months ago I found a brick.
At the Point.
A brick of what?
Tobacco?
Heroin.
You know what that is?
How much did it weigh?
One kilo.
What did you do with it?
I sold it.
What did you do with the money?
I spent it.
On what?
The car outside.
Do you think that's why they killed your daughters?
I don't know.
They came here for their money.
"They took the washing machine, the fridge, the television..."
"If I don't pay, they'll take the car and the boat."
We'll have to move away.
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.
I didn't mean--
- Don't bother.
It's not worth it.
What do you think?
It's not very good.
It's not very...
Buckley.
"It's not your fault, you know."
It really isn't.
"You'd better go home, Mrs. Cole."
Exterior train.
Station.
"A full moon, a clear sky."
A man sits by the shore.
There has been a quarrel.
A woman is walking away from him.
Now she turns back.
"""I didn't mean what I just said."
"And, anyway, you said worse."""
It was a declaration.
"- ""Stupid bloody fool"" was good."
Did you think of that beforehand?
"Are you trying to pick a fight with me, Mrs. Cole?"
No.
What I'm trying to say is that... if all of this stopped... the sparring and the jibing and the insults and the arguments...
I'd miss it.
"Even if I were dead,"
I'd still miss it.
The Catrin Cole School of Dialogue.
On and on and on and on and on.
I totally forgot to order it without peppers.
Yeah.
Even though I told you seconds before that I hated green peppers.
- My head still must be a little fuzzy.
- Must be.
So what kind of food does Bo like?
- Nothing special.
She seems like someone who'd like a good steak.
- Maybe.
- What's Bo's favourite restaurant?
We don't really eat out much.
...We..?
- Yeah.
"""We"" this, ""we"" that."
"You're pretty much right in there with Bo, huh?"
"Right by her side, day in, day out."
Yeah.
"You know, we're kind of a team."
Is that healthy?
"I mean, don't you want to branch out on your own one day so that both of you can flourish?"
- Yeah.
"You know, you're totally right."
I'm actually planning on going back to school and getting my law degree.
"Oh, law."
- That's so great.
- Yeah. it's so great.
- Gotta pee.
- Okay.
"Oh, jeez."
"On, shit."
"Oh, my God."
"On, God."
I told them not to come.
There wasn't any point if you weren't there with me.
[soft guitar music]
A girlfriend!
"Hey... oh, right."
A girlfriend among us!
We have been infiltrated!
Hello. [laughs nervously]
"Oh, my bros, my bros, my bros!"
This place is too dope!
They can't let it last!
There's only one option left.
Get the Kool-Aid.
[men cheering] Yeah!
Now mix it with the vodka.
"Quickly, now."
"Shots, my bros!"
It is the only way.
[slamming podium] We must do shots!
[men clamoring]
"Shots, shots, shots, shots!"
"The younger bros first, then the eldest."
Do you want to get out of here?
"Well, you... you don't want to hang out with Mike anymore?"
Uh...
"Oh, mother, mother, mother, mother, please."
"No, let's..."
let's go back to my place.
- Okay.
- Um... ♪ ♪
Let's go back to our place.
- Okay.
Plus he's scared shitless of me.
We pay four large.
Cost of business.
Take it out of his payroll.
"And it's only his first dealing rap, so worst case scenario?"
"They plead him out, he does five months picking up litter in an orange jumpsuit."
So who goes inside?
I don't need them seeing my face.
"Well, I don't need them seeing my face."
Why not?
You look like his typical clientele.
Dick.
Fine.
We'll flip for it.
Call it.
Heads.
Mayhew?
Mr. Mayhew?
Mr. Mayhew.
Nice of you to come down.
Please.
Look at you.
Should I call the FBI and tell them I found DB Cooper?
Joking.
"Please, come on."
Come on.
Please.
Hello.
Saul Goodman.
Please sit.
So it's a shame that we have to meet under these circumstances.
I believe you have something for me?
Still want to take Barry's place?
"- Get out of here, Barry."
- I'll go get a teacher.
You want to go?
"I'm not gonna fight you, Dirk."
Why not?
You chicken?
Come on!
No.
Get up!
Get up!
- Come on!
Get up!
"- Hey, get back!"
Get back.
That is enough.
"So long, Barry Cook."
You all right?
Barry was my friend.
I just burned his bones.
"Well, he's at peace now, Sam."
"I mean, if dad had let us stay just a little while longer, maybe I chould have helped the kid, you know?"
You read the coroner's report same as me.
Barry was on every anxiety drug and antidepressant known to man.
School was hell for that kid.
His parents had split up.
He just wanted out.
"It was tragic, but it's not your fault."
"To tell you the truth,"
I'm glad we got out of that town.
I hated that school.
It wasn't all bad.
You were the last one to see him.
Did you give him the suicide weapon?
-Me?
To commit suicide?
I'm from the insurance.
-That clears you.
Our company doesn't provide this service yet.
Excuse me.
Give me.
What was wrong with him?
Was he an alcoholic?
"No, acute leukaemia."
He only had a few weeks to live.
He was very scared.
Scared to tell his wife and afraid of total decay.
He couldn't handle the final weeks.
That's why.
Bang.
"This isn't possible, guys."
If only it had been a few days later.
Now we've been liberated.
Dorien.
Did I age that much?
-Ab!
I recognized you right away.
You didn't change a bit.
What a surprise.
Come in.
Were you working in the garden?
"-Yes, shall we sit there?"
I just made tea.
-Alright.
"If anyone asks, say we're looking for treasure."
Imagine I ask you:
"- ""What are they here for?"""
- Treasure.
It could mean trouble.
Not at all.
What a beautiful village!
"Yes, it's very beautiful."
You've hidden it well.
We haven't hidden it!
The ancestors built it here.
It was them then!
They built it like this so no one would steal it.
"Tell me, why do you think they built it here?"
Because I wasn't there.
You weren't here before then?
Did you arrive recently?
I think the car has a problem.
It's stalling.
It struggles on hills.
The gauge isn't working.
"Yes, it has a problem."
"Farzad, get out."
- ls there water here?
"- Yes, over there."
"Get out, guys, and check the car."
Try to find out what's wrong.
Has your car broken down?
Our car?
It's given up the ghost.
Meaning?
It can't go on.
I slipped on banana peel in alley way comin' back.
Let's go see about those dresses.
How are you girls holding up?
Fine.
Fine.
We're out of bullets again tho.
Why don't you use one of those guy's guns?
They seem to have plenty.
Why the hell didn't I think of that?
These guys got everything Daze!
Even a little Glock for your purse.
You know the blue one?
It's like Christmas!
I got you...
Sucker!
Take your pick mister.
Why don't you decide?
"Okay, let's see..."
"I'm gonna go with the .38, Daze."
"Alright, are you ready mister?"
Sure.
Okay.
Here goes nothin'.
Hardy har har.
What?
Are you done yet?
Come again?
"I said ""Are you done yet?"""
What are you talking about?
"You weren't serious you're gonna do it, were you?"
I most certainly was.
With that piece?
I think I can stand that.
[Greta snarling]
DAVE:
Scrub right here.
[Shower running]
[Monique gasps]
What the?
Oh well.
"Hey, this isn't so bad."
[Monique giggling]
"Dave, what's that?"
[Doorbell ringing]
I'd better see who it is.
I'm gonna check the breaker box.
The breaker switch jumped off for some reason.
"Hey, who was at the door?"
MONIQUE:
"Whoever it was, they left."
"OK, Richard."
"Stand there by the front, over there"
A little closer to the center.
That's about right.
"OK, now, I'm gonna kick the car out of gear."
"OK, you got it."
Can you hold it?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I can hold it."
I'm not gonna push it far off hill though.
"Well, uh, tell you what, now."
What I want to do is to kind of ease up on it a little bit.
"Like, you know, let it... as if you"
Were gonna let it roll forward and pick up a little momentum.
"I'm sorry, Mr Devereaux, but we get a lot of cars here and it's hard to keep track..."
- You mean the car is here now?
"- Oh, yeah."
It's right outside.
"They stole it right offthe street from you, huh?"
Goddamn.
"You're gonna have to pay the towing charge, you know."
"I was told these things happen in New York, but one never expects it."
"Yeah, well, that's New York."
Is this your first trip over here?
Yes.
"Where's my car, please?"
It's right over here.
You're lucky this time.
It's in perfect shape.
Not a scratch.
You must lead a charming life.
Henri.
Je vous attendais.
Let's go!
I wouldn't be surprised if I'd been followed.
"- Listen, I'll see you at Pop's tonight."
"- OK, babe."
Take care.
They got the bridge blocked off!
This is the police.
You're surrounded.
Come out with your hands up!
This is the police.
You're surrounded.
Give 'em the gas!
Hold your fire!
"Yes, Miss First Lady."
It's in my pocket next to my heart.
"You know, Mary Todd gave it to Lincoln to remind him he only had so much time to do good things while he was in that chair."
- I hear you.
"Well, kiss Amber for me, okay?"
I love you ladies.
Miss you.
- I gotta go back to being president.
- I love you too.
Did you know that 1.5 million people visit the White House every year?
"No, I did not know that."
"Look, I'm sorry."
I'm sorry that I didn't make it to your talent show.
I'm not.
Seriously.
Did you know the White House used to be called the Presidential Palace?
"Look, I need you to hear me right now."
Look at me.
I really wished I was there.
"No, you don't."
All I-
- All I did was twirl a flag.
It was stupid.
"You know that you don't have to do that with me, right?"
- What?
- Have thick skin.
You're 11.
- Good morning.
"- Good morning, sir."
- How are you?
"- Fine, thank you."
Yourself?
New York City.
"Relatives, you know."
Yeah.
"Well, you have a good time, anyway."
- Yes.
Is that my cheque?
- That is your cheque.
- Good.
"- Thanks, Saul."
- Shalom.
- Have a good time.
- I wonder how long he's been planning that.
- I don't know.
You heard him.
"Lena's been planning, he's been postponing."
"Hey, my new tux is in here."
He didn't even mention it. it's not on the bill either.
She must've really been anxious to get on that vacation.
I'm goin' that way.
"Come with me, pay him and we'll say goodbye to Lena."
"OK, that's a good idea."
- Here.
This'll keep you honest.
- Mac.
Will they keep the shop open while they're on vacation?
They might have someone part time to take orders.
Out of business?
"Hey, brahda."
Bet you'd like a ride to Diamond Head.
Ten bucks round trip.
Ten bucks?
"No, thanks."
I bet you anything he's well hung.
How do you know?
Did you see him?
You want a cookie?
Of course not.
You can tell from a guy's face.
And especially from his crotch.
I've got a sixth sense.
"He's friendly with Benigno, isn't he?"
Yes.
"He isn't a faggot too, is he?"
No way.
Are you nuts?
Are you insinuating Benigno's a faggot?
I'm not.
"It's vox populi, honey."
You're very wrong.
Dr. Vega confirmed it for me.
How would he know?
Alicia's father told him.
"I don't approve of him being so intimate with the patient, but Dr. Vega told me not to worry."
"Benigno doesn't like women, he's into men."
My God!
I'll leave so you can carry on pulling him to bits.
The poor thing likes Benigno.
"Good choice, sweetie."
Hey.
"Hey, Benigno."
I'm free tonight.
I'm going to the Cinematheque.
Want to come?
I'm meeting my editor.
What can I do then?
I got an idea.
What is it?
I can guarantee success with my idea.
- Your Highness will have to be patient.
- Why?
"If you can be patient,"
I'll guarantee you'll have the books of Chin Kang Fist and 8-divine Sword.
Brother!
What is it?
Fung-wu killed his master!
He killed his master?
How can it be?
How can it be?
It's true!
Fung-wu's master was playing chess with His Highness.
"Suddenly, he held a sword in his hand and plunged it into his master's body."
That's unreasonable.
How can it be?
I saw it myself.
His master told him before he died that he'd done the right thing.
Done the right thing?
That's strange.
What happened afterwards?
His Highness arrested him for murder.
Did he resist?
It was useless!
He's helpless!
"Yan-ling, don't be sad!"
I'll find out the truth.
"1, 2, 3!"
"1, 2, 3!"
And I am not apologizing.
My past isn't about you.
"-Oh, that is cold."
"-No, it's not."
It's clear.
"You're gonna keep me in my place, are you?"
I'm not gonna keep you anywhere.
You are free to move around.
"Well, I'm not moving, for your information."
"You can work your tough-girl thing, but I know you're in love with me."
That's irrelevant.
"Kind of tired, babe."
You know?
-You're up early.
"-I know, and I'm not happy about it."
-You need some Valium?
-I don't wanna get back into that again.
"Yeah, that wouldn't be good."
Try swimming.
It helps.
-So how are you?
How's work going?
-Good.
-Just not sleeping enough myself.
"-Oh, I'm sure."
-Hospital's been busy.
"-A lot of psychos, huh?"
"No, just a lot of pained souls."
"Listen, I appreciate your interest in Alex."
I meant to tell you that.
I really like Alex.
I like her a lot.
"Oh, mate."
That'll be a little surprise package I've arranged for us this evening.
"Without wanting to give the game completely away, they're twins, from Macedonia and..."
.. they don't have keys.
You - out.
"Laters, bro."
- Mr Douglas.
- Calum.
"- Oh, no."
- John Mercer!
I'm not staying here.
Where was it you shared the cell?
"Pentonville, wasn't it?"
- I'm not staying here.
The lad's an idiot.
- That's a bit harsh.
"Granted, he's no Stephen Hawking."
"- John, mate, don't be like that."
"- Don't ""John, mate"" me, please."
- I'm not staying here.
- You don't want to live with him?
Fine.
Get rid of him.
- John!
- What are you doing?
This way you get the flat to yourself.
"John, mate, please, I've changed a lot since then."
"I'm sorry about that deodorant, mate."
"Just tell him you'll stay with me, please."
John!
Please!
Don't...
Hi.
"Terribly sorry, officer, but this is actually my car."
I'm...
"I'm trying to, uh, teach my girlfriend how to drive stick."
She's got a lot to learn.
I know.
"But, you know... women."
"All right, I hear you."
It's a warning... this time.
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
"What are you, some sort of a misogynist?"
You're welcome.
"Oh, go."
We got lucky.
"""We""?"
"This isn't your car either, is it?"
Hmm?
I stole a stolen car?
Now how about that drink?
(Engine starts)
(Birds chirping)
"All due respect, I'm the best-equipped to go."
- How many wars have you been through?
- My share.
- It should be me.
- You?
You haven't fought in a battle.
This is about us getting home to our loved ones.
- Why would you...
- Because I have no loved ones.
"If I fail, you can still go on."
-Aliens.
What?
-All this for nothing.
They abandoned us.
"Folks, the sea is frozen."
It is impossible the aliens return.
Frozen hard.
Frozen hard.
"If the sea is so far, we will take as food."
"Than before die hunger, too."
-I better go.
-We can not let them.
-I think they'll leave.
-It seems that we ...
"I must inform you that the Adelie, not help us anymore."
And who will bring us fish?
"Some good questions, has no good answer."
"Sven can not leave us, not now."
"I'm sorry, fofuxo."
If they also get no longer be alive.
I can not stand ...
Do not take it anymore.
Get away from me.
I'll leave.
-That crazy guy!
Me too.
We girls let's jump.
"Sven, teach them, teaches them to fly."
Erik is not so easy.
Help them Sven help them.
"But not all Penguin is equal, Erik."
But you're a penguin.
(PHONE RINGING)
Hi.
So are we doing something tonight or not?
I can't.
My girlfriends are sleeping over.
I'm having a sleepover.
This is like the first normal thing I've done since I got pregnant.
"All right, well..."
Just let me know where I fit in here.
"Okay, I'll talk it over with Jody and Francine and I'll let you know."
(SCOFFS)
I'm just joking.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, not funny."
And...
You know what?
This isn't going to work out.
I have to go.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
"No, I have to go."
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
"And I don't like your friends, either."
They're not nice.
What does that have to do with anything?
They're still my friends.
We'll see.
"Yeah, we will."
Boyfriend problems?
He thinks my friends aren't nice.
And why would he say that?
Because they aren't.
But it's high school and you have to have friends and these are the only friends I can get right now.
My job with you always comes first.
I promise.
Come on.
We've got a million things to do.
Okay.
We've got to talk to the publicity people and set up a photo shoot.
Natalie.
I hate that picture!
"I like the other one better, the one on the trolley cars."
What do you think?
I don't know.
"Oh, my God."
It's so weird seeing myself on a bus like that.
"I mean, I can't believe it's really me up there."
I can't believe this is really happening.
"I can't believe it, either."
"I hate to bring this up, but we have work to do."
"Remember your predecessor, Marissa Kessler?"
Murder victim?
Multiple stab wounds?
Does that ring a bell?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
All right.
Randy and the Captain are probably already there.
It should be just around the corner.
It's number 24.
24. 24. 24.
Are you done?
Sorry.
Let's do this.
What's the guy's name again?
I just got so nervous.
- You were great.
- It's like a tax on the stupid.
"Come on, Randy."
We're parked out front.
Good job.
"Well, thank you, mr."
Monk.
- It was fun.
- Yeah.
I'm glad you did it.
What a fun thing to do only one time and never try it again or mention it again.
"Natalie, where you going?"
"Mr. Lawrence, I told you I wasn't an actor."
I'm so sorry.
Sorry about what?
That you did such a terrific job?
The phones are lighting up like crazy.
They love you.
And those little ad lib things you did.
You were wonderful.
Wasn't she wonderful?
So...
what do you say?
- About what?
- About doing it full-time.
It's just three nights a week.
I promise it won't interfere with your day job.
"I mean, I don't know."
You really thought I was good?
I told you when I met you you're a natural.
Mr. Monk?
"Look, I don't..."
I don't care.
Shut up.
Get in here.
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.
- Pull down your pants.
- What?
Don't ask questions.
- Shove these in your underwear.
- Why?
You want me to do it?
"'Cause, I swear to God, I will."
- Why can't we leave it in the bag?
- Because it shows up on the scanner.
"And we're not about to have them confiscate $250,000."
"$250,000?"
- No.
Why do I have to do it?
- 'Cause you're the donkey boy.
You really suck at not asking questions.
What's a donkey boy?
"- Step forward, sir."
- Thanks.
"- In the basket, please."
- There's a table when you get to the line.
"Act casual, think casual, be casual."
"Remove your keys, any metal objects."
"Laptops out, please."
Thank you.
"If you have liquids in a Ziploc bag, please show them to us now."
- Thank you.
- We need to smash things all over your body.
- Yes!
- No.
- Yes.
- We need to build up your tolerance to beatings.
- Hence the smashing.
"- We used a trash can, but Dennis wanted to use a chair."
- I think he's ready.
- That's way too excessive at this point.
- That guy's ready.
- He's not ready for a chair.
"- I'm tellin' you, he's ready."
Hey!
Guys!
I can handle a chair.
Go get a chair.
See what you're doing to him?
You're getting him all worked up.
- He's the toughest guy we know.
"- Yes, he is, but he..."
"Hey, Mac!"
"Get a chair, smash it on my back."
That's the right attitude.
He's got the right attitude.
I'll tell you what.
"Charlie, go put on those little short-shorts."
- Let's take things to the next level.
- Yeah.
- But first things first.
Let's get good and drunk.
- Let's get drunk!
- Whoa!
"Hey, let me get two more."
And one for my buddy.
"Oh, man, you remember this?"
How could I forget it?
Good times.
Good times.
Good times.
Good times.
Yeah.
"Hey, you wanna get your sidekick under control?"
"Robbie, chill out, man."
It's $200 if I gotta recover that table.
You gonna pay for it?
"Yeah, I'll take care of it."
"Robbie, this isn't American Bandstand."
Get off the table.
"Come on, man, you're disrupting this whole establishment."
"Hey, man, you know what's good for your health?"
Get off the table.
"Police officer, put the gun down."
Hey.
No problem.
No problem at all.
"Lay it down, pal."
"Sonny, relax."
"Now this little guy didn't mean it, right?"
"Robbie, let me handle this."
Robbie!
Back off.
You never pull a gun out unless you're planning to shoot somebody.
You got it?
"Yeah, I got it."
Sure.
"- Hello, Ed."
How are you?
Why haven't you called me up?
Why...
Uh...
Our phone's out of order.
"- Well, you could have come to see me."
- No.
"No, I couldn't."
"You see, the girl I'm engaged to wouldn't like it."
So long.
"Say, was he trying to insult me?"
"Oh, no worry about that."
It's nothing.
You know the old saying:
"""Is just as many good fish in the ocean as there ever was. """
Fish in the ocean.
"There she is, boy."
Give her the gun.
"Yeah, what's the hurry?"
"Well, they told us to step on it."
You know what Joe says.
They got enough orders to paper this shop.
Oh.
Dombrowski said.
"Hey, what's the matter with you?"
- That's the fourth drill you've burnt up.
"- Well, what's it to you?"
Dombrowski's trying to sweat a record out of us.
"Listen, Frank, get down to work and quit knocking Joe."
Let her down.
We could've missed something.
All right?
"Look, here's the plan."
We're gonna...
"Um, start a fire in the kitchen, and it'll distract them."
Then we'll run.
There is no plan.
What are you gonna do with that?
I don't know.
I shouldn't have borrowed that money.
"No, Blair, this is not your fault."
Okay?
It's not.
All right.
Two kids come back from Christmas break.
"The first kid says to the second kid,"
I had the best Christmas ever.
"Got a new XBOX with every single game for it, a new bicycle, season tickets to my favorite basketball team."
What did you get?
"Second kid says, I only got a sweater."
"First kid says, why."
Second kid says...
"It's because I don't have cancer, Jimmy."
I know you're scared.
"No, it's..."
Actually kind of funny.
I'm pregnant.
What?
Oh my God.
I'm not.
I...
I just wanted to know what it would feel like to say that.
How do you know?
I
Were you there?
It was tricked by lights guiding it into the rocks.
- To cause a shipwreck?
On purpose?
- Of course it was on purpose.
Shut up.
You know very well there are no wreckers anymore.
Who knows?
The tide may have washed up the bodies.
I asked you if you were there.
- What about you?
Were you there?
- Me?
No.
I was herel
"So, why have you got blood on your shirt?"
You're crazy.
There's nothing there.
God curse the wreckers!
The sun is rising over the shore!
A sad and gray day!
The tide is out!
I can see two small figures.
They are getting up!
- They start walking.
- That's enough!
- Shut up!
- They are still weak.
They support each other and stagger forward.
Be warned.
- Mwah!
Oh!
Mwah!
[Chuckles] Wait till I tell the ladies.
"- Okay, noon."
Noon.
"- Oh, ladies?"
Ladies!
What the hell?
What's that about?
I just wanna give them what we have.
What we have is 500 miles to drive.
"Yeah, but we came and we disrupted their lives, and I just feel like we owe them something."
"Yeah, we actually do..."
$230 for a night's stay.
Or how about you can support me on this?
I think it's disgusting.
Whoa!
What?
The two of them together is just gross!
It should be illegal!
"All right, I'm done with this."
- Come with me.
"- Dad, help me on this!"
"I'm not gonna help you, you little bigot."
Let me show you something.
See that crazy old man right there?
- He comes here every day...
- Hey!
To protest the love in this house.
"Yeah, and he's right."
Certain people just don't belong together.
It's written in my notebook right here.
See that?
"""It looks like her number came up."""
Let's see your notebook.
I didn't write it down.
I just thought of it.
"Please, come on!"
Can you believe this guy?
You know what?
"I'm gonna have your badge, officer Kil."
"Come on, Shecky, let's walk it off."
Excuse me.
I'm Stan Lawrence.
I'm the station manager.
- Here's that list you wanted.
"- Great, great."
I'll make sure they get it.
How long did she work here?
Not long.
Just a few weeks.
I still can't believe it.
I should've put more lights back here.
"No, you can't blame yourself."
It was after midnight.
The parking lot was empty.
More lights wouldn't have made a difference.
"Thank you, officer."
That's very nice of you to say.
I'm not an officer.
I work with Mr. Monk.
Is that Adrian Monk?
I've heard of him.
- A sandwich?
- Do you want to make me a sandwich?
honey.
you know I will.
Hey.
what's up?
- How's it going? but it's tomorrow.
set it up.
Are you sure?
Are you sure you can fit it in between your little palettes there?
all right then.
I'll pick you up at noon.
Get your ass back to work.
I need a word with you.
- What is it?
- l need some time off.
nothing like that.
Drake booked another fight.
It's tomorrow.
good.
Of course.
Of course.
Take the week off-- protecting my investment.
I appreciate that.
tell Todd I hope he's feeling better.
- What do you mean?
- You haven't heard?
That Victor kid kicked the crap out of him.
His mom said he worked him over really good.
When the fuck was this?
I guess.
I thought you knew.
We got from now on to celebrate.
"- I'm not hungry, Mrs. Grogan."
- You've got to eat.
All you had for lunch was a can of tomatoes.
Go on and eat.
"- Oh, don't worry."
I'll be over this tomorrow.
- You will if you stay home tonight.
- Yeah.
"- Never mind, I'll get it."
Hello?
Oh.
"Just a moment, please."
"Ed, it's for you."
Mrs. Danvers.
"- Thanks, Betty."
"- You're welcome, I'm sure."
Hello?
"Hello, Eddie."
"Oh, I'm fine."
I just wanted to find out how you were.
Huh?
"Oh, gee, that's too bad."
"Say, it must have been the gin chasers."
It couldn't have been the beer.
"Oh, I just called up to tell you I'm not mad about what you said last night."
No.
"Well, you know, about our not having any more dates."
"No, I've forgiven you already."
Uh-huh.
I couldn't stay mad at a swell guy like you.
"Well, that's fine."
- Lucy...
- Yes?
"Lucy, I..."
"I don't know what you're expecting tonight, but I..."
I...
I think you should know that...
"Mama, I do know."
"Goodbye, Mother."
"Goodbye, Daddy."
Bye.
"Billy, you missed your tea."
"And you, Faber."
Have something at the pub.
- Thanks.
I'll just have a wash.
- See you there.
"- Freddy, can I come?"
- I don't know about that.
- You in the army yet?
- Tell him about that miracle cream.
"Oh, yeah."
Will you tell Mrs Garden I'll be late?
My mate Harry's got this cream that takes all the pimples off...
"Mr Faber, I've kept a nice piece of meat pie warm for you."
- We mustn't let that go to waste.
"- Not with this rationing, we mustn't."
I'll be down in a minute.
"24 hours isn't very long for a honeymoon, is it?"
We can start right now.
There's a bottle of bubbly down there.
So there is.
- There we are.
"Master Y an, Master Zhou has been slain"
The body is lying outside
"Dad, don't know who did it this time?"
"Brother Y an, you see!"
You see!
Who killed him?
Who killed him?
Who did that?
"Brother Y an, what should we do?"
"That's right, Brother Y an, what should we do?"
What should we do?
Let's go!
"Go, go!"
"Wait, it'll be dangerous for us to stay here!"
What do you mean?
"If we stay here, we'll be killed all the same!"
I guess we should leave tomorrow!
T omorrow?
Now!
The bad guys of the boxing world
"I'm sorry, did I scare you all?"
How come everyone is here?
You want to flee?
Leaving Y an Qingwang here all by himself?
He'll be lonely!
So it's you!
It's too late now to know!
No wonder you look like a pig!
"Y an Qingwang, why are you so late?"
You should've come sooner to see my act
"You bastard, since you're here!"
My brothers died suddenly
"Please, come in."
We can do it like this.
I wouldn't like to bother you.
I have a plea for you.
- For me?
"Please, come in!"
Let's not stand here.
It's maybe inadequate.
The thing is delicate.
"They're not dangerous, aren't they?"
No... please come.
"Sit, please."
You just speak.
I don't know where to start.
Excuse me...
Have we met before?
No.
I wouldn't say so.
"You see, this is a bit..."
Would you rent me a room?
Me?
- Yes.
Have somebody send you to me?
"It's a mistake, then."
"No, I come by myself."
I heard in the neighborhood that you're a loner.
"I'm a loner, too."
"I was living in Trešnjevka, Gorjanska street."
It's a very similar street to this one.
So I thought...
I know Gorjanska street!
"You see, I was living there for two years, and now I got fired."
I envy you. with the nonsense that comes out of their mouths...
Makes you wonder the whole point of it all.
Shit.
Don't worry.
We won't need it.
Stay here.
Mr. Munson.
What brings y'all this way?
Why don't you ask your boys? right?
I have an easement with the previous owner of your property.
Huh.
Bullshit.
"Previous"" being the operative word."
Who's this?
Just a guy telling you to get back in your nice truck.
Go play Okie dickhead somewhere else.
Carl it looks like Mr. Munson hired some muscle.
Looks that way.
He's a friend of mine.
A friend with a big mouth.
I hear that a lot.
too.
More than I'd like.
Then you know the drill.
I'mma count to three and you're gonna start walking away.
I got rights to this water.
One.
I have a lawyer now.
Two.
- Three.
- Ah.
Ah.
What's it take to get a menu here?
"Okay, I'll handle it."
That's all right.
I'll handle it.
And ruin your popularity?
"You know what, why don't you guys just sneak out the back?"
What's going on with you two?
Hey!
How's it going?
Hey!
Front door.
Hi.
"Hey, guys."
How you guys doing?
"You like the food here, too?"
It's pretty awesome.
"Shut up, queer."
"Well, at least I don't shave my chest."
What'd you say?
"Luke, come on."
I just said you look nice in a sweater vest.
It was a compliment.
"Do you want me to break you, Cohen?"
Hey!
No way.
Look who's back.
"You know, you're a little far from Eight Mile."
"Luke, don't!"
"What are you, like spokesperson for geeks of America or something?"
You know what I like about rich kids?
Nothing.
That was awesome!
That's how I ended...
That's how I ended up here.
My God.
That's why I'm here.
He was right.
Who was right?
You saw Leek.
- He was part of the warning.
- What?
He was part of the warning.
"Stop, stop, stop."
I didn't want to scare you.
He said...
He said the messages are real.
Something terrible is gonna happen.
"Connie, please."
We have to leave here now.
I will not live my life like that.
I will not make decisions based on messages from Indrid Cold.
He may be real to you.
He's not real to me.
"Okay, I'm going to Charleston."
I'll be at the Marriott.Get yourself reassigned.
I don't want you anywhere near the plant today.
What if nothing happens?
What if there's no great tragedy?
What'll you do then?
- That's not the point.
"- Well, I think it is the point."
- Gordon believed what he heard too.
- I am not Gordon!
I know.
Leave Ringo alone.
Who the hell are you?
Let her go.
"Wait, you're him?"
Ringo...
You really are beautiful.
Mister...
You're Casshern!
No doubt about it!
They say the Ruin will stop if we eat you.
"Well, that story's too dumb for me to believe."
"But, I understand why some would want to believe it."
I've never seen a body as brand new as yours.
"But I'll never get to see it again, once I smash you--"
What are you...?
!
Mister...
S-Stop!
Don't.
I don't... wanna... die...
Ohji...
Stay away.
I don't believe my eyes.
Crying in sadness as you bid farewell.
"I thought it, but now I've seen your true colors myself."
Your ability to kill like that is impressive.
Yours is the lowest form of existence!
It always has been.
Do you know my past?
Enough to know that I want to kill you.
Tell me.
What am I?
I don't want to let them down.
"No, of course not."
"Well, I leave on Monday, and I'll be back in London for the exhibition."
I suppose it's not so very far off.
"No, it's not so very far off."
And I'll come and visit as often as I can.
"Right, then."
Veal's off.
I've ordered cutlets Milanese... and semolina... pudding.
You are Mr. Ambrose Hilliard?
Yes.
"I'm Sophie Smith, Sammy's sister."
Ah.
His office.
"Last night, he was working late."
It was bombed.
They have asked me to identify him.
I am unable.
Mr. Hilliard?
Mr. Hilliard?
"I'm afraid, my dear, someone has made a mistake."
I almost did so myself.
"You see, Sammy Smith has two fingers missing from his left hand."
"I'm sorry, we try very hard to... to make a whole person."
For the relatives.
Oh!
Is it him?
Is it your friend?
My agent.
Yes.
That's him.
"You can stay with us, if you like."
"Oh, God."
"Oh Albert, I love you."
Do it this way.
Oh yeah...
Oh Albert!
(wistful cello music)
That'll be nice.
You can pick me up at the airport Charles de Gaulle...
Anna!
I met this guy...
"I look forward to work with you, too."
"No, I talked with them yesterday."
Thank you.
"OK, goodbye."
Au revoir.
- I met this handsome guy at the gym.
- So Albert is history now?
No.
"But he needs a place to stay, so I said my flatmate was going away."
"That's fine by me, as long as you take care of it all."
"Thank you, God!"
This guy will make your mouth water!
Tell Mr Mouthwatering that he can rent my room while I'm away.
He can pick up the keys on Saturday.
I love you!
If I'd known the true identity of this Mr Mouthwatering -
- I'd never have said yes.
- I know a trick.
- What's keeping him?
- What if he can't find it?
- Relax.
He's smart and he's gorgeous.
bob?
bob?
[baby crying]
- have you seen tim?
- no. why?
- he isn't here?
- i don't know.
i just got here.
- why don't you ever know anything?
- i... i know she's -  he might not even -  hey.
you're all here!
come on. come on in.
- honey.
"oh, honey, what happened to your hair?"
and where are your glasses?
"- look at me, mom."
i'm cool!
"- i don't understand why she -  can you calm down, you beast, okay?"
his haircut ain't gonna cost you nothing.
"it's a freebie, and i can't believe i'm even saying that."
all right. hop down.
[grunts] - aah!
"- i think you might still need these, though."
come here.
- this is lovely.
"yeah, he's got it."
"- so you just remember that cool comes from the inside, okay?"
mwah!
hee-haw!
- how did you pull this off?
- let's just say that... mama made me do it.
"- mama, can we open our presents now?"
Right now!
Geez.
It's 11:29 at the tone.
Bing!
That's 56 minutes.
That's my best time yet.
"And I know I could do better on the road, because this last stretch of beach is all soft sand."
"What do you think this is, a gymnasium?"
"Hey, man, you stay in pretty good shape, huh?"
About how many miles do you jog a day?
Only eight.
Eight.
Hmm.
Mm-hmm.
"Uh, you swim a lot too, huh?"
Now and then.
I bet you can ride a bike pretty good.
Bicycle?
"T.C.,"
I am not in training to enter the Iron Man contest.
Honest.
A guy'd have to be crazy to do that.
"First you swim five miles, then you marathon 26 miles, then ride a bike a hundred miles all in the same day."
"Yeah, this is Rick."
I bet you could do it.
No bet.
Okay.
"Thomas, that was Jimmy at the gate."
There's a woman here to see you.
This has gotta stop.
"I mean, as Higgins would say, this is a private club, not an office."
Not an office.
My aunt was a Grimm all these years.
I didn't even know it.
Look.
I can show you film right here that will blow your mind.
[Door closes]
Juliette!
I know how this sounds.
This is why I didn't want to tell you.
This is why my aunt told me I shouldn't be with you.
"You need to talk to somebody, Nick, but it's not me."
"Juliette, I'm trying to explain."
Okay.
"Okay, remember that hair you found on the horse when it was attacked?"
You couldn't figure out what it was.
That is what I'm talking about.
You need professional help!
"No, Juliette."
"Look, yes, I understand why you're saying that."
There's one more thing I can do to prove to you--
"- Nick, please."
"Stop, okay!"
- You're really scaring me!
- I don't want to scare you.
I just want you to know the truth.
Come with me.
Just give me this one last chance.
"Hey, Nick."
Juliette.
What a pleasant surprise.
I think.
Come on in.
All right.
Why aren't you in uniform?
It doesn't fit me anymore!
He must be a right fucking bastard!
I know what I'd have told him.
He blushed.
You should've seen him.
"Just 'cause I said ""toilet."""
"Is he good-looking, Sharon?"
"Ah, you're joking me."
You know Roland the rat?
"Well, he looks like him, only not as nice."
"He asked me why I wasn't wearing me uniform... so I stuck out me belly... and I said, ""It doesn't fit me anymore!"""
"You were dead right, Sharon."
You should've stuck one of your tits... in his mouth as well.
You should see the state of me nipples.
Jesus.
"Frank Kinsella's a ride, isn't he?"
- It wasn't him.
- I didn't say he...
It wasn't him.
It wasn't his brother.
It wasn't my brother.
It wasn't Bart Simpson.
It wasn't anybody.
"Now get off me bleedin' back, will ya?"
I'm sick of it!
- She didn't...
"- You keep out of it, right!"
"He is a ride, though, isn't he?"
Frank Kinsella.
Bitch.
"What's that that's on, Sharon?"
- Why not?
Because I beat him at table tennis.
It destroyed him.
You can't do that!
That was in Italy.
That's Da...
Jørgen.
Was I silly to bring them?
"No, I'd like to see them all."
What happened back then?
Why didn't you come home?
I just didn't.
We had broken up.
"And you were drunk all the time, right?"
Yeah.
And you did her friend?
"Yep, I think I actually did that."
- Would you like dessert?
"- Yes, please."
"Jacob, I am glad you came anyway."
I thought it all through yesterday   and I became convinced we must continue.
You would like to continue?
As though nothing's happened?
"Yes, it fits even better now."
"- Well, let's try then."
- Are you hungry?
We need some lunch.
We're going to lunch.
Wasn't it strange meeting her again...
Helene?
Yes.
Don't you think she's ageing well?
I'm just trying to deal with this shit. I didn 't ask forthis.
"What, and I did ?"
I climbed on top of myself and got pregnant ?
You want me to take him to my mother's ?
I'll take him.
Get his shit ready.
Get him ready !
"Oh, no."
You're not going now here with my son tonight.
"Not on that temper, and not with that attitude."
"Look, you know what ?"
Fine.
"Then, I won't take him. I'm outta here."
"Go ahead, leave."
That's what you're good at !
Your son ain't seen nothing but your back since he was born !
- [DoorCloses] - [Baby Crying]
"[Babies Crying, Murmuring]"
[Woman] Shawana Clarke.
Shawana Clarke.
Do you want me to take him ?
No.
"[Woman] Travis, come here."
"Come here, Travis."
"Travis, put that down."
Excuse me. I have been here for an hour and a half.
Am I gonna be able to see a doctor anytime soon ?
"I've already told you, we'll get you in as soon as we can."
My appointment was an hour ago.
I already got here early.
We are doing the best we can.
We have a lot of people.
"Me, too."
"Money or not, I'll stay."
I'll need a third.
"Sorry, Captain."
I have a family.
I'm not crazy.
"Captain, three men can't hold off a party of Ree, much less some boys."
"Besides, $70 ain't gonna buy nobody a new set of ears."
"A hundred, then."
This man is the only reason we're still alive.
We were 45 men when this started.
Now we're ten.
Almost nine.
HAWK:
He's my father.
He can have my share.
JIM:
"Mine, too."
He can have my share also.
All right.
"If Mr. Bridger feels the same way,"
I'll lag behind with them.
You?
Yep.
You already lost my share of the pelts so I got no choice but to make it up by some other means.
Sticking around for another day or two don't make no difference.
$300...at least I get to go home with something.
"Glass is to be cared for until, understood?"
Yeah.
You have my word.
I understand.
HENRY:
Thank you.
This is good stuff.
Real good stuff.
Why are you driving me nuts?
Know how much I cried waiting for you?
You did?
I'm sorry.
Know how hard it was for me?
I was crying on the porch because of you.
Let me ask you something.
Please be honest.
Please.
"That night, when I was outside, what were you doing in the room?"
I'm getting sick of this.
It's that again?
I don't know.
Don't know anything anymore.
"Joongrae, don't lie to me."
"Please, don't lie."
Do whatever you want.
What did I do so wrong to deserve this?
What did I do?
I'm sick of it all.
"What's wrong with you, Moonsook?"
That's not important.
Somebody walked over me.
"You two walked over me, huh?"
"When I was outside, you two walked over me."
"I thought I was dreaming, but it was real."
I don't believe this.
"Walk over me, did you?"
How dare you?
What is it?
What's wrong?
"Sorry, it's just..."
Didn't know I'd put it on.
Old habits...
It's cooler.
"Yeah, it is, isn't it?"
It is very cool.
Bow ties are cool!
"No, the room."
The room is getting colder.
She's coming back!
What's she going to do?
Is she going to punish me?
Uh... uh...
She's learnt not to melt.
"Of course, she's not really a governess, she's just a beast."
She's going to eat you.
Run.
"Children, what is exp..."
Who the devil are you?
!
What are you doing in my house?
It's OK!
"I am your governess' gentleman friend, and we've just been upstairs... kissing!"
"Captain Latimer, in the garden, there's snowmen!"
"And they're just growing, out of nowhere, all by themselves - look!"
"Good evening, I'm a lizard woman from the dawn of time and this is my wife!"
This dwelling is under attack!
"Remain calm, human scum!"
So!
Any questions?
I want action plans on my desk in one hour.
Stay vigilant.
I'm not losing any more of you.
Now I got to go call krzeminski's wife.
I'll call his girlfriend.
♪ There's a somebody I'm longing to see ♪
♪ I hope that he turns out to be ♪
♪ someone who'll watch over me
♪ I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood ♪
The usual?
"Yes, please."
♪ I know I could always be good ♪
♪ to one who'll watch over me
Anything else?
Uh... ♪ although he may not be the man ♪
I...
I thought I might
Tell you about my day if you have a moment.
"Yeah, that would be a nice change."
I got plenty of time on my hands.
All ears.
"Uh, it's just that..."
One of my co-workers died today.
"Geez, peg."
That's too bad.
Right there on the job?
"Yes, it was sudden."
I know how you feel...
blindsided.
Like when my cousin ralphie got hit by a bus.
"Granted, he did just knock off a newsstand, but still."
Big shock.
Shit.
All the cameras are down.
Audio's on a separate file.
- Yeah.
- Pull it up.
Here.
Nothing.
What time was that?
- One hour ago.
- Earlier.
Fuck you!
Do you wanna be a fucking hero?
Go back further.
We just gotta hold out a couple of hours till Emerson gets here and then I hope...
- Quiet!
- Get off of me!
- Where is she?
- Fuck you!
You go get her.
Tell her to come out.
Tell her to come out right now!
Take a fucking seat!
We know you have to open the door from the inside.
Can you get her to do that for us?
It'll be a lot easier.
Fuck you.
I need to get inside the broadcast room.
I need the girl to open the door.
I need her to take care of some numbers for me.
Now this is something only she can do.
And I'm kinda on a tight schedule.
They didn't know about the change in schedule.
"Well, I won it."
"Hey, mate."
I want a shot to get it back.
"Fuck you, Commodore."
I won this money.
All right?
"It's all right with me, pal."
-Good meeting' with ya.
"-Come on, Jim."
Wait a minute.
Let's play.
Did you see that good-looking girl that I was talking to leave here?
"No, I don't know where she went."
"Okay, you can turn 'em on."
I told you we shouldn'a hooked this up in the rain in the first place.
"Finish up, already."
-You check the connections?
"-Yes, I checked the connections."
-Did you check the switch?
-I checked the switch.
"Well, go check the hookup."
"Your boss say, ""Sign work both day and night."" I wanna lights on."
"-Want a cup of coffee, Nick?"
-Turn 'em on.
He's checkin' the hookup.
"Well, hurry up."
I wanna see lights on.
Turn on.
"Where the hell is it, anyhow?"
"Go around there, he said it's around to the left."
"Yeah, I think I've found it."
He would have found us anyway.
"Look, you Boss told you to give me something in this replacement."
Then give me and go.
"No, How could I give you that?"
"It's not your age, Age not concerns."
"You know, how many little people has gone there."
"Look, I can't raise you up."
"I am saying, Sorry."
"I am saying, Sorry."
"You were the only Laxmi, Who was my last hope,"
"And If you betrays me, then what will happen with me?"
Think about it.
"Kill me, Kill me, Please, I want to go up."
"Kill me, Laxmi!"
"Leave me,"
"Kill me, please!"
Kill me.
Let me go.
What you've done?
We stop him to go.
"Don't touch him, He is my Laxminarayan."
"No, he's our Laxminarayan."
Who told you?
"He's our piece, He's not a piece, he's Laxminarayan."
"He's ours, He's mine."
"He's ours, He's mine."
One minute.
"Yes, Madam, Where are you?"
You know Laxminarayan was coming on 11:00.
"Yes, Madam but how could he?"
He's lay down here.
"He is not, He stands next to me."
You people come soon here.
But don't think that's an end to this.
You and your bitch will regret this.
Mark my words.
- Right.
- OK.
I need a drink.
Aargh!
Hm.
Your name is reynolds and before that it was knealy.
"And you ain't never been no jones,"
- So get over it.
"- You'll never get it, will you, mama?"
You just don't understand.
"If it makes me act the way you've been acting all your life,"
- I hope i never get it!
"- Whatever, mama!"
And you know how you're always giving me those bible scriptures
And those quotes from famous people?
"Well, here's a bible scripture for you..."
"""The wealth of the wicked is laid upon the righteous."""
"Well, i am the righteousness of god."
"- Why didn't you give me that scripture, mama?"
- Oh.
Oh.
"God, forgive her."
"Oh, give me the strength."
"Hold me back, jesus."
Hold me back.
"Hey, it's me..."
Marcus.
Marcus!
Come in.
- Come on.
"- Oh, my goodness."
Are you getting tired?
You want me to wheel you?
- No!
- All right.
- Absolutely no.
- All right.
This is a big place.
Do you know where you're going?
When we come in the first building - You come into the building -
One second.
Could it be over there?
"- Yes, it must be."
- You think it might be there?
- Yeah.
- 'Cause there's more than one entrance.
- But we're gonna look at them all.
"- Well, there's a fence there."
Let's have a look.
Do you see it here?
"- No, not here?"
"- It's downstairs, where you come in."
All right.
Let's go to the other entrance.
I think I know which one you're talking about.
This way.
- I'm thinking it might be along here.
- It's in the entrance.
"Well, let's - let's have a look here."
And he never even told me it was there.
- He didn't tell you?
"Oh, come on."
Who'd check out some gorgeous hottie walking down the street?
- Thanks.
- I was talking about me.
Alex... there's no reason to get paranoid.
But just to be on the safe side...
- What?
- Just go with me on this.
Who was that?
No idea.
I'm really starting to like this hiding thing.
- Don't answer it.
- Not planning on it.
I have to answer it.
It's my assistant.
"Hey, Molly."
"Okay, calm down."
I'm on my way.
I have to go sign some contracts that were dropped off at my apartment by mistake.
Can we pick this up a little later?
It's not like I'm a faucet.
You can't just turn me on and off.
Step.
Step.
We're just going in there to pick up some documents.
Fine.
- And make out a little.
- Works for me.
Surprise!
"Scott, this is everybody."
"Everybody, you all know Scott-- the enemy."
Molly... you did all this for me?
I had a dog like him once.
I went to have him put down.
He jumped out of my arms at the vet's and took off for the park.
Sometimes I still think I see him out there...
... watchingme...
... gnawingonan oldbone.
Excuse me.
"Hello, Nettie."
Can I help you with the basket?
"No, no. I didn't know Frank was expecting you."
Due espressi?
.
Maybe later.
"99 out of 1 00 times, we can beat something like this."
I don't like the odds.
We go back a long way.
"I know, I know."
"I tried to close the door, Frank."
Couldn't get it shut.
-What do you want me to do?
-Take the pressure off yourself.
Here's the thing.
They'll tell you:
"""""Yeah, yeah, sure."
You have the key to the cell.
"Go ahead. """""
But you won't be able to open it without singing.
You're a singer.
"Give me a chance, and I'll show you how quiet I can be."
"It's out of my hands, Frank."
"Do the right thing, will you?"
-Make it easy for yourself.
Have a nice life.
Françoise.
Thank you.
Thomas.
You hate me.
Is that it?
You must stop calling me.
File a complaint with my insurance.
I will still call you.
Yeah.
I'll never file a complaint.
It's not my style.
I wouldn't have complained to your boss either.
You don't say.
It's obvious you love your work.
What?
I love my work?
As if fucking the disabled was a vocation.
No one forces you to do this.
- Yes.
They do.
How can you be forced into it?
I did some things.
What things?
Illegal things.
I can't talk about it.
I was given a substitution sentence.
Wait a second.
You were sentenced to being a prostitute for the disabled?
You don't have to insult me.
- No.
I'm a hostess.
- There's no problem?
- No.
Where's my camera?
"Ali, where is it?"
I haven't seen it.
Look in the glove-box.
- Wait for me.
"- Farzad, put the bread there."
"Hello, engineer."
Hello.
"Farzad, wrap up the bread or it will dry out."
Would you like tea?
"Yes, thank you."
My colleagues are sleeping.
We'll have a walk and come back.
Off you go.
Which way's your school?
This way and that.
You have two schools then?
"No, there are two paths to school."
Where's the square?
This way.
You don't mind.
"Come this way, I'll get my camera."
What a handsome white village!
"Why is it called ""Black Valley""?"
The ancestors called it that.
"Can't you call it ""White Valley""?"
"No, we have to call it by its name."
It has to stay that way.
That's how it is.
"""When you're fahed ho be black..."
"""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!"""
Now just pump the brakes right there.
- I got a question.
- Have at 'er.
Then I got a comment.
"Well, let's hear it, good buddy."
"Now, my question."
"When have you ever heard a girl go,"
"""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."""
- Well...
- Other than in a porno.
- I don't believe I have.
- Me neithers.
That's because we don't say that.
- Well...
- Not unless it's in a porno.
WAYNE:
Now my comment.
"You see, the way Dary did the ""yes, yes, yes, yes, yes's"""
"is not the way they do the ""yes, yes, yes"" in pornos."
That's the way they do it.
"The girl gets all excited, and she goes,"
"""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."""
"Yes, but the way you're doing the ""yes, yes, yes, yes's"""
"is not the way they do the ""yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."""
DARYL:
It is the way they do it.
"They go, ""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."""
- That's exactly how they do it.
- WAYNE:
"No, they don't."
What they do is they find a super-high pitch for those first four yes's.
- Really?
- Sure did.
"So, what made you just call me out of the blue like that?"
"Oh, well, Gary told me you said hi."
- I didn't say hi.
- You didn't?
"No, I told him to send you my regards."
I didn't say hi.
- Regards?
"- Yeah, regards."
"Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug."
"Oh, I hate smugness."
Don't you hate smugness?
Smugness is not a good quality.
"Oh, my God, that man over there."
I think he's wearing glasses that look like Jake's.
Pull over.
Stop the car.
Here.
I think I've got a way of getting back at my ex- boyfriend.
Good.
Revenge is very good.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
Excuse me.
"Sir, sir?"
- Yeah.
"If you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where you got your glasses?"
- Malaysia.
- Malaysia?
Yeah.
"Look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?"
There's been a breach in the sim room.
JEANINE:
Get me a remote feed.
I wanna see who the hell is in there.
"The cameras are down in the sector, too."
I'm sending guards there now.
Let's go.
Bring up every cell.
Now.
Show her.
Tori finally found a way to get 'em out safely.
EVELYN:
How many others?
Every last one.
Let's go.
SOLDIER:
"South corridor, 40 yards down."
Tris?
"Tris, come on, we gotta move."
"Tris, we have to move."
I can't.
I can't.
My mom died protecting whatever's inside of this.
I have to open it for her and I think I know how.
"Tris, if we don't leave now, we're not gonna get outta here."
I have to do this first.
"Look, I know it doesn't make any sense, but you have to trust me, please."
"With my life, apparently."
MAN ON PA:
"All security teams, be advised, breach in..."
Do it.
MAX:
No trouble.
- It's all good.
- All right.
Are you sure?
- Is there something I should know?
"- No, no."
Everything's good.
It's just a status check.
"Don't dawdle, stay in touch."
Kirk out.
He's fine.
So is Myka.
Okay?
Put it down on red 15.
- I got nothing.
- Nothing's going on down here either.
They're still winning and I'll be damned if I know how.
I know.
I am.
I just think that's...
- What if you put those two together...
- I don't think that's gonna work.
- What about what we tried in...
- What is that?
It's just something I whipped up.
- What do you mean?
Just now?
- That's right.
"Wait, wait."
- What are you doing?
- I'm opening a line of communications.
CIA uses laser mics to read vibrations off windows to hear what's going on on the other side of the window.
Father?
I don't understand.
you're...
You're his son?
"If my son were alive, he'd be 34 years old."
xxx
There's another one of those things out there.
Look what it did to Zaddik.
I say we go after it now!
No one's going anywhere.
We'll handle this.
Stay calm.
How is he?
"I've given him something for the pain, but his injuries are too severe."
He's not going to make it.
This can't be happening.
It's not possible.
I'm sorry.
Don't blame Ellia.
It was my idea.
"You... have to understand... that when I found her,"
I'd just lost my own wife and son to a fever.
"She was just lying there, helpless."
"When I saw her, I knew what I had to do."
"As I told you, in the beginning, she survived on food and water like any young girl."
xxx
No.
No!
It's all right.
Take what you need.
I can't.
"Yes, you can."
"I'm not prying or anything, but as the manager, I should..."
What's with the rubber bands?
"An inmate in a Tokyo prison put 11 rubber bands around his neck and managed to commit suicide,"
so I wondered if that's possible.
Turns out it kinda works.
"Oh yeah, you could die."
You okay?
Yeah.
This is intense.
"We're done filming, thank you."
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
"Kim, they're done on floor 2, so grab some guys and clean up."
Miyu.
What?
"Porn wasn't... your first time, was it?"
First what?
First time having sex.
"No, of course not."
Someone you liked?
Yeah.
Glad to hear that.
But he died in the tsunami.
"We're leaving, Azusa."
Okay.
See you.
Maybe I'll come again.
"No, don't come."
"We're staying overnight, right?"
"Yeah, choose any room."
"Any room, really?"
The cheapest is fine.
"I'm his wife, I have to be here!"
-We'll take care of Migs.
-His blood pressure?
"Just stay here, we'll take care of this."
We still can't be sure of the extent of the damage but he's still lucky he didn't get a fracture in the skull.
"-Doc, when is he waking up?"
-There's a lot of possible outcomes.
But I promise...
"Whatever happens to him, I'll still take care of him."
Is there anyone looking for me?
.
No one.
But I already found the man I love in the whole world.
How's Migs?
He hasn't waken up yet.
I'm sure he will wake up.
Aren't you going to visit again?
.
"You know, I'm not supposed to be there."
My son!
My son!
Brother!
Come here.
Come.
How are you feeling?
"Come, one more."
There's Joy.
Who are you?
.
I'm your wife.
I'm Joy.
I don't know her.
- I'll call you back in an hour.
Bye.
They belong together.
They've danced for the Pope.
What kind of music is that?
They brought it with them.
Who would want to listen to that?
The Pope?
How would I know?
"Man Viktor, I wanted a singer."
Ask them if they can sing.
Excuse me.
Do you have a song prepared?
"Singing, songs!"
What's this pop shit?
What's this one's name here?
-That's Angie.
"Angie, Bring me a soda."
That's going to take a little while...
"First, I have to finish up the glasses, boss."
We could forget about the girls and just do your uncle's quiz show.
Why can't she just bring me a soda when I order a soda.
She likes to do one thing after another.
"Listen Viktor, let me tell you something."
Even if the quiz show works out...
Which we have no idea about yet...
It will work out.
I want a number here with a singer.
High class!
Alright.
High... class!
I'll take care of it!
- No.
- Huh?
Are you goin' sick?
- No!
"What do you say we ""popeye"" down to the Chez and have a couple of drinks?"
- I'm beat.
I'm gonna go home.
- All right.
One drink.
- Drink this.
- Whip it out. [Laughs]

Can we have your car?
Of course.
What -- what happens now?
"Once we bust out of here, that CIA team is gonna be all over you, so just...tell them that we stole your car."
"And just tell them that... that you don't know me anymore, okay?"
Can you -- can you tell them that?
"I'm sorry, Elsa, but it's just not safe."

Something I found in Chuck's room.
Well then I bet it's good.
Are you dressing for someone?
Yes.
Someone I hope is finally ready to love me
The way Cyrus loves you.
Cyrus told me.
You told Chuck how you felt and...
He ran away.
You seeing him tonight?
Yes.
Don't let him get away again
Oh..
Hey..drunky.
Don't embarrass yourself.
Dan.
You're here.
There's something I have to tell you
And it's only because I'm drunk
And I'll probably never see you again.
I um....
Oh God.
I have to go.
Turn over the money I only took in this much all day!
How can I?
So what!
?
"Come on, come on"
Turn over the money
Bring it here!
"I've paid the fee everyday, Master"
But business was bad today
Please be patient!
Don't think you can put it off!
Stop!
You bastards
You drink the people's blood!
Let's see how fast you can kill me!
Beat him!
You bully as too much!
"Well, go teach them a lesson!"
Okay!
Use this
Okay
What are you doing?
Let us borrow this for a minute!
Stop!
What are you doing?
Go after you've paid the fees!
Fees?
What fees?
I don't have any money!
"I have a life, though!"
That's enough!
I'll see how hard your bones are!
What are you looking for?
- Death?
- That's funny.
That's all the Death Zone offers your people.
I'm looking for a man.
He is not a man!
His blood is as black as coal!
You know it.
I saw how he buried you alive.
For him you are dead now.
It will not give you more trouble.
I stole something.
Something very special.
What?
My daughter.
Is the child yours?
- Little?
- Yeah.
But I thought she was one of them.
Can you take me with her?
"Dangerous, she is protected."
"Please, Atka."
My life is nothing without it.
"Quannik thought, that the time of red blood soon ends."
Soon comes the time of black blood.
He lives for 143 years.
Many of his visions came true.
He said there will be no cure for black blood.
Ash is nearby.
I can feel his presence.
Its smell is lifeless.
Your path does not make sense.
Did I have spare clothes?
I'm back.
Rin will play lacrosse!
But she's not a student.
It's impossible.
She applied for permission.
Can we order now?
please.
Rin will be fine!
She'II play lacrosse.
hello!
It's not working because you're bending your elbow.
"Rin, show us."
Let your force flow forward.
Teacher.
Manager.
Minmin.
Raw power won't do it.
"blend the power of the ball into your power, Iet them flow!"
Wow!
Saw that?
Why are you here?
It's quite an interesting sport.
"Hey, Minmin."
relax!
"With me, you don't have to practice martial arts."
Now I want to play!
Who's he?
Does it matter?
How's my lipstick?
Perfect!
Let him apply for the coach post.
"Look, I said I was out."
"I know, I know."
I respect your decision.
This is for Morgan.
He was your patient.
He talk about medieval torture?
In disturbing detail.
Big weirdo.
"Well, see ya."
"Annie, wait."
You just said you respected my decision.
It's not about that.
I have a favor to ask you.
A favor for you is like the kiss of death.
"I need you to go to this address and babysit on this guy for the day, make sure he stays sober."
- Not interested.
- I'll pay you.
"Look, I know I'm an asshole."
And I've been reckless... but everything I've done was to try to protect us.
"And I can fix this, but I need your help."
Who is he?
He's a friend.
$50 an hour.
"You really will be a millionaire one day, Annie."
I know.
"Hey,"
I bet this is one of them self-melting driveways.
Yeah.
I bet you should've been a football player.
Yeah.
Mrs. Dixon?
What's going on?
Get away from the clown car...
- Nate:
"It's gonna be okay, sweetheart."
- You asshole!
She shouldn't have to bear witness to your hate!
You like that?
!
It's the hose of justice!
- The hose of just... oh.
- [Stops spraying]
"Well, obviously, I'm not gonna spray you."
How can you defend him?
"He's a pediatrician, for god sakes."
We trusted him with our children.
"Yeah, so did I, and he's got a very gentle hand."
Don't use us as propaganda!
What are you guys doing over there?
Get in here.
- We're on the right side!
"- No, you're not!"
"Fine, you're gonna have to spray..."
"Dad, I can't believe you sprayed... aah!"
Protestors:
Ohh!
Aah!
Get in here and get changed for the wedding.
What the hell?
!
Seriously!
Aah!
We've got you on camera.
You're gonna regret this.
"Well, I could ask you the same question."
"Yeah, well, I'm here with the make-a-wish clowns."
We're visiting the children's ward.
Who are you with?
I'm freelancing.
"Can I speak to you outside for a moment, please?"
Sure.
"All right, man, can we stop this?"
We have hit rock bottom.
I'll admit it.
I have felt better about myself.
"Now, let's just put this competition aside."
"Come on, we're friends."
We can't do this to each other.
Aah!

- Dr. Lonsdale.
"- Hey, Sara, what's up?"
"Oh, not much."
Just prepping for my laparoscopic fetal kidney surgery.
"Hey, have you spoken to Riley recently?"
I have.
"This morning, actually."
She broke up with me.
What?
"Oh, God, that's awful!"
- I'm so sorry.
"- No, it's okay."
"I mean, the timing was obviously bad, with her moving to Egypt for two years."
"Me and him, we had a... talk."
A talk?
Sometimes that's all it takes.
Chivonne?
You won't have no more problems with him.
I promise.
Thanks.
I liked walking you home the other day.
I was thinking maybe we can make it a habit.
Don't.
Don't what?
I know what you want.
For you and me.
But I can't do it.
What you did doesn't change things between us.
It doesn't make us family.
I came to you because I had to.
Do you understand?
I understand.
You do what you need to do.

What is this really about?
"Well, we're just trying to clarify the circumstances of your husband's death."
Troy had cancer.
He died.
Seems pretty clear to me.
Your client is a primary suspect in a murder investigation.
"Define ""cooperate."""
- No!
- Do you like them?
The Paki had me while I sucked off the black guy.
"By the way, his name is Lamin and he's really nice."
What shall I say at school?
My sister does porn.
- Why?
- Because I can't be a model.
- And I'm sick of school.
- Maybe I can buy up the negatives.
You think everything revolves around you.
"- Sofie, stay here!"
- There are more mags at the kiosk.
Sofie!
One more year.
Then you can do want you want.
Sofie!
"Mum, it's Sofie."
Listen.
Did you hear that?
It was your car.
You'll have to catch the bus to work.
- You fucking whore!
- I'm not a whore.
Fucking three darkies in a porn mag without telling me first!
Smashing up her car would have done the trick.
- You didn't have to do those photos.
- I did it for us.
So we could go to New York.
- Us?
We're through.
"- Don't go, Simon."
"Look, it's a little after 6:00."
I'll catch a ride and see you out there.
Bye.
- John.
- Yeah?
"The Balkans peace council is ""comprised"""
"or ""composed"" of ten members?"
Twelve members.
"Oh, right."
Thanks.
Composed.
What?
A three-block area has been evacuated.
You might wanna avoid that route coming home from work.
"- What do you think, Cy?"
- I'll lead with it.
- Great.
I'll see you Monday.
This'll make them sweat.
It's good.
What?
- I gotta go.
"- Come on, John."
"It'll look bad, my star reporter not showing up at the Christmas party."
I can't.Mary's waiting for me.
"It's a big house, isn't it?"
It's a steal at this price.
That's if you want it.
But we're gonna have to make an offer today.
The owner's highly motivated.
Think it over.
I'll make some calls.Take a look around.
Um... do you live here?
My dad has me on the weekends.
He's been online dating and he brings his dates here.
"But, on the bright side, I get to hang out with ol' Beanbag here."
"Up top, Beanbag."
Boom!
Yep.
We see a lot of Rudy.
Okay... rules:
"One, you can't leave the Juice Caboose for the duration of the trip."
"Two, don't bother me."
"And three, uh..."
always believe in yourself.
Thanks.
We can't leave the Juice Caboose?
Are you kidding me?
!
"Get comfy, 'cause this room is your life for the next four hours."
But there's nothing to do!
Open this door!
I can't hear you!
"The train's too loud... honk, honk."
"Honk, honk?"
!
Trains don't make that noise!
"All right, this is gonna be great."
We have a babysitter and a lot of alcohol.
"Wait, don't do..."
"No, don't do it!"
It's a tasting.
"You're supposed to swirl it around and shake the glass to open it up, or something."
"Hey, open up, wine!"
"Whatever it is, it's really knocked him for six."
I think I know what it was.
- Really?
Pilchards.
What?
- They must have been on the turn.
"Well, don't look so worried."
Anyone can make a mistake.
Why won't you take my money?
"If you hadn't allowed us to pick your fruit, we'd never have made all this."
I'm not going until you let me pay for it.
Not for the WI and not for you.
For the fleet.
It would be lovely to see you at our meeting this evening.
"Busy, I'm afraid."
All the more reason.
Everyone gets so much from it.
"Without it, I sometimes think I'd curl up in bed and never get up."
Hello.
"Thank you, driver."
"- That's all right, miss."
Excuse me...
"Oh, Mr Wilson."
Er...
Spencer.
Hi.
Would you like to try some of our jam?
Why not?
I helped make it.
Try that.
Mmm.
Delicious!
is there somebody else I can talk to ?
"[Continues, indistinct]"
Wench. I gotta stand over her... to make sure she puts your name on the damn list.
Triflin' bitch.
Okay.
Ooo-kay.
Yeah.
Da da da da da da da da.
- l'll get that.
- [ Baby Gurgling ]
Da da !
I know. I know.
I know. I know.
"So, your dad's trippin' about the flight."
-Yeah.
-Probably thinks it's Derek's fault.
"No, I explained about Nikki."
"So, you put it all on her."
None of it's on you.
She started it.
I told you what she said.
"Maybe she didn't have no business getting up in your face, but she had reason to say what she said."
Wait a minute.
You agree with her ?
You and Derek act like it don't bother people to see you together.
Like it don't hurt people to see.
"Well, we like each other."
What is the big damn deal ?
"It's me and him, not us and other people."
"Black people, Sara."
Black women.
Derek's about something.
Did you know everybody at this school?
"Got to watch where you're going, man."
"Leave him alone, Dirk."
"You never learn, do you, midget?"
"Get to the bus, Barry."
What's the matter?
You scared?
Don't worry.
I'll go easy on you this time.
"Come on, Lose-Chester."
Let's see what you got.
"Come on, freak!"
Freak!
You're not tough.
You're just a jerk.
"""Dirk the jerk."""
"""Dirk the jerk."" Yeah, that's pretty good."
Dirk the jerk.
"So, you were friends with Dirk?"
"Yes, sir, in high school."
I don't recall Dirk having many friends at Truman.
"Here, sit."
Sit down.
"When did, uh -- when did Dirk pass?"
He was 18.
What happened to him?
"Well, there was, first, drinking, then drugs, and then too many drugs."
And then he just slipped through my fingers.
It was my fault.
"I should have seen it coming, you know?"
"Dirk, he, uh -- well, he had his troubles."
What kind of troubles?
"Your serum doesn't work, father."
It never has.
That's impossible.
It's been two years since you... since the last time.
That wasn't your fault.
It was my idea.
I needed time to perfect the forumla.
But it wasn't working.
The hunger just got worse.
What did you do?
I'm sorry father.
No.
"No, that was the other one."
It was both of us.
I sensed him out there.
I knew when he was feeding and I would go out at the same time.
"No, it can't be."
Ellia!
Stay away!
What is it?
What's happening?
Let me help you.
Sheppard.
This is where he's been making camp.
He was here less than an hour ago.
You hear anything?
No.
Me either.
Easy now.
"You just went to all that trouble to save my life, it would be a shame to kill me."
"Are you alright, Rodney?"
"Yeah, I'm just peachy now."
"Okay, guys, come on."
"Let's go, seriously."
We can do that later.
- You okay?
-Yeah.
(PANTING)
"Thank you, Peter."
"Yeah, whatever."
"Now we're even, stiff."
All right.
"Come on, let's go."
Before Jeanine realizes you're still alive.
"- No, no, no."
-What?
The box.
We have to get the box.
"What, are you kidding me?"
"Now's not the time for a souvenir, Tris."
"Four, you have to listen to me."
It's not what Jeanine thinks it is.
I know it's not.
My mother would have destroyed it.
We have to get it.
"Peter, is there another way into the lab?"
"I mean, I'd have to go into the control room to disable all the doors."
"Okay, good, then do that."
Okay.
Right now?
Yeah.
"You just chose our side, whether you meant to or not."
"If you wanna survive, make sure we do."
Let's go.
And I'll get you away from here.
"No, no, francis."
There's something else that you must do.
"Everything I did, I did for you."
You needn't remind me.
I need you to forget all of it.
What?
Everything I warned you of.
The warnings I gave mary.
"Go to her, tell her that I believe"
The two of you can be wed.
I don't understand.
Your fate has changed.
"Oh, what does it matter?"
You never believed
That nostradamus had the power
To see the future anyway.
What matters is that you love mary.
I did love mary.
You destroyed that.
Nonsense.
"She's with bash now, but she loves you."
You don't know that.
I don't know that.
What matters is what you want.
Is it mary?
Is it to save my life?
Is it the throne of France?
Is it the safety of your brothers?
"Say it, say it!"
I know it's true!
Yes.
Yeah!
"Yeah, yeah, kid, she's hot as a torch, but you don't know anything about her."
- I know plenty.
- Yeah?
Where's she from?
Somewhere else.
Why'd she leave?
Who cares?
"Her past doesn't matter, long as her future's with me."
"Oh, Petey, ever since this girl came to town, you got a dream in your head where your sense ought to be."
"- You know what, Dad?"
- What?
You're right.
Petey...
"I love you, Nicky Johnson."
Marry me.
Marcy came to see me.
She's fine.
Thought you'd like to know that.
Why didn't you bring her home?
She's 18.
"She's still my little girl, Agent Kelton."
"I'm sorry about that, but there was nothing I could do."
What we need to talk about is Curtis McNeal.
"Yeah, I just heard."
It's terrible.
"So what aren't you telling me, Senator?"
Excuse me?
"Look, I've worked a lot of kidnaps, but this one's different."
"They're trying to get to you, and they're trying to get to me."
Why?
I have no idea.
"Sis, if you only told me we're going here, I should've worn rubber shoes and pants!"
To think I gave too much effort.
Sis?
"Sis, are you okay?"
.
Do you know that Migs proposed to me in front of that tree?
"He told me, however strong that tree is, that's how strong his love for me is."
That's why I want to see that tree.
"As long as that tree is right there,"
I won't lose hope.
"Everything will be alright, Sis."
How many copies to you want me to buy?
.
-What?
How many letters?
.
-What's that?
Five!
Five!
Five!
He's pestering me!
"Yes, okay!"
"I'll call you later, wait!"
Hey!
You're such a pest!
Give me that!
Hey!
Give that to me!
I'm going with them.
I love you.
But I want to experience life in Canada.
You know that long distance relationships are hard.
Hello.
-Hi.
Dude!
Thomas!
How's he doing?
Not so bad.
"There cerebral hematoma, but should to withdraw."
-Will there be consequences?
I had no idea.
I'm not a doctor.
They closed squat.
I know.
"If you want, come in Montrouge."
There are places.
Thank you.
"Here we are, do not worry."
We will avenge you.
Is Pierre here?
"I know 's early, but I see it."
Pierre does not work here.
Yeah?
I'll give you his new address.
I guess he not sit with what detention.
We all have our limits.
"But he seemed love, poor guy."
"Do not bother, you might You may be of help."
I was wondering who posted photos of my investigative files on the Internet.
He is not.
It can not be he said.
But you could be you.
Why would I do?
Because you hate cops.
Nothing!
Be careful who you get your information from.
- That guy is out for blood.
- Let me go.
It was an accident.
And it wasn't me.
It was my partner.
I didn't even draw my weapon.
"If you killed someone, I'd cover for you too."
Is that wrong?
Let's go to Marina's house.
"No, how could he be the father?"
He's 87 years old!
"Tell them I'll do anything, I don't care."
- Hello?
- It's me.
"Hi, Marina."
I wanted to know what's happening with Malaga.
When will they call me?
"Look, there was a problem with your contract."
They're not hiring anyone until next year.
Talk to them.
"Tell them I'll do anything, I don't care."
I have to get out of here.
I can't take it anymore.
Let's meet.
At the usual spot in half an hour.
She called this number.
It's the hunting lodge.
It's okay.
Coming!
Who is it?
!
I just told her it's a surprise for your birthday.
She was thrilled.
Where'd you get the money?
It's all on me.
- But...
"- None of your business, Dorona."
I have the money and I want to do it.
But what'll I eat there?
You're looking at a nut and that's all you care about?
I want to try and find him.
Why?
- What?
- Nothing.
- Where to?
- Paris.
He wanted to come.
And you agreed?
What did he tell you?
"Nothing, I swear."
You have separate rooms.
- And he speaks fluent French.
- So do we.
"- Yeah, like morons."
- Is he going to be with us the whole time?
I'm going home.
Shai got you business class?
Why only you?
"Don't drink too much, your legs will swell."
- When will you tell me what you did?
- When will you tell me what you did?
- Are you starting again?
"Carter, there's no way I can get my hands"
On that much cash in an hour.
Not as a private citizen.
There's nobody in the government you can ask?
No one who'd even entertain it.
"And in any case, the request would go into the system and alert the leak."
"Okay, okay."
I have an idea.
I'll get back to you.
Carter?
Hey.
So you can change.
Or I could get you something else if you want.
"- No, thanks."
- All right.
"Isaac, um... is everything all right?"
You seem...
I don't know.
It's been a rough year.
Other people wanting what's mine.
"You can always get out, you know."
Yeah.
"Look, I got a deal about to go down with some Dominicans."
Right?
They're gonna move my product on the north side.
That'll put me back on top.
I'll be a'ight.
Yeah.
What?
How's Nicole?
"She's fine, like I said she'd be."
"What, you called to talk to her?"
# I need you to know that I love you
# I want to be the man you hoped I'd be
# To find my place amongst the crowd
# To see your face
# And know
# You're proud of me. #
Hewitt?
Was Baker not on your tram?
"No, sir."
That'll do it.
Here they come.
"Purcell, boys."
Too early for Humperdinck.
"Sorry, I'm not sure where I should stand for the microphone."
Probably best if I conduct.
"Get a chair for Miss Riall out of the way, Lionel."
Right you are.
Should I just warm them up?
"Oh, I don't think we need bother with that."
"Round about this tempo, boys."
Once through for luck.
"I didn't get the chance to ask, are we all here?"
Apart from Baker.
Baker?
But he was so excited about it.
Did he send a message?
No.
Just didn't turn up.
So he's out.
"Well, I'm very disappointed."
I had great hopes of Baker.
Aren't you disappointed?
Claire's...
Claire's dead.
"Now, will you take that soup and get out of here."
I can't take anymore today.
"Look, all I meant was you..."
Will you just get out of here!
Sir...
And stay out!
"Sir, he didn't mean any harm, if you'll forgive me for saying so, sir."
"I sometimes have a silly effect on people, you know what I mean?"
"Just being a police lieutenant, you know."
"At least, I hope that's why."
"Yes, I'm sure it is."
"Your friend, sir."
He was just trying to be nice.
(SIGHS)
What?
Oh.
Him.
"No, no."
He wasrt trying to be nice.
He was trying to fix me up with an alibi.
Then it wasrt true?
"What, Lieutenant?"
I...
Excuse me.
I keep swimming in and out of myself.
"Well, you know, that's what happens, sir."
It's kind of like being in shock.
"Maybe you ought to sit down for a minute, sir."
I am not in shock.
I don't need to sit down.
Yes. thank you.
I'm sorry about what i said.
You don't have to apologize.
Where's chuck?
It's over... once and for all.
But i'm gonna be strong.
"Still, it doesn't feel right without him here."
You know everyone else is here.
Yeah...
Everyone's here.
Oh it's beaufiful
It looks so good on you.
Oh!
i've dreamed about this for so long.
Do you want to fire it up?
I can't. blair and I have a meeting at rouge tomate.
Huh. that's cryptic.
Both.
So how are you today?
Miserable.
But at least college
Will be the fresh start it's supposed to be.
No chuck No nate.
No anybody really.
Except gossip girl.
Forget I said that.
It's okay.
I read them too.
"""Spotted--chuck bass in france. chuck bass in germany."
"Chuck bass in italy."""
I hope he has so much fun that they have to quarantine him.
Open your present.
Teaching me.
Here it is madam 42 it'll be perfectly fit.
"Dad, listen to me."
Brother.
"Not 42, give size 40."
42 will be perfectly fine.
"Brother I said not 42, give size 40."
What are you saying?
How do you know?
It's my size.
Do you know better or me?
I can tell the size of bra by looking at the blouse.
You know my nature.
Her husband even ask me for her size.
150 please.
Here.
Give me a bag.
What's the bag for?
You're going to wear it anyway.
"Dad, You'll have to leave for Pondi."
There you'll have to meet our designer who's worked on our valentines collection.
Actually I've seen the designs on the internet.
You just need to go and make an agreement with her.
Okay I'll go.
Don't you worry.
And if you like the design give her 100000.
She need it.
Okay.
What her name?
"Shut up, Not yours."
Leave the bra.
Speak.
They attract.
Simply great!
I deeply regret to have called you.
I won't make this mistake again!
A lady has come to see you.
"All right, come"
Didn't I say I'd drop in someday?
And here I am.
You did say.
But I never expected you.
I don't know how to welcome you.
Anybody there?
"Yes, sir?"
What would you have?
Hot or cold?
Any cold drink.
"- Two cold drinks.- l will bring now, sir."
How is your father?
is that Mr Vijay's photograph?
- Yes.
He is my only friend.
Which is why I have kept his photograph.
But the walls in this room are still empty.
Why don't you fill it up with some good photographs?
Shall I ?
"Yes, Mr Daaga?"
What's up?
Don't you wory.
What am I here for?
So what ifyour men are guilty of murder?
I am there to save them.
See this bungalow!
- lt's okay.
"But look, I landed it right?"
That's all that matters.
I don't think so.
- l don't think that's all that matters.
- Say what you mean.
I'm proud of you.
I'm glad you landed the account...
- and you're fired.
- What?
You're fired because I love you... because I don't want to lose you.
"No, no, Patty, it's okay, I can fix my responsibilities."
"I know, but you're not happy, you're not."
You're...
Something has to change.
- What will we do?
I mean...
- l don't know.
- What will I do?
I don't even...
- l don't know what you're going to do.
I guess you're finally going to figure it out.
"- You know that girl, Angela Chase?"
- That redheaded girl?
Yes.
Some redhead.
It's out of a bottle.
- Anyway. is she avoiding us?
- l think she is.
I think we make her physically ill or something.
I thinks so because...
Angela.
Was that Damon Salvatore you were with?
The one and only.
Do you know him?
We go way back.
He still live out by Miller Lane?
He lives in the old boarding house.
By Wickery Bridge.
He's still in there if you wanna say hi.
I'd rather stay here and talk to you.
Oh.
Nice.
Very smooth with the shoe and the flirt.
But I'm a little drunk.
And hot guy plus drunk me equals very bad things.
I'm pretty sure you'd like it.
I'm sorry.
That was a seriously lame pick-up.
I'm sorry.
That's a nice scent you're wearing.
What is it?
I don't know.
"Ha, ha."
It was a gift.
"And that is a cab, so..."
Vervain.
Making it hard to find something to eat in this town.
- Caroline.
- I don't wanna talk about it.
You're being ridiculous.
"And insecure and stupid, but that doesn't change the fact that Matt's in love with you and I'm the backup."
- You're not the backup.
"- Yes, I am."
- WOMAN:
Get rid of her!
-Damn right.
Except you'll have to go through me first.
"Me, too."
ALL:
And all of us.
(ALL CLAMORING)
Hey!
I ain't the one with the time bomb in my arm.
MAN:
Yeah!
(ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
(TRIS SNIFFLING)
I know what you're thinking.
But I'm not gonna let you do it.
I can't let anyone else die because of me.
No one else is gonna die because of you.
Tori's gonna find a way to disable the disks...
And if she doesn't?
Then...
Then...
"Then if she doesn't, we figure it out."
Together.
You know I'm just one person.
I'm not worth it.
"No, you are worth it."
You are worth it to me.
I love you.
JEANINE: ...plays a critical role in maintaining the social order.
But this harmony we've achieved is now under attack.
This city may be safely enclosed behind a vast wall.
"You heard what I said, keep playing."
"I told you I never wanted to see you in these parts again, Black Bart."
I'll have to blow you away.
[fires cap gun]
"I got you, fall down."
"Okay, you want to play?"
I'll play with you.
Come on out.
"Let's see if your gun's as loud as your mouth,"
Sheriff.
I'll pick where to make my stand.
[fires and giggles]
Hold it.
"Smile, cowboy."
"I got it, Harry."
[laughs]
"[Billy] Bang, bang, bang!"
Whoo-hoo.
"mom, you should of seen it."
This outlaw chased me all over and then he tried to shoot me.
But he shot the head right off this fake Indian.
- Were you scared?
- No.
"Hey, I told you you'd like it."
"Thanks for bringing me, Mom, it's excellent."
"Well, here you go, you guys."
"Uh, I'm gonna go upstairs for a while, I think."
"You have a good time, okay?"
"Uh, say, uh,"
I think we ought to talk.
"See, uh..."
I know this is real hard on you.
"No, we're not!"
This is totally legit.
"For all this guy knows, we could be mega-minted poshos in disguise."
It would be a superb disguise.
Cheers.
"Take us to the bed section, my good man."
I want to try one of them.
Mm-hm.
Security!
Agh.
This chair is like a torture device.
I've asked Flavia for one with back support so many times.
At least you get a chair.
I have to stand still all day.
Think you could stand a bit stiller?
Hard to score if you're jiggling.
I don't want you to score!
Come on!
Getting balls in your jug is the only fun part of my day.
Stop it!
Calm down.
I don't want them in my jug.
"Open your mouth, then."
Give him something to aim at.
I don't want your balls in my mouth!
"It might shut you up for once, water boy."
Sorry.
He's been trying to get balls in my jug all day.
I don't care.
Paper balls.
Stop talking.
Water man.
"So, as you can see, the mystery of who pooped the bed has been solved."
"And yes my friends, in a way, you're all guilty."
I did it.
- What?
- I did 'em all.
I did all the poops.
- Really?
"- Yeah, I did everyone of them."
"I even did one, while she was rappin us, right here."
- Dude!
- Jesus!
God!
"Why would you do that, dude?"
Because poop is funny.
I guess poop is very funny.
- Poop is funny.
- He pooped on the floor.
"You know what, well-played my man!"
Well-played!
I hate my life.
"Seriously dude, don't ever poop in our bed again."
How is it on the rooftop?
Door is locked.
Hostage situation.
"Michael, do I wait for you?"
"Don't wait, I'll tell dad!"
"Just $20, 000 in such a high-class restaurant?"
"Well, it's high-class, so we use cards."
Where's the safe?
Open it!
Why would I have the key?
Jim.
"Come on, kids."
Time to go now.
BRlCE:
"I'm sorry, Lutie."
I shouldn't have come back.
I've brought everything to life again.
"And the children, Brice, they don't know me."
I'm not sure they even liked me.
They were just waiting for the time to go home.
They don't need me.
They don't need anything from me.
"Listen to me, Lutie, you and I, we could get Brock."
He's ours.
Let Brewton have Sarah Beth.
We could take Brock away.
He belongs with you and me.
We'd get as far away from here as trains could carry us.
"This is our last chance, Lutie."
The last chance for the three of us.
"I can't go away with you, Brice."
"I can't have Brock and I can't have Sarah Beth so I'm gonna go, but I'll go alone."
And you've got nothing for me;
"Not enough, Brice."
Not enough for that.
Come on in.
Doc.
"Glad Mac got you here, Jim."
Haven't been seeing very much of you lately.
-l haven't been looking for you.
-So I noticed.
I used to love you like the son I never had.
I wasn't okay until now but...
I'll feel better after I meet you.
Actually I'm going out to see my brother.
He's throwing a party today.
Why don't you two come too.
He's invited influential people.
Fine send me the address.
I'll be there.
Okay I'll send it right now.

"Hogarth, we've been through this before."
No pets.
"But he's not a pet, Mom."
He's a friend.
We've got to rent a room if we're gonna make ends meet...
... andnoonewants shredded upholstery.
You won't know he's there.
I'II cage him.
until you feel sorry for him and set him free in the house!
"Do you remember the raccoon, Hogarth?"
I remember the raccoon.
"please, Mom, at Ieast look at him."
AII right.
Where is this guy?
I can't read this handwriting.
"That one should have lettuce, tomato, extra mayo."
"I will go get him, okay?"
So he wants us to hold the mayo and the mustard.
How about just hold the flavor altogether?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Sir?
Excuse me--!
-What's that?
-please don't move.
My pet's under your table.
Don't look!
"If you make a scene, my mom won't let me keep him."
"-What kind of pet, kid?"
-A squirrel.
He's friendly.
"I'm telling the truth, dang it!"
"As long as she's breathing, we've got fate up against the ropes."
There he is.
"All right, so the bike was stolen in Emeryville."
Head back towards the Bay Bridge.
Okay.
There's your man.
Go to the toll plaza.
- There!
- Yes!
"Okay, the wrist."
Can you max that image?
Can I max that image...
"What can you tell from a tattoo, or whatever that is?"
You're looking at a guy that solved a triple murder in Cole Valley off a bent coke spoon.
Can you make that any clearer?
Not with the tools at hand.
"All right, send me a screen cap."
I'll send it to Jenny.
She'll work on it.
Go back to where he stole the bike...
Hollis and 38th.
He had to have put on the helmet somewhere.
"All right, so, here he is at 60th... 57th..."
That's weird.
Okay.
It's okay.
I'll get him at 48th.
Is the camera broken?
"No, they're different cameras."
Go back to 60th.
What?
Somebody's erasing this... right now.
- Me?
- And then he literally zipped his lips and threw away the key.
What's he gonna tell you?
"What, am I a fortune teller?"
You gonna put him in a room with me?
"Stripped, bound, and shackled."
"I told him nobody would be listening, but I was lying."
Man of the hour.
Who's speaking?
You have zero idea what he wants to tell you?
Invite me to Ruby's talent show?
Where are you?
"Market, crossing Geary."
DeBray's in the car ahead of me with Sarneau.
"All right, I'll see you in 30 seconds."
I'm headed out the door.
"If you want to shoot me in the back, my spinal column starts right here."
Get an ambulance!
"Stand back, sir."
"Hey, hey!"
What did you have to tell me?
They stopped looking for... ffor me.
Who did?
Who?
They didn't keep looking...
Who didn't keep looking?
The whole world's looking for you.
Who?
Hey!
Hey!
He...
"He took mine, so I..."
Gray sedan.
New York plates.
I've been a bad mother.
I did a terrible thing to let this happen to you.
It's all my fault.
I have an addiction.
You're so much stronger than I am.
"Time's up, Patrick!"
Drop the weapon!
Yaaah!
"Ok, bet's to you, General."
"All right, I see you and raise you 10 bucks."
"Oh, hell, no."
I'm out.
Too rich for me.
"All right, that general's out."
And the host makes 3.
"Ok, I'm really trying to figure out which one of y'all is bluffing."
The retired marine general of Mr. Rock and Roll hall of fame over here.
This hand's too good to waste on a bluff.
Ooh.
"Is that the lyric to one of yours songs, Joe?"
"All right, I think both of y'all are bluffing."
So here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna see your 10 and I'm gonna raise you 20.
Mm-mm-mm.
What you think about that?
Step up.
Seriously.
"""Never interrupt an enemy when he's making a mistake."""
Ooh!
"Sun Szu, ""Art of War,"""
Leave Franz alone!
"You're in love with him, aren't you?"
"You don't wanna work for me, huh?"
- No!
- Say that again!
Let me go!
"You two, come here!"
"You're my friend, you saved my life."
"Here, take my crown."
"Franz, my dear Franz."
"Hmm, what's up?"
I just don't get this.
"Franz, don't you think we should move somewhere else?"
- Why?
"- I got money, I'll borrow you some."
Why?
I like it here.
You sent that guy away and tonight we're stuck.
We have a replacement.
First-class.
Who?
- He's a decent man.
- You'll see how I'll change his mind.
"I wanna move, to some suburb."
Come in!
"Cilly, a man is waiting outside for you."
Just seeing a tax return paper makes me go crazy.
I just don't know.
"Reinhold lets you know that they need someone tonight, you know the deal."
They want Franz to come over.
Reinhold sent this paper.
He wants you to come over.
So why didn't they--
Why didn't they use Dave?
Because Dave was late to get in makeup.
"But by the time we did the scene, he was ready."
They just said no.
"I don't know, really."
Hi.
"I got you, man."
I got you.
We had people standing by.
We had no idea what we could do without Toxie.
And nobody could call.
But let's just-- can we get past this?
All we did was this long shot with a fucking
Shitload of smoke.
"Yeah, can we do it again with me?"
All right.
Let's see what I can do.
DAVE:
Tell me what you want me to do.
All right.
Trent give me some blocking here.
TRENT HAAGA:
Do you want to pick this one up from that point?
Just have him get up--
Can we just fill him up with smoke
And have him bring the kids on again?
Why?
I don't want to do it again.
-All right.
-Absolutely not.
"In fact, if it happens again, there's gonna"
- (SCOFFS) - (ENGINE STARTS)
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
"All due respect, I am the best equipped to go."
How many wars have you been through?
- My share.
- It should be me.
You?
You haven't fought in a battle.
This is about us getting home to our loved ones.
Why would you...
I have no loved ones.
"If I fail, you can still go on."
It's me.
I'm going and I'm not going to fail.
You're new here.
It's about getting back to Henry.
I don't care what I have to face.
You're not gonna argue with me?
Would it do any good?
No.
You got anything in that bag that's gonna help me with a giant?
Or Hook?
Hey!
Come with me.
This.
Powder made from poppies.
He has to inhale it.
And your sword.
How strong is it?
The most powerful blade in all the realms.
Is it strong enough to cut through that beanstalk?
Indeed.
And no more car privileges.
Give me your keys.
Give 'em to me!
"Oh, for the love of God."
"Mom, you want me to... no."
"Mom, come on, let me just... mom."
Mom!
What is going on with you?
Is this about Allison?
Do you really wanna know?
Yeah.
Is this about your father?
"It is, isn't it?"
"Okay, you know what, um..."
We'll talk about this at home.
I'm gonna go get the car.
I'm the worst son ever.
"Well, I'm not exactly winning any prizes either."
Dammit!
"You give him a restraining order, and he's mocking you!"
He was mo... and what do I do about going to the bathroom?
So why do we need their help?
Because it's harder to kill than I thought.
I still don't know who it is.
And they do?
They might.
Which is why I need one of you to get on their good side.
Scott or Stiles?
Either.
"You know, the full moon's coming, Derek."
I'm aware of that.
These look comfortable.
- It's never been about sex.
I don't understand.
Things were going so well.
Having sex now will ruin everything.
You're a very sick man.
Mmm.
"Johnson's been around both leagues, but seems to have found a home here in the Bronx."
He's leading the American league with a 2.34 ERA and 24 strikeouts.
And strike three.
That makes strikeout number 25 for Johnson in this young season.
- I have the game on for you.
- Oh.
Great.
- Some wine?
- I'll wake up with a headache.
- One glass.
"- All right, one glass."
Same score?
This is good.
Sweet.
I normally don't like sweet.
I'm glad you like it.
Do you...
Would you mind terribly if we muted the TV?
- What are you doing?
- Nothing much.
All right.
Would it be all right if I sat down?
- The wine made me warm.
- I can fix that.
- Good game?
- I can't hear.
"Jenny, can't talk now."
I'm in trouble with your dad and it is a lot worse than all of the other times.
I'm going to have to be off the grid for a little while.
"Nick, Nick, I've got some big news!"
"He's not done something stupid, has he?"
"Oh, god!"
I'll never be able to forgive myself.
"Nick, Nick, I'm having a baby!"
Nick?
"Jenny, that's brilliant!"
I'm so pleased for you!
"It is mine, yeah?"
"Yeah, of course."
Icing on the cake.
That is fantastic.
I'm going to come straight home.
I'll be with you as soon as I can.
Where are you?
"Where are we, lad?"
Half an hour now.
We'll be getting into *** in about two hours.
"I'll buddy up with a trucker, or something."
I'm going to be with you ASAP.
Synced by slake
Previously on Grimm...
No!
What have you done?
I don't have any powers.
You've taken everything.
Farley Kolt.
- Put the coins on the bed.
- I have the rights to adoption.
- Never!
Thanks for freeing me.
I had no means... to get out.
Carry your papers... and no one will hassle you.
I didn't know that.
"It won't happen again, brother."
Have you finished?
- Have some more.
- I'm full.
You can always eat a little more.
- Have a roll.
"- I can't, really."
Try the salad.
Don't refuse everything.
Have some fruit.
I'll have a banana.
- I'm leaving now.
- Already?
"Wait for me, I'll wash my hands."
"As I foresaw, your employment has been arranged."
Come to the factory tomorrow.
There's no need for a ride.
- How will you go back?
"- On foot, as usual."
- I'll show you out.
- Don't bother.
Good evening!
Balla!
They set you free?
My boss paid for me.
Liar!
Why don't you drive it?
"Well, it doesn't run."
"I mean, at least not that I could figure out."
Why would you keep a car that doesn't run?
- Be more of a girl right now.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Why don't you come take a look at this?
"Elena, remember the old Camaro your dad used to have?"
Of course.
- I built and rebuilt that engine 20 times.
- Wow.
"Well, I don't like sports cars."
They're too hard to make out in.
"No, it wasn't that bad."
"- I'm sorry, man."
"- No, no."
Don't worry about it.
"You and Elena, you guys have a history and ignoring it doesn't do anybody any good."
She's good with you.
"You know, I wasn't sure, but she's happy and I'm glad."
"All right, let's take a look at this."
Ouch.
Damn it.
- Need some help?
- Damn it.
Stupid shoe.
Ugh.
Pick up your other foot.
Ahem.
There you go.
Thanks.
I think.
Get out!
Get out!
I helped you!
Out!
Shame on you!
You rat!
You swine!
Get out!
"""She's so gentle, so faithful..."""
I almost killed you... like I killed Ida.
"I want to go straight, but it's too hard."
Guys like me never get a break.
I'm going for a drive in the country with Karl.
I'm tired of doing nothing.
We've got some accounts to settle in Weissensee.
Ede and Biberkopf have to go along.
- You're taking Franz?
- Yeah.
When will you be back?
Tonight at the earliest.
All right.
"Hello, young lady."
My friend Biberkopf sent me with a message.
He'll be home late tonight.
He asked you to come by?
Not exactly.
I just thought I'd come over and patch things up from last night.
- What do you really want?
- I told you!
"And there's nothing wrong with calling on a pretty girl, is there?"
"I thought, ""It's a beautiful day."
"Let's drive out into the country."""
"Mom, Dad, you did all the hard work getting me through high school."
You deserve a gift.
But what do you get the Cadillac of parents?
A Rolls-Royce.
"Oh, my goodness!"
How did you afford that?
"- It was only $2,000."
- Huh.
"Judge Thompson, from the club,"
- got me into a police auction.
- Huh.
"If I had 40 more dollars, you'd be looking at a speedboat."
"So, what do you think?"
It's... it's wow.
- Right?
!
"- I loved the macaroni necklace he made me in first grade, and I even used the perfume he gave me in fifth grade, but this car is so gaudy."
People are gonna think I played for the Knicks in the '70s.
It's the most beautiful gesture
- I have ever seen.
- (car door opens)
It's 100% class.
"Hey, Mom, didn't you say you had some errands to run?"
Oh.
I... in a little while.
"Uh, yeah."
"But... um, gosh, it's got fur."
Wow.
It's like driving a lion.
"Hey, before you go, give us a honk."
All right.
"(horn honks to the tune of ""We're in the Money"")"
"- Yeah, why do you care?"
You only get to do a first date once.
It should be... fun and sexy and...
ask really good questions.
Ask him why he first decided he wanted to save lives.
"Ooh, ask him what his best surgery ever was."
I know how to go on a date.
Why is Meredith eating pot roast?
It's a show lunch for the mommy.
She's freaking out.
That ponytail?
It's gonna blow.
"Derek tells me you--you, uh, grew up right here in Seattle."
Are your parents...
"Mm, dead."
Mer's mother died last year.
"Oh, I'm so sorry."
And your father?
Oh.
"You know, I should go check on the patient who's the serial killer."
Who's here.
"Not killing people, so that's good."
- I should go.
- Yeah.
"Family isn't her favorite topic, okay?"
She's had a rough time of it.
- I didn't say a word.
- I know what you're thinking.
I was thinking...
It must be awful for you.
Treating a murderer.
Dad died a long time ago.
Of course I am.
I'm fine.
"Hey, Mom."
Mom.
"Hey, Mom."
What?
I'm trying to sleep.
"Uh, I was just making sure you're alive."
"I'm sorry, sweetie, it was a late night."
My head is throbbing.
"Yeah, um, I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't bring the party home."
I'm sure the neighbors would appreciate it.
It wasn't a party.
It was one guy.
Don't be so judgy.
"Yeah, well, I talked to Roberta at the Grill."
And there's still a bartending position open if you wanted to get a job.
"Well, I figured she'd still be pissed about the last time I worked there."
I think she's desperate.
I'll check it out.
- Yeah?
- Don't act so surprised.
I just...
I didn't know how long you planned on sticking around.
"- Well, there is back rent due."
"- There's back everything, Mom."
"Like I said, I'll check it out."
- Who's that?
- It's Caroline.
Easy.
Yeah.
Come in.
I'm only asking you to do it so that you can have the success you deserve.
Every bit of it.
Blake Carrington's a very smart man.
He'd know the difference.
Not if you control yourself.
Just joking.
"Now, don't be upset."
I thought you loved me.
"I'm sorry, it was-"
It was only an idea.
Bad idea.
You're right.
Sleeping with him is too risky.
"Anyway, I want you for myself."
Believe that.
Oh.
L.B.
What are you doing here?
"It's the man's birthday today, and that kiss was his present."
That damned kid.
He follows me everywhere.
What if he tells somebody about what he just saw?
"That is a problem, isn't it?"
"Well, why don't you just see to it that he doesn't?"
Mother.
Welcome home.
Adam.
Mm.
I can't tell you how proud I am of you.
And happy to be working together again?
Yes.
"Oh, what have we here?"
Hi.
Good morning.

What is this?
Noona's has work now so I won't be able to take care of you as often.
So eat a lot.
Your sister wasn't even able to sleep last night because she was preparing all this.
So eat up and go to school already.
I'm so sad.
What's with you face.
Your friends don't give you food at their house?
Noona.
Ah for real.
If your that worried why don't you follow him with a bowl.
-She kissed me.
-That makes me feel so much better!
-lt didn't mean anything!
-The hug or the kiss?
-Neither.
-lt meant your arms around her body.
-lt meant her tongue in your throat.
"-Well, it was her tongue- l don't wanna hear this!"
-Sorry.
Stop.
-Let go of me.
-Just listen to me.
Why should I?
You lied to me.
-l didn't think it would happen again.
-You were wrong.
-l didn't want to embarrass her.
"-What are you talking about, Pacey?"
This your boss hitting on you.
"If you wanted to stop it, you could have."
And you didn't because you like it.
You are attracted to her and-- lt's really obvious to me.
"If you didn't want her to hit on you, why didn't you quit?"
Because maybe I need this job.
I'm not exactly rolling in money here.
I can't afford a place to live.
I'm not a rich college girl who can quit when the mood strikes me.
That's cool.
You know what?
"Screw the girl, keep your job."
Have your cake and eat it too. lt's fine!
You're still here.
"It's all right, Bobby."
We're here together.
"Go to sleep, Bobby."
Go back to sleep.
"It's all right, Bobby."
It's all right.
Go back to sleep.
We're here together.
I think we could all use one of those.
Mr. Gordon?
Shall we go into the other room?
Let's go.
Get started on the clock.
"Stan and I had a brother, Bobby."
He was younger than either of us.
Not quite 7 when he died.
Stan and I were 12 and 14.
We lived in a big house with grounds that bordered a river.
"That particular day, our mother asked us to stay at home and look after Bobby."
We wanted to go swimming.
"What we wanted to do, Bobby wanted to do, naturally."
He idolised his big brothers.
"So we told him to stay in the house, and off we went."
He followed us.
We were pretty far out when we spotted him.
He was trying to...
To get to us.
He still is.
- You mean it's his...?
- Spirit?
Ghost?
"I don't know, Mr. Gordon."
- Eventually.
"But for now, we keep a low profile."
- No one knows who I am.
- The Salvatore brothers do.
And I wish to hell I could run into them.
They're the reason we were caught in the first place.
"So, uh, Matt, how do you like working here?"
"Uh, it's not that bad."
Wait staff tips out pretty good.
They can't keep a bartender to save their lives but...
I actually put my mom up for the job.
"How's that been, having Kelly back?"
"You know, same old Kelly."
"She's trying, sort of."
Kelly and my mom were best friends growing up.
That's how Matt and I first met.
We shared a crib together.
You're kidding.
"No, we've known each other our whole lives."
Whoo!
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Little Jen.
"- Oh, my God."
I know.
- It's big Jen now.
Let's have another one.
How many is that?
Ha-ha-ha.
Where are you going?
Bethanne and I are going out for a bit.
Hit the town.
Kick up our heels.
So you come along for her friend.
See?
I knew it.
I knew it.
What the fuck is wrong with that?
When is it?
Tomorrow night.
I'm meeting Tuddy.
You could meet Tuddy.
Come early and then go.
Why do you always do this?
Don't give me that shit.
What did I ask you for?
A favor.
I do a lot of fucking favors for you.
I'm trying to bang this broad.
Help me out.
I don't understand you.
She's beautiful!
Her family lives in the Five Towns.
These Jews got money.
Maybe the family owns the whole block.
You may wind up with a big score.
You with your fucking mouth!
I had a meeting with Tuddy at 11:00 and here I am a backup guy for Tommy.
Did you have enough to eat?
It was delicious.
I'm just watching my diet.
Let me watch your figure.
I couldn't wait to go.
I was ordering dessert when they were eating dinner.
I was asking for the check.
What time is it?
It's almost fucking 10 o'clock.
How's it going?
"Well, we haven't got a shot off yet."
This is exciting.
The script is exciting.
I loved it.
"-Oh, I'm glad you liked it."
I loved it.
I thought it was so funny.
It's so funny.
So you liked the script?
"You think it's as good as ""Shakespeare in Love""?"
"Oh, much better."
"When you're not busy, could me and him talk to you?"
Sure.
Because he has something pretty big going on.
"-Oh, yeah?"
-Yeah.
Pretty big?
"Well, I ought to hear about it right now."
He wants to make a movie?
Yeah?
He's making a book right now.
Uh-huh.
And he has his own characters and everything.
And he wanted to know if he could make a movie out of it.
Why not?
"Just keep-- you have to have, like, a script or something."
You got to get some money.
You have to raise money.
You need money to make a movie.
Little?
Any newbie can do it.
It will make no difference.
"How can you say that, Je?"
No difference?
It was a simple little job.
Be reasonable.
You turned off your mobile for half a day.
What was I supposed to do?
I had to fix it.
You weren't here.
Are you seeing someone now?
The hell!
Have you ever seen me with a girl?
No.
"But if you do, that's cool."
But turning off your cell phone.
That's too much.
"Normally you're more professional than this, you know?"
It's good that I noticed it first.
How could you miss that?
Even I noticed it.
"""Normally you're more professional than this, you know?"""
Shit!
It's not going away.
Not better.
So tired.
A waste of time.
What am I doing?
Hold on.
Shit!
November.
- What's your name?
- Tia.
- I'm Rocky.
- I'm muscles.
- Crusher.
- And I'm dazzler.
We're the earthquake gang.
Does that scare you?
No.
Let's change our name again.
We gotta have a name that scares.
Yeah.
How'd you do what you done?
"Well, I really didn't do anything."
Yeah.
You a magician or something?
No.
You want to join our gang?
I'm sorry.
I'm looking for someone.
- Thanks anyway.
"- Aw, sure."
I guess you're like the rest of them.
You've heard we're a nothing gang.
"Yeah, well we ain't always gonna be nothing."
Someday we're gonna be the toughest.
Take over the whole territory.
Someday they're gonna run when they see us coming down the block.
All right.
It's just that I've got to find my brother.
What gang does he belong to?
He doesn't belong to any gang.
We've got to get it back.
Get it back?
It's absolutely a matter of life and death.
"Well, how do I pull the check out of the bank?"
"You know the manager of the bank, don't you?"
Yes.
Tell him you want it back.
"But that's highly irregular, I..."
"Look, get me that check back and I'll give you $5.000."
"Well, I'll try."
"I don't guarantee anything, but I'll try."
I'll be waiting for you in the coffee shop.
"Something else, sir?"
"Another cup of coffee, please."
You've had six.
"Well, make it seven."
"Yes, sir."
Hello?
This is Mr. Sabourin.
Has Mr. O'Hara come back yet?
"No, sir, he hasn't."
"By the way, Mr. Sabourin, Wentworth Drug is up two more points."
Isn't that nice?
"Yes, yes, thank you."
Well?
Let's talk about me.
What do I get?
What do you mean?
$5.000.
"Oh, no."
"No, Mr. Sabourin."
That check was stubbed.
Really?
I don't know.
I think the truth kind of gets you in trouble.
You know what you should do?
Find your dad one of those nice women that we saw in town.
Nice women don't understand him.
I don't even understand him.
"He spends all of his time wading around in mud, cataloging plants."
Good night.
Use the can if you need anything.
Can?
Looks like a boob.
"Hello, V?"
V.
"V, this is Frank."
From the can.
This is V.
My dad thinks you look like Grace Kelly.
Good night.
"Good night, Frank."
"I'm telling you, she slept in the tree house last night."
You're so full of shit.
"Oh, my God-- a ""C."""
My dad is going to kill me.
"What's wrong with a ""C""?"
Her car broke down in front of my house.
She had to stay.
She's there right now.
"She's going to tell on us, I know."
She's not there.
I bet you a zillion billion dollars that you are full of shit.
You're on.
Boy:
Shake it!
Shake it!
Shake it!
But Jules and Laurie are!
What?
How?
We're going in!
"Laurie, this is why I love you!"
I can do anything when I'm with--
Laurie?
[ Gasps ]
♪♪
Alone in a dance circle.
No way out.
Unless I get tough and dance my way out.
[ Cheering ]
No.
I'm gonna die in here.
"All right, we have to move fast."
We don't know who's behind this and we don't know who their target is.
"But in a pantsing plot, the story's always the same."
Jerks versus dorks.
You find the losers here and get them to safety.
I'll sniff out the punks and the troublemakers.
"But mark my words, by 11:00, all dorks pants will be standing."
[ Sighs ] God help us.
"Oh, Ellie, while you're out there wading through all the jerks, please stay focused."
You know how you get weak around bad boys.
"Oh, please."
No one here is over 18.
"Oh, that guy looks like he's over 18."
"- You'll be my slave, then."
- Are you a Traoré?
"If I had known,"
I'd have carried the two sacks on my head.
"Traoré, do you have a new slave?"
Rather he has a new master.
All right.
I'll pay you tomorrow in front of the factory.
Ok.
See you!
"Don't go yet, little slave!"
Come with me to the Bozola Co-op.
The sale is over.
Impossible!
We need rice!
There's no more left...
No more for sale.
That's the last sack.
We're out of stock.
We're out of rice.
"Balla, let's go back!"
Come!
Boss!
"Don't call me boss, call me Balla Traoré."
I wanted a leave permit.
Did you get someone to replace you?
Then tell your boss that I sent you.
"Traoré, the boss is looking for you."
I'm going to get my rice.
That's your problem.
Get to work.
You screwed up with that part.
I don't believe such a place exists.
Where is this?
What are you talking about?
The city.
We're not allowed to go to the city.
In the city there are no rules.
"Everything is possible, and everything is available for a price."
"Lucky for us, our needs are small."
What are our needs?
T o see a woman naked.
Let me see the money.
"Come on, let me see the money."
The money.
Let me see the money.
The money.
Keep it moving.
"Come on, come on, give me the money."
"All right, come on."
Keep it running smoothly.
Looks beautiful on you.
Give me the money.
Thank you.
That sure is a lot of milk money.
"Kevin, some things are more important than milk, all right?"
"Well, what do you need all this money for, anyway?"
"Oh, we're going to buy a pros thetic leg."
For his dog.
His dog lost his leg.
"So, what'd you tell your dad?"
I said I was eating at Kevin's house.
I said I was eating at Brad's house.
I said I was eating at Frank's house.
"I don't know about you, but I'm starved."
"I'm so hungry, I could eat a horse."
"This place, it's probably on the menu."
[woman laughs]
Come on.
"Hey, what's the joke here?"
Are you hungry enough to eat a horse?
"Uh, you bet."
"This place, it's probably on the menu."
"Well, we'll work on it."
"I'll tell you, Billy, the red chili's the best thing they have here."
When you eat it you feel like you're out on the range eating' off a chuck wagon.
"I want a hamburger, fries, and a Coke."
"Howdy, folks."
Hi.
- Having a good trip?
- Yep.
"I'm Hal, I'll be your waiter."
Yeah.
"And, uh, have you decided what you'd like?"
"Uh, not quite."
"Well, take your time."
We got nothing but time in the off-season.
Billy?
"Billy, bet I know what you'd like."
[coughs]
"You'd like a burger, French fries, and a Coke."
Yeah.
[whispers] Yeah.
That's right.
- And I guess we'll have the chili?
- Yep.
I came all the way here to make a deal.
Jumong?
I might be in hiding but I still know what's going on.
Jumong can't leave Jolbon because of the blockade.
Why would he come here?
We have our reasons.
Daesan.
Yes?
Bring me a big jar of wine.
"Yes, sir."
Let's see if you are who you claim to be.
Drink this.
Drink up!
Tie him to that tree.
"Yes, sir."
I heard Jumong is a master archer.
Shoot that target next to him.
Don't just stand there.
Hurry up!
I don't like playing games.
"If you don't believe me, just kill me instead."
"If you're going to die anyway, shouldn't you die trying?"
I'll let you live if you hit the target.
Commander!
Shoot.
You must be Okjuh soldiers.
Kill them!
Why won't you believe us?
This is Commander Jumong!
- He is!
- Shut up!
It's the army!
He burned them.
Where?
Where?
In the kitchen.
Bastard!
You!
What did you come here to do?
What did you come here to do?
Ask him again.
What did you come here to do?
To travel.
"To travel, he says."
Tell him I'll throw him in jail if he doesn't fess up.
Tell us the truth.
"Even if I told you, you wouldn't believe me."
He says you wouldn't believe him.
"Look, you translate everything I say,"
- word for word.
"- Yes, sir."
You fucking prick!
Oh...
"You loose-assed, dog-fucking son of a whore!"
"So, uh..."
What kind of tourist hangs pictures of dead people on his wall?
Travel... the dead...
Why was this in your house?
How did this...?
Who the fuck are you?
Who are you?
I know what you're doing in this village.
I saw that room.
And I know what the fuck you're doing to my daughter!
Come in.
Merry Christmas.
It's been a long time.
It is Christmas.
You don't have to explain a gift.
Thank you.
Come in.
Let me take your coat.
I can only stay a moment.
I have to deliver a few more things.
- Can I fix you a drink?
"- No, thank you."
"Well, come in, sit down."
"Well, I really came to... ."
Is it true that you might go to Portland?
"Well, I've received the offer."
"It's a larger school, and naturally, much more money."
- You'll take it.
- I don't know.
I have a week to make up my mind.
Sit down.
- Michael?
- Yes?
You were right.
I never thought I could say it but you were right.
- About what?
"During the past months, I've been able to come to a few conclusions about myself."
- And what were they?
"- Well, Michael, I've lied so long."
"I was everything you said, especially that night in the kitchen."
I wanted you more than you wanted me.
- I had no right to say those things.
Where are the shovels?
It's Karen Hill. I want to talk to you.
Hello?
Don't hang up on me!
I want to talk to you!
"You keep away from my husband, you hear me?"
Open the door!
Answer me!
"I'm gonna tell everyone who walks in this building that in 2R, Rossi, you are nothing but a whore!"
Is this the superintendent?
"Yes, I want you to know sir, that you have a whore living in 2R!"
"Rossi, Janice Rossi."
Do you hear me?
He's my husband!
Get your own goddamn man!
"Wake up, Henry."
What are you doing?
"Karen, what are you, crazy?"
"Yeah, I""m crazy."
And I'm crazy enough to kill the both of you.
"Karen, take it easy."
Do you love her?
Do you?
I love you.
You know I love you.
You don't.
"No, you don't."
"Be careful, baby."
Don't.
How could I hurt him?
I couldn't even bring myself to leave him.
The truth was that no matter how bad I felt I was still very attracted to him.
"Here, in my head."
What's your name?
You don't want to tell me!
What about you?
How old are you?
I see.
You're not very talkative!
Are you hungry?
Thirsty?
Good that's a start!
But I would like to hear the sound of your voice.
Maybe you aren't able to speak!
Is that it?
Are you mute?
"Poor wretches, they are mute!"
"Monique, bring them some grenadine."
I understand.
You have to leave.
Let me look at you a while longer.
I'm afraid I may never see you again.
"Listen, I would never betray you."
You can always think of me as a friend!
Are you afraid of those girls?
Cowards.
Coward
You're running away.
You're terrified.
I'm not afraid of them.
I'm going.
I'll bring you back their heads.
Where are they?
- I'm not afraid.
- That's it!
That was one close finish.
You sure made Dinoco proud.
"Thank you, King."
"Well, Tex, you've been good to me all these years."
It's the least I could do.
"Whatever happens, you're a winner to me, you old daddy rabbit."
"Thanks, dear."
Wouldn't be nothing without you.
Kch-i-ka-chow!
- I'm Mia.
- I'm Tia.
"We're, like, your biggest fans!"
Ka-chow!
I love being me.
"- OK, girls, that's it."
"- We love you, Lightning!"
"Hey, buddy."
You're one gutsy racer.
"Oh, hey, Mr. The King."
You got more talent in one lug nut than a lot of cars has got in their whole body.
- Really?
"Oh, that..."
- But you're stupid.
- Excuse me?
"- This ain't a one-man deal, kid."
You need to wise up and get a good crew chief and a good team.
"You ain't gonna win unless you got good folks behind you, and you let them do their job, like they should."
- Like I tell the boys at the shop...
- A good team.
Yeah...
Ka-chow!
You have company.
Just texting my girlfriends.
It's time for me to leave.
"Oh, It's only 9:00."
"We could have some coffee, watch a movie."
More cake?
"Oh, the cake was awesome."
"But really, I don't want to overstay my welcome, so, Dylan, do you want to walk me to the door?"
"Go ahead, Dylan."
Go ahead.
Of course.
What are you doing?
Ben has been waiting for hours.
"Oh, I doubt it."
You doubt it?
"Okay, let me rephrase that."
I don't care.
I don't care about Ben.
I care about you.
And I did see you first at that party and I am really smitten with you.
And I'm angry with myself for stepping aside for my friend.
You slept with Ben's wife that night.
"Yeah, I did."
"And it was a huge mistake, huge."
"But stepping aside, huger mistake."
He doesn't deserve you.
He's in love with Amy.
"He's always been in love with Amy, so don't waste your time."
And I hope you'll give me a chance.
"Good night, Robert."
"Good night, Cecilia."
BOTH:
Now I understand why that ACP let me go.
So that the Boss can kill you?
So what are you waiting for?
Come on kill me.
Not even your father...
Don't speak about my father!
Because I can endure anything.
But I can never endure anyone abusing my father.
'I can endure anything.'
'But if anyone abuses my father.'
'I cannot endure that.'
Brother!
I'm your brother.
I want to hug you bro.
But... the rascal on the left keeping an eye on us.
Look.
Dad.
The Boss has Shiv in his grip.
Yes.
He's too good.
Now play along with me.
But I can't act.
That's the problem with you new-comers.
That's why I've come prepared.
Look.
Take a good look.
Look.
- This is the lion's paw.
- Yes.
If that's a paw... then I have a strong hand.
And when I pound someone with this... he never gets up again.
Strong arm!
- I'm concerned about this one child...
- Shut up!
"Respectfully, all right?"
"Respectfully, shut up."
Because we've got organs.
"I whish we could get organs delivered, instead of having to pick them up, you know?"
I hate flying.
"I always feel much closer to death on a plane than in the OR, don't you?"
I do now.
I met Izzie the other day.
She's very pretty.
So you--you think she's the one?
I-I don't know.
"Well, I mean, we're at that age, right?"
"Marriage, babies..."
That the plan?
I don't know!
I'm sorry.
"I-I don't make plans, okay?"
"If there's a future there, great."
"If not, whatever."
I'll get over it.
I always do.
Okay?
Okay.
I think it's nice.
Your date.
I think you and the pig murderer make a really good couple.
Okay.
What are you gonna do on your date?
What are you ganna talk about?
- Why do you care?
Who asked you to lie?
They asked where my uncle was.
I said that he'd left.
They asked how he was and you said he'd left.
We don't want anything from your uncle.
They asked me.
I said that he had left.
They asked how she was.
It wasn't about your uncle.
Have they taught you anything at school?
Yes.
You don't give an answer until you're asked a question.
"Yes, I've been taught that."
I don't want any more bread.
You understand?
"If you have good news, come here."
"If not, don't bother coming back!"
All right.
- Understand?
- Yes.
Put the bread down there and go.
"Hello, engineer."
My mother wants to know if you want the milk cold or hot.
Warm it up.
Good day.
"There's nothing more to say, Mrs Godarzi."
As I told you before.
"No, it's the same."
What?
"No, we don't know what to do."
What does that mean?
"That's impossible, Mrs Godarzi."
- He can find himself another hit man.
- I'm sure.
- I'll tell if you tell me.
- No!
"OK, kids, lunch is ready!"
You should get yourself a new map.
No.
This is my only school prize.
- The names are out of date.
- I know.
The old maps are the best.
The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics - that's a brilliant name for a country.
Are you gonna talk to me?
What do you want to know?
How did you get out so early?
Where are you living?
What are you gonna do with your life?
I'm out on licence.
I'm living in a kind of halfway house.
My life
"- I don't know, Jess."
I need some more time on that one.
- Is that it?
- Course it's not it.
- I did it for you.
- No.
I killed them for you.
- You did it for yourself.
"- Why did you write to me, then, Jess?"
Because I love you and you were the only person I could turn to.
"You're all I've got right now, Jess."
Promise me you won't go away again?
"Give us back our jobs, you arsehole."
Not now you all hate me.
The workers united will never be defeated!
..cheaper grain.
When do we want it?
Now!
What do we want?
Cheaper grain!
When do we want it?
Now!
Delphine?
What are you doing here?
"What are you doing here, Marcus?"
You said you'd cut grain prices and then you raised them!
I had to!
"Can you not protest against me, please?"
Why would you do that?
"Because he's looking after himself and his cronies, love."
"Mate, I'm trying to have a conversation with my girlfriend."
You go out with this arsehole?
"I do, yes."
And stop calling me that!
You could do a lot better!
Thank you.
"Shut up, please."
I'd dump him.
Dump him!
Dump him!
Dump him!
Dump him!
Dump him!
"I mean, this is not how I thought today would go."
Let's go.
"No, no."
We can't do that.
"What, you got a better idea?"
"Come on, dad, our window's closing, and we need to dine and dash now."
"Excuse me, sir."
Sir!
Wow.
I can't believe you did that.
"Yeah, neither can I."
That is so not you.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
"So, where are you and Martin going?"
Dad.
What?
"Come on, I don't wanna talk about that."
"We're just gonna fight, ok?"
"Forget it, then."
It's ok.
"Well, I should get back."
"Oh, Martin said that you had 'till 5:00, right?"
"Sarah, I really just... just wanna tag along with you, see how you spend your time."
I'm not gonna interfere.
"I'll just sit there, won't say a word."
What is it you think I do?
Steal cars?
Vandalize private property?
Beg?
"Sarah, I have no idea what you do... and that's why I'm asking."
This is a life drawing class.
"Yeah, sorry to disappoint."
But you can tell me some of the stuff you write about.
What for?
You wouldn't understand.
Why wouldn't I?
Because you live different.
That's true.
But I've also lived like you.
I also wrote in my diary.
Do you still have it?
I've lost it.
But do you remember the things you wrote?
Some of them.
Tell me.
See how one can't tell a thing about that?
It must've been too boring.
Why?
I remember how I wrote the things that happened to me.
For example:
"""I woke up at 8."
"It was cold."""
The bed was warm.
"""I was almost late... because Jacoba took too long to make breakfast."""
Things like that.
I've dreamt about dogs.
-With dogs?
Yes.
That happened very often.
I saw a square full of dogs.
"They moved, sniffed around..."
There wasn't any people.
Only dogs!
"And sometimes, me."
"Cover him, Ria."
Mr. de Vries... you're a doctor.
Mr. Reve!
Calm down.
What a shame we have to meet here.
Tension gauge.
Life takes strange turns.
I didn't know you were a doctor.
That's why matters of life and death interest me.
Bloem!
"Thinking of death I cannot sleep, remember?"
How is he?
How's Herman?
- He's in very bad shape.
- Dead?
Yes.
A friend of yours?
A relative?
The fourth man!
I told him but he wouldn't believe me.
"Doctor, the liver."
"Now Herman can go into a vase too, he can..."
- Enlarged but intact.
- Normal reflexes.
- She's done it again.
- You've had a lucky escape.
But she's done it again the fourth man.
She takes him like a spider a spider also fucks her mate and then devours him... dead!
Quite a shock for you.
"Keep on talking, it'll settle you down."
"She's a spider, a witoh."
She leads men to ruin.
Hey.
Constantino and those trucks are right on your doorstep.
You don't have much time.
What about that train?
"20 minutes, give or take."
"Tell me you have a plan, a really good one."
"Hey, I need to borrow your tank."
It won't fire.
"I told you that, right?"
There's not a single round of ammo in it.
I'm not planning on shooting anything.
"Uh, the throttle's there on your left."
"And to steer, you're just gonna..."
Hey.
This is not my first time.
Jake.
Good luck out there.
Yeah.
"You, too."
"Any minute now, huh?"
Yeah.
"I'm, uh..."
"You know, he's here, watching."
"You know that, right?"
They still doing the bunny hop in there?
I think it's the Macarena.
The what?
"Yeah, they're still doing the bunny hop."
Quite a speech you made in there.
I had no idea you were such a sentimental fool.
Mom wrote it.
You think?
- You sure?
- Yeah.
No.
It's a laminate.
- That's not real hardwood floor?
- Nope.
It looks exactly like it.
But it is like one one-hundredth of the cost.
Oh.
I still wanna go with the real wood.
What?
You can't even tell the difference.
It's not the point.
"Well, what is the point?"
I just...
I don't like the way it's pretending to be wood.
"If you're not wood, don't try and look like wood."
I don't think that it's pretending.
"This is a lie, Ben."
Just be up front and tell people what you really are.
"Okay, you're right."
You're right.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Maybe we should just go look at the grills and we'll come back.
Okay.
I slept with someone.
- I said...
- I heard you.
You tell me this in Home Depot because you know I hate a public scene.
"No, that is not why I'm telling..."
I knew it.
He sees you and loves you.
Where is our mother?
Don't you know yourself when you have to urinate?
We can't help you with that.
Hello?
Untie me.
Now clean the bed.
Take the sheets off.
"Come on, get them off."
Elias?
Where is our mother?
"Elias, come here."
Where is she?
All right.
"Elias, let's make a deal."
I'll play the game again.
I will talk again to Lukas.
Lukas will live again.
"I'll make breakfast for the both of you, ready your clothes."
"We do everything again, as before."
But you have to believe me that I am your mother.
And you honestly want to do that?
I promise.
Elias ...
It's not your fault that Lukas died.
The accident was not your fault.
Do you really believe her?
She's lying.
Let her prove that she is our mother.
What do I do now?
What is Lukas now doing?
But I can't see him!
"My love, you got me spinning like a wind-up toy"
"# Hot kiss, won't you tell me what you miss, boy?"
"# My love, you got me spinning like a wind-up toy"
"# You can't knock it, or rock it, or be-bop it"
# It's an itch you can't scratch Nothing's gonna stop it...
Oh... you're up.
I thought I'd bring you a cup of tea.
"Er... come and sit down, Tom."
There's... something I'd better tell you.
"I'm going to divorce you, Tommy 'cause I want to get married again."
He's...
He's a good man.
He lives in the next village.
He's a plumber.
"Oh, come on."
You didn't think I wanted to grow old on my own.
"Well, speak to me, then."
I'll bring this in to Frances.
She'll probably be glad of a cuppa.
"- Frances, can I come in?"
- No.
Go away.
"Oh, please."
"Hear me out, Frankie, will you?"
I brought a nice cup of...
- Did you listen?
I said no.
- Please.
I just want to talk.
Huh?
Here...
I don't know where to start.
Mommy just has to have some tests done.
That's all.
There are more schnitzels in the fridge.
I'll make some.
Leave her be.
Have a seat.
I'd rather stand.
Would you like something to drink?
- No.
How's your father?
He's in the hospital.
- What's wrong?
Do you really care?
Yes.
I saw a picture of the musical in the hallway.
You and Dad are embraced.
How idyllic.
"That's all over, Goni."
All the big hits in this theater were his.
His name is on half of the posters in the hallway.
No one can take away the credit for the things he did.
"Yes, but no one's giving him any work either."
Including you.
How old are you?
25.
Why?
Did you know that my son is 21?
"I came to talk about Dad, not your son."
Do you know how long he's out of work?
I know.
You used to be friends.
There are things you don't know.
Your old man gonna be okay with this?
Don't worry about him.
He's fine.
"Yeah, I won't worry about him when he's ripping my fucking dick off."
Do you need me to sign something?
Good.
Relax.
"Look what you're doing with your shoulders, right?"
It's...
- Right?
- Okay.
Don't be wild.
And turn it over.
Nice and relaxed.
"Yeah, we're having fun."
You're not leaving yourself any room.
"So, what is she doing wrong?"
You need to stay back.
You're crowding your punch.
Crowding your punch.
"You come in here, you're not getting the full extension."
Right.
"The first one is here, here, and here."
You know what it's setting up?
"- Look what's coming, right?"
- Mm-hmm.
"If you throw it and you stay there, what's gonna happen?"
"I'm gonna knock you the fuck out, all right?"
Good.
"Come on, move."
Move.
Here I come.
"Rose, I came by your office today for lunch, but you weren't there."
- Were you at a staff meeting?
- I had lunch with Henry.
"Rose, he's a friend of mine, but you have to watch out for him."
"Believe me, I'm not his type."
He has trouble controlling himself.
- Oh.
- What?
What?
What?
- Did you pull something?
- I think so.
Right here.
A little lower.
Lower.
Closer to the spine.
There.
"Oh, yeah."
Lean back into it.
I thought you might like to meet me in Europe after your classes end.
We never had a honeymoon.
That's right.
I would love that.
- Would you?
- Mmm.
- Am I pressing too hard?
"- No, but I'm all sweaty."
And I have to floss.
"When you've got to floss, you've got to floss."
"Claire, I don't know how to ask for it."
"We're so polite, I feel like we're roommates in a charm school."
- I'm putting you on the speaker.
"Sure, but do you ever do anything about it?"
I lay them by the dozen if need be.
Don't you?
What do you think I did with Chrissy last night?
But Christine has often walked down the aisle.
Never had any luck.
Take me to the studios some time.
Stupid bitoh!
Wait... stop!
Stop!
You got something going with her?
!
I saw that woman in a dream!
Ma'am!
"Nothing, I guess."
Probably screwing on some tombstone.
I read about them: cemetery whores.
- Damn weather!
- There!
We'll get soaked.
- That one's open!
- ln that tomb?
!
"Dead men don't bite, only live ones do."
Do you want to get hit?
It wouldn't be the first time.
- But you won't.
- Won't I?
No.
Do you think I'll like it?
I'm gonna try...
"Keep going, Gerard."
That's why I wanted to retire.
Sorry.
"No, I'm sorry."
"I'm so sorry, Blair."
"Look, I shouldn't a..."
I shouldn't have pushed us to do all those jobs.
I shouldn't have gone back into that fucking house.
I should have put you first.
Hello friends!
Are we having fun yet?
"Listen, this is what's gonna happen, all right."
"They're gonna come in, I'm gonna lure them away, you find a safe place to hide until somebody gets here."
I'm not leaving you.
"No, they're gonna come for the sheriff, so you gotta stay alive until then."
We have to stay together.
Please.
Please.
"You have to swear to me that you'll run and hide, okay?"
Swear to me.
"It's the only way, Blair."
"Blair, come on, you know it's the only way."
Okay.
Okay.
"I love you, okay."
Get ready to run and hide.
Oh Jesus!
Get back.
"Oh my God, Connor."
Ow.
Sorry.
"Come on, hurry."
"Go downstairs, go downstairs."
Who are you?
I can't see very well.
Shall I read for you?
I'm a cop.
Pardon?
How can I help you?
This fabric isn't so fire resistant.
They're my family.
My blood.
We have to practice thoroughly before the performance.
One tiny mistake leads to a break in the neck and...
She's my eldest daughter.
The kid is my youngest.
My son is on the top.
And the one below is my son-in-law.
Son-in-law?
What can I do to help you?
"From now on, just answer yes or no."
"No explanations, no short answers, no multiple choices."
"Hasn't been that long since this circus opened, right?"
Early this month it...
Answer yes or no.
No.
"It hasn't been long, I see."
So about 4 weeks?
"Well, not that long."
Yes or no!
No.
- About 3 weeks?
- No.
- 2 weeks?
- No.
Just walk out from us?
He did all my homework.
Sit down.
So you did it?
I see you missed out on your education.
"""We walk""."
Walk doesn't take an 's' in the plural.
"Page 24, ""The blazing sun ripens the wheat."""
"Let me explain, Sir."
I'd like to explain to you.
What's the subject?
Wheat is the subject in this sentence!
Wheat is the subject and the subject is wheat!
So Napoleon said: 'Let my white panache be your rallying point'?
!
"Well, I did get my leaving certificate."
Stay right where you are.
Here?
There!
Open your books.
It's time for dictation.
- What are you doing?
- It's in my book!
Go and sit down.
Get back to your desk!
What's wrong with your book?
Don't panic!
Get back into class!
Time's almost up!
You can go home now.
You stay here.
I'd like a word with you.
Put me down!
Put me down!
I can't go!
I've got to stay!
Put me down!
Stop!
Stop this sled!
Whoa!
What's the matter?
- You untie these straps.
"- Oh, no, no."
You might fall off.
I'm doing this for your own good.
Later on you'll thank me.
"I hate you, you beast!"
Let me out of here!
"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me!"
Whoops!
Ha!
- Let's go!
Mush!
- Mush.!
Beans.
"It's customary up here, Mrs. Blake, for everybody to pitch in and do their share."
"You've been with us two days, and you haven't done anything but sit around and look nasty."
Can you cook?
"Yes, I'm considered a very excellent cook."
Huh.
"Well, how about giving these beans the benefit of your talents?"
I'll do nothing to help you.
"I'm your prisoner, and since you seem to want me with you, you'll take care of me."
Want you?
I might know more than you.
That's why I'm not afraid.
Hold up.
I've met other people who talk like you.
They don't have anyone in their lives to care about.
Are you one of those people?
I think your diagnosis has gone too far now.
Being called out nosy is actually quite harsh.
I didn't mean it like that.
Okay.
It's a doctor's duty to never turn a patient away.
So I got to continue treating you.
Sorry for wasting your time.
"You still have the medicine, right?"
Here.
"Next time if you want to change doctors, you can."
Just inform them at the counter.
Never felt lonely.
"Because I have me, myself to care."
"Damn, so music video of you."
Up yours.
What's wrong?
Are you sick?
No.
You sure?
You want to see a doctor?
Damn.
To say sorry
I have to wait another month.
Yoon.
Yoon.
Yoon.
- There's that one.
- Is that a pentagram on the wall?
"Hmm, it kind of depends what you mean by pentagram."
I think he means this five-sided witchy-shaped thing here.
"Oh yeah, it is a pentagram."
I think we'll take a pass.
OK.
This building's on fire!
I'm 25% sure that fire has been put out.
Next.
[ sigh ] Oh!
"Well, what about this one?"
This one looks kind of perfect.
Yeah!
It does.
Can we see it?
Can we see it now?
Well...
I'll just get...
another one.
- Please.
"- Eat, eat."
Maybe we should wait outside.
"What if the police come by, and"
- I'm not there to be arrested?
"- Face it, Babs,"
They're not coming.
"Now, let's go play some lawn darts!"
But this is so unfair!
Why won't the police arrest me?
They're just not that onto you.
"- What's worse, I spent all that money on that bomb-making stuff."
Would you rather I'd lied?
Maybe.
"Well, I'm sorry."
I didn't think you'd want to sleep in the same bed...
"Oh, believe me... we are not sleeping in this bed."
Yaah!
Ugh!
So where are we gonna sleep?
Don't know.
Maybe I should just go home.
No.
You are home.
And we're not spending our first night back together apart.
"Look, I'm hating this as much as you are..."
Uh-huh.
...but we've got to move forward.
What's done is done.
You slept with morning.
I slept with rob.
And Matt.
We're still counting that?
"Oh, it counts."
You were with two people.
I was only with one.
"True, but I slept with two people only once."
"You were with one person twice, so, in effect..."
apples to apples...
I think we're even.
And I think your maths only works if you're fucking the apples.
"Look, I'm just trying to help us get through this."
How?
How can I get through this?
is he putting any food on the table?
We've got to help each other.
"We got to be really, really careful while we do it."
"I don't want to hear a word about her anymore, Henry."
Never.
-Daddy!
We missed you.
-Are you here to stay?
Did you see our pictures?
I did the one with the house and rainbow.
I did the sun.
My chorus concert is in two weeks.
Are you coming?
Do you like the house?
"-Karen, get packed."
We're moving out of here.
-With what?
Don't worry with what.
"Just start looking for a new house, ok."
I got to go to Pittsburgh in the morning.
"Those guys up there owe me $15,000."
We'll be alright. I got things lined up.
Pittsburgh?
You have to go see your parole officer tomorrow.
"Karen, don't worry about it."
Everything's gonna be fine.
Who wants to go to Uncle Paulie's?
What do you want?
"Sweetheart, let Mommy eat."
You look good.
Did you eat this good in the joint?
I don't want any more of that shit.
Shut up!
Help!
...
Saw your bro's name card and I saw a deal.
The person who killed your bro has a tattoo.
It's a scorpion.
Take it.
Thought you've principles?
Why pay me?
For your medical bills.
Thanks Mr. Lin.
I'd waited for you whole night.
Our fight is not over.
You still want to fight?
I'm not in the mood.
Then I win.
Since I defeated you
I'll help with your bro's case.
I'm the best cop around.
Even when suspended?
"Suspended, not resigned."
I've the highest record for cases solved.
Widest network of informers.
I know.
Using money.
Can you not shoot me down?
I'll find the killer very soon.
How soon?
I give you 3 weeks.
I don't need 3 weeks.
"Once done, you go back home quickly."
To your place of origin.
-Bail reports.
-Thanks.
Bull.
Right on time.
And in perfect order.
Billie. look how neat that is.
Yeah.
I didn't drool on it or anything.
Look.
Bull.
I'm sorry about what happened in the cafeteria.
It doesn't bother me that you laughed at my rhyme scheme.
You laughed at me.
Oh. come on.
Bull. that isn't you.
You never missed the boat of life.
Besides. there is no boat of life.
It's called a metaphor.
Harry.
A literary device used to illustrate dissatisfaction with my current status in the cosmos.
-Come again?
-My life is poo-poo.
Bull. we all feel like that from time to time. right?
I mean. everyone wants more out of life.
It seems to me like you've got it already.
You're a judge.
You stand for justice.
You're a public defender.
You stand for the underprivileged.
I'm a bailiff.
I stand.
Kind of like cattle.
"–Oh, sure I can."
"The truth is, the people we save from the worst day of their lives... never gotta see us when we have to face ours."
"Hell, and why should they?"
"We took the job, not them."
"–No, that's not right."
"–What you gonna do, man?"
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
–Fleetwood's got a warehouse full of stolen merch.
–No.
I say we nail him.
Sell half the stash to my new C.I.
–We get you some new digs.
"–I can't let you do that, all right?"
"Hey, I'm just..."
I'm just trying to do some good.
"You know, and deliver some karmic justice."
"Now are you in, or are you out?"
Easy.
Don't suck on his tailpipe.
One second.
–Yeah.
–It's me.
–Where are you?
–Home.
"–What, our home?"
–Yeah.
The keys still work.
–Are the kids with you?
–Yeah.
We're all here.
"Oh, thank you."
–This doesn't change things.
And then you tripled them.
"Well, yeah, I guess I was overdoing it a bit."
I wanna do something fun.
I'm gonna take Quinn out of school tomorrow.
Douglas Park.
We ain't been there in years.
Uh...
"Yeah, about tomorrow..."
Um...
My man died.
Leonard died.
- This past Monday we lost him.
- What are you talking about?
You were in transit.
I had no way of contacting you.
"- When I left, he was in the hospital."
- I know.
Leonard died?
His funeral is tomorrow.
I thought he was gonna make it.
Come on.
"Yeah, I don't feel right."
I can't.
"You're getting out of this car, and you're gonna pay your respects to his family."
- I can't.
I'm gonna stay here.
- He was your commanding officer.
He was our country's hero.
He was like a son to me.
You owe it to all of us.
You got five minutes to get your act together and get out of this car.
"You hear me, sergeant?"
Okay.
Forget I said it.
"-Say, Josiah."
-Yep.
Have you ever thought about marriage?
"Well, animals mate."
"Plants grow, flowers bloom."
Seems to be the natural order of things.
Maybe that's it. lt ought to be natural.
Right?
It's not something that's forced on you.
JOSlAH:
Exactly.
Then again...
... couldbethefates sending you a blessing.
BUCK:
Yeah?
Fine wife.
The life of a child.
Most men would live and die for that.
Yeah.
"Well, tell me this."
How do I know that Lucy is the one for me?
"I mean, I hardly know her."
Seems to me that would be a good starting point. lf you want it.
"Well, what do you mean?"
Get to know the girl.
Circled back two miles.
Looks like they gave up on us.
Probably fixing to break camp and get the hell out of here.
"If they're smart, that's what they'll do."
He ain't getting away this time.
- Shut up?
How long you been waiting to say that to me?
You two.
I need an explanation that doesn't involve my dad coming back from the dead.
_
_
_
What is that?
What language is that?
What are you saying?
!
Don't even bother.
It's some twin thing.
"It freaks me out, too."
[Stammering] That's what freaks you out?
!
"Hey, get your panties out of a twist, take a deep breath, and admit you know who I am, kiddo!"
- Don't call me that!
- Don't call me that!
"Now, you hate being called kiddo 'cause you're a grown man."
You took care of the family when I wasn't around.
"That's right, isn't it, kiddo?"
It's a mind-bender.
I know.
Imagine how I felt.
No.
No.
- Don't backslide.
Stay with it.
"- No, no, no, no!"
I know this is a lot to take in.
No.
- Clark.
"Uh, yeah, I know, I know."
This...
This is my home.
It is!
Rough day?
Y-yeah.
Were you -- were you saving this?
"No, no."
It's fine.
"But you don't usually drink, Clark."
What's wrong?
"Martha, you know how much I love you, don't you?"
Of course.
But with this job...
I can't always be as...
honest as I would like.
"Well, I know that."
"Thing is, you don't know."
"You don't know, so stop saying that you know."
Okay.
"It's okay that you have moods, Clark."
I'm not afraid of the different sides of you.
I love all of you.
"The world is an ugly place, Martha."
"And it is full of brutish, cruel, nasty people."
I heard something on the recording from Gaad's office.
Is he in more trouble?
He's probably gonna lose his pension -- maybe even go to jail.
- You shouldn't feel sorry for him.
"- Well, how can I not?"
- Martha.
Off to meet girls.
I've got a 30-foot range.
"- (girl) Is that you, Shawn?"
- Get out.
Fine.
No girls for me.
"I'll just study and get good grades and get smart and become a famous scientist, and then I'll build a wife."
I'm bored.
- (♪ jazz)
- What's that?
Mom?
Dad?
Are you home?
"- Cory, we're studying."
- So am I.
"Don't go, Rebecca."
Sorry.
I really don't feel like being here anymore.
You haven't seen the whole house.
Let me take you up to the roof.
"Actually, Eric, I think it's nice we didn't go any further than we did."
- Thank you.
- No prob.
Why don't we just study together like we planned?
- I need to study alone.
- So I'll see you Friday?
No.
"OK, then!"
"So, what's new?"
- I'm gonna kill you.
- I have you.
"I'm gonna kill you, I'm gonna bring you back to life, and I'm gonna kill you again."
What a catastrophe...
Didn't you find her?
Yes.
Amelia.
The husband tried to throw us down the stairs!
She was completely fat!
They say us singers end up fat.
I'm sure you won't.
Laura says hi.
How is she?
-Fine.
She's still my guardian angel.
Always worried about me.
She asked me how were you doing.
And what was your answer?
That you look so great!
And what do you think?
I think you have a normal look.
"A moment ago, I was thinking how would you look without beard."
Taxi!
Luisa!
Make him come to the concert!
"Hey Max, if you don't come, let's not wait another 10 years huh?"
"Do you like singing, right?"
Yes.
It's what a like the most.
And do you like that song you sang before?
I know that poem is yours.
It'd be better to say it was.
I wrote it more than 20 years ago.
How were you like back then?
Without beard.
But I'm so close.
Okay.
Do I need the thing to get out?
"Oh, great, you're here."
Let's go down.
Look at this.
"Wow, that's amazing."
Were you able to talk to Patrick about the maintenance?
"Yeah, we spoke this morning."
"Well, it really is amazing."
It just looks so real.
Like this wrapper.
It looks like a real hamburger wrapper.
"- Oh, that wrapper is real."
- What?
Yeah.
I always throw in a few real things.
Kind of cast a glow over the plaster objects.
"You know, kind of bump it all up a notch."
Did you do this at the MoMA show?
"Were there real things in that show, or-"
"Oh, yeah."
Course.
This is mine.
You got it from the staff kitchen.
"No, I made that."
This stuff is really good for your skin.
It has like all these minerals in it.
- Let me see!
- Let mejust finish!
- It doesn't match at all.
- It will.
There should be a cross passage about three yards from there.
"Tac Team leader, bring that *** down by agent Mei."
Guys...
It's Sara's.
We got a heat source.
"Wherever the reading's coming from, it's not on the blueprints."
Let's go.
"All right, we got something."
It's about five meters down the access shaft.
Hold your 20.
Lin's team will be on the flip side of the shaft in three minutes.
This is Alpha to Staging Command.
Can't read you.
We're going in.
There's our heat source.
That looks like a piece of her dress.
She was here.
Check it out.
Cover!
"Alpha, this is Staging Command."
Do you read me?
Do you read me?
!
"Kelton, answer me, damn it!"
Monroe!
Where's Kelton?
I couldn't get to him.
There was too much debris.
We can't get through.
Roof collapse.
"I repeat, we cannot get through."
"All right, call in Search and Rescue now."
Do you feel older?
Yes.
So when is your tour starting?
"You know, we actually just had to push it another month."
Our tour manager totally screwed it up.
She got the dates wrong.
"Actually, Cece, who I think you've met."
Oh.
The blonde.
"Yeah, the blonde."
"At the park, and at the show."
Right.
"You... you had a thing with her, right?"
No.
"No, no."
She works with me.
"She's my tour manager, and not into guys."
But what makes you think that I was into her?
The fact that I'm now officially an idiot.
His lesbian tour manager?
Oh.
What's this?
It's a birthday present.
It'll bring you luck.
And I thought you could use a little bit.
Thank you.
It's beautiful.
You're welcome.
"You're not mad at me, are you?"
No.
"No, it's actually just the opposite."
And that's the problem.
His traces only exist in the past.
Like a ghost hunt.
Ghosts have a soul.
He does not.
"From a technical point of view, A mind is a soul."
"This is not funny, Bishop."
I've seen them kill.
Suicide would be the best option.
"If you're afraid,..."
I get it.
Just put me in the right direction and I go alone.
We must find Cage.
That's not my style.
Not like a hiding place.
Cage is a man!
An old and nasty fighter.
With many weapons.
"He lives four days walking, Inside the death zone."
No human is so crazy.
"I did not say, that is not crazy."
Come.
I know the way
"Hello, guests."
My name is Sara.
"Sorry, my husband is not there."
Will come back later
We wait.
"Cookies, that's milk."
"I can see that, Sara."
Where do you get them?
"I made them, of course."
They try my husband better than his mother's cookies.
"Everything is fine, Franz."
The bar clown next door wants you to sing for him  for his ridiculous event.
Toni wants me to sing?
You can sing?
Can she sing?
I just want to let you know that I've cancelled it.
But why?
I could just sing for him once.
I would gladly do it.
I don't want her to sing for Toni.
Toni is a slave driver.
"You said it yourself, Franz."
They work all night long.
She's not working for Toni.
"If you have to, you can sing for him once."
Sing him the Internationale.
He'd enjoy that.
What?
The international workers anthem!
There were workers here once.
Screw it.
"I'm sorry, Franz."
I'm singing.
I'm singing!
I don't want to go to Toni's.
I won't go in there.
I've never been in there and I never will.
Once again....
You've sold the doors and the door frames?
Why?
I mean what could you get for a door plus the frame.
"Excuse me, but I have no idea."
Okay.
Where you going?
Away.
With a man I met from est.
"What do you mean, ""away""?"
Away.
I don't know.
For a few days.
"We've, um..."
[Sighs]
Had this emotional connection for some time... and we just want to see if there is something else there.
You're telling me you're going to have an affair?
- Sandra?
- I might.
I don't know.
At least I'm being honest.
Go ahead.
Tell me that you're not having an affair.
I'm...
You know what kills me about the whole thing?
Is that you didn't have any idea anything was going on.
"You, Mr. Counterintelligence Genius."
You just didn't see it?
So you either didn't want to know or... you didn't care enough to pay attention.
Who is he?
- It doesn't matter.
- Who is he?
It doesn't matter who he is.
What are you gonna do?
Go arrest him?
[Laughs]
Sandra.
Later I find out it's not.
I've been conned.
- What are my options?
"- Just drop it, right?"
- I'd say so too.
- Aren't there any legal measures?
- I'll look into it.
- I'll treat you to dinner.
Oysters?
- Oysters are just fine.
Call me.
- This weekend.
Mia's got a bag.
- Mia hasn't got a bag of oysters.
- I didn't buy them.
- You get them in a basket.
- You don't catch them in a basket.
"No, but you sell oysters in a basket and clams in a net."
You're confusing them with shrimp.
Way to go!
- Good morning.
"- My, fresh rolls and everything."
- Thanks for a great night.
"- Well, thank you."
You were great.
"It was mind-blowing, Frank."
"- Yes, I performed my magic."
- I've never felt anything like it.
"When you told me flat out, I was hurt, I have to admit."
- But Casper knew this little trick.
- You talked to Casper about it?
Yes.
"18 year old girl, like a rose."
"Boy at 18, nothing to boast;"
"Woman at 40, beauty most,"
"Man at 40, what a ghost."
"Woman at 80, sparkles and glows!"
"Man at 80, coffin soon to close."
What's your rank?
"Supermac 99, and yours?"
Supermac 98!
You've been found out.
You're done!
What shall I do?
"Only the Commissioner's fiancee, who can save you."
But I don't want to see her again.
This is an order.
Go immediately!
Why are you here?
You remember what you said to me yesterday?
I don't remember.
But I do. I remember it too well.
You said you'll never see me again.
I was just joking.
I don't mean what I say.
"But you said you love me, do you mean it?"
Of course I do.
I need you help.
My help?
To go after some girl?
Can't you even get Dumplings on your own?
All I want is to get the 'Beast'.
But Hiroshima has escaped and identified me.
I was told that only you can help me out.
Mrs Andrews?
Hi.
Probably don't remember me.
I live next door to Bob.
My name's Gil Raymond.
"Just thought I'd pop by, see how you were."
Gil?
"Oh, Gil."
You picked up my spoon.
Excuse me?
In the garden.
You picked up my spoon.
Erm....
"Oh, so I did."
"Oh, God, listen, what a day that was."
She never wanted me there in that house in the first place.
"Oh, I'm sure that's not true."
You don't know her.
She's a nasty piece of work.
The way she used to treat me sometimes.
And the things she used to say.
And he was no better.
Wouldn't lift a finger for me unless he had to.
And then....
Then he started mucking about with prostitutes.
"He was a pervert and... she was a mean, spiteful bitch."
And I tell you now... they deserved each other.
"Oh, well, my gosh."
How about I pour you another cup of tea because....
What do you think?
This one looks like it's getting a bit...cold.
Darling.
I have to get him.
I have to get him.
- No!
Let me go!
I have to get him!
I'll drag him down to hell with me!
I'll drag him down to hell with drums and trumpets!
"The world can go to the dogs, every single man and woman!"
We're all going to hell with drums and trumpets!
You can't go out there!
We're all going to hell!
You're coming to the station.
You're Biberkopf!
We're all going to hell!
Don't ever come back here again!
REWARD!
MURDER IN FREIENWALDE
"Listen, wanna make some money?"
A pile of dough.
- How?
See what it says?
"""Blond hair."""
Still don't get it?
Sure.
But won't that get you in trouble?
Nah.
You just say you saw them together in the car.
Near my place around 9:00.
"No, make it 11:00."
COURT OF JUSTICE
Fifteen years' prison for Reinhold.
Pretty stiff.
We'll check the lists.
Come here.
What are you waiting for?
I have to check your behind.
Turn over!
I don't think I can.
Wiggle a bit.
"Where are you from, son?"
Urfa.
"Wow, Urfa."
Not a traitor but a taker.
What do you do for living?
"I am a Zenne, sir."
Would a real man shake his hips for living?
"I always wanted to dance, sir."
"Good, then."
We can always use a go-go dancer.
"I am gay, sir."
"We can't hear you here, speak up!"
I am homosexual.
How can we be sure of that?
I brought you pictures.
"Here, take these."
What's this look?
What does your dad have to say about this faggotry?
"Sir, my father was a commander like you."
He died in combat in south-eastern Turkey.
"Not sure, what he'd say now..."
Give me the envelope.
So?
"Sorry, wrong envelope."
We'll show you how it works.
* What I know of it has me up a tree *
* Love is crazy
* After full of it what's come over me *
* We both said goodbye and parted *
* We agreed that it was there *
* Now I've got to make up all of it *
* Why haven't I confessed?
* I'm in love
* All over [banging on the drum]
* Tell me what did you do You're better than you * [whispering] What do you mean by bringing those people here?
Take off that uniform and get out.
You're fired!
You're fired.
He beat you to it.
Shh.
Get those people out of here.
[mark tree jingling]
"Oh, I beg your pardon, sir."
Young man..
I'm looking for the Patio Bar.
- Good idea.
"- Yes, indeed."
"- Hi, Doug."
- Hi.
"Let me see, just-just where are we now?"
"Hello, pop."
I thought you were going to Patio Bar.
"Well, bless me, so did I."
- What place is this?
"- Well, sir.."
You're now in the locker rooms of one of the largest enterprises in the world.
Complete with...
It's just that I've got to find my brother.
What gang does he belong to?
- He doesn't belong to any gang.
- [boys snicker]
I never heard of a Guy that never belonged to a gang.
I'm sure something's happened.
I've got to find him.
"If anybody could find him, we could."
"I mean, we know this town inside out."
"Oh, would you?"
"Hey, yeah, sure."
"Listen, you done us a big favor, now we'll do it for you."
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
"Hey, come on, let's go."
That Tony sure made himself scarce.
- We better walk you home.
- Where do you live?
I...
I was supposed to stay at a hotel.
But I don't know which one.
You could stay in our hideout.
- [boys] yeah!
- Thank you.
We'll look for Tony tomorrow.
If we aren't busy beating up goons.
- Yeah.
"- Hey, it's yo-yo."
- Get down.
"- Come on, hide."
- Did he see us?
- I don't know.
JESSIE:
"Oh, God!"
You kids do watch too many movies.
Come on in!
I don't have my suit on.
"So, Mick, do you like girls better than frogs yet?"
I don't like frogs.
Nice evasive move.
- What?
- Nothing!
"Mikey, you're staring at me."
"No, I'm not."
"Hey, it's okay to look."
"It may not be polite to stare, but looking's nothing be embarrassed at."
Just promise me one thing.
"When the girls you look at, they start to look back, make sure you're real nice to them; okay?"
"If I had a girlfriend, I'd do anything for her."
I bet you would.
MAN:
"Oh, my God!"
What the heck are you watching?
Just a horror film.
"Sorry, Buddy."
I don't feel good about you watching that kind of stuff.
"Besides, it's bedtime."
So what kind of fun stuff did you do today?
- Dad?
- Yeah.
How do you know you love a girl?
I don't know.
You just know.
It makes you feel good all over.
We're doing this my way.
"Ah, yeah, 'cause it's your way or the highway."
"Oh, God."
Not the highway.
You always want me to be his dad.
"Well, I'm being his dad."
"Oh, uh, I-I'm really scared, Jay."
This is what we're fixing.
"Look, when I was a kid,"
"I lived by a big, scary black lake."
I always thought there monsters in there and whatnot.
"One night, my dad dragged me out of bed and tossed me right in that cold water."
I was never scared of that lake again.
"Now, give it some gas."
- Mama!
- Aah!
"That's another habit I wouldn't mind breaking, but, you know, right now we... have to..."
"Oh, what am I doing?"
I hated my dad for that.
"I ended up scared of him, not the lake."
"Manny, it's okay."
Over there!
On the bike!
The white guy that stole my phone!
I don't see anyone.
Yes!
He just turned the corner!
The phone burglar!
He's getting away!
Not this time.
Up there to the left!
I don't see anyone!
I told you he was guilty.
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?
"Oh, Slink, I hope he's okay."
"Oh, a survivor."
Where's the rebel base?
Talk!
I can see your will is strong.
"Well, we have ways of making you talk."
Where are your rebel friends now?
"Sid, your Pop Tarts are ready!"
All right!
Are you all right?
"I'm proud of you, Sheriff."
A lesser man would've talked under such torture.
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Still no word from Star Command.
We're not that far from the space port.
The door.
It's open!
We're free!
"Woody, we don't know what's out there!"
I'll tell you wha...
"They're gonna eat us, Buzz!"
Do something quick!
Shield your eyes.
It's not working.
I recharged it before I left.
It should be good for...
You idiot!
You're a toy!
Use your karate chop action!
-Get away!
We're not the same breed.
Definitely not.
"I kind of like you, though..."
I know.
Me too.
I feel like getting closer to you.
Too bad I'm in a hurry.
I coulïve invited you to lunch.
You little bastard!
Isn't it nice here?
When no one bugs us we're content with simple pleasures.
"Just like flies, always buzzing around our balls."
Like we're indispensable.
Everything falls apart without us.
Don't go so fast!
My balls hurt!
Then stand up!
I win the prize!
Stupid ass...
Damn!
What a dumb way to get caught...
He's still thirsty.
Don't go away!
Give little Jesus a drink.
Here.
Take it and give him a drink.
Why?
I don't want your money.
Come on...
Don't give us a hard time...
Your tits really turn me on.
I'm meeting my husband.
"You're a loyal citizen of Germany, and I can respect that."
Sometimes I just don't know when to stop doing my job.
Thank you.
I wanted to ask...
How are they?
Ollie and Billy.
Oliver was killed last year in action.
- I'm sorry.
- And Billy...
William now...
He's missing in the Pacific.
I hope he will come back to you soon.
"I'm sure your father wants the same thing, Klaus, and I wish I could give it to him."
"But that's not the game, is it?"
"No, it isn't."
Thank you.
For your kindness.
It's the least I could do.
Maybe we can talk again.
Maybe.
- Soldiers are safe for now.
- That's great.
The Germans searched the Abbey last night.
They didn't find them.
We shouldn't leave them there too long.
We're gonna need a new camp.
Somewhere we can bring them longer term.
- Yeah.
- Varges is close to here.
Varges?
"Yeah, we talked about it."
Might be a good place to recruit more locals for the POWs to train.
"I want you... to stop what you're doing, and leave this village quietly."
I mean it.
Leave.
Quietly.
This is Gokseong.
My turf.
Don't mess around and get yourself killed.
Just leave.
"If you don't leave, you'll die."
"If you heard me, say something."
Or at least nod your fucking head!
Please answer.
"So, you're..."
"Shut up, bitch!"
You're blowing me off?
"Oh, I'm just not worth answering."
Is that it?
"You're not even gonna listen, right?"
Ain't that right?
"I'm trying to speak to you, but you're not listening!"
What's this?
What the fuck is this?
What the hell is all this?
What the...
What the fuck are these rituals you're doing?
!
What the fuck are you doing in my town!
Do you know whose daughter you're messing with?
Son of a bitch!
Look out!
Jong-gu?
Now what?
So you and Finn don't have to keep living in sin.
Whatever.
"- You hear that, Finn?"
- What?
You're off the hook.
"Oh, he's just daydreaming about two paintings a day instead of one."
"Well, I don't know."
Just give a guy a second here.
I need to think.
"(WHIRRING, CLICKING)"
"Ah, I never get tired of that sound."
"(BULB POPS, WHIRRS)"
Finn.
"All right, come on, guys."
It's not like I want to do this.
"Okay, then let's not do it!"
"Uh, do I need to remind you about the roasted dead guy in our basement?"
"We got to do what's in the photo, right, bro?"
How the hell did this happen?
I don't know.
Maybe it's a fucking dare.
- Maybe we're drunk.
- Maybe it was an accident.
It's a fucking lip lock.
We didn't just bump into each other.
"Say something, Finn."
We should destroy that machine.
What?
We can't do that.
I know.
It's too late.
It doesn't matter why we do this.
"""Redress,"" that's the sort of word."
And a lot of other words.
- Men have been here for years.
- Why don't they leave?
Leave?
Get caught and flogged like him?
- I won't join a mutiny.
- It's not a mutiny.
- And you're gonna prove it.
- You're taking the oath.
What are they doing there?
- What's this gathering?
- Just making rope.
With these louts lying on it?
Move!
Let's move it!
Don't quit!
Get moving!
Watch out or next time you'll get it.
I'm sorry.
It's my fault.
- Yours?
"- I pulled on the rope, tripped him."
"Don't have any more accidents, Vizard."
Or I'll have a look at your backbone.
Boatswain?
What's the matter?
Are you crazy?
"Vizard, I will join."
Good lad.
You'll be flogged for this.
Sergeant!
One breakfast like this could end all the day worries.
What an easy remedy.
As simple as making it everyday.
You'll have to come and make it.
I'll do it for a reasonable price.
Where will you say you stayed the night?
What is the matter?
Will you lie?
Nobody will ask me.
Where did you meet mom?
At college.
And had you met other girls before?
Yes.
Specially one.
What was her name?
Why do you care?
"Come on, tell me."
If you tell me about your writings.
That's blackmail.
Then I'm not telling you her name.
Her name was Amelia.
Was she pretty?
No.
"But she told me that she liked me, and that she was feeling good with me."
Are you and mom still arguing?
Much less now.
Poor Clara...
"Why do you say ""poor Clara""?"
-It's just a manner of speaking.
She says the same about you.
Is that right?
You're sad.
I just had to.
"Now, I know all about everything."
"You know if you're found, you'll be in a terrible jam."
- I don't care.
"- Oh, sweet...."
- What are you doing away from the school?
- I'm out.
Thompson fired me.
- He what?
- That's nothing.
That's part of it.
You should know all he's done.
- Tell me.
- We had a terrible row over the food.
That's why he fired me.
The boys can't eat it.
It's worse now than ever.
They won't stand for anything more.
All they need is a spark and they're capable of anything.
"Defendant, you're charged with the murder of Johnny Stone."
He knew Johnny was sick and he put him in the cooler.
"And you knew it too, didn't you?"
"You dirty, squealing rat."
Yeah.
"And you, Thompson, you killed Skinny."
"No, no."
"No, I didn't, boys."
I didn't.
I didn't know he was so sick.
I never would have done it.
- I ain't gonna let you throw yourself--
- Mind your business.
Anyway...
All the comforts.
- Can I have a look?
- Yes.
Do you know the area?
- Is the house yours?
- I wish.
We have fans available if you need them.
- Whose house is it?
- The owner lives in Valencia.
"She hasn't come in years, she's very old..."
- Who rented it last?
- I don't remember.
It's been closed for a long time.
It's the off season.
I was here yesterday and I saw three people enter the house.
"Nice, very pretty."
You're hurting me!
I asked you a question.
Who was here yesterday?
I don't know who rents it.
You rent it and you don't know to who?
I rent it to him by the day.
He calls me right before and puts the money in an account.
Lower your voice.
Who's the man in the hat?
Who is he?
I don't know anything.
I get paid not to meddle.
What are you doing?
What's going on here?
Nothing.
Understood?
"- Yeah, understood."
- Ok.
- This is ridiculous.
"- You, thank you very much for coming."
- Come anytime you want.
"- I will, I promise."
I promise.
Can I ride on the rig with you guys?
"Hey, chief, can the kid ride in the rig?"
"Sure, go ahead."
"Bobby, you ride with me."
Why do I got to ride in the suburban?
'Cause I said so.
"Come on, you big mutant."
I thought you were going over in that thing.
"No, I'm riding in the rig."
The chief said it's ok.
"Ok.Well, keep your hands to yourself, don't touch anything hot."
"If your kid's in trouble, I'm not looking out for him."
"He gets in trouble, mike's gonna watch after him."
"Oh, really?"
I guess he's in trouble already.
"Oh, whoa."
What the hell is this?
"Did you ok this, chief?"
It's ok.
Don't worry about it.
- I love you.
"- Love you, too."
"Hey, check out salt and pepper over there."
Wouldn't mind those two on a sandwich.
"Please, let me go!"
I can't stay here.
They told me to stick with him at all times!
Who?
The president of Yong Moon Plan...
I have to listen to him!
"Please, let me..."
You have to hide out somewhere that no one can find you!
"What bastard, in his right mind, stays home after stabbing a man?"
This is his house.
Stay here until things quiet down.
You...
- You can't call my mom.
- I don't even know her number.
I only stabbed him once...
Only once.
Do you think he died?
"What do I do now, Han Gyul?"
"Hey, how long will he be here?"
Suck it up...
You little...
Your phone.
You better never record me again.
Your voice recorder.
I gave that to the police at the station...
"Oh, is this it?"
The three million won you owe me?
Yes.
"Since you paid me back, aren't we done talking?"
Representative...
I'm a little scared.
Of what?
Freddie's got a brother from Oxford.
They want another girl to make it a quartet.
He's a bit of all right too.
And we're going to the Empire.
- The Empire?
- Yes.
"Oh, it's ever so gay there, lvy and the show is grand."
It's just where all the toffs go.
"- No, I don't think so, Marcia."
- Why not?
I just don't feel like it.
That's all.
"You ain't afraid to go, are you?"
Afraid?
- Why should I be afraid?
"- Oh, I don't know."
I just thought...
"Well, I ain't afraid of nobody."
"But you ain't been out for ever so long, have you?"
"- No, but..."
"- He ain't your lord and master, is he?"
I should say he ain't.
Or is it because you ain't got a nice enough dress?
Of course I have.
"What are you standing there for, then?"
Go and put it on.
All right.
What's that across your back?
What?
There's nothing.
Did he do that to you?
- Let me see.
- Would you use it?
Of course.
If necessary.
Jo asked me to say good night to Daddy for him.
He loves you very much.
I love him.
"But, darling, you don't show it."
You never tell him.
You never hold him.
Don't be afraid now that he's growing up.
Afraid of what?
What the hell have I got to be afraid of?
"I'm going to go for walks with him, aren't I?"
And swim with him and play football with him.
- David...
"- I want him to be proud of me, don't I?"
"To grow up like his father, a legless fucking joke."
I suppose you and your mother had a lovely time discussing me.
She's very concerned about you.
I don't need anyone's concern.
I can manage alone.
I can't.
"David, I need you."
- I love you.
- Don't.
"Please, don't."
I want to sleep.
"For God's sake, let me sleep."
Thank you.
You haven't let this room to anybody since the death of Mrs Garden?
"No, sir."
Not since Billy Parkin lived here.
Where's your dad...?
...He wasn't... my dad...
What this stuff?
I like puzzles.
I'm wanna go home now...
I wanna go.
Are you gonna let me...?
What are you gonna do to me...?
...I told you we couldn't be friends...
Hi...
Are you Larry...?
can I talk to you for a minute...?
Sure.
Sorry to bother you.
..How's... she doing...?
It's been... quite a night
They had to give her almost six pints of blood...
We're still waiting to see if her body rejects it.
I won't keep you too long.
I just want...
I need to ask you about the description you gave.
Of the little girl.
"You said she had long blonde hair was around twelve years old, and wasn't wearing shoes..."
- Right?
- Right!
Have you ever seen this man?
He's a suspect in a murder investigation.
Maybe...
Looks like a guy in our building
Did he have a daughter?
Like the girl you described?
I don't know.
What are you gonna do?
Let me think!
I gotta think.
Who else has a cell phone?
Um...turn 'em off and slide 'em over to me.
"- Ray, it's in my coat."
- Go ahead.
"- What happens now, Ray?"
- I'm thinking.
"There's no time, Ray."
Charlie doesn't have that kind of time.
Okay...
I want you to call the FBI.
You know which one of these is yours?
The little flip phone.
This one?
What should I tell them?
"The FBI, Ray."
What should I tell them?
"Um...tell 'em I'm armed, and I'm gonna have to start shooting people if my demands aren't met."
"Oh, God."
We're gonna die.
We're gonna die.
Just shut up!
I'm only gonna shoot you if they don't do what I'm asking them.
- Ray?
- What?
What demands?
What are you asking them to do?
"Tell 'em I wanna talk to the person in charge of their, um... you know, whatever they call it, their--their extraterrestrial project."
You want Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones?
"Cynthia, you're not helping."
"- So, what happens to her?"
- I was just gonna ask that.
- She probably dies.
"- Now, that's cool."
"- No, that's depressing."
"- Oh, I give up."
Excuse me.
- (quietly):
What's going on?
"- Christy, I can't do this."
You should just take her home with you.
No.
I already have a daughter I screwed up.
This one's yours.
But it's so awkward.
I have nothing in common with her.
So what?
"She needs a home, she doesn't need a buddy."
"I know, but I really want her to like me."
Then you shouldn't have signed up to be a mom.
"Hey, how about, how about you and Bonnie come live here and help me with her?"
We might have to take you up on that.
Let's see how the banana bread goes.
"Oh, great."
Now I don't know what you're talking about.
"Christy, this was a mistake."
"When people don't like me at first, they never like me."
I don't have a chance with her.
That's not true.
I didn't like you at first.
You didn't?
Nope.
Which one?
The one with the red lid.
It's just soy sauce.
Bring it over.
"What, are you deaf?"
"Out of the way, come on."
Stand back.
What is that?
I'll be fucked...
It's a real wicked spirit we've got here.
"You don't want to leave, do you?"
Let's go!
Stop it!
Hyo-jin!
"Come here, you!"
You met up with something recently you weren't supposed to?
I don't follow you.
Did you disturb someone?
"Of all the evil I've seen, this is the strongest."
You disturbed it.
"Oh, God!"
What do we do now?
Who is it?
Who did you disturb?
Tell him.
A Japanese man...
I knew it.
That's no man.
That's a ghost.
All the things happening around here are his doing.
"If nothing is done, it's not just your daughter, but everything that walks on two feet will perish."
Sir!
"- Boys, boys."
"Boys, stop."
It's the truth.
I swear Patsy's telling you the truth.
"I'm willing to take my chances, see this thing through."
We're in the same boat.
I'm not leaving here until they come and take me.
"If there's quitting to be done, you're gonna do it."
Don't be chumps.
Don't let them pin anymore on you.
We've got a rap to beat.
The way to start beating it is by putting out that fire.
"Now, what do you say?"
Do we do it?
"Jim, Butch, Mac, do we do it?"
"Casey, what do you say?"
"- Okay, come on."
- Come on.
Come on--
"- So that's it, eh, Charlie?"
"- Yes, sir."
"All right, boys, you can go."
There's no doubt that this tragedy was Thompson's own fault.
"- You agree, coroner?"
- The sheriff and I both agree.
"Mr. Gargan, I owe you a sincere apology."
"Oh, forget it."
"Hey, wait a minute."
They can't do nothing to him.
The guy's gonna be okay.
"Besides, he pulled a gun on Patsy."
- Shut up.
"I don't know, kid."
I'm too old for you.
I'm 31.
How old are you?
Almost 17.
"Means when I'm 21, you'll be almost 36."
That ain't so bad.
"- Edgar, I have to pee."
- God!
"How are you back there, Tillie?"
"- Hey, I'm pulling."
You talk.
- It hurts too much.
You talk.
It's hard for me.
I haven't had a lot of practice at it.
"When I was a kid up in Michigan, we'd go hunting."
For three days we'd not say ten words to each other.
Everybody just does what has to be done.
- Never told you about my first instructor.
- No.
His name's Sloaniger.
"God, he could talk."
"He'd yell at me, scare me to death."
"I was all thumbs for a while, the way you are."
"Dammit, he stuck with me."
"You know, he finally sent me off soloing."
I cried.
It's true.
"Before, I never felt I belonged anywhere and my parents didn't bother with me."
I kinda grew up all over the place.
That day I was up there by myself and I was just... weaving through clouds and...
"No, he wasn't there."
He really was a bus driver.
It looks like he got sick and quit about a week ago.
And what is he doing now?
I don't know.
"If he's sick, where could he have gone?"
You look sick too.
You should go home and get some rest.
I'll take you.
"I'm not going to go home, I'm going to see my mother."
"Well, I'll take you there."
Pull yourself together.
Let's go.
No one's here.
Woman Come in.
Where's my mother?
She just stepped out.
Is she going home?
"She did say that she'd be going home, yes."
This is a nice studio.
It has your mother's mark on it.
When did I last see her dance?
Hmm...
It must have been just as the Pacific War was starting.
That's right.
"When the war got worse, she stopped dancing in public."
She was dancing with Kayama-sensei.
Your mother's dancing was beautiful!
"You've danced with Kayama-san, too haven't you."
"Yes, many times."
He took me to many ballet performances.
"You can't forget Kayama-sensei, can you?"
Hey...
"I'll pay these guys back, I'll be back here"
"- in an hour, tops."
- Griffin...
"I'll come back here Sandy, we'll call Dad."
We will work this out as a family OK?
I promise you.
"Hey, it's Griff."
You know the drill.
"Hey, Griffin."
"It's me, your father."
I just want you to know that I love you.
And that we all make mistakes.
"You're responsible for your actions, I'm not saying you're not, but"
I want you to know that you're not alone; you have me and your sisters and even your mom.
I got you your job back.
I know it's not...
"It's not the best, but you know, maybe you're doing some good there and we're there for you, and... um, you can..."
"So just call me OK, just call me please."
"Would you do that, please?"
"And you're not alone, Griffin."
You're not alone.
- Long night?
- Yup.
- We should sleep.
Talk later.
- No.
Talk now.
OK.
Jerry kissed me.
It was a Hail Mary and it failed.
Total fail.
I'll come back.
Are you staying?
You haven't seen my colleagues?
No.
Madam.
You left the baby!
I went to fetch you some milk.
You haven't seen my colleagues?
No. I only saw them this morning.
This morning.
And this afternoon?
- Did they have the gear?
"- No, they had nothing."
I've prescribed her some pills.
Give them to her to ease the pain.
We don't have a car to get to the chemist's.
Give her medicine.
There's none left.
What's the matter?
It's her prescription.
Whose?
The invalid's.
The old woman?
I'll fetch it.
Can you drop me off?
"Yes, of course."
Good-bye.
Drive safely.
I'm like a general without an army.
Where do you want to go?
I'm going to the hospital.
Are you worried about your car or about the victim?
The dress says you have.
Oh no!
Oppa!
Welcome.
"Oppa, she said I gained weight."
Did I gain weight?
Does it look like I did?
"I don't know, I can't really tell."
What do you think?
Right.
It's nice.
Shouldn't you be a bit more excited?
Why are you so uninterested?
"He's just like that, don't worry about it."
Here.
The groom's suit!
"Yes, please come this way."
"Don't make any adjustments, I'll lose it by exercising more."
"I'll exercise and starve myself, so don't make any adjustments, okay?"
"If you can't breathe, you'll faint during the ceremony."
"It'll be healed by the wedding, right?"
"Yes, it'll be fine."
Wait.
I can't stand it.
It's old-fashioned.
She's my daughter.
Oh my!
She's beautiful!
I guess.
Ma'am...
She looks like an angel.
How could you have come up with such a phrase?
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
"Sifu Wong, I propose a toast to your health."
- You're too kind.
- Thank you.
"Cheers, everyone."
I'll help myself.
- It's an honor to know you.
- Don't mention it.
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.
It looks like I blew my chance to be Sifu Wong's student.
Let's get out of here.
We're like brothers.
We'll find a way.
I've got it!
What?
You have to continue with schemes to show your heroism.
I promise this scheme will work better.
I don't want to be a hero.
You've got to appeal to Sifu's compassion.
"Good, that's the look!"
Let's go!
"- Sifu, we're in trouble!"
- What is it?
"A band of robbers was raiding the bank and Mousy was brave, he stood up to them without thought for his own life."
He beat them.
- What happened next?
- It's bad.
He's severely injured.
Were there any police around?
They disappeared when the robbers arrived.
It was supposed to prevent!
I was supposed to protect them!
I should have expected this!
It was supposed to prevent!
-Enough.
It was supposed to prevent!
It's okay.
You're supposed to stop it!
It's okay.
Okay.
"You're supposed to stop it, Bobby!"
Look at me.
You're a good man.
You're a good man.
"Come on, we have to stand up."
"If Ray came to the road, they will have to hitchhike."
We have to catch him before than catching a ride.
Listen to me.
"When you come to a fork road, turn left ."
This will take you back to the place where you took the family.
I doubt that headed for the highway.
I will go in that direction.
Take this.
I have one in my car.
Bobbi.
-What is it?
Are you in trouble about all this?
I do not know.
I do not give a fuck.
"I'm dying, do you remember?"
What the fuck!
Ti.

Sonakshi I really liked that you attended the party.
Me too.
If you are planning to blow your brains out... ..could you wait till you're out on the high seas?
I just mopped these floors.
I don't need this shit.
you asked me to help you.
And God knows I've tried.
not really if you're not going to talk to me.
I hear you at night.
You're not sleeping.
You don't wanna talk about that.
Or the booze you're drinking.
Or the pus you're wiping away from your knuckles.
Or the blood I wash from your clothes.
Or the fresh wounds in your chest.
The ones that aren't healing.
And I'm pretty sure you don't wanna talk about the fact that you can't read the label on that bottle.
Ibuprofen.
That was my favorite mug.
Stay out of my shit.
Logan.
On the inside you're sick.
I can smell it.
{\i1\cH00ffff}Best night ever!
driver.
I love you.
I love you.
You're such a doll.
Mr. Logan.
Jesus.
Please.
We need a ride.
Not available.
Call a cab.
"- I mean, you got your ass kicked."
- Why wouldn't you tell me?
I could have taken a dive.
I wouldn't have had to get my ass kicked.
"Mac, it had to look real."
Were you gonna tell me eventually?
- Yes.
- Yeah?
- I was going to tell you eventually.
- Yeah?
You know what?
Stab this son of a bitch.
"Oh, wait a second."
"Oh, come on, Mac."
"Don't be like that, man."
You would have done the same thing.
"Come on, don't act like a baby."
Please don't stab me.
"Bash this ugly jerk's face in, Daddy."
- Your last chance to chicken out.
"- That ain't gonna happen, Bobby."
- I've been waiting for this for a long time.
"- All right, Frankie."
Seeing that we're a couple of old men here...
I think we should lay down some ground rules.
Now.
Number one.
Holy shit!
"Since I was currently homeless,"
Turk and Carla were letting me crash here as long as I needed.
"J.D., you have to get out."
"Now, what's he going to do?"
What's he going to do?
And...
Wait.
Don't tell me.
"Sound engineer Billy Logan, right?"
"Oh, my God."
What are you doing here?
"Oh, my God."
"Come in, come in, come in, come in!"
"Oh, I can't believe this."
Here.
You've been taking pictures of me.
"Yeah, I thought I saw you."
I hope you don't mind.
"There was nothing on the website, so, I took a few candids."
They're for the next issue.
"Cast and crew, after hours, behind the scenes."
"While I have you here, I have a couple of questions."
It's not your lucky day.
What a shame.
Just a kid.
At least he didn't hit anybody when he jumped.
Are we sure he jumped?
"""Tired of losing."" Not much of a note."
"Brevity, the soul of wit."
But he was a writer.
Look at all these letters.
No.
There's something weird about this.
"Monk, look around you."
That note's probably the least weird thing in the whole apartment.
"I mean, why am I lying to my husband about whether or not I put gas in the car?"
It was stupid.
And we each thought the truth would destroy the other person.
Funny how that happens.
But we all want to have sex with someone new.
"It's risky, it's exciting, and that's okay."
But divorce over that?
I would never leave my husband for a better orgasm.
"Thank you, honey."
Do we have to do it in here?
"There's a private office downstairs, I think."
Mmm.
"Oh, God."
Hold that thought.
Hang on.
_
Is everything okay?
"Let me get you another drink, okay?"
There's no need to rush.
We're here to take our time.
You want me to wait?
You know what happens to those that wait.
Good things.
They come.
"Oh, God."
"Oh, excuse me."
"Neil, there you are."
What's wrong?
Adriana's done a very bad thing.
I don't know if I can fix it.
What the hell?
"- Oh, no."
"Then, we can have... fun afterwards."
Let's do that.
"Enough, okay?"
"I'm really sorry, so let's stop."
I'm a bastard.
"No, I'm an asshole, okay?"
I didn't ask you to apologize to me.
Have I ever done this to you before?
You've done wrong today!
What's wrong with you?
Is that the restaurant you mentioned?
"Yes, it is."
Let's go in.
We'll eat and have a drink.
You must be hungry.
You should eat.
"Let's have a drink, okay?"
Let's go.
Let's have some sushi.
- Welcome.
- Hello.
"- We can sit over there, right?"
- Yes.
- There's three of you?
- Yes.
I thought about it as I was walking.
You're too opportunistic.
Why all the fuss?
You nearly brought tears to my eyes.
What about me that's so opportunistic?
"Frankly, it wasn't tears but disgust."
You were just trying to show me that you're a man.
Sent it already.
Turn off the computer.
Turn off the computer.
Turn off the computer.
Turn off the computer.
Turn off the computer.
Damn it.
You shook her hand once.
Now you're all messed up inside.
That's the bravest you've been in 7 years.
The last time you were in bed before 9 was 7th grade.
Lord
Buddha
Lord
Buddha
Lord
Lord
Hold on.
"I have another deadline on Wednesday, right?"
Damn it. 7 hours gone with the wind.
I should have fixed the nail.
Shit!
I'm lying down but can't sleep.
Her nail is still broken.
Forget it.
No one will see it.
"But if you can see it, someone else might too!"
How could you send such crappy work like that?
Shit her nail is broken.
"If you try too hard to sleep, you can't sleep."
"If you want to fall asleep, don't try so hard."
But her nail is broken.
At least I got the one.
Right?
Yeah.
"Get out, get out, get out."
We got a lot of work to do.
"Good, good."
- Ah!
- Mm-hmm.
What are we doing?
"Charlie, you're, like, the toughest guy we know."
- Yeah?
"- So nobody can kick your ass, right?"
- Practically invincible.
- Yeah.
"Yeah, what's your point though?"
Well...
"So here's what's gonna happen, pal."
Dennis and I are gonna train you... to be an underground street fighter.
What?
That is brilliant.
"- Yeah, it is."
"- Okay, what's the first step?"
- First step is getting that shirt off.
"- Yeah, let's get that shirt off."
- Why would I do that?
- That shirt's just gonna weigh you down.
"Yeah, and Rocky never wears a shirt when he trains... so let's just go ahead and rip that bad boy off."
I think I'm gonna wear it.
That's ridiculous.
"You can't train and wear a shirt, dude."
Now it's becoming this whole big thing.
It feels a little gay.
Nothing!
Nothing!
"I tell you I saw them, as clear as I see you now."
The captain's gone completely crazy.
He should be locked up.
He's becoming dangerous.
Everyone seems to know about it.
News travels fast around here.
People are staying indoors.
- There's no way they can know.
- We've said too much.
There's that sailor who saw the girls in the ship cemetery.
"What about Louise, did she see anything?"
Louise?
"Yes, maybe."
She has second sight.
Tragedy is upon the village.
Tonight he will be free!
Who do you mean?
The one who hides in the ruins.
I can see him!
He is waiting
He is calling.
I can see you!
"Open this door, so the devil's fury may be unleashed on this cursed land."
Let the death of us all be the price of your life.
Unleash all the forces of evil upon us!
I will give you the power.
Go on.
That's it!
Now open the door.
Good.
Pardon me.
What are we going to do about this Chummy individual?
We can't allow her to sing.
"The minute she opens her mouth, the ushers will open the doors."
"That's where you're wrong, Chowsky she'll be the biggest laugh in the show."
- But she takes it seriously.
- The audience won't.
Tell her her number's in.
[sighs]
Go on.
"Alright, dearie, let's try it."
Start from the first.
[piano music]
* Never felt so humbler to me
* So completely awed I couldn't speak *
* Never knew a heart could beat this way *
* When we meet this way

And it's self conscious.
Conscious of self.
Right.
"I mean, yeah, yeah."
I'm self conscious.
"Which is a good thing, I think."
What do you think?
"Well, I mean, I think it's really good."
I'm all about my work.
And my body is my work.
"So... one might say that... yeah, I'm all about my body."
"But in some respects, that is true, but you're completely missing the point."
And the point is...
I completely missed my point.
"Ok, rewind, reset."
"Uh, look."
I've... got a great vibe between you and me.
Great energy there.
"So, yeah."
Ok.
I get it.
So let's lay the facts down.
"You want to be with me, and vice versa."
That much is clear.
But my work always comes first.
I need to lay that...
down right off the bat.
"Basically, my body comes before you."
He seems perfect.
"Good looking, somewhat single minded, somewhat vain... and not too bright."
No promise of a great romance.
No chance of falling...
I gotta go.
Now...
Where were we?
Myka did name the ferret.
She's just not telling Pete the name.
- Why not?
- Because she named it Pete.
"Yeah, it's cute, but so annoying."
- That's good.
I like that.
"- You think that's funny, huh?"
"Because if she thinks we know, she'll kill him."
Name's Pete.
"Look, you're in trouble and I'm here to help."
"That chip that you have, the one that's changed your luck..."
- Let go or I'll scream.
"- Jillian, it's hurting you."
"Okay, that is a contact wound."
Wishing objects do that.
"This one seems to be a bit addictive and we both know that that's bad, right?"
"So you keep the money, but you give me the chip."
"Gary's sick too, isn't he?"
"You gotta stop while you're ahead, Jillian."
Trust me.
Don't make me use this.
"The Jubilee Grand, right?"
The fire?
What are you gonna do with it?
I am gonna put this on a shelf and ignore it forever.
I know.
Now watch.
Watch what?
Say the rest.
I need to hear it.
I love francis more.
What's this?
Open it.
It's blank.
it's nothing.
She let me decide.
"It's odd, isn't it?"
That your mother was the one
To show me what was truly in my heart.
You.
It's you.
It's always been you.
Does this mean you'll marry me?
Yes.
We must protect sebastian.
There are those who will punish him
For reaching for the throne.
Of course.
I'll make sure of it.
I am sorry for the way things have gone.
But the outcome is this.
You need to leave here
And never come back.
"You've reached for the crown,"
And you failed to get it.
You'll be seen by many as a threat.
"The crown was never in my grasp,"
"But I had mary, and it galls you."
I was going to disappear in exile.
"That's your goal now, if you want to survive."
"- Yea, I mind."
Actually...
Do what you like.
It doesn't matter anyway.
I'll take it out to the stairs.
"Oh Violet, you might wanna wipe your prints off those pieces."
Put them back on the fellas.
"Sounds good, Daze."
Come on sit down!
I wanna show you something.
You know you'd probably a millionaire if you clean your ears out more often.
No uh!
Here.
Now what were you going to tell me?
"Yea, the secret."
You were going to tell me.
Can I ask you somethin'?
Why is she so mad at you?
"- She's your friend, you tell me."
- I'm not talking about Violet!
- She blames me for something.
- For what?
- Her mother's death.
"- Why, did you kill her?"
"No, no."
She died after she left me.
- Why did she leave you?
- She didn't love me.
- Why didn't she love you?
"- I don't know, Daisy."
I don't think people have a lot of control over that sort of thing.
"As a husband, I wasn't much a prize anyway."
Yes.
I tracked you down.
I bumped into you in front of your apartment in Paris.
"Pretended it was just, uh, by chance."
We had a really good time in St. Tropez.
You stole my life.
"Look, if it's any consolation, it really wasn't much of a life."
You didn't seem very happy.
Oh.
Blame yourself.
"I mean, I tried to cut you in, but you wouldn't give me your pass code, so I mean, I had to use the drug."
How did I get away from you?
I guess I'm getting old.
Sloppy.
I forgot how physical you could be.
You ran off to tell Jacob.
(speaking German)
Please.
"Oh yeah, I'd be afraid too."
Why are you helping him?
Call it instinct.
You couldn't take that away from me.
"Uh, do you wanna see the girl or not?"
This way.
Stay.
What happened?
"It's under control, thank you."
"Julia, I'm Marta."
I'm a friend of your father's.
Where is he?
He's waiting for you.
Where?
I'd rather make sure the kids are tucked in.
They might have a nightmare and throw the covers off they could get a sore throat.
Wait.
"Give them something, Bruno."
Here...
Is all I have.
"Your wallet, Bruno!"
You punk.
Dirty little bastard!
Whas with this chick?
Just spreads her legs and stares at the ceiling...
Son of a bitch!
What are you complaining about?
"You got off, didn't you?"
Like screwing a piece of meat.
Get up now.
He needs to rest.
Look at this dumb chick!
No panties!
Hurry up.
I'd like to go now...
Don't you like panties?
You going to answer me or not?
Look what your friend did to me.
You should take it easy.
What if I can't get it up again?
"Look, you bitch!"
You're going to be all right...
Is not my fault!
I didn't shoot you!
I don't give a shit about his car.
He your boyfriend?
I don't know why you let him move in.
He's me brother.
You never know when you'll need bone marrow.
"He's rude, he's ignorant, he's lazy."
Yeah.
How could two brothers be so different?
"Anyway, he's gone."
Moved back in with Donna.
"That's the last we'll see of ""The Troyminator""."
"I had to tell you, at that party the other night in the bathroom, I saw..."
- What?
- What?
You was in the bathroom at the party the other night and you saw...
Saw... that it needed a makeover.
So paint it magnolia.
Put some decking' down.
Sort your taps out.
- Eh?
- Just a fuckin' thought!
Gotta go.
See ya.
What's up with you?
Looks like death row in here.
"Er... yeah, well, better get back in the saddle."
That horse'll be on bricks by now.
I'd best bust a move.
I've got to meet Amanda.
- Who?
- Amanda.
"You know, with weird eyes."
See ya!
"Gonna pop out, get some fags."
I should go.
Hang on.
"You might as well stay for the beginning of ""Saved by the Bell"", if you want."
"Okay, how do I look?"
Good.
How do I look?
"- Just be as normal as you can, okay?"
"- Wait, how much did I weigh at birth?"
I don't know.
It was your birth.
"But you should know, shouldn't you?"
"I mean, if you're my dad."
"Listen, she doesn't suspect that we're not father and son."
She's not going to be trying to catch us out.
When's your birthday?
Quick.
- August 19.
- Okay.
Who's my mum?
Your mum's your mum.
"So you were married to my mum, but now you've split up?"
Yeah.
Whatever.
Does it bother you or me?
"No, I'm comfortable with it."
But I think you still have a few issues.
"It's not funny, okay."
- Only cause you're a...
"- You love her still, don't you?"
- Christ's sake.
- I know you do.
- You love Mummy.
What was wrong with the last one?
Nothing.
And the people who bought it quite liked it too.
Really?
Really.
"Oh, for God's sake."
"Yeah, it's down again."
I called Ike.
"You call, I come running!"
"Ooh, OK."
Up and running again.
"Let me guess, he turned it off and turned it back on again."
"(LAUGHS) No, he replaced the router."
Apparently it was shot.
He swears it wasn't an excuse to come and see you.
Uh-huh.
Although I do think it got him here a lot quicker.
Would it be alright if I use the space?
To paint?
Yeah.
Or to hide from Ike?
To paint.
Yeah.
You go for your life.
Maybe I'll put one of yours on the wall and see how you like that.
Maybe.
"You know that Ike is a really lovely guy, don't you?"
And he really has a thing for you which means he's not going away anytime soon.
That's his problem.
Yep.
"But you'll still have to deal with it, right?"
"It's great out here, eh?"
This is Park Chun-bae.
He owns this house.
"He killed his wife, too?"
It appears so.
What's that bastard's name?
Park Chun-bae.
Then what?
"What do you mean, what?"
Gotta get rid of it.
"Either banish it, or kill it."
I'm casting a deadly hex tomorrow at the hour of the dog.
"Yes, sir."
You got the money?
How much?
"About 10 grand, don't you think?"
I'll have it ready.
Good.
Listen.
What I'm doing tomorrow- it's no ordinary ritual.
I'll be casting a death hex.
It's incredibly dangerous.
So you can't do anything that would taint it.
No intercourse.
Watch what you eat and drink.
Or the spell will backfire.
"Yes, sir."
Okay then.
You can go.
Can I ask you something?
What?
That Japanese guy.
You said he's a ghost.
Your date's here.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- It's good seeing you again.
"- You, too."
You didn't tell me you have a kid.
Huh?
Did you tell her you were my kid?
I am.
"What, did you have her when you were five?"
No!
"She's just, you know, a minor residing in my home."
"Hey, I know you."
"No, you don't."
"Yeah, I'm pretty sure."
"I don't know where from, but uh... why are you shaking your head?"
You know I
- I don't think we've met before.
"No, I'm pretty sure we're well-acquainted."
"You know, I think I would remember you."
You're pretty memorable.
Are you the babysitter?
Me?
"No, no I totally tried to fuck Ling before I found out she was seventeen."
"That doesn't sound right, taken out of context."
"Yeah, that doesn't sound right in any context."
-Let's go.
-Yeah.
"Nice meeting you Ling, Bender."
"Hey, how the fuck you know my name?"
Let's go!
The night is young!
Kind of a bad guy.
But you got better.
And I...
I always loved you anyway.
I'm glad you came back into Johnny's life.
Mom.
Can you believe this asshole?
He's still asleep.
I heard you talking to him.
"Yeah, well, we're an emotional lot, the Irish."
Giving up on him?
"No, just making my peace with him."
You should too.
"I mean, maybe he's just waiting around for you to tell him it's all right for him to go."
And I'm not saying that just 'cause I had him going today in the pool.
Although that would be a nice parting gift!
I don't know what to say.
You'll think of something.
Thanks.
"Okay, Dad, um, we love you."
You've been a good dad.
You've been an...
You've been an okay dad.
"On a scale of one to ten,"
I'd say you were a six...
You were a five.
Um...
"But look, last year, you really made a comeback."
"I mean, you were..."
You were almost an eight.
But I get it.
You saved people's lives for a living.
"Murat, what happened?"
Don't tell her anything.
She doesn't know...
What the hell happened?
"Don't panic, he is OK."
I fucking fell down.
Tell me the truth.
Was it that little bastard?
"No, I just fell."
God.
Don't embarrass him.
Go back to bed.
OK.
I really am OK.
"Just leave, I got to pee."
"Don't worry, he's all right."
He is not my boyfriend.
He is my shadow.
Where I walk... he walks with me.
He knows what I eat... where I sleep... whom I am with.
Why is he following you?
Because here in Istanbul I have a different life.
"Yo wimp, do you think I didn't spot you the other day, mamma's boy."
That's not fair.
How are you bro?
Are you OK?
Just want you to know that I took care of your money.
It's all settled.
Do you need anything further?
"Off course, he would come back... every time I enjoyed freedom."
Why would he do that?
You should have gone to the police.
But thank you very much.
Send your man up for the carriage as soon as you're ready.
Goodbye.
Don't thank us.
Your feet are cold.
What have you been doing?
You can grow potatoes in this dirt.
It's cold.
I'm cold.
Where can Brandon be?
I hope he's not lamed his horse.
Col. Brandon is the most eligible bachelor in the county.
He is bound to go for one of you.
He's a better age for Miss Dashwood.
But I dare say she's left her heart behind in Sussex.
"I see you, Miss Marianne!"
I think I've unearthed a secret.
You are worse than my best pointer.
Is he a butcher.
Baker.
Candlestick maker?
I'll winkle it out of you.
- She's good at winkling.
- We've none of us any secrets here.
Or if we do.
we do not keep them long.
- He's curate of the parish.
- Or perhaps a handsome lieutenant.
- Give us a clue.
Is he in uniform?
- He has no profession.
He's a gentleman?
- They're my roommates.
"- Cece, hi."
"I'm gonna go in and get the rest of your stuff, Jess."
"Wait, let's just talk about this, okay?"
"You know, rap it out."
We can't rap it out.
We're not together.
It's not the same.
- Doesn't mean we can't talk.
- Nothing to talk about.
Give me my shirt back.
"No, you gave this to me."
I wanna keep it.
"- Give her her T-shirt, man."
"- No, I don't want to."
And I gave her this hat.
I'm gonna take this back.
- This one?
You want that?
- Yeah.
"Then I dare you, come take it off my head, pal."
I dare you.
- You guys look ridiculous.
"- Look, give her the shirt back."
- I bet she worked hard on that jamboree.
"- Yeah, play on words."
- Jamboree.
Jam.
- Jam.
"Girl made a lot of jam, Spence."
You know how time-consuming that can be?
"You need ajar funnel, a canner, some fresh fruit strawberries, raspberries, maybe a tayberry, maybe a ripe..."
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
"Oh, this is the man who saved you."
He's the one.
I was in the right place at the right time.
I want to talk with yuko.
Come on.
Let me show you the place.
It's been a difficult week.
Yeah.
"Campanela, taka, thank you Shelly."
And now our connect at the Mexican boarder has been killed.
Do you know who did it?
I think maybe his wife killed him.
"No, shit."
These things happen.
I do know this guy in San Diego.
I do know this guy in San Diego.
"When I was in high school, I used to smuggle a little pot, you know."
Then I would cut him in on the action.
And he still works the boarder.
Sounds promising.
"And the best this is, he doesn't have a wife."
I like you Nick Davis.
I think fate brought you to me.
Well here's to fate.
And to family.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
I've offended you?
"No, I was just thinking about something."
Tell me.
Did you know Miles did the frosting on that?
You see that?
It took me five minutes to figure out it was a Fibonacci series...
Where the next number is 21.
"Now you're slipping, Cam."
"Cam, you owe another six bucks."
"No, no."
I didn't eat any of the Buffalo wings.
"Oh, really?"
That's great.
"Well, we're not doing it that way."
We're just dividing equally.
So let's say you pay.
"- I got it, all right?"
"- No, no."
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
It's your birthday.
You're as broke-ass as I am.
I just wish now I had eaten some of those wings.
"So, I nailed the specs on the 2.09 last night, after 19 cups of coffee."
- Check it out.
- You are kidding.
- What is this?
- You're kidding!
This is good.
"Miles, this is good."
"Yeah, well, it better be 'cause this is what we've been working for since we got here."
This is called destiny.
"You know, there is the..."
-Fill me in here.
What's...
"Okay, so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna go down there,"
"- have a 360 around, just doing a chair check... - ...before I get the hard hat on and suited up."
"Checking out to see if there's any foreign objects, debris that might come down on top of me."
"And then, once-once I've checked her out, top of the water level, um then I'll, come back up and get suited up."
-Okay.
Jump on.
-Fantastic.
Okay.
"-Cool, buddy."
Let's give it a go.
-Yeah.
"Okay, up."
Okay.
Lower down.
- Down slow.
"-That's good now, yeah."
Down four.
Slower four.
"What do you got there, Tony?"
Loose one?
"Yeah, I've got a loose rock here, mate."
"I want to take that out, um, before we go any further."
"It's...if that comes down, it's, it's bad news, man."
Got it.
That could make a good day go bad really fast.
"Okay, I'll take that hard hat back."
-Here you go.
"-Thanks, Mike."
"Take me down probably another two feet, Mike."
Roger.
- Don't do this to me.
Don't walk out when I need you the most.
Please don't do it again.
Like what you see ?
She's just the greatest kid.
I know it's a terrible parent cliché but she just makes me laugh like no one else I know.
She sounds great.
- You should meet her.
- I'd love to.
"So, what about you ?"
Nothing like that on the horizon ?
"Fatherhood, responsibility ?"
Me ?
"No, not a chance."
Slade said you're seeing someone.
"Yeah, I am."
Laura.
"She's great but you know, early days."
- Are you serious about her ?
- I'm crazy about her.
Is she about you ?
"Of course she is, look at me."
I'm a hell of a catch.
She's just... honestly she's just a bit scared to take it to the next level.
Anyway.
Tell me about...
Stuart.
We met in the States.
He worked in the building next to the hospital where I was working.
"So, I was seeing him all the time."
I've never thought I'd end up with someone in finance.
But he's just one of those people.
Of course.
"Believe me, I never kill anyone unless I have to."
Well?
- We need...
- The hospital is surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.
You have 30 seconds.
"After that, we're going to open fire."
Resistance is futile.
I repeat:
Come out with your hands up.
You don't have a chance.
Come out.
"Go, go."
I'll never do what that bastard demands.
Give me a hand grenade.
We might have a chance.
"- Tomás, have you got a smoke bomb?"
- Yes.
Throw it out the door when I give you a sign.
"José, you'll be all right."
They don't know that you're one of us.
- Tell them we took you hostage.
- Thanks for everything you've done.
- Goodbye.
"- Mariá, you can't have a gun battle here."
- Think of the children.
"- They will torture me, if they catch me."
"Tomás, now!"
Let's get out of here.
Fire!
What have you done?
What is that on your face?
It's mu gaze!
What age is it... that you flirt in such way?
- Hello...
- Stop your work!
- Hello!
- I have something for you!
I'm in a meeting.
The signal is not good.
- What meeting?
- Hello...
- The signal is low!
I'll hang up.
- Yawang.
Get in.
I'll drive you home.
Don't tell Mr. Lin that I go with Mr. Qu!
Not you!
Why do I have to get in your car?
"Just take it, or I'll stop the work!"
Don't you think the workers will be so pitiful?
Hi girl!
Do you want to have some coffee?
Let's go for dinner.
No!
My parents are waiting at home.
"Being home right after work, is so boring!"
"Since you are in hurry, we will go back faster!"
Are you insane?
Why are you speeding up?
Don't you like excitement?
Stop the car!
"Okay, what's going on Marta?"
Know what I think?
I think you set me up.
I think this amnesia is bullshit.
"No, no."
"Oh, fuck me."
What?
"You're gonna tell me, you don't know who this is?"
Who is it?
"It's Jared, damn you."
"Paolo and Yale are dead, Marta."
Why?
I don't know.
"Alright, I don't remember anything, I swear."
Is Jared a victim too or is he in on this?
"Yeah, um, I'm getting out of here."
What're you gonna do?
It's Kyra.
I told you to turn off your cell phone.
What have you gotten us into?
Why are you calling here?
Because I told her to.
You know she was packing to leave when we got here.
"Oh, I haven't spoken to you since Berlin, partner."
"What do you want, Jared?"
"Oh, come on."
You're a smart guy.
"You've spoken to Marta, you found my place."
You must have figured it out by now.
Numbers to the Swiss bank account.
There ya go.
This can't be agency sanctioned.
It's already there?
Let me ask you one thing.
What is your true form?
What do you think is my true form?
The devil.
You're the devil.
Why can't you answer?
You've already said it.
I'm the devil.
Shaman
I'm almost there.
Where are you?
Are you home?
I'm with the woman now.
You mustn't let her tempt you.
Never.
"Whatever she tells you, you must go to your daughter now."
Do you understand me?
Understand?
Do you?
Is that your shaman?
Don't believe what he tells you.
They're in on it together.
Isn't that right?
You're already certain I'm the devil.
That's why you came here... carrying that sickle.
"My words, whatever I say- they won't change your mind."
No.
That's not true.
There's no doubt.
You came here to confirm your suspicions about me.
That's not true!
She's smart.
I was a little protective of her when we first got here.
I just wasn't sure how she was gonna deal with your scene.
I think she's dealing just fine with my scene.
I think she likes it.
"Obviously, she's getting stoned with you..."
-...and she's reading Spin.
-I don't read Spin.
I've never read Spin.
She found her own way into the studio.
It had nothing to do with me.
Yeah.
"It's always like that with you, isn't it?"
They....
They always just happen to find their way in.
What's that supposed to mean?
"It means you're charmed, that's all."
Someone's looking out for you.
Nobody's looking out for you?
I'm sorry.
Come on.
Your life looks good from my perspective.
-I've worked for what I have.
-And I haven't?
-You are so stuck on the negative.
-I'm not.
"Yes, you are."
-You've blocked out all the fun we had.
-I haven't blocked it out.
It's all filed.
What about the trip to Veracruz?
Yeah.
"- I mean, it's not good for clothes."
- It's just cheese.
- It's wax.
"It's, like, balled up wax."
"- Oh, the wax."
- I love the happiness of that moment.
- Yeah.
- Look at Jonny's face.
- Yeah.
- John Cho.
- Holla back.
- I love that shirt.
"- I bought that from the wardrobe sale and gave it to Eddie, a.k.a. Jesus Christ."
"- Oh, really?"
You did?
- Yeah.
The hype man knows what you want but he's not sure if you want it enough.
Do you really want it?
Do you really want it?
This was funny.
"So you just randomly picked this extra to be, like, the guy who loves the band, right?"
I didn't even pick him.
"Our AD, Christo, picked him."
"He said, ""You okay with this guy being the fan of the band?"" I said, ""Yeah."""
- Then the backflip.
"- All of a sudden, he can do a backflip and no one knows it."
Right.
"And it was just something he just did, right on a whim?"
"He said, ""Can I dance?"
"Can I do whatever I want?"" I said yes."
- Look at this.
- And then he threw in the backflip.
- It's giving me a cough.
- It is not giving you a cough.
It's lovely.
"Come on, catch up!"
- Over there is a field of rabbits.
- I don't want to see rabbits.
- Is anything superior to this?
- I told you it would rain.
- Blue sky!
Let us chase it!
- I'm not supposed to run.
Are you hurt?
- I cannot walk.
Run and fetch help.
- I will run as fast as I can.
Margaret!
Don't be afraid.
He's quite safe.
- Are you hurt?
- Only my ankle.
May I have your permission to ascertain if there are any breaks?
It is not broken.
Can you put your arm about my neck?
Allow me to escort you home.
At last!
She fell down and he's carrying her!
"Marianne, are you hurt?"
It's a twisted ankle.
It's not serious.
I felt the bone.
And it's sound.
- I cannot begin to thank you.
Been trying to get those two together for a year.
"I did it, and now I'm like a dog off his leash."
"Okay, Dad."
"And let me tell you, I didn't waste any time."
I'm on the Tinder.
"Oh, okay, well, it sounds like you're good."
I'm banging my balls off!
"Medium rare, medium rare."
I want that burger medium rare.
Are you at the OTB?
"Yes, I am."
And you'll never believe what horse is running today...
Daddy's revenge.
How perfect is that?
"I got big money on this one, kid."
They're off!
"Go, go, you son of a bitch, run!"
"Spike him, spike him, you miserable little munchkin."
Hit him!
Hit him like you're wearing big boy pants!
That's it!
"Oh, faster, faster!"
"Santa needs you back at the village, yes!"
"Go, you son of a bitch, go!"
Yes!
Winner!
Revenge!
"Oh, ah, shit."
Dad?
"Oh, shit."
"Hey, Frank, it's me, Smolinski."
"Yeah, I don't know how comas work, but if you can hear me, screw you and wake up, you big shit."
- It was like a blow to me when he passed away.
"- Yeah, it was sudden."
It was
- It was terrible.
I never felt that way before.
He always used to say to me...
"""You know, Claire... if it won't be you, it'll never be anybody else."""
- What does that mean?
- He wanted me to marry him.
- Did he ask you?
- Sure.
- So why didn't you?
- So I said I wasn't ready to -
- I wasn't ready to get married.
- What are you waiting for?
I wasn't ready
- It is a lot of things you have to do when you get married.
Like what?
What did you have to do?
Inviting the people.
There's a lot of work involved.
Yeah.
Sure.
I would have helped you.
Max was a wonderful man.
"- He was never married, was he?"
- No.
- I know that.
- No.
- So you would have been his first wife -
- And again he said to me -
"He always said to me, ""Claire, if it won't be you... it'll never be anybody else."""
"She drank too much, that's all."
"Oh, yeah?"
What about Marseille?
When will you realize nothing's going on...
Too much garlic...
"Let's give her a few days and then, Shai, you go talk to her."
We stressed her out.
You mean I stressed her out?
- I didn't say that.
- Then why did you look at me?
Butt out.
Who asked you?
You're right.
"- Ricky, what are you doing?"
- Going to have some fun.
How did you know my size?
I asked Ricky.
You're tough on him.
"I didn't tell him to come, and you butt out."
Did he cheat on you?
- Did he hit you?
- Are you crazy?
Then what is it?
"You're just like Aunt Rosa, always hiding things."
"That's right, like the adoption thing."
You even hid it from Morn.
Why can't you share?
- None of your business.
- We can help.
How?
You want to be a surrogate mother?
You're such a hypocrite.
"Whatever you need, Mom."
Whatever you need.
Hey.
How was the pier?
"Okay, I'm not being funny, but there was literally one shop."
Are you serious?
"- I know, right?"
- Yeah.
There are more shops than that... in jail.
"Well, I'm sure you found a way to have fun."
Did Mom seem weird to you?
"Um, not more than usual, but she's fine."
Don't worry.
Well...
"I will be in my room, avoiding risky activities."
So... yeah.
Mom just went off on me and made it clear she doesn't want me to ride.
"- Well, did you talk to her about it?"
- Have you met Mom?
Good point.
Mm-hmm.
Anyway...
"How have you been, Dad?"
How's your time-out going?
It's been pretty quiet.
A little too quiet without you guys.
But tell me about that cute little island you're on.
Did Rosie meet the queen yet?
"The queen, she is in London."
And it's...
It's cool.
I met some new friends.
It took some time.
Will she be OK?
I don't know.
Her heart's gonna be weak for a while.
"Maybe forever,"
I don't know.
You know Dr. Jerry Gordon is the guy for you.
You do know that?
Thanks for your help.
- I couldn't get in.
- It happens.
And Dallas.
Exciting.
Big trauma centre...
Congrats.
That's great.
"You don't mean that, do you Jerry?"
Sure I do.
I'm thrilled you're gonna be thousands of miles away.
Doc?
- I didn't touch the guy.
"- No, that bruising around his neck just appeared like magic."
"What was it, a choke hold before you put him in the car, or after?"
"I wouldn't make accusations like that, Doc."
I'll do whatever I want.
He almost died.
Which would have been a real tragedy.
We still need to talk to Mr. Pike.
"He's going to be a little busy, what with the CT scans and the trip to ICU."
"Well, we'll just wait."
There it is.
Casa Natasha.
"And one and two and three, twist."
"A one, two, three."
"Onto the floor, class."
Down you go.
Onto your elbows.
Single leg lift.
Right leg first.
Left leg bent.
Here we go.
And up.
Down.
Up.
Two more.
Get ready to change.
Left leg.
Hold those tummies in.
Enid!
Single leg lift!
"Oh, sorry."
"So, Tubby."
Is he very sad?
What?
What did he look like when you saw him?
He looked like someone finishing off a pasty.
"For frig's sake, Enid, if there's any havoc caused, you've caused it."
Dithering and faffing about.
You never sort anything out!
"And everyone's favourite, the bicycle."
"Summer will come, let's get ready for those bikinis!"
# I am clear on the fear that has led up to where I am now

"I had to drive over to Sandy's, mix the stuff, then get back to the gravy."
"Do you think you can come over, fuck me, then leave?"
-Got someplace better to go?
-Don't talk like that.
Come on.
-You all right?
-Yeah.
You believe me?
Do you believe me?
-That's the last one?
-Yeah.
You lying son of a bitch!
I hate you!
Please stop feeding the dog from the table from the plate on top of it.
Stop it.
-l have to.
-You don't have to.
I gotta go home.
What do you mean you got to go home?
We gotta start taping it to your leg.
We got to go soon.
I gotta go home and get my hat.
Forget your fucking hat!
Are you kidding me?
I need a trip to Rockaway because you want your hat?
I got to have it. lt's my lucky hat.
I never fly without it.
Do you understand what we are involved in?
I don't care. I need my hat.
I won't fly without it.
What could I do if she insisted I drive her home for her Goddamn hat?
I hid the package in the kitchen and I went to take her home.
Where are you guys going?
Don't you want to play anymore?
Was it something I said?
Sheesh.
"I know you're not counting cards, because I spot cheaters for a living."
So how do you do it?
Ever hear of just being good?
I make it a daily practice.
- I practice being the best.
- At cards?
And other things.
"Well, you'll have to tell me about it, someplace I can hear you."
I have a room.
I have a suite.
You win.
Watch those.
She's in.
Nice pad for a cruise line employee.
I'm an independent contractor.
Better perks.
"Now, where were we?"
You move fast.
- Life's short.
- I have a feeling...
I'm not the first girl you've brought to your suite.
Why waste the night talking about other women?
I like you.
I like champagne.
I'm gonna go freshen up.
Be my guest.
I caught you...
Putting on lipstick.
Bye-bye.
"Doctor, this is an emergency."
This man has been shot.
Come on in.
Let's have a look at you.
Here you go.
Let's get some of these things off so we can take a look at it.
Easy...
There.
Now get up here on the table.
Alright.
Now turn a little bit.
Let me take a look at this.
When did this happen?
Just a little while ago on the street.
Hm-hmm.
You know I'm gonna have to report this to the police.
You know who did it?
"A sniper, I think."
"Hand me a shot, please."
"Sniper, huh?"
Is it serious?
"Well, if you mean are you gonna die?"
I don't think so.
"You know, one of the greatest dangers arising from a gunshot wound is infection, but... they have a cure for that now."
This just came out.
I've had some very dramatic results with it.
What's it called?
Penicillin.
There we are.
My forceps.
Does that hurt?
"It's not like this is my spot, this is Seo Yoon Jae's spot."
I'm sure that perfect Seo Yoon Jae will take care of it.
Eat slowly.
It's hot and spicy.
I can't eat this.
Are you going to die if you eat it?
Keep it down and be quiet!
Yoon Jae...
"The food must be spicy for you, so how about a nice refreshing beer?"
Huh?
Alcohol?
Why not?
"Sure, sure."
I'm not going to die if I drink it.
Father...
Yoon Jae has to drive.
Da Ran...
I don't have a car because it was in the accident.
Yoon Jae...
"You're not even well after the accident, so you shouldn't be drinking."
"I think if I have one drink, it'll help me fall asleep easily."
"-Please give it to me, father-in-law."
"-Dad, dad...!"
Me too.
Alcohol for an 18 year old minor?
No way!
A kid can't drink!
You can't...!
No one's going to deny that you're a teacher...
That's right.
"Since I'm a teacher, I can't watch a student drink alcohol."
You don't have to take me back...
Okay.
"He needs extra oxygen, he's gonna have to spend the night."
"Okay, that will be fine."
"Then, we'll hold off on the film for now, but if he gets any worse... ."
He gets x-rayed.
He says he didn't do it.
"D, I don't like this any better than you do, man."
He wouldn't lie.
"Come on, man."
Did he lie about the tagging?
Or the weed they found in his pocket?
"Look, K.J.'s a good kid, but right now, his judgment basically sucks."
I wanna talk to this Doctor... .
-Dubenko.
"-Yeah, the security guard too."
"D, they don't wanna press charges, man."
"But they're accusing my kid, I just wanna talk to them."
Banana bag is finished and she took a few ice chips.
Who are you?
I'm Dr. Lockhart.
You're at County General.
"Let's see if you can sit up on your own, okay?"
She should be sobering up by now.
"Glenda, can you squeeze my hand?"
Let's see.
Try and squeeze my hand.
Squeeze my hand.
Come on.
Okay.
Can you open your eyes?
"Glenda, come on."
Good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Surprised to see your pal Greg here.
Surprised to see your pal Greg here.
"He's undercutting us,"
"He's undercutting us, using our bloody network to sell his bloody gear."
using our bloody network to sell his bloody gear.
"Me, I'd set an example."
"Me, I'd set an example."
Prove to me you're not just another Kiwi wanker.
Prove to me you're not just another Kiwi wanker.
How you doing?
Fine.
How you doing?
Fine.
(SCOFFS) What's with you?
(SCOFFS) What's with you?
Greg.
Greg?
Greg.
Greg?
You know what he calls you - a poser.
You know what he calls you - a poser.
How can you be mates with him?
How can you be mates with him?
TERRY:
It's obvious you're not happy.
TERRY:
It's obvious you're not happy.
GREG:
"Mate, I'm as happy as a pig in shit."
GREG:
"If you get up now, you will finish it in time."
You can work here.
I brought your computer.
There's WiFi too.
This is why I told you not to call me a douchebag.
But this is about finishing work and being responsible.
Just a little bit more.
Only 2 photos.
"If you finish this job, you can rest as many days as you want."
"And when you're done, we'll go to NYC together."
Ok?
So what did you say to him?
I told him I want to sleep.
Damn.
Was Peng angry?
He wasn't.
Just told me to fuck off and change careers.
Don't worry.
I will find you some jobs.
Will you do one thing for me?
Don't do anything stupid like this again.
I'm asking you as your best friend.
Alright.
Je.
You have to have a baby.
What?
I came back from the dead just to see your kid's face.
So you are free today?
Yeah.
I came to take care of you.
I have so much to do.
Number 116.
I am a parrot of the sea.
A puffin that is no longer the sea.
Do not.
"-Bravo, Loving brought us a strange bird, and told us it was a penguin."
Bravo.
"Thanks, I deserved."
"Sorry people, I'm sorry."
But when I lost my hometown.
I was very lonely and very scared.
"Then I met you, and you believed in me."
Sven ...
It was so good have a family.
Thank you.
And that goes up to heaven.
"Folks, let's try this."
"Come on, everybody together."
Fuck you!
[screams] [groans in pain]
You know now?
"Dad, listen to me."
"Dad, give me a second, would you?"
Please!
I'm doing it all now because you're not focused.
My guys have Angel.
There's nothing to worry about there.
You got to focus.
You have to focus!
He cut my face.
What the fuck you want me to do?
"You're standing in front of a mirror, aren't ya?"
"You didn't have to come here, Dad."
I can take care of this.
Enjoying yourself?
Don't be stupid.
This is work.
So flirting with girls is part of your job?
Seeing you grinning makes me want to puke.
Are you getting jealous?
You must be joking.
"Well, cut it out."
"You'll eat, right?"
"Hey, aren't you going to take my order?"
Leave it to me.
"Fine, then."
Reminds me of when we met.
"Just like now, you were quietly eating the kimchi meatloaf I made."
Was I?
Yeah.
You ate it and told me it was like your mom's cooking.
"Oh, I remember."
"You cook so well, I'm sure your restaurant will do well."
So good luck.
But not Korean food.
What?
My restaurant... will serve soba and sake.
You can make soba?
It'll take time.
So you'll have to work extra hard.
Hena.
Are we... breaking up?
Don't talk about that.
"Yeah, this really is good."
Your meatloaf really is the best.
Want some?
"Legs, up to here!"
I'll think about it.
"Good, don't take so long!"
I've got to drink something.
Why are you coming here?
I walk around the whole day  and think about how I could live.
I come back here and wait...
"Mainly, I've been waiting on you, my dear."
You've really downsized quite a bit.
My father started all that.
I've told someone about you.
Could you imagine living here with us?
He'd like to take a look at the hotel.
Why?
He could do a lot more for you.
Why are you coming here?
You leave everything open.
"Very nice, without any obligations."
We have the ability to speak.
What is it that you do all day?
What do I do?
But you're still staying?
I'm still staying.
It's so silent here.
No singing.
Where is Emilia?
She's taking a walk.
What?
It's one in the morning.
I have no idea.
Perhaps she's singing outside now.
What do you do before you come here?
'
And I'm killing Rambo thanks to you.
You are welcome.
Hang on...so who's guarding the grain store now?
"Oh, yeah, no... no one."
"Oh, shit!"
Stop!
Stop!
Stop it!
Oi!
Oi!
"Well, well, well."
The Professor.
"What brings you out here, then?"
"Oh, just concluding..."
"you know, a big sale."
Pleasure doing business with you!
Uh-huh?
How much did they steal?
Not much.
"A bit, yeah."
"Quite a lot, actually."
"It's fine, though."
I can handle it.
Of course you can.
"If you'll excuse me, I've just bought darling little Rex."
I've got a busy day of stroking ahead of me.
"Out of interest, what would you do if you were me?"
"Some kind of nose job, I imagine."
About the burglary.
"That's easy - make a few cutbacks, fire some of the fat ones."
"And if you're very low on grain, you're gonna have to raise the price."
I don't have time to wait for a giant to fall asleep.
The powder Mulan gave us...
we need to use it.
We gotta knock him out.
"Well, that's riskier."
Than waiting for a giant to fall asleep when we need him to?
Point taken.
"Ooh, you're a tough lass."
You'd make a hell of a pirate.
Who's Milah on the tattoo?
Someone from long ago.
Where is she?
She's gone.
Gold.
Rumplestiltskin.
"He took more than your hand from you, didn't he?"
That's why you want to kill him.
"For someone who's never been in love, you're quite perceptive, aren't you?"
Maybe I was once.
I got doughnuts.
I got jelly.
(Chuckles)
What's wrong?
Nothing.
"No, no."
Hey.
What's wrong?
This was on the wall at the post office.
I didn't even know they did that still.
When did this happen?
I was a janitor in Phoenix... this high-end jewelry place.
The manager was a drunk.
We have a warrant to search the premises.
Thank you.
Hi.
Thank you for meeting me.
I didn't know I had a choice.
I want to take you somewhere.
"You know, you can't just take me out of class because you decided to just take a stab at being a mother today."
"You know, like, I could have tests and stuff."
Do you have a test today?
- No.
- Okay.
"Well, then, come on."
Come in!
Christ.
Did I order you?
No.
Mary did.
She hired me to help make sure that you stay clean.
Said you had somewhere to be later.
"I-I don't know if I'm hallucinating or dying, but either way, I like the view."
"Hello, Angel."
It's Annie.
And you look exactly like I thought you would.
Dashing.
Depraved.
"Okay, that's enough standing."
Come on.
"Now, sit."
Stay.
Drink this.
It's a protein shake.
I don't want it.
Your friend has a powerful enemy.
It's open season on her and I wanted to be the one to do it.
"VICKI, IT'S ME!"
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HEAR THIS!
IT'S WINTER!
SHE'S SOME KIND OF DEMON.
WATCH OUT!
You're too late to save your friend.
I'm over here!
Nope!
Here!
- What are you?
- What I am.
- You know.
- Demon.
"There are all kinds of us, with all kinds of hungers."
What are you doing slumming it down here?
Nothing is without purpose.
"You want me, right?"
Why'd you kill the kids?
"I hook them on the bottle, then move them up to the spike."
That's when I feed all their sweet juices.
I had to sacrifice a few to get your attention.
"If your kind get too much of the bug in them, my little ones go crazy and they feed, too."
"That's kind of a win-win, right?"
That tickled.
Darkness is waiting.
Let it wait.
"It'll take a lot more than that to beat me, bitch!"
Henry?
Sorry I'm late.
Sweet ride.
She here?
She's not with me anymore.
You miss her?
Very much.
The mantle's quite pronounced now.
You're almost home.
"Hey, Mom."
Why did you come here?
I needed to see you... in person.
"You didn't ask to see me before,"
- when you were with Musa.
"- I wanted to, but I was afraid."
Of your own mother?
"I thought you would reject me, send me away."
"And yet you ran away from the Hunt, from Abby and the others."
It was too much too fast.
"When I saw Jules, I couldn't handle it, but Musa was right."
I don't belong at the ETU.
"I'm tired of hating myself, of fighting what I really am."
You can help me.
"You didn't raise me as a Hunter, but you can now."
I want you to be my mom again.
Why should I believe you?
"I'm here, aren't I?"
Love does swing the hammer.
"I'm not gonna hurt you, Mom."
Then show me.
Come closer.
It's been ten years since we've seen each other.
The least you can do is give me a hug.
You think I'm gonna hurt you?
You would if Musa told you to.
Are you serious?
Seriously.
Seriously.
I'm glad you think it's funny. making money.
We want you to throw a fight.
I said no.
One thing led to another.
It ended up with me smashing the guy's head in. offered me a deal. they'd set me up with a new life somewhere.
this is somewhere all right.
I fight once in a while.
It stops me going out of my mind and gives me a bit of spare cash.
the Feds don't give you any money?
man.
the fucking assholes-- they literally give me just enough to survive.
That's why I took your deal.
sweetheart.
I'll be right back.
Well... it's good.
We are on.
And the money?
Open book.
Who knows?
000.
But there is one thing.
what's that?
You're fighting Victor.
Do you really have to do this?
Yeah.
I don't want any part of it.
Forget about that shit.
Focus on the job at hand.
Come on.
"Put it down, put it down."
- Let it go.
Put it down.
- I'm taking care of it.
I got it.
Put it down!
- What the hell are you doing?
- I can't work with this guy.
You can't work with me?
"Who do you think you are, lady?"
"I've been here for eight years, and you're just another untalented pretty face."
"- Billy, calm down."
- Untalented?
The ratings keep going up every night.
How do you explain that?
The ratings go up when the jackpot goes up!
"It has nothing to do with you, you moron!"
"Billy, I've warned you before about your attitude."
That's it.
You're out of here.
You're fired.
Somebody call security!
What?
"No, no, fired?"
"Wait, no, don't fire him."
"Look, see, I'm moving it."
I'm moving the cable.
Get him out of here.
"- Stan, don't do this."
"Please, not now?"
"- Come on, I'm sorry."
"- It's too late, Billy."
"Or did your father send you to detain us, while he flees to Russia?"
- Ha ha!
It was a joke!
Put that thing away!
Where is my father?
I could go take a look.
It's best if we all go together.
"No, we're all staying here!"
I've been preparing this evening for weeks.
"- I won't allow you to ruin my event, just because you've gone crazy."
- What do you want?
Just tell me exactly what it is!
What?
Yes!
What!
?
To go to Sweden.
To Sweden?
He wants to go to Sweden.
Why didn't you say that earlier?
Give Bulle a call.
He drives up there tonight.
He could pick him up.
"And get Angie, she can take over from here."
You will allow me to let someone take over.
I have to take care of my bar.
Tell me...
Couldn't we break off the pieces and move them?
We can't.
That's how the world champions would do it.
Fine then.
The knight goes from G5 to E6.
Where have I been?
I've been trying to get here!
"Look, we'll never be able to find her."
If...
"If I walk over there, she's gonna walk over here."
"If I'm on this side, she's probably gonna be on that side!"
"All right, panicking's not gonna help, Shane."
"Hey, want to dance, tough guy?"
"No, I'd step on your feet, I'd hurt you."
"Thank you, though."
"All right, now, everybody up, everybody up!"
This is Eden East!
This place is amazing!
I can't believe they kept this from us!
I knew you would love it.
This is why I brought you here.
Vitality!
"Oh, it is so nice to be out with lots of people!"
Everyone's smiling and laughing.
Don't you guys love this?
It's great.
"In a couple more minutes, I'll just roofie myself."
"I will go get my special Salvadore drink, yes?"
"Oh, yes."
"""Guess I am on my way."""
"""Mighty glad you stayed!"""
Yes!
Yes!
He is so much fun!
"Oh, God, don't even start."
I'm just having fun.
"No, it's just..."
Take a look over there.
They're having all this light come right through that.
Do you have to go now?
"Can you come back, or no?"
"- No, no, I'm going to go."
"- Okay, well, did you know why"
I came to see you today?
"Well, I'm making a film about Lou."
"- Well, I knew that."
- You knew that.
- I knew that.
- But...
I'm Lou's son.
God.
I saw you when you were six years old.
I saw you at the wake.
I saw you with your mother.
You remember that day?
What a crazy world.
You are Lou.
Have a nice concert.
- Where's Nathaniel?
- Why'd you get so upset?
"Gosh, you love a man..."
"and I knew Lou had a son, and I was told never to tell that Lou had a son."
I don't know.
"Lou was... didn't talk about his family much, except about his daughter."
He didn't talk about that.
Men don't talk about those things.
"That was his, that was his very personal thing."
We all have those personal things.
Thanks.
I think I'm in love already.
Gah!
That would have been a clean 50 from the both of you.
Excuse me.
Which one of you is Dr. William Blunt?
I am.
Is there a problem?
I'm afraid there is.
I need to talk to you about my father.
Arthur Waverly.
You might have noticed we're playing a round of golf here.
"You have a question, call my office."
I'm sure...
That's not how this is gonna work.
We're gonna talk about my father.
We're gonna do it right now.
"Hey, buddy."
This isn't the time.
Maybe you should tell your friends to take a walk.
"It's okay, guys."
Just give us a minute.
I'll see you at the clubhouse.
"Look, I don't know what you think that I could tell you, but..."
How sick is my father?
He has stage four.
It doesn't look good.
That's one.
One what?
I understand that you sent him to Argentina.
I'd like to know why.
I can't discuss private medical records.
That's two.
"I'm taking this, okay?"
Just for a while.
The poor thing.
We hit the deer and his paw.
What do you call it?
The paw.
-The hoof.
-Got caught in the grill.
I got to hack it off.
"Ma, it's a sin to leave it there."
I'll bring the knife back.
Delicious.
Why don't you get yourself a nice girl?
"I get a nice one almost every night, Ma."
But get yourself a girl so you could settle down.
I settle down almost every night.
But then in the morning I'm free.
I love you!
I want to be with you.
Why don't you settle down?
"How's your friend, Henry?"
What's the matter?
You don't talk too much.
Talk.
What are you quiet for?
"You don't eat much, you don't talk much."
-l'm just listening.
"-What's the matter, something wrong with you?"
"When we were kids, the compares used to visit each other."
There was this man.
He would never talk.
He'd just sit there all night.
I did not say anything.
"No, we are not allowed to say."
He said not to talk assignment.
Thi What did he say?
"No, no ..."
Nonsense!
I do not believe it.
- To think about how to get out of here ..
- Thi-thin mouth!
Damn.
He told me to ...
I can not do what I asked.
You must stop this.
"No, no, please!"
"- Room, microphone ..."
Move!
- Are you sick!
If you do not see us or hear us ...
This will end the game.
Do not trust anyone but yourself.
"Sitting or hit you, you fool!"
Duties ...
I can not do.
You know what to say to me?
To kill anyone when you ask me.
Do not you understand?
"Do not want to kill us, want to punish us"
Do you think it will be a loved membiarakan If you follow the rules?
- Are you an idiot Dave.
- Are you crazy?
We can not do anything with it.
We must do what we were told.
"Hey, mi amor!"
"When you're finished playing with the kids, come play with me."
Where is the car?
I got a guy tuning her up in Yonkers.
Going out to the track next weekend.
I'm ready for Le Mans.
You ready to come with me?
Take a chance?
- I can't leave the kid by himself.
"- Excuses, excuses."
You're just fooling around with that register.
"- I have to pay you back, right?"
- That's right.
Good morning!
"The light, Mag."
I'm trying to finish this.
"- Good morning to you, too."
"- Hey, hey, muñeca."
Buen día.
What is it with these space chicks and the hugest tetas I've ever seen in my life?
What happened to the eggs?
The eggs I asked you to bring home last night?
Those eggs?
- I guess they're at the bodega.
- I guess so.
Why don't we go out for breakfast?
We haven't done that in a month.
- I've got to work.
- I thought you were hungry.
"I am, but-- hey, why don't you get the eggs?"
I've got to pick up beads for the dress.
You can't do me a favor?
"Okay, I'm coming."
I'm...
Here I am.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I'm here.
And the reason I chose my mother as the hero of this college essay?
She faces her battles every day even though she may never win the war.
She's helped me see... that I didn't cause her disease.
I can't control it.
And I can't cure it.
This is my mom.
And that is her story.
And now...
I'm ready to leave home... and claim my own.

Allison.
- Sorry.
What?
- We have to get your mom something.
She doesn't care about stuff like that.
She's just dying to meet you.
They both are.
"In the Midwest, you don't go to a person's house, let alone your girlfriend's parents', without bringing something."
That's S.L.
Hello.
"Yes, I'm Babette."
So are we going?
Are we staying?
"No, we have to go."
"Fine, okay."
Good.
If you're looking for me.
I'll be here.
Bye.
Where did you pick up the little one?
Blonde angel.
She just appeared.
How come that doesn't happen to me?
You are too pretty.
Should I make myself ugly or what?
Disguise yourself.
Take a look at this.
You know what this looked like before?
No idea.
I do.
What do we do now?
Do you want me to retrieve the file?
"If you ask me, It was a Halloween prank by a couple of kids from the tattoo shop."
"From earth, the sun and the moon appear to be the same size."
Is it coincidental or physical necessity?
This is good.
"So tell me, what kind of quiz show is this?"
Sauerbruch...
Who would be interested in that?
I don't want to discuss it with you now.
"Now here I am, and here I'm gonna stay!"
So think it over.
What are you doing here?
"Franz, come home!"
Why that look?
What's wrong?
- It's not a woman's business.
Things will get better.
You think so?
"I've starved and frozen many a time, but things always turned out fine."
So you're Mieze.
I was Franz's girlfriend before.
I'm Cilly.
I don't know a thing about Franz.
"Oh, don't you look smart!"
- What do you want to know?
- Everything!
A guy with one arm ― out of the question!
Buy him a barrel organ or give him a couple marks.
We've got to watch out for him.
You know why.
What good's a guy with no arm?
- Or a guy with no brain!
- Huh?
You can't see he's come to his senses.
He just wants to spy on us!
Rubbish!
I know what he wants.
"I'll try him out, and I'll be responsible."
"Mieze, you've got to watch out for him."
They make him do anything they want.
"I'll get a job, if I have to be an organ grinder."
Who am I kidding?
I'm in no condition to do this.
I'm sorry.
"I'm in no condition to do this, mate."
I'm in no condition.
I'm sorry.
I'm in no condition to do this.
"Oh, goodness."
"Oh, goodness, what have you done?"
"What have you done this time, Jimmy?"
Are you still conscious?
Yeah.
Hello.
You're gonna be okay.
Just gotta get a little bit of power into you.
"Ladies, could you give us a bit of space, please?"
Thank you.
"You're a big deal, you know?"
You're not the only one wronged by Akan.
You and I both want the same thing.
This might hurt a bit.
There we go.
That's wonderful.
Now I can take you back to my lab.
"I'm Jimmy, by the way."
I realize this is all very confusing for you.
"Um, but... it's better if I show you at the lab..."
Hello?
"Oh, spasiba."
They're here.
They must've followed you.
I can't let them see me like this.
-I'm sorry sister.
-It's okay now.
Why are you soaked in rain?
Will you change your clothes!
They said Migs is not in their house.
I also called Ara but he isn't there either.
Where could he be?
I don't want to think he's with Bela.
You should've told me you were coming.
I could've prepared for your birthday.
What really happened to you?
And then you'll come here drenched in the rain.
I don't know.
I was disoriented.
"I can't remember, I didn't know where I live."
That's why I went to your house.
-It's good you didn't get lost--
"-Bela, I really wanted to be with you."
"Wait, wait!"
You have to go home.
-Joy might be looking for you.
-I don't give a damn about Joy.
What if he's not with Bela?
.
And he was picked on in the streets?
And something bad happened to him that I don't know.
"Sis, sister, just go to sleep."
Do you know that's what I wanted to hear from you when I came back from Canada?
But you chose Joy.
And you got married.
I know.
But I'm not happy with her.
"I'll bet you $50,000 i can put it up to 200."
"I'll take you... because if you do that, money won't mean anything."
There won't be any wall street.
"You've lost your reason, jim."
You're getting drunk- drunk with power.
"10,000 at 140."
I'll take it.
"25,000 at 140."
I'll take that.
I'm taking all the gold that's being offered.
"Now, name your price."
"50,000 at 140."
I'll take it.
"100,000 at 140."
I'll buy it!
A million at 140.
And i'll buy that!
"The trading is closed for the day, gentlemen."
"I've found him, josie."
"Well, josie, here i am."
What do you want?
"Nick, is it true- what jim told me?"
That i'm fighting him?
Yes.
"Look, josie, do you think i'd have walked out on him if i didn't have to?"
I'm trying to save him from himself.
He can't win.
"He'll not only be hated, he'll be ruined."
And you'll make millions.
Yes... and it'll all be his if he wants it.
"Josie, we've both got to help him because he's after something that no human being can have."
Are you sure?
Lengthen the crew's mission.
I promised them...
"No, probably not."
Don't worry.
Good-bye.
Isn't that ditch finished yet?
I've hit a rock.
Good luck.
"I can see, in fact. I can hear."
We've reached a dead-end too.
"You're lucky, you have a pickaxe."
We don't have one.
We can't do anything.
I can provide you with a pickaxe.
Our problem can't be solved by a pickaxe.
"If it could, things would be easier."
One blow of a pickaxe would do.
"Instead of a pickaxe, you can offer me some tea."
"Please, help yourself."
"If you give me your Juliet's address, I'll ask her to provide us with milk."
"In the village, knock on any door and they'll give you milk."
I didn't find any.
"Even at the sea, there's no water for me!"
Can't I ask her for some?
No problem.
She's at Kakrahman's.
Go to the village...
You'll find her there.
Kakrahman's house...
"Ask anyone, they'll know where it is."
Get in.
I'm not disturbing you?
This is where I was in foster care.
"Oh, sorry."
Me and two other dudes and a girl with messed-up fingers.
I'm so lucky I got out of here.
It's not luck.
"I mean, you got out of here because you're very talented and people love you and..."
Are you peeing?
Where's Donaghy?
I want to talk to him right now.
"Last time I saw him, he was riding the crane camera."
"Oh, I have Pete for you."
"Pete, oh, my God, I didn't know."
"No, hey, listen, it will give me a chance to spend more time with my kids."
I'm quitting.
I'm quitting right now.
"No, no, no, no, no."
You have the best job in New York.
Don't quit over this.
"Don't buy all the hot dogs, okay?"
I don't want to do this without you.
"Hey, I thought we cut the cat-lady sketch."
We're two minutes short!
[Cats meowing]
"[Scratchy voice] So, let me introduce myself."
My name is Lurlene Katz.
And these are my cats.
She's using a real cat?
I cast that cat myself.
"Why, they are my..."
Aah!
Ow!
[Peanut growls] Oh!
- What about you?
- That's okay.
- We'll just stay for one night.
- No vacancies on the weekend.
I think he's fooling us.
It wasn't so expensive before.
I agree.
It's a rip off.
The rooms seem pretty much empty.
- See?
No one's here.
- You're right.
He was trying to make you stay longer.
"We'll stay here the night, and I'll look for some place cheaper."
- Let's look for one after we eat.
- Sure.
There's a lighthouse.
The sandstorm is not so bad.
How fortunate.
"Oh yeah, I enjoyed the music."
- Wasn't it nice?
- Yeah.
- Did you really like it?
- Yes.
The melody is soothing.
Nothing exaggerated.
You sung how an average person would.
I liked that amateur feel to it.
I admire your good taste in music.
"Changwook, I admire you as well."
How?
It's hard for a married man to openly bring along his girlfriend like you.
Hey...
And you just left?
Yup.
So it's over?
I don't know.
She says that every time and then she goes back to him.
Well maybe I'm just being paranoid?
It was time for the bi-monthly...
breakup post modern.
Who said what...
did I handle it well etc.
Can I ask you something JP?
What baby?
Come back to bed.
How many girls are you sleeping with?
Baby why you so drama?
So what?
So drama.
"I mean why would he hang out with me for six months, and text and call... everyday?"
Last night I was trying to make this really good point.
We just had sex JP.
It's good.
I just had your penis inside of me.
But that sounded...
a lot better in my head.
Ouch...
- Sorry.
Last week bird crap this week balls in her face.
Ah it's typical.
Is it true he has a monster schlong?
I don't know where she gets her information.
But that's absolutely true.
"I was doing it in her sleep, but you woke her up."
I did wrap the blade in silk.
She's not hurting too much.
Come!
Do you want to finish the job?
Mary...
I love her.
And me.
- Do you love me?
"- Léo, yes!"
"Speaking of which, she told me again that I made love to her like nobody else."
Then she told me that it wasn't important.
"My father, my mother, you."
Love.
"The same feet, the same toes,"
the same footprints.
Footprints change with the sole of your shoes.
"The mud without marks, that's me."
You're cold.
You're warm.
You're hot.
You burn.
You kill.
Do you want to finish me?
Don't piss about!
"Take off your sneakers, so they think we aren't here."
I won't give her up to anybody.
No.
She belongs to me.
"If God made us, he would have made us different."
The rats have made off.
I'm offering you quiet on the Western front!
I don't know what the problem is.
"Okay, sweet, yes."
Best?
I don't think so.
It's 1 0 after 7. I have to go to work.
Just give me one good reason why we shouldn't.
"God, it's a hundred degrees in here, and I'm about to die."
You're trying to change the subject.
I can't breathe.
"Listen, you can be honest with me."
"No, I am being honest, I can't breathe."
Michael.
I'm not budging till you give me a good reason why we shouldn't.
-Because you've gone completely mad.
"-Come on, no muss, no fuss?"
No family... .
"Yeah, okay, they might be a little surprised."
"You think? "" Hi, Mom, hi, Dad, guess what I did today?"""
-They'd get over it.
"-No, actually, I don't think mine would."
"-Well, they'll have to, because I love you."
-Michael.
It's a great story for our grandchildren.
They'll think we're crazy.
-We would be crazy.
-Do you love me?
"Yes, I do."
"See, you already said, I do."
"That settles it, that settles it."
-We're getting hitched today.
"-Wait, wait, not so fast."
Will I have a bouquet?
Rough day?
Y-yeah.
Were you -- were you saving this?
"No, no."
It's fine.
"But you don't usually drink, Clark."
What's wrong?
"Martha, you know how much I love you, don't you?"
Of course.
But with this job...
I can't always be as...
honest as I would like.
"Well, I know that."
"Thing is, you don't know."
"You don't know, so stop saying that you know."
Okay.
"It's okay that you have moods, Clark."
I'm not afraid of the different sides of you.
I love all of you.
"The world is an ugly place, Martha."
"And it is full of brutish, cruel, nasty people."
I heard something on the recording from Gaad's office.
Is he in more trouble?
He's probably gonna lose his pension -- maybe even go to jail.
- You shouldn't feel sorry for him.
"- Well, how can I not?"
- Martha.
- This is tearing him apart.
Martha...
Gaad is not your friend.
"Oh, come on, guys."
Martha's ugly.
That's the end of the day.
Thank you very much.
Your graded papers are down here at the end.
You can pick them up on your way out.
I am invincible.
"Guys, Jill Taylor, 10 o'clock."
Man.
That's brutal.
"You know, you should just ask her out, man."
It's not like she's a rocket scientist or anything.
"Oh, wait, she is."
"Well, why don't you ask her?"
Because I'm already dating someone.
"Yeah, your right hand doesn't count, Miles."
It does the way I use it.
It does the way I use it.
"Hey, you know what?"
Maybe I don't even want to go out with her.
"Yeah, that's funny."
"You know, you say you want a life experience, right?"
"Well, I'd say getting down with that would definitely qualify."
Cam!
Boy genius.
You have to follow me now.
- Excuse me?
- You have to follow me now.
Come on.
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.
Our honored guest.
"- How you doing, Ben?"
- I'm okay.
He did it.
"Hurry up, we only have 20 seconds."
Here it is.
All right.
What would have happened if he hadn't given himself away?
This is a dangerous game.
That's a passenger plane!
Now the myth of Carrasco is finished.
"Damn it, Enrique, they're simply cleverer than us."
They should have got them by now.
Let's go.
- We can't get through there in the Jeep.
- I want Carrasco!
Don't you dare come back without him!
Over there!
Find him!
Find him!
Enrique!
We'll get you out of here.
- Did you shoot the bastard down?
- No.
It wasn't him.
- We were set up.
- I knew it would go wrong.
I sensed it from the start.
"Come on, we must get away."
Help me.
"Hurry up, but be careful."
They'll remember us for a while.
Bastards!
I've always wished for something like this.
The bloody bastards!
"Prisoners are taken out on work detail one block at a time, right?"
- Same time every day.
- An ambush?
When guards are vulnerable.
It's not like we're liberating the whole camp anyway.
"Assuming we can get them out, there'll be search parties."
They're not in any condition to run for long.
I'll need to find a place to hide them.
"I'll do more recon, map out a route."
Gather all the guns
- we have.
- What can I do?
You've been through a lot.
Just stay out of trouble.
"What, am I grounded?"
I do something wrong?
I didn't say you did.
- I want to help.
- And you can.
Someone needs to hold the fort.
He'll be all right.
We'll look after him.
I'll be fine.

"Now, I'm asking you for the last time."
Who were they?
"Now, you're not going to eat until you talk, so you may as well talk now."
"Now listen, Johnny, here."
Listen to me.
"Now, you tell me who those other fellows were and I'll let you go, see?"
"Come on, who were they, huh?"
Who were they?
- Lock him up.
- Mighty cold for this kid in there.
"Well, maybe it'll freeze him into talking."
Okay.
Come on.
I'm gonna find out who those other kids were if it's the last thing I do.
"All right, kid."
Come on.
Get out of there.
You got enough.
Go get your chart and report to work detail.
- I'll try and get you some grub later on.
- Thank you.
Wrap this around you.
I know you don't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
Skinny didn't squeal.
"Here you are, kid."
Of course I've thought about it.
It's all I think about!
- Really?
- Yeah.
Or have you just thought about yourself?
Do you think that this is good for him?
That kid is gonna hate us if he has to grow up listening to us fight all day long.
"So that's it, then."
What about me?
- Am I just so easy to walk away from?
"- Lisa, I love you."
Don't you fucking say that to me!
"You have no idea what love is, Chris!"
Lisa.
Listen.
We have a problem and we have to face it.
"Oh, you're right, Chris."
You are absolutely right.
"Get the fuck out, you fucking asshole!"
You know what?
"If you want to go, go."
I release you.
Go be free.
"But don't you ever expect to see me or your child ever again, ever!"
"Lisa, stop it."
"Jesus, stop it."
Just go.
Please.
Go.
- You're staying at a motel?
"- No, it's a hotel."
And it's really very nice.
I can still race!
What do you think?
A thing of beauty.
- McQueen made it!
- What?
He's not pitting!
You gotta get me out there!
Let's go!
Get me back out there!
McQueen's not going into the pits!
The rookie fired his crew chief.
The third this season!
- Says he likes working alone.
"- Go, go!"
Looks like Chick got caught up in the pits.
"Yeah, after a stop like that, he's got a lot of ground to make up."
"Get ready, boys, we're coming to the restart!"
"Come on, come on, come on!"
We need tires now!
"Come on, let's go!"
"- No, no, no, no!"
"No tires, just gas!"
- What?
"You need tires, you idiot!"
Looks like it's gas-and-go's for McQueen today.
Right.
No tires again.
"That's a short-term gain, long-term loss, but it's workin' for him."
He obviously knows somethin' we don't know.
"This is it, Darrell."
One lap to go and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.
He's got it in the bag.
I was.
"(SHE SCOFFS) Exactly - ""was""."
How long?
(SIGHS) 18 years.
And how many times did you do the dirty on her?
Never.
"Well, it's my life, and actually, I really like it."
"Oh, yeah, so what about the drugs?"
The meth?
"See, I think you've got one... maybe two months before your teeth start falling out."
"Come on, Jenny."
Eh?
"See, the thing is, I don't think you're doing this by choice."
Not really.
That's just a cuddly thought so you can sleep at night.
Nah.
"Need the coinage, rent to pay."
What do you want?
All right.
"Well, I can tell I'm not gonna change your mind, so why don't you just call your mum, let her hear your voice?"
It's not my voice she wants to hear.
She's no different from the freaks that get off on these films.
It's not who I actually am that matters.
It's who they wish I was.
Jen!
- I...
- Tell her I'm fine.
"All right, that's it, the show's over!"
"Come on, show's over."
"Oi, oi, oi."
Jenny Jones...
- Get off me!
"Iwas so thrilled, Alicia, to see you coming in alone today, just with canes, on your own."
Did you see?
Howwas rehab today?
Very good.
Are you tired?
"Yes, very."
Doesn't matter.
We'll do some additional exercices.
We'll do some leg stretches.
I've done 100 today already.
We'll do just a few more.
Good morning.
I'm here to see Mr. Sanz.
Come in.
Thank you.
The fetus was born dead.
It was a boy.
But Alicia woke up.
Benigno should be told.
"Given his mental state, I think not."
He could do something crazy.
But Icant lie to him.
"I'm his only friend, he trusts me."
I'll do it.
It's not a dilemma for me.
I'll tell him that Alicia is still in a coma and the baby is dead.
But you must promise me that you'll say nothing.
What about bail?
"It'll be very difficult, and expensive."
But we can try.
Number eight.
You got wet.
- Three.
- Okay.
"Sorry to ask this right after we ate, but did you sleep with that girl, Sunhee?"
No.
Then why'd she stare me down?
Did you two talk?
That's none of your business.
Did you have sex?
Just tell me the truth.
Tell me.
I'm just curious.
I didn't.
I told you I saw everything.
She really just came in and left.
"Plus, she's married."
And I really do not see her as a woman at all.
I'm serious.
So stop talking this nonsense.
"- Ouch, it hurts."
- Why are you lying to me?
Why are you being like this?
I interviewed her because she resembled you.
"I was missing you so much, but you weren't here."
So I just interviewed anyone.
We don't look alike.
And you know how she looks at me?
She got this contempt in her eyes.
Why would she?
She means nothing to me.
She's just nice.
"Actually, I feel sorry for her."
"Go on, and what else?"
- Cut it out!
- You're doing good.
- I know.
I've been on ice before.
I like your army jacket.
Is it from a real dead guy?
You're funny.
"Hey, you want to come back to my house and watch TV or something?"
- Really?
- My mom punched a cop so she's gone for a few days.
Uh...
"Yeah, sure."
Whatever.
Thank you so much!

"Leave us alone, Jimmy!"
"Oh, one lucky punch and you think you're tough now?"
It wasn't lucky.
It's such a blessing to have a husband who's so happy.
He's always singing.
- He loves to color my hair and do my...
"- Ginny, please stop."
"I'm really glad you and Greg are happy, but we are not doing well, okay?"
Frank's depressed right now.
Maybe he should take a Pray Away cruise.
We can barely afford to put gas in the car right now.
"It's just, he's really down in the dumps."
- He's usually so full of life.
"- Well, that's one way of putting it."
I just want my husband back.
"Can I see your driver's license, please?"
But I don't understand how that happened.
I just...
- You lose something?
- A few hundred pounds of baby food.
- Now are you gonna help or what?
- Sure.
Okay.
No problem.
Call Caltrans.
Tell them to get a unit to clear this up.
And will you take over here?
We're supposed to be at central for a court call.
All right.
Okay.
"When you get reloaded, just make sure that latch is secure, okay?"
Yeah.
I'll sit on it if I have to.
I'm sorry.
I could have sworn I locked her up.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
We're late.
Getraer gets nervous when I'm not on time.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, what's he gonna do?"
"I mean, you're already on probation."
Yeah.
"If he had his way, he'd put my whole family on probation."
"Honey, look."
It's gotta be worth at least 40 bucks.
Chippies.
I wasn't trying to make you feel bad.
I know you weren't.
"I mean, I did this to myself."
"I didn't get into college, all my friends did."
"I don't have a job, so..."
"See, there's really nothing for me to go home to."
Hi.
Hi.
Are you ready?
"Uh, yeah, I am."
"Wait a minute, Eric, what are you saying?"
"Cor, I'm not going home."
Cory?
"Eric, please."
Just come to your senses and tell me we're leaving.
"Oh, Cor, I have come to my senses."
This place is great!
"I mean, it's got Irene, it's got soup, it's got pie, why would I ever leave?"
"Eric, it's not your home."
"That's right, it's not."
"At home, I'm a loser."
"Here, I find happiness."
You're trying to take it from me.
"No, Eric."
You didn't find happiness.
You just pulled off the road.
"I mean, you can't stay here for the rest of your life."
You just pulled off the road.
Maybe this is my exit.
"Look, Eric, we've been gone two months, all right?"
Mom and Dad are waiting.
I think we owe it to them at least one of us shows up.
Yeah.
How long do you think we can go on like this?
"Still at this, are we?"
"So, you told me she was dead."
"Look, tell me."
"Burnt down, a man's worth $4.40."
- Excuse me?
- That's what you said.
- When?
- In the car.
"When all's said and done, you know, carbon and minerals."
A human being's worth less than five bucks.
I said that?
"Well, you know me, I talk a lot of shit."
"But if you say I said it, then I suppose I should believe you."
What about it?
We walk.
Both of us.
"Well, you might walk but her..."
That's impossible.
She knows too much.
She's got the codes.
She's got the cypher.
She's compromised.
It's gotta stop.
I'll get you a prescription for Ativan.
That will stop your conscience bothering you.
Yeah.
"Well, take a look at that."
It's a copy of the broadcasts.
The ones she stopped.
Number 14 might be of interest.
Take him.
"Dad, I am fine..."
You forgot these in the car.
We'll take care of that.
I have to be honest.
I don't need these anymore.
Shove them up your ass.
How about shoving them up your girlfriend's ass.
Stick them up your mother's cunt.
"Pick on someone your own size, asshole."
"Dad, I will go faraway."
Forgive me.
I am a faggot.
It's all my fault.
What's your show tonight?
"Here, this is for making a Zenne out of me."
You're a natural.
"Take this, idiot."
Go to my apartment and take whatever you want.
I don't need your filthy stuff.
Ah OK then...
Don't you ever wear colourless clothes again.
I don't want to see you in white ever again.
I'll miss you too.
Answer the phone.
Please.
You sneaky little cunt.
"You faggot's daughter, you!"
My brother is saving himself from you.
Your God left you a cripple.
You're gonna die here all alone.
Dad.
Drinks on the house.
"No, have the drink with me."
The drinks are on...the house.
I fucked kids like that in the can.
In the ass.
Fucking break up my party.
You been away for six years.
Everything is different now.
"I did my fucking time, Jimmy."
I came home and I want what I got to get.
I got fuckin' mouths to feed.
-You're gonna get it.
-You understand?
Get the door!
"Let me shoot him in his big, fucking mouth!"
Let's shoot him.
Fucking mutt dented my shoes.
His whole crews gonna be looking for him.
This is fuckin' bad.
What do we do with him?
We can't just dump him on the street.
Don't worry. I know a place upstate.
They'll never find him.
"Come on, let's get some more tablecloths."
I didn't want to get blood on your floor.
"Henry, go open your trunk."
We'll pick up a shovel at my mother's house.
She keeps a shovel lying' around here somewhere.
"Just keep quiet though, I don't want to wake her up."
Look who's here.
What are you doing?
What happened?
An investment to be clear.
Not a fucking handout!
That said...
I did remind him... of the night we shared together.
"And how it would be a tad embarrassing if, uh... well, if anyone found out about it."
"Which is technically blackmail, I suppose, but whatever."
I filmed it.
You see?
Suck it.
I think we can all agree.
That the truth hurts.
Here.
This will help with the pain.
"Thanks for the party, guys."
She's dead.
"Get lost, you bloody queer!"
Oops.
We're done here.
May I invite you all to join me in a toast?
"Yes, you can."
One year's out and in the end we're all still breathing.
Gin - fucking gin!
Gin - fucking gin!
Yeah.
"We'll be celebrating later, aren't you?"
"Uh, Jesus Christ!"
"Oh, we're going to be right at the end of that--"
Get off me.
"Chris, I've seen you in the shower you were to be in heaven!"
- It's the old lad.
"- Oh, bad to be on that!"
"- My Jordans, nigga!"
"- Shit, this isn't good."
- This is not good.
This is not good.
No.
No.
No.
They're coming over here.
- Fucking shit.
Why did you do that?
"- Yeah, I hit a fire hydrant on purpose."
"They're getting weapons, man."
"All right, what do we do?"
What do we do?
"Run, run, run."
"Run, run."
The men are still very jumpy.
A night on the grog will straighten them out.
Nature calls.
What do you think?
I think they started the party without us.
Who are you?
You do realize you only have one shot.
Which means you'll only be able to kill one of us.
And that whoever you do not shoot will have to cut your throat before the other hits the ground.
Ready?
Let the show begin.
Stand your ground.
Stand your ground!
Stand your ground!
Gather around me here!
Captain Taylor.
- I am good.
I am at home.
But I am going out after some time.
Where are you?
"What do you mean, where are you?"
I am busy arranging for your party.
What rubbish!
When did I say to throw a bash for me?
- You didn't say.
But I thought I should give you a farewell party before you leave.
I don't know when we will meet again.
"Karan, you are trying to entice me?"
"Sweetheart, I am not enticing you."
I like you.
I love you.
And you know?
It's not a crime to love.
"Karan, you know it very well that I don't have time.."
..for useless things like love.
"I am focused on my career, man."
That's why I am leaving Jaipur and going to Mumbai.
Okay.
Be focused.
Make your career.
But reach the party by 9 o'clock.
I have called all our friends.
"I am not too sure, Karan."
I will ask my mom and inform you.
Okay?
No asking.
I don't care.
You have to come.
Like every day of my life.
So why haven't you?
I don't know.
Come on.
I don't know.
I don't know.
It's-- I'm scared.
- Scared?
- Yeah.
You?
You're like the most confident person I've ever met.
It's very scary.
where would I go?
What would I do?
Anything you wanted to.
close your eyes.
Trust me.
They're closed. do anything.
Where would you go?
What would you do?
I'm right where l want to be.
You know what's funny?
When I was a kid I used to have the map of the world above my bed.
l would just point at various places-- close my eyes and just point.
And I promised myself that I would go visit those places.
And now I'm older and I'm still here in this small little town and I've never visited those places.
the funny thing is you actually got out. you followed a dream.
I really admire that.
You make it sound romantic.
It is.
Isn't it?
My dad-- he's a real son of a bitch.
Thank you...
for your help.
Your dinner is getting cold.
"I know you're not very happy with me right now, but I am only looking out for your best interests."
I made that noodle casserole you like so much.
"Oh, Amanda."
"Hey, hon?"
Where the hell are they?
"This could be the biggest move you bust all night, so we just wanna make sure you have it down."
Meet her at the door.
Compliment her.
Walk her over to the table.
Offer her a seat.
Yes.
Care to demonstrate?
Would you like a seat?
No.
"No, no."
You have to pull the chair out for her.
Oh.
And then just slip it underneath her as she sits.
Not too fast or you'll take her out at the knees.
Right.
Not too fast.
Why am I even worried?
You'll be fine.
Does it look okay?
?
I love this.
"The lights, the table, everything."
And the window in my room.
How'd you even get the idea for that?
- What?
- Where am I?
With me.
In my world.
What do you mean?
How could you bring me here?
I asked...
But you didn't reply.
"Obviously, I was drunk, right?"
Just a second.
What did you mix in my drink?
It took me 25 years to find you.
What?
What if I tell you that we've met before?
What if I tell you there was a time when we loved each other like crazy?
And then someone separated us.
What would you say to that?
Then I'd say that you have gone crazy and you need help.
No.
No.
I am not crazy.
Doctors too used to say the same.
They were treating me.
They were trying to erase the image from my mind.
But how could I forget you?
I found you.
All the questions became meaningless.
My existence is for you.
- This is what the universe wants.
- Just leave me.
Let me go.
"- Wait Saira, wait!"
Huge.
I'm the most wanted man on this planet.
Bounty hunters of all types are after me skin.
My face is plastered on wanted posters in every town on seven countries.
"Oh, yeah."
I'm infamous.
No.
I don't believe it.
Got it!
I think they're gone.
Are you sure?
"Aye, it's quiet."
Jump now!
- This might not work.
- Of course it works.
We're a lethal pair.
Behind you!
The arrow relies on the bow.
"The bow, on the arrow."
But they are not tied together.
"That would be pointless now, wouldn't it?"
Exactly.
"Together we are formidable but shackled, our power is pointless."
- We must be free.
"- Aye, free."
And we'll take them together!
Is that the best you can do?
I'd say we've wiped out our bounty-hunter problem.
- For now.
- Aye.
For now.
I was wrong about you.
"- Oh, great, now I'm all nervous."
- Don't be.
No man would invite you on his motorcycle unless he's ready to make a commitment.
You expect me to believe that?
"No, but you made lying look like so much fun, I thought I'd give it a whack."
"So, um,"
I'm going upstairs to throw out all my booze and not eat these donuts.
"Yeah, it is fun."
Morning.
"Oh, my God, I got flowers."
They're on my desk and you assume they're for you?
"Oh, I'm so sorry."
They're for you.
Hmm...
I wonder who they're from.
I wasn't even going to ask.
I know how much you value your privacy.
It's not signed.
"It just says, ""Had a great time."""
- Molly.
- What?
Are you seeing someone?
Someone I don't know about?
How am I going to help you cover it up if I don't know what you're hiding?
I've got nothing to hide.
But let's not mention these to my father.
"Or anyone who might tell my father, like... him."
"- Hey, Alex."
"- Hey, Stephen."
Alex?
One second.
Um... oh.
It opens up the room.
It can breathe.
Does it get you money?
You want it?
"Here, I'll give you the fucking money."
"If you want more, you can go down and tear some off the wall."
No.
I don't want your money.
I don't need it.
But I do need a door.
So I could close it behind me.
I thought you'd like it.
I do like it.
In some way I do like it.
It's dreary.
Of course.
"Arise, you wretched of the earth!"
"Arise, you wretched of the earth!"
"Arise, you prisoners of starvation!"
"Forjustice thunders condemnation,"
It is the eruption of the end!
Is this what you were thinking?
"- Okay, that's enough!"
You'll sing for me.
I'm not finished yet.
You're still singing for me.
- I have to ask Franz first.
You need written permission?
I'll think about it.
Don't take so long.
He found some chicks that aren't too bad either.
They're taller than you too.
He must've gotten the message.
Christine.
"Uh, I think the guy that you... you know, the other night when you and he... dirty."
All right.
I know.
"Just let him in, okay?"
I'll get this over with.
Thanks.
"Hey, lover."
Hey.
"Mmm, that was nice."
Yeah.
"So, have a seat."
Wow.
I haven't been in a gym in a long time.
Not since my wife left me for her trainer.
"It's okay, though."
It's been great for my daughter.
"She loves her new dad, and... she's in the best shape of her life."
"Look, uh, Stan... the other night, I was in a particularly vulnerable place, and, um, I think what happened between us was a little quick."
"Oh, I know."
Sorry again.
"Oh, no, no, no!"
I-I-I mean that I think we should go back to being friends.
"Yeah, but we were never friends."
"Well... maybe we should go back to being pre-friends, you know, like the way we were last week."
But we-we didn't know each other last week.
Perfect.
Are you breaking up with me?
In a gym?
I can't believe this is happening again!
"Stan, I'm so sorry, I really am."
All right.
"Hey, I was right."
This is the living room.
This is where we live.
And this is the couch where much of the sitting takes place.
"Aren't you gonna show me the, uh, upstairs?"
"Yeah, boy, yeah, boy, yeah, boy."
The upstairs.
I love the upstairs.
"You know, we weren't even gonna have an upstairs, but I made 'em put it in because I knew you were coming."
"Nobody told me about this girl thing, Shawn."
"I mean, no one warned me."
I thought they were just there.
I didn't know they were interactive.
You'll get the hang of it.
Sure.
It's easy for you.
Your hair moves.
- There's other techniques.
- Like what?
I don't know.
I just do hair.
"Yeah, but where do I get my technique?"
Ask your brother.
He's got the boom.
You know what?
Let's just forget this whole subject.
There are a million other things to do in the world.
"I mean, we're too young to worry about finding mates."
- You're right.
See ya.
- Where are you going?
Yeah.
"I mean, no."
"No, things aren't weird, or no to the sex?"
- Maybe we should just...
- You're right.
"Just concentrate on Figgis, and we'll figure this out later."
"No, I was gonna say maybe we should talk, but yeah, it can wait till after Figgis."
Ah.
We have the rest of our lives to talk.
"Yeah, unless he kills us first."
What a weird joke.
Regret saying that one.
"Wow, things are clickin'."
I'm gonna go make sure there's enough balls in...
in the ball pit.
Yup.
Important to get on them balls.
What is wrong with me?
"So then Trevor sends me a text, and he's like,"
"""At this point, I hate you."""
"I'm like, ""Oh, really?"
"'Cause you didn't hate me last week."""
Trevor sounds like a dog.
Right?
"God, I missed our daily dishes."
Me too.
"I'm sorry I'm not reciprocating with ""hot goss"" of my own."
I'm just worried about the Nine-Nine.
"Sir, they're gonna be fine."
They're my squad.
I should be there with them.
This is killing me.
- That's enough.
- I thought you quit smoking.
- The gum didn't work.
Who's she?
- That's my new partner.
- Not bad.
- You didn't know about that?
"- No, why should I?"
Coming back to the force?
See what you're missing?
Tommy!
- You want to get some dinner?
- What did I say?
- I just invited him to dinner.
- Go up there!
- He hasn't changed a bit.
"- Yeah, that's the problem."
- What do you know?
- We just fished out the body.
Don't play games with me.
I want to know what you know.
You don't want to hear it.
It's the same guy.
- The same guy?
As in Polish Hill?
- Fair hair.
Good bodies.
"These women were shot, not strangled."
They had neck bruises and were bound wrist and ankle.
- Eiler told me you know this girl.
- A lot of guys knew her.
"If I didn't know better, I'd think you didn't want to solve this case."
I like her.
"I like her, too."
She likes me.
I guess you didn't have your eyes peeled.
It was me she was flipping her frills and furbelows at.
"Just a minute, jim- here, here... if the lady comes up, i go backstage."
"If the eagle shines, the pass-through's all yours."
All right.
Uh- let me flip it.
Where did it go?
"I don't know, but you better hurry and find it."
The show's over.
She'll be going out with someone else.
"Nick, you go back to her dressing room and ask her if she'll go to a lobster party."
"Soon as i find this lucky piece, i'll join you."
Luke?
Yeah.
You go over to the astor house and reserve the best table in the place.
Yeah.
And send somebody here with a lantern.
Idiot!
Imbecile!
"You want to be an actress, eh?"
"Well, here is good luck!"
I've had just about enough of this!
Someone is at the door!
See who it is!
Yes?
"Oh, good evening, mademoiselle."
I see my flowers have arrived.
"Oh, you are mr."
Fisk.
And what if it does?
That means you're in contact with God or the Angel of Death.
Who are you in contact with?
We can't stay here like this.
Who's to say that within a week... I have a feeling it'll happen in the next three days.
You keep repeating the same thing!
"Look, Keyvan, you know what?"
Give me three days.
Just three.
Perhaps it will happen.
- And what if it doesn't?
- let's say it will.
We're wasting time.
Can't you plan things?
Plan things?
"No, I can't do that."
We say the same thing.
"If you can't do it, who can?"
Only God can.
"If it happens, we shoot our report and return to Tehran."
All right.
We just need to know what to do.
Say it takes three months...
- Behzad.
- Yes.
I've brought you bread.
Put it over there.
"Listen, kid, can't you hold your tongue?"
I can.
Who told you to talk about her son leaving?
I can't lie.
It's not a matter of lying.
- If you need anything else...
Yeah.
"Actually, um, is there any reason why people would be uncomfortable with me being here?"
No reason.
It's great.
But I'm swamped.
I should go.
"No, no, please."
"Really, I feel like I have spinach in my teeth and nobody is telling me."
We all just really care about the senator.
"Personally, I think you make a really cute couple."
Couple!
C...
Couple?
No.
"No, no, no, no, no."
We are...
That...
No.
There's no couple.
I'm just part of his communications staff.
- There's no coupling.
- I get it.
You want to keep it on the down low.
I don't want to keep it on the down or the low.
I don't want to keep it anywhere.
There's nothing to keep anyway.
- I arranged for you to go to his ranch.
- For the day.
For the day.
It was one day.
It turned into just a couple of hours.
Good.
I'm sorry.
"- No, no."
We're about to get started.
Have a seat.
Please.
So we can get out of here.
"Anna and everyone, we are required to be here on time."
We have a lot of work to do and it's not fair to the others if we're late.
"Yes, it won't happen again."
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I thought it might be helpful today if we watch the confession again.
Why?
And I don't know how it happened.
I don't.
"Danny, come into my office, please."
I heard about what happened last night.
That was crazy.
Must've been a horrible thing to discover.
First time I've seen a dead body.
It was shocking.
I bet.
I bet.
Did the police give you any trouble?
"Because if they did, I can take care of it."
You know I've got you covered.
"Thank you, Henry."
"No, I think I'm good."
She'd been dead for a couple of hours.
Ruled me out as a suspect.
"And she had a history of abuse, so they're pretty confident it was an OD."
Executive decision.
Horses can eat a bunch of pudding.
My cousin from Chernobyl had a dog this size.
He had three legs.
"My cousin, not the dog."
Something good did come out of Chernobyl.
Excuse me?
How much do you charge for pictures with him?
"Oh, it depends."
How nude do you want him?
Ew.
We mean for our kids... with the horse.
"I don't think the ""ew"" was necessary."
You don't know what you're missing.
"I mean, we're just walking him for our friend."
We'll give you $10 each.
Sold to the woman who...
"""Doesn't"" wanna see me naked."
"Come on, 18!"
Which is also the title of my adult film debut.
"Mine would have been called,"
"""Might As Well, I'm 24."""
"Excuse me, Mr. Moustache?"
Could you stop feeling my ankle with your toes?
I guess that's a no.
"Oh, 18 winner."
We won!
I'm rich!
Now you have no shot with me.
"Stay close, sweet cakes."
You're good luck.
"Here, buddy."
"Encouragement my ass, Daddy!"
You ain't even trying!
"Look, yoga's not my strong suit."
Yoga's not your strong suit?
"Oh, look at this one."
This little one is flexible.
She's good.
She's really good.
"Ooh, fantastic."
So you do like the lizard.
"Now is when we transfer the energy, you see?"
Yep.
And you just lay everything on top of her?
Yes.
Lay it on.
Stretch.
"That feels pretty good, hon?"
What?
"Am I straight enough here, do you think?"
Or am I curving a little?
Let me show you.
You feel the transfer of the energy.
"Well, it feels solid."
It is tantric energy.
Yeah.
It is karma.
Yes.
"Okay, now I want all my girls in a downward dog position."
"Yes, this pose contains a tantric hip thrust."
Now you and I will try this.
"You got a pose called ""Yoga Guy Gets His Ass Kicked',?"
"""Cause that's my favorite one."
Open it.
"Sure, There's nothing illegal."
And you know my nature.
Why?
Are you my cousin?
You nature depends on my future.
What's all this?
It's all mine.
You wear this!
"No, I sell these."
I was here on work so thought I should bring it.
I thought I'd make some money for the fare.
Please come...
Madam it's a perfect fit.
Show me the bag.
Which one Ma'am?
Right or Left?
Left.
Your left or my left?
Were you born in military?
"Doing left right, left right."
Show me the other one.
Open the zip.
"Ma'am there are two zip, which one, front or back?"
Take him away.
"Check him, open every zip on him."
And if you can't find the zip then rip it then put a zip there.
Then open the zip and then check him.
Everything is sold.
"It's the last one, for you."
Where is the dirty canal?
Why?
Who was it?
Do you want me to sort him out for you?
"Sure, I already offered..."
"Grow up, will you?"
No bullets?
No.
"Well, what's the point of giving you a gun... if they don't give you Jesus bullets?"
So we wouldn't shoot anyone.
I thought that was the point.
How else you supposed to keep the bleedin' peace?
"That's crazy, that is."
"It was no joke, all right?"
You had to look straight at 'em.
- Who?
- The Arabs.
Straight at them.
Straight into their eyes.
Mesmerize them.
"Easier said than done, I'd say."
Who are you telling?
Thanks.
"Hit me, will you?"
Get out!
"Hey, Sharon."
You forgot your piss.
Urine.
Da!
"Next time you try that, you better watch it."
"For God's sake, are you daft?"
He's not only daft.
He's such a roving eye for everybody in this hospital.
Did you see him?
"Don't freak, all right?"
We didn't get ripped off.
But Badger hasn't kicked in his full amount.
I know he was planning on pulling an all-nighter so he's probably still in the sack.
Then wake him up.
He can sleep after we're paid.
Why you gotta be such a hard-on?
You're not his pal.
You're his boss.
"This only works when they're scared of you, remember?"
Jack-off.
It's going straight to voicemail.
Voicemail?
"Just chill, okay?"
Count your money.
- Combo.
"- Yo, what's up?"
You seen Badger?
"Don't you cover for him, bitch."
"I ask you a straight-up question, I expect a straight-up answer."
Well?
They were too scared to tell me.
Badger got busted.
He's in jail.
"Honey, I'm home!"
Too slow!
What's up?
Got more lives than a damn cat.
Now if I could only learn to lick myself.
"What's up, guys?"
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
"I believe this is yours, my friend."
Thank you for lending it to me.
"But I still came out ahead, which is more than Mace can say."
"I'm close, so close."
One more door.
Yes!
Just one more door.
(sobs) Just one more door and I'm home free!
Wow.
Just... tell me why.
Why did you keep me in the dark for so long?
It's not that I didn't trust you.
I guess...
I just didn't want to share them.
"As long as I was the only human they confided in, it made me feel... special."
I think I know what you mean.
That might be why I've chased the Illuminati for so long.
"People may have thought I was a nut case, but at least I stood out."
"So, you two finally found each other."
"Yeah, I guess you could say that."
"- See you tonight, Captain."
- Have a nice day.
Hacker!
What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
"Oh, passing through."
"Man, you look like you've been through the wringer."
- (laughs) You don't know the half of it.
- (laughs)
"I may know more than you think, partner."
A lot more.
An Illuminati pin?
You?
I will wait for you.
Some people are born to wait.
I will come.
But I will be late.
Okay?

I'll stay for a few more weeks for the peace and quiet.
We'll take the next boat.
"If you'd been really ill, I wouldn't have told you anything."
This is why I'm here.
He's in Holland for a week.
"Good morning, Mr Haverman."
"Morning, sir."
Here you are.
Your morning portion.
The doctor says you'd better stay in bed.
"Yes, I understand, nurse."
Thank you.
"Later, after the visitor will have left."
Don't be too long.
You have to be fit for the cure.
Busybody.
That's what I'm ripping those assholes of the insurance company off for.
450 guilders a day.
-462.50.
What?
-I work in insurance.
"Oh, yes."
I know where he is.
And what he's doing this week.
It's Niels for sure.
I have to tell you something.
It's such an old case.
"Back then, you swore we'd liquidate him."
I'm not well.
It's been so long.
- What a pro.
What a pro.
- I didn't ask him to do that.
- He's aces.
"- Yeah, I know."
I didn't ask him to do that.
He just did it.
Really thoughtful.
- He was hilarious.
- I didn't dislike smooching Jay.
It's hot.
I'm just gonna say it.
"- Just, you know, say it."
- Just gonna say it out loud.
- that gay band We're Gay.
It was great because...
- We're Gay.
- We're Gay.
We had been shooting for a while when he came in.
And we had all gotten pretty tight pretty fast and it was just cool.
He came in and was just so awesome.
"- Yeah, he jumped in."
- Just jumped right in.
"Oh, man, do you remember Rafi put a bunch of Babybel..."
"- You know, the Babybel cheese things?"
"- Oh, yeah."
They come wrapped in wax and Rafi got a bunch of those and balled them up and put them in the back of Jay's jacket as a joke.
"And Jay was okay, but the wardrobe lady was not pleased with it."
"Oh, man."
"I won't name names, but she was angry."
What happened?
Did they melt all over the place?
- Are you lonely?
- Yes.
I have no expectations.
Nothing.
We should earn the real thing without any help from others.
But I think I still want to get it through people.
I know I shouldn't expect it of them.
- A real pleasure meeting you.
- Same here.
"Me, too."
"You know my intentions were genuine earlier, right?"
"Yes, of course."
You never quit.
So strange.
I wonder what's so fun about it.
They're just enjoying themselves.
Why did Nature have to divide us into male and female?
I'm so sick of it.
"You're a male, yourself."
You know that.
"Yeah, yeah."
That's why I'm like this.
Want to drink some more?
"Yes, well, as you like."
As I like?
So you want to drink more or not?
"Really, do as you like."
"If you want to drink, then do so."
"Okay, I'll go buy some more."
"Moonsook, I need to ask you something."
Can you come over here?
Sure.
How do you contact her?
How did you know I'm here?
"I cannot reveal anything, for the sake of protection."
"If I kept the names of women I spent the night with, my phone would need more memory."
What?
"I won't be meeting her in the future, so why would I keep her phone number?"
Such a player.
"You really are the one, really unlucky."
Could it be that...
"You like that woman, don't you?"
Your tastes are very unique!
Kim Yeong...
My name is Kim Yeong Ju.
She's related to a case I'm working on involving Mr. Lee Kyeong Wan.
"You, really don't know?"
I don't know.
Okay.
Fine?
Work hard.
Where is this woman hiding?
Excuse me!
Where are you going?
I see you're limping.
"The clinic doesn't have X-Ray, so I'm going to the hospital."
"Wait for me a moment, I'll quckly bring my car."
Get in the car.
I don't want to.
I'll clean up the mess I made.
Hurry!
Get in the car.
"I will take her, just go."
"Her leg is like that, because of me."
But now you've grown selfish and unkind.
"What's happened to your heart, jim?"
"It belongs to you, josie, just like you're going to belong to me."
Stop being afraid.
We've climbed above right and wrong.
"They're trying to pull us down, but they can't."
We're going higher and higher and higher!
Offering 150 for any part of 2 million!
"500,000 at 150!"
I'll take it.
Any more bids?
"If it breaks 160, it'll hit 200!"
We're not gonna let it break 160!
Jim!
She's just broke 150.
150?
157!
Why aren't you in the gold room?
"Oh, i'm getting jumpy, boss."
"I tell you, wall street's gone plumb crazy."
This thing's out of control!
Because i got 'em cornered!
I got all the gold there is outside the treasury.
"But i'm still buying, luke."
We can't hold anymore!
We're done for!
Let's get out of here while we're still alive!
I can't stay with you!
It's going to hit 200!
Stick with me!
You can't lose!
1621/2!
What we're gonna do is we're gonna take them out to the ocean.
You can't set them free in the ocean.
They'll die.
They're freshwater fish.
Okay.
"I hear you, sweetheart."
You are so smart.
We'll come up with plan B. We'll come up with a really good idea.
It won't be sort of kind of good.
It'll be a perfect idea.
You'll love it.
"All right, so we're gonna look at lipstick, we're gonna look at jewelry."
"- Shoes, bags."
- We're gonna...
"Oh, shoes."
- You guys wanna look at shoes?
"- Let's look at shoes, please."
"- Yes, heels."
"- Oh, my God, wait a second."
Wait.
- Do you wanna go in here?
"- Can't let them overheat, right?"
"Oh, my gosh."
Are the goldfish coming with us?

Grace.
What...?
All right.
If it's the truth.
It's all right.
She said... she had a dream she was pregnant.
I know this.
"Have you, um, have you seen the original?"
No.
It's in the National Galley.
"It's worth looking at, in the flesh so to speak."
It's very impressive.
Are you religious?
No.
"But, ah, I'm drawn to these images."
Why?
"Looking for reassurance, I suppose."
Have you found it?
No.
But I keep going back to look.
Just in case.
"So, um, what am I supposed to do about this Paul Fordyce?"
I'll let the police know and you should talk to them.
I can get them to pick you up from here if you like?
"Oh, no."
I'll be OK.
Silly boy.
I had a chat with the pathologist.
They're doing quite well.
What do you mean?
They're connecting you with three murders.
Don't get all hu_.
"It's the truth, isn't it?"
"We, or rather you, left a messier trail than I hoped we would."
- No.
"Well, how do you know?"
Ronon is correct.
I can definitely sense it now.
A female.
Ellia?
Get out of the way.
"No, please."
Don't shoot.
She's not what you think.
"She is my daughter,"
she means you no harm.
She's a wraith.
"Maybe so, but she's different."
I swear to you.
Let me guess-- wraith with a heart of gold?
She doesn't feed.
She's never taken a human life.
How is that possible?
"Please, lower your weapons, and I'll explain it to you."
It's all right.
Father...
"No, I won't let them hurt you."
I raised her as my own.
"You live here, together?"
This was part of a mine before the last culling.
"It's not much to look at, I know, but we don't have much choice."
The people of the village would not understand.
"Gee, I wonder why."
The villagers told us there was a wraith in the forest.
It came here in a crashed ship 10 years ago.
10 years ago?
"Who are ""they,"" friend?"
"Marauders, maybe."
I don't know.
"The same ones that killed Silmser, huh?"
Maybe.
Now will you take these chains off?
Not yet.
That's Times' place?
That's right.
And it never runs dry?
So they say.
Get away from the rifle.
You are getting hasty.
You'll get yourself killed.
"I could die of thirst while you was being too careful, too."
- Anything in it?
- In what?
In the bucket!
"Well, it sure is heavy."
That was my shot foot you dragged me in here with!
- You gonna die on me?
- No.
- You still shoot?
- Yes!
"Friend, you wouldn't shoot me in the back?"
"Friend, if I was gonna shoot you, it wouldn't be in the back."
"Cover, please."
Just tell him to put that down on the floor.
That weapon gives him adult status.
Tommy... put it down.
Please.
"You hurt my sister, I'll kill you."
My mom is not sick.
She's not sick.
Okay.
Where you going?
Away.
With a man I met from est.
"What do you mean, ""Away""?"
Away.
I don't know.
"Uh, for a few days."
"We've, um had this emotional connection for some time, and we just want to see if there is something else there."
You're telling me you're going to have an affair?
Sandra?
I might.
I don't know.
At least I'm being honest.
Go ahead.
Tell me that you're not having an affair.
I'm --
You know what kills me about the whole thing?
"Is that you didn't have any idea anything was going on -- you, Mr. Counterintelligence Genius."
You just didn't see it?
So you either didn't want to know or you didn't care enough to pay attention.
Who is he?
"Oh, it doesn't matter, really."
"- Who is he, Sandra?"
Who is he?
- It doesn't matter who he is.
What are you gonna do -- go arrest him?
Sandra.
Sandra.
Are you leaving me?
That's quite good.
"Well, I don't know, it was very catty."
Hmm.
"Now if you want to ask me any questions, you can ask me through your animal."
Do I have to speak in the animal language?
That's what I said.
"""Why were you at Simon Cowell's house?"""
I went to see Simon Cowell.
"""What was it about?"""
"Can we stop asking the same question, please?"
"Yes, sorry."
This is a place of respite and I wish to meditate.
"Now, I will offer you guys the chance to join me if you'd so like to."
Would you like to?
"Yes, we'd love to."
Take a seat.
Of course.
Love to.
"Meditation, have you done it before, Dermot?"
Right.
Now I sense that you two are searching for answers on the outside.
Yes.
PHONE RINGS
Whose phone is that?
That's not my phone.
It's not my phone.
I gave Philip my phone.
It's coming from you.
Why can I hear it coming from this direction?
It's not my phone...
It's coming from here!
What's going...?
I'm sorry to drag you into this mess.
"Tell me, who's behind all this?"
That's not my game.
I play by the rules.
I knew you would never tell me.
Take care ofJenny.
Weng won't stop until he kills you.
You'd better let me arrest you.
We'll stay here tonight.
"Sidney will bring me my money, and we'll leave tomorrow."
I'm scared those gangsters will find us here.
Don't worry.
This place isn't easy to find.
Why is it so dark?
I can hardly see anything.
"Jeffrey, turn on the lights."
Why don't you turn on the lights?
Jeffrey.
Please turn them on.
There's been a power failure.
Will your friend come back with the money?
I'm sure he will.
I'm sure he will.
Boss.
"Here's the $1 00,000."
Please check it.
You think he can kill Jeffrey?
"Boss, Sidney Fung is here."
What if he betrays you again?
I'd still consider him my friend.
He was so good to me.
- Where isJeffrey's money?
"Like I said, an open book."
How would you know that?
"I spent many years in Neverland, home of the lost boys."
They all share the same look in their eyes... the look you get when you've been left alone.
"Yeah, well, my world ain't Neverland."
But an orphan's an orphan.
"Love has been all too rare in your life, hasn't it?"
You ever even been in love?
No.
I have never been in love.
I think this little guy is hungry.
(Laughs)
"Go ahead and get whatever you want, sweetie."
- I'm gonna get directions.
- I will.
"Hey, man."
How are you?
I've been better.
"Listen, my wife and I... are really lost."
"I'm trying to get to Eugene, and I think we've been going the wrong way."
Can you show me what's going on here?
"Where are we, first of all?"
"Okay, wait."
Do I look like a tour guide?
Why don't you buy the map?
Then I can help you.
Okay.
Okay.
Now your problem is... (Map rustles)
Is you're way up here.
You see that?
"(Door bell chimes) Oh, my God."
- That's what I'm saying.
- His illness is your business.
"- Lf not mine, whose?"
"- Lf not now, when?"
Were you just talking about me?
"No, an old friend of ours, Gary."
"Oh, the guy with cancer?"
You told her?
She's not your wife.
"If I told you, you would've given it away."
- You don't think I can keep a secret?
"- No, but he would have read your face."
- You don't trust my poker face?
- Do you ever win at poker?
No.
Hey.
"Oh, I just saw your old boyfriend on TV."
- Jake Jarmel?
- Yeah.
I like those glasses he was wearing.
Where'd he get those?
- Why?
You don't wear glasses.
- I know.
But I need a new look.
I'm stagnating.
"I have to say, as a glasses- wearer, I take exception to that."
That's like me buying a wheelchair to cruise around in.
"Yeah, I've considered that."
"Look, how do I get in touch with this guy?"
He's having a two-day book signing at Walden's.
"You know, we had a really bad breakup."
"Dale, it's Gig."
- His machine.
- Oh.
"Um, see, things have got a little bit sticky over here."
"Slight change of plans, nothing that your deft touch couldn't rectify."
So either swing by or call back.
That'd be marvelous.
- Thank you.
- Great.
- Slight snag though.
- What?
"Well, Dale - blesshim - has been doing favor after favor for us."
"If it's not one thing, it's the other."
So -
- So what's your point?
- [ Sighs ]
"If he's gets the ticket back for us, we'll have to give him more money."
- No.
No way.
NO.
- That would only be fair.
There is a limit to my classiness.
- Quite obviously.
- Shut up!
I'll handle this.
You just leave Dale out of it.
Bunch of morons.
I have to do everything myself!
- Hi.
"- Well, well, well."
Look who it is.
An old face from the past.
"No, I'm not coming, I'm going to the fields."
"Come on, get in..."
No. I'm going to the farm.
"- Come on, I'll bring you back."
- No.
Why haven't you got out?
"Go on, get out."
Take the wheel.
Give my colleagues the keys.
Don't forget.
"Will he make it, doctor?"
"Yes, he just needed oxygen."
A jab and a respirator will put him right.
We've sent him to town.
Oxygen will save him.
- Where are you going?
- Down there.
There's a sick woman.
Perhaps you could see her.
All right.
- Do you mind?
"- No, no problem."
It's a miracle he survived.
He was lucky.
The stone got stuck before it struck his head.
Then some stones gave way.
"He was trapped, as if he was in a tiny cell."
He needed oxygen.
"If he gets oxygen, he'll pull through all right."
He was covered in dirt.
"""lf my guardian angel is hhe one I know,"
"""he'll prohech glass from shone."""
It's humiliating.
Yeah?
"How much did you lose, 500?"
A grand?
This is a way for us to get close again.
"Hey,"
I almost got killed a few weeks ago.
Sorry if it's affected your sex life.
That's not what I meant.
"Why don't you tell them,princess?"
Huh?
It was 3.
"Ladies, tango comes from the portuguese"
"""tangere."""
To touch.
It's all about touch.Not talk.
"Turns out talk is cheap,bro,huh?"
"A little tight,don't you think?"
It's fine.
We'll adjust it when we get in the ambulance.
"Man,look at this,my fingers are turning blue."
"I'm thinking your boyfriend's the senior guy here, maybe he can take a look."
My partner is busy.
I can wait.
"You didn't mean ""senior guy,"" did you?"
You meant white guy.
Is that what you meant?
Ha ha!
That's what he means.Kick his racist ass!
"You,shut up."
"And you, a little respect,or we'll leave you all here."
"I don't need your help,son."
I got it under control!
I took a goddamn red-eye to be here this morning.
I'm exhausted.
I hate this fucking city.
You can't talk to me that way.
I'm not a fucking kid anymore.
What the fuck happened to you?
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
"You're a dead man, you know that?"
It's not the first time I've heard that today.
Stupid fucking cop.
Do you know who my father is?
Where's the little girl?
I don't know what you're talking about.
"For your sake, I hope that's a lie."
"Look at you, you stupid fucking nigger cop."
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Where's the little girl?
[cell phone rings] [grunts]
Fuck.
[cell phone rings]
"Rook, did you--did you hang up the phone on me?"
"Is that what you did, Rook?"
I'm afraid Rook can't come to the phone right now.
Who is this?
Does it matter?
Put Rook on the phone.
It's too late for that.
If that's true
I'm talking to a dead man.
So they keep telling me.
Where's the girl?
Does she?
- Yes.
Your mother is very intelligent.
"If I get a chance, I would like to meet her."
For sure.
Tell me.
What will you have?
"I am good, sir."
I had breakfast just now.
"If you will call me sir here, you know what I am going to say."
I know.
I know.
Mother.
Anyway.
I saw your designs.
You seem very talented.
But why did you take so much time to express your talent?
"I didn't take time, Vivek."
"Those whom you trust a lot, they took time."
My designs were ready since a long time.
What do you mean?
Who?
I don't want to take anybody's name.
Fine.
Don't take names.
I understand a bit.
"But Gul, if I trust someone, I trust him completely."
What if somebody breaks your trust?
It hasn't happened so far.
"If it happens, I wouldn't want to see his face again."
Can you do that?
"- Yeah, of course."
Love you to drop by.
That's very kind of you.
Bring a guest if you like.
"A friend, lover."
Anyone you want.
"After you, sir."
Mr Harper.
Len.
How can I help you?
"It's this brochure of yours, it was found at a crime scene."
The police?
"No, no, I'm just making enquiries."
It's a personal matter.
"Yeah, those are our products, but...this isn't our brochure."
It has your company name on it.
"It's the 2010 line, but this isn't the promotional material we went with."

"I don't want to come in, and I won't."
"I'm a general, and I won't listen to you."
"Enough, Trelane."
Come along.
But why?
I didn't do anything wrong.
I was just playing.
We said come along.

I can tell.
Think he looks at y'all like you're some kind of heroes or something.
"Well, we're..."
We're far from that.
"You might want to tell him that then, if you know what I mean."
I've got a little girl in there who needs her daddy.
Dale doesn't know any better.
He watches TV.
I read nonfiction.
"Well, hey."
Hey.
"Hey, John, what do you say we head back?"
"Oh, no, come on, guys."
The night is young.
Y'all want some cookies?
We all do.
"No, we wouldn't dare try."
Very serious meal.
They're in here.
I got to go pee.
Pee off the porch.
Yeah.
Shit.
"You know, Dale..."
This whole case is our problem.
"I mean, what I'm saying is, you can be as involved, or uninvolved, in the actual apprehension of these guys as you want."
Assuming they show up.
"Well, if they do, I'll be there."
You got a nice spot here.
"Nice house, nice family."
You're a lucky guy.
I got addicted to one of those things.
Almost broke up my marriage.
What?
"Oh, no, no."
Not that.
"No, no, no, I met someone, and, you know, we had a nice time-- that's all there is to it."
"Wait, you're not going to see him again?"
"Maybe I will, and maybe I won't."
You can do that?
"Apparently, I can."
"Oh, crap."
Here comes Sad Dad.
Who's Sad Dad?
"Yeah, that's the other side of divorce."
"His wife left him three years ago for her personal trainer and he's been moping around the school ever since, trying to get any woman to show him the slightest bit of attention."
"Oh, that is so pathetic."
Which one is he?
Hey!
"Oh, my God, what are you doing here?"
You looking for me?
"Uh... uh, no, my kid goes to this school."
No way.
"My daughter, Alice, goes to school here."
Wow.
You would think that that would have come up last night.
"Oh, my God."
"No, no, no, no!"
Don't answer that.
Why?
Who is it?
Hi.
We're very busy.
Nita Caglar?
This is the name she spoke.
A Kurdish girl.
Okay.
She works a little for me.
"Without a permit visa, but that shit, I'm helping people."
How old is she?
15.
"A friend of his daughter, perhaps?"
Zana lives in Sweden with his mother.
What does this have to do with it?
When was the last time you saw her?
Six months ago.
Where is she?
She ran away from home.
Reported her as missing.
Why did she do it?
How should I know?
She contacted?
-I Would say is yes.
"If I do not get hysterical, does not mean I do not care."
Perhaps you do not have children.
Then I'll tell you something.
They are like a part of you.
But you can not make them be better.
"So if there is something more, take me to the police station."
One more thing.
I never liked cops.
No one died?
That's great!
Have you managed to track down the girl?
Let's wait for the experts.
I want to know when!
Years ago?
Months ago?
Weeks ago?
It was the night of the fire.
But it was friend sex.
I swear.
He was just so desperate.
He needed someone.
He needed comforting.
So you slept with him?
"Just so we're perfectly clear, you and Ben had sex?"
And he's been trying to make me feel bad about sleeping with Adrian!
And you didn't tell me?
You just let me feel bad about it?
You let me agonize over that one stupid mistake when the two of you did something just as bad!
Or even worse!
What did I ever do to you that you did this to me?
Were you ever going to tell me?
"I mean, if you did this just to get back at me for breaking up with me I think you'd want me to know."
"Geez, Alice."
That's really low.
Henry!
"Pick me up at seven, okay?"
Seven.
I got it.
I'll be there.
What?
You're gonna go through with this?
"Oh, yeah."
Game on.
Hi.
- I love you too.
I'm OK.
OK.
Your mom told me what happened.
I'm sorry.
- Sorry about missing dinner.
- It's OK.
I was just worried.
The last time you sounded like that...
I was with my sponsor.
Oh.
- That's good.
"- Look, I get it if you're angry at me."
I'm not angry.
I just don't know if I can handle it.
That's why they tell you not to date anyone your first year you're clean.
I never understood that before tonight because I couldn't deal with anyone or anything but me.
That's how it should be.
"Look, you weren't wrong to worry, OK?"
"I just don't think I'm ready for a relationship, Tyler."
I know.
I know.
I just want you to be OK.
"More than anything I want for us, I want that for you."
Come here.
It's OK.
Have you talked to Mom?
"I keep trying to reach her, but she's not picking up, at least not for me."
"Yeah, not for me either."

Where do you need me?
- We're all set.
- She's good.
"Thanks, Sam."
We'll take it from here.
I'll go check on his kids.
She's really not sure what happened.
She gave herself a good whack in the head.
We can't do anything if she doesn't identify her assailants.
That's okay.
"Like I said, she's not sure what she remembers."
She's not even certain it was intentional now.
Fine.
Let me know if she changes her mind.
You did the right thing.
The next step is to get your wife some help.
No.
The next step is for me to take her home.
"My wife is not crazy, okay?"
She had an accident.
It happens.
"I'd rather she chose to stay, than have psychiatry put her on forced hold."
She's gonna be with me.
She's gonna be fine.
Just leave us alone.
I mean it.
Pressure's up to 100 systolic.
Crit's 28.
Send another 4 units to angio.
We're passing ships.
We've met a few times.
You were on tour somewhere and we...
Yeah.
Yeah.
And one time I don't remember.
"No, I don't."
Yeah.
It was a crazy night.
LAUGHTER
"Ten past one, Rob!"
I've had similar experiences with Ronnie Corbett where the two of us are smashed off our tits.
Literally no memory of what time we left the golf club.
So it seems silly to ask you if you're a party girl.
Don't you try to deny it!
Slightly retired.
I'm a country bumpkin now.
You moved to the country.
Is that a real thing?
It's not like a stage!
It's real.
I've got a veggie patch and everything.
A veggie patch?
"It's not a euphemism, Noel."
So you're out in the country and you're acting more now.
I am.
Is that as big a thing as the music?
I think music's my first love.
I couldn't ever not do music.
"But acting, yeah, totally."
Love it.
I nearly wanted you.
Please sit down.
How do you like it here?
"It's a beautiful country, isn't it?"
- Yes.
- Could I see your papers?
"- Oh, come on."
You can overdo things.
- I'm supposed to check all civilians.
Certainly.
Don't get worked up.
There you are.
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Where are you going?
"To the radio room, to check everything."
These militiamen are fanatical.
They'd frisk their own granny.
- We have nothing to hide.
- But it's unnecessary.
He's just a busybody who's seeing how far he can go.
Who is he going to call by radio?
The Holy Father?
"Oh, I'm sorry."
Priests have a sense of humour too.
Everything's all right.
Open the gate.
We're going to the depot now.
We'll be there soon.
- I'm sure it's hotter here than it is in hell.
- It might get even hotter.
"Oh, I see, yes."
We're nearly there now.
This is the fuel depot.
My memory is like a 70-year-old granny's.
I always leave my phone in the office once or twice a day.
I'm one of the better cases.
One of my colleagues has a neck brace for her phone.
What?
You said that we don't have enough time.
Let's use it wisely.
Is something wrong?
"I know you could be angry, but you shouldn't be this mad."
What's wrong?
Did you order steak?
They are cold.
-It's ok.
"-Leave them, I'll order again."
I can see stars already.
-I said leave them.
-You said there's no time.
Let's just eat.
Sit!
There's salad.
"Bread, plenty to eat."
"Oh yeah, I should drink wine first."
When you called me stupid my stomach got upset.
Even stupid people get shocked from that.
Did you know that I was stupid now?
"This isn't the first time you were called ""stupid."""
"That ""stupid"" was different from ""stupid"" before."
Aren't you going to drink?
You have to drive?
So do I.
A glass will be ok within an hour.
It shows.
"I understand that, and thank you."
Yeah.
"So, uh, what's the plan?"
"Well, 7 AM we leave from here-"
"- Riley, no."
Stop.
He's not part of the crew.
Didn't my sister tell you?
You're not in.
"I understand that, Connor."
"I was just, wanted to see what you guys had planned."
No.
This is exactly my problem with you.
You're problem with me?
"You want me to take care of this, boss?"
Step back.
You just tell me to step back?
Don't tell me to step back.
I'll step back if I want.
"I'll step off, I'll step up to the streets if I want to."
"You know what my problem is with you, Ollie?"
Your lack of respect.
That's my problem with you.
"I, I respect you."
No you don't.
You don't trust me.
Never have.
Maybe that's because you've landed me in jail twice.
That's not helping.
You're not helpin'.
Where'd you get this guy?
I told you to play dead.
On your feet.
Hold on just a second.
Where are your manners?
"If you try something, I'll kill her!"
Don't make it worse for yourselves.
Come out with your hands up.
We won't hurt you.
"Aldin, I'm here!"
Don't worry anymore.
Your Renato is here.
You're gonna ruin everything!
"Renato, I want to go home!"
Don't worry.
I'll take you home.
"Shut up, for God's sake!"
Get him out of here.
Don't talk to me in that tone of voice.
Don't get so excited.
I'll keep still.
Tie him up!
Listen to me.
The dastards took a shot at me!
Ask for a plane.
In exchange for what?
For that.
For that thing?
Would you exchange a plane for that?
"A child, a woman, a priest, yes, dut that?"
Pretend I'm not here.
It doesn't matter.
You have two minutes... or we'll open fire.
"Come and get us, you dastards!"
"You'll find out what's wrong, won't you?"
- You said you could.
"- Sure, my love."
"And you've always got me, in case of need."
Or did you want us both?
"No, I'm not like that."
Not the one and the other.
- lt's more either/or.
- Either/or?
What are you two either/or-ing?
"Gerard asked me about my morning, and I have to work."
"It's either working, or neglecting the salon."
Working?
Today?
I've taken the whole damned week off for you!
"It's just this morning, sweetheart."
Monday mornings I have to see my salesmen. I'll be froe this afternoon.
That's great!
I'll be bored to tears meanwhile.
- Do something with Gerard.
- He's here to work too!
So I don't work this morning.
Yes... show him around.
Or talk to him.
Perhaps he'll write about us.
Then we'll be in a book.
What's the use of being in a book?
You know what?
Take the car.
I don't need it anyway.
Shall we?
I have to get to the meeting.
Did you book this room in advance?
What do you think?
Did you push me into the lift on purpose?
"I just wanted to get to know you better, because you're the most popular girl in our company, ... but no one's ever dated you."
Please excuse me.
"Are you angry with me, princess?"
No!
Don't!
No!
I've got to have you.
I'll take them off myself.
I don't want you to laugh at what you see.
I'm not sexy.
Don't worry.
We're in a hotel room on the 32nd floor.
"If an earthquake hits, we'll die together."
I'm scared.
Moan more.
Is it nice?
Move your hips more.
Hold me tighter.
Shall we go to that hotel that has a revolving bed next?
"Yeah, I've always wanted to go there,"
You know how sexy your voice sounded?
"I liked it,"
Are you comparing me with someone?
Who?
Look at the TV.
- Come on.
Just look.
- l don't want to.
Nami's pussy's sucking my penis in.
"Bankers' conference, Vienna."
Sorry.
- You couldn't tell me any sooner?
"- Sorry, I forgot."
Okay.
Let's go outside and talk.
What is this?
It's quite noisy outside.
What silent kind of a conversation do you want to have?
"We talk a lot, don't we?"
But we don't listen to this.
I think they are both conspiring against us.
We have no control.
So what now?
"So now, let's leave them alone."
They are acting smart.
"It's all about trust, right?"
So let's see what they do when they are alone.
One week.
Away from each other.
And what if they don't mend their ways?
Next level?
Do you really have to go?
It's good in a way.
"If you don't fast, you don't enjoy the feast."
"""Come to me, my love..."""
"""Come to me..."""
"""This helpless soul awaits you."""
"""Come to me..."""
"""Come to me, my love..."""
"""Come to me..."""
"""This helpless soul awaits you."""
I didn't mean to kill him.
I didn't mean it.
He's all right.
I didn't mean to...
He's fine.
"Calm down, be brave!"
- You stay there!
-Jeffrey!
Let's get out of here.
Then you can arrest me.
Let's getJenny out of here.
The car's outside.
Come on!
I won't let you put me behind bars!
Throw the gun down.
You wouldn't kill a cop.
Thankyou.
You could have killed me with one shot.
I don't kill anybody until I know they are the real enemy.
- Do you really know me?
- Fate controls everything.
The only person who really knows me turns out to be a cop.
You could always give yourself up.
No.
I made a promise.
I keep my word.
"Sometimes, I really envy you, your freedom."
It's something I don't have.
"I believe in justice, but nobody trusts me."
I have the same problem.
You're an unusual cop.
And you're an unusual killer.
Everything's near a beach.
"- Okay, then Tallahassee it is."
- Tallahassee it is.
Are you sure?
Is this... what you really want?
What I really want is you.
What is that?
Keeps the time.
(Crow caws)
You have somewhere to be?
"We can mark watches, take turns sleeping."
"We'll most likely have to walk through the night again, so we should rest while we can."
I'll take first shift.
I'll stay up with you.
Okay.
When's the last time you slept?
I don't really sleep now.
Not after what I've been through.
Sleeping curse.
"The one time I did sleep, I had horrible nightmares."
It's a side effect.
Same thing happened to me.
It did?
Mm.
I had them for months.
Charming... my husband... he used to wake me.
"When I cried out, he'd light a candle."
He said it would capture the nightmares.
He'd watch over me as I fell back to sleep.
Sounds like he lives up to his name.
Yeah.
Um... why don't you try... to sleep?
"You know, a car is like a man."
It needs to rest and restore itself.
It's given up the ghost.
It's overheating.
Can it be mended?
"Yes, it will work again."
Don't ask so many questions or I'll give up the ghost too... at this altitude.
I've forgotten my book.
- What?
- l've forgotten my book.
"Don't worry, the others will bring it."
I have exams.
They'll be coming up to join us soon.
I have to study.
I'll tell them to bring it.
I have to study to have a good grade.
What a pest...
"Ali, bring him up the book."
Where is it?
On top of the dashboard.
People always come this way?
"No, there are several different paths."
It's a tough one.
This isn't the main path.
Where is it?
It's a long way off.
This path is shorter.
- ls that why we've taken it?
- Yes.
"Wait, why are you going so fast?"
It was the best way!
That's what you want.
And so what if they laugh?
- So what?
- Don't tell me what I know... you haven't been through things like me.
"And I hope I'll never do, if that makes me so scared."
- I'm not scared!
"- Yes you are, Violet."
"You don't trust anyone, or anything.."
You never did.
I trusted you!
What?
I said I trusted you!
When did you stop?
The second I saw that goddamn dress on your back!
That's just perfect then.
Why?
Because now you don't have anything at all.
- So what are you trying to say?
- I just said it.
"Say it again, if you have the guts."
- You heard me!
- I'm gonna kick your ass!
Cut it off bitch!
You're gonna mess up my new dress.
My landlady was coming up the street.
I was just... just messin' with her.
Never shot a gun before.
- How was it?
- What do you aim on for some new shoes now?
- Shut up about it!
- You shut up about it!
- Make me!
- I just did!
And also I'd like us a decent stove.
This one is covered in fat.
"It'd be nice to have like a white, beautiful place and a decent stove."
It's not a lot to ask.
"Wow, don't look so surprised."
Even a call girl can scramble an egg.
You know what's funny?
I don't think I ever cooked for a guy before.
I mean not even my husband.
Jesus Christ.
Where is he?
Who?
You know who.
- Trevor.
- Don't.
"Jesus, Trevor, what's wrong?"
"This, Ivan."
"He's your ex, isn't he?"
What?
Why is he doing this?
"It's because I'm fucking you, isn't it?"
Now it all makes sense.
"I'm fucking you, so he's fucking me."
Where is he?
"Hiding in the closet, beneath the bed?"
"I don't know what you are talking about, baby."
"Ah, don't baby me."
"Yeah, baby."
I'll change my whole fucking life for you.
"I'll do anything you want, baby."
"You know what, I don't deserve this."
What did you do?
- All right.
OK.
Spare me the lecture.
I already know what you're gonna say so I'm just going to fast forward through all the bull crap that you're about to...
You should be happy for Justin he's your...
Oh.
"I'm so disappointed in you,"
Danny.
Good night.
Let's get high and watch wrestling.
"To be fair, that is what I say first thing in the morning."
"- Danny, Justin's your best friend."
- So?
It's OK to be hurt that he's leaving.
Don't you understand that this is all a ruse on
Justin's behalf?
He's not even really moving out.
Look.
All these boxes are empty.
See?
Oh.
It's all of his khakis.
- I guess he really is moving out.
- Aw.
"Danny, I know how scary it can be to admit how you really feel."
"I mean look how long it took me to admit how I feel about Burski but now I can look you straight in the eyes and I can say ""I love Burski""?"
You don't even realize you said that as a question.
I really do?
I like him.
I do.
OK.
I like him.
"Mate, I'm as happy as a pig in shit."
"No, let's be honest."
It's not working.
"No, let's be honest."
It's not working.
"You're better off trying to run your own outfit, Greg."
"You're better off trying to run your own outfit, Greg."
"I'd rather a 2IC that was 100% happy,"
"I'd rather a 2IC that was 100% happy, not just 90%."
not just 90%.
You know?
You know?
This is what I'm thinking -
"This is what I'm thinking - pay you what I owe you, plus a few extras, pay you what I owe you, plus a few extras, we'll shake hands, part as friends."
"we'll shake hands, part as friends."
What do you say?
What do you say?
What extras?
How's a brand-new car sound?
What extras?
How's a brand-new car sound?
Plus a bag of your favourite scag as a bonus.
Plus a bag of your favourite scag as a bonus.
I could live with that.
I could live with that.
Lennie McPherson?
Lennie McPherson?
I am he.
I am he.
Phil Scott.
I rang you.
Phil Scott.
He's just sabotaging himself.
He's sabotaging this account that would mean so much to us and... I can't even say anything--
"Oh God, Patty."
What would I do?
"I mean, how would I survive?"
"Camille, Camille, it's okay, honey, you're going to be okay."
"No, you don't understand, I need him. I'm not like you."
"Wait, wait, what am I like?"
"I didn't mean that, I just mean I need him, I really need Andy to live."
This is incredible.
Right. I'm sorry that...
H i.
We can go downstairs.
"No, lt's fine. I was just..."
- l should probably go.
- No.
"No, don't go."
"- So, your room is..."
- A mess.
Different from the last time I saw it.
"Okay, well, I'm going."
I'm on hold.
"Rosenfeld, I got to call him back."
Good morning.
How long have you been up?
A while.
You can have the first shower if you want.
"That's okay, you go ahead."
There's nothing edible in here.
"Don't be ridiculous, sweetie."
That things crammed full of stuff.
Let me look.
-Just don't bustin' my balls.
"Hey, Tommy..."
"If I was gonna break your balls, I'd tell ya to ""go home and get your shine box."""
This kid was great.
"I used to call him ""Spitshine Tommy."""
I swear to God.
"Oh, he'd make your shoes look like fuckin' mirrors."
Excuse my language.
He was terrific.
He was the best.
He made a lot of money too.
"Salut, Tommy!"
"No more shines, Billy."
What?
"I said ""No more shines."" Maybe you didn't hear about it..."
You been away a long time.
They didn't go up there and tell you.
I don't shine shoes anymore.
Relax.
What's got into you?
"I'm breaking your balls a little bit, that's all."
I'm only kidding with you.
Sometimes you don't sound like you're kiddin'.
"You know, there's a lot of people around."
"Tommy, I'm only kidding with you."
We're having a party.
I haven't seen you in a long time and you get fucking fresh.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you."
"I'm sorry, too."
"It's ok, no problem."
"-Alright, salut."
Now go home and get your fucking shine box.
- Sorta.
"It's hard work, ain't it?"
"Hey, I'm just happy to help out."
That's what I hear.
"So, uh, can you do me?"
Pardon?
"What you did for lester, i want it done."
I didn't do anything to lester.
"Look, he's right over there."
I sit alone in a room all day praying for death to come.
You got to do this for me.
Please.
Listen to me.
I killed 5 men in my life.
4 of them had slanty eyes and were shooting at me and my buddies.
The other one was a drunk driver who ran over my 10-year-old nephew.
They all had it coming.
"But I'll be goddamned if I'm gonna kill a war hero, a brother in arms."
I just won't do it.
Then you're a fag.
"Say that again, war hero or not, I'll kill you."
You are a fag.
"Ok, all right."
We're on.
5 goddamn miles.
"You know, i nearly had a heart attack."
My legs feel like jell-O.
"Oh, that's all right, dude."
You'll get used to it.
"Yeah, when?"
"Uh, depends on you."
You're pretty good with that thing.
"If Vlad wants his crazy Mexican, he should go after him."
It's pissing me off.
The last girl is off with a client.
"Down, down, down!"
He's gonna get a blow-job here.
"Fuck, he must be desperate to get a woman here."
What do you care?
You don't come here on holiday.
You're right.
I forgot that you were an expert.
You're out of line.
"Fuck, you're becoming a pain, Gilou."
- We can't say anything any more.
- Don't worry.
You'll soon be rid of me.
And Laure?
Tell me it doesn't hurt to leave her.
"Me, I would understand, but Laure?"
"Go ahead, say it."
Say it!
They're moving.
Gilou to Laure.
"The guy is going away with the girl, what do we do?"
We follow?
"No, we wait."
They're done.
Let's go.
Why don't they come back?
Are you sure the pimps didn't pick them up?
They must have picked them up somewhere else.
"We'll come back tonight, we've got to stay on their back."
"Everybody, get some sleep."
"I mean, what the hell do they want with us?"
They wanna kill us.
Make sure you don't cancel the broadcasts.
Grab that.
Let's go.
Here.
"That's all the information from the laptop, in case..."
"I don't know, in case we don't get out of here."
Drink that.
"""Of course we'll get out of here, Katherine."
"Don't you worry about a thing."""
You ever get used to it?
Used to what?
Bodies.
Dead people.
Seeing them.
No.
They never seem to stay dead.
How's it going over there?
"There's stuff on here, but it's password protected."
"I know, but can you open it?"
I don't know.
I'm trying.
How do we know all this mayhem hasn't already happened?
We don't.
Good.
Just keep working.
Fuck.
Can you just talk to me?
"Yeah, what do you wanna talk about?"
Anything.
Just regular stuff.
Get in.
Where did you go?
"Hey, where did he go?"
Go inside.
Where did Kutty go?
Come here.
Where did you go?
Where did you go?
To pluck guavas.
There are only stones for 12 kms.
Where did you get the guavas?
Tell me the truth.
Where did you go?
I won't tell you.
Tell me.
I won't tell you.
Small boy!
Don't you fear me now?
Konda Reddy says that Singamuthu is in this quarry.
And is insulting me with a camera.
This bastard says that he went to pluck guavas.
Don't you have any fear?
"Until he tells me where he went, he must lie there bleeding."
"If anyone tries to save his life without my knowledge, your children's fate will be very much similar to his."
This is Cuddapah Raja's line of death.
"If anyone treads on it, I will kill him."
"Kutty, where did he go?"
He didn't come for lunch either.
He can't stay hungry.
"Kutty, come fast."
We might miss the bus.
Someone tell me where he is.
- l don't know anything.
- Not even the shake?
That's the first time I've heard of it.
- Would you like to dance?
- Are those sandwiches good?
Excellent.
"But if you want to dance, go ahead."
"Come on, what are you afraid of?"
I don't know what to do with my feet.
"No one else knows any better, don't be silly!"
But they know I can't dance.
You're not a little boy.
We're already in the ninth form.
"We are, but I don't know how to."
What does that matter.
Do you think anyone knows?
I'm not going to make a fool of myself.
"No one knows, they just jump around."
"Come on, what harm can it do?"
"If I don't know how to dance, I won't."
Excuse me. I'll tidy myself up a bit.
My wife...
- What is it?
- Come in!
Come in!
This is my wife.
"If you don't mind, I'll change."
"I'll take this T-shirt off, it reminds me..."
"This way, please."
They've come about...
- l don't know what.
- Your son.
Then you whacked your aunt and uncle.
"Shut up, Calum."
I'm just saying.
At least with Lenny you know it's someone who probably deserves it.
Not just some scared kid in a trench.
"I didn't fight in the trenches, Calum."
You wouldn't be going to see your sister if Lenny hadn't got you out of prison.
"Yeah, well, I'm not gonna do it."
OK.
He can find himself another hitman.
I'm sure.
"OK, kids, lunch is ready."
You should get yourself a new map.
Nah.
This is my only school prize.
The names are out of date.
I know.
But the old maps are the best.
The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics that's a brilliant name for a country.
Are you gonna talk to me?
What do you wanna know?
How did you get out so early?
Where you're living now.
What you're planning on doing with your life.
I'm out on licence.
Living in a kind of halfway house.
My life?
"I don't know, Jess, you're gonna have to give me a little bit more time on that one."
Is that it?
Of course it's not it.
I did it for you.
No.
"So, you hated her."
No.
"No, no, no."
"Uh, no, she was a nice person, just sometimes she wasn't nice."
Now we're getting somewhere.
I saw that!
We have several eye witnesses that place you at the scene of the crime and a few hundred of 'em overheard you say you wanted to kill miss Weather.
"No, no, I di- I..."
"Okay, maybe, but I..."
"Look, I just..."
That's not the kind of thing I would ever...
"Okay, look..."
"I know, I know, I know, I gotta stop babbling."
"I gotta- and I gotta stop laughing nervously, right?"
She's going down.
I heard that!
Look you don't know what I'm going through.
You try being pregnant 27/4.
It's confession time.
You did it again!
Hey.
I'm Shaye.
"What are you doing here, Shaye?"
There's no way Corrinda coulda killed Heather.
And I have the footage to prove it.
Shaye.
"Look, I'm not gonna let my baby momma do jail time."
Even if I don't plan to help with the kid at all.
Mm-hm...
"Okay, I'm so mad!"
"I am so mad at her,"
I could just kill Heather Weather right now.
"Well, it wasn't just that."
"When we met, it was like fate brought us together."
Now what's it doing?
I'm not a big believer in fate.
"Yeah, well, I hate fate."
"Oh, let's not make it mad, though."
I can't believe this.
I'm gonna take the car to go get some coffee with this guy.
What?
I'll be back soon.
"He's really, reay nice."
And he likes my hat.
Okay.
"- So, you're happy."
- Me?
"Oh, yeah."
It's all good.
"I mean, Yonk's a lot older, so we're into different stuff, and-and we have different friends."
"And he's away a lot, promoting the Yonk Allen Barbeque Grill."
Okay.
"But, I mean, how cool is it?"
I'm married to Yonk Allen.
It's-it's awesome.
"Yeah, I mean, he was a huge football star, so, you know, he... got hit in the head a lot."
"But he takes really good care of me, and he's very sweet."
"Sometimes mean, but-but mostly sweet."
"Well, yeah, that's - that's just like your dad."
- Yes.
- Yes.
"Hey, babe."
Time to go to the airport.
I'll be right there.
- Good!
Why isn't the sign up?
Hi everyone.
"Well, at least it's finished."
When do I get the money?
When this thing is up.
Tell me Nora.
Wouldn't you rather work over there with us...
Instead of wasting your time over here.
Oh no!
We're wasting our time.
What's going to happen to us.
We won't survive!
He's got a screw loose!
"By the way, does your brother have the money?"
"Yes, he has the money."
You can pick it up right now.
Finally some good news!
"Great, right?"
Maybe something will actually come out of your hotel.
Although I would fire the bellman.
He's got a screw loose.
Tom?
Tom is the way he is.
"But you Toni, how are you?"
I don't have a screw loose.
I'm an entrepreneur.
But I shouldn't say that too loud.
And what else are you?
The sign goes up tonight.
It's taken long enough.
"Hi there, I heard you have my money."
"Would Elisa roast it, just for me?"
If you catch one.
"Come, come here..."
Got you at last!
I caught it!
Help!
I'll show him yet!
"I'm only little, but I'm nifty, see."
"Jean, I discovered something awful!"
We'll write to daddy about your new tooth!
He'll be amazed at you.
When he comes back.
"My little turtle-dove, if it weren't for you..."
So that's the way it is!
That pigeon must be done away with!
Where am I?
What is this?
What have I done to deserve this?
A sword!
"You ugly bird, there..."
I'll get you yet!
Damned bird!
"We'll wring your neck, no more love-notes!"
"Good morning, Elisa."
"Hello, my little devil, have you seen my pigeon?"
"No, let's hope a fox didn't get it!"
Beast!
"I was frightened, where've you been?"
"Good morning, Elisa."
"Did you sleep well, Johann?"
"How else, under one roof with a lovely woman!"
For you I'd sleep on a bare rock!
"I'm telling you, Joe pulled a gun on Patsy."
"A guy like him, self-defense?"
Not a chance.
"- If you killed him, you're out of luck."
- But I didn't kill him.
You're okay.
Better dive in somewhere till you find out for sure.
You gotta get out of the state.
"Mike, find a hideout."
Quick.
For what?
You've got that much head start.
Keep in touch with the hospital.
"When he goes, you start going."
Laying down on me?
You gonna cover me?
Not if he passes out.
"He's living, I can cover you."
Newspapers won't print a word.
They won't look for you.
If he goes-
"- Patsy, I don't have to kid you."
"--you're all washed up, you're through."
"Listen, get across the state line."
Get in touch with Nasetti.
He'll help you find a safe place.
Go ahead.
Okay.
Take your hats off.
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.
Doesn't seem like Sunday without Patsy around.
"Head to the south, See what I can find."
"Yeah, copy that."
Didn't see once piece of gold In that hole.
Am I headed In the right direction?
You need to turn right.
Turn right.
Look where he is.
He's way out there.
He's on his own.
I don't know.
It's looking like.
"All the right materials, Nice heavy material,"
But there ain't Anything here.
Now I'm starting to get Worried.
I can't see over here.
100 miles East of nome.
At the bluff...
Shawn pomrenke's Pump motor has run out of gas.
"And within seconds, mr."
Gold Will be out of air.
Here he comes.
We ran out of gas.
Umbilical's All twisted up.
Oof.
Out of breath.
That was a lot Of hard work that time.
When Just doesn't go right.
"When things are breaking And there's no gold,"
It gets stressful.
"As soon as that pump died, I could tell the air pressure."
Was dropping And I was losing air.
It was off.
- Go ahead.
- Short and sweet.
"I want half the money, or i'll have you arrested, and might even do it on the air, live."
- Imagine the ratings.
"- I'd like to see you try, asshole."
- You're gonna see me.
"- I'll kill you, I swear to God!"
- I'm gonna kill you!
- You treacherous little bitch!
You got one week to get your shit together.
- You listening?
I want the money.
- [Door Slams]
Okay.
Okay.
"Okay, let's do a little math."
"You want 20 percent, Dale wants half a million, and Dick wants half of everything."
"I don't have a calculator, but it seems I'm in debt again!"
Dale's money comes out of your share.
He's your friend.
- Not my friend.
He's his friend.
- I hardly know the man.
Who cares?
It's all fucking moot now.
The only thing that's moot to me is the Dick Simmons issue.
"You get a toothache, you pull the tooth."
What does that mean?
- Let's kill the son of a bitch.
"- Oh, God!"
- [Crystal] Yes!
- No!
"Guys pulling out, that's how I ended up with a kid in the first place."
"All right, fine."
I'll do it.
But it's not fair.
You asked me in the middle of sex.
"I was like: ""Uh, uh, uh, uh..."
"fine, I'll take him to Dave  Buster's."""
"Okay guys, quick announcement."
"It's a new year and I wanted to spice things up a little bit, so I decided to dye my hair red and then I chickened out."
Thank God.
Because red hair is the worst.
"However, I did convince Candace to do it."
Yeah!
I love it.
No.
I love it.
It's so good.
It's like a...
like a nice warm bowl of tomato soup.
"If I had a grilled cheese, I would just dunk it on your head."
No I love it.
Like your whole head's on fire.
"I love you, fire-head."
Yeah.
"All right, Brett, I'm going to kill you."
- What do you have against red hair?
- I love redheads.
"When you sleep with them, it's like putting a fire out with your penis."
Just look.
The first time my dad cheated on my mom he was
- dressed as Ronald McDonald.
- What?
It doesn't come up that often.
Maybe it's the neighborhood.
T om.
-Larry.
-Wow.
"Well, it's not the battery."
"In the morning, I'll check the fuel line for you, the alternator, the pump."
"You know, it could be your plugs are worn down."
I'll replace them for you in the morning.
"In the meantime, uh... could I give you a ride home?"
"Um, no, I can walk."
"So, what do you think?"
Can you help him?
I'd much rather do something for you.
"Well, what could you do for me?"
"Well, it seems like you've forgotten just about everything."
"Well, I remember the basics..."
but it's...
I'm not concerned about myself.
It's Frank I'm worried about.
"You know, it's just not that important to me anymore."
Poor man.
Look at that woman.
"Oh, my God."
Her top is so low.
And her skirt is so high.
That is bad.
It is.
"It's very, very bad."
"Are you, uh... what I think you are?"
"Well, I'm not the public health nurse."
Would you...
"- I love you too, sweetie."
What's up...?
I literally just walked in the door.
What did I do?
You missed her talent show.
"No, I didn't miss it."
"That's, like, next Thursday."
"No, it was last Thursday."
It was on the school calendar.
What did she do?
She was a flag twirler.
That's a talent?
"She practised for like six weeks, John."
She thought you were gonna be there.
It would've been really nice to have a bit of a reminder.
"- Come on, I'm not your secretary, John."
- I'm not asking you to be my secretary.
"Look, I'm just-"
- I'm trying.
I'm trying really hard to be in her life.
"It's a little late for that, wouldn't you say?"
Have a good day.
Are you mad at me?
Just tell me.
Will you be on that all day long?
"""Yes."" Well, that sucks, because, you know, I thought you would want this, but..."
- Lame.
You don't even know what it is.
Do you really think a bribe's gonna work?
Yeah.
I'm hoping so.
"- We're both adults here, John."
"♪ Weaving the good life for you, sugar ♪"
♪ In every way ♪
[sighs]
"So, what can I do for you?"
"Well, I really need to talk to Topher in person."
- I called a bunch of times.
- Yeah.
He didn't know what it was about.
The hotel.
We had a deal.
- Did you?
- Yeah.
I got the good people of Venice to support the hotel development.
You remember.
"Come on, man."
You were there.
"And in exchange, Topher was gonna... well, I think I was gonna get a house."
[chuckles] A house?
Topher promised you a house?
"Well, not in so-- I know that that's what he meant."
"Look, all you did was... placate a community pressure group."
It was just PR.
[faint chiming]
You know what?
Why don't we just call it an even ten thou and we won't darken each other's doors again?
That's not gonna happen.
"Hey, I went to bat for you guys."
Okay?
I betrayed--
I upset a lot of good people who trusted me.
It's not right to do that and get nothing in return.
You owe me.
Are you all right?
Who did it?
This guy who lives across the street from me that I've known all my life.
He started to touch me.
He started to grab me... I told him to stop.
He didn't stop.
I hit him back.
And then he got really angry.
He pushed me out of the car.
You sure you're all right?
Huh?
Why don't you go inside and get yourself together.
Clean up.
"What do you want, fucko?"
"You want some, huh?"
"I swear on my fuckin' mother, if you touch her again, you're dead."
Don't shoot.
Hide this.
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
"I know there are women, like my best friends who would have gotten out of there the minute their boyfriend gave them a gun to hide."
But I didn't.
I got to admit the truth:
It turned me on.
Mazel tov!
Why don't you be like your friend Henry?
He's got a nice girl.
He's settling down now.
He's married.
Pretty soon he'll have a nice family.
And you're still bouncing around from girl to girl.
It was like he had two families.
You'll have to kill him.
Get my diamond before killing him.
I want that diamond at any cost.
Don't worry Bhai.
Have some opium and go to sleep.
I'm hearing a name that scary for the 1st time.
"Time is not good, let's go to the village."
We are in the village.
"Let's go to the city, Car is here."
I will kill him slowly.
Make a bomb.
Which blows.
"Laxminarayan will come, but he won't go back."
Listen to me carefully.
I've seen an old car on the internet.
"How is it, Sir?"
I want to buy this car.
Leave for Pondi now.
Check the car and give 1 lac as advance.
I will mail you the details.
"Which mail, Sir?"
"Sir, Today's Zapack mail comes very quick."
Fool.
I'll fax you from the computer turn on the fax machine.
"There are two fax machines here, which one, Sir."
Left or right?
Left.
Your left or my left?
My left.
"Which position are you in, Sir?"
Can't see on the phone.
This is your last chance.
May I help you?
I'd like to see the inmate Benigno Martin.
"This isn't a visitor's day, but let me see."
"I'm sorry, I can't hear you."
I'm sorry.
This isn't a visitor's day.
"and what's more, the intern hasn't requested a visit."
He doesn't know I'm in Madrid.
I arrived yesterday.
Are you a relative?
"No, I'm a friend."
My name is Marco Zuloaga.
"- May I see your ID, please?"
"- Yes, of course."
Can I phone him?
"You can't phone him, but he can phone you."
My number's changed.
Can you give him the new one?
- Of course.
- Thank you.
Great.
You should remember that visitor's days are Saturday and Sunday.
But it's the intern who has to request the visit.
"If he doesn't want to see you, we can't do anything."
He'll want to see me.
"By the way, we don't have inmates here, we have..."
I can't hear you.
I'm sorry.
"We don't have inmates here, we have interns."
"Good-bye, and thank you."
- 627...
- Wait.
What?
Am I wrong?
honestly?
I don't know.
Take a leak.
"This is bad, my friend."
"I mean, don't get me wrong."
I wouldn't piss on this ralph if he was on fire.
But to whack the guy over a horse?
How fucked up is that?
"If it can happen to him, it can happen to any of us."
What's next?
You get clipped for wearing the wrong shoes?
What can you do?
Tony's the boss.
Centuries of tradition here.
exactly my point.
If Tony did do this... whack ralph over a fucking horse... that guy would be the first guy on Iine to pull his fucking plug.
I think Justin recognized me a few minutes ago.
Thank you.
"Come in, he's getting dressed."
I'II wait in the car.
"well, welcome back."
I bring presents.
really?
That is so sweet.
"also, for the grownups, I bring some of my uncle's wine... but it's come later."
I just made some coffee.
Are you sure?
"Thank you, but I wait in the car."
What's the matter with you?
I'm sad for my father.
And all she wanted was for it to come true.
I bet she would still want it to come true.
She wouldn't want you to give that up.
I know. I just-- l don't think that I can do it without her.
What do you want ?
"Do you wanna do it, Sara ?"
I mean you.
Do you want Juilliard ?
- Yes.
- All right.
"Then, it's on you."
You're the one that's gonna have to make it happen.
You're the one that's gonna have to make the dream come true.
[KeysJingling]
"So, I'll see you tomorrow ?"
Yeah.
I promise not to have a nervous breakdown.
Good night.
Good night.
[Sara] I called Juilliard for an application.
They're holding auditions in Chicago next month.
[Derek] Next month.
That's cool.
"[Sara] I'm out of shape, and it hurts."
"If that's what you call out of shape, what does it take to get you in shape ?"
- Practice.
"- Okay, jog around the room, then."
Do some push-ups.
"I'll sit here, and I'm gonna watch."
That's not how I get into shape.
That's it.
Now shoulders down.
"""To each according to his needs""."
My poor little thing.
Is it love?
My cub...
Love.
I'll show you.
Mommy!
The smell is the proof.
You don't leave a friend wounded in the trenches of old age.
Especially when they're incontinent.
"Here I am, my friend."
"Come on, get down here, you prick."
Do you want me to snatch you by the balls?
Jump off!
And don't fidget!
"Do you remember when, you told me that"
I am doing all this for Mary.
You were right.
"Do you know what a ""lost girl"" means in French?"
Nobody knows any more.
It's a woman that keeps on walking until she falls apart.
You can never help her.
Ever.
You can try to kill yourself.
That's all.
"Yeah, I know."
"You could tell me that I could have nabbed the Munch Bunch at the parking lot, or the villa..."
I'm not God.
I'm just holding his crayon.
That's all.
"one more point, I'm not like the ones you've dealt with at home."
Come on.
"I mean, it was his flute that..."
You've the filthiest mouth!
"Ah, lay off, Kay, will you?"
I'm being harassed!
You just move!
"Look, do you want to keep it?"
What do you mean?
Do you want to...
He wants to know do you want an abortion?
I do not!
There's no way I'm having an abortion!
"Good, you're right!"
You definitely won't tell us who it is?
No!
Sorry.
"Well, there's no more to be said, is there?"
She's obviously made her mind up.
A man needs a pint after all that.
Hang on a second.
"Yes, love?"
Is that all?
What do you mean?
It's a terrible... the neighbors!
Do you care what the neighbors think?
"Yes, I do."
"Sure, the O'Neill young ones are after having kids."
The pair of them.
And the Bells would be the same... except they don't have any daughters... but you know what I mean.
Tara O'Neill had her baby for Paddy Bell.
Of course she did.
So fuck the neighbors.
"You coming for a drink, Sharon?"
I'll manage.
I told the cleaning lady to come twice a week too.
Absolutely not.
The way things were was fine.
It won't be the same.
What?
Dust?
I can dust.
I have to get the money from the account that Grandpa left.
We have to go to the bank.
Okay.
"Besides that, I'll arrange some more money."
I don't need you to arrange for me.
I need you to sign as a guarantor on the contract.
Did you notice that the bathroom light is flickering?
Yeah.
"It's like a discotheque, it needs to be checked."
I'll handle it.
Good.
Can I take this?
Of course.
You didn't forget anything?
I have everything.
You're sure?
- I'm sure.
"No, no, I'll take the dishes later."
Are you not feeling well?
"No, I'm fine."
Do you feel sick?
- It's nothing.
Want me to get you some glycerin?
"No, I don't need any."
Positive.
We'll walk home.
We almost died.
Yeah.
A-about what you said in the car...
Please don't make fun of me right now.
"No, I would never."
It was actually really honest.
And I need to stop taking shots at your intelligence.
You don't do it that often.
"Well, you miss a lot of it."
Oh.
"There, I did it again."
Did what?
"Uh, it doesn't matter."
"I always considered you to be this self-absorbed person, but you're more substantial than that, aren't you?"
Thank you.
You know what?
I'm blowing off Judo today.
Let's hang out.
What should we do?
Makeovers.
Okay.
Great!
We're gonna walk right past my waxing place.
Say goodbye to that gal stache.
Ow.
Ow!
"If it were easy, everyone would be hot."
"Yep, you know, I-it's not just my feet."
It's from when I walked into the stop sign because you wouldn't give me back my...
"Okay, fine."
You wouldn't listen!
I told you to tell him!
Keep your pants on!
"All right, boys, break it up!"
"The other eye, Nelson!"
Close the other eye!
"Ten seconds, Stoke!"
Get in your shell!
Cover up!
Cover up!
"Break it up, break it up!"
Go to your corners!
"Break it up, the bell rang!"
- What's got into him?
- He's got to make it look good!
"Yeah, yeah!"
"But we finish him the next heat, don't we?"
"Yeah, the next heat!"
"Here you are, get your fresh-roasted peanuts!"
"Get all the peanuts you need right now, folks!"
There's not many left!
"I told you to get in a shell, didn't I?"
You see his face when I gave him that right?
- He'll murder you now!
"Won't he, Tiny?"
- Red's got something!
- What do you mean?
- Play it smart!
"Keep away from him, and you'll go the distance!"
My only chance is to deck him!
It's better to go the distance than get your head knocked off!
Get your cold beer here!
No it's cool.
What's going on?
"Well, um, Nathan's talking about quitting the team."
"And I just, I don't know what to say."
"Yeah, look I could never find the words to get through that big wall that he puts up so I really can't help you out much."
But you're so much better with him than I ever was.
He's lucky to have you.
Thanks.
I don't want to keep you from your practice.
Hmm.
Go Ravens.
"Hey, um, I didn't mean anything, about your mom."
It's cool.
Okay.
You could have told me Travis was a group.
It's not like it's some big secret.
Lucas gave me the weirdest look when I said that.
I felt so stupid.
You're not stupid.
You guys just don't like the same things.
"See, that's the problem."
He brings up art and books and I've got nothing.
- Hey you.
- Hey you.
And you.
"Welcome back, gentlemen."
Lets see how soft you all got after that little hiatus.
Suicides.
Now.
"Better be a basketball in that thing, Jagielski."
"Come on, Coach."
It's either this or I miss practice.
It isn't rare to find destructive even criminal behavior.
"Hey, do me a favor, will you?"
Tell me something good.
Don't be alarmed.
"If it's a lesion, in a way, she's fortunate."
All we have to do is remove the scar.
-Let's move her.
"- Regan, can you sit up, scoot over?"
A little more.
Good.
"Regan, I'm just gonna move you down on the table, okay?"
Let me do this.
It's okay.
See?
There we go.
It's just for a short time.
You're doing fine.
Very sticky.
Good.
"Now, Regan, you're gonna feel something a little bit cold and wet."
Okay.
Now you're gonna feel a little stick here.
Don't move.
Good.
Okay.
You're gonna feel some pressure here.
"Now, don't move."
Hook up.
There's nothing there.
No vascular displacement at all.
Do you want me to run another series?
I don't think so.
I'm in jail.
I can't stop people from coming to see me.
Let her sneak this stuff in for you every week.
Let her fight these bastards every week!
Look what you're doing!
Stop it!
I'm sorry.
Let her sneak this shit in for you.
Will you stop it?
-Let her do it!
-Stop it!
Nobody's helping me. I am all alone.
Belle and Morrie are broke.
I asked your friend Remo for the money he owes you.
He told me to take the kids down to the police station and get on welfare.
"Karen, lt's going to be okay."
I've never seen Paulie since he got out.
I never see anyone.
That's what happens when you go away.
We're on our own.
Forget everybody else.
Forget Paulie.
As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
-l can't do it.
"-Yes, you can."
All I need is for you is to keep bringing me this stuff.
I gotta guy in here from Pittsburgh who's gonna help me move it.
In a month we're gonna be fine.
We won't need anybody.
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid if Paulie finds out....
He is not helping us out.
I'll go up the hill.
"If we're cut off, call me back."
I can't call you.
Hello.
"Are you well, Mrs Godarzi?"
"Sorry, it takes a few minutes to reach the high ground."
You can't foresee that.
"One day she's well, the next she isn't."
Her condition varies.
We're all waiting.
We have to wait.
She has company.
Her son has come a long way.
He's waiting like us.
When will we be back?
In a couple of days maybe.
Good-bye.
I knew that warm voice belonged to a warm-hearted man.
Hello.
How are you?
It's deep!
"Three metres, as stated in the contract with the engineer."
I think you may be right.
Working alone is better.
It's harder... but there are advantages.
- Do you understand me?
- No.
I mean that no one bothers you.
A boss.
You don't have a boss.
Yeah?
He comes and disturbs us.
"Oh, great."
Perfect turns on every track I've ever raced on.
"Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself a quart of oil at Flo's."
I'll keep an eye on him.
"Well, thanks, Doc."
I've been feelin' a quart low.
"This ain't asphalt, son."
This is dirt.
"Oh, great."
What do you want?
You here to gloat?
"You don't have three-wheel brakes, so you got to pitch it hard, break it loose and then just drive it with the throttle."
"Give it too much, you'll be outta the dirt and into the tulips."
"So you're a judge, a doctor and a racing expert."
I'll put it simple.
"If you're goin' hard enough left, you'll find yourself turning' right."
Oh...
Right.
That makes perfect sense.
Turn right to go left!
Yes!
Thank you!
"Or should I say, ""No, thank you""?"
"Because in Opposite World, maybe that really means, ""Thank you""!"
Crazy grandpa car.
What an idiot!
Turn right to go left.
Hmm...
Whoa!
Oh!
Ow!
"Oh, that..."
The stuff you can't see.
I've known Walter my whole life.
God!
He's a decent man.
- He's a good man.
- But this is tough stuff.
This is body bag stuff.
Tell me if there's some other way.
There's isn't.
Die's been cast.
It was cast a long time ago.
Go easy.
Give him a blindfold and have mercy.
"Walter Stern was a tough man, but he was fair."
We give back the same.
No?
And you be careful.
Keep George with you.
Let him drive.
I got to go in here.
I knew James Wakeley would surface just as I knew when that bullet hit that boy it would keep traveling.
And find its way...
To me.
If only it had found me first.
It is not the way of a lust people !
"How could you lie to me, you butcher !"
How could you make me love you ?
I did not give you permission to leave !
She doesn't need anyone's permission.
Let her go !
Enough of this childishness !
Throw them in the slave pits !
"- Couldn't lend us a ten-spot, could you?"
"- Yeah, course, our kid."
"Cheers, bro."
"- Nicely, nicely!"
- That's a bit of a relief.
Bit of a relief?
Bit of a relief?
I feel like I've just done a dump the size of a man's head.
Troy?
"Look, about that tenner."
There's... no rush for paying' us back.
As long as it's within one calendar month.
"- Moz, I know we've never been close..."
"- No, we hate each other."
"- No, we don't."
"- We do, don't we?"
We might.
"Look, I don't want to see you get hurt."
You can't always trust your friends.
- Aye aye!
- Or the law.
"Yeah, well, sayonara, Señor Paranoia!"
"All right, filth?"
Still got that tattoo of a Dalek on your arse?
"I can't stay long, Moz."
I'm mounted.
"What, you left Shergar outside?"
You'd best leave.
The kids round here'll melt him down for glue.
"Right, then, Moz, we'll be off..."
"Right, then."
"See you, lads."
Phew.
"Listen, O'Leary, I know we're up against it time-wise, but, er..."
"Yeah, big time."
"We've got like, we've got to save Simon."
"Dermot, give me a second."
There's a bit of a big deal happening.
Right.
"Sid Lowecroft is leaving, um, this is a little present for his daughter."
"Oh, OK."
Put this on.
But he doesn't know who I am.
"That's what the whole kick is, he'll get a kick out of the new guy."
"He won't get a kick out of it, he'll go, ""Who are you?"
"""Why are you gate-crashing my last day?"""
"No, he won't, as soon as he walks in, blow that."
"Then give him the doll, read out the letter."
Yeah.
It's some kind words that I've written down for him.
OK.
And then let one of these bad boys off.
"Doll, letter, boom."
Bingo.
I'm going to go and get the cake.
Let him know that we're ready.
You're not in this with me?
"No, no, no, no, I'm just going to go and get a cake."
"Right, hide under there when he comes in."
Right.
Are you ready for this?
Under there?
"Yeah, under there."
Under there.
The film that we might work on together is actually sort of about that.
You're gonna work with Jim Jarmusch?
I don't want to go to a bar on Smith street.
Let's just go back to my place.
"I live with my dad, but he'll be out tonight."
- We can have a drink there.
- What year are you again at N.Y.U?
- Senior.
- Senior?
Okay.
"Wait, so you're 22, right?"
I'm going to be soon.
I'm 21.
"You don't think i'm too old, do you?"
I'm 30.
30 is cool.
I've been with guys older than you.
But are you a man or a boy?
"Well, what's the difference?"
With a man... you feel like you're being taken and you like it.
And with a boy you feel like they're stealing something from you and you don't like it.
This is it.
Thank you.
"Shit, my dad is home already."
We can go to seventh avenue and grab a drink.
We're going in his office.
It's fun in there.
It's a beautiful brownstone.
- Your dad's a therapist?
"- Yeah, he's a pain in the ass."
He thinks he's the Carl Jung of Brooklyn.
I like Carl Jung.
"Oh, my goodness."
Look at that power.
'The training had paid off.'
Well done!
Look at the speed of this man.
'Sort of...'
"Oh, mate!"
"Are you all right, mate?"
Talk us through it again.
Which one was a professional boxer(?
)
I was in the blue on the floor.
You were in the blue?
Looking ripped.
Yeah.
I look like somebody's made a human out of mashed potato.
JIMMY GUFFAWS
APPLAUSE
I would pay?
40 to see you fight Vladimir Klitschko.
I'd love to see that.
Yeah.
"He didn't like me when we met, either."
Why?
"Ah, I kept on, I said to him, ""If you win..."""
"He went, ""I will win."" I went on, ""If you win..."""
"""I will win."" Then I went,"
"""Isn't there any part of your head telling you you might not?"
"""How are you being that positive?"""
"And he went, ""Don't ask a fighter"
"""a question he can't answer with words."""
"And I tell you, I was that close."
Wait!
These are only lemon sharks!
This is all part of the course.
It is like life.
Like in relationships.
They will not attack unless they feel attacked!
"Marcel, I need you to take the French out of your mouth and tell me what to do!"
Don't let them see your fear.
"Okay, I think we just hold tight, we play it cool, we don't make a move."
What was that?
What?
What was that?
"Jason, stop..."
He said not to panic!
He said not to panic!
I'm sitting in blood!
I'm sitting in blood!
"Marcel, this isn't a drill, buddy!"
You got real sharks here!
It's time to get the guns' and it's time to shoot some fish!
"Here on Eden, there are no guns!"
You got an American life at stake.
One life is not more important than another.
What do I do?
My friends and my wife left me to die.
"You must get out of the chum, but slowly."
Okay.
Swim slowly out of the chum!
Slowly.
Slowly.
"Yes, yes."
"Slowly, baby!"
Who are you?
I know what you're doing in this village.
I saw that room.
And I know what the fuck you're doing to my daughter!
"I want you... to stop what you're doing, and leave this village quietly."
I mean it.
Leave.
Quietly.
This is Gokseong.
My turf.
Don't mess around and get yourself killed.
Just leave.
"If you don't leave, you'll die."
"If you heard me, say something."
Or at least nod your fucking head!
Please answer.
"So, you're..."
"Shut up, bitch!"
You're blowing me off?
"Oh, I'm just not worth answering."
Is that it?
"You're not even gonna listen, right?"
Ain't that right?
"I'm trying to speak to you, but you're not listening!"
What's this?
What the fuck is this?
What the hell is all this?
What the...
What the fuck are these rituals you're doing?
!
What the fuck are you doing in my town!
Do you know whose daughter you're messing with?
Let's get her on the phone.
I'll tell her myself.
You leave my wife out of this.
You dragged her into it when you broke the law with your boss.
"You pay, she pays."
Hmm.
He's about to fold.
And admit what?
"If I had my way, damn near everything."
This guy washes stark's underwear.
He knows.
"Hey, it's just getting good."
I should get back to my station.
I'm sure the last thing you want is to put anna on a plane
And have to explain why.
"All right, I'll let you take my shift."
"It's a one-time offer, carter."
Carter!
"Excuse me, chief dooley."
"I need your signature, sir."
What?
Can't it wait?
I'm afraid the codes are ready for analysis.
I need your approval.
Thank you.
Why don't you sit here awhile?
Think about it.
I'm gonna get a coffee.
You want something?
That's my cue.
What do you think?
I think he's on the verge of telling you
"They're cops,jody."
What is she doing here?
I called her.
She should know what's going on.
"Well,it's coming out of your profits,bob."
"Wait a minute,jody."
That sisal's expensive.
"You need to calm down,mrs.Carvell."
Calm down?
I just found a dead guy in the living room and I am losing money every day.
"Ohand my father just died of leukemia, so don't you tell me to calm down."
"I'm thinking before we open this up, maybe we should rub some vick's under our noses."
I don't think we'll find a body.
Hope not.
Hate that.
Nothing?
"Well,whatever lance corporal finn was planning on putting in here, he didn't get a chance to."
"Mcgee,give me your flashlight."
You didn't bring your own?
It's too heavy.It pulls my pants down.
Now close the door.
To the right.To the right.
Yeah.
"Just,more to the left.More to the left."
-Okay.
"-Okay,hold it."
Yeah.
too small to hold a body.
Big enough to hold a head.
Is that what I think it is?
"Oh,yes."
Gold.
She's not feeling that well.
"Aw, no."
I'm sorry.
"No, it's nothing serious."
"I just haven't seen her in a while, so..."
I thought that...
My mom is not sick.
She's not sick.
Okay.
Where you going?
Away.
With a man I met from EST.
"What do you mean, ""Away""?"
Away.
I don't know.
"Uh, for a few days."
"We've, um... had this emotional connection for some time, and we just want to see if there is something else there."
You're telling me you're going to have an affair?
Sandra?
I might.
I don't know.
At least I'm being honest.
Go ahead.
Tell me that you're not having an affair.
I'm --
You know what kills me about the whole thing?
"Is that you didn't have any idea anything was going on -- you, Mr. Counterintelligence Genius."
You just didn't see it?
So you either didn't want to know or you didn't care enough to pay attention.
Who is he?
"Oh, it doesn't matter, really."
"- Who is he, Sandra?"
"I tried to give it to my daughter, but she... threw it back at me."
I think you're about her size.
Could you try it on?
I'll wait in the other room.
Got the bullets.
You'll be surprised how many places I...
What's goin' on?
How do I look?
Ok.
Where did you get it?
He gave it to me.
What for?
"I don't know, Vi."
Can I talk to you a minute?
Have you lost your mind?
- What's your problem?
- You're my problem!
I'll let you borrow it some time if that's what this is about.
It's not about the fucking dress!
"- Yea, right."
- That's exactly right!
"You don't run me, Violet!"
We don't know anybody.
or get involved in stuff or anything like that.
I never went to a prom.
"You did, but I didn't."
- Be glad you didn't!
- Why?
- Because they would laugh at you!
- How do you know?
Because that's what they do if you're different.
"Everybody isn't like that, Vi."
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Was I too loud?
"No, that wasn't bad at all."
Thank you.

For what?
"You moved on, started a family."
It wasn't that easy for the rest of us.
"Look, Ted, I can't make up for not being around, okay?"
But I'm here now.
It's too late for that.
"I'm done with you, like you were done with all of us."
(crickets chirping)
It's very late.
I didn't hear you come in.
"Well, I wanted to let you sleep."
It didn't go well with the men?
These guys saw hell.
"You know, most of them are still paying the price."
"You feel the effects of war, too, Booth."
Yeah.
"Yeah, but I got lucky."
I got a great family and great life.
Got all this.
"You're an addict, just like Aldo."
Yeah.
"Unlike him, you got help."
Yeah.
But you're in my corner.
That's the difference.
Aldo had no one.
(beeping)
Hey.
"I just, uh, dropped off Jessica."
"And, let me guess, you thought you might check in to see what I'm getting from Tompkins' video doorbell."
Looks like it's rough going.
I thought those things actually worked.
I can't tell.
Uh...
Who is this?
We're her friends.
Do you have a problem with that?
"Yeah, I have a problem with that."
And I have a problem with you looking at me like that.
Who are you to look at me like that?
I don't like him.
Let's go.
Me neither.
Who are you to look at me like that.
"Come on, Kathy."
Bye.
Wait.
I can't.
"Friends are really hard to get, especially when you're pregnant."
I'll talk to you later.
Isn't it harder to get a boyfriend when you're pregnant?
(ALL GIGGLING)
Ben just wants to see his girl.
Ben needs some happiness in his life.
He deserves it.
"I don't feel like letting him pretend to date me, okay?"
I don't like that.
That would be using me to do something that I don't even think he should do.
And Ben's my friend.
He shouldn't ask me to do something I don't want to do.
I've got the harder part.
I have to go over and convince Dylan's parents to let her go out with me.
But I think I'm up to the challenge.
It could be fun.
I don't.
I don't care if we fail.
Failing's fine!
"If we go down in flames, at least there were flames!"
Wow.
"If we're gonna do this, I want to do TV that's bold and thrilling and dangerous!"
I can be dangerous.
I-I can.
You don't seem dangerous.
That's what makes me so dangerous.
I like you.
"I like you, too."
I think you are so much more than you've been allowed to be.
Really?
You need to stop trying to please people.
Can you do that?
If that's what you want.
I don't think she's coming back.
Amazing.
She gave you another chance?
You are an evil genius.
You're too kind.
And you're okay with her getting married again?
Yeah.
Why not?
Your ex-wife ever remarry?
No.
I like to think she exhausted all her misery on me and then left the business.
So I'm guessing you don't miss her.
No.
I do miss my current wife.
"Yeah, you guys are idiots."
"Oi, don't start."
"Mom, you're the one who wanted us here."
"Listen, you're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all."
What kind of people are these?
-What do you want me to do?
-Do?
What can you do?
He's not Jewish.
Did you know how these people live?
Did you know what they were like?
Your father never stayed out all night without calling.
Stay out?
"Daddy never went out at all, Ma!"
Keep out of it!
You don't know how I feel!
How do you feel now?
You don't know where he is or who he's with!
He's with his friends!
Dad!
Will you leave him out of this?
He's suffered enough.
The man hasn't been able to digest a decent meal in six weeks.
Where were you?
Why didn't you call?
We were worried to death!
A married man does not stay out like this!
Normal people don't act like this!
What's wrong with you?
You're not normal.
She's right!
"What's wrong with you, Henry?"
What kind of person are you?
You've had your wishes.
"Now, it's my turn."
And now I'll know when they're coming for me.
"And if I can see them,"
I can kill them.
I bet you didn't see that coming.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I had to use the Tesla.
He's dead.
You killed him.
"- Pete, what's going on?"
- Change of plans.
"What do you think, I'm an idiot?"
Don't answer that.
"Look, just stop, okay?"
Just put down the gun and let's think this through.
- I'm still taking the artifact.
- I can't let you do that.
"Die trying to stop me, Alice."
"Oh, clever boy."
What tipped you?
The real Myka... would never kiss me.
Never!
Not if her life depended on it.
- Which is...
- A shame.
You're a good kisser.
- So Artie hasn't figured this out yet.
"- Well, not yet."
"But when he does, he'll set the real Myka free, and you will... poof... disappear."
"It doesn't work that way, Pete."
Then you bring me here?
How can i left you there?
Laxmi Narayan.
Now pain is gone?
Pain has just started.
What is she doing!
Why are you taking off your cloths?
How can i show you then?
No... no!
This is wrong... now i got your nature.
And you know my nature.
Laxmi Jee Relax... that's what happen in this age.
I am sorry... why?
Because of the way talked to you.
When?
When i told you to shoot me.
What was you fault...
I am not like that.
"If i didn't had problem, i would never say like that."
After my father left.
I am all alone.
Have to leave this house too.
"You know, that Mundaya was saying... if i don't pay him the money, i have to marry him."
"Better is that, i should kill myself i will kill you... if you talk like this."
"I am here, here it is, how much you need?"
I bought 25000/- only 25000/-?
"Don't worry... take this chain, worth 24000/- only?"
"Only means, its fake."
Take this ring.
It was for my just wife.
Just wife?
Yeah i just told Mina gay my wife.
"Well, it ain't my fault, is it?"
"If you're worrying about that dame, I'll call her up."
No cracks.
I don't want her to know anything about this or me.
"Yeah, I see."
- Get back to that hospital and find out--
"- Jeez, I've been sleeping in the halls."
Get out of here.
Get back to that hospital.
Stay with him.
Get in bed with him.
- Back.
Move it on those two sides.
- Stay in line.
Move it faster.
Come on.
"Come on, get in here."
Come on.
"Come on, boys, hurry up."
"- Mr. Thompson, look at that."
"- Well, what's the matter with it?"
- Can you eat it?
Those boys can't.
"- Well, they don't have to."
It's worse now than it ever was.
"Miss Griffith, kindly understand that I want no more interference in things that don't concern you."
This does concern me.
We started something.
It was successful.
"Every day, bit by bit, you're tearing it down."
- That will do.
"- No, it won't."
He was in for sex crimes.
Just got released two weeks ago.
Thanks.
Hello.
How are you holding up?
Fantastic.
What's a five-letter word for a cooking utensil?
A whisk?
That would be it.
We're all rooting for you.
I want you to know that.
Thank you.
I appreciate that.
You here to see Johnny Holt?
"Yes, I am."
We found his blood on Vince Nelson's throat.
Holt's a bad dude.
"If he gives you any problems, let me know."
I'll get in there and beat him up for you.
Whisk.
I knew that.
Never seen him before.
There's traces of your blood on him.
My blood's all over this city.
"Been shot nine times, knifed five."
We believe the victim was involved in child pornography.
Do you recognize this boy?
You implying I'm into kids?
Because I sure as hell don't fly that way.
Right.
"Right, you prefer to rape grown women. forgot."
They said it was rape.
"Come on, what are you going to do all by yourself in this gutter?"
"With me, you have a chance!"
You can all rot with her!
"This stare, not for me."
I've got to see Him!
Now I can't see a thing.
Now you can see for real.
"At the end of a regularfilm, I'd go on a killing spree too."
I'd be the hero.
But there are no more heroes.
Just the humiliated.
Stop your bullshit.
Let's walk out of here... barefoot.
"Made off, the rats, welfare!"
"This is the end, my only friend."
I won't have the lake.
There won't be any real revolution.
From now on don't budge!
Hear me?
Watch him.
Save me.
Take me.
Any place you want.
"This film was inspired by ""The Idiot"" by Fedor Dostoevsky."
It is intended as a homage to this great writer.
English Translation:
Daniel Bird and Andrzej Zulawski.
"Morena, get up on the dam."
I want you to deal with the radio room.
Come on!
José should be ready by now.
- I think it's strange.
Do you know how weird that makes me feel?
"A lesbian dream, and he's staring at me like I should include him."
I can't even fantasize in private.
Mom said you've been seeing someone steady.
Is he cute?
- What?
- What are you doing here?
I thought I'd meet you for coffee.
Is that a terrible thing to do?
Excuse me.
I'm going to the ladies' room.
Alone.
Can you believe this weather?
"It's almost April, and it's still cold."
I'm glad I have you alone.
Can I ask you a question?
"It'll sound strange, but..."
Is Claire happy?
"I mean, do you think she's happy?"
"Yes, I think she is."
Why?
I'm being silly.
"I'm a first-time husband, I guess."
"If she doesn't wake up and tell me she's ecstatic, I worry."
"Imagine, I have you to thank for the fact that we're married."
You made this possible.
Knowing you has changed my life.
- Don't do that.
- What?
What am I doing?
"You don't even know, do you?"
Aren't you hungry?
I want to eat something yummy.
Will you treat me?
"Sure, what do you want?"
Something really tasty.
Like spicy rice cakes.
Spicy rice cakes?
Spicy rice cakes?
Don't know if they have it here.
Don't think so.
Do they sell rice cakes here?
"If they do, I can cook it myself."
I'm really good at it.
Really?
Let's check out the grocery store.
Don't go out of your way.
"Don't worry, stupid."
Let's go down to that sand dune.
There's something real neat.
What is it?
I'll show you.
What is it?
"You see, I got the splinter out."
"I didn't get it out myself, and didn't know when it happened."
But I think it was when I bowed on my knees.
You went down on your knees?
"Yeah, I think that's when the splinter got out."
Why did you bow?
Come on and see.
"You'll feel like doing it, too."
Why are you laughing?
"Alright, let's go."
So j... give me your skates.
What?
Why?
"You've dragged me so far, we're closer to my office than we are to the car."
Take 'em off!
He just wasn't ready.
But me?
I had a message for the small stuff that used to rule my life.
"Hey, Phil."
"Honey, how you holding up?"
Good.
"So, I'm at the beach..."
Long story.
"Anyway, I was hoping you wouldn't mind waiting at the house for Luke's tutor."
"Actually, I would mind."
I'd mind quite a bit.
I'm kind of busy.
"Okay, great."
"Suck it, small stuff."
Why are we stopping?
"For many, a near-miss with death is a wake-up call."
"But when a man misses his own near-miss, he truly sees what he's been missing."
No more putting my dreams on hold.
"Five years ago, I made a bucket list."
It was time to start crossing things off.
Scariest moment of my life.
Ohh.
"Oh, my gosh."
I thought I lost you!
"But amazingly, something great came out of it."
I found out how my sister truly feels about me.
"Girls, are you sure?"
"I think about my father, about my mother."
I'm searching in the mud.
- Don't you want to look at me?
- It's difficult.
Tough day?
Was it easier with the gangster's woman?
It was just a reflex.
She loved me.
So one has to be in love to reflect?
It's better for the other one.
- The neighbor?
- Up above.
Do you mean God?
Could it be just the two of us for two minutes?
It'd be too sad.
"But everything's sad, open your eyes!"
I can't see.
"I can see into, but not..."
"And how am I, into?"
Young.
Would you like to visit?
"I can be just as cheap a tart as your tramp, you know!"
No you can't.
You enjoy that?
"You really are fucked up, friend of a friend!"
It's André!
"André, meet my friend of a friend, Léo."
André is a man on the move.
"He's moving in Mom, who's moving him up."
"Forget sweet talk, when it comes to whoring, I'm his bet."
"""But once in America, what will we do?"
"""Monsieur de la Fayette will provide you with instructions!"""
I wanna hear what she has to say.
"Bloody Mary, shadows have power, I get it."
But what if that's not just a shadow?
That look on her face is somebody who's trapped.
"Believe me, I know that look and so do you."
"If things get hinky, you can pull the plug."
What do you got to lose?
I do need to do this.
"Wait, wait!"
Let me think!
Where are you?
So Mr. Whitman doesn't look good.
- No sign of any artifact.
- Not even a glimmer.
- What's up with his hand?
- I don't know.
"If you want to get rest, I'll stay with them."
- Not if they split up.
- I'll call you.
"No, no."
Let's...
Let's stay together.
"If they've got something, it's on 'em."
I want to know what it is.
I've been burned by this before.
They look real and they'll say anything.
Say something.
"Artie, when I get out of here, I'm hugging her and"
I'm kicking your ass.
"Yeah, well, that won't be happening."
Why?
"- Artie, it's me."
And why things happen this way and not the other.
I think there's no much use in talking about what happened already.
Probably...
You're always trying to explain people what happens to them.
Instead of looking to yourself.
"Once, I was thinking of you.."
And then I got sad.
Then I'm not funny always.
You never put any effort in a better living.
"For example, you say you like living in the field."
Then why don't you move here?
Would you come with me?
Why do you say that?
I'm saying if you'd live here with me.
I don't know.
I told you I may not like the idea.
What does that mean to what we were talking?
Do you love me Sara?
And what did that come from?
I'm asking you.
How I couldn't love you.
You're my father!
And if I weren't?
Imagine for a moment that I weren't.
What a nonsense!
What do I know?
Could you give me a cigarette?
I'm going to bed.
We had a long ride.
Good night.
Bye.
Good night.
"Dale, Baby."
What you do here?
Wow let me guess...
Baby's mama?
Did you just call me a baby?
Baby she didn't just call me a baby now did she?
What?
Don't screw with me slut!
Excuse me?
You don't know her do you JP?
Yeah baby.
This is Dale.
Not anymore you don't.
Bye bye.
This is my first bitch slap but seeing the look on her Botoxed face.
You deserve him!
"Totally makes it worth it,"
I like!
And he's going to put me in his next movie.
But isn't he kind of old?
Aren't you going to have to you know...
Do him?
Probably.
Oh God!
If I have to stand here and listen to this bimbo yap about the blowjob she'll have to give to get a movie part.
I'll pee in my pants.
Um excuse me...
We're in line.
"Um, actually you're at the mirror which doesn't really constitute the line."
Well just go... fine.
I'll give you my number and then you know maybe we can hang out sometime?
You gonna give me your number?
A flower van.
You know what you should do is a garbage truck.
"Seriously, and I don't mean to disrespect but if you put cops in the back of a garbage truck there's no way I'm seriously thinking that there's cops in the back of a garbage truck."
"It's a freebie, yo."
Just think about it.
"Think about it, boys."
All right.
I'm hitting it.
You dudes give up that easy?
I'm not a cop.
Then lift your shirt.
Show me you're not wearing a wire.
"All right, you know what?"
Just to show you you're being an asshole.
I'm blinded by white.
Douchebag.
Come on.
I was joking.
Come on.
Don't walk away angry.
Sit down.
Come on.
"I mean, what are you complaining about?"
"You got abs, man."
Kind of.
"Whatever, dude."
I'm not even sure I wanna buy anymore.
I think you turned me off to the whole thing.
Come on.
Don't be like that.
"I just need you to prove it, you know?"
Prove you're not a cop.
Now.
"I can't, sweetheart, we've got a plane to catch."
"Oh, every time we're close, I feel something good is about to happen."
You've got to be...
You said you didn't want to see my face or hear my voice.
I can't think in there.
"Well, it wasn't my voice."
I thought you'd keep him in check.
I thought I could depend on you.
"- Well, Cari told Bob..."
- That she's going to Brazil...
Please.
"Jon, please."
I'm two cases short.
What?
You gotta be kidding.
You know that baby food was on the way to the lab.
It was contaminated with botulism.
I know.
I probably lost them when I got this.
I gotta make a phone call.
Four were crouched behind their car.
"It was just me and my bike against four men, two. 45s and two sawed-offs."
"I pulled my gun, grabbed my mike and called for backup."
Then they opened fire.
I was hit by a bullet.
"Oh, I hurt real bad."
I went down.
I got up and I got hit on this side...
"Oh, you girls..."
I was speaking very low.
Baker.
What do you say?
Sit down.
"- How they treating you, Rocky?"
- Like a prince.
I get three square meals and real butter on my bread.
What a life.
- Is that a bad cut on your eye?
- Not bad.
Just a few stitches.
I thought you knocked your eye out.
You coming to my trial tomorrow?
"Rocky, I've been worrying about this all last night."
- I can't let you take the whole blame.
"- Pipe down, want the flapper to hear?"
Now get this.
"You got away, didn't you?"
Okay.
I wanna be a sucker.
"But, Rocky, maybe if they thought I was in on it, they'd go easier on you."
In a pig's eye.
"Just because you can run faster, you don't gotta eat yourself."
"- But it ain't fair to you, Rocky."
"- Look, so they send me up."
So what?
What've I got to lose?
The old man's got troubles enough without me.
Forget it.
"I got caught, and you got away."
"But you, Rocky."
"Supposing I was the one who got caught, you wouldn't keep quiet."
- You'd make them send you up too.
- What do you think I am?
Oh my God.
"You covered ""how will I know"""
And you dedicated it to me
And I sat there trying not to laugh.
Oh God.
I was so in love with you.
What are we doing?
Things were so much easier when we were younger.
Unlike our kids we just jumped into things.
"I mean, why can't we just be more like that"
Just figure it out as we go along?
Maybe this didn't turn out to be
The romance we thought it would be when we first met.
Well.
It's more like choose your own adventure.
Maybe it just wasn't the right time.
Maybe it never will be.
What if it is?
What if we're just too stubborn to see it?
I don't want to miss out.
Well...
Neither do I.
I don't have a ring
So this will have to do.
Rufus.
What are you doing?
"Marry me, Lily."
Marry me.
I know that'll make me your... uh your fifth husband.
So?
Yes.
Give me your hand.
What's this?
I'm the Boss after all.
I always carry my portable lobby along.
Sit.
Where do I sit?
Here.
Don't sit there you fool.
It'll crack the eggs.
So there are eggs inside?
No.
There are nails.
They'll pierce through.
Yes Mr. Thakur.
How can I be of service?
Are you going to kill Shiv in jail?
Why are you being so eager Thakur?
I know all about you.
First you clear the garbage and then your record.
Thakur.
If kill him in your jail... won't there be an investigation on you?
The media's been showing your footage with that boy... and boring you to death.
If kill him won't you be blamed?
He's right.
Then what do we do?
It's simple.
We won't kill Shiv in jail.
We'll get him out first and then...
Superb.
Let him escape.
What do you say Ayushman?
Let's make him flee from jail.
Stupid fool.
Is the bar open?
I mean can I get a decent cup of coffee?
Now that's a classic portrait.
What do you think Angie?
I'm not a fan of black and white photos.
I had a black and white photo taken of me as well.
I looked really great.
"Just fabulous, like a film star."
But I don't look like that at all.
Exactly.
That's why I like black and white photos.
So you lie to yourself quite a bit.
Right?
I think you are beautiful.
- Hi.
"Angie, clean up back there!"
"One thing after another, boss."
"This one is good too, by the way."
"Right, quite good."
"Okay, I'll take that."
You want to buy me a drink?
Why not?
Thank you for the sign.
Now go to your brother and pull the money off the wall.
Go fuck yourself Toni.
"You could stay outside as well, or sit in the lobby and drink tap water."
- Can we get a coffee here?
Sure.
Two coffees?
- Black.
Me too.
Thank you.
"All right, y'all, it's almost time for the mele, the Kanikapila luau drum show!"
The special blend.
"Yes, this is a magical drink."
You know what?
I'm gonna go get a good spot for the show.
Do you guys wanna come?
"No, no, we're good here."
Okay.
You're fine?
Okay.
And then there was two.
"Listen, I want you to come back with me."
I'm not going back to the other side with you.
"I'm gonna stay right here, get my celebration on and get another margarita made up in my face."
I came a long way to find you.
"Well, I know you ain't come to get a drink."
You damn sure ain't come to dance.
So what'd you follow me here for?
No.
I did.
"I came here to drink, party, scratch records, do it all!"
Do it...
It's just...
Just...
Just...
You know?
What am I saying?
I don't want to do any of those things.
Truth is that I'm exhausted just saying them.
"All right, y'all, it's time for the Kanikapila luau drum show!"
"Cynthia, hi."
Excuse me.
Just pass me the bill.
Okay!
Sir Wong is looking for you.
What's wrong with you?
You used my money to solve a kidnap case.
You saved the guy but my money is gone.
Now my money is strewn all over the streets.
Isn't that too much?
Capturing the baddies at all cost.
"Bro, you think I'm the richest man in HK?"
"I'm not your bro, Mr. Mak."
I'm your son.
Are there other cops like you?
Using money to work?
You're too busy to spend your money.
Treat it as a good cause.
You think I'm a charity?
Fine...
You only call when I spend your money.
Meet and scold me in person.
Isn't that more satisfying?
I'm always free to meet you.
I never wanted you to be a cop.
"I warn you, I'll freeze your account."
Excuse me...
Where's the resource room?
You can't buy style.
Shit!
We've the same tie!
"I asked for resource room, not fashion advice."
"No resource room, evidence room is ahead."
Thank you.
"Yeah, I know."
He's in the city on important business.
- He'll be back soon.
- Uh-huh.
That's what you think.
Everybody says he quit us for something better.
- That's a lie.
- What did he hang it on a limb for?
He didn't run out on us.
I'll beat up any guy that says he did.
"Well, I was only telling you what everybody's saying."
What's the matter?
Don't you like it?
Stinks.
"What's the difference, if it's a nice room?"
"Besides, you're only gonna be here a little while."
- Get down to that hospital.
Go ahead.
- I'll keep calling you.
Get that mug anything.
I don't want him to die on me.
What's the matter?
Just when I get everything set up at school.
I have to knock off that gorilla.
Don't tell me you're worrying about that joint?
Yeah.
Go on.
Get down to the hospital.
- Go ahead.
Beat it.
Go ahead.
"- Okay, okay."
All I know is how to sit down and order a meal.
Not for you.
Just a place to hang.
The chef is great.
The fuckin'shows are good.
There's a lot of whores coming in.
What do you want from me?
Tommy's a bad seed.
What am I supposed to do?
Shoot him?
That wouldn't be a bad idea.
I'm sorry I said that. I didn't mean to say that.
I just mean that he's scaring me.
I just need help.
"Help me, please."
You know anything about this fuckin' restaurant business?
He knows everything about it.
He's in the joint 24 hours a day.
"Another fucking few minutes, he could be a stool."
That's how often he's in there.
You want me to be your partner?
is that what you're tryin' to tell me?
You want me to be partners?
What do you think I'm talking about?
"Paulie, please."
It's not even fair.
You don't understand.
You run the joint.
Maybe I'll try to help you.
"God bless you, Paulie."
You've always been fair with me.
Now the guy's got Paulie as a partner.
"-Yeah, right."
-What?
-Joey cracks me up.
"""Have your ex-wife move in."
"That wouldn't be awkward."""
"Imagine, I go away for a few days.."
and my boyfriend is living with a woman he got pregnant.
"So, what'd you tell him?"
You didn't tell Mona Rachel moved in?
She seemed to think it was such a crazy idea.
"Plus, she got me taffy."
-Really?
I've never had any.
-Ever?
My mom was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats.
Thank you.
Are you gonna tell her?
I will.
I want to butter her up first.
"I'm gonna take her to dinner, do all this romantic stuff."
When she thinks I'm the best boyfriend ever..
I'll tell her my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.
"If I haven't said it before, she's a lucky, lucky lady."
So where are..?
What the crap is up with this stuff?
Is it gum?
Is it food?
What's the deal?
"Oh, it's nice."
May I try a pink one?
So I just have to plan the perfect night.
"Hey, what's the best date you ever had?"
Drop the weapon!
It's over!
Aah!
Aah!
Get away from me!
"Trevor, you don't want to do this."
Let me help you or you're gonna die.
You help me?
"Yeah, right!"
I know about Preston.
I know that he put you up to all of this.
You damn half-breed!
You don't know anything!
"Trevor, we pulled your phone records."
You called Preston 13 times today.
So what?
!
"We pulled his voicemail messages, too."
"He's using you, kid."
That's why he won't call you back.
Get out of here or I'll kill this bitch!
Listen to me.
Just listen.
"When those men broke in your house, you know who ended up buying it?"
It was your man Preston.
And he got it for nothing.
You're a liar!
All you people do is you lie!
"The men convicted of killing your family, they both said somebody paid them off to do that job."
They just couldn't prove it.
So now they're doing life.
"Yeah, well, they should have gotten the chair!"
No more mummy wife from now on.
Your eyebrows are going to be attached to here soon.
Then you'll be a monster.
"I'm warning you, this is really the end."
I feel like death.
"When you're sleeping next to a mummy, you yourself feel like you're dead."
Do you know how scary it is to see a mummy moving around at night?
Do you have nothing else to talk about?
I'm only saying it because it's us three.
Why are you still wearing that?
Is there still some bruising?
People will find out.
Stop it.
And the kids?
"They're here, they wanted to take a look at some things."
My husband's almost here as well.
The guest has arrived.
I'm not late.
I'm five minutes early.
I just got here as well.
Hello.
Hello.
Take that off.
"Right, shall I?"
Why is it so hot?
I'll be taking this off.
Sure.
She's got a sty in her eye.
She didn't want you to see it so she got surgery.
Oh...
This color!
"Oppa, pretty, right?"
Take a shower.
They're gonna be here soon.
You need to clean the grill.
"Why can't we just stay in, just the two of us, and just not do that?"
"You mean like when I'm up and I am doing things, and you're asleep?"
Let's save that for another afternoon.
Get up.
The joke's on you.
I'm not a ventriloquist dummy.
- That's all right.
- It's all right.
It's all right.
- You could use that in your act.
- I could.
You want cheese?
- Cheeseburger.
Cheeseburger.
- It's funny.
Can I do it?
Do you mind if I...?
I just don't need everybody touching my cheese.
Just...
No.
This will be mine.
- I'll have cheese.
No cheese for this guy.
- I can't have dairy.
I'm taking this cooking class where we're learning how to make a curry carrot corn queso.
It's like a dip.
"It's for Christmas and couples, or you can put it on salad."
- Was it sponsored by the letter C?
- Ha-ha-ha.
No chicks.
"Yeah, like you'd know what to do with one, you virgin!"
I know more than you!
Are you forgetting about that fox at the lake I boned all last summer?
How come we never met her?
I told you she died of leukemia.
Last time you said it was polio.
"Polio is a gateway disease to leukemia, stupid."
"Hey, look, Claire's here."
"Oh, she's so fine."
"Why don't you fuck her, Kevin?"
I blew my shot with her.
She was just about to touch it when my stupid brother boner-blocked me.
I'll never get laid.
"Hey, you know, I heard about this loose girl that goes to Roberto Clemente High."
She asks you to come to her house for a free haircut.
And then she fucks you.
"Well, that's something."
What's her name?
- I don't know.
Haircut Girl?
- That's no help!
"Oh, fuck it."
I'm gonna go talk to Claire.
"- No, you're not."
"- Oh, yeah?"
Watch me.
I will not die a virgin.
Ow!
My dick!
"Goddamn it, Maureen."
Don't sit like that.
"- Write, I guess."
Write?
What about?
You've had no life!
"Anyway, it doesn't matter."
I don't want it anymore.
I didn't know you before.
You were just some bloke.
But now...
We're friends.
I think.
I don't want to do it.
The money's not important.
"It might not be to you, but it is to me."
I want some of that to go to Frances.
Ten grand.
"Look, Paul, son."
"If this weekend showed me anything, it's that I want some good to come of my passing."
"Now, if I jump from that bridge, the only thing I would've left behind was a traffic jam all the way up to the Angel."
This way...
I get to give something to me little girl.
That's something I wasn't able to do when I was alive.
And you'll get your money.
Everyone's a winner.
- Now that's how I want it.
"- For fuck's sake, I don't want the money!"
I'm an idiot.
I didn't think things through.
"It seemed like a good idea at the time, but it's not."
It's crazy.
I can't do it.
I won't.
- Malaysia.
I was in the area.
- Kramer.
- Just drive.
All right.
"Now you listen, and you listen good."
I know who you are.
You're the scofflaw.
- What are you talking about?
- Don't play dumb.
"It's me, Cosmo."
"All right, so it's me."
So what?
You don't think I know how you're feeling every second of the day?
Looking over your shoulder to see if someone's coming up sitting alone at night knowing they could be closing in.
"- I can't sleep, I tell you."
I can't sleep.
"- Of course you can't, you poor sap."
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I couldn't.
I couldn't tell anyone.
So you've been living this secret by yourself?
- It's been awful.
- Yeah.
I wanted to tell somebody.
"- Help me, Kramer."
Help me.
"- All right, I'm gonna help you."
"I'll try some on, we'll see how they look."
It's just hair.
Ever see what that looks like in the back?
You got natural curls on the bottom and that big phoney mat coming down on top of it.
Then the next thing I knew he had me pinned up against the wall.
It's OK.
Take your time.
He said he had a knife.
"And that if I didn't do what he wanted, he'd kill me."
And he told me to open the door.
And...
I was so scared I couldn't find my keys.
"You're doing really well, Lucy."
He got really angry and... he ripped the back of my dress.
With a knife.
And... he started touching me.
This car horn started beeping.
And he just grabbed my bag and ran off.
And...
I heard the cab pull away.
Can you describe the cab?
"It was green, I think."
Maybe blue.
Did you see his face?
Only for a second or two.
Anything else you can remember at all?
Something that sticks in your mind?
He had these trainers on.
They were white with a blue stripe.
And one of them had orange paint splashed on the toe.
It was on the right foot.
OK.
You've done really well.
"Thank you, Lucy."
"Right, if you'll excuse us."
Looks like the fiance is off the hook.
I'm not him.
"Uh, I know that, Aubrey."
(chuckles anxiously)
"He left his wife, he left me."
"You know, I would-- I would never ever do that."
What are you saying?
"I'm saying that... when I commit to something, it's real."
That I'm serious about us.
Did I say the wrong thing?
No.
"Of course not, Aubrey... (sighs) ...but there's a lot going on."
I know.
"And when it's all taken care of,"
I'm gonna feel the same way.
BRENNAN:
"I know this is difficult, Booth, but... (groans) ...you're gonna get through it."
"Yeah, sounds like something Aldo would have said."
He was right.
(Booth groans)
"Yeah, but this is different."
"Bones, he, um... he died... 'cause he was trying to protect me."
What do you mean?
You know that X-ray that we saw in the sound studio?
I know who that was.
There was no name on it.
I looked for that.
He died of a gunshot wound in the head.
Center core.
"3,000 feet away."
I'm the one who made that shot.
That is a ridiculous assumption.
There are other snipers capable...
The house was gone.
It wouldn't be the worst thing to stay here a little longer.
It's comfortable.
"Well, depends on your definition of comfort."
"I mean, Al, I'm hardly ever here."
"It's not for me, it's for you."
Is it?
-Can you get me some lemonade?
-I'll see if there's some around.
-How'd you sleep?
-I don't know.
Whatever you hit me with took me down.
I feel fucking drugged.
"Yeah, well, you were drugged."
-I don't like downers.
-You weren't liking the uppers either.
Yeah.
-I told you not to call my house.
"-Look, I had to contact your family."
You're underage.
That's the law.
My mom's gonna kick my ass.
"I mean, she's freaking now."
But she's gonna torch my fucking ass when I get out of here.
Why are things so wrong with your mom?
I don't know.
You seem like you do.
"She just doesn't get me, all right?"
"She's in my face about my grades, my hair, my friends, tattoos."
All this other shit.
You know?
I can't do nothing right.
- She looks mad.
"No, that's just her look."
What's that?
"- ""It looks like her number came up."""
- It's a zinger.
She's a lotto girl.
Her number came up.
Get it?
"You remember last year sergeant Beecham shoved that junkie into a lamp post, and he said, ""i'll keep you posted."""
- I heard about that.
- Everybody heard about it.
"I mean, people were repeating it."
It was famous.
This is even better.
- This is a classic.
- If you say so.
"Yeah, I just need to find the right moment."
"Captain, if you're ready to release the body, I can take her downtown."
I still don't get it.
Who'd want to kill the Lotto girl?
I guess her number came up.
"- Hey, what are you doing?"
"- Hey, what are you doing?"
"- That was my line, man."
- What are you talking about?
I just said the exact same thing two seconds...
Ask the captain.
"- This is a crime scene, for god sakes."
"- No, you heard me."
You know what?
He must've heard me.
"It's okay, look."
You want to take a swing?
Do it.
Nothing would make me happier.
Just want you to move your truck.
What was I thinking?
"You only beat women, right?"
Listen...
"You're not paying for a double, and even if you... even if you were, it wouldn't include Crazy Horse over there."
That's a whole other deal entirely.
- I'm trying...
- You're not trying hard enough.
"Get rid of him soon, or this doesn't happen."
He left New Haven an hour ago.
He'll be here.
"Yeah, well, I'm just saying."
"No, you're just worrying."
Hmm.
Where else is he going to go
- with a Geiger counter?
- Huh.
[phone rings]
"Hi, Julia."
I did what you asked.
I got him to the restaurant and made sure he was facing the door.
Thank you.
"Look, I know how tough this is for you."
Tough?
This is...
This is tough?
"No matter how this goes down, I lose."
"You get that, don't you?"
"If you're right, the father of my son is nothing better than a con man."
I can't afford to run down the boss's daughter.
Why don't I pack us a picnic lunch?
This is the kind of a day to play hooky.
I've already thought of that.
Good.
But I'm on my way to pick up Nancy.
"There was a washout last night, and the train's been stalled about five miles out of town."
Oh.
"Well, I guess a big railroad like that can get her here safely."
"Probably, but I..."
I did promise to pick her up.
"All right, I'll go with you."
"No, but I promised her, I..."
Unless I'm in the way.
"Oh, no."
"No, you're not in the way."
(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING)
What happened in Los Angeles?
"I saw Colonel Blair, and he thinks I should get my papers in a week or so."
I know Karen Blair quite well.
Perhaps I can speed up your orders?
That'd be wonderful.
Don't mention it.
Beautiful tune.
"The words are pretty, too."
Do you know them?
I think so.
* Love is all that matters
* And we've got love
* We have walked off with a prize
* The stars that I used to see
* Are not where they used to be
Your petticoat's showing.
Ek Number!
All's well!
Do Number!
All's well!
Teen Number!
All's well!
Chaar Number!
All's well!
Paanch Number!
All's well!
Swing those picks there.
You think this is a strawberry festival?
Shake a leg with that pole.
"Come on, get it up there at the double."
This is a fine time for things to go quiet.
Blast them Thugs.
Why don't they come and give us a good fight?
Then Bal will be a pipe to re-enlist.
"Come on, hurry up, I told you."
How can we get a nice little war going?
What if I were to blow up the Taj Mahal or one of them sacred tombs?
"What do you want to do, start the Indian Mutiny again?"
"Annie, get your back into it!"
Hurry up!
He's even snarling at poor little Annie.
"You can't work 24 hours a day, you know."
"In another 24 hours, my time will be up."
I don't want to leave anything undone that might detain me.
"Get it up, hurry up."
He's tired.
It just goes to show you what a piece of dry goods will do.
Whatever's happening to you penguins... don't blame it on me.
I'm not.
But you can help save them.
"Listen, fella, you look after your kind, and I'll look after mine."
"If I thought like that, I would have left you in that hole."
"That's it, I'm claiming a forfeit."
Get off my beach!
"Wayne, now I'm really gonna hurt you."
I saved your life!
And I'm gonna save yours.
Take your furball and fluff off... or I'm gonna turn carnivore... with a craving for penguin.
- But...
"- The only ""butt"" I wanna see is yours... walking away."
"Come on, son."
We're wasting precious time.
There's nothing for us here.
"Now, where was I?"
- Right here.
"- Oh, yeah."
- What are you looking at?
- What are you?
BRYAN:
"I don't know, but it sure is ugly."
ERIK:
"No, Pa."
This is so unfair.
[SINGING] After all you have done.
You really deserve better.
Nothing makes sense in this world.
It's all a big pile of crazy.
And the kings are all fools.
BRYAN:
"Just get off of him the best you can, but don't let him roll in that saddle."
I think that...
I need that horse!
Shit.
Stop that horse!
I need that horse.
Get that horse.
I can understand you smaller children... but you older children have no excuses.
"So, we're going to stay until you get it right."
"Now, I don't want any erasures, so turn the page and start fresh."
Put that mouse in your pocket.
I brung you a horse.
Class dismissed.
"Lord, it's like a stampede."
- I'm not dressed for riding.
- Sure.
Go on home.
Go on.
- I'm not dressed for riding.
"- Why, sure you are."
"Why, women ride all the time dressed like that."
I busted that horse for you.
"Come on, I'll boot you up on him."
- He's beautiful.
- He's a good horse.
"Come on, I'll put you up there."
Okay.
Done.
You all right?
- How do I get...
- Take hold of these reins.
"Grab his reins, grab a little handful of his mane."
It hurts when I breathe.
"Okay, Judy, I think you've broken your breastbone."
"Add a sternal view, troponin, CT of head, abdomen and pelvis."
What else can you tell us about the vehicle?
There was a bike rack on the roof.
They tried to force me off the road.
They wanted to steal my car.
Am I bleeding?
You hit the window.
It's not bad.
Will I need stitches?
"Did either of them have a weapon, ma'am?"
I don't know.
It happened so fast.
I just wanted to get out of there.
Enough for now.
She's had a concussion.
We need to let her rest before she goes up to the CT.
- We're working here.
"- Sorry, Luka."
We've got a trauma.
We need the room.
"All right, here we go, gently."
Lift up the neck.
"On my count, one, two, three."
Here we go.
We're out of infant C-collars.
Luka do you know if we have any infant C-collars?
You can use towel rolls.
Airway is patent.
I can't hear breath sounds with all the crying.
- Do we have a sat?
Is everything okay?
"Pete, it's over."
We won.
Wait.
W-What does...
What does that mean?
Lance offered me the cash.
Oh.
Great.
You bet your ass it's great.
"Our con was so good, we got paid in phase 1."
Not bad for first timers.
"Uh, yeah."
We're naturals.
"I mean, technically, Lance won, but... but the important thing is that you got the money back, so that's good."
Hold on.
Hold on.
W...
"What do you mean, Lance won?"
It's called a Jesus con.
We never talked about this?
"A guy lights your house on fire, and then he shows up in the nick of time to put it out, making himself your savior."
A con man's not always after money.
Julia will think he's the hero.
She'll never believe my side.
"But the important thing is you got the money, so..."
What if I turn it down?
Why would you turn it down?
If I do... can we still con him?
"Grandma, let's just think about this for a second."
- A bird in the hand is worth...
- No.
I haven't felt that from you in years.
I'm sorry about that.
"Okay, so now, finally,"
Are you guys gonna get back together?
- I don't know.
- Me either.
- I have no clue.
- Me either.
- It's all new to me.
- Me too.
But look at you.
Look at the way you finish each other's sentences.
"Look how upset you were when she didn't call you back,"
And look how you didn't want him to know that you were back.
Look at all of it.
Can't you see?
This is who you are.
You're mom and dad.
"We are, but we're not alan and elaine anymore."
We're alan and elaine.
I'm glad you stopped by.
Me too.
I'll see you on the strolling path?
Until the strolling path.
"Got to hand it to you, David."
You make one hell of a wingman.
"Thanks, dad."
Where are you going?
To get Rita.
I'm not leaving you here alone with that whore.
Inspired by the events that occurred on social networks.
Come on!
Teach me.
Are you afraid?
You're right.
Because they're all dead.
All my teachers.
-What time is it?
-What?
We go to the club.
"We go to the club, we'll dance."
"There's nothing else to do, we might as well dance."
"Come on let's go, let's go."
-Are you looking for Adrian?
"-Adrian is dead, it's every man for himself."
"I'm delighted to see you, you don't know how it thrills me."
-You're glad?
-Sure I'm baby you're the man.
I love your sexy body.
-You're freaky.
"-Sure I'm baby, freaky for you."
Let's go to my place.
Come on.
Well now that we've had dinner and coffee and everything...
Why don't you take off your jacket and make yourself at home.
I really should update my notes.
"You're absolutely right, now is ""the"" perfect time."
This is gonna be the fuck of your lifetime.
-I got some coke.
-I don't care about that.
I just want you...now.
"Orgasms, wasn't that the subject we were discussing?"
I think that right now I should study the alien.
Whoever took that wallet was about the most stupid sneak thief in the world.
Why do you say that?
Because the risks are to great and the reward is too small.
"I always say that if you're going to steal at all, steal in a way that will be admired."
"Let's get out of here, hm?"
Where will we go?
Anywhere.
I know the perfect place.
First time I've ever been in a subway.
What a fascinating experience.
Everybody who comes here wants to ride in the subway.
You'll get over it.
"Say, what about those abc's you were telling me about?"
We'll get to that.
This is where I live.
What kind of a district is this?
See for yourself.
You know Park Avenue is only three blocks away?
But I'll never make it.
"You know, I think I'm gonna like you."
You won't tire my mind.
I might wear it out my way.
Go on in.
It's safe.
Thanks.
Fix yourself a drink.
Fix me one too.
What'll you have?
Bourbon.
How?
Straight.
Okay.
You're a good man?
You like to hit women.
You like to hit children.
"That doesn't make you good and it sure as hell doesn't make you a man, so stop talking."
"Okay, I'm..."
I'm a good man.
"And if you say one more word, I might have to show you what this good man does to people like you."
"Dr. Bennett, you might want to rein in that charming bedside manner."
"Trust me, I was reining it in."
He's seizing.
Darren?
I need suction and an airway now.
Your incision is healing well.
"Just keep the area, you know, clean and dry."
Okay.
Anything else?
No.
Yes.
Um... you should probably get some light exercise.
Just go walk around the block or something.
"You know, just get out."
Wow.
"Your... your lips are moving, but your words sound just like Pete's."
"You were in the closet, Violet."
"Look, I'm..."
I'm doing the best I can.
"No, I know you are."
I do.
"Oh, look at that smile."
That's gas.
Sorry to tell you.
"No, it is not gas."
What's with your attitude?
You don't think I was worried as well?
What are you doing?
I'll take a taxi.
Why?
Hurry and get in.
I'll be more comfortable in a taxi.
You should go first.
You're trying to avoid me nagging.
Yes.
"Fine, do as you like."
Stop it!
Hurry!
"Listen, just listen, all right?"
All right.
Take a deep breath.
As deep a breath as you can take.
You're so mean.
This is why you woke me up?
"I was right, wasn't I?"
There's no one here.
I was really curious how it would be like under water.
You're such a pervert.
We...
We what?
How will we be living in five years?
How will it be in ten years?
How will our feelings have changed?
What kind of person will you remember me as?
And when will I be able to let you go?
Will I be able to let you go?
"In five years, you'll probably be a father."
And now she's in the wind.
Kiddo.
Listen.
Go back to those twins.
They're your family now.
This was a bad idea.
So...
You.
Here.
This is what?
You giving up on working with your son?
Duval doesn't care what I think about this case or anything else.
You can't really believe that.
Your son wants very badly to please you.
Why do you think he became an FBI agent?
You don't follow in the footsteps of someone whose opinion doesn't matter.
You matter to him.
I never thought of that before.
He got into law enforcement because of me.
He wanted to please me. [Chuckles]
"His whole life, he just wanted to please me."
If he's her and I'm him...
Why am I here?
Because you want me to shut up.
Okay.
I'm good with that.
"No, no, no, no, no."
You want me to shut up.
You really want me to shut up.
And yet you still keep on talking.
Not now.
"I mean, probably now, but even when I was dead, did you ever hear me then?"
No.
"No, i guess it's just time for me to get out."
Nick.
"Jim, don't let him go!"
"If you're doing this for me, it's wrong!"
Don't worry.
He'll be back tomorrow.
"Just come from the gold exchange, boss."
It's buzzing over there like a hornet's nest.
"You know, i'm going to put a scare into washington till they padlock that treasury."
"There she goes, up again."
"You know, gold's jumped 4 points since you started buying it."
Jim.
"Oh, josie!"
You're just in time to see the fireworks start.
"Jim, where's nick?"
"In his office, i guess."
Haven't you seen him yet?
I've been waiting all day for him to come through that door.
It's not so far to come.
"But it's not so far to go, either."
"I'm sorry, josie, i can't do it."
"Please, boss."
"Jim, you've got to do it."
Do it for my sake.
"Hello, nick."
"Hello, jim."
Gold's just hit 125.
It's not too late if you still want to come in.
It's not too late for you to get out.
"Stop fooling with gunpowder, jim."
I won't stop until it hits 200.
"Jeeves, you don't mean you're leaving me still."
How are we gonna manage?
"The young lady may have some idea, sir."
I hear they generally have.
That's right.
I hadn't thought of that.
- Shall I have a go at it till the blacksmith arrives?
"- Yes, please."
"- Thank you, sir."
"- Thank you, Jeeves."
"Go on, take a card, any card at all."
Now look at it.
Put it back.
Ace of spades.
"- When did you change the act, Pop?"
- I didn't.
He did.
He did?
"Yes, he said straight magic is too old-fashioned."
"Wait a minute, take a bow."
"No, you take it."
I got to get married.
"Come here, they're applauding you."
They like it.
Lucky.
Now what?
"- I want to reason with you, if I can."
- But you already did.
Have you really made up your mind to leave me... just to marry some girl you happen to know?
"It's kind of customary to know the bride, isn't it?"
I hate to see you leave show business.
You know we wanted to be pregnant by now.
I can't take that kind of time off work right now.
"Besides, we need my income."
That's not an issue.
Come on.
I don't know if I'm ready.
What if we lose us?
Jess.
You will never lose me.
So what was it like in prison?
It's actually not so cracked out to be.
"If you could start your life over, what would you do different?"
Be someone else.
"That's sad, Roman."
Anyone can change.
"Change is a choice, you know?"
Change is a choice?
Where'd you read that?
Just made it up.
So when will I see you again?
Hard to say.
You're not going to do anything stupid are you?
"See, right there!"
That's what it's like being me!
Everyone always thinks I'm up to something.
I wonder why.
You're sexy when you work.
Norman.
"Right, hang on."
Lucky coin.
Damn it.
"You know, no one ever died from taking a day off."
You're both disgusting.
I don't want to be the guy gossip girl made me out to be.
So what are you gonna do?
Go backpacking... if you'll have me.
"Well, it's too late. i'm..."
I'm taking someone else.
"- Oh, really?"
who?
- It's me.
Him.
"Yeah, we're gonna have a great time."
Melissa and i.
Oh. really?
Daniela.
- Close.
- It's Vanessa but thanks for trying.
Please let me go with you.
I'm always doing what everyone else wants me to do.
I want to do something for me.
And we'll just go as friends.
Don't worry. it won't be anything romantic Unless you know we drink a little too much in Vienna one night.
How could you say no to that?
Seriously.
As long as you take off that ridiculous tie
So i can maybe try to picture you with a backpack.
What's wrong with my tie?
Mm. i need a coffee.
He's always wearing a tie.
So i'm the one who does the good deed
And that guy goes off with the girl?
It's good to be that guy.
Do you...you go here to n.y.u.?
"By the end of this, one out of four people in this country will know who you are."
The monkey too.
How does that sound?
What's that going to get me?
That would be great for you!
There's no file.
What do you mean there is no file?
There never was a file.
Then make a file.
"Sure, then tell me where to start."
I will.
Now.
Soon.
Stamps?
- Stamps?
What should I do with those?
I don't write letters.
I don't have anything else.
"I know, I know."
How long can you get by with this here?
"Franz, are you still there?"
Yes!
How long can you get by with this here?
I won't be here for a while you know.
Where will you be?
"Yeah, up north in Scandinavia."
Scandinavia?
That should be nice.
That's what I'm saying.
You have to make sure that you and your comrades here are taken care of.
I gave that poetry book of yours to Roswitha for her birthday.
She was quite delighted.
How?
I killed the people that fucked me.
"That's it, if you fuck me you'll die."
"Come on, baby!"
"No, it's true!"
It's not true.
I'm serious.
I'm serious too.
Hey you!
How many people want me see me fuck Margaret and not die?
It's too much Adrian
Lay off!
There's something very strange going on here.
I'm going to leave.
Right there's something strange going on here.
I bet you 300$ that I can fuck Margaret and not die.
Of course she won't die.
But I'm not sure watching you fuck is worth 300$.
But it sure sounds interesting.
I'd like to watch but I'm not sure Margaret's in the mood.
Adrian!
"You should stay away from me, I'm a killer."
"You like to fuck, baby, better than anything in the world."
I don't want you!
Why not?
Because I'm killing all the people that I fuck.
"You kill me bitch, that's the joke of all time."
Adrian...
Leave me alone.
You like it honey?
You like it...
"Don't do it, Adrian."
MAN:
You go get her.
Tell her to come out.
Tell her to come out right now!
Take a fucking seat!
We know you have to open the door from the inside.
Can you get her to do that for us?
It'll be a lot easier.
Fuck you.
I need to get inside the broadcast room.
I need the girl to open the door.
I need her to take care of some numbers for me.
Now this is something only she can do.
And I'm kinda on a tight schedule.
katherine:
They didn't know about the change in schedule.
We got here early.
I know about you and the girl.
"We know, okay?"
"Now we can offer you two a way out, a way through."
"And if you do what we say, if you help us, we won't have to hurt her."
There's no need for violence.
Violence is what got us all in this place to begin with.
This is the end of violence for us.
This is a new beginning.
It's a partnership.
And it starts by you getting her to open that door.
DAVID:
Fuck you.
EMERSON:
"Oh, shit."
Your leg.
Simon!
I'm coming!
Why is he being like that?
He's just drunk.
He'll come round.
LOVE
The perfect girlfriend would be...
Sweet and loving...
Back you up even in bad times.
Love...
I don't know if I've tried it...
"Well, of course I love all my friends."
I love mum and dad.
But real passion... no.
There's status in having the right boyfriend.
It gives you status.
If you're rich with loads of money it isn't cool to have a poor boyfriend.
A student on a... grant or whatever they go on.
The boys have most of the say.
It's always been like that among people like us.
They make the money.
She has to look good.
Of course she has to be nice.
If I'm going to marry her and have kids   and a joint bank account and all that shit   she's got to be nice.
- Is Sofie OK?
- Ask her.
- What happened?
- He doesn't want to discuss it.
- My sister's in a porn mag.
- Where can I get a copy?
- At the kiosk.
- You sisters are so fucked up.
"Bu next time you're staying, all of you."
Bye.
- Have a good night.
Come on you guys.
I don't mean to be rude but Can I get an autograph?
Oh yeah sure.
Thanks.
I'm a big fan.
Thank you.
Wow that is... a lot of tequila.
I'm just letting you know now that tequila and I are a wild mix.
Things might get silly.
All right but only if you do a wrap around.
"Go like this,"
I'm not going to let you put your penis n my ass either.
"It's an out hole, not an in hole."
Why are you being such a prude?
I'm not being a prude.
I'm just not a porn star OK!
You wanna announce our lake of sex in front of everybody?
I've just got the wedding on my mind.
Oh what a surprise.
You haven't had any input BTW.
"BTW, Jesus."
It's because I work and I don't sit at home eating chips and dip and obsess over the wedding.
What?
It is disgusting what you are doing.
You're a pig.
I'm a pig?
Hi.
Hi.
Are you guys Ok?
- Hey.
- Hey.
"I don't know whose day's been worse, yours or mine."
- You okay?
- Yeah.
You?
I never thought I'd see something like that.
It's different when they roll in on a gurney.
"Yeah, but you stepped up."
That's all that counts.
I did my job.
At least we saved one of them.
- So I heard she gave an ID.
- Partial one.
I filled in some details.
"What, you saw the guys?"
A glimpse as they drove off.
"- They were black, huh?"
- I think so.
You think so?
"Well, it was quick, you know?"
But- And I only saw one of them.
So that's why the cops are picking up brothers all over town.
I told them what I saw.
"What you saw, or what you thought you saw?"
"I was trying to help, Greg."
Can't you see you fed right into what they always wanna jump to?
"Look, I'm really sorry for what happened to you, but that's on the cops, not me."
It's all part of the same thing.
What are you talking about?
- I don't know.
"- So, what, now I'm a racist?"
It took me a year and a half.
It wasn't until he tried to hit my baby Stevie that I left.
A year and a half?
You leave your brains in a box somewhere?
He loved me.
Oh.
He told me so.
He just hit me 'cause I'm ugly.
You're not ugly.
You got a place to stay?
Yeah.
I found a cheap motel across from the airport.
"Cheapest place I could get, but... two or three nights working here, I think I can get a good place, move out of there."
And what if that bruiser comes looking for you?
He won't.
I talked to God at Kennedy Airport in New York before I left.
He told me that I have to live for my baby.
So I told him that I would kill anybody who tried to hurt me like that.
I don't think God is going to let Danny come near me again.
Dorothy?
Yeah?
I don't think it's gonna work out for you here.
I'm gonna have to let you go.
What?
I'm sorry.
It's just the way things worked out.
Help me.
What are you worried about?
I've known Frank Doss and Mr. Cannata for years.
"I'll speak to them, I'll explain things...."
It's gonna be all right.
Thank you.
Nobody in this town will pick him up.
Why?
"Well, 'cause everyone in town is here."
Quaint.
I like that.
What?
"Well, that was nice."
What was that for?
You're different from any guy I've ever met.
"When you talk to me, you look in my eyes, and..."
And what?
"When I hear your voice, it sounds really smart, and that makes me feel special."
"Me, too."
"So, any time you're ready to open up, I'm ready to listen."
I blame you.
What?
I blame you.
"I only kept this job to take care of you, you and the..."
"And the, the..."
Kids?
"Yeah, the kids."
I was just a bag boy who didn't have sense enough to leave.
And now that's what I am for the rest of my life.
"Oh, Alan, what you do for a living is only a little of what you are."
It's not mostly what you are.
"Well, then what am I, mostly?"
Mostly...
You are a person that I love a whole lot.
And I want you to be happy.
"Well, right now I am not happy settling for what I am."
What the hell are we looking at?
George...
"Um, I don't think she would."
Why not?
"Well, you see, it's like plants."
There's a time and a season for things to grow and bloom and then they fade and die away.
"Your mother and I have, uh, been through a lot of seasons together."
You mean you just don't like each other.
"No, no, no, no, I don't mean that."
"Well, you don't."
"No, we don't."
Why not?
I'm not the man that she wanted me to be.
And she's not the woman I fell in love with.
We both fell in love with a picture-- in our heads.
Not with each other.
Am I just a picture in your head?
"No, no, no, no."
You're the only thing I love in this world.
I don't want to go.
I know.
[sobs]
Do I have to?
"Well, it'll be a great vacation for you."
"Yeah, who wants to go out west?"
"Oh, what do you mean?"
"Arizona, Death Valley-- all those horses and cowboys and Indians."
"Yeah, bang, bang-- great."
Your mother's got a friend out there.
She told me.
You might like him.
"Well, you might."
"Billy, she's lonely."
She's doing the best she can.
Inter-planetary.
"So take him, Stanin."
"Look, tell me, do you love me?"
"Look, do you hear?"
Will you write to me?
"Tell me, do you love me?"
Will you write to me?
Manya?
Let's beat it!
Look...
We're just naturally loose!
"We can't broadcast this to our planet, nobody would believe it."
And why not?
"Because if they get to know this on our planet, then everyone will want to fly here."
And we don't have enough flying saucers for this.
It would be the end of our civilization.
You get it?
Hallo.
Hallo!
What do you think?
Should I write to her?
Don't pick it up!
What will you report to them?
This just isn't possible.
I'll adjust the message a bit so it won't be so shocking.
What do you think about this?
-No.
It's concealing facts.
-I know.
But it will be better this way.
Believe me.
I'll only a little bit more...
'Cause I'm gonna drop truth bombs.
You know how pissed off I was when U S Weekly said that I was on crack?
That's racist.
I'm not on crack.
I'm straight-up mentally ill.
Sure.
I got mental-health issues.
Sure.
"Well, you know, who doesn't, really?"
"Hey, has anyone seen Liz?"
Or Pete?
She went out.
"Well, who's in charge when they're not here?"
I'm in charge.
Oh.
Okay.
"Um, well, I'm not sure about this costume."
I think it's hot.
Thank you.
"I'm Jenna, by the way."
"Miss Maroney, I got the hemorrhoid cream you wanted."
It's for my face.
"Well, wherever you're putting it, I think it's working."
"You know, I don't think you'd like it, 'cause we work a lot of hours and it's live TV, which is risky."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I like risky."
"See, me and you, we play the game."
We know how to be acceptable.
"""Hello, great meeting."
"I drink coffee, please."""
This show is our chance to break the shackles.
'Cause the white dudes want to see us fail.
What white dudes?
"We saved her, too."
My God.
Your brother.
"This time, the governor won't have Serena to use as P.R."
He won't have to die.
We did it.
We sure did.
My husband must be sending out a search party by now.
I left my car at the hospital.
Will you take me?
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey."
Friends don't let friends drive in a state of shock.
I'll drive you home.
They stopped looking for me.
They stopped looking for me.
They stopped looking for me.
Does this have anything to do with Ruby?
"No, it's..."
It's the police.
That's who's supposed to look for guys like... him.
Seat belt's stuck.
- Thanks for the ride.
"- Hold on, wait."
- I'll walk you.
- That's okay.
"If I let a girl walk herself to the door on a dark night,"
I'd have to commit ritual suicide.
"You don't want my death on your conscience, do you?"
Or your blood on my sidewalk.
Yeah.
"Well, hold on, hold on."
I want Pete back.
"I want it in writing that Jenna's job is safe, and I want a cappuccino machine for the writers' room."
Fine.
I thought you were going to quit.
"Yeah, well, you don't know everything about me."
You weigh 127 pounds.
Yeah.
"Thank you, good night."
You will be hearing from Peanut's lawyer.
"Good night, sleep tight."
I can't wait to do this with you every week.
[Horn honking]
Hello?
Excuse me?
"There's a line, buddy."
There's two lines.
"No, no, there's one line."
We're in it.
I'm just getting a hot dog.
We're all getting hot dogs.
"What, do you think there's two lines and we're all in this line and you're the only genius that got in the other line?"
You believe this guy?
Don't line up behind him.
He cheated you.
"Hey, shut up."
"Now I want all the hot dogs, please."
"Yeah, I'm buying all the hot dogs."
You don't have to do that.
"No, no, no, You don't have to do that."
That is ridiculous.
And I'm giving them to the good people.
X-ray shows another reason for his condition.
There's a bullet-like metal thing in his brain.
The metal thing is moving.
It's pressing on his nerves.
"If we don't remove it, he'll go into a coma in 3 weeks."
He may even die.
Can't it be removed?
"We want to, but we are not confident."
Sorry.
Thanks.
You're awake.
How are you?
OK.
"What's wrong, Lisa?"
Why didn't you tell me?
What's that thing in your head?
Doctor says if it's not removed... you've only 3 weeks to live.
You tell me now.
It's nothing.
I got shot 3 years ago when on duty.
"I didn't remove it, afraid it'd affect me."
It's been in there since.
I've fainted many times before.
Don't worry.
Only it was longer this time.
I scare of such an unconscious feeling.
I'm afraid to sleep.
Afraid I'll never wake up again.
Lucky you guys were with me this time.
What's wrong?
3 years ago...
Is this reason you stopped courting me?
Are you going to clean it?
The Blue Diamond Hotel is right beside it.
I want to go there.
Do you see that bufalow?
"Yes, On the right."
Follow it.
It takes bath everyday in it.
What Madam?
You're just wasting time.
There's nothing in my bag.
I can see that you're a riot without a weapon.
"Show me the bag, okay go ahead."
See this is a pant.
And this is my Gun!
Where did that come from?
Put the gun down and surrender.
Yes I'll put it down but first let me think where it came from?
Give me the gun or...
I'll beat you so bad.
No Madam don't come forward.
A stupid fool like you will shoot me!
You're scaring a Jatni with spray.
"Ma'am this is my gun, actually the holi is coming that's why."
But when I saw your physique I got scared and...
I hid the gun in his bag.
Let him go.
Please Ma'am.
Let him go!
Gentleman is telling me to let him go.
Let him go.
You'll have to file an application for it.
"I obliged you, Aren't you going to oblige me?"
Maybe Caleb is the same.
It's only Hanna.
I wasn't asking who you were on the phone with.
Do you want the last bit of cobbler?
I can just bring it up for you.
"No, thanks."
Okay.
"- What do you mean, ""only Hanna""?"
- It's my mom.
Things are still sub-zero around here.
Did you tell her about Paige's dad?
No point.
She'll say it's my fault for choosing a disgusting lifestyle.
Paige is such a knob.
- I don't think it's all her fault.
- What do you mean?
What's going on between you and Aria?
It's nothing you have to worry about.
You were snarking at each other like you were on a reality show.
The Real Teens of Rosewood.
"Oh, tell me about Toby."
He says we have what he wanted us to have.
"It's the right message, I'm just reading it wrong."
He wants me to come to his house Saturday.
Are you going?
"If I don't, how are we gonna figure this out?"
I'm shut out with Melissa and lan.
- Where are you?
- What do you mean?
I'm right here.
Any fire truck you can hear at your house I can hear at mine.
"Oh, my God."
When my snitches get killed.
Those fuckers give me a giant hard-on.
"Some get laid, others freeze!"
We're on the wrong team.
"No, that's his last fuck."
We'll hump again.
You sure?
Big Luc to Fat Ass.
"Mercedes wagon, local plates, 4 men on board."
It's headed your way.
Long-haired guy is Frank Chenaf.
I nabbed him for a holdup 1 0 years ago.
A mean fucker.
I don't know the others.
Said and Jamel Attia.
I say it's for tomorrow.
Nabbing 'em in the act's dumb.
They'll fire at us.
We may lose them to avoid bloodshed.
What do you suggest?
"We hit 'em at night, and gun down the lot of them."
What about our ethics code?
I've wiped my ass with that for years.
They killed 9 men.
9 families call me every week hoping I'll have good news at last.
I owe it to them.
It obsesses me.
"Stay home, let Vrinks deal with it."
I've worked 2 years on this case.
It's my collar as much as anyone's.
"OK, but you'll be back-up."
You only move in on Vrinks's orders.
"We had California plates, but our car broke down in New Mexico, so we had to get a new car."
"I told you it wouldn't make it, Ray."
But he wouldn't listen to me.
This one will make it.
Make it where?
Philadelphia.
My mother lives there.
She's sick.
"Ray is my boyfriend, so he got stuck with the job of taking me there."
Richard's our friend.
He's just along for the ride.
Uh...
"We weren't speeding or anything, were we?"
"No, ma'am."
What the fuck did you stop us for then?
I want you to get out of the car one at a time.
"You first, ma'am."
Get your hands up.
"Hey, calm down."
"You said ""Get out, you first, man,"" right?"
"Step around to the rear of the car, and keep your hands where I can see them."
"You said ""Get out of the car."" That's all I'm doing."
What's wrong with you?
You told us to get out.
"Ray, do what the man says."
"Stay where you are, ma'am."
Now you put your hands on the car.
Spread them out.
Now spread your legs.
"Okay, same thing."
Hands on the car.
Spread your legs.
I want Danny to spend more time with my son.
He made plans with him and now he's trying to pull out.
"And guys ""pulling out"" is why I have a kid in my first place."
"Okay, fine, I'll do it."
But it's not fair.
You asked me right in the middle of sex.
"I was like... ""Ah, ah, ah... oh, okay, I'll take your son to Dave  Busters."
"Okay, quick announcement."
It's a new year and I wanted to shake things up a little bit.
So I decided to dye my hair red
- But then I chickened out.
"- Thank God, because red hair is the worst."
"However, I did convince Candace to do it."
Yeah!
Ta-da!
You like it?
I love it.
I love it.
It is beautiful.
It is great.
Like a bowl of tomato soup.
"If I had a grilled cheese, I would just dunk it on your head."
It's like your whole head's on fire!
"Love you, fire head!"
Now all we have to do is fill in the gaps.
I'm buying it.
Down payment.
"Call it rent, call it what you like, but I am not leaving London."
- Hmm!
- Sorry.
Bad night.
"Buckley, Parfitt, meeting now."
"That way, we don't have to think about it."
"We don't even have to look either, because we're never gonna miss it that distance."
"It's a good plan, Daze."
A real good one!
- You think so?
- Totally.
Cool.
- Don't aim too high.
- Why not?
We don't want to that little bird.
"Oh, yea... good thinkin'."
Are you ready?
- Ready.
- Let's do it.
Who wants a snack?
Be careful they're hot.
Uhm... no thank you.
- Don't you like cookies?
"- Yeah, but..."
I feel kind of bad now.
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Are those oatmeal?
"Thanks, mister."
What's wrong?
"Wait a minute, did you put something in this?"
Why are you looking at us funny?
"No, no, no..."
It just that you girls aren't what I expect it.
We didn't picture you either.
Keeps life interesting I guess.
Do you have any milk?
"I hate to interrupt or anything, but... don't you think you girls are better be load?"
"But I'm not referring to you, Moonsook."
You're different from your films.
"Sorry, but you're actually just another Korean man."
What are you sorry about?
"No, I take that back."
My point is you are a Korean man.
"Hey, I'm going back to our room."
I'll be back shortly.
Not coming with me?
That was a hit-by-pitched ball.
Stricter rules will apply to this.
"If you let the ball hit you when you could've dodged it, it's either a ball or a strike."
Like a regular strike or ball.
"Even if you get hit, it may not be a hit-by-pitched ball."
- Doesn't apply to intentional hits.
"- Yes, that's right."
He's in the bathroom.
Want to get some fresh air?
"Yeah, sure."
Wait.
This way.
I don't think we can go any farther.
Shoes are all wet.
- You know what?
- Yes?
"As I get older, I like the west coast."
It's where the sun sets.
And also where the stars rise.
That's right.
Why are you laughing?
Come on.
"Ah, I got a question."
You told me to do whatever it takes to stay in.
That didn't including shooting your fellow agents.
Those guys should have never been there.
That's not the point.
That's exactly the point.
God damn it David.
You shot three agents.
I winged them.
I tried to keep them alive.
Which is more than they did for me.
They didn't know who you were.
I told them.
I surrendered.
What do you want me to do?
So are you taking me off the case or what?
"No, I wish I could."
"Believe me I wish I could, but no."
Is that it?
You risk blowing my cover to chew me out?
You risk blowing my cover to chew me out?
"No, littman told me to find out if you had gone nuts."
"So, I'm going to tell him you haven't, right?"
You tell him whatever you want.
Oh no.
"I'm going to tell him that you haven't, right?"
Will that be all?
Yeah.
Hi.
"Hello, Mr. Davis."
I am yuko.
How are you doing?
Mr. sawamato said you found this place empty.
I knew I had 'til eight or nine o'clock to talk Jimmy out of killing Morrie.
"But meanwhile, as far as Jimmy knew, I was going along with the program."
I pulled out his hair. I bit him.
He's out fuckin' cold.
I'm enraged.
I wanted to kill this little fuck.
I walk away.
We start to go in the fuckin' joint.
I don't want to turn around.
Jimmy's going like this to me.
I don't want to fuckin' turn around.
I don't want to turn around.
"He picks up his fucking head, he says, ""Ah...."""
"I said, ""Don't say it! """
"""Jerkoff! """
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
I fucking fly at him!
"I got him and I'm banging his head, biting his fuckin' face."
I'm pulling his hair out of his head.
I beat him to a fuckin' pulp.
"To a fuckin' pulp, I tells ya."
He's laying there full of fucking blood.
I'm out of breath.
Forget about tonight.
Forget about it.
It was like a load off my mind.
Poor bastard.
He never knew how close he'd come to getting killed.
Even if I had told him he would have never believed me.
"-Jimmy, could I talk to you now?"
-You're a pisser.
You know that.
I won't get a fair trial.
I'm not going to no prison.
"Lila, Chief Dixon said the cops that are after you..."
Dale Dixon?
Yeah.
He was the one that was by the house.
"You used to know him, didn't you?"
"Yeah, I used to know him."
"Ronnie, I didn't come all this way not to see my baby."
"Now, they'll be watching our house."
So you got to take me someplace outside of town.
"Oh, Lila."
And then tonight you're gonna have to bring my baby out to see me.
And then tomorrow I'll be gone.
"Ronnie, please."
I'm your sister.
I need your help.
"Okay, Lila."
Okay.
RONNIE:
A friend of mine's grand-mamma died a couple of months ago.
She had a house off the highway past the bait shop.
There's no one living there now.
"I'm going to be out there all night, honey, so don't wait up for me."
Are Dud and John going to be with you?
"No, they're not gonna be with me."
We don't need 19 goddamn people in a car to watch a house.
I don't mean you're incapable of watching the house.
"Hey, just 'cause I'm not from L.A."
don't mean I can't watch a goddamn house.
Okay?
Don't be ridiculous.
- Maybe he's wrong.
- Wait a minute.
Let's see that.
- What do you think of that?
"- You know, you're in a hurry and..."
"Garnett, you're wanted on the telephone."
Just a minute.
I'll answer it for you.
It will only take about five minutes.
Let us have your pants.
- Hello.
"- Hello, John."
Will you hurry?
Tell him the minister is here.
Margaret's been ready for an hour.
We're all waiting for him.
"All right, I'll tell him."
- Who was it?
- It was the minister.
He said to take it easy.
He'll be about a half-hour late.
- Good.
"- You see, there's plenty of material."
- I'll take them down and have them fixed.
"- No, you don't."
"Pop, take them to Schmidt's and have them back in five minutes."
- You want two cuffs on them?
"- Yeah, one on each leg."
And hurry up.
Tell him I got to have them back right away.
"While we're waiting, we'll indulge in the famous indoor sport."
"No image, no arrests, no Internet profile."
- No way to see what he looks like.
- So I could go undercover as him.
"- Could be pretty risky, Bos."
- But worth it.
This is more than just a gambling ring.
I can tell you he's scheduled for some casino time after his 8:00 massage.
Looks like one of us is gonna have to rub down a bad guy.
Good idea.
Massage?
No.
No.
Don't look at me.
I'm the cruise director.
I've already given up my cover.
I'm a dude.
You guys suck.
That's nice.
"Just a little higher up the thigh, honey."
There we go.
"Just a little higher, babe."
"There it is, sweet cheeks."
Why don't you just relax and enjoy the pressure points?
How's about you shut up and give me the happy ending?
Okay.
I'll give you a happy ending.
Once upon a time...
The end.
Bingo.
- You're back.
- I am.
I felt a little underdressed.
"Is that right, Denny?"
I'm Pica now.
"Some days yes, other days no."
(Mouthes) Pica.
"The police have your DNA on the knife, the victim's blood on your clothes."
Witnesses saw you running from the lane.
They may have.
But I didn't do it.
He was alive when I found him.
"I took the knife out, but he died."
OK.
"Alright, we'll look into it further and get back to you."
You can't possibly believe him.
We've got our instructions.
Got your baggy eyes spot-on.
"Thanks, mate."
"Who is he, for Christ's sake?"
He is Pica.
What do we know about his prior?
Statutory rape. 15-year-old girl.
He was 19.
Girl.
Interesting.
You reckon it was a stitch-up?
"Well, come on."
"He looks like he did it, he sounds like he did it, he's homeless, he's got a serious prior."
It's the easiest stitch-up in the world.
Jails are full of guys who are there because they look like him.
You know?
No.
So you guys have sorted things out?
We haven't sorted out a bloody thing.
I got knocked up.
So my man proposed to me.
No.
Why did you have to quit too?
I'm pregnant.
He doesn't want me to work.
You can still work even if you're pregnant.
"If I was pregnant, I would still work."
You don't understand.
"I am having a baby, and it will affect the baby."
"If you play that card, there's nothing more to say."
Why are you upset?
I'm not upset.
You told me we would work side by side forever.
Yeah I did say that.
I'm sorry.
But you understand right?
I don't.
You can't do this to me.
Are you really mad?
You have no right to be mad!
Why can't I?
No.
Listen and stop worrying.
Your jobs won't disappear.
"I'll find a new person to take my place, okay?"
Why so mad?
Because nobody can replace you.
You can find someone better.
But I don't want it.
It's not you.
"For me, there is no Je 2."
- You slept with Jack?
- You slept with Vanessa?
Serena Van Der Woodsen here's looking at you.
Jack?
Blair?
Really?
That's calculating.Even for you.
I was sad and he tried to comfort me.
You call that comfort?
More like collusion.
Like you didn't do that with the dregs of d.u.m.b.o.
I'm standing right here.
I can't believe you slept with miss Carr.
And you were in jail?
I can't believe you let some guy take photos of you.
Wh-what was he doing there?
"No,no,no."
It wasn't as bad as it sounds.
Okay?
"You guys just stop it,okay?"
She's trying to create
A divide between us.
This is exactly what she wants.
We can't let that happen.
You want to know something?
I don't think it's her that created the divide.
I think it was you.
"You're the reason we're on ""gossip girl"" in the first place."
If it wasn't for you we'd all be safe.
Okay that's enough.
We all did what she said we did.
- You can't blame Serena for this.
"I'm used to it, but you?"
Are you saying you don't want to see me?
I'm saying that I'm scared of losing you.
The people I love all end up turning their back on me.
I won't be able to bear it if you do.
I don't fucking care if the judge can't find me a new home.
I'll manage.
Where will you sleep?
Under a bridge or on a bench.
"Anyway, it's cool you called me."
You'll sleep on a bench.
Or in a squat.
But it's dodgy.
There are always problems.
Sleep at my place.
We'll find a solution tomorrow.
Your place?
Just for tonight.
And don't tell anyone.
I'm not supposed to put you up.
Can I finish my pizza or should we go now?
"Go ahead, finish it."
I'll go and pay.
Your bathroom's so clean.
Don't you ever wash?
Help me with the sheet.
What are those marks?
Nothing.
You live alone?
- Yes.
"- You don't have a girlfriend, a wife?"
- I'm divorced.
"Second, you're lookout only."
You're not goin' inside.
Can't he be lookout?
It's fine.
"Actually, yeah, can he be lookout?"
I'm not done.
"Last, you need to respect my leadership skills."
"I'm the leader, okay, and you need to treat me accordingly."
"You realize that real leaders don't tell others they have leadership skills, but you got-"
"- You sure about that, man?"
"I mean, this is my heist, right?"
This is just a robbery.
"Look, this is your heist, you're the leader and I respect your leadership skills."
"Too late, homie."
All right.
All right.
You can come along on the heist.
It's not a heist.
Thank you.
"Hey, all right."
"Yeah, okay."
Thank you.
Yeah.
It means a lot.
You guys hear me okay?
Yep.
Clear up here.
All right.
Be back in a minute.
"All right, guys, let me show you how the big boys do it."
I'm buyin' boobs.
What are you gonna get?
Kike.
Did you hurt my baby?
"No, I..."
You son of a bitch.
"What did you do, where is he?"
Where is he?
I don't know!
You're going to find him.
"As God is my witness, you are going to find him."
"Yes... yes, you!"
"I'll call the police, I swear to God."
I swear to God I will throw you back in that cage
If you don't bring my baby home.
"Baby, how the fuck am I supposed to know"
Where he is?
I don't give a fuck!
I don't give a fuck.
"I don't give a fuck, you will figure it out."
"Go, go, go!"
"Okay, okay."
"Fuck, I'm ready to go inside and get in shape."
I think my baby girl is in for a treat tonight.
"(Man) Yo, that's the shorty that wanted me to wifey it up,"
But she let the next nigga hit it.
"I was like, ""How you want me to wifey it up"""
"And you let dude hit?"""
"Shit, that's why you can't trust these bitches, man."
"(Pete) Can't trust niggas, neither, man."
"Yo, she even got the name ""Danny"" tattooed on her pussy,"
"But I don't know if it was for me,"
"'Cause that nigga's named Danny, too."
(Laughing)
Only place I didn't try was the men's room.
- You try Munch's cell?
- Yeah.
No answer.
"You know, Dr. Swan had to make sure Kyle and the donor were okay."
Maybe there's a problem.
Come on.
What the hell is going on here?
"Casey, take Ms. Solwey out to the car."
Leave her out of this!
We didn't drag her into this.
"John, relax."
Relax.
Why'd you bring her here?
Amy's next on the transplant list.
That kidney would've been hers anyway.
"You're doing what we're trying to stop, John."
That kidney was bought and sold.
So let's just throw it away.
She dies.
I know that you care about her.
But you can't do this.
- If that was your son in there...
- It's not my son in there.
We're not talking about my son.
"When you collar James McGovern, you tell him your son's life is worth more than Kyle's."
"I gotta collar you, John."
You arranged this.
Novak saw you here.
You don't think Swan gonna give you up to get himself a better deal?
Why would I do that?
Did he ask you to put that kidney in Amy Solwey?
Did he hang himself?
No... he goofed it up.
He...
The rain.
What's up with you?
Soft in the head?
Did you get lost?
Yes.
"Here, with you."
"It's not like in the movies or in books, where everything is precise, thought-out, organized... with a clear-cut goal."
"Everything's chaos, chance... pain... disorder..."
"Still, my way of putting things in order is to get them, one by one, my mother's lovers."
There's one left.
Do you want me to tell?
No.
What for?
To know my life.
There is no life.
There's only a war.
Listen.
I can't hear anything.
Close your eyes.
Mary?
"You're gliding too high, friend."
You're gonna crawl back.
I won't cushion your descent.
You're overdosing.
"If I were human, I'd waste you here and now."
I'm not going to be human.
I won't go back on my word.
"I wouldn't want to hurry you, but theaters run on precise timetables."
Go betweens too.
Obviously.
The lash will loosen their tongues.
Put 'em onboard the ship.
Won't find it so easy to launch an escape from there.
No!
You take 'em!
And you stay with them till I send for you!
Excuse me.
I got hit over the head by two men over there.
Shut up!
You lad.
Come here.
Mr. Atkins obviously needs all the help he can get.
So you go with him.
What will happen to the women?
You leave the women here.
It'll give Captain Taylor something to consider if he tries to plan another escape.
And what are you gonna do about those two men?
What I always do to people who try and cross me.
We have to get those women to safety.
Come on.
Who are you?
Bless you.
Don't be afraid.
He's a friend.
I need you to take them to the tree house.
But he's a savage.
"Far from it, madam."
He's my best friend and he's your salvation.
And where are you going?
I've got to find a way onto that boat.
You'll be fine.
Are you angry because I'm here all fine?
Is that why you're mad?
Ok!
You can miss exits.
How can you go that far?
Are you stupid?
Fine you can forget your phone.
But wasn't there a phone booth?
You could have called!
I didn't think I would go that far.
I didn't even know that I didn't have a phone.
Did you know that I was waiting for you?
"No, I don't."
Excuse me!
Who are you?
I said I'm sorry.
"I'm really sorry, I want to die ok?"
Why are you so angry?
Is this worth it?
Did I do it on purpose?
"You even missed planes, did you forget?"
-It's twice now.
-Three times!
-Were you counting?
-I was never late!
Because it's always on your schedule.
You don't even care about my schedule.
"Whenever you call and say 10 or 20 minutes, I always had to go even I was on the toilet."
"Even then there could be traffic, or something could be wrong with the car."
You can be late!
But I should be able to call you!
The performance is driving me nuts!
I can't wait to dive in and find out all about you.
Mer looks weird.
Does she look weird to you?
She looks like she's gonna pee her pants.
"Oh, crap."
I made her hydrate.
Meeting the family always blows.
I'd never make you do that.
"Me, either."
One of the many perks of dating a dead guy.
Who's that lady touching Meredith?
Derek's mom.
"Oh, that's why she looks so weird."
"She does not look weird, okay?"
I've got it under control.
Mer is doing... great.
Looks like she's gonna pee.
"Dr. Yang, you mind checking on some of my post-ops?"
ER is swamped with traumas.
"Also, would you like to go on a date with me?"
I'm sorry?
A date.
"You said not to play hot and cold with you, so, um, I'll pick you up around 8:00?"
"Oh, and make sure mr."
Kenner in room 2-2-1-2 gets that enema.
He's been holding on to it for days.
Okay.
'Cause that wasn't weird.
"See, another perk of dating a dead guy."
No awkward dates.
"2-to-1, but who's counting?"
Why can't I have that nice man's organs?
"I let my guard down, fell madly in love, planned a huge wedding, and the guy didn't show up."
"- Wow, that really sucks."
- No kidding.
Must have been so humiliating.
I don't like to dwell on it.
"I mean, just standing up there in your wedding dress... and all those people staring at you?"
"The point is,"
I know a little bit about anger.
And it's not healthy to hold on to it... or to take it out on other people.
Especially someone as sweet as your mum.
It's killing her that she can't connect with you.
"I gotta tell you, whoever that guy was, it was his loss."
Thank you.
Because you must have been so hot back then.
Yes.
Way back then.
Oh.
Here she is now.
Talk to her.
It'll be fine.
I promise.
"Hi, sweetie."
"Listen, um..."
I don't know what to say.
Neither do I.
But we can try.
Really?
Yeah.
So where do you wanna start?
"Well, the fact that dad's engaged to a 25-year-old..."
Or that I think I have a crush on joy... and I'm pretty sure she's feeling it too?
"Oh, wow."
Thank you.
There is the possibility that we might not actually win this thing.
"Oh, yeah?"
Bite your tongue!
Bite your damn tongue!
"Look, guys, we don't date, we don't travel, we don't have any money."
The only thing that we do have is the 2.09 Competition.
"If we can't even win that, what's the point?"
"Hey, hey."
Look at this!
"No, no, no, no."
Yeah.
We suck.
"Your father would be so proud of you, Ben."
Yeah.
Do you remember anything about him?
Not really.
Maybe when he shaved?
"Yeah, I think I watched him shave."
"So, what are your plans for the rest of the night?"
I don't know.
I'll probably just go back and work on that essay.
"Ben, you're working too hard."
"Between the job and school and the 2.09, you've had no time for just yourself."
"You have to squeeze in a little time for fun, Ben."
You only turn 21 once.
And it goes by very fast.
Okay.
All right.
- Good night.
"- All right, good night."
- Don't come home before 3:00.
I didn't hear right.
I can't believe what I heard.
This is for you.
I got respect for this kid.
He's got a lot of balls.
Good.
Don't take shit from nobody.
He shoots him in the foot and he tells him to go fuck himself.
"Tommy, you going to let this fucking punk get away with that?"
What's this world coming to?
That's what the fucking world's coming to.
-How's that?
-What is wrong with you?
What is the fucking matter with you?
Are you stupid or what?
I was kidding with you.
Are you a sick maniac?
How do I know if you're kidding?
I'm kidding with you and you fucking shoot the guy?
He's dead.
Good shot. I'm a good shot.
-Hard to miss at this distance.
"-You got a problem with what I did, Anthony?"
His family's all rats.
He would've grown up to be a rat.
Stupid bastard!
I can't believe you.
Now you're going to dig the hole.
I got no fucking lime.
I'll dig the hole. I don't give a fuck.
is it the first hole I dug?
Not the first hole I dug.
We didn't scare him.
What's your name?
"Well, in Germany they call me Johann"
And here Honza.
That's what we call our pig!
"Well, Johann, you can sleep above the pigsty."
- The nights are warm.
- It's him.
Above the pigsty?
Is there no bedroom - er some tiny room?
There isn't.
"All right, I'm used to hardship on my travels."
"Go and turn the hay, up by the wood."
I'll feed Terry and then I'll help you.
"There's a rake, the meadow above the chapel."
He never killed himself working!
"Good, he's here, so we can keep an eye on him."
And we'll pay him back for his trouble.
We'll scare him out of his wits.
"If he doesn't behave, just call us!"
"What are you up to, Honza?"
You're slow!
Would you call me Johann?
You already have a...er - the pig Honza.
"As you like, Johann."
I'm glad I came at the right time.
"You can't do it all alone, poor girl."
I'm not alone - I have my Henry.
What's that?
You wait!
So those palace rascals are still bothering you.
With God's help I'll be home soon to protect you.
But I'm gonna get you through it.
"Oh, God, I'm gonna throw up into your cut."
"Ahhh, I saw inside of you."
How are humans alive?
"Okay, uh, I'll do the surgery, and, uh, you just breathe, okay?"
We'll get you through this.
Okay.
"Ugh, what was that sound?"
I did not like that squish sound.
The pipe has been removed.
Now...
I'm sewing myself up.
"Okay, this is almost over."
You're doing great.
Just keep talking.
Keep talking.
Talking about what?
"Uh, tell me about Amy, hmm?"
You must be excited to see her.
"Very much, you know."
"Oh, God, what if it doesn't go well?"
"We haven't seen each other in a while, and what if it's weird?"
- Uhhh!
"- Keep going, keep going."
You're doing so well.
Why would it be weird?
I don't know.
I don't know.
"I mean, maybe we've grown apart."
Maybe she'll be repulsed by my frosted tips.
I was gonna defrost them before I saw her for the first time.
I'm sure it will be magical when you see her.
-Ninety seconds.
Ninety seconds is a long time not to think about it.
Except all I did was think about it.
I know.
It haunts me.
"Till now, the worst thing I'd seen was my dad doing shots off the houseboy."
"After this, I would gladly make that my screen saver."
We have to get past this.
We'll pretend it never existed.
I could do that.
Now all we gotta do is get rid of this chair.
"-Oh, thank God!"
-I know.
Come in!
Hi.
I'm sorry to barge in on your Valentine.
I had to get away from the yelling.
Mona's dumping Ross.
"-Oh, my God."
-Poor Ross.
"We watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes."
You know that birthing tape you wanted to see?
It's here.
We should warn you before you watch it.
Don't watch it.
You saw it?
Is it scary?
It's ironic how footage of someone being born..
can make you want to kill yourself.
"Honey, she may not have to watch it but she's going to have to do it."
Now I'm all freaked out.
Will you watch it with me?
Aren't you rushing things?
I find you irresistible.
I'll bet.
You know something?
Take off three inches of paint and you'd be quite attractive.
How do you like our country?
After tonight I'm going to become a citizen.
After tonight you'll be entitled to citizenship.
"Well, how long are you gonna be?"
Can't you see I'm busy?
Who was that?
My husband.
Your husband?
"Relax, we're not married anymore, we're just good friends."
He lives down the hall.
"Oh, come on, let's get out of here."
Where to?
I'll change my dress and I'll show you the town.
Which one?
"Oh, I don't know."
You're a better judge at that than I am.
This is my new one.
"Say, that's pretty."
I'll get into it.
I won't be a minute.
"Well, uh... take your time."
You married?
No.
Never been?
No.
How come?
I don't know.
"If you can't hold it, you take your ass to the men's room and cry in private on the toilet."
- Like a man.
- I need to use the men's room.
"Look, I know where Betty put the key."
I can get it tomorrow.
She's not gonna stay in her office all day.
What?
I thought you gonna start squawking about how dangerous it'll be to go back.
"Squawk, squawk."
I'm not gonna wag my finger.
It's Chuck's life and she can live it however she'd like.
I can't expect her to sit inside all day and...
- Hide!
"- No, I don't need to..."
"Woman, hide your ass."
"Oh, Vivian."
"I didn't know you were here, um."
We're just closing up.
There.
All closed.
- There's still people inside.
- Cleaning crew.
How are you?
"To be honest, I wasn't craving pie, I was craving company."
Lily absconded with herself.
First time in 30 years I don't know where she is.
I didn't know where else to go.
It's all right.
I'm sure Lily will be back.
"Oh, yes."
Though I don't know about Olive.
"And then of course, there's Charlotte."
"So I'm moving on, letting go."
Holding on to tomorrow.
I've always got the memories.
While I'm finding out who I'm gonna be.
We might be apart but I hope you always know.
You'll be with me wherever I go.
It's time to show the word we've got something to stay.
A song to sing out that will never fade away.
I know I'll miss you but we'll meet again someday.
We'll never fade away.
"So I'm moving on, letting go."
Holding on to tomorrow.
I've always got the memories.
While I'm finding out who I'm gonna be.
We might be apart but I hope you always know.
You'll be with me.
"So I'm moving on, letting go."
Holding on to tomorrow.
I've always got the memories.
While I'm finding out who I'm gonna be.
We might be apart but I hope you always know.
You'll be with me.
"Yeah, wherever I go."
"Wherever I, wherever I go."
[Music stops]
[Audience cheering]
Whoo!
"[Singing to the tune of ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star""]"
It used to be that no one knew.
"Except a very, very few."
-Lilly.
-Ollie.
"You don't want to die, huh?"
"Well, don't worry about it, sonny."
I'm gonna let you live.
"Oh, boy, thanks."
"Oh, boy, you're welcome, but on one condition."
"You gotta keep your mouth shut, you understand?"
Sure.
You don't talk to nobody.
You just keep your mouth shut.
(AGREEING) Don't say a word to no one.
You keep everything quiet.
You don't say nothin'.
Nothin'.
Nothin'.
You don't say nothin' to anybody.
You keep your mouth shut and be sure you just do like I tell you.
Then you won't get into any trouble.
Shut up!
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Someone's at the door.
Let's see who it is.
"Well, let's go."
You get the door.
"Okay, sure."
"But be sure when you open the door, you don't say nothin'."
Remember what I told you.
Keep your mouth shut.
Don't say nothin' to nobody.
"Just open the door, see who's there, and that's all."
You don't talk to nobody.
You understand?
"Just open the door, that's all I'm askin' you to do."
Jeremy!
What?
"Haven't you read the studies, Liz?"
A glass a day is actually good for you.
Lowers your blood pressure.
"And smoking's good for your lungs, right?"
What do you expect?
You said we're a family full of addicts.
I never said that.
You said that you were the only one who wasn't hooked on something.
"That's, of course, unless you count the wine."
You.
"And then there's Nick, who's famous for his zany hi-jinx, and Nick's mom, a pill freak."
Jeremy...
"I'm a guest in your house, right?"
Yeah.
"So do you think it would be rude of me if I told you, as a guest, that you're a spoiled little jerk?"
What do you think?
I need a ride to this party.
I am not taking you.
We have guests.
"Oh, come on, mom, what am I gonna do?"
Sit here and watch figure skating-- [whispering] Sit down.
I'll take you.
It was very nice.
Thank you.
Liz:
You're welcome.
"Well, you sure do give your mom a pretty hard time."
I see her...
Like...
Twice a year.
"- Not yakuza, are you?"
- I'm sorry.
I hand out flyers.
So you're a loser.
"I was a real estate broker, but I didn't accept voluntary retirement, so they tried to force me to quit by making me hand out 2,000 flyers a day."
I don't care.
"When I did that, they made me do 3,000."
They know it's impossible.
"They want to make me quit, and I want to quit."
But my kid's still in high school.
I need to send him to college.
Then stay away from drugs.
Some people kill themselves.
If you won't use drugs...
I'll stay.
I hope you cheer up.
Thanks.
Can I see you again?
Were you okay?
You're kind.
I fell bad for him.
Dangerous work.
"Yours, too."
Not like I want to do this.
I wanna work front desk at a top hotel.
"I actually want to open my own boutique store, too."
Thanks.
Take care.
"Hey, no, no, no!"
Can't I just have one?
I always wanted to eat all the nuggets myself.
All the nuggets?
"Wait, wait, wait."
I haven't got it turned up enough.
Basil!
I said I suggest...
"Oh, my head, my head!"
Has it come away?
Did you bang your head?
Yes!
Yes!
"Oh, dear."
Let me have a look.
You'd better go and lie down before something else happens.
Shut up!
Why don't you call the police?
"We will, the moment we've searched the rooms."
My money's been taken!
"Yes, yes, I know."
Try not to speak.
Is this a piece of your brain?
£85.
Take my arm.
"I don't need your arm, thank you."
I can get down the stairs perfectly well by myself.
"""Down"" the stairs?"
Don't stop when you get to the basement.
Keep straight on.
Give my regards to the earth's core.
Are you sure you can manage?
"And if you give us any more trouble, I shall visit you in the small hours and put a bat up your nightdress."
"Well, that was fun, wasn't it?"
"The odd moment like that, almost worth staying alive for, isn't it?"
"It's nice to share a moment like that, isn't it?"
This is hard.
It doesn't have to be.
I just think the most important thing for you is going to be let him do the talking.
Right.
"Okay, you're right."
I got it.
I got it this time.
Hi.
Hi.
Excuse me.
That was better.
I am not cut out for this one-night stand thing.
It's not for everybody.
"I mean, I know it seems silly to you, Matthew, but I just wish somebody would notice me."
"Not as a mom or as a carpool captain, but as a woman."
Do you know how long it took me to do this to my hair?
A minute?
No.
"A long, long time."
"God, this is impossible."
"Come on, let's get out of here."
I'm never going to meet anybody in a grocery store.
"You met someone, didn't you?"
"Yeah, we had a moment over by the goat milk."
I think she's into me.
I'll see you at home.
Are you done with that cart?
"Hey, knock yourself out."
Wow.
"I don't want to embarrass you, but your hair is really pretty."
It must take you a long time to make it do that.
You're in a good mood.
- A real weird story.
- It makes me feel eerie.
I'm going to bed.
"Me, too."
I'm totally bushed today.
Good night.
"- Tomorrow, let's all go there and see."
- Go where?
See what?
Those two trees that committed double suicide by being struck by lightning.
Don't be stupid!
That happened a long time ago.
Those trees can't still be there.
I can't see them.
"Grandma told me they were still here, though."
Burnt trees keep standing forever because they won't rot.
There they are!
That's it!
Let's go and see.
Why don't we just look from where we are?
"I don't know why, but I'm a little scared."
"""Those two cedar trees look as if they have committed double suicide. """
"""We are two elopers."
"""Why not live next to them?"""
What are you doing?
Sorry!
I just got carried away because of the mood.
Stupid!
I'm going back!
Wait a minute!
"Hey, wait a minute!"
What's wrong?
"Well, I honestly think that you're a train wreck."
Hi.
Hey.
You look nice.
Thank you.
I'm glad you called.
Yeah.
"Um, I called to give you... this."
Found it...
"Grady's, yeah."
"He asked me to take my shirt off to see if I was wearing a wire, and the mouse ears, I don't know."
You don't have to do that anymore.
Case is closed.
"Okay, so how does it work, the dying part?"
"Well, in Switzerland, a doctor would give a patient such as yourself a lethal dose..."
"- Oh, my God."
- Of sodium pentobarbital with a drink.
"There is no pain, no suffering, you just fall asleep."
"An option is to go to Switzerland and be what they call a death tourist, and fly..."
So?
Did you ever find out if your mom was a drug dealer?
"Oh, yeah, she's like a kingpin."
She has a whole empire.
You're such an idiot.
Hey.
Who's cat is that?
It's Casper.
"I gotta go out of town, for another job."
How long will you be gone?
Maybe a few months.
And who will you be this time?
Hard to say.
"Well, he needs me."
You have your law and...
I have mine.
"Best thing you can do, Blake, is to get out of here as quick as you can."
You need medical attention.
Take the canoe.
"It's easy going now, but it won't be when the heavy snows come on."
Will you come with us?
"No, I'll stay here and work the mine."
"When you come back in the spring, we'll divide what I've found."
I came to say good-bye to Buck.
He never would have forgiven me if I'd forgotten that.
"Would you, Buck?"
You could have skipped that.
You're only making it tougher on everybody.
"Oh, Jack, put your arms around me."
"Well, I'll be seeing you."
Yes.
You'll be seeing me.
I'll be seeing you too.
Every day and every night and every minute.
This isn't the end.
It can't be.
Careful of that first stretch of rapids.
After that it's clear sailing.
"Good-bye, Thornton."
And God bless you.
"Good-bye, Blake."
"Good-bye, Jack."
"Good-bye, Claire."
"It's hard to say no to that call, isn't it, Buck?"
"It's all right, boy."
I think it's not a good idea.
-What do you mean?
-Maybe I call you.
But I don't think so.
-You didn't like it?
-I like it very much.
"But, Tony, come on."
"You're a nice guy, but I got my own problems."
I don't want all the time prop you up.
"What, are you fucking kidding me?"
-What you doing?
-I didn't expect you so soon.
Tell my uncle I'll talk to him later.
Lowe is not a 98-99 mile an hour guy.
Driven out to deep left field!
"Giving chase is Henderson, on the run!"
See ya!
An opposite-field home run....
-There ain't no bear back there.
-Fellas!
"Well, the way I feel right now, I'd like to meet a bear."
What would you do if you did meet him?
That bear would have just as much chance as this pork chop.
Where you boys all going?
It ain't over.
Somebody's going to get something they ain't expecting.
Have a bite.
"Look out, here he comes!"
Where's Furio?
"He couldn't get a flight out of Rome, so I'm driving again today."
"Come on in, he'II be right down."
You're not as important as this body.
When he said he was busy everyday...
I guess he had time to exercise.
"Then...when he said he was too busy, and didn't have the time,"
I wonder if it was all an excuse?
I wonder if he just didn't want to see me?
"What do you mean, he didn't want to see you?"
Even on that day...
He was on his way to see you.
That's right!
You said he even had something to tell you when he saw you!
The thing he was going to tell me when he saw me...
You think it was to tell me that he loved me?
What if it's not?
Gil Da Ran...
I love you.
Like this!
I'm sure he was going to say this to you.
Yeah...
I'm sure you're right.
"I'm sure that's it, right?"
That's it...
And here I am on my own...
How stupid I am.
"Yeah, yeah..."
That's stupid.
Let's pack up some clothes.
This color looks really good on Yoon Jae.
This color looks really good too!
Wow...
This color suits really well too...
Here.
We promised.
I thought you were OK with that.
Yeah.
That was when the wolf seemed a long way away.
"Now, I mean this room feels half the size it normally does."
I know what you mean.
It was fun the last full moon.
Yeah...
"Out there, all of us together."
It was...
It was a rush.
It was...
It was right.
"I mean, it was right."
Outside in a pack is where we belong.
The only reason we transformed outside last time is because we ran out of time.
"Mum and Dad, they won't let that happen again."
They can't stop us if we don't let them.
"Rhydian, I won't go against them."
"So, for the rest of our lives we'll just spend the one night we should we running wild, locked up?"
Yeah.
"No, I mean, no."
No.
I can't think about the rest of my life right now.
OK.
I'm with you.
Whatever you decide.
We stay.
Fancy coming to the exhibition with me?
Come on!
Don't you find it interesting?
What?
"Sir, get in here!"
"We have 5 deceased males and what looks to be a crude lab, all shot in the head execution style."
- Any anthrax on the scene?
- Only residue.
There's also packing and tags from 4 new backpacks.
"- All right, listen up."
- Backpacks?
They're already on the move.
We're too late.
Have you finished?
"As you said, the sun is set."
Yes.
I'd like you to meet a colleague of mine.
Dr. Reid.
- May we speak?
- Of course.
I have a little time.
That was a joke.
I have all the time.
Please.
A joke.
"- Well, we're making progress."
"- Yes, progress."
That is true.
Is there no way for this thing to end?
This Jihad?
The Jihad will end when Allah wills its end.
Then how will you know that it is Allah's will?
When the Jihad ends.
I have been lying to you.
Of course you have.
My colleague has been outside watching us as we talked on monitors.
Why are you so uncomfortable?
It's like you're somewhere else.
What is it?
"If there's a problem, I'll take care of it here immediately, so just tell me."
Is someone making problems for you or can you not pay the bills?
Dad!
"No, there's nothing wrong."
Why are you getting on his case?
This isn't the first or second time you've seen him.
"This isn't the first or second time, but it was bothering me."
It's so easy to bother you.
That's nice.
"I can't see your eyes, I can't see your third or fourth eye behind that."
- All right then.
- Good bye.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
"- Don't be late, it's at seven."
"I won't be late, I won't be late."
Good bye.
Seat him at another table tomorrow.
Ahjussi!
We should go too.
"Right, go, go."
You displeased me today.
Yes.
"Mom, stop it."
"- Bye, Ahjumma."
- All right.
I'll leave oppa in your care.
Don't worry.
"I'll call you, Oppa."
How were you going to act?
' I don't know.
I don't wanna take any chances.
We should get him as soon as possible.
'We'll be there in 24 hours.' I'll pick you up.
- You wanna go to the boat first?
- No.
First show us where he is.
He and his wife own a shirt shop close to Waikiki.
- How about his wife?
"- Yes, she's still alive."
- We may not have time for them both.
- That's OK.
He's our priority.
We're coming up to the shop.
It's busy.
I don't think we can take him here.
Don't linger too long.
He might see us.
"OK, I'll take you to the boat now."
"With those fancy shirts, that outrigger crew of yours had better win."
"Winning ain't important, pop, long as we look good at the luau later."
Typical Hawaiian philosophy.
"To win is important too, you know?"
You and Mrs Greenberg better be there Saturday to cheer us on.
Mama and I will be there.
You just win.
"OK, pops."
- What did you see?
- I don't have to see.
I feel.
- Here. it may be nothing.
- Nothing?
I'll just take it between us as who gets who first.
"That's how it's gonna be, then."
There won't be no more cows stolen.
"Not from the Wood River Cattle Company... the Bar-Three Cattle Company, or the Haley Cattle Company."
Consider that my last word on the matter.
"Come on, boys, let's have an auction."
"You know, I got a weird feeling."
"Yo, me too."
We're being followed.
Look!
Tell them what you saw here.
"That you, Horn?"
You coming in here after me?
Giddap!
Come on.
Get them up there.
Hang in there.
Come on.
"Let him stop first, then give him slack."
Hitch him up.
Hang in there.
Ease up on him there.
You got him.
"Yeah, he's a good horse."
You go ahead... ride him around a little bit and tire him out.
Keep his head up.
"If you keep his head up, he ain't gonna buck."
- Could I talk to you a minute?
- You bet.
"All right, you go ahead and take the rough off of him."
I'll come back after he's quieted down and put a handle on him.
What'll I do if I get into a real storm with this horse?
You said you were ready to come back to work.
- I am.
- Let me talk to that prick.
So what's the problem?
"Taylor is playing hardball, he won't budge on the price."
You assured me you could do this.
Do I need to send someone else out there who can make this happen?
"No, I'll get it done."
The clock is ticking.
- I thought you were his favorite.
- Things change.
Let me guess...
"Tall, brown hair."
How did you know?
"When things get stressful, Marcus reverts to his old bad habits."
What does that mean?
His wife.
Tall... brown hair...
"Really quite the beauty, until she wasn't, but I guess we all have our weaknesses, uh?"
- I didn't know he was married.
- Oh yeah.
"A long time ago, it didn't end well."
"Then again, what does?"
I have missed you.
I haven't thought of you once.
Maybe it's time for you to get out.
Maybe it's time for you to shut up!
Close the deal and get out.
"I will, I have to."
"What are you up to, Chase?"
I need change.
What do you mean?
GIRLS: * Face the music when you've got trouble
"* Face it, face it and you'll chase it far away"
"* Just face the music You'll make your worry hurry, scurry"
* Not a care will dare to stay
* The drums are drumming

* Joy is coming Coming for to make you gay
"* So blow the trumpets, bang the cymbals"
* When they start to play
* Face the music
* Play the music
* Every day's a happy day
(PANTING)
I want to march.
You can't march.
I want to lead the march!
"All right, march."
Fall in!
(DRUMBEAT ROLLING)
* Face the music when you've got trouble
"* Face it, face it and you'll chase it far away"
* Just face the music
"* You'll make your worry hurry, scurry"
* Not a care will dare to stay

"But the truth is, we don't know how long we have left."
Eric didn't know.
None of us do.
"You can play it safe, or take the chance and fight now."
These are some of the best men I've fought with.
We saw thousands die at Dunkirk.
Our orders were to hold the line to the last man.
And we did.
It was a suicide mission.
I'm not putting these men through that again.
I'm sorry.
I can't let them take that risk.
I asked to be taken to my POW.
Why I am still here?
Damn.
You know what?
I missed lunch.
"So, do you mind if I...?"
If you're done?
Mmm.
Luftwaffe silver clasp.
- Sixty missions to get one of those.
- I know what you want.
Yeah.
Gravy.
Why would I give information to an office boy?
Tell you what.
"I won't pretend to know anything about you, if you don't assume that you know me."
Don't usually flash that on a first date.
You ever been shot before?
No.
It's not much fun.
"Look, all I'm trying to say is it's not the same Natalie."
"If you knew her, you wouldn't know her."
"Last night after the show, she got somebody fired."
- Really?
"- One of the crew, the sound guy."
There were some wires on the floor.
She was like... complaining and
"I mean, I met the guy when I was."
He was a nice kid.
Now what's he gonna do?
What's he gonna do?
Wait.
Don't tell me.
"Sound engineer billy logan, right?"
My what are you doing here?
"My god, come in, come in!"
I can't believe this.
You've been taking pictures of me.
"Yeah, I thought I saw you."
I hope you don't mind.
"There was nothing on the web site, so I took a few candids."
They're for the next issue.
"Cast and crew after-hours, behind the scenes."
"While I have you here,"
"I have, well, a couple of questions."
It's not your lucky day.
What a shame.
Just a kid.
At least he didn't hit anybody when he jumped.
Are we sure he jumped?
"""Tired of losing."""
Not much of a note.
Bust that shit up!
Bust it like it's Dyson's douchey-ass face!
Yes!
That face is never kissing again.
- What else?
- We wallow.
Kenzi break-up mix on repeat all frigging afternoon.
- You have a break-up mix?
"- Dude, you have so much to learn."
Yes.
And then it's girls on the town.
"We're gonna burn this city to the ground, baby!"
I don't do that.
I'm not much of a party queen.
Drinking equals losing control equals someone gets dead.
"Yeah, but what a way to go, dude."
"Okay, fine."
We'll cut loose somewhere safe.
"You know, this is what I don't get, okay?"
"I did nothing wrong, and I'm the one whose day has gone to shit."
"For Dyson, it's like, ""Bo who?"" Totally unaffected."
Let's go.
Let's go.
We're gonna party.
We're gonna forget about it.
All right?
We'll see about that.
"Okay, this is me in the bar."
- And this is me going back to bed.
"- Oh, no."
We are not wasting hours of dress-up.
I don't care if I have to slather you with fairy dust.
Not in a good way.
"Said he's a vet, right?"
Afghanistan?
Maybe we crossed paths.
I don't think so.
I wonder what he saw out there that made him like this.
You get to the good part?
You made it a loop.
What do you mean?
Can we unloop it?
The detonator and booster can't be separated from the main charge without triggering the fuse.
Designed it special for hotshots like you...and me.
Anything that's put together can be taken apart.
And we ain't got nothing in common.
We'll see.
- Can you do this?
- Yeah.
He's a punk.
I got this.
All right.
Here's the plan.
"On three, you're stepping off that mine."
Got to do it cleanly.
Then get behind that blast wall.
- I can do that.
"- No, he's gonna need help."
He's been standing here for hours.
His legs are dead.
I don't need you.
"As soon as he's off the plunger,"
I can find the back door to this thing and defuse the mine.
Let's go.
"So his DNA is at a murder scene... and he's not the victim, so what does that leave?"
Is he a witness or is he just someone who happens to be there?
I'm gonna double-check the results.
"I'm gonna triple check them, okay?"
There's a possibility that the DNA is old.
20 years!
"I'm saying it's possible, okay?"
He may not have been there.
"Mark, just think about it."
It's Jesse!
- I know.
"- It means he's alive, yeah?"
"Yeah I know, you're right."
"I know, I know..."
"It's what we always wanted, isn't it?"
"Oh man, it doesn't make any sense to me."
"What am I gonna tell my Mum, Dad?"
"Nothing, not yet, okay?"
"Look, I shouldn't even be talking to you guys."
I could get fired.
Sorry.
This thing could end up being public.
I mean it's the sort of thing the papers have been all over.
"Yeah well, if it comes to that we'll let them know."
But don't you think there's someone else we should tell?
Someone who was with us that day.
Pru?
Come on.
"Dad, I wanna ask you something."
Do you remember him?
"This is Jesse, Dad."
You remember he went missing as a young boy?
It was my mom's.
Isn't she going to miss it?
She died before I was born.
I don't think that's possible.
"She died exactly when I was born, to the minute."
"Oh, I'm sorry."
You can turn around now.
What's this?
Did some rich guy give it to you?
Is it worth a million bucks?
No.
"Oh, did your mom give it to you, and then she died, and that's all you have to remember her by?"
No.
I stole it.
Oh.
T oo bad it's empty.
T oo bad you don't have a guy to put in your locket.
"A guy with a house, a job, a car, credit cards... and a son."
"Yeah, I know what you're trying to do, and it's not going to work."
"Well, what am I trying to do?"
You want me to go out with your dad.
"No, I don't."
That's good.
I want you to marry my dad.
Let me explain.
I never mix business with pleasure.
I'm not talking about pleasure.
I'm talking about you marrying my dad.
But people like your dad don't marry women like me.
Well...
"I told him what you did, and he didn't mind."
I told the truth.
What do you need to hide from?
Your life is perfect.
I'm serious. I would give anything to have your life.
My life is so pathetic.
You have this great house.
Parents that are there.
No one bothers you at school.
"Rickie, I need to talk to you about the gun."
Don't.
"- You can't carry a gun, Rickie."
- l don't.
Because it would be really bad.
Tragically bad.
"Angela, I don't carry a gun. I wouldn't even know how to shoot one."
But didn't Brian see you?
Isn't that what he's going to tell them?
This is really serious.
People are going to think you are dangerous.
I know.
That's what I want.
"So, what did happen?"
My cousin brought it in to sell it.
And I got real mad at him for bringing a gun into school.
"So, we got into this big argument..."
and the next thing I knew the thing fell out of the box and went off.
And he peed in his pants and ran away.
- He did not.
- He did.
Big stain.
And that's what happened with the gun?
That's the whole story of the gun.
And now Brian is going to say you did it.
It is my fault.
I should have worked harder.
Now she's gone!
She's not gone.
I know where she is.
Sit down.
How do you know where she is?
Now use your head.
She's a young girl.
She wants to party.
She wants to get wild.
Too late to leave the island.
Where is she?
Where's the only place she could go?
"Eden East, the singles' side."
We gotta go get her.
You're damn right we do!
And I'm going with you!
I am not letting you go alone!
I don't care if I have to go there all night!
To find Trudy.
We're gonna go find Trudy for him!
"We can't even go to that side, all right?"
"And it's gonna get very dark, very soon."
Plus we have to be in bed...
What are you talking about?
Listen to me.
We have to be to bed at a very reasonable hour tonight because we cannot miss the sunrise in the morning.
"Now, Marcel said if we miss that sunrise, we will not be completing our course."
"We are here for the course, all right?"
- Yes.
"And stop eating and drinking, as well."
"You did her, and now you've come to see what it did to me?"
"- I love her out of pity, Mickey."
"- Don't you, by chance, pity me a little?"
- I love her out of sorrow.
"- Me, I love her out of full stop!"
- She respects you.
- Like one respects graveyards.
I'll never leave her to you.
It's to have you in her mitt that she took that mad flat just across from yours.
"Yes, you did your bit to waste the Venom."
But there's still three to go in her noble cause.
You up for it?
Now it's you she'll run away from.
Mickey isn't the brute you believe he is.
I don't have beliefs.
It...
It's tough to hurt you.
"For me to be able to kill you, you need to be a woman."
I'd wrap the blade in silk.
You wouldn't feel a thing.
No.
She would.
Buzz off!
Oh no!
"We are such children, prince."
Mary...
See?
- D'you suffer?
- D'you?
Our clients!
"Right on time, like for church!"
"Hey degenerate, you got Gothic mosques at home?"
Let me ask you one last time.
Let us go.
You can call me an obsessed hypocrite if you want... but I can't let you go.
You never loved me back.
I thought things would get better if I held onto your empty glances... but you never thought of me the way I cherished you.
"If I can't have your heart, then I'll keep your body at least."
You'll stay with me until I die.
(Downtown Magok)
How did it go?
I found a merchant who trades with Puyo.
He's at the tavern.
Let's go.
I work for Sosuhno.
You want to buy seal fur?
Yes.
You're late.
Mr. Oh from Haengin bought all we have.
I heard the pirates smuggle seal fur.
I'll pay you handsomely.
"Let me meet Buwiyum, the pirate captain."
You can't meet him unless he approaches you.
Help me.
That's him.
Step back!
I want to see your captain.
I don't want to fight.
Lead us to him.
Mr. Yu in Magok sent them.
They have a letter from him too.
I'm Buwiyum.
You want to trade with me?
"I'm disguised as a merchant... but I'm Jumong, Commander of the Damul Army."
You might as well.
I'll be grand.
I can always slip downstairs.
"I was so embarrassed, I was scarlet."
"I'm not joking yous, I was burnin'!"
How are yous?
- Go on.
"- How are you, Sharon?"
He was holding the eclair in his hand like this.
"The place was full, and he says..."
"""Why did you rob the cream out of me eclair?"""
"- The head on him, Jesus!"
- And did you rob it?
"Well, I paid for the bleedin' thing."
Why shouldn't I have?
I told him to cop on.
"""I seen ya,"" he says, ""with your finger."""
So I gave him the finger.
I'd shag the elephant man before I'd let him near me again.
The prick.
"Here, young fella!"
"Give us three vodkas, two cokes, and a glass of Furstenberg."
"Have you got that now, chicken?"
"Hey, handsome, give us a packet of crisps as well, will ya?"
And do you have any nuts?
Whoo!
You dirty bitch!
I'm only messing with you.
He's a nice little bum on him... like two eggs in a hankie.
"He'll be nice-looking when he's older, won't he?"
Are you going to break it off with him anyway?
Yeah.
Have a spot?
Rather.
"Excuse me, sir."
"I wouldn't touch it if I were you, sir."
"Too watery, sir."
"Besides, it'll rust in the lining of your stomach."
- We'll be the judge of that.
"- Wait, sir."
There's a fly.
- I don't see a fly.
- Neither do I.
"There it is, sir."
It just dove under the ice.
I'll get the little nipper in half a jiffy.
I got him.
Hear him?
Humming like a beehive.
He's gone.
Ain't that a shame?
There he goes.
"Come along, Mitchell."
I think we'll forget the punch.
"Tommy, you know we have Sgt. Higginbotham to thank... for your being let out of the expedition."
That's right.
The Colonel says I'm the only man sharp enough...
- to replace Sgt. Ballantine.
- That's very flattering.
"I'm only glad to be so some help in, shall we say, Cupid's service."
"One thing I can promise... with Cutter and MacChesney about, you won't have one dull moment."
I've got a feeling they don't like me very much.
It's just as well.
"- The army's no place for sentiment, I says."
"All right, well, I would try to go to Applebee's with you."
"Well, I would try to go to Applebee's with you!"
So let's try.
I want to try!
"Well, let's try!"
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry that it took all of that.
But you know what?
"Now I can honestly say, with love in my heart' that you are my man."
Could you ever love me again?
"Well, you're my wife."
And I never stopped loving you.
Now come here and give me a kiss.
This next jam goes out to all you party people in the house!
"And that time that you got sick, you didn't want me to see you, so you locked me out of the bathroom?"
No!
Then I passed out!
Yeah.
And you called the ambulance.
"Well, because, before you passed out, it sounded like you were dying in there."
You know?
I thought I was dying.
I did.
"Yeah, well, what was I supposed to do?"
I should have broken down the door.
You've been a really good friend.
You have been the best friend in the world to me.
"Now don't stop dancing, y'all!"
Party ain't over!
It's far from over!
"Silence, please!"
- Mm-hmm.
What the dog do?
Spit gold dust?
He's the best dog you've ever seen.
He could pull that load of yours without any help at all.
- Sure!
I'll bet you he could.
"- Well, he could."
"How'd you like to make a little bet on that, partner?"
Haven't any money to bet.
I hear of one dog in Nome... he pull 800 pound.
But he dies dead to do that.
"Ah, no dog can pull 1,000 pounds."
It's impossible.
"Well, then it's impossible."
Let's drop it.
"Is it all right to look at him, mister?"
It ain't every day we can see a dog that can pull a thousand pounds.
"Come on, boss."
Let's get outta here.
"What's the matter, gentlemen?"
If I overheard correctly... the argument is whether or not this dog can pull a thousand pounds.
I'm willing to bet a dollar a pound he can't.
He won't bet.
Says he's broke.
"I don't want money from you, my friend."
"If your dog is able to do it, I'll give you the $1,000."
- If he can't-
- Well?
"Why, then, I'll take the dog."
No.
"Say, that sounds fair to me."
I don't know you.
Mujik.
Let go of my arm before I get mad!
I heard that you have a friend in the detention facility at the
Royal Repository.
I must see Chun-su.
Can you get me in?
You're the one who put him there and now you want to get him out?
I'm begging you.
What are you going to do?
Break him out of jail?
I'll find a way.
"And if that's the only way, I will break him out."
Now that's a joke!
What do you think you're doing?
!
"If I can just talk to him, I know I can find some kind of evidence."
Get up from there?
A nobleman can't kneel before a peasant!
A friend's life is at stake.
I don't care about status.
I have no excuse for what I have done to Chun-su.
But you have to know this.
Chun-su is a friend I treasure more than my own life.
Stop right there?
"Hey brothers, what are you still doing here?"
"Mujik, is that you?"
What are you doing here?
I told you to fetch the brothers!
Do you know this boy?
"Oh, he's a new kid that just joined the gang."
What are you waiting for?
I'm sort of a workaholic.
So you're a pro.
You can put it that way.
"Now, let me examine you first."
Sickness in the heart means that the left ventricular heart has a problem.
"To put it into exact terms, going down from the collarbone, passing by the diaphragm, meeting the third nerve cell."
Here.
How do you feel?
I feel hot all over.
I knew it.
- What happened?
"- It's gotten hard, you see."
Am I going to die?
You won't.
Then what shall I do?
I should set it free.
It'll get serious if you hold it in.
Wait!
Since when have humans become so scary?
You said it would be a piece of cake.
"You're the one who always said that, not me."
So then?
Are you trying to point fingers now?
How dare you speak to me that way?
Damn it!
I got you!
Damn it!
How dare you strangle your father...
Dad!
- Dad?
- What?
"Sir, I didn't intend on this."
He treats me like I'm a fucking fag.
I got to go on the lam to get away from this guy.
This ain't right.
I can't go here or there.
I talk to them a million times.
They don't listen.
he'll stop.
I'll wind up being declared M.I.A.
They'll find me in a car in the weeds.
You've known this Tommy all your life.
This cocksucker's an arch criminal.
When I leave my house in the morning I look over both shoulders.
This is no way to live.
I'm no fence jumper.
I'll do it.
What could I do?
I would.
I'd like to help you out.
Tell him what we talked about.
take a piece of this joint.
It'd be good.
What are you talking about?
You mean the restaurant?
It's a classy place.
You've been in here a million times.
Tommy taking over this joint is like putting a silk hat on a pig.
but that's the way it is.
I'm begging you.
What can I say?
What am I going to do?
What does he want from me?
I don't know anything about the restaurant business.
* cry

Get out!
Mrs. Brendan?
Yes.
You wanted to see me?
"Yes, I did."
"The, uh, girl said it was urgent, Mr..."
"Uh, Hoolick."
I'm Wilbur's father.
"Oh, how nice to meet you."
Do sit down.
Thank you.
I hope our keeping Wilbur here didn't inconvenience you.
"A little, but it's going to be all right."
When did you want to take him home?
"Uh, now."
No.
But why?
Are they doing this to spite him?
Could be.
Why?
Maybe they don't want him to be strong.
I'll tell him he has to be strong.
I'll hide in there and they won't find me and I'll spend Saturday with him.
"No, we won't go in now."
"We brought him his things, we'll give it to the guard at the entrance."
I want the guard to tell Daddy that I came to see him and to give him a kiss.
I'll write him a note.
"You're the witch and I'm the prince, okay?"
The princess too.
"You're the princess too, okay."
"No, you're the prince and princess, I'm the witch and all the guards."
Then the prince came.
"- Look, look."
"Hi, Alex."
I can't get a hold of you.
"I left you messages at the theater and at home, you haven't called me back, so I'm trying again."
Please call me back.
It's Ora.
Thank you.
"So, my child?"
I know what you're going through.
It's as if we're losing the ground beneath us.
Dear God.
Do you need money?
"There, there."
"Dinner is ready, and stop with your secrets."
"You're not alone, so stop whispering."
Two weeks and still nothing!
- And now?
"- l promise, within three days."
What if it doesn't happen?
She seems to be better now.
Her son left yesterday.
"If she'd been in a bad way, he wouldn't have left."
How do you know that?
We just know.
It's not something you can hide from us.
"She's better, this is useless."
You say that you know but you know nothing.
"First of all, her son is a guard at Kermanshah."
He's gone back to warn his boss.
It's 45 miles away.
He can be back in a day.
"If we want to go to Tehran, it's 450 miles away."
"450 miles, understand?"
We have to go to Tehran.
450 miles in one day!
"We didn't say we'd come back... lf no one decides for us, we have to decide for ourselves."
I can't decide for you.
You decide.
I can't decide.
God's the one who decides.
Who drew up this shooting?
I can't strangle her!
What am I supposed to do?
We're not asking you to strangle her.
What then?
How much longer do we have to stay here?
What if the event never occurs?
Be careful.
Means you are not shooting me?
I had to shoot.
But not with gud with boom.
Make a boom which blast.
"Bring the beg like he put in that locker, and we will put boom in it."
And after that we will exchange there bags.
Then we will have 900000/-.
And he will have the boom.
And by pressing the remote.
How can i do this.
I don't know how to press the remote.
He is big rascal.
He is trashing him with boom to have his money.
You stuff has also trash by him.
Should i shoot him right here?
Will we trash him in his style.
Means with boom?
Yeah.
And now there is no tension of getting same to same bag.
Really Bhai you have.
What?
Bag Bhai (brother).
This boom can blush even by touching hand.
What shall i do?
Put it in this.
"Now let me go, let me go Papa."
Papa?
"He is saying Papa just like us, Papa."
Papa we should took on photo.
"Sir, what are you doing, it will blast."
"Sir, do you also want to put bag in safe deposit."
Modified it how?
Not in a good way.
"Said he's a vet,right?"
Afghanistan?
- Maybe we crossed paths.
- l don't think so.
I wonder what he saw out there that made him like this.
You get to the good part?
You made it a loop.
What do you mean?
Can we unloop it?
The detonator and booster can't be separated from the main charge without triggering the fuse.
Designed it special for hotshots like you...
And me.
Anything that's put together can be taken apart.
And we ain't got nothing in common.
We'Il see.
- Can you do this?
- Yeah.
He's a punk.I got this.
All right.Here's the plan.
"On three,you're stepping off that mine."
Got to do it cleanly.Then get behind that blast wall.
- l can do that.
"- No,he's gonna need help."
He's been standing here for hours.His legs are dead.
I don't need you.
"As soon as he's off the plunger,I can find the back door to this thing and defuse the mine."
Let's go.
"All right,on three,you're hauling ass."
"One,two..."
Three!
"Well, I think it's way too soon to start packing up our desks."
Come on.
You know he's gonna bring in his own people.
"No, we don't."
we haven't even met him yet.
He might want to keep things intact.
Seriously?
And not clean house?
He's throwing out merc's toilet.
Mm.
Stop it.
We need to stay positive.
I have a good feeling about this.
You do?
I don't.
"Well, I really do."
I am so fucked.
No way this guy isn't gonna clean house.
"Well, you haven't even met him yet."
I don't need to.
It's what I would do.
But you're brilliant at your job.
Why wouldn't he want to keep you?
Because I'm brilliant at it.
"Okay, you know what you mean, but..."
You never want someone who can do your job better than you can.
Why do you think I've got Andy and myra?
"Plus, if this guy finds out they offered me the job before him, forget it!"
Fucked!
"Normally, at this point,"
I would try and be encouraging...
"Yeah, no point in that."
"Although, all of you will have to be out of here by then."
- Where should I go?
Should I make myself invisible?
- Well I think It's cool here...
"No doors, wild."
"Tell me, how did you find this place?"
"Angie, three schnapps, and no objections!"
"Okay, my last offer... 150 per show, and only if it works."
Why wouldn't it work?
You never know.
And what happens if it doesn't work?
God damn it!
Don't you start up again with me.
Yes or no?
I just want to have it cleared up.
This guy's got an issue earning money.
"He's in debt, fiddles around on his show for a year  lives from nothing, and he gets stuck on the fine print."
Thanks.
"Alfons, you're my uncle."
You can't do anything about that and neither can I.
"I'm sorry to say this but  every time you get an opportunity, you blow it."
He's got a point.
Fuck you.
I think we got him.
"Ah, a tent!"
I haven't gone camping in a while.
Fine.
We got a lot done today.
"Got a lot done, but for what?"
For what?
Well good night then.
Can I sleep here?
But maybe he's what we need to mix with our blood now that we've lost belle Reve and have to go on without belle Reve to protect us.
"Oh, how pretty the sky is."
I ought to go there on a rocket that never comes down.
"Which way do we go now, stella?"
This way?
"No, hon, this way."
The blind are leading the blind.
Red hots!
Are you going upstairs and tell her to cut that out?
"If I go up, I won't come down."
Let's just forget it.
Remember that night she poured boiling water through them cracks in the floor?
I gotta go home pretty soon.
"-Come on, what do you say?"
"-No, I'm out."
"Every time you win a big pot, you're out like stout."
I got a sick mother and she don't go to sleep...
-...until I get in.
-What do you say?
I'm gonna wash up.
-stella?
"-Yes, Eunice?"
You tell them guys the kettle's on the stove.
I'm gonna break up the game.
-What did she mean by that?
-She'II pour it straight through the cracks.
"stella, wait."
Wait till I powder.
I feel so hot and frazzled.
-Do I Iook done in?
-You look as fresh as a daisy.
One that's been picked a few days.
And then see if you can hold it.
"Otis, you've got to be kidding."
What if I can't stop it?
"Well, then I'll get a really good look at what happened."
"Yeah, you stay right there in case I need you."
"Well, of course."
I was gonna do that.
"I'll be right there by your side, OK?"
"Ah, ah, OK."
All right.
That's good.
[Sighs]
"Well, I guess you're right."
He should have been able to stop it.
One thing I can't figure though...
I
Can't see how the car would push them into the street.
"Yeah, well, I don't know."
Wait a minute.
"He could've slipped, right?"
He falls back as the car rolls forward.
"Uh, could be, I guess."
RICHARD:
It's got to be the way it happened.
The driver... he won't swear he saw anybody push him.
OTIS:
"No, he won't swear."
"Well, come on."
I guess we better get this heap back to the pound.
"You know, it's a damn shame this thing's got that little old"
Whine there in the rear end.
I always sort of imagined myself had a little old car like this.
Sit down.
You can't punch the leader.
"You are not a leader, okay."
You're a fuck up.
You've always been a fuck up.
I need you to calm down.
"Okay, we need to figure out a plan before that sick fuck comes home."
What about the skylight?
That's like 25 feet up.
"Even if we stand on each other's shoulders circus style, we won't be able to reach it."
We tried that already.
Text.
I thought you said the signals are blocked.
"I'll just ah, hit send and throw it to the skylight."
"It's a signal jammer, okay."
"We find the jammer, we kill it, then we call for help."
"Look, it's a new plan guys, all right."
"You guys, you sweep this are out here for the jammer,"
Blair and I will take the bedroom.
You don't tell me what to do.
Can you wait for me?
Riley.
Yeah.
Hey.
"I need you with us, okay."
We gotta find that jammer.
He's right.
No.
I'm a fuck up.
"No, you're not."
We all make mistakes.
"Look at me, I'm in deep with Timmy Song, right."
Great job.
That's all for today.
"All right, well, great."
Yeah.
How did we do?
Did we do good?
"I mean, are we gonna make it?"
"Well, you know, it's just our first session, you know."
We're not looking for an end result here.
It's not a competition.
"I get all that, but have you seen couples that are worse off than us?"
Yeah.
Or are we that far gone?
We're...
Are you gonna put a...
Like a numerical value on it?
"You know, Doc?"
Like a one to 10?
"One being worst, 10 being best?"
"No, hang on one second."
Where would you put us?
"Right where you are, sir."
"What if someone put a gun to your head right now and said,"
"""You have to answer this second or I'll shoot."
"""Are they gonna make it?"" What do you say?"
What would you say?
Whoa!
"Okay, no one has a gun to my head, Mr. Smith."
It's hypothetical.
It's not a place for inappropriate behavior.
And you definitely don't pull a hypothetical gun on your therapist.
Sorry.
Why are you singing that...?
"Oh, my God."
You just had sex.
"No, I didn't."
I was peeing.
I thought I made that clear.
"No, no, no, no."
That's your sex song.
You always sing it after you... perform your act.
"- No, I don't."
"- Yeah, yeah."
"Who are you talking to, buddy?"
I was there.
"When we were married, I heard it many, many times."
And then not so much at the end.
"- All right, so I had sex."
- Yep.
Christine and I have been dating for over three months.
You can't be surprised.
"Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm not surprised."
"I mean, I never really thought about it."
"But, hey, if you want to jump into the sack with the first girl who comes along, be my guest."
Be... my... guest.
"Actually, she's not the first."
"Right after you and I split up, I got one under my belt."
"""Under your belt""?"
"What are you, a pirate?"
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have brought it up.
"Obviously, you haven't had any and you're a little..."
"Anyway, it's nothing to be ashamed of."
"We've been divorced for two years, which means you haven't had sex in... just over three years."
Yeah.
"Of course, the liver."
"Come on, boys, belly up."
Toast to us.
"Uh, derek and tommy, I'm gonna pour you guys a little shot of ginger ale since you're girly boys who can't handle your booze."
"To us, gents."
"To, uh, garbage bags full of cash."
To liver cancer.
- Here.
- Cheers.Bam.
"Let's go, boys.The strippers aren't going to shove dollar bills between their own jugs."
"You know, you guys go ahead.I'm gonna stay and, you know, close up shop, take care of the money."
"No, it's ok, I got it."
Don't worry about it.
"No, no, it's fine."
I got like a place where I hide it.
"It's very secretive, you know."
"Yeah, well, I'm gonna keep it at lou's place."
So it's not a big thing.
"All right, but I know how to retain it and everything.It's my job."
"- You know what I mean, it's my job."
- It's not your job tonight.
I got it.
Ok?
- You got it?
- I just said I got it.
Ok.
"All right, you got it."
You guys go ahead.
Have a good time at scores.
All right?
"And, you know, I can give you guys a couple of tips that will actually help you guys out there."
Who would like to speak to Senor Juan?
I have some papers for him to sign.
He's with a client.
You can leave them with me.
"Sorry, but I have instructions to bring these papers back with me, signed."
"You can wait, then."
- I don't need the Internet.
- You think you don't need it.
"- I don't need one of those, either."
- Soon you'll say you don't need man.
"Well, for the last two years."
Two years?
No man?
- Or the Internet.
- The best place to find a man.
What ever happened to dinner and a movie?
A guy who spends his nights in front of a computer has to be a good date.
"He's not married, and he doesn't sleep with a lot of girls."
Maybe there's a reason he's not married.
Maybe there's a reason he doesn't sleep with a lot of girls.
Maybe... he's not even a man.
How do you say...?
- Don't knock it till you've tried it.
"- Yeah, that's it."
Tonight come by my house and we'll go into a chat room together.
- I don't think so.
- Tonight.
Promise.
- We'll see.
- Okay.
I'm sorry.
I thought it was a robbery.
How much longer?
Not much longer.
"Look, I need to get Schmidt into this freezer."
The drugs work better if he's cold.
Come on.
We got one shot at this.
You want to do it right?
Well?
Do you want to do this or not?
Get in!
What are you doing?
!
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
We don't have a lot of time.
"I can get you out of this, but you have to do exactly as I say."
I'm going to inject you with a drug --
I already don't like this.
"Shh, shh, shh!"
"When I do, you have to resist for a moment and then tell me where you hid Jabbar's ex."
No!
No!
Do you know what he'll do to her if her finds her?
!
"If we pull this off, the last thing he'll be worrying about is his ex-wife."
T-t-this -- this drug -- w-w-what does it do?
I don't think you want to know.
"Hey, you know what?"
I'm sick of being the last guy who knows what's going on!
"Now, what does the drug do?"
It's going to paralyze your entire body and stop you from breathing.
I-I-I didn't need to know that.
I am gonna go to work.
I am just gonna straighten up.
Just a tad.

"Oh, you just scared the hell out of me."
"Sorry, I wa..."
"I was just, um, I was... nothing."
"Ah, that's a... nice heels."
Oh!
"Yeah, uh, my feet were hurting, so I... same reason I never wear mine."
What?
"Uh, forget it."
"Hey, did you hear about the underground show?"
"Apparently, they've got some big name spinning."
"Oh, you mean like a rave?"
"Oh, is it still a rave if you don't roll?"
I just call it a party.
"But hey, I got a friend who can hook us up with tickets if you're down."
Want me to get you one?
Yeah.
"Yeah, great."
Yeah?
"All right, cool."
"Um, it's Friday, so..."
Looking forward to it.
Yeah.
I'm not supposed to tell anyone.
"Come on, anyone who ever says ""I'm not supposed to tell anyone"" is always dying to tell someone, so tell me!"
Why do you wanna know?
I can't tell you that.
- Don't say that.
"Without you, I would have no reason to live."
"But with you, I can handle anything."
I'll find Martina.
I'll get her to confess.
No matter what.
Have faith.
You'll see: we haven't lost yet.
"For the love of God, hurry up!"
I'm not risking my life for 20 Scudi.
I think I heard a woman scream.
- You hear women everywhere...
I'm sure I'm not mistaken.
"Well, I didn't hear anything, so let's go back to our quarters."
Let go of me.
"- If you scream, I'll kill you."
What did I do to you?
What do you want from me?
I know you told the judges that Beatrice paid you to let me into the castle...
Why?
It's not true.
You lied in court.
Who paid you?
"Tell me, or I'll strangle you."
"Shout if you want - you're the one they're looking for, not me."
You're finished.
All I have to do is call them.
You're right.
I'm finished.
"Thanks to you, they think I'm a murderer."
So it won't cost me anything to twist your neck!
Who paid you?
", you know what?"
No respect around here.
That's why we're not Making big gold right now.
I don't really now How to river mine.
Can't be that much Different than the ocean.
Suck it all up.
The kougarok river Can Reach depths of 6 to 8 feet.
"But at this river bend,"
Kris will brave depths of...
Less than three.
Wearing a wave belt when he's In The water that's 2 feet deep.
Just get down and dive!
"Okay, I'm sorry, But."
How's it looking Over there?
"It looks good, Lots of red sand."
I want the gold Not the garnet.
"Keep going, jay, You're going good."
It could be A good day after all.
Really fine gold here.
"Okay, Keep sucking it up."
"I got to say, jay,"
That is the fastest You've ever found gold.
"Dude, I'm not even trying, And there's gold."
I told you!
I told you!
"It's gold, it's gold, it's Gold!"
"Okay, not gonna lie, We didn't exactly know."
Where to go in the beginning.
But it turned out great.
I think all of our hard work Is gonna pay off.
I told you!
I told you it was good here!
Of course you are.
This is it.!
"Let go of the girl, Hammond!"
What are you doing?
Let's keep going.
"Look, Natalie, if I had things my way... you'd be the girl I'd run away to paradise with."
But I'm gonna be your hostage.
"Natalie, it's over."
I can't let you ruin your life because of me.
- I think it's time for you to go home now.
- You can't mean that.
"You know, until yesterday... the worst thing I ever did in my whole life was cheat on a biology exam."
"And now I'm a car thief... a kidnapper... cop-shooter, police-evader."
I can't do this to you.
I can't make you part of this anymore.
I care about you too much.
"Besides, I can't hold you hostage anymore."
We ate the gun.
But you have the real gun.
Uh... real guns make me nervous.
I do better with the candy ones.
"Jack, you're innocent."
We can make this work.
You...
You're really something.
You know that?
- Thank you.
- For what?
For believing in me.
"Let the girl go now, Hammond!"
"It's been a hell of a ride, huh, kid?"
"What say you, uh... step out of the car and walk away from me?"
Smearing you across the front pages is not enough.
Scum like you shouldn't be allowed to live.
You're gonna die.
"Stan, stop it."
Stop it.
Help him.
He'll kill him.
I can't believe it.
I'm rid of him.
It's perfect.
We just call the police and tell them it was self-defence.
Are you crazy?
That's the one thing we can't do.
But why not?
He was trying to kill you.
I'm a witness.
Shut up and listen.
Connie will take care of it.
You just go home.
Do whatever it is you'd normally do.
Just act as if nothing happened.
"When he doesn't come home tonight, call his brother, ask him where he is."
"When he says he doesn't know, act worried."
"Don't call the police until 2, maybe 3 in the morning."
Tell them anything you want to except that he came here.
You understand?
What are you gonna do with him?
He'll just disappear.
"Police will look for him a few months, then give up."
"Now, come on, get out of here."
Take his car.
"After you've gotten rid of him, drive out to the airport, leave the car there."
Come back.
The company needs you and...
And so do I.
"Oh, you mean leave here?"
"Oh, I'm afraid Dr. Croatman would have something to say about that."
"But you're so much better, John."
"You've had a long rest, and you look wonderful."
"Don't you think if the psychiatrist examined you again, he'd see that?"
He does seem rather pleased with my progress.
"Oh, good!"
Then I'll tell Sam about it.
He'll know what's best to be done.
"If you wish, my dear."
But I'm not sure it'll do any good.
Stop pacing like a caged animal.
What if they don't let him out?
Why shouldn't they?
There's nothing wrong with him.
I know.
But you can go off your rocker just being in a place like that.
"If it doesn't work, we're finished."
"If it does, what about you and me?"
We just have to be careful.
"Mrs. Brown, Dr. Helck is here."
I've just come from Dr. Croatman.
"My dear, John is waiting for you to bring him home."
Wonderful.
"Well, it was a great 10 months."
This isn't the end.
We'd better go in.
We won't be able to see each other.
We can't pull this trick again.
What's the matter?
"Well, we're having a little trouble with these drills here."
- No more spares?
"- No, they're all shot too."
"Well, turn them in and get some new ones."
"Frank, these drills cost money."
- We gotta be more careful.
- Yeah?
You asked us to speed it up.
You better get some drills that will stand this gaff.
They'll stand up if they're used right.
Maybe you can use them better.
"Yeah, and so can you."
- Did you check your setting?
"- Yeah, it's all right."
That's tool steel.
You're giving her too much feed.
"Come on, boy, you're too good a guy for boners like that."
- I see that greaseball's been picking on you.
- Yeah.
How's it feel being pushed around by a honyock?
I don't like it.
I ain't gonna stand for it.
No?
"What are you gonna do, take a poke at him and lose your job?"
I'll take a poke at him and I'll get another job too.
That don't worry me none.
You were a long time getting this one.
"Weren't you, Frank?"
Yeah.
"All right, then."
Why don't you get wise to yourself?

Said he had a plan that would get him out of the mob.
I guess he was wrong.
They found him.
What did my brother mean to you?
Everything.
Take me to his place.
I want to get to know him.
Take you to his place?
Are you crazy?
You show up and start this mess that almost gets us killed.
"You don't have a clue who you're dealing with, do you?"
"If you wanna kill yourself, be my guest."
But who gave you the right to risk my life?
I can't go home.
I can't go to work.
You painted a big red target on my back.
Where's the check?
Mikhail used to say we could never stay in one Place too long.
We have to move all the time.
It's time for us to move.
- They'll find us here.
- The cable didn't have to die.
This is just the beginning.
I've seen it before.
"They won't stop until you're dead, too."
You can't go to the police.
You can't hide.
"Lvan and his boss, Kirov, are relentless."
"All right, I'll bring you to your brother's home."
This explains why Mikhail picked a bank in Nice.
Holy shit.
Looks like we got another chance.
- I'd lay dead just like you're gonna do.
- You would?
Sure.
"Always remember, don't be a sucker."
I'm pulling every string I can.
I'm seeing the right people.
- I can get you off with about three years.
- You talk like I can do it in a handstand.
That ain't no picnic.
You'll be outside having it soft on cushions.
It's tough.
I'm not gonna mark time.
"I'll scout around, make connections."
"- Not only for me, for both of us."
- Why should I take the fall?
There's no other way out.
Be sensible.
"If they get me, I'll be disbarred."
They'll check my vault box and grab the 100 grand.
"You don't want to lose that dough, do you?"
"All right, Frazier."
"It's my rap, and I'll take it but it's my 100 grand, and I'll take that, too, the day I get out."
Look...
"I know you're a smart lawyer, very smart but don't get smart with me."
"Very good, boys."
That's all.
"Wait till I get you outside, mug-face."
I'll immobilize you.
Yeah?
You and your old maid!
Come in.
"What's on your mind, son?"
"Instead, you'll go with Jimmy."
You come with me.
Have a good time.
Sit in the sun.
Take a couple days off.
We'll have a good time.
"When you come back, you'll go back to Karen."
"Please, there's no other way."
No divorce.
We're not animali.
No divorce.
She'll never divorce him.
"She'll kill him, but not divorce him."
You going to pay us?
Just give us the fucking money!
I can't.
I swear.
Let's go.
We'll throw the bastard to the lions.
Lions?
"I ain't going near any lions, Jimmy!"
Just throw him over the moat.
I'll get the money!
"They must really feed each other to the lions down there, 'cause the guy gave the money right up."
I'll get the money.
We got to spend the rest of the weekend at the track.
They mean business.
"Then, I couldn't believe what happened."
"When we got home, we were all over the newspaper."
At first I didn't even know why we got picked up.
Then I found out the guy we roughed up had a sister working as a typist for the FBI.
I couldn't believe it.
Let's get clear of this god-forsaken place.
Let's go!
We need to drink.Please.
Make it quick.
What are you doing?
It will keep you cool.
We have been pursued.
Let us go.
Now!
You're going to leave us here?
"I could make my life a lot easier and return you to jacob moore, if you would prefer."
"Soon as we clear the rocks, boom the main sail!"
Give her everything she can carry.
This ship's mine now.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Get him!
"Take the wheel, boy!"
This one's for me.
You fight like a man with a lot to lose.
But I have nothing to lose.
Which makes me far more dangerous!
"First blood, I think."
"So, the evil island spirit."
"You're going to attack me with a stick, are ya?"
"I have a very, very unfair advantage."
"Oh, well we'll just see about that."
Die!
"Hold the wheel steady, boy!"
While I finish him off.
You see?
I have been living the outdoor life.
"Fresh air, plenty of exercise and nutritious food."
"I had it for you, only as I said, I didn't expect..."
- I know.
You said it before.

"In the meantime, I suppose you'd like some spending money."
"Here, here's 500."
I'll take that.
It'll take me a few days to get settled.
"By that time, you can get that dough together and tell me where I come in."
Where you come in?
What do you mean?
"What business you want me to handle, what parts of town and what my cut is."
- Your cut?
- Yeah.
"That was the idea, wasn't it?"
"I took the rap, three years."
"You took the dough, made connections, built it up."
For you and me.
Wasn't that it?
"Oh, I see."
Yes.
I understand but you've got this thing all wrong.
"See, I work for Keefer."
He's the boss.
I haven't anything to say.
"If you want a spot in his business, why you'll have to take it up with him."
"Now, look, Frazier, I'm not taking it up with anybody but you."
You figure it out for yourself.
I'm taking up with you where I left off.

"Eggbeater, Eggnog, Egg-brain?"
Egg salad?
Good one.
Ha-ha!
"Winston, this thing between us is getting out of hand."
"I play a trick on you, you try to get me back."
The anger we're building up here could scar us for life.
"Here, let me get that."
Sit.
"Now, as I was saying,"
I think we should try to live together peacefully.
"You know, let bygones be bygones."
"Have you suffered a severe trauma of the head recently, Bruce?"
What a kidder.
"Right, Manny?"
Yeah.
Truce?
(snorts)
This is nice.
"Hi, guys."
See ya.
"Whoa, Eggman, she wants you."
You think?
Yeah.
Go talk to her.
*(fabric rips)*
"What's the matter, Egghead?"
Butt too heavy?
"Aw, gee, empty."
Someone must've spilled glue all over the bench.
"Tough break, Eggplant."
So?
"I see. "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
""" Go...go...go...Govinda. """

Case on God admitted.
"Paper, paper, paper."
High Court has put it's seal on it.
Through the notice prepared by advocate Hanif Qureshi.. ..Kanji Lalji Mehta's case on God has been accepted.
I think he's mad.
Who is this guy?
"Hey Jigna, what happened?"
"See, his wife ran away."
Who can live with that madman?
I don't even talk to him.
Or the Lord might punish us as well.
What a splendid bike.
"- But, who is he?"
I think he arrived just last night.
Who's playing this classical music?
I've heard that the new guest is really handsome.
Don't I look handsome?
Get inside.
"Hey, Hari Prasad."
"Hey, Chaurasiya."
What's all this?
I was waking up the birds!
What?
Who?

I was practising.
It's a good thing to do in the morning.

Kate:

Matt:
"We're a hundred metres underground, what do you expect!"
(Console alarm sounds)
James:
The radiation levels are spiking.
The shielding's not in place when the maintenance tunnels are open.
Matt:
Well why the fuck not?!
James:
This shouldn't be able to happen.
Connor: ...Shit!
Connor:
We've got less than two minutes and we're fried.
We've got to get out!
Kate:
What about the people in the tunnels?
Matt:
What about us!
James:
Fuck!
James:
It's locked down!
Connor:
"James, calm down and think."
How do we get out?
James:
We go into the service tunnels.
Matt:
The tunnels?!
"Hairy is the word that's just, I just picture his forearms, and being like, where are you?"
JULlE KLAUSNER:
I don't mind that.
BETH HOYT:
"I could, I can French braid."
I'd love to try a fish tail braid on his arm.
That would be fashionable.
"OK, you guys."
We are minutes away from open comments.
Anything you've ever wanted to ask Julie or
"Ted, now is your chance."
Put them in the comments.
We'll be right back.

"Who, hyung?"
Why did that guy come here?
"Now, you even sleep out?"
Ah!
"Baek Go Dong, are all the guys here?"
I detest waiting!
I think the guys are here.
Hello! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Subtitles brought to you by The Maid of House 2 Team @Viki.com&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;

"Uh, did you come?"
Who said you can use our practice room without permission?
So what?
"Man Ok, keep doing it."
This... this is totally cool!
Aren't you practicing?
"All right, I'm leaving now."
Practice.
Go ahead and start.
Where are you going?
Go to the toilet.
Why didn't you come yesterday?
I kept waiting.
That is... something came up.
But I went there at 11 p.m.
Huh?
I was at Playground (Bar) at that time.
That's strange.
I waited till midnight just in case.
Where?
On the swings at the playground.
"Can you pass me a spoon, soul roll brother never would?"
"Lights up, please."
"Come on, now."

JULlE KLAUSNER:
You went to high--
"You went to high school with Camille Grammer, didn't you?"
"-Wait, let me finish."
- Absolutely not.
No way.
-Why are you so worked up?
- Fools...
Don't I have a say in this?
Forget it.
No.
I have a guy already.
"A blind date is the best present, right?"
Really?
You have a boyfriend?
You do?
"115 00:14:46,652 --&amp;gt; 00:14:47,209 Wow..."
"He's cute, isn't he?"
"Yeah, he's good-looking."
How'd she meet a guy like this?
"- They look like a good couple, huh?"
- Right.
"Hey, Sister-in-law!"
Stop!
Stop!
Wait a minute.
Time out!
"Looks ridiculous, huh?"
- It was a mistake!
"Coach, save me!"
- You're dead meat!
"Come here, you bastard!"
"Get over here, you bastard!"
It was a misunderstanding!
The ministry of education requested proper courtesies regarding cell phones.

"So, Russ, looks like we'll be working some long hours together."
It'll be my pleasure.
"Well, that's a start."
Jessica and Lila got on and I didn't?
There must be some mistake.
Maybe you should talk to Mr. Collins.
"OK, news team, come get your story assignments."
Go on.
I will.
Go get your assignment.
I'll be fine.
"You did an exceptional job, Jessica."
Go!
Father.
"Canglong, are you an animal?"
Lingerh.

Shut up.
"If I get angry,"
I'll eat up all your hearts.
Canglong.
We're guests here.
How could you be so rude to Miss Zhong?
Down.
Wake up.
Where are we?
Caught by the Yellow Robe Man and brought here.
Right.
"You've sucked up the Red Python's blood, and you're endowed with ""Red Dragon Soul""."
Climb up and look around.
"Maybe you can break the top, and we can escape."
I'll try.
The cover is very strong.
I can't break it.
Senior.
Is Tuan Zhengchun coming for his children?
Of course.
I've brought them here... as bait for Tuan Zhengchun.
Chief Zhong has a giant gorilla in the chamber.
"After it has eaten Tuan Yu, it will be a very powerful beast."
No one can fight it.
Not even the Yi Yang Finger... can tackle it.
We can get rid of his whole family.
Only then I'd have vent my anger.
Do you remember what he looked like?
About 35.
Dark.
Nice-looking.
"Uh, thanks."
Thanks very much.
A boat would be too slow.
Check out the airlines.
Right.
One of them has a booking for Gus Priamos.
Find the person who sold him the ticket and make an identification.
See that your men have pictures with them.

You've got pictures of Kimble.
( dramatic theme playing )
I keep thinking about it.
Keeps coming up in my throat.
"Ah, you think too much."
"If Gerard wasn't there, where is he?"
Someplace.
What do you care?
"He's going to get a message from the captain, he's gonna come running like crazy."
And he's going to be late.
And you're on your way to Greece.
You're on your way to Greece.

Have you seen Caesarian?
Where is he?
Have you seen the child?
Where's the child?
Out of my way!
What're you doing here?
Your Queen needs you on guard!
Where's the boy?
"He's not here, by the blessings of lsis"
Not here?
What do you mean?
"It doesn't matter, he's safe"
"Listen to me, Mardian"
Caesarian is in grave danger
That's not it!

Speed up!
I have to go quickly and wash it off.
Sauna!
Sauna!
You can't go home right now.
Why?
Tae Ik hyung-nim

He kept saying he won't let you go if you are late.
Seriously!
I said speed up!
"Anyway, the one that came out best..."
I think is this one.
What do you want?
I don't expect anything big.
The commercial that Won Kang Kwi is shooting again.
"If you hand it over to me, &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;I'll keep my mouth shut."
Just for a commercial you go through all this trouble?
"At a cheap motel, with a guy partner..."
Isn't the combination extreme for a Hallyu star like Won Kang Hwi?
Type in a new card for Elizabeth.

Bruce Patman.
"Thank you, Jess..."
"*I mean, Elizabeth.*"
Where's his card?
It's coming right up.
"*Hello, fellow Gladiators.*"
"*And as if you didn't know,* *I'm Bruce Patman,*"
*and this is* *the Patman perspective...*

I'm really sorry.
This has to be done.
What did Collins say?
I have to talk to the principal.
Can't say you don't deserve it.
"Hey, nice move back there."
You really got me.
"Yeah, I did, didn't I?"
I'm impressed.
You're a nightmare.
*But I say there's nothing wrong* *with having money.* (Patty) Winston!
*I love the way money feels.* *I love the way money smells.*
I love what money does for me.
Radha's alliance is fixed with Jimmy!
There's a call from Singapore.
Talk to him.
Hello!
Yes!
- Hello!
"- Mr. Singh, Jimmy here."
Did you receive my marriage invitation?
"Yes, I did."
And I'm the happiest person to see this card.
Shreekant is not only yours... ...but my relative too.
"That's why I fixed this alliance, partner."
"You are coming to Bombay, right?"
"Not only me, all of us will come in your procession."
Along with the band party.

And I also want to see one more relative.

Jaikishan!
I came to know everything.
"You want to drink, right?"
Go on... drink... drink more.
You came to know?
Drink more.
I'll drink...
I'll drink more and more.
So much that all my blood will get vomited.
Fuck Prince.
"Because it would have like, doves and sheer scarves."
TED LEO:
"I think it would anti-climactic, you know?"
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Well, no-one's going to climax."
I feel like there would be a lot of whispering.
TED LEO:
"I feel like there would be all this lead up to it, and then you'd actually get down to it--"
BETH HOYT:
"And he'd just be like, missionary, and it would be over?"
JULlE KLAUSNER:
"Yeah, right?"
TED LEO:
Yeah.
"And he's really little, you know."
JULlE KLAUSNER:
He is really little.
BETH HOYT:
Cee-Lo might be the one to have sex with.
TED LEO:
That's what I'm saying.
BETH HOYT:
Because he's a giver.
"Do you watch ""The Voice?"" He really, like, is into, I think he might give just the right amount."
"Like, not Sting give, but--"
JULlE KLAUSNER:
I would do what I had to do to meet that cat.
That white cat he holds on that show.
BETH HOYT:
That's what he's saying.
What?
"Yes, I believe we are."
Close friends...
It's hot!
Then can I ask you a favor as a father of your friend?
"Yes, of course."
"Got 30,000 won with you?"
"Just 30,000 won."
Pardon me?
I saw a pair of sneakers perfect for Ji-hwan.
"I'm short 30,000 won."
I'll pay you back right away.
Can you lend me that money?
Sure.
Thanks a lot!
"I ask you as a father of your friend... keep this a secret, okay?"
"Yes, a secret!"
Quiet!
I worry about you and your life.
Not everyone can become Jackie Chan.
Heard from somewhere that he fell unconscious five times and has metal parts all over his body.

Anybody here who'd like to know the day of the week they were born?
We can do it that way.
"Of course, I could just make up an answer and you wouldn't know, so I come prepared for that."
I brought with me a book of calendars.
"It goes as far back into the past as 1800, because you never know."
(Laughter)
"I didn't mean to look at you, sir -- you were just sitting there."
(Laughter)
"Anyway, Chris, you can help me out here, if you wouldn't mind."
This is a book of calendars.
Who wanted to know their birth day?
"What year was it, first of all?"
Audience:

66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966.
And what month?
Audience:

Jesus Christ.
They crash our pub.
- They put your brother in the hospital.
- That ain't your problem.
What are you talking about?
I've got just as much at stake as you.
"Matt, listen to me."
It's time to go home.
I don't know where my home is anymore.
I think we both know where it ain't.
"Mate, this is my fight."
It's my brother in the hospital.
I'll take care of Tommy.
"Go home, mate."
I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air
They fly so high
They reach the sky
And like--
"You're doing the right thing, Matt."
Yeah.
"You know that back home, nobody's gonna care about your rep here."
"You know that, right?"
I'm gonna call a cab.
- Where's Matt?
- Finally went home.
Come on.
"This is Charlie-27, MPCP-501, at Brixton Road."
Disturbance...
The cab's on its... ...way.
You seem jittery tonight.
You never know who's coming.
"Ladies, five minutes."
Five minutes.
How'd you do that?
"Work out, plenty of rest."
"You know, eat your green vegetables."
Thas what my mom is always saying.
I just never actually believed her.
Come on.
Go.
Keep it steady.
Is a web.
"Go, Spidey, go!"
We got trouble!
Get me down!
I am more than content with what Mr. Moncrieff said.
His voice alone inspires one with absolute credulity.
Then you think we should forgive them?
Yes.
"I mean, no."
Hey.
Hey.
"Hey, chief."
"You park there, I'm towing it."
Whatever.
Shoelace.
You might want to...
Can I help you?
"Yeah, I've come to see the show."
"Oh, I'm sorry, sir."
No one will be seated after the doors are closed.
When did you return?
Years passed in your waiting.
"Sister-in-law, look who's standing in front of us."
Till now we had seen him just in a photo.
Today we saw him personally.
Who... - We're... - Mr. Jimmy.
"You know inspector Damodar Mathur, right?"
Just shut up!
Talk about Radha.
- No!
Wait!
I'm Damodar's wife.
- Damodar?!
"Oh, sister-in-law!"
"Hello, sister-in-law!"
- Hello!
How's Damodar?
Few months before he wrote me that he... ...is very fine and become fat now.
"You are very naughty, son."
Letters must be sent by Radha... ...and you are talking about Damodar?
"Right, sister-in-law?"
He's trying to fool us.
"This isn't right, son."
You came to India but you didn't inform us.
Radha has gone mad.
- Radha?
"Yes, our Radha!"
- What?
"So, are you surprised seeing your in-laws, Mr. Son-in-law?"
Now let's go home now.
- Home?!
Radha will be happy.
How do I explain to him?
Yes.
"Watch, watch."
"Look, this is you."
And this is Mala
And this is..
And this is me.
Here's your money.
I would prefer dying.. than do this.. with Mala.
Kishen.
Kishen.
"You're trying to ruin my life, Kishen."
Kishen!
If you make Mala fall for you. ..then I will give you 5000 rupees.
I had a wager with my friends that you can make Mala fall for you.
And if that happens then I will win the bet of 10000 rupees.

Oh... sorry.
Amy:
"Listen, I'd better go."
I've got a lot of work to do.
Amy:
(Sighs) I'm so tired.
I can't even think about work right now.
Amy:
I hope he doesn't expect me to remember anything.
Dr. Niven:
Ah Lisa.
Did you finish your talk?
Lisa:
Yeah!
Just in time.
Dr. Niven:
I had every confidence in you.
Amy:
Did you get a chance to look at my simulation?
Dr. Niven:
Ah yes!
The problem with the supersymmetric parameter lattice...
Dr. Niven:
I think I found a way to express it differently.
Dr. Niven:
I didn't implement it in my analysis code yet but you might like to try it.
Amy:
It looks more complex though.
I don't know if it'll work on my laptop.
Dr. Niven:
"Well, we'll deal with that later if we need to."
Amy:
When daddy has put the incense in here.

The first thing Sasha's doing is getting the water hot to put a hot cloth on his face.
Sasha:

"Does he have, like, a nice, warm face now?"
Sasha:
It's always been hot. man:
All right.
Yes.

-For the swingers party.
"I thought we were choosing up, like draft picks."
No?
-No.
"That was a joke, Steve."
BETH HOYT:
"OK, open comments is coming up as soon as I get your questions in for Ted and Julie in the chat."
"First of all, you didn't think we were going to spend half an hour with Ted Leo, and not get him to perform a song for us, did you?"
"What are you playing for us, Ted?"
TED LEO:
"Uh, I'm, I don't need to talk into this, do I?"
BETH HOYT:
Do it for fun.
For effect.
TED LEO:
I am going to play a new song that is yet untitled for now.

"What are you talking about, Marla?"
"Your husband, Barry.... my ex-husband, Barry..."
"Denise, Barry's a selfish bastard."
What?
No!
"No, he's not."
No.
Look.
-Oh my god.
-Mm-hm
This is not happening.
He fooled me too.
There were always signs.
What signs?
Think about it!
Haven't you ever been stuck out in the cold with him?
"I got pneumonia once, but..."
You got lucky.
I lost a finger.
Frostbite.
Think about your last birthday.
Happy Birthday to you!
Mmm!
It's spongy.
Selfish bastards can't participate in the celebration of others.
It's been documented.
No!
It's not true!
He loves people.
He was so close to his brother and sister.
Selfish bastards recreate the past for personal gain.
- Let's break up.
"-Why, Sook-hyun?"
-We've made it this far.
Just...
- This card is maxed out.
Find a better woman.
Can you put these back on the shelves?
Sook-hyun!
There's no better woman for me.
Don't do this...
Cut it out and get lost!
I'm sorry
Attention please.

Will you go in and see Mom?
Don't worry.
They said she's fine.
SMS from Lee Jin Woo
Meet me at the Sky Lounge today.
"Hello, Hello."
"Jin-woo, if you're off duty, then act like it."
Forget this and go start a fire in your girlfriend's heart
Okay?
See you.
"Hey, be careful!"
Where is it?
Please let me find it.
The gap in performance at elementary schools is rising.
"Now, today's weather forecast."
"Due to the high atmospheric pressure from the southwest, the heat wave..."
I only bought the fish!
From where did you buy the fish?
"I bought it from my boss""s company truck.. ..that delivers fishes everyday."
I am so sorry! - so sorry!
"Hello, shekhar!"
This is for you!
Thank you very much!
Bye-bye!
Bye!
ls she the girl who dropped the beer?
Why did she come here? she came to apologise!
- Apologise?
And in this room? she is a mad girl!
And she left a present for you.
lf she had got it for me.. then why did she give it to you?
"Darling, we are in Europe!"
You should have a generous heart.
"I don""t understand anything, shekhar! on the first night you left me alone."
And now.. now this girl came in our bedroom.
What does this mean?
This means that you doubt me!
"You are making me doubt you, shekhar!"
"I don""t know why I feel afraid."
"Now unnecessarily you are scared. come in the bedroom! oh God! ln the morning, bedroom!"
"ln the afternoon, bedroom!"
"At night, bedroom!"
Always bedroom!
I am fed up of this place!
"Let""s go home, shekhar!"
Please!
Are you really fed up?
"- Yes! okay, darling!"
1 1 O'clock.
And that guy must still be snoring in bed.
"Get up, it's morning. . . . ."
"Get up, it's morning."
"You have come, that means it's morning."
Don't recite poetry.
"Get up, you have a meeting at 1 1."
Okay!
What's the time now?
- 12 O'clock.
What!
"For a 1 1 O'clock meeting, you wake me up at 12?"
"Don't worry, one hour late in India is okay."
Nonsense!
Now I know why our India has not progressed.
Why?
If wives like you wake up their husbands like me an hour late. . .
India will never progress.
"God, why doesn't London have such wives?"
Why is she screaming?
- What happened to her?
She was shocked.
- Shocked?
Why?
Look down.
My pajamas got left in the blanket.
- Wear them quickly.
God !
"Go take a bath quickly, the water will go."
Why take a bath everyday?
"It's a waste of time, water, soap."
My complexion won't change even if I take a bath everyday.
"Uh, it's, uh..."
Wait a minute.
[laughs]
A stupid question.
"""What day is it?"""
Ah.
Sorry. woman:
Okay. man:
It's 24 July.
[laughs]
woman:
And what a day it is. man:
It's the best day ever.
woman:
You might be wondering why I'm up at this ungodly hour.
"Like others, I believe that the time between 3:00 A.M. and 4:00 A.M. is one where the veil between this world and the next is the thinnest."
"Often during this time of the day,"
I hear the sound of my name uttered by an unseen presence.
[dog barks]
[rooster crows]
woman:
Good morning.
[woman #2 speaking native language] [woman laughs]
man:
Whoa.
[laughs] [speaking native language] That's nice.
man:
And here we go into the garage.
That's right.
We're going to ride in the elevator.
All right.
Let's ride it.
"What's this, dad?"
What's wrong dad?!
What's this letter?
This is an expulsion letter from school
You skip classes?
"Dad, that was when I was in 7th grade"
Oh
And that was a while ago?
You ditched school?
You failure!
Dad it was a very long time ago
No more allowance! and no more Belila (Egyptian food)
I don't like it
Help me Sameh

Smart and clever and always studying really hard

Day before yesterday.
10 am.
From Hiranandani to Andheri Station.
"Yes, I sold that ticket."
What's written behind it?
He paid me with a five hundred note.
I didn't have change.
So I wrote it on the back.
"He forgot to take the change... hey, it must be him."
Who...?
This one always forgets.
"Sometimes he forgets to buy a ticket, sometimes it's the change."
"At times, he'll go on buying tickets."
He keeps on asking the names of bus stops.
Can you recognise him?
"- Why not... looks a strange sort, keeps his head shaven, has a long scar on the head."
"Every morning at ten, he takes the bus from Hiranandani."
It's nine.
We got an hour to get him.
Come on.
Take camera
Bus 392
There he goes.
Hey...
Damn it.
See you in the canteen after the lecture.
"Excuse me... excuse me, sir..."
Hi sir!
I'm Sunita.
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la, la"
Holy shit...
No i met her in a butchery.
Oh yeah totally..
May i help you?
We'll be asking the questions old man
Who are You?
YU!
"No, not me..."
You...
"Yes, I am YU..."
Just answer the damn question!
Who are you?
I have told you!
Are you deaf?
"No, YU is blind..."
"I'm not blind, You blind!"
That is what i just said!
You just said what?
I did not say what i said YU!
And that is what i'm asking you!
- He says he doesn't.
"lf you look at just my feet, I look at least a decade older... probably."
- My feet are really ugly.
- Right.
It's a joke.
None
Yesterday after filming in Las Vegas
I went back to hotel and slept 3 hours.
So I'm kind of tired right now...
But it's a night in Vegas.
The night is young.
I'll get myself together again.
It's my turn now.
It ripped.
None
Does this even show?
This is called reality.
"I have a lot of parts in ""Hurricane""."
It's a fun song.
It's a fun song but we're dressed like this.
So I should act more gentle...
With class!
Shouldn't I do that?
During overseas tour
We always set a goal as a team.
"lf B.A.P ever gets a vacation, Las Vegas is definitely on our list to visit."
It's over.
My eyebrows move too when I sing.
Thank you.
It's over.
I'm done.
Since I was young
- ln demonology -
- Hey so that you could make it - [ Moans ]
"- - You're really makin' it --** - Hon, can you tell Vic to come on down for supper ?"
- [ Screams ]
Holy shit !
- Shh.
You know there's no lock on your door ? - -- [ Humming ] - [ Moaning ]
-- [ Continues ]
Ohh !
I'm coming !
I'm coming !
-- [ Humming ]
"- Oh, Jim !"
- Dad.
"Hi, I was just looking at the old family portrait out here."
"Well, that was a fun day wasn't it ?"
"- Oh, yeah."
- Yeah.
"Jim, I want to talk about masturbation."
"Now, I just want you to know that it's-it's a perfectly normal, uh, thing."
"And I have to admit, uh, you know."
I did a fair bit of masturbating when I was a little younger.
"- I, uh-- I used to call it ""stroking the salami."" - [ Groans ]"
"Yeah, you know, ""pounding the ol' pud."""
I never did it with baked goods.
But you know your Uncle Mort ?
"He ""pinched the one-eyed snake"" five, six times a day."
"See, it's like, uh, practice for the big game."
You see ?
It's like-- It's like... banging a tennis ball against a brick wall.
Which can be fun.
"It can be fun, but it's not a game."
Yes
CL:
It's scary.
I think it's scary.
CL:
I'm a little nervous about how it will go in front of huge numbers of audience.
CL:
I don't know how I will act when the cameras are turned on.
I have no idea.
I am so nervous that I hardly sleep at night anymore.
KL:
There are still some steps...
D:
A waltz by Camilla and Kristjan
D:
Thank you.
D:
Well Dermot.
DC:
"If you had the nerves, I couldn't see it."
"To be a premiere dance, this is perhaps one of the best I've seen through seven seasons."
DC:
It was elegant.
You have a very nice position.
"And if I should criticize anything the first night, it is to breathe more and get the head a bit more....."
CL:
I didn't breathe at all
DC:
Think about it to next week.
You have to dance and breathe.
"It was a very, very good start."
D:
Look forward to it!
Bong Joon Gu's first piece of work!
Bong(?) Dumplings!
This is called Bong Dumplings.
Inside the dumpling there is another dumpling.
I made it after getting special permission from your father.
I'm not sure if it turned out well.
I have one for Father too.
Try it and please critique it.
I was waiting so long for you to come home.
Yeah.
"But, what to do?"
I already ate dinner.
Really?
You already ate?
"Ah, what a waste."
Dad.
Oh.
That...
You did quite a good job on the shape.
Does it really look like that?
"Father, try it once."
This is kind of embarrassing and I'm nervous.
Oh.
Joon Gu.
There... um....
We decided to move back into Seung Jo's house.
"It's a bit uncomfortable here, and kind of hard on my back."
And Seung Jo's family wants us too.
We just decided to do it that way.
Just know that.
Okay?
"But strangely when I just look at Hae Ra, my mind goes blank."
Nonsense just comes out of my mouth.
And I wonder if a guy like me looking at Hae Ra is just unfulfilled longing.
Why?
You do have charisma.
I know I have charisma.
But strangely in front of Hae Ra...
"Then, did you confess to Seung Jo?"
I had written a love letter before.
Letter!
"Wow, why didn't I think of that?"
Letter.
"Aigoo, you should never do that!"
Hae Ra is like a girl version of Baek Seung Jo.
"If you write a letter, you'll just embarrass yourself."
Just look directly into her eyes and confess.
Girls like that the best.
I can't even look at her right.
What do you mean look her in the eyes?
Why?
You can practice.
Here.
Just think that I'm Hae Ra.
Should I?
That won't work.
Why?
You can practice.
Just try it again.
How can I imagine you as Hae Ra?
You try.
I'm Baek Seung Jo.
Try it.
I have.
Why?
Then today is tomorrow!
Today cannot be tomorrow.
"Tomorrow will be in the future, and we are in the real time."
And the future is not real?
It...
It is make-believe?
"The future is real, but..."
But?
"But, but, but?"
It will come later.
When?
Soon.
And I think it has already come.
"What do you mean, it has come?"
When?
"What do you mean, it has come?"
"What has come, my friends?"
The future.
Where?
Everywhere.
Today's morning it is already tomorrow.
Really?
It can't be that today is tomorrow.
Yes?
"You mean, today is yesterday?"
Yesterday is over.
"When yesterday ends, starts tomorrow."
Then the day after tomorrow.
Then two days after tomorrow.
Then...
Why do you want to know my bra size?
Huh?
- I never knew Su-eun was so dirty-minded.
- Get away from me!
Happy birthday to you!
"Happy birthday dear Su-eun, Happy birthday to you."
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!
"-Okay, in one shot!"
- One shot!
One shot!
One shot!
Bottoms up!
Bottoms up!
My present?
You want more?
"My present, my birthday present!"
You think I'm still a kid?
These are really popular these days.
Then you wear it.
We spent all day looking for this.
Just keep it.
"Quiet, both of you!"
You're so loud I can't understand anything.
Let me speak too.
What's his problem?
"Sister-in-law, I'll give you a better present than this."
How about a blind date?
Really?
With who?
"Well, in my station, there's..."
"No, No firemen."
Letter to Santa.
"""Dear Santa, I have been SO good this year..."""
You know what?
No!
"No, I am not listening to any more of this!"
You're just jealous!
Long term exposure has compromised your ability to judge.
There is no way I am married to a selfish bastard!
(SMACK!)
"Focus, Denise!"
Think about all that you have sacrificed.
How could I be so stupid?
"Don't go there, Denise!"
You deserve so much more.
I do?
"Denise, you deserve oral sex."
But... he said that was...
Impossible.
That it's just...
A scam.
Can't he get help?
No.
It's terminal.
"If he were a loser or even a prick, maybe..."
NOOO!
I hate G-d!
I hate Christmas!
Pull yourself together!
Denise!
NOOOOO!!!
Your life is in danger.
Earthquake!
They're the goons who wants you...
Dacoits?
- Yes.
In helicopter?
- They're rich dacoits.
They move on by helicopters.
By swear!
I see.
Father were also talking something like this.
My Radha!
"Sister-in-law, why are you scared?"
Brother Shreekant has personally gone to look for her.
He'll arrest that rogue in no time.
Jamna!
Bring my Radha back.
That's it.
My Radha...
"Yes, sister-in-law."
She'll definitely come back.
She'll definitely come back.
But God...
In which condition?
I just can't think over it.
That young boy and young girl...
And she'll be all alone.
And that too in a jungle!
Wonder what he must be doing with her.
And Radha is so innocent.
She doesn't know anything about this world.
She's so innocent.
- What will happen with her?
- Aunt!
Theresa:
[scoffs]
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."
Aah!
[romantic music continues] man:
"Well, so here's the deal."
"Uh, I asked her if she wanted to go on a romantic date with me sometime, and she says, ""No."""
Just--just no.
That's really all she said.
"Just ""no."""
She didn't want any of that.
"Ever, possibly."
"Never, ever."
"And so, uh..."
"Well, actually, I said,"
"""What about the possibility of a possibility?"""
And she said-- She said no to that.
No possibility.
None.
woman:
"Okay, let me say that it is meant for women to kneel down."
"For example, a woman is supposed to kneel down for a man. man:"
Mm-hmm.
Do you want to show us how you do it? woman:
Yes. man:
"So you greet Moses, like, traditionally."
[Moses speaking native language]
man:
Wow.
Wow.
"Moses, how do you feel about it?"
Let me go!
Please!
More compresses.
Is he stable?
It looks like he's responding.
"The doctor told me not to call the police, but to keep you here for the moment."
I'm better now.
"I need some coffee, please."
"One, two, three..."
"One, two, three..."
Third discharge.
"One, two, three..."
He's gone.
Doctor!
Mom?
"No, I was awake."
"Yes, I know I said we'd take a plane this week but..."
Pablo can't talk.
He's... asleep.
"Mom, hold on."
Listen.
I want to read you something.
"""Manuel Leonardi was a writer and journalist."
He wrote stories.
His wife Amalia... studied fine art but quit her studies when she became pregnant with her first child.
The last thing Amalia painted was her daughter's bedroom.
"She painted it blue with colored fish."""
Her daughter's name was Andrea.
"A beautiful name, isn't it?"
Nothing to say?
"No, not now."
"We'll talk again later, okay?"
I was so freaked out.
"(Finebros) So, do you know what that game was?"
No.
Skinny?
Slim?
"I mean, it said ""Slender"" in the front."
"- ""Slender."""
"- ""Slender."""
"""Slender."""
(Finebros) And how do you know about this game?
- I heard it on YouTube.
- On the Internet.
"Someone was, like, tweeting about it."
"(Finebros) So, have you ever played the game before?"
- No.
- No.
- No.
- No.
(giggles)
- No.
- No.
"No, and I resisted playing it till this day."
- Yeah.
- It's my third time playing it.
I have played it on my phone once and didn't sleep for two days.
(Finebros) And what is the purpose of the game?
To scare you.
To scare the living (bleep) out of you.
I don't know.
You told me to find a piece of paper.
"To find the eight pages, which I failed miserably."
(chuckles) (Finebros) And how did it make you feel when you were playing?
Come on!
Cut!
Okay.
Are you Ok?
Is everything alright?
Except for blood on my chest.
"Yeah, right."
It's the winter.
Once the ice stabs the bones he realizes that he's alive.
Nice!
What a line!
"Dad, you're a novelist now?"
"A novelist, that's really off the wall."
Can't recall the things you've done.
"Uh, a truck driver... a cabaret singer..."
You and your samba... a dance instructor... a month at acting school to become an actor...
Remember that?
"Hey, stick to what's going on now."
Dwelling on the past... not a manly thing to do.
"Sir, I came for visit."
"Hi Dal-rae, welcome!"
"Hey, what's up?"
This is Ji-hwan's dad.
"I'm MOON Young-hoon, Ji-hwan's classmate."
"Ah, so you're Young-hoon..."
"Sir, bought some soju and squid for you."
How many?
The fridge is broken so put them in cold water.
Yes.
Do you drink?
"No sir, not really."
You're cringing.
"She comes, and she kneels down every day?"
Moses:
"Yes, because I'm a man."
She has to respect. woman:
It's the culture.

How are you?
I'm good.
"I'm still-- Yeah, I'm in New York."
"It's--Yeah, it's been really hot here, but I'm having fun."
"Uh, anyway, I wanted to call you, because, uh, you know my friend, uh, Nick, that I-- that you've met a lot..."
Yeah.
"Yeah, I know."
He's a very nice boy.
Uh...
"Well, I wanted to tell you that he's, um, not-- not just my friend."
He's--he's my boyfriend.
"Um, and it's something that I've wanted to tell you for a while, but I wasn't really sure how you would react, so I was a little nervous to tell you."
Um...
I-I love you too.
Yeah.
I love you too.
"And I'm hoping that-- that maybe you can love Nick too, um, because he's really important to me, so I'm hoping he can be really-- really important to you too."
Yeah.
"Well, that-- that means a lot to me."

"Goal by number eight, Chris Ostreicher."
- Nice game.
- Nice game.
Good game.
"Hey, what are you doin' here ?"
Just enjoying my first exhilarating lacrosse experience.
- You kicked butt.
"- Oh, thanks."
"- Um, Chris-- - Oh, you can call me Oz, if you want."
- Do I have to ?
- You can call me Ostreicher.
- What's your middle name ?
"- Nah, forget it."
- Come on.
I won't tell anyone.
"- Well, neither will l."
Okay.
Um.
"So, I had this thought and--"
It may seem like it's way out of left field.
"I don't know if you can, but since I'm not going with anybody, I thought that maybe--"
Those guys sucked ass !
"Not for your complexion, but you stink."
Go quickly!
Prepare my breakfast.
- I am.
"Lado, get my shampoo."
"If I give him the whole bottle, he'll finish the whole bottle."
He will keep shampooing himself.
"Whatever he does, his complexion won't change."
Get the shampoo.
- Coming !
"The cat is troubling me here, and the husband troubling me there."
Everyone troubles me.
What all do I manage?
"The water has gone cold, get the shampoo!"
Coming.
Take.
- Coming.
Why do you give me the shampoo in a bowl everyday?
Am I a beggar?
"Take a bath, but not in excess."
- Damn !
What shampoo is this?
It stinks!
"Was this shampoo, or egg?"
I'll benefit only if I serve him.
"Lado, my body is stinking of egg."
Smell me.
An egg shampoo will smell of egg.
Now eat.
Okay.
Will you eat?
Is it good?
Sing it with me.
You know the words.
"No, thanks, man."
You've been singin' that shit all week.
"If you try that at M.S.U. this Saturday, I'll kick your ass."
Our last game is this Saturday.
[ Snickers ]
"Yeah, well, shit."
I've got this lacrosse game.
It's really important.
It's our last game.
"Central almost beat us last time, so this time I really wanna kick their ass."
"But it's gonna be cool, because the game's at State, which means afterwards I'll be able to stop by."
So you can't sing at the competition.
[ Sighing ]
"Heather, I'm sorry."
I totally blew it.
It's okay.
You should... do what makes you happy.
All right.
"Listen, thanks for understanding."
Yeah.
"So, uh, I guess I'll see you later ?"
Mm-hmm.
[ Whistling ]
"Hey, Kevin."
- You seen shit-brick lately ?
- Why ?
What did you do to him ?
Me ?
Nothing.
"See, I'm the one whose ass he kicked."
Choose.
Jackie Chan or Taekwondo.
I can do both well!
Fine.
Ten more laps then.
Master!
Said you gotta do both.
A National is only two weeks away and you're 3 kg over.
Pick up the speed!
Another weight loss?
Don't get me started.
Go get me some water.
Ji-hwan...
"You're losing weight to avoid facing Young-hoon, right?"
Think what you like.
"As I told you before, my goal is not winning a Gold but to graduate."
He will only bring her back.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
So what have you decided?
I will bring her.
Not because I love her but since I need money.
Money?!
Money is not a problem.
Tell me how much you want.
I will ask after I get her back.
Gave me one cigarette.
"Sir, cigarette."
"Hey, why are you thundering like that?"
Could you not remember me all these days?
"Anyway, now that you came, stay here for some time."
The both of us can play together.
Ha Ni went to school already.
We know.
We just thought about So Pal Bok Noodles all of a sudden.
Seafood noodles?
With a lot of fresh raw oyster.
"I got it, i got it!"
Over here!
Two seafood noodles with a lot of fresh raw oyster.
Ooh!
Bong Joon Gu!
Sounds like it's your territory.
"Super charismatic, huh?"
"Right, huh?"
Should I buy Ha Ni a pair of glasses?
"Everyone else says I have charisma, but Ha Ni is the only one that doesn't see it."
"Joon Gu, if you're too pushy, Ha Ni will just get bored."
What...what did you say?
"Bong Joon Gu, you really don't know women."
Do you know why Ha Ni can't stand up against Seung Jo?
Because Seung Jo is cold.
What?
Cold?
"To women, if a man is far away, they want to get closer."
"If they come towards us, we want to run away."
Is that true?
Yeah.
"If you keep it up, she'll dislike you more and more, Bong Joon Gu."
"No, no."
Chef kept talking about being sought after!
So I tried it out...
But it does not really fit the personality
"And I can not play, For hard to reach."
"Ah, semi-retired."
"You're trying to get out of taking me to dinner, aren't you?"
Just want to be honest.
No secrets.
Ok.
Then tell me how you survived getting hit by a truck.
Your injuries were fatal.
Was it vampire blood?
"That, and, uh..."
This ring protects me from death at the hands of supernatural beings.
A vampire hunter who can't be killed by vampires.
Convenient.
Are you worried I'm a supernatural being?
One can never be...
Too careful.
"Oh, um, hey, um."
Sorry.
"Oh, uh, I'm gonna go."
"Ok, yeah, sure, sure, sure."
"Elena, I am..."
I'm sorry.
"Please, it... it's ok."
"Ah, it's not ok, Elena."
"I mean, this is not even my place."
It's... it's your place.
It's Jenna's place.
It's your family...
It's your family's place.
"The minute that you slept on that couch, it became your place, too."
"We needed you, and..."
And you stayed.
Sp thank you for that.
"Hey, Gypsy, you can't hold anything but a guitar."
Going to take it into battle with you?
His horse will wield the sword for him.
Ajugful of vodka for me!
"Come on, son."
"Here, hold my hands, guys."
"Hold his hands, come on."
I'll not have you breaking my cups!
"Away, you anti-Christ!"
Vodka!
Quick!
Give me another one!
"Come here, Ksanka."
"Good day to you, Uncle Sidor."
- Do the men bother you?
"- Oh, not at all."
Poor orphan.
I've brought you a present.
- You like it?
- It's lovely.
"- Wear it, if you like it."
- Thanks very much.
Go now.
- Anybody been to see her?
- Not a soul.
- Did she go out?
- No.
"If anything happens, I'll skin you alive."
She makes out to be innocent.
But I know she's connected with them.
They'll show up any day now.
"You see anything suspicious, let me know."
"Banu, see what you did to us."
"Read it, further details in the paper."
- Go on read it.
- Okay Güney.
You thought I could be the murderer.
You accused me in your head.
You didn't believe me.
But see what happened?
The truth has come out.
You accused me for nothing.
Was it worth it?
But you were talking in your sleep.
You said it yourself.
Honey...
"Look, it was only your imagination."
You gotta admit that yourself.
Stop doubting me.
Erase the suspicions in your mind.
"Don't do this to us, if you want us to be like before."
"Please, if you wand to get well, my dear."
I am sorry.
I know I upset you so much.
I am sorry.
"- It's okay, canım."
- I'm sorry for everything.
It's okay.
Okay.
Barış did what is expected from him.
"When he felt cornered, he pulled a victim out of his hat."
- How did you know I'd be here?
- Your assistant told me.
"Melda, we need to talk."
Make him drink
Drink
He'll come to when he vomits it
Play me?
You're and impostor
I'm genuine， you're an impostor
I have bad odor.
Come and smell it
It's strong
He's an impostor.
Go and get hold of him
You haven't smelt me yet
Paul， you smell it
Well， no smell?
Lisa， you know my secret.
Say it
Right， you say it
Landal's hair is a wig
Right
You're great
Lisa， what secret has he got?
No， this is all I know
Lisa， I didn't want to tell you
When I was a child.
I saw a bitch die， survived by a puppy
I pitied him and lifted him up
He was so hungry he bit off my teat abruptly
The left one is artificial
And you?
The right one， not the left
Wrong， the left side
Right side
I'll go prepare her food before she comes.
She didn't look tired at all.
She was outside all day.
She went to the jail with Sami Amca.
- Jail?
"- Well, I was there as well."
That's how I saw her.
- Good evening.
"- Good evening, how can I help you?"
- Gülten Hanım?
"- Yes, it is me."
"I am Münir Erkut, lawyer."
I told Barış all I had to say.
I don't want anything from him.
I have no demands.
All I want is to divorce as soon as possible.
You didn't have to come all the way here.
I think there's a misunderstanding.
I'm not an attorney to the person you mentioned.
I am Kazım Gencerel's lawyer.
My condolences.
I had not told my daughter about it.
My condolences.
Your father wanted me to give you something.
Please come inside.
Gülten Hanım...
- Do you want me to stay?
"- No, Hüseyin Bey."
Thank you very much.
Come.
"No one from the mansion comes here, right?"
"Don't worry, no one can disturb us here."
- What are you guys doing here?
- Get lost!
Go on!
"- All right, all right!"
"- Dima, let's lure it out."
- One moment.
Stand back.
"Kosmos, get him!"
- He's done for.
- You fail.
"- All right, hold the latch."
Now!
- What did you do that for?
- Kostya?
- Attention!
Listen to this information.
Tomorrow is Parents' Day.
"Tomorrow, my friends, we need to aim for record heights."
Yes.
In being disciplined...
In being orderly...
In being talented.
- Who's missing?
- Inochkin.
- Fill the gap.
"- So, what about talents?"
- I've got three.
- From the entire troop?
"Don't tell me there are no talents among you, my friends."
"Sorry, I don't believe that for a moment."
"- Half a meatball, everyone."
"- And if you can't sing or dance, you can recite a poem."
I think.. you have gone mad.
"Go and find a big stone. okay, sir!"
Why are you all staring at me?
Go and search for a big stone! come on!
Hey!
Who are you?
"Aren""t you ashamed to steal! shoes thief! come on!"
Hey! shoes thief!
What is going on?
Beware if you touched our shoes!
I am sorry.
"I need stone, not shoes."
I need stone!
Why?
Whose skull do you want to break?
"I am not mad that I will break somebody""s skull!"
No need to give justifications!
I have heard about many thieves!
But today I am seeing a fashionable thief!
That too shoes thief!
"Ma""am, talk respectfully!"
"Maybe you don""t know who I am!"
You talk politely!
"lf you talked too much, I will hand you over to the police!"
What do guys nowadays think of themselves?
This is their business!
First BA.
"And when they don""t find a job, they start stealing shoes!"
Nab him!
Hand him over to the police!
Police!
Police!
Connor:
We need to find an elevator to get back to the surface.
Matt:
"Yeah, if James knows where they are..."
James:
"Look, if we follow the tunnels we'll get out."
Kate:
But... what about the people down there?
They could still be alive couldn't they?
Connor:
"Even if they are, there's nothing we can do for them."
Connor:
The best we can do is get out and try and get help.
Kate:
But if the radiation did that to them... then...
James:
No - we're safe now the machine's off.
James:
It's just the ring itself that's radioactive.
We're safe here.
Amy:
"Oh my god, all those people..."
Amy:
How could this happen?
James:
It couldn't have happened.
You can't turn the machine on when there are people down there.
James:
There are interlock systems everywhere.
Matt:
"Well somebody fucked up, and it wasn't me!"
Connor:
No... not you.
"Okay, I'll hang up now."
This IG seems very loyal to the Law.
It seems we must think of the other scheme.
I've thought of one.
What's that?
You'll disguise goons... ...and I'll become a police officer.
Then?
And we'll kidnap Shreekant's darling daughter Radha.
It seems someone is coming.
Have the goons gone?
Take me out from here.
Please...
Just a minute.
"Sheela, someone is passing."
- Don't make noise.
Move away!
- Stop!
I said move!
- What are you doing?
Leave!
Leave me!
- What are you doing?
I will not spare him!
"- Stop, sir."
"If you'll start firing, there'll be bloodshed here."
Damodar!
Damodar!
"See, what's does."
What's written in this letter?
"Mr. Shreekan, your daughter Radha will remain... ...in my custody, until Pasha is in law's custody."
Remember!
"Aigoo, you even fold clothes so well."
"Hey, when I did all this housework, it got so tiring, but now that I have you to talk to."
It's so fun!
Its really true that a person can't live all by themselves
"Yes, it's true."
"Oh, Ha Ni!"
Can you get the laundry from Seung Jo's room?
Tomorrow is Eun Jo's day to take his P.E. outfit.
It seems I have forgotten!
"Sure, I'll be right back"
"You know that closet towards the inside, right?"
I know
OH!
It's the couples T-shirt!
He still has it.
Room for rent
Part time job?
What are you doing in someone else's room?
You came?
She told me to bring Eun Jo's gym clothes.
Then you should have just gotten it and left.
What are you looking through?
"Truthfully, I heard something from Kyung Soo Sunbae."
He said that you might even move out of this house.
"Cham... anyways, he's a little weird, right?"
It's true.
Huh?
I'm going to leave this house.
Why?
What do you mean why?
Do I need to get your permission for that too?
That's not it....
No!
Are you alright?
That fellow has taken a hostage!
We have to get him.
Go!
Seize him!
So you mean... my Eun Hye... ...disappeared while looking for the dead Hong Gil Dong?
She ran out to help Hong Gil Dong.
But she disappeared.
What will we do if she gets hurt while she's with him?
What if she gets caught with him?
I will find her myself. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Your Excellency!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Miss Eun Hye has been taken hostage by thugs!
What?
They're dangerous!
Please send for more men!
They must not be caught!
Eun Hye...!
It's alright now.
Just stay here and then go home.
Let's see.
I must have stepped on a broken piece of pottery.
You got cut.
How did you run in this state?
Because I had to run fast to get you out of danger.
"Young Master, are you alright now?"
Yes.
Why were you so agitated just now?
And what was that about not losing me?
- That was...
- Were you troubled because I was angry at you?
Yes.

"I don""t accept this wedding!"
"This is not a wedding! lts betrayal! lt""s cheating!"
"I didn""t expect this joke from you!"
"This is not a joke! lts true, Mrs. Dinanath!"
Actually I was going to marry her.

"And as soon as that finished,"
I ended up getting a job at a very demanding company.
So I don't really get to see my old man that much.

Perhaps I could come by your house afterwards ?
I could change clothes at your place.
Oh.
Uh... yeah.
I suppose that would be okay.
Sure.
- [ Engine Off ]
- Nice car !
- I'm glad you think so.
- You don't like it ?
"No, I like the car."
"By the way, though, about prom ?"
That was a bad idea.
I'm sorry I invited you.
- What are you talkin' about ?
- Please.
I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.
But you are just a jock.
"No, wait."
You're a jerk.
Wait !
I don't understand.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
"Heather, I wasn't makin' fun of you."
Gimme a break.
You're so full of it.
Fuck me !
There's gonna be an Eastern European chick naked in your house.
And you're not gonna do anything about that ?

You promised me flesh!
Raw nerves exposed to the world!
Every step is a new nightmare!
All I feel is pain!
You!
Why would they do this to me?
You want me to feel the pain?

So that I may show others.
Huzzah!

Your boyfriend...
Is it going well?
Did you propose to my sister?
You argued with your boyfriend?
You aren't speaking?
What a dunce.
Did you... propose to my sister?
"Don't worry, don't worry."
I'll find a better boyfriend for you.
You want to...
You want to make up with him...?
"Ah, you need some money?"
I'll give you some.
He really is thick-headed.
Sister-in-law.

"I have a worry, too."
But don't...

Why should he?
Perhaps an old hurt he always growls.
"Well, no, boy!"
Dick is my friend!
He saved my life!

That's how dick got written of for the border guard.
"So he is a real hero, that dog!"
"You bet, he is!"

"I think you got it backwards there, buddy."
The duck is the thing you love.
The rabbit is the thing you hate.
What?
"Yeah, I got to agree."
"Ducks up, rabbits down."
Definitely.
Ducks are better than rabbits.
"I, I get, ducks are, ducks are..."
Rabbits are adorable.
"Ducks are, they're, have you ever been in a fight with a duck?"
"I mean, ducks are jerks."
(offscreen voice) This led to one of the most intense arguments our group has ever had.
Duck is delicious.
Rabbit is all gamey.
"We're not talking about flavor, Ted."
Flavor counts.
Who carries around a duck's foot for good luck?
Anyone?
You wrap yourself in comforter stuffed with rabbit hair.
I'll wrap myself in one stuffed with duck feathers.
Who's cozier?
Oh...
No no no no no no.
But who's cozier?
Hold on.
I have to get another book.
I concede!
You win.
"Honestly, I didn't care."
"This is exactly why I didn't want you in the loop, Elena."
"Yeah, because now you can't do whatever you want."
- Damn it!
- Hey!
Everything all right out here?
Hey.
"Jamie, go back inside, ok?"
Please.
Trust me.
It's better off for you there.
I don't think so.
I'd listen to her.
"Get back upstairs, man."
I said I don't think so.
"Get back upstairs before I tear your damn throat out, do you understand me?"
I don't think you realize how bad you've gotten!
"This is the way it has to be, Elena."
"Oh, yeah, right."
Out-villain the villain.
I get it.
You're not supposed to be here.
"Jamie, what are you doing?"
What I was told.
He's not supposed to be here.
"Elena, he's compelled."
What was that?!
What are you doing here?
"Ah, looking for a bunny."
You're good.
For now.
You still obsessed with Meredith?
A great sage from Dwarka set out for a journey on foot.. ..and that afternoon the sun was really scorching.. ..l gave him a jug of water to drink.
He was so pleased.
And gave me this idol.
And this idol turned my luck around.
"I bought this, once a rented shop.. ..and a three room house in Bhooleshwar."
With terrace.
With terrace.
Amazing!
"Mr. Kanji, sell this idol to me."
I am in big trouble.
I'll rot in hell if I even think of selling my Lord.
Sell the God?
Look at what he's saying.
Mischievous...
Lord.
Listen carefully.
- Yes.
You can hear His flute.
It's time for him to play His flute.
What are you saying?
- Try to hear with devotion.
"Listen, you can hear the echo of Mathura."
"Rajastan, Om Sai Ram."
Heard it?
Can you hear?
"- Yes, yes."
Now leave.
- Sell this idol to me.
"Please, Mr. Kanji."
I'll let this idol out of my sight.. ..only when that special person arrives.
The chosen one.
Who is that?
I finally got a chance...
I should've brought a plain white t-shirt.
Excuse me.
"Excuse me, sir."
Let's start!
I want to hurry up and make something.
My mind and body aren't working together.
I can do this in my head.
None
"I was good a long time ago, really, a long time ago."
I drew very well a long time ago
When I followed friends around tagging graffiti walls
I thought I was pretty good.
I'm not used to this so I keep messing up.
A simple line should be easy to draw. but I can't even do that.
- I'm screwed.
- I'm screwed too.
I tried and tried to fix it.
But I messed up.
Where's yours?
- What picture is this?
- It's supposed to be...
- It should have a meaning.
- This is just a pattern.
The color wore off today.
So I tried another color...
None
I have a dream.
Never give up.
"Neat, huh?"
I'm finished.

- Huh?
Aren't you going to let me out?
What's wrong?
Does your stomach hurt?
No...
I'm okay.
Should I drive?
You don't even have a license.
You know what I mean.
"It's frustrating, unnerving,"
"- scary, sad, and futile."
-What is?
Poverty.
You know how long it's been?
Three years.
"But in those three years, nothing has changed."
I worked here part-time back then and I work here part-time now.
You've changed... you've grown much prettier.
You had no job then and you don't have one now.
"What drives me crazy is, in the future I'll be still here, and you'll be still unemployed."
Do you need a bag?
It costs 50 won.
- The total is 24 dollars and 80 cents.
"-Wait a bit more, give me a chance."
- I know I can do better.
- I've been waiting three years.
Hurry up and pay.
Will this work?
I think so...
We will see him together.
Okay have your seats.
He will be here soon.
Thank you.
"I see you put on a ring, Sami Bey."
"Yes, we did."
- Hayırlı olsun.
"- Amin, to all of us."
It's not much until 13 February.
"Yes, we're almost there."
- Excited?
- I'm too old to get excited like that.
Why do you say that?
You are still young.
You will have many great years together with Sami Amca.
"But still, you shouldn't listen to Cemre's marriage advices."
- Why?
"- I am getting divorced, that's why she's saying that."
"But Zeynepciğim, not even you can break my spirit today."
- I am so sorry.
- Don't be sorry.
"I mean, I am getting rid of my hunchback."
I filed my petition.
Soon it will be over.
- I wish you the best.
"- By the way, no one had forced Cemre to marry..."
I made a big mistake.
Everything is for the humans.
Hello Can Bey.
"Yes, yes, we had sent them to the factory."
"Okay, I'll be there in half an hour."
See you.
Shame on you!
Hello!
I wanted to surprise you.
I went through here and I had to stop by.
- How is your new job and....
- Serdar...
Live me alone.
What?
Look around you.
Everybody is looking at us... me...
Do you know what is being widow here?
"Narin, what are you talking about?"
"I, with my family and child, will have a new life."
Stay away from me.
Don't come anymore.
"When you see me somewhere, go to other side."
"Forget me,"
"So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle?"
Minus or plus?
There it is this little pink plus sign is so unholy.
That ain't no Etch-a-Sketch.
"This is one doodle that can't be undid, homeskillet."
Just tell them.
I'm pregnant.
Who's the father?
It's Paulie Bleeker.
Paulie Bleeker?
I didn't know he had it in him!
"I know, right?"
Did you see that coming?
Yeah.
But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
"I saw the window was open, I thought that maybe..."
Jesus!
I have a request.
I have something to ask you.
A request.
A request?
Just don't ask me to take this off.
I want to paint you.
Your face.
"Don't smile at me, My knees will go weak."
"Oh, wait!"
"I can't explain why I'm doing this, but you are difficult, too."
Just once... don't be so difficult!
Say something.
Say I'm not a thug.
I'll say something.
Those guys there are thugs.
"Hey, I asked you to say something!"
Wait!
"May10, 1995."
He's never a romantic but today after some romantic time suddenly he threw his body on me.
That bastard...
Beast!
Dad?
An unwished-for thing has happened.
That day I got pregnant.
"I got so scared, I ran to him."
"Abort it, he says."
That scoundrel...
Bastard!
I'll raise it.
"Healthy, smart, good-natured."
I don't want to hear anything.
You will have to promise that you will not tell Suraj anything.
Why are you silent?
Promise me that you will not tell Suraj anything.
"All right, Vandana."
I'll do as you say.
I've got it!
This!
What did you get?
Did you find some treasure?
He is screaming as though he has found a treasure.
You'll dance forjoy when you hear the news.
My name and my picture will be in the papers tomorrow.
At least tell us about it.
What is the matter?
"Aunty, read this out to them."
Yes.
With your blessings.
Let me also see it.
- Wait!
"Oh, all right!"
Let her also read it.
"Congratulations, Suraj!"
I am delighted.
My friends have thrown a party and I'd like to take Renu along.
"Yes, of course. ..."
"Go and get ready, my child."
"Go and get ready, my child!"
Which is your favourite colour?
- What!
I mean.
Which colour sari should I wear?
Okay.
"All right, all right !"
"- Good hustle, guys."
- Good hustle.
But you can still lose.
You all saw what happened to Oz out there.
I don't want to ever see any of you thinking you're gonna score.
You don't score until you score.
- Until you score.
"- That's right, baby !"

It all boils down to today.
"For you seniors, this marks the culmination..."
- of the past four years.
- Culmination.
[ Coach ]
I want you to think about what this means to you.
Do you guys wanna look back on your days at East... and know that you used the time you had ?
"- Hell, yeah !"
- You do !
- Ah !
"Good attitude, Ostreicher."
"- Good luck, fellas."
"Christ, I didn't tell ya to leave the game."
"I'm sorry, Coach."
"You got someplace more important to be, Ostreicher ?"
Yeah.
Ostreicher !
Oz ?
Fuckface ?
[ Coach ]
Ostreicher !
He calls himself God.
I can see him.
He can see you.
"My name's Krishna, your new neighbour."
Neighbour?
Neighbour?
The person Kanji had mortgaged his house to.. ..has sold it to me.
Here are the documents.
"And, Kanji bhai, sorry for that joke about God."
What's this?
How can he sell my house to him?
I was about to pay him on time.
I already paid him.
This isn't done.
This is my house.
Nobody can just buy it.
Relax.
Chill.
"When you get your compensation from God.. ..you can repay me, I will leave."
"And anyway, I always leave after my project is over."
Why buy the house when you want to leave?
Are you a agent?
I am not that low.
I've a consultancy firm.
I give advice to people.
- Advice.
Anyone who thinks of me.
Public service.
Service open to all.
A solution to every problem.
Sometimes it gets slightly delayed.
But...l always get there on time.
You understand?
Yes...
Let's end this.
That'll be better for both of us.
"Come on, pull yourself together."
Bravo...
Bravo...
You've convinced even me.
- Can you please leave me alone?
- Look...
For years... ...
I worked my ass off to establish this empire.
"I'll strangle you, if I lose it because of you."
I will kill you!
"- Reşat, get out!"
- Shut up!
What are we gonna do now?
Tell me what's gonna happen now?
Soon they'll find Kerim too.
- What are we gonna do when they make Kerim talk?
- Kerim won't say anything.
- He wants to leave the country.
- Come on...
- He was threatening you to confess everything.
- Not anymore.
- We talked with him last night.
He's going abroad.
- So you saw him?
"- You didn't listen to me, is that it?"
- He had called Erdoğan...
God damn Erdoğan!
What did I tell you?
And from that blood I'll write a name... ...outside Shreekant's bungalow.
Radha!
"That's great, mister!"
You lost before fighting a battle?
"No, sir."
I've not defeated.
Ever since my parents have died... ...I've been fighting life since then.
Sometimes with the name Jaikishan and sometimes as Jackie.
"My names kept changing, people kept changing."
But my destiny did not.
"But Mr. Bharat, the life of Jackie... ...is much better than Jaikishan."
Jackie is a goon.
Shreekant called me a goon.
- Mr. Jackie!
He called me a goon!
- Mr. Jackie!
Mr. Jackie!
"- Yes, I'm a goon, Shreekant."
I'm a goon.
"Fine, I don't want your daughter."
What do you think?
Will I come and beg at you?
Mr. Jackie!
- So what if I'm poor and orphan... ...I've lived on my own.
I'm very strong.
- Mr. Jackie.
I'm very strong!
"Jackie, the don!"
"Jackie, the don!"
"Jackie, the don!"
"Jackie, the don!"
Never mind if Radha's wedding cards are distributed... ...but I don't like Jimmy's character.
"Well, here."
What is this?
The monthly rent you paid us while you were living in our home.
This person couldn't bring herself to use it.
Why are you giving this back to me?
You shouldn't do this.
You helped us so much during that time.
I can't accept this.
Here.
"Ki Dong shi, are you really going to be like that?"
"If you don't accept it, I'm going to be mad."
Yes.
Just as your restaurant was getting really popular..
I know that you were going to build a second floor.
"And because of the new house, and Ha Ni..."
I also know that you couldn't do anything.
"But, still... this."
"Ki Dong shi, don't be like that and... just come live with us again?"
Yes?
I came out because of Ha Ni.
This is better for Ha Ni.
Pardon?
For Ha Ni?
How can you not know your daughter's heart?
"Actually, Ha Ni and Seung Jo... you don't know that they're trying to hide something from us do you?"
Pardon?
Hide something?
Those two have even kissed!
And Seung Jo did it first.
Kiss?
Seung Jo did?
Yes.
"Hey, look, I know it's hard."
But Jenna's gone.
And you're allowed to move on.
"Oh, you're still alive?"
I assume that means
Klaus didn't get his coffins.
"Well, don't look so happy."
I was only able to get one of them out in time.
The locked one.
Probably a good choice.
Yeah.
"You know, if you're banking on Bonnie's mama to open it, you're screwed."
She doesn't have any powers.
Ah.
Doesn't surprise me.
It's been that kind of night.
Is Elena ok?
I take it you two had a heart to heart.
And I take it you don't want to talk about it.
Noted.
So why don't we talk about this?
What did you do?
You have your family back.
Finally.
You're going to open them?
Not quite yet.
I still have some unfinished business to take care of.
What business?
"So, Niklaus..."
Elijah?
What did I miss?
Sync and corrected by Rafael UPD www.addic7ed.com/
Go with Serdar Bey.
"Good evenin, Zilan"
Ohhh. welcome...
"You are coming with full hands, again, I see..."
What can I say?
I am a middle man.
Serdar Bey buys and we carry the stuff.
How are you doing?
Are you okay?
Do you get weary?
"May God thank you, Inci abla, and Serdar Bey."
"If I said my prayers have been accepted, it would be true."
Are all your dreams this?
"A comfortable job, place?"
Enough money.. anything else?
Ali Asker... a person never stops dreaming of more...
"But, we don't have the strength (right) to ask for more than this."
"Nothing is certain, Zilan..."
"You are okay, right?"
Not bad...
"You are saying you are not good, then?"
"You are saying, 'don't even ask.."""
Good night.
Good night.
Didn't I say that you were not go there?
"That if you wanted to see your mother, to go during the day?!"
"And, Serdar is the one to drop you off!"
Why is this doctor still in our life???
Why do you bring this man to our door?
"I didn't want to, I said I could come by myself."
My mother said..
Why don't you listen to me?
Please help us!
Help us!
I don't want to die!
Stop!
"Young Master, why are you here again?"
"It will make things difficult for us, if it's said that such a thing happened on our ship."
Stop this immediately.
I had no intention of throwing them in either.
I just wanted to see someone's reaction.
What a waste.
You missed an interesting spectacle.
That's alright.
Now it's Yongmun?
What if he recognizes Gil Dong?
This is getting complicated.
Still there's not too many of them to fight.
Go Add.
Don't you feel anything?
You've been quiet.
Scared?
"Come on, Add."
Mom.
I miss you.
I want to see you at the cemetery next time.
"Hey, why did you stop?"
Did you see a ghost?
"No, I'll take Dow to her mom's cemetery."
Huh?
You're going to a cemetery?
We've just escaped from one.
And we're going to a ghost city.
Are you crazy?
Hasan! come to your senses!
"What are you doing? shekhar! shekhar! okay, boss! over!"
"Listen! lnform everybody to stop today""s work! okay!"
I can even lay down my life for my country! keep your life and country with you!
Just do your work!
Mad fellow!
Leave!
"No work today! stop today""s work!"
"lts Tiger singh""s order!"
"Tiger singh""s order?"
Tiger singh has gone mad!
"You are right, sir!"
He commands us because he has money!
I will tackle him!
What will we answer those from whom we have taken gold?
"lf this continues, then we will have to shut down our business!"
And what about my money?
Yes! - shut up!
John!
"- Yes, kaka sir!"
"Tell Jagga to stop only gold fish""s supply today."
"Remember, Pinto!"
Boat number 40 will surely depart! kaka sir! kaka sir!
DDT has taken the gold fish!
Thank you!
Thank you!
ldiot!
What is this?
Will I open a fish shop here?
I had told you to bring gold and not fish!
"Papa, you can""t eat gold!"
You can eat fish!
We searched the car and found this photograph.
I have to fill in a report now.
Come with me later to report your brother's disappearance.
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?
There's blood there.
Where?
"The car's beat up, but blood?"
Okay.
I'll take it away.
- You'll take it the way it is?
- Thanks.
Well...
Pablo!
This is the Rio Grande Police Department.
Your call will be attended to in a few moments.
Please hold the line.
Rio Grande...
Pablo!
God!
My God!
God?.
"You communists spend half your lives trying to prove God doesn't exist and when things go wrong, you call his name."
But he won't hear you because you're on the wrong side.
"Dad, please don't hurt me."
I'm your daughter.
What's that?
You're my daughter?
My daughter Malena is 6 years old and she's at home with my wife.
You are not my daughter.
You're just a subversive piece of shit.
We're here to educate you people.
The rich.
The landowners.
Now they'll be yours.
"Cows, bulls, hens, pigs - all yours."
Give me back my cow!
"You'll have to wait, my dear."
We'll give you everything in time.
You're a free woman.
A citizeness!
Here's where they buried him.
"Next morning the grave was open, the coffin empty."
Since then everyone passing by the graveyard gets in trouble.
- But people do drive past.
- But it's not him...
Didn't Pyotr go at night?
Hear that?
Hear that?
Father!
Look!
THE AVENGERS
Good Lord!
Is it true?
- Honest to God.
- He's talking through his hat.
"I didn't believe it myself at first, then looked around... and saw a coffin flying over the graves."
And beside the road - ghosts with scythes.
And not a sound... not a sound.
Stop!
Stop!
You do better today.
"But when you kick him in the belly, swing your leg harder."
- Got it?
"Yes, sir!"
"What""s your age?"
"- 32, sir!"
32?
"- Yes, sir!"
What was your age when you joined the police force?
"32, sir!"
32?
"- Yes, sir!"
How long have you been in police service?
"- 32, sir! strange!"
How did you get stuck at 32?
"Yes, sir!"
"Yes, sir!"
You must have read about Bheesma Pitama in Ramayana!
"Not in Ramayana, I had read about him in Mahabharat."
"But you read it in lndia itself. sir, his age was 275 years."
"And the secret of his long life was that.. ..he was a bachelor like me. sir, you should count a person""s real age after his marriage."
You are right!
You are an interesting man!
"Yes, sir! sir, shall I come with you?"
"No! lf you want, you can go and.."
"Yes, sir!"
Now it is too late!
Did you patch up with your beloved?
That is not a problem.
"But her unlucky papa, he interferes a lot, boss!"
"Boss, give me such an idea.. such an idea.."
That he stops interfering!
"Yes, boss!"
He should be completely defeated!
What does her father wants?
And be quick.
"Ok, boss."
Here the connection is removed.
Let us put it in the girls room.
"Hey Anjanna, put this lantern in the girls room."
"Hey, he is escaping with the girl."
Catch him.
Is everyone safe?
Let us go from here.
We are waiting for a long time now.
We didnt see any train.
I am scared.
Is there any train now?
Why are you scared?
Not for myself.
I am feared about Shailu.
I asked in the enquiry.
"There is only one train, that too goods."
It will not stop in this station.
Still Venkat and Jagan has not came.
How can we leave them?
Venkat told us to leave with Shailu whether he comes or not.
I dont come until Venkat is here.
Here they come.
Venkat!
Is everything all right?
Do you know how scared I am?
When will the train arrive?
There is only one goods now.
Let us somehow try to catch it.
You are not coming with us.
What are you saying?
What sight of love did you cast on me!
You made my plight bad.
Even beautiful face is a vice.
My heart is yours.
I promise you.
My heart is yours.
I promise you.
I understand your intentions.
I have already studied the book of heart.
What sight of love did you cast on me!
You made my plight bad.
Even beautiful face is a vice.
People only cast evil sight.
What sight of love did you cast on me!
Greetings.
- Greetings.
Good!
- Good!
Good!

"Don""t forget that!"
My sweet love!
Hasan!
"Don""t deceive sir!"
Why are you inviting trouble?
"lf Tiger singh found out, he will not spare you!"
Get lost!
Hey!
"Don""t aggravate the matter!"
- You must be bored here.
- I'm not bored.
Sashka Belykh gave me a book of magic tricks.
I've been practising.
"Wanna see the""Flying Queen?"""
- Sure!
- That's where you are!
Snitches!
"- Who, we?"
- And your stupid flowers!
- Can't trust you with a secret!
- Who told Dynin?
- You are the snitches!
- We?
- Who else?
Who took the mirror and Shagalova to Dynin?
- They're not out there just killing for fame.
- They just wanna be famous.
- They should be in every major city.
- Every major city.
These guys are playing God.
"I mean, this whole religious twist?"
Who the hell do they think they are?
"Hell yeah, I believe in capital punishment!"
If they let me I'll pull the switch.
Get 'em all!
Kill 'em all!
"I'm all for it... because the more people they kill, the better it is for everybody"
"No, ...you don't even know!"
- Sign me up man.
- Sign me up.
- Where can I sign up?
It's our nation.
"You crack jokes about me, maybe not in public but I'm sure you do when you go home."
[Laughter]
Okay so thank you.
"Do you mind if we don't ask your question Derrick, because we've gone over time."
"So maybe can we.. sorry, no announcements, so the announcement is - there is no announcements tonight!"
[Laughter].
"So if you've got any other questions or you'd like to discuss that matter with me afterwards sir, please come up after the talk is finished."
Look I can be a shark.
Now my whole house is great.
I can do anything good.
I like my school.
I like anything.
I like my dad.
I like my cousins.
I like my aunts.
I like my Allisons.
I like my mom.
I like my sister.

I like my dad.
I like my hair.

I like my whole house! ♪ My whole house is great.
I can do anything good.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
I can do anything good.
"Better than anyone, better than anyone. ♪"
No.
"Look, I'm telling you the truth."
"You've gotta trust me, Pete."
"Mate, you've put me right fucking in it."
If I don't convince those boys... ...that the head of their firm was not just taken by a fucking Yank journo... ...the GSE is done.
So I'm gonna go out there... ...and I'm gonna tell them that Bov's got it wrong... ...and that you're one of us.
And I had better be fucking right.
"So, Bovver... ...is there anything else you wanna tell us?"
"Listen, Tom, please."
This is how it's gotta go down.
"You're the only one going down, little Bovver."
Grass.
Fuck.
This shit with Bovver could tear this firm apart.
"Mate, I need you."
"Stay with us, just through Millwall."
I'm not gonna help you.
"I made a promise to my wife and kids, all right?"
And I'm sticking to it.
"You know, there comes a time... ...when the best reputation you can have is the one where your family--"
- What is it?
- Get down.
Get the fuck down.
"Hello, boys."
Jesus.
Pete.
"Pete, come on, man!"
"Hello, Terry."
Fuck off!
Terry.
Terry.
Look who's back in the fucking Abbey after all these years.
Just get it out.
"If you keep squirming, maybe I'll feel sorry for you."
You've changed.
Something's different about you.
You're stronger.
Tougher.
"You're not the only one who changed, Stefan."
We all had to.
That's good to know.
There's something I have to tell you.
And it's not because I feel guilty that it happened.
It's because I feel guilty that you don't know.
I kissed Damon.
There.
All done.
What happened to him?
He was found in the woods.
An actual animal attack.
Bite marks and gashes over half his body.
Lost about 3 liters of blood.
"Well, is he going to make it?"
Nope.
At least not on his own.
What is that?
Exactly what you think it is.
Vampire blood.
You wanted to know my secret?
I cheat.
I'm a doctor and I hate when people die.
"So when I have the ability to do something about it,"
I do.
Stefan...
"That was because I felt like you were doing the wrong thing, not because I hated you."
"We're friends, that's why I..."
I took care of Choi Chul Joo.
The girls have all been returned to their parents.
And Choi Chul Joo... paid for his crimes.
Did you do it?
That's great!
"Well done, Young Master!"
I always knew you were a good person!
You're smiling!
Look at that!
"If you do good, you'll smile automatically!"
Look at how nice you look when you smile!
That's enough.
Fine.
You're so stiff.
Why did you hug me like that just now?
"Young Master, do you...?"
Did any suspicious men come for you?
How did you know that?
- Then what happened?
- Suspicious men did come for me.
Who are you?
Are you Heo Yi Nok?
"That's right. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Yi Nok, what are you doing?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Send him away!
I...
I'm so full that I've laid down.
How did they...?
"My granddaughter has never been full in her life, you fools!"
That's fortunate.
I'm really lucky.
It doesn't have to fall on you.
The coffin is spelled shut.
That makes it a witch problem.
So it does fall on me.
I was bound to see my mother again sooner or later.
Sooner.
"Abby Bennett Wilson, Monroe, North Carolina."
"Born in Mystic Falls hospital, graduated Mystic Falls High, blah, blah, blah."
A little compulsion helps to speed up the research process.
This is her.
"Yep, road trip."
I call shotgun.
"Yeah, no."
Why?
You want me to hang out in the back with you?
"You're not coming, Damon."
Why?
I'm the one who found her.
"Ok, Damon, look,"
Bonnie hasn't seen her mom in over 15 years.
We don't need your snarky commentary narrating the experience.
What's going on with you two?
We kissed.
Now it's weird.
Have a great trip.
What are you doing here?
I came to apologize.
Apologize?
You bit me.
I could have died.
"I think we're way past apologies, Tyler."
That's the problem.
Look there.
Gods are bare-bodied.
Like this.
They're never fully covered.
"That's your wedding photo, right?"
- Yes.
Wearing that traditional attire.
"So, did you only wear a traditional attire.. ..since your wedding?"
"No, right?"
- No.
See.
That's our older image.
"Conch in one hand, mace in the other."
Where are yours?
"lf I keep holding them all day, won't my arms hurt?"
Think.
"Actually, our latest photos haven't been updated on Facebook."
"People still use the older ones, and we let them."
We don't have a problem.
- Let them.
- That's enough.
You're boring me now.
"Get out, leave."
Mahadev!
- Mahadev!
- Only you can hear and see me.
"Yes, coming."
Coming.
Mahadev!
What happened?
"What happened, Kanji?"
See him.
Feels loyal to Klaus because Klaus' blood created him.
He released me from a curse that was ruining my life.
I owe him for that.
I need you to bite your girlfriend.
A hybrid bite would kill a vampire.
Consider this me putting your undying loyalty to the test.
Klaus can't control me.
Not when it comes to you.
Ahhh.
Oh!
"Oh, no."
Did you just...Bite me?!
Caroline!
Get away from me!
I figured out how to open it.
Can you?
Let me out!
Please!
"Oh, my God, oh, my God."
Hey!
I'm in here!
I'm in here!
I'm in here!
I've been having these dreams for days now.
It's like the witches are trying to send me a message.
I just can't believe you guys have kept this from me this whole time.
"Stefan thought if you knew where the coffins were,"
Klaus could threaten people to get the information out of you.
So these are the rest of his family?
"Yeah, Elijah and two others."
Now this one...
Is the one we can't open.
"Jackie is injured, sir."
He can't go much far.
He must be somewhere nearby.
D'souza!
Wherever he's...
I can't return home until I find him.
You... sir?!
"- Yes, I..."
Now I'll bring Jackie dead.

Say I can't stand being with a guy like him anymore.
But... you want me to say that?
Just help me this once.
I can't say it to him myself.
Mi-ryung asked me to tell you this.
She wants to break up with you.
She can't stand... being with a guy like you any longer.
He's crying.
You can hang up now.
She said you're a really good person.
She hopes you can find someone better.
"Yes, really."
Wait.
Now what?
You said it's finished!
Thank you so much.
-Your nose is bleeding.
-What?
Don't bother.
We're over
Separation Agency
"For people who are hesitant about breaking up, or for those who have trouble saying the words,"
"I will... no, we will do it for you."
Separation Agency.
I wish it would just pour rain and cool things off.
Excuse me?
Is anybody here?
Didn't she come in here just now?
Oh my god!
You nearly gave me a heart attack.
"Damn, why's it so dark?"
Is it on backwards again
I am at home.
Welcome.
Thank you.
"Mustafa, this girl is very beautiful, too."
But...
There is pain in her eyes.
Have you burned this girl?
She burned you?
"No, I don't believe that..."
"These eyes have learned to get burned,  they don't know how to burn."
"These looks are not the ones that burn,  they are the ones that get burned."
Narin?!
I'm here...
"Narin, where are you?"
"This is my fate, Yasar..."
To look at Mustafa from a distance.
"I won't be able to be beside him until I die, but..."
I will always look at my husband from a distance...
Like this...
I will always look at my husband.
You haven't been eating...
They said so...
You should eat...
Think of your child...
Narin...
Where have you been?
"Where have you been, Narin?"
"I have been in the hell that you put me, Mustafa... (Singing in Kurdish)"
You are a rose
A spring rose
You are the light of my soul
You are a rose
Do you know what lemons called in Warangal?
What are they called?
- They are called Lemons.
That is what is called extra speech.
Pour 2 litres.

"My boy, where is the club for playing cards?"
Search!
There is nothing you cannot find by searching.
I did not like your face.
Did I like yours?
Am I not adjusting?
How much did it cost?
- Sixty-eight.
How much?
- Sixty-Eight.
Is it sixty-eight?
I have sixty.
Keep the change.
Ah!
He gave 8 rupees less and asking me to keep the change?!
Ah!
What a son in law!
He is making my daughters shift from place to place.
"He plays cards, has debts every where and has got us a bad name."
Grandmother!
We all know about father.
Leave the matter.
All these days she supported him.
Now you are doing that?
He left us at home with out any care and.. .. now we dont know in which club or .. ..under which tree he is playing cards.
I am here!
I'll scold him!
"Dalyan, I'm sure one of your men will have a knife."
I want it now.
What will you do?!
I want it now.
Don't waste time.
I can be thrown in solitary confinement anytime now!!
Dalyan...
Stab me!
My soul is burning when firing the trigger...
That look of yours... saying 'Don't forget me!'...
It marked my betrayal on my forehead.

Shoot!
"C'mon, shoot!...Shoot..."
Shoot!
"Shoot, but know this Nejdet..."
"I would never betray you, lan."

I'm telling you I'm not betraying you!
I will never do it!
There's delay but not denial.
"Just like I came here, to help Kanji bhai."
Help me?
I found out about your condition.. ..only after I brought the house.
"The court case, lost your shop.. ..and your wife and children too."
"Kanji bhai, don't worry."
You can stay here.
"ln return, I will only use your things."
"Television, fridge, etcetera."
"Fine, but remember.. ..one day I will buy this house back from you."
So be it!
"I mean, I promise."
He's a nice man.
- Something you said.
"No, just.."
Cheers.
Calls himself God.
I think he's drunk.
"Thank you, for letting me stay in my own house."
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
I will sleep outside on the terrace.
And you can sleep wherever you want.
It's your house.
Thank you.
Goodnight.
"And yes, the light switch is at the back."
Switch off the lights before you go to sleep.
Another power failure.
No. you switched it off.
"- No, I didn't."
You're drunk.
- She wasn't that bad.
- What?
Telling the only cool boy in Eastbourne I have flatulence issues is okay?
I don't think he took any notice.
"And, anyway, he was well into you before your mum came in."
- Do you think so?
- Yeah.
You were great asking him about his band and stuff.
"- And he likes cats, like me."
- Yep.
Did you see the way Tom held onto my hand a little too much
- when he gave me the onions?
- He didn't!
He is so gorgeous!
They're both beyond the Valley of the Gorgeous.
"Oh, are you sure my mum hasn't ruined it?"
"Oh, GG, it was really fab."
- Fabbity fab?
- With knobs on.
And Robbie will understand.
All parents say stupid things.
He'll probably like you more 'cause he'll feel bad you've got a mum that's beyond bonkerdom.
You're right.
"God, Robbie's just so muscley and dreamy and..."
"- Tom said, ""See you later."""
- I know.
So did Robbie.
- What exactly does that mean?
- I'm not sure.
Do you think Tom says that to everyone
"like a sort of ""See you later"" sort of thing?"
No.
Wait!
"Hey, hey, hey!"
"Aw, Mike!"
"Michael, we love you."
"Okay, everybody."
That's a wrap.
- Good day.
- Where are we from?
From Galanta.
"My name is Katka Szabová, I'm from Galanta,"
I'm 26 years old.
Are you nervous?
- Of course.
- Can we help you anyhow?
"- Sorry, but you will sing?"
- Me.
"(Ja - German word for ""yes"")"
- Ich verstehe.
"- Also gut dann, na ja."
Do you think you can sing?
"Of course, I also think I can sing."
"All right, we will finish this discussion after the performance."
We should not dig into it any further.
Here you go!
"No art, no skill, just a feeling, but for me it belongs to those who perform or entertain, they can't do much, only create an atmosphere, but here she took too much."
She did not.
- That's the kind of people.
- She did.
"Katka, I want to say, that Paľo pushed this."
I just want the good for you.
Let me ask: would anybody of you pay for this?
We're not here in some singing school.
- How much?
10 rupees.
Bring this bag also.
- I am already carrying two bags.
Why dont you give it to brother-in-law?
He is already carrying the burden of the family.
You bring it.
- I will bring it.
"Have you understood, uncle?"
They say I am not securing marks and you dont have job.
"Sister, where are you going?"
Those brinjals are fresh.
You wait here.
- Is it necessary?
What happened to these people?
Uncle!
- What is it?
Do you like that girl?
"I have told you about a girl, Do you remember?"
She is the girl.
Who?
That train beauty?
Yes.
Will you do a favor to me please?
Take your parents out from here.
"Ok, I will do that."
Will you buy me a chocolate?
I will give you as many as you want.
Mom!
- What happened?
"Mom, the chips which you kept out for drying.. ..will be spoiled in this rain."
"Sister, Why are you still standing here?"
Ah.
"I mean, don't you have an original vampire to worry about?"
"Ah, ah, ah, do ten more of those."
You're going to want to buff up if you start dating this one.
Self defense and all.
What is your problem?
Your doctor vervained me.
And then she bloodjacked me.
What?
"I mean, when did you even see her?"
When I went to the hospital to accuse her of killing her ex-boyfriend.
"Which, by the way, very sensitive subject."
"Damon, what the hell are you doing, huh?"
Why are you mad at me?
I told you I'd handle this!
I proved your theory...
Diagnosed psycho case.
You're welcome.
Why are you doing this?
Stop moving.
"Jamie, let me go."
"Jamie, he needs help."
- Jamie!
- Bonnie!
Bonnie!
What the...
These chains aren't strong enough.
You need to leave.
Run!
So?
She didn't tell me where the coffins are.
The vampire showed up.
"Hey, I'm busy."
Go and let the students practice.
"Oh Ha Ni, teach him well."
Yes.
"Now, Sunbae, you be the girl."
"Okay, girl."
The head is lifted like this.
"""What are you doing to me?"""
"""Try to forget me if you can"""
"You won't be able to forget it, right?"
I won't be able to forget it.
"Wow, this is really great!"
"Yes, I understand the timing now."
But for the kiss... when I watch movies
Do I turn to the left or right.
Or like spiderman...
Do I do it upside down?
The angle?
"No, I think kissing is about timing."
"Ah, kissing is timing."
Timing...
"Ha Ni, you are very good at kissing."
No.
"Truthfully, I don't really know about it."
What are you talking about?
"If you're at this level, you'll be able to publish a book."
Isn't she hard to understand?
"In the tennis club, the girl who follows Baek Seung Jo around."
You heard about that too?
Is that rumor true?
Yes.
There must be a fun rumor going around.
"I beg your pardon, but when is today?"
I don't care about today!
It's boring!
Every day - it is today.
How do we cope with that?
Can it be that one day Time will stop and we will say:
Yesterday is every morning.
Life is awfully boring.
"Life is awfully boring, Yesterday is every morning."
"Let tomorrow come today, It is where we hurry."
"Let the future come our way, - Then we wouldn't worry."
Don't you see that everything around belongs tomorrow?
Don't you feel the future has already come?
"lf the future had come, now it would have been... the New Year!"
The New Year?
The New Year?
Let it be the New Year!
"What, what New Year?"
The New Year doesn't come just like that.
You have to see it in.
Then let's!
"Let's, let's see it in!"
Let's!
"I'd say, why don't we really see it in?"
"It is so pleasant, my friends, to see in the New Year."
Very pleasant.
How?
How?
How shall we see it in?
"To see in the New Year, we need, first of all, a Christmas tree."
"Secondly, Santa Claus."
"And, last but not least, the Snow Maiden."
"- Oh, all right!"
You go first.
- Can I invite boys?
"You haven't got some fancy fellow we don't know about, have you?"
No.
"Honestly, Dad."
"No one says ""fella"" any more."
"This isn't the Middle Ages, you know."
Or the '70s as you call it.
"Sorry, Dad."
I must be hormonal.
Can I have a D. J?
Why would we pay for one when we've already got one in the family?
- What?
"- Oh, yes."
No way.
"Oh, I want music from this century, Dad."
"If we hire a club, we'll get a D.J. thrown in."
We are not going to hire a club.
I can get a very good rate at the community hall.
We've thrown some legendary bashes there.
We still know how to get down.
"Hey, wait, missy."
I haven't told you my news.
"Okay, just please stop snogging."
It's not normal.
- I have been offered a promotion.
"- Oh, cool."
Maybe I can get a PDA instead of a mobile now?
"Georgia, where in the world do you find the most geomagnetic thermal activity?"
"- I don't know, Dad."
- New Zealand.
Take it.
Separation Agency
Stop sighing at the ground!
Stop sighing at the sky.
I guess she doesn't want to see you.
Really?
Ask her to call me later.
Huh?
He understood.
She likes you a lot.
Don't worry.
"No, it's okay."
I'll eat dinner at home.
By myself.
I'll just go.
See you.
You're not the one who got burned.
Why are you hiding?
Leave me alone.
Why are you being so childish?
How long will you hide there?
I said leave me alone!
"Don't just yell for help, you need to help him first."
At least you can say &amp;amp;quot;l love you.&amp;amp;quot;
You're better off than me.
Su-Eun.
You know why I wanted him to propose to me?
It was all for him.
If he confessed his love and thought about marriage and such.
"Then, he could think about me once more before jumping into the fire and make him a bit more scared of the fire I thought I could change him."
That's how it started but now
I've become sort of fixated on it.
"I don""t know where the gold is! sardar, you don""t know."
But kaka sir surely knows.
"Am I right, kaka sir?"
"Won""t you serve your country?"
"Mr. Diwan, I can even lay down my life for my country! kaka sir.. where is shekhar?"
"- I don""t know! kaka sir, don""t fool us!"
Where is the culprit?
"I think you don""t know that the government will reward.. ..the person who helps to seize the gold by giving 10% share. kaka sir, constable is right."
We give you 10 minutes to think.
You can think.
We are waiting for you outside.
"Let""s go, Mr. Diwan!"
Listen..
Bhuta singh.. the police is right.
- Then?
This is the golden chance to serve our country.
You are so lucky.
- How?
Go with the police and get shekhar arrested.
And get myself killed! - shut up!
I will give the address.
You can serve your country.
Fine. send Ms. kitty in.
Did you call me?
"No, Ms. kitty."
Your good luck has called you.
- What?
The police are waiting for you outside.
- Police?
The police know that you are hiding here.
"Now I can""t hide you here for long."
There is only one way left for your escape.
No more bedroom!
"Hello, Mr. Rajesh!"
"- How are you, Mr. Diwan?"
I am fine.
You tell me.
What news have you brought?
The news is that today constable seized 1500 gm of gold.
Well done!
1500 gm of gold!
Dharamdas Tiwari has given the statement that.. ..his boss shekhar gave him this gold! shekhar?
Yes!
My best friend and your son-in-law!
"We are forced to doubt him, Mr. Diwan."
Mr. Rajesh.. so what if he is my son-in-law?
"Even if my child had been a culprit.. ..still I wouldn""t have been lenient."
Thanks.
This is what I expected from you.
We received the news that shekhar is returning tomorrow from.. ..flight number Boc 3796.
I have posted clDs at different places. so that we receive the information. okay.
I need one more favour from you.
- Tell me.
You go to receive shekhar at the dockyard.
And keep a close watch on his luggage. so that we can arrest the culprit along with the evidence.
"Welcome, boss. okay, boss! cheers!"
"Welcome, boss!"
- Hello.
"Welcome home, Tiger singh!"
Diamonds!
Diamonds!
- Diamonds! very good! very good!
lts worth 50 lakhs!
All real! very good! very good!

lnternational crook. crook. crook.
lnternational crook.
Bhuta singh!
- Yes!
Do you want to lose your life?
- No!
"lf you spilled out everything, then you will lose your life!"
No!
- Listen!
- Yes!
Patriotism and business are not linked with each other!
Got it? - okay!
Where is shekhar?
"He has gone to Alibagh to meet his wife. shekhar, look at your state."
Why do you wander around like this?
"Why don""t you surrender yourself to the police?"
At least you will feel at peace.
Peace?
"That""s why l have always helped.. ..the police in the name of patriotism. seema.. now what I am doing.. ..l am doing it for peace of my mind."
That day is not far away when you will take my name with pride.
Beware!
That day will never arrive! shoot him!
"lf you want to save the child""s life.. then drop the revolver."
"lf you didn""t come out till I count 5.. ..then we will kill the child!"
1 .. 2.. ..3..
No!
Give me my child!
Leave him!
Leave him!
No!
"I won""t let this happen!"
"In case she's changed her name, you can identify her with the red mole."
There's a huge grudge between us.
"Remember her."""
Are you Shu Baifeng?
Miss Mu.
"I admire your boldness, but you can't address me by my full name."
Don't you have any manners?
I can't disobey my mother.
My mother once said:
"Should I see her enemy Shu Baifeng, ...I must kill her."
Who is your mother?
Qin Hongmian.
Then it's your mess.
Leave us.
Yes.
You too.
What a resemblance!
I should have known... with your personality.
What are you talking about?
Follow me.
How do you know Yi Yang Finger?
That's my father's exclusive style.
That's the master stroke of our Tuan Family.
Hasn't your mother told you?
You stole it from my father.
Don't make up any excuse.
"Call Tuan Yu out, we must put an end to this."
Lady.
You can never marry my son.
You forgot your word.
I want to hear this from him.
He can't see you right now.
We're done.
Great work.
Great work.
"We are B.A.P, great work."
We're finished.
Now I'm going to hurry back and wash up to go to sleep.
I'm not sure if I did well.
But tomorrow will be a better day.
PEACE!
We're done.
See you tomorrow.
Bye bye.
Before we start shooting
I was going to get something cool to drink.
But I ordered some napkins.
- Where is this?
- This is the 21st century.
- There's a soup stain here.
- This is the 'it' item for 21st century.
A boy from 21st century.
Something unbelievable has happened.
Something that should not happen...
We were supposed to film here.
But there's a problem.
So we have to film the next scene first...
So we have to head to the hotel right now.
Let's go to the hotel!
None
"It's huge, there's a pool!"
How many rooms are there?
The water's too hot.
The cost of one night's stay so much.
I cannot stand it any more.
I will marry you tomorrow itself.
Why do you look like that?
I am giving you time only till the marriage hour.
You must change not only your mind ...
That will never happen.
- It will happen.
Never.
Cant you hear?
Dont you know the fate of Ravana who kidnapped Sita?
Open your eyes atleast now.
Hey Ravana!
Get ready for the war.
Change the story.
Are you Rama?
Take the nuptials from Sitas neck and give them to Ravana.
He will tie them.
Are you mad?
Why will Rama remove Sitaa nuptials.
"Hey, remove the nuptials."
"- Sir, it is a sacrilege."
It is a sin.
Did you see this?
The power went off.
This is a bad omen.
What nonsense?
Inquire what happened.
Maybe lord Rama has come.
"Hey you, come here."
Did you check everything?
Yes we checked all the fuses.
Now check the transformer.
"Wow, it is cold."
I heard it's supposed to be really hot here.
I always envisioned this place with the sun shining all the time...
- It rained today.
- Cool.
None
- Let's go over there.
- There's nothing here.
"Board shop, board shop!"
I like this.
None
None
You know Dropkick Murphys?
Dropkick Murphys!
My ideal girl looks good simply in a white top and blue jeans.
This is the perfect size.
I only bought one pair of shoes.
I'm picking out clothes now.
"I have to buy a board, a board."
All done.
Zelo is very excited right now.
Zelo!
Don't I look silly?
Can I see how I look?
My hair got short all of a sudden.
"For this album, I was going for a different look"
"With an American feel, in general."
So I cut my hair real short for a unique styling.
"lf I don't style this hair and go out,"
Then I look kind of foolish.
I've always tried to cover my ugly face with hair.
So I grew my hair out but now I can't even do that.
You cannot claim insurance in such cases.
Because these are natural calamities.
But I don't believe in God.
Tell him.
I don't care if you do or don't.
You're signatures are right here.
I am so sorry.
Sorry?
What sorry?
Sir.
"Sir, I've invested my entire earnings in the shop."
Even my house is mortgaged.
And you're saying sorry.
"I know, but your claim cannot be approved."
You may go now.
"No, sir."
I won't leave until my claim isn't approved.
Security.
Sir..
"Sir, why are you calling security?"
I'm talking to you decently.
"- Yes, sir."
"Take him away, please."
- Why call the security..
Come on.
- Just a minute.
Just a minute.
Come on.
You just know how to swindle our money.
Mind your language.
You should be publicly beaten.
Throw him out.
Even if just for me.
Imagine it wasn't him.
He tried to find out the truth but ran out of time.
"Now he wants me to do something, Malena."
"Pablo, that doesn't make sense."
Know what really doesn't make sense?
Trying to save a dead person's life.
You know what?
They had been locked up for 4 months.
And tortured.
But they managed to escape.
They picked up the girl and ran.
They tried to start a new life.
But that son-of-a-bitch... found them again.
He went after them and killed them.
"Pablo, are you okay?"
"No, I'm not okay."
What did you expect?
How could anyone do something like that?
You know what really gets me?
I don't know anything about them... about what they did before.
"I'd like to know who they were, Malena."
Time's up.
"I'll take the ferry back tomorrow and meet you, okay?"
"Pablo, be careful."
"Stay here, okay?"
Mommy.
Where's my mommy?
It's okay.
Your mommy's okay.
Stay here.
Don't move.
"Okay, I'll get the ham rolls."
But do me a favour.
Don't get up to mischief.
When have we ever got up to mischief?
"Okay, Rex."
See the sun?
"The first one there gets two ham rolls, okay?"
Thank you.
Shall I call a doctor?
No.
I'm all right.
I have to ask you to tell me what happened.
I went to his office to take him some papers.
He locked the door and pounced on me.
He put his hands down the front of my dress.
Then he tried to tear off my clothes.
I was so scared I couldn't even scream.
He must have been drinking again.
I have heard that Mr Fuchs has a drinking problem.
What happened after that?
He grabbed me and I finally managed to scream.
"When I heard Ricarda, I went into his office and saw he'd got hold of her."
I'm going to the police to report him.
Calm down.
We'll deal with this.
- Are you going to ignore it?
- Don't worry.
This will have consequences for Mr Fuchs.
I'll speak to him.
"Ms Limmer, how could you do this to me?"
"Ms Bosch, please..."
"Mr Fuchs, please."
Leave no one behind.
All of us.
Do you feel better now?
Did I seem like I wasn't good before?
Did something happen with you and Madam Noh?
You looked so fierce just now when you were talking about her!
I've never seen you like that.
You looked like a stranger!
Something became very precious to me without me realizing it.
But I thought I had lost it.
So did you lose it?
No.
"Fortunately, I didn't lose it."
That's good.
Then you should reconcile with Madam Noh.
You said she was like a mother to you.
"In my opinion, she cares very much for you."
Yes.
I should go.
You should go now.
I should keep my promise.
"Oh, your name!"
What's your name?
My name is Chang Hui.
Chang Hui?
You can't say it out loud.
You can't say it in front of anyone.
And you can't call me in public.
Can you promise me this?
Then why did you tell me?
Because I wanted you to know what it was.
If I know that you know my name... ...
My father asked me to protect the plants.
My fathers will surely kill me.
There's no need for that.
Because there's something going to happen to you.. ..after which you will die of shame.
What did you say about us on the phone?
Ghost.
Witch.
Today we'll make your plight such that.. ..you won't be able to face the entire neighbourhood.
What do you mean?
I mean..
Kundan.
We mean.. that day we pulled your father's loincloth.. ..and today its your turn.
"No, Kundan."
"Kundan, I would be left with no clothes."
It's okay.
"- Mala, please tell them."
"Kundan, be careful."
Kitchen Kumar is very delicate.
Kishen.
Give me this cloth.
No!
"Mala,"
Where are my roses?
Where are my roses?
The roses were drying.
So I made a paste out of them.
Where's the paste?
I..
I.. it was mother's anniversary.. ..so I fed the paste to mother..
"No, to the bull."
If it was mother's anniversary.. ..then you should've fed the paste to the cow or the bull?
The cow.
You think I killed my ex-boyfriend?
I think psychopaths are incredibly high-maintenance.
"If you care about your friend, go figure out how Alaric came into the icu on his deathbed and walked out an hour later without a scratch."
Fair enough.
I can't.
I can't.
Try harder.
Can't he just rest for one second?!
"We're doing this my way, Caroline."
"If you can't handle it, you should go."
"He's right, Caroline."
Just go.
No!
Tyler!
"Go, Caroline."
What are you doing?
"What the hell, man?"
Does it bother you?
Knock it off!
Good.
Get angry.
It's in you.
You know it is.
I said knock it off!
Your bond to Klaus is putting my daughter in danger.
"Now either you turn or I kill you right here, right now."
"You've grown into such a beautiful young woman, Bonnie."
"Please, just stop with the muffins and the compliments."
I just want to know the truth...
Why didn't you come home?
I had no magic.
"I was in a new city, and I realized"
I'm not negotiating.
And you understand that holding them indefinitely is the same thing as dropping them in the ocean?
"No, no, you leave Mystic Falls and then give me a call in a few years, and...We'll talk."
I'm going to give you another chance.
Just one more.
Let's make a reasonable deal.
Or what?
"You make one move, and I will..."
"Yes, that's right."
Crazy Stefan.
Mmm.
How's that working out for you?
Any friends left?
I just can't believe I'm actually going to see her.
Or meet her.
Sort of.
Since I don't really remember her.
You don't really talk about her.
What's to say?
"She left, never wrote, never called."
Not even when my grams died.
Can we talk about you and Damon instead?
I'm not talking about it.
He kissed me.
It's not going to happen again.
I mean...
Was it good?
It doesn't matter.
That means it was.
It's Stefan.
I told him I'd call him as soon as I got the address.
Ignore.
You want to ruin our country by selling the gold to the enemy!
"No, kaka sir! sher khan will lay down his life for his country!"
"But he won""t let this happen!"
Take the reward for your patriotism!
"John, Basheer will be at the port with the truck!"
Go and check! kaka sir!
- Yes!
We had already given the instructions.
That he should be at Aaram port with the truck!
"Pinto, you will remain a fool."
"You won""t understand anything. come on! come with me! oh God!"
"Pinto.. its not good to interfere. kaka sir, what are you talking about?"
Fool!
This gold is worth crores.
And John is no longer required.
Just think.
"You risked your life, you locked horns with Tiger singh.. ..and did this great job."
And John should get his share for doing nothing?
Now think.
"What is the need of John? oh! kaka sir, now I understood."
"We don""t need him!"
- Yes!
Tiger singh!
You are alive!
Good!
Good that you have come!
That Pinto shot John!
You are intelligent!
Use your brains!
Take advantage of this golden chance.
Become rich.
Let this launch go.
Do you think Selim could do such a thing?
- Can't we take a look at that newspaper?
- It's on its way.
What's wrong Perihan Hanım?
What do your in-laws want this early in the morning?
Hello?
My love?
What's the matter?
They say it's Reşat Yaşaran's son.
Who?
Give me a name and I'll strangle him!
They told me last night.
And it's on the newspaper this morning.
"Tell me who said that, and I'll sue that bastard."
"It's on the local newspaper, Münir."
Turaner Bey has just called me.
The news reached even him.
"Yeah, I know."
The girls fiancé has already told me.
- What?
"- He's here, he's gone crazy."
I'm trying to explain it to him.
- Damn it...
- But I'll find that man and make him pay for it.
- God damn it!
- I'm going to the prosecutor right away.
"Yes, of course."
Going to the prosecutor.
Don't get the prosecutor involved.
Don't get us deeper down.
"Don't you worry, I'll take care of it."
"Call you later, uncle."
Wait !
[ Groans ]
"Well, safer than a tube sock."
[ Sighs ]
"- Okay, that-- That was good."
- Yeah.
- See you at dinner.
"- Uh, yeah."
I'll see you at dinner.
"So, Finch, this is your plan ?"
"You know, I don't think girls are into the whole mini-golf thing."
"Kevin, I'm sure that they're not."
"Actually, there is one small matter that I need to ask for your cooperation in."
"- In the spirit of this whole pact, you know ?"
"- Sure, what do you need ?"
"Whatever you hear about me, you agree."
And tell all the boys the same thing.
"Look, I gotta go."
Sixteen minutes round-trip.
"You know, Finch, it's-- it's senior year."
"I mean, don't you think it's time you learned how to take a dump at school ?"
When was the last time you looked at the facilities in this school ?
[ Murmuring ]
- [ Grunts ]
- Excuse me.
"Uh, that's Paul Finch, right ?"
- Yeah.
"- Well, you've seen him in the locker room, right ?"
"- Uh, yeah."
"- So, my friends, they want to know."
Is it true ?
"You know, that he's... equipped."
Go to him.
Shailu!
You are still wasting time here?
Venkat is leaving the city.
- My God!
You are bleeding!
Were already in a lot of trouble.
"- What happened to you, dad?"
"This is nothing, baby."
He was very angry.
Leave that matter.
Venkat is leaving the city.
Go and stop him.
I tried to convince him to change his decision.
But he was very angry.
His anger was increasing every minute.
As a last effort I fell at his feet.
With out respecting my age he kicked me.
I hurt myself by falling on a stone.
I dont care if my body is hurt.
It will be cured in a few days.
But he hurt my heart.
He threw this ring to the ground.
Any way he is a man.
But we have to bare it.
If you go and fell at his sisters feet..
Not necessary.
"Listen to me, baby."
I am saying it is not necessary.
I dont want.. .. to fall at the feet of a person who rejected me.
"If he wants me, he will come to me."
He had a dispute with Bhadram in the past.
This is my first visit ever to the city.
-Really?
"-Yes, I swear to God."
But my son is living here in the city.
He is married to a lady from a very wealthy family... ...and he has an amazing child.
"Wait, I will show you his picture."
His name is Hamada.
See how cute he is?
How old is he?
A year and 6 months.
God wills.
He is cute like his grandmother.
This was in the past.
"You know, I have never seen him."
And he also gave me a hard time... ...till he gave me a picture of him.
When he come to visit me I asked him... ...why didn't you bring your son and wife?
He answer travelling makes my wife tired.
"Here I am, a very old lady... ...but people helped me to catch the train and come... ...and my son waited for me in the station."
But there is nothing we can say.
It's noday's lady's.
"By the way, what's your name?"
-Abdallah.
-God bless you.
You look handsome and have a good taste.
Thank you.
"Look, I will show you something... ...and tell me your opinion honestly."
Show me.
I got it for my daughter-in-law... ...and I am afraid that she don't like it.
"But tell me honestly, don't lie at me."
So beautiful.
Seriously.
"Yes, I swear it is beautiful."
I'll take a shower and go out.
"Okay, as you wish."
"- Good morning, sir."
- Good morning.
"Lawyer Necati Bey called twice, sir."
Thanks.
Good morning.
"Yes, yes, I just woke up."
So how did the trial go?
"Unfortunately, we didn't get the decision we hoped for."
- What?
- The lawyer took into account the last developments.
Until Mirza Çeltik's investigation is over... ... he was released by the court pending the trial.
So is he... is he free now?
God damn it!
He can't leave the country though.
Who cares if he can't go out of the country?
Is he out there and free now or not?
Aleykum selam... aleykum selam.
What are you doing here?
And how did you get in here?
What is going on?
What do you think you are doing?
How did you get inside?
"Come, let us have a talk with you."
What are we gonna talk about?
This was for Cemre.
Barış Bey!
Get up!
Don't!
Come here.
I had made you an advance payment before the trial... ...
Come on.
- I see.
"Call him, call him."
Where is he?
I have a even fresh matter today.
I will call him.
Grandpa.
Grandpa.
"Tanya, hi."
You didn't tell me that your grandpa is Albert Einstein.
"Shut up, okay."
My grandpa means everything to me.
"18 years ago when there was an earthquake in Indonesia.. ..my mom, dad.. - Do all scientists.. ..get their haircut in the same saloon?"
I will kill you.
Bunty.
Come on.
Grandpa.
How is my child?
"Grandpa, he's Bunty."
I am Gonsalves.
Anthony Gonsalves.
"- Hello, sir."
"Sir, what is this?"
This.
This is a time machine.
A machine that will connect us with our past.. ..and make our future better.
"A machine that will break the sound barrier.. ..and take us back, I mean to our past."
Time machine?
"Professor, they are are just film fiction."
"How can you make a time machine in reality, professor?"
"It can be made, we can make, we can make."
If we can see the past then we can also travel into the past.
She asked me to put her in touch with some juvenile delinquents.
But I am a juvenile delinquents!
She doesn't know that.
"To send her off, I introduced her to Sylvester."
He's most probably the one and only dumb-writed triad member in HongKong.
He's know for his capability to kill.
He's getting a real reputation for that.
Moon!
Moon!
Fuck you!
"How do you do, Mrs. Leung?"
Can I borrow some soya sauce?
Sure.
Come in!
I'll get it for you.
Thank you.
My pleasure.
"Moon, who's she?"
She's from the social welfare department.
A charming lady!
I won't charge you for this.
"Thanks...More, please."
Take the whole bottle.
That's too much.
He visits you often?
Not really.
He used to live in the shop he worked for.
But he lost his job.
That's why he hangs around with me.
He got bullied a lot on the street.
He has to find himself a job.
What and how?
You're driving me crazy.
Really.
Not something forced.
Something natural.
I got it.
I'll try again.
It was gym class.
There were students outside running around...
So we secretly went into the closet.
Pushed a girl onto a mat...
"But suddenly, the students were gathering, outside, the teacher is pounding on the door."
But we couldn't stop.
The girl's voice was getting louder and louder.
And the door was about to open.
But she was reaching orgasm.
I'll have Sam- gae-tang.
You don't even have any money!
Aren't you gonna buy me?
You just watch while I eat!
Don't drool!
You drive me crazy.
Really.
Don't pout.
"Alright, just for today."
You always treat me.
"Next time, bring some money."
You get free sex and now free food!
That's too much.
Sam- gae-tang.
Are you always so quiet?
I like people's voices.
Why are you so attached to talking?
After that?
- Weather report.
Who will give that report?
Gali Ganna Rao.
If we call him he can tell when it will rain.
9848032919.
This is my cell number.
Gali Ganna Rao.
This is my name.
People always misunderstand me and feel.. ..that I give them wrong information.
I only read the report given by the weather department.. ..but dont control the weather myself.
It will be good if you understand that.
Please call later.
Ok?
Catch!
"Sir, we are in trouble."
We did not still get the report which.. ..we are supposed to get by now.
- What shall we do?
Oh!
I see that you are new to the job.
You dont know about me.
Do you think that we depend fully on their report?
Now select one finger.
The pointing finger?
There will be no rain.
Go.
"Sir, there is a phone for you."
Who is that?
- A fan of yours.
This is Gali Ganna Rao speaking.
This is Gun the Gagan speaking.
Are you the person who gives the weather-related news?
"Hey girl, turn the oven off in five minutes."
Let it settle a bit as I am getting ready.
Then let us make a nice package for it.
"Yes, ma'am."
"Ebru Hanım, we've got a mail for you."
I am so excited to see Kuzey.
"But, also nervous that I will see Sami there."
"I mean, I can't go in before or after Sami."
Since we have limited time.
I will have to see his face.
"I know, he will try to talk to me when he sees me alone."
"But, I will not listen to him."
Why would I listen?
"God forbid, I don't want to give him any hopes."
"If he gets some hope and throws his ring away,"
I would feel sorry for the woman.
Ebru Hanım?
"- Who received the mails today, Hasan?"
"- I did, ma'am."
- Who brought the big yellow envelope?
"- A courier, ma'am."
"Barış, get up!"
Barış get up!
"I'm telling you to get up, Barış!"
"What did you do, huh?"
What did you do?
What's going on?
"Calm down, what did I do?"
Celebrated for the end of Ferhat case.
And getting rid of the Burak problem.
Is this how you want to get rid of him?
- What is the matter?
One wrong step from your side. ...can harm your daughter's honour as well as life.
Your enemy Jackie.
"Damodar, tell him something."
Have patience!
Your anger can risk her life.
"Before that I'll kill all of them, Damodar."
She's my daughter.
"She's not only yours, but all of us' daughter."
Give this to me.
Come to your senses.
"Aunt, reason him something."
Don't play with the laws and trust me.
After all I too have some duties towards this family.
I'll bring Radha back.
You please control him.
I'll call the police.
God!
What has happened?
Pasha!
Today you've challenged me.
I'll not spare you and your son alive.
IG Shreekant!
Now you'll understand my language.
"Well done, Jackie!"
You are lying.
You are not a police officer.
"Listen, try and understand."
- You are a liar.
I don't want to hear a word from you.
Get lost!
"Otherwise, I'll kill you."
I said leave.
- Yes.
But I'd still be good at it.
Really?
It's really big!
- Really?
- Yes.
For real.
- Take it out!
- What?
"Your thing, pull it out."
Here?
"Take it out, underneath!"
It's not so big.
"- Yes, it is."
"- No, It's not."
"When it's hard, it's really big."
I don't think so.
"Yes, it is."
It is big.
- Then make it hard.
- Here?
Hey...let's go somewhere else.
Don't make me laugh!
No way...
"That thing, I doubt it can even get hard!"
"No, It gets hard fine."
-What's your major?
- Astrophysics.
You go to a regional college and you think you're going to build spaceships?
"Well, not exactly make spaceships but we study the creation and evolution of the universe."
We also observe and research the cosmic space of the earth's mesosphere and
- planetary movements...
Hello...
I obtained permission for each one of you.
"There is not going to be any restrictions on the number of visitors, despite Mustafa's illness."
What illness?
We all know why he is here!
Okay...
Duriye..
Metin didn't say anything.
"That is, he is just saying it is protocol."
My son!!!
My son...
Son...
Son....
It is time for medication..
"Mustafa, son.. where are you going?"
We came to see you..
"Look, Asiye is here.."
Yasar is here...
Your mother...
Your father...
"You say that, but Mustafa doesn't recognize you."
We are going
My son....
How could they do this to you... how????
We... ... are such a burden to you..
If only Kadir could get out.. ... we won't stay...
"And, you won't even let us do any work."
We just sit around.
You are not a burden to anyone.
I am going to ask you something...
Are you not comfortable here?
Is the place too small?
Why are you giving Demet's letter to Kuzey?
- It will get on his nerves.
- What is it to you?
It's her who wanted me to do it.
How shameless of her to  write to him after what she did.
"Have you no shame, talking behind her back without know what really happened?"
"Isn't Demet your friend, too?"
"You're one of a kind, Cemre."
"You talk about shame, yet... ... you are here for your lover, as a married woman."
- You are really unbelievable.
- So are you.
"- Kuzey Tekinoğlu, right?"
- Yes.
Anything else?
"Well, three letters."
But I can give them to him.
You'll have to leave them here.
They will reach him once we check them.
Is that so?
Alright.
- The visiting room is upstairs.
- Thank you.
- Sami Tekinoğlu.
- You can sit.
Are we going to see him together?
- You will do as you were told.
- I was told nothing.
- Neither was I. - It's 15 minutes.
You want to see him separately?
"No, I will see my son for as long as I am allowed."
He can wait outside if he wants.
"Okay, we got it."
"I feel strong, you know."
"And clouds really should be white at least, and oceans should be there at the beach."
And who needs books when we've got speech?
And who knows what's in store for raw love?
"Life, a penny at a time."
"Oh, love, life a penny at a time."
"Love, life a penny at a time."
"Oh, love."
"[fireworks whistling, popping]"
man speaking native language:
"When I close my eyes,"
"I can see all different people in the world from town to town, from country to country."
"I can feel it, I can touch it, I can see it."
I feel like born again because of my haircut.
It's time to continue my journey.
man:
Who do you love?
Cathy:
"My silly boys, the Bobby-ells."
Okay.
What do you fear? man:
"Well, I guess..."
I'm fearless now.
"I guess my fear was that you'd get cancer, and you did."
"That you'd get it again, I mean."
And you did.
But it's over with.
So I'm fearless.

woman:
Go.
"Please, I need this job."
You're fired.
"Look, give me another chance."
You're fired.
"Parker, hello."
You're fired.
Why?
Dogs catching Frisbees?
Pigeons in the park?
A couple geezers playing chess?
Boss.
Not now.
The Bugle could show another side of New York for a change.
"We got six minutes to deadline, Jonah."
We need page one.
I don't pay you to be a sensitive artiste.
I pay you...
Still not now!
I pay you because that psycho Spider-Man will pose for you.
He won't let me take any more pictures.
You turned the whole city against him.
A fact I'm very proud of.
Get your pretty little portfolio off my desk before I go into a diabetic coma.
"Is your wife, she lost her checkbook."
Thanks for the good news.
"Please, isn't there any of these shots you can use?"
I need the money.
Miss Brant.
Get me a violin.
"Five minutes to deadline, Jonah."
Run a picture of a rancid chicken.
There is only one way we can reach the ship.
We have to go underwater!
"But if we do that, we may freeze!"
I'm prepared to die!
"If we make a hole in the ship, they will have to delay!"
You're right.
Here!
They made this for us to help us breathe underwater.
Young Sook!
Mother is going!
God of the Sea!
We are laying down our lives to save our daughter!
Please have mercy!
We... we made a hole in the ship!
It's our turn now!
Let's go!
What?
We can't leave today because of a hole in the ship?!
It will take at least a day to repair it.
"As of today, you owe me forty thousand yang."
"Goodness, awesome!"
Increase security!
"Seize any trespassers and torture them! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Yes, sir!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
In Soon!
Next!
- Choon Dang!
- Myung Shin!
The front has been fortified.
Go for the back!
Alright!
What do we do?
It's fifty thousand yang already!

Is this enough for my sister-in-law's birthday?
-Sister-in-law?
-Yeah.
-Who?
-Su-eun.
Since when has my sister been your sister-in-law?
We're not even married.
You who don't even have to propose...
Su-eun told me to call her that.
You're on your period aren't you?
Should I cook seaweed soup for her birthday?
I'm good at it.
"You fry up the beef, add a dash of sesame oil, you boil it with soaked seaweed... fantastic!"
She'll like it.
What do you think?
Let's rest a bit.
"It's hard on you, isn't it?"
Of course.
You make me carry these heavy bags.
Not that!
Then what?
Don't you think you can take it easy?
- I am taking it easy now.
- You've been doing it a long time.
And worked harder than anyone.
What was that?
It means &amp;amp;quot;l love you forever.&amp;amp;quot;
Doesn't it?
Sister-in-law taught me.
"It means, &amp;amp;quot;l love you, so let me touch your breasts!&amp;amp;quot;"
Huh?
Where do I live?
"- Jaipur, aunt."
So I am speaking from Jaipur.
But your voice sounds quite clear.
"So why are you yelling, you fool."
"Aunt, father has said.. ..that we should speak louder on a trunk call."
He's a fool.
Maybe you might know better.
But he will kill me.
If he misbehaves.. ..then throw him out of the house.
"But.. aunt, won't that be a bit too much?"
- No.
He drives my mother crazy.
But isn't your mother dead?
I am talking about my mother.
Don't you and father have the same mother?
"Oh, no."
He's the servant's son.
After the servant died my mother raised him.
What?
My father is the servant's son?
That means I am a servant's grandchild.
Ask Bhikhu.
Bhikhu knows about it.
- Yes.
Bhikhu is your father's brother.
"The servant of my cruel, low-down, scoundrel neighbour.. ..is my uncle?"
"Kishen, aren't you ashamed to abuse your neighbours?"
"Why shouldn't I, aunt, why shouldn't I?"
"The mother's a witch, the daughter's a specter."
"You know, last month.. ..they pulled down my father's loincloth."
Do you know that?
I will give you the rest of the payment today.
"Oh you were hungry too, right?"
Here!
Come here!
Don't call the police.
I will kill him right here  if you call the police or the security.
I was put in jail because of him.
"Come here, come."
Lion...
Get up.
Fight me like a man.
You were doing stuff behind my back.
Why don't you hit me once?
"Slap me once, just once."
"Hit me once to wind me up, come on!"
Get up.
We are not finished yet.
Get up.
May God accept your prayers.
I first found out that Mirza Çeltik's deceased son was your boyfriend.
And then I found his grave.
Then I tracked the fresh flowers brought here everyday.
And here I am before you.
Hello Komiser.
"You know Kuzey was released today, right?"
Mirza Çeltik doesn't have many days ahead.
You are trying to close Ferhat's case.
Why would I want that?
For the same reason you come here everyday with flowers.
I am not doing anything.
I will prove it.
I will prove it.
Millwall!
Millwall!
- What the fuck's he doing here?
"- Martin, sit down, son, sweet."
- That's it.
"Do as you're told, you mug."
- Fuck off.
Bovver.
You know we're gonna have to stop meeting like this.
People are gonna start to talk.
"So, what you doing up so late, anyway, on a fucking school night?"
Shouldn't you be at home with your pals... ...all shitting at the thought of us turning you over?
"What, did you have a lover's tiff?"
"Well, what do you want, Bov?"
Fucking Yank's an undercover journo.
He's at our boozer now.
"Tommy, you gotta give him the chop."
He's got them eating out of the palm of his hand.
"What makes you think I'd want to sort that out for you, eh?"
Because the Major's there too.
Stevie Dunham's in there?
"- Oh, thanks, Pete."
- Shut up!
History student my ass.
Who the fuck are you?
"Look, I'm sorry I lied about being a history major, but that's it."
- I'm not a journalist.
"- Well, it don't look fucking good, does it?"
- Why are you keeping a record?
- It's a journal.
I've kept that my entire life.
Are you working for the Times?
Must've gotten up really early.
I'm sleep deprived right now.
"But since it's our MV, I'm anticipating a good outcome."
And it's really fun.
I'll be sure to enjoy it.
Peace.
"Right now, we're in NY to film MV. on some bridge."
I don't know where this is though...
Him Chan is already shooting first for the MV on this bridge now.
This is my background scene.
It's awesome.
our solo shoots are over.
We'll film a lip sync all together as a group.
Lip sync like an image cut.
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.
Step back a little...yes.
A chatting scene.
Cut.
What's wrong with us?
"Now, what you do with this coffee is,"
Drink it in a sentimental way.
"Put it down, and pet it once like this."
And try touching the coffee cup here.
This one here?
"You know, something like this."
Put your coffee cup to...
"- You know what I mean? - oh, this one?"
"- No, no."
- Then this one?
Then touch that cup in front of you.
You're thinking of the girl that's supposed to be with you.
Harry sent me roses.
"So where you been, pal?"
You don't return my calls.
I've been busy.
Taking pictures of Spider-Man?
How's the bug these days?
"The less you see of that man, the better."
"Now, les all go into the other room and have something to eat."
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.
So how are things going at Oscorp?
They're great.
I'm head of Special Projects.
We're about to make a breakthrough on fusion.
"How lovely, Harry."
"Your father would be so proud, rest his soul."
Thank you.
"We're actually funding one of your idols, Pete."
Otto Octavius.
I'm writing a paper on him.
You want to meet him?
You'd introduce me?
You bet.
Octavius is gonna put Oscorp on the map... ...in a way my father never even dreamed of.
"M.J., could you give me a hand?"
"She's waiting for you, pal."
What do you mean?
The way she looks at you or doesn't look at you.
However you want to look at it.
I don't have time for girls right now.
"Why, are you dead?"
I've been kind of busy.
Taking pictures of your friend?
Why did you send her there?
What was she doing at your mom's house?
"What did you do to my daughter, tell me!- It's okay dear, okay..."
Mira?!...
Yaman did you take the exam?
Yaman did you take the exam?
"No, I came to you..."

"- What is all this about, Reşat Bey?"
- What do you mean sir?
Haven't you seen the local newspaper?
I am...
I am very sorry but I don't know what you're saying.
The party members have just read  your town's local news to me.
Explain to me what this rape scandal is about.
"They mention Selim's name in it, too."
You will tell me everything.
You will tell me what you did to Fatmagül.
Are you alright?
Back off!
They asked me to help the girl.
So I went to the hospital.
And I found out that the girl had an affair with Kerim.
Lies!
Don't give me bullshit!
Tell me the truth!
You just don't want to see the truth.
The real lie is what you see here.
This rape slander.
It's too much.
"Well... ...congrats on the Epstein account, Van Holden."
That should be a nice commish.
I bet your father's election had nothing to do with it.
"Fuck you very much, Todd."
"Gentlemen, if you will excuse me... ...I must partake, once again, in this restaurant's fine facilities."
Fucking lucky bastard.
What the fuck.
Matt Buckner?
Is that you?
"Jesus, Matt, you look like shit."
"Hey, Buckner, do you mind?"
- You said you'd hook me up.
- What?
"When I took the fall for you at Harvard, you said you'd hook me up."
"You gotta be kidding me, man."
"They were your drugs, and you said you had more to lose..."
- ...and that you'd hook me up if-- - All right!
"Yes, I said I would hook you up."
"Jesus, Matt, I--"
I'm in a meeting right now.
Call my office.
Talk to Cindy.
She'll make an appointment for you.
"You gotta be joking me, you spineless shit."
- That you'd hook me up if-- - All right!
"Yes, I said I would--"
- What the fuck is this?
"- Oh, this?"
- It's my ticket back to Harvard.
- Give me that.
I wouldn't do that.
I'll take a beautiful picture.
Stop smiling.
"Now, here we go."
Do you know where he is going?
Maybe New York or Paris.
Maybe we should make them meet before he leaves.
You know why none of the Dwarves hooked up with Snow White?
They couldn't tell her how they felt.
Not one!
They were all ashamed of being dwarves.
In fact...
"In fact, Snow White had a thing for short guys."
"When the Prince dismounted from his horse, he was goddamned... uh really short."
"This is a secret, but actually he was the youngest."
"The eighth, who was adopted away."
You know why the bitchy queen died so miserably?
She was tricked by the mirror!
"When you look at your sweetheart, you don't look with a mirror, you look with your heart."
What's all this about?
It doesn't suit you.
It's too heavy.
Hi!
What are you doing here?
I have something to say.
What is it?
I'll tell you later.
- Can't you say it now?
- Later.
"Oh, I better go."
I'll call you then.
I'll be waiting for you!
Hello.
Just wait.
Woman:
Here father.
(Man:
Is it clean?) Woman:
"Yes, of course."
Man:
Then do as I tell you.
Fold the sari into eight folds.
Woman:
"All right, father."
Man:
"And you, you count that she does it right."
(Boy:
"All right, grand-dad.)"
Man:
"One, two, three, four folds we make."
All the germs from the water we take.
Chorus:
"One, two, three, four folds we make."
All the germs from the water we take.
"Five, six, seven, eight folds we make."
Our drinking water safe we make.
"Five, six, seven, eight folds we make."
Our drinking water safe we make.
Woman:
"Here, father, your eight-times folded cotton sari."
Man:
So this is the cotton sari.
And through this we will have clean water.
(Applause)
I think it's safe to say that all of us here are deeply concerned about the escalating violence in our daily lives.
Please don't freeze me!
Please...
One Snow Maiden won't make a New Year celebration.
There.
And I say - it will.
Absolutely!
Today the Snow Maiden Will visit girls and boys.
"And she will bring them presents, And she will bring them toys."
So you are determined to see in the New Year?
Yes!
And you no longer need the old year?
"No, we don't!"
"Go ahead, see it in then."
But mind you: the little elephant will miss out on his Birthday.
How is that?
Why?
"He hasn't celebrated his Birthday this year, right?"
He hasn't.
And he won't.
Because you don't need this year any more.
But how will he do without his Birthday?
I wanted to give him ripe bananas as a Birthday present.
There won't be any ripe bananas either.
They'll stay green.
"My friends, I think we rushed events a bit."
And how!
"Why see in the next New Year, when there's still so much interesting left in this year?"
Sweet bananas and pineapples.
Oh yes.
And my Birthday.
Then the future hasn't come yet?
Not yet.
And when it comes back to me--
"And believe me, mate, it fucking does, that madness."
"I mean, when I hear, you know, the--"
"The roar of the stadium on match day, yeah, all the lads calling me down... ...to get pissed out of me fucking tree."
When I think of that... ...I think about getting back into it.
"And Shannon and Ben, they remind me."
There's more to life than all this.
"Get all those juicy details, mate?"
- Writing it all down?
- What?
- You fucking journo cunt!
- Oi!
Oi!
Oi.
- Sure you know what you're doing?
- He's fucking undercover!
- Don't tell him nothing!
"- I said, are you sure?"
What?
You already knew.
"All I know is he studied journalism, right, at Harvard."
But he's dropped out.
We found his journal.
Full of stories about all of us.
That's just a fucking diary.
Ned saw you at the Times with a couple of journos.
That was my dad.
He's the journalist.
You knew that.
"His old man's a fucking journo, and you knew about it."
"- Look, that don't mean nothing, Bov."
- You what?
"When I was at the war front, he saved my life once  so I brought him back and treat him like my own son."
You've ruined his hunting game.
Let's go.
Now.
I'm so afraid. * sarcastically *
What?
A prince?
He is nothing but a thug!
You are unworthy of being here!
You there!
Take your hands off of him.
What have I done to deserve this?
Are you saying even the deer is first for the prince?
Why you still...!
Take him out and lock him in the storage.
Yes sir.
"Is that you, Kwon-yoo?"
Please forgive me.
I've wrong you by not teaching the lower ones.
Please forgive me.
I told you to stay away from here 'til he leaves.
What?
What are you worried about?
Don't worry.
I hear you are not reading lately.
Is it true that you your time is consumed by hunting?
I was trying to broaden my view like  others by not focusing on study alone...
Was I really asking you that?
What is the reason you keep going to the Shin family's house?
Is it because of his daughter?
Only the Shin family...
She is the first one that I like...
Thank you.
Good day.
"Oh, I wish I didn't come here."
"Don't say that, I'm glad you are with Sami Amca today."
Sami Amca.
- How is Kuzey?
Is he well?
- He's alright.
- How is his morale?
- Make a guess.
Everyone has their own problems.
- He's not sick or something I hope?
"- No, thank God."
But he's not in good spirit either.
Don't worry you.
Look...
"He will be out soon, anyway."
The toughest part is over.
How do we know that?
The other man's case is a different one.
There's something about this place.
It fills me with hopelessness.
"No, don't say that, Sami Amca."
Try to think good things and good things will happen.
Kuzey will be free after the first trial and we all welcome him.
He will be with you in your nikah.
"Inshallah, did you give him the letters?"
I left them with the warden they need to control them first.
- Of course.
"- Okay then, let's go."
"""Every soul will taste death"""
"Kazım Beyefendi, in his last trip... ... asks for two things from you, our dear community."
What did I?
Didn I tell you not to see him anymore?
But who am I talking to?
God...
God damn both of you!
What if someone saw you together?
Huh?
"Call that ****, tell him to come here immediately!"
Right now!
He wants to break up.
"If you let a slander separate you like this, maybe you should break up."
"Really, just end it."
"- He wouldn't do such a thing, mom, would he?"
- Of course he wouldn't.
How can you even think that?
Did I do anything to you?
My memory about that night is so blurry.
I don't remember anything.
- Shut up.
- Believe me that I...
Shut it!
- Fatmagül...
- Don't say my name!
"- I swear, I didn't do anything to you."
- Shut up!
I don't want to hear your voice!
"- I can't do such a thing, I wouldn't."
- Shut up lowlife!
- I am not saying I am not guilty.
- Enough!
- I am guilty because I didn't stop them.
"- Back off, or I swear I'll kill you."
Hey!
Do something.
Build a wall.
Do you know my father?
- Yes we know.
"Hey, Salim!"
He is coming this side.
There is an auto coming behind.
Stop the auto.
Take it and go.
Will the meter work?
It will cost 5 rupees more than the meter.
Ok bye.
Good night.
Did she go?
"- Hello Salim, how are you?"
"Hello, Mr. Ranga Rao!"
Are you fine?
Do we look like thieves who steal rings?
No.
Because we sell the rings before you can steal them.
Did you get your Anarkali?
"Yes sir, by your grace?"
So are you daily going to the movies and parks with her?
Even that happened just now with your grace.
When is the marriage?
That too will depend on your grace.
"That is, should the girls father not agree?"
Why should you worry about the girls father?
I advise you to elope with the girl.
That will fix the father and you will enjoy the thrill.
"Sir, do you know what your greatness is?"
Ok.
Ok.
How are you holding up?
Oh.
I'll be fine.
"I'm not here to get my mom back, I'm just here to get her help."
So I hope you guys are hungry.
"'Cause, uh, food has always been my go-to icebreaker."
You have a really beautiful home.
You're so sweet.
Just like your mom.
You knew my mom?
Miranda was my best friend.
So you had a daughter and a best friend and you still left?
My best friend is why I left.
"15 years ago, a vampire came to town."
"Looking for you, Elena."
Looking for the doppelganger.
"No one could manage to kill him, so I lured him out of town and cast a spell to desiccate him."
Mikael.
He was an original vampire.
It took every ounce of power I had.
Almost killed me.
I recovered.
But my magic didn't.
My powers never came back.
And neither did you.
It wasn't that simple.
It wasn't?
"You cast a spell, put Michael down, then..."
What?
You had to teach Jamie how to drive?
"Cemre, you're back in your old neighborhood."
We'll see each other more often now.
- Don't say words that you will regret.
- Go to hell.
"You're nuts, girl."
I'm telling you.
Bye bye!
What are you doing?
It's so not like you.
Why do you even argue with her?
She does this just to annoy you.
And you swallow her bait.
She says Sami Amca insisted.
It's her who is dying to go there.
"Mom, sometimes I want to jump down her throat."
Let me tell you beforehand.
We can't give you February 14.
We're fully booked that day.
"Oh, what is on 14th of February?"
Valentine's Day.
Everyone wants to marry that day.
That's why.
"Okay then, give us any day that is available."
Not the 5th of the month though.
Kuzey's trial will be on that day.
How about 4th?
"No, let's do it after 5th."
So that Kuzey will be with us as well.
Of course.
13th of February is available.
But since 13 is considered unlucky... ... people don't want to marry on that day.
What is unlucky about 13?
"Bonnie, you're about to see your mom for the first time in 15 years."
I'm not letting anyone ruin that moment.
"Yeah, but he's going to keep at it until I pick up."
Fine.
What?
Where are you?
Bonnie and I are going to spend the night at the lake house while we wait for sheriff Forbes to give us some more addresses.
"You're kidding me, right?"
"No, Stefan, I'm not."
We need a night off from your insanity.
Klaus is getting antsy.
He knows I'm stalling him.
We need to move faster.
"Well, we're doing everything we can."
So could you maybe not call every 5 minutes?
"Sure, Elena."
Whatever you say.
How's life on the road?
- Scenic.
- How's life in Mystic Falls without any hybrids?
Boring.
For now.
"If you want any of us back, you just have to say the word."
There's no need.
I've been making friends with the town's civil servants.
"There's a deputy who's awfully chatty, but useful nonetheless."
Are you clear on what you need to do?
I've got it covered.
Can I help you?
Abby Bennett Wilson?
That's me.
Cute house.
Front side of the building Don't move
I'm five seconds away 4 seconds 3... 2...
What are you doing here?
Huh?
Are you okay?
I thought you were going to propose!
I thought you wanted a nice dinner in a fancy restaurant.
And we never play games with fires.
How could you not know that?
What?
"Hey, Lee Jin-woo..."
The movie's starting.
Shhhh.
"Hwi-chan, look at me."
Did you do your homework?
Then you better go home right away and do it.
Don't play on the computer.
"Do the homework first, okay?"
I have to stay here for a few days.
"You'll be fine on your own, right?"
You won't?
When have I ever not been alone?
"Yes, my Hwi-chan can do great on his own."
Your mom will do well too.
And I'll try to do better once I get out of here.
But you need to promise me one thing.
Show me your diary every day.
After school I went to the hospital to see Mom.
"Mom is hurt, so she has to stay there a few days."
Tomorrow I'll go to the hospital and show Mom my diary as I promised.
It's nice...
"Now Mom doesn't work late, she doesn't drink, and I can see her whenever I want."
I am happy that I could fulfil my promise.
I won't survive for long.
I might not live until your release from prison.
"But I pray that... ... you get back your son, Suraj."
From Ram Prasad Saxena.
You are my Moon.
You are my Sun... you are the apple of my eye
"The easterly brings hope, like the birds soaring in the sky"
"God willing, some day, you will fly with the clouds"
"And some day, I will be envied for having mothered you"
You are my Moon.
You are my Sun
It's ready.
Take it.
"What are you looking at, son?"
- Nothing.
I think that... you should come along with me.
I?
What will I do there?
This the happiest day of my life.
Won't you come along on this day?
Your mother and Renu will be accompanying you.
You will have to accompany me.
- I told you that I'm not coming.
All right.
If you don't come along I won't go either.
You shouldn't fuss.
I'm ready.
Let's go.
"- Renu, she is accompanying us."
It is your responsibility to get her ready.
I'm waiting in the hall below.
"Don't go this way, go that way."
"Down, down, down, drive on the road."
"Faster! - "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
That was a narrow escape.
"Now, take me to Brahmanwadi."
"Go straight then take a left, then right and another left."
"And you'll be home, go on."
"You brought me this far, so drop me home as well."
My job's to show the way.. ..it's your job to get to the destination.
Fine.
Keep it.
Thank you so much.
You're so kind.
- Thank you.
"Take care. "" Go...go...go...Govinda. """
Papa!
- Sushila.
ls everything fine?
"Go up and take a look in the house, you'll know."
"Thankfully we survived, otherwise.."
"No, I'll talk to the police."
Don't worry.
They hurled stones and acid bottles in our house.
I don't care lf I die.
But the children.
lf Jigna would've been hit by that acid..
I won't let anything happen to them.
I am their father.
Please.
"So, understand the duties of a father."
Withdraw the case.
- You're a fool.
Move. . . move!
Can't you hear the horns blaring?
Can't you hear so many horns blaring?
Thief?
Where is the thief?
Who died?
- No one died.
"Not thief, I said blare."
Are you deaf?
"You speak loudly, and very fast."
So I don't understand anything.
Your moustache covers your mouth.
Move your lips slowly.
"When I see your lip movement, I'll understand."
I don't understand easily.
God !
- What did you pick?
Show me your hand.
I didn't pick anything.
"You've met me here, don't meet me in heaven."
You live in that building?
Which floor?
The traffic has got jammed because of you.
Look!
Why are so many vehicles parked here?
"So many horns are blaring, can't you hear?"
Are you deaf?
The traffic has got jammed.
Are you blind?
Who called me blind?
Looks like a gang who calls me blind is out.
Who are you calling blind?
Enjoy this short life.
"Cemre, her mommies one and only."
My dear.
"Sweetheart, my fortune."
"Be so happy, I don't want anything else in this world, Cemre."
Be happy with the man you love.
And have joint purpose with him.
But have your own purpose as well.
"And have a beautiful girl, like I do."
What if it's a boy?
"A child is a child, canım."
"Boy or girl, doesn't matter."
But have your child from the man you love.
Like I did.
So how did it go?
You saw Kuzey?
Sami Amca gave him the cookies and the letter.
We didn't have a feast like that in a long time.
- Thank you brother.
- Afiyet olsun.
Thanks to everyone who helped bring these to our table.
"Come join us, brother."
Come sit with us.
"Don't feel left out, come on."
"Well, since you are our guest here."
I will accept your invitation.
Let's make the best of your short stay.
"God gave us our punishment, anyway."
"Let us not punish each other, too."
"- Come sit, let us eat böreks of peace."
- Thank you.
- Come sit.
A cheater!
"Today, before Damodar arrives... ...I'll tell you everything true."
What do you want to tell me?
Go on.
"Actually, I'm..."
I'm not your would-be son-in-law.
A charade has been played with you.
And I'm forced to play a role of fraud son-in-law.
"Actually, your would-be son-in-law is someone else."
Who's he?
- Today's race winner.
Jackie!
- No!
You can slap me or kill me.
I'll get the punishment of my deeds.
But this is true.
Mr. Bharat Singh has thrown a big party for Jackie's victory.
And Jackie and Radha are also taking part... ...in a stage program of that party.
And you'll be made a chief guest of that program.
I would like to see this truth.
I'll attend the party.
I'll definitely go.
Has father come here?
Radha!
I don't want you to sing with Kishan in the party.
There'll be a big confusion.
I'll sing.
"- Radha, father has come to known everything."
And no one else other than you could be there behind it.
"No, Radha."
I promise you.
I'm yours only.
Who is Rajesh?
My best friend!
"My school and college""s friend!"
"No matter how much I praise his friendship, its less."
ls that so?
You have never mentioned Rajesh before.
How can I mention him?
He has joined the police force!
"And I am just working in the shipping company. seema, when you are in front of me, I forget everything."
"Now don""t talk too much."
And come with us for a picnic!
Picnic?
- Yes!
How can I come for the picnic?
He is coming after a long time.
"He will feel so dejected if he won""t find me here."
"Good luck, sir!"
Good luck!
"lt""s the sign of your promotion."
"This is the first time that this jeep""s tyre has got punctured."
Rao.
"- Yes, sir."
"Don""t talk nonsense."
"Take out the jack from the jeep. sorry, sir!"
There is no jack!
There is no jack!
"Take out the spanner. sorry, sir."
"We don""t have that too."
"Take out the screw driver. sir, we can take out the screw."
"But it""s difficult to take out the driver. otherwise who will drive?"
"Rao, I am fed up of this!"
"How does your jeep work? sir, it""s a police jeep. lt works on its reputation."
Okay what page am I on?
"Okay, oh okay."
Sorry.
"There, okay, ready, ready."
Okay.
"A, is the following."
Negative four on the diagonal .
"Ready, ready."
This is what makes it complicated.
Once.
An occasional zero.
"And then 1s, and then, an occasional zero."
Okay.
We'll get it though.
"By the way its the same over here, one's occasional zero's, zero's one down from here."
So this zero.
Is in that first M by M block.
Sorry.
No its not.
"It's, one over."
Sorry.
That zero.
"There's an N by N block there, and then a zero, and then 1s."
"Okay, so fourth, and this one here, zero is, one down here, ones, so I got three rows."
Six more to go.
"Alright then we have these, this is all due to periodic boundary conditions by the way."
Why these appear.
Then you have these 1s on the corners.
And then these ones over on this corners.
Got five diagonals.
"Then I have some ones over here that continue, there."
Then I have some ones.
"You don""t fear the public."
"You don""t fear your parents."
At least fear the police.
ls it a crime to love?
"Hey, lover boy!"
Why do you love openly?
Think about the people!
"What happened, constable Rao?"
You both too come here!
"What happened, constable?"
"Don""t ask!"
lf I had not come on time today then.. ..your image would have got tarnished!
This ruffian was going to kiss your daughter!
"What""s the harm in kissing?"
Young people should indulge in kissing!
- Yes! shut up!
lf my daughter starts giving free kisses.. ..then who will give me dowry?
"Look, Mr. Rao."
"lf you can give me 4000 gm gold, then you can stay! otherwise leave!"
"You don""t worry, papa! l will load you with gold!"
"Don""t trust this ruffian!"
"Look, if you want to get your daughter married.. ..then get her married to a decent, reputed, educated guy."
Even if he is of my age.
"This is something to ponder over! sorry, sir!"
I am one minute late.
1 minute late.
- Yes.
I got to know 1 minute prior. oh!
"Then it""s a great loss, sir!"
"ln this one minute, I could have.."
At this age?
"- Yes, sir!"
What is it?
- I too dont know.
That is what I call extra speech.
I did not like your face.
"Salim, the scooter is not getting started."
Please kick start it.
If he likes someones face he will make..
Why does he have Shailus ring on his finger?
I had a similar ring made for my daughter.
She lost it somewhere.
Did you find it by any chance?
I was joking.
This is a girls ring.
Not good for you.
Your luck will be reversed.
Take it off.
"Oh, is it love!"
You must have that much passion.
But be careful.
If that father knows.. ..he might have your hand or leg removed.
His head will be removed before.. ..he decides between hand or leg.
His Anarkali is my daughter?!
Then why will she agree to become an actress?
She will not.
All of you come here.
Listen all of you.
"If all my debts have to be repaid.. ..and if you have to breath free air, then I must die."
Oh God!
Im coming to you.
How are you?
Bring some water.
What?
"On February the 4th, when the trial is over and you are free."
"I will hug you so tight, that... ... no one will be able to untie us."
Take care until that day.
I love you so much.
I love you so much.
If you want to be my girlfriend then you won't hold a weapon again.
- Zeynep.
- Let us go.
I said let us go.
Do I stick it in here?
We'll leave a row empty.
Then we'll add 4 rows.
Okay.
- Am I doing alright?
- You're doing wonderful.
"""Don't wait for me tonight."
"It's impossible for me come."""
"Now do the turns, and finish the crossed parts."
- How does it look?
"- It looks beautiful, canım."
The idiot dropped it at the house when he was fighting Kuzey.
I forgot that I kept it so that it wouldn't get lost.
Then I found it again in one of the boxes as I moved to my new place.
So I brought it  thought maybe it's something important.
You did well.
This was my father's.
Atilla Sinaner's.
He had bought this specially to give it as a present to Güney.
That fool couldn't hold onto it.
- One more?
"- No, I will go."
- Where?
Let's hope the best for them.
Amin.
"I told them, they shouldn't come all the way back here."
"So, I'll just have what will be delivered to Kuzey."
And I'll take it to them.
Boot licker.
That's good.
You thought well.
"Actually, Sami Amca wanted me to present at the jail as well."
"He said, it would make Kuzey very happy even if I'm just waiting at the door."
"But, I'll see."
Where did Sami Amca say that to you?
In your dream?
"Cemre, what are you talking about?"
Silly girl.
"I got used to it, Gülten Teyze."
This is just a sample of our dialogues with Cemre.
I bet you took a day off from work for this.
"Dear, why don't you go and put the cookies in the oven?"
I got some other stuff to do as well.
You don't worry about me.
"- So give me what you have, and I'll take it to them."
"- No need, I'll do it myself."
"What, are you going too?"
Come on...
"But mom, it's not ready anyway."
What should I do?
- Rush it while Zeynep is poising over me?
"- Well, I can't wait, if it's not ready."
"Also, she might put it into trash or change my letter."
"I won't take the risk, thanks."
"Okay, Cemre..."
Am I not dead?
You may stop me today and tomorrow.
But I will go one day.
No one listens to what I say.
I will listen to you.
Swear by your mother that you will listen to me.
Okay I will listen to you.
Will you become a cinema actress?
"No, no."
You must pose like this.
Are you a director?
You are shooting a photograph like a movie.
My money is hard earned..
Excuse me.
No smoking sir.
I am the father of the heroine.
Even then you cannot smoke sir.
"Let the movie succeed, then I will take care of you."
"Hi, Salim!"
What are you doing here?
I came for Anarkali.
Where is your Anarakali?
Dont play games.
Then give your daughter to me.
I will look after her very well.
I dont even know your name.
My daughter is a star.
She will be a heroine.
She cannot be the lover of a loafer like you.
There is a lot of gap between you and my daughter.
"Hey, you cannot even touch her shadow."
What?
I won't kill when they tell me to... ...or risk my life just bacause that's an orders.
That's sheer dumbness.
The most important thing is to yourself with skills.
That's my style.
You mistake us... we're ordered to collect our money.
Stop bullshitting me!
Where're you from?
We're from the Bank of Canton.
last time because I was late... it selling my account in a couple of days.
They were just do their job.
I just lost 2000 bucks to you.
Shut your fucking mouth!
Move!
"We didn't do anything wrong, did we?"
You want us to take off you?
Move!
Move!
Isn't it right?
Serve them right!
"Come on, go back to your room."
Serve them right!
Wait a second!
Who are you?
Mr.Wing sent me to collect his money.
What money?
Take a look at this!
Have you finished?
You think it's fake.
Just wanna make sure it's not.
"What's wrong with you, Sylvester?"
I know what's on your mind sex maniacal
What do you mean?
You crazy?
"Besides, the wardens will open and read it anyway."
Why wouldn't I?
Abla.
We're running out on detergent.
"Okay, dear."
Cemre...
Don't write silly things in the letter.
Remember the wardens will read it first.
"And don't write anything regarding the future, like so eager."
"- Just leave it to time, will you?"
- Okay mom...
It's Sami Amca.
We're gonna be late!
It can't be him at this hour.
Maybe it's the water guy.
Why would water guy come now?
What do you want?
- Good morning Zeynepciğim.
Come in?
"- No, thank you."
Sami Amca said you made some things for Kuzey.
I'll deliver it to him.
What do you mean you will deliver it to him?
- Are you going as well?
"- Are you, too?"
"No, I mean, they don't let him see people from out of the family."
Why do you go?
Sami Amca asked me.
So I must definitely go with him.
"And he went to the registry office to make application, with Aynur Abla."
"Oh, really?"
Bye.
Excuse me...
My brother?
- What's the matter?
- Where is he?
Tell me what's wrong.
I talked to the doctor and he told me everything was okay and he was stable in a coma.
Was his condition serious?
I haven't been told anything about a transfer.
"Shit, Malena."
- What's the matter?
- Son-of-a-bitch!
You son-of-a-bitch.
What is it?
I feel fucking fine.
What day is it today?
September 10.
"2001, right?"
"I mean I didn't sleep til 2007 or anything, did l?"
You were out for 2 weeks.
You know what?
I have a feeling things are going to get better from now on.
"Shit, this is the 21st century."
We can learn from what we did wrong in the 20th.
"Starting tomorrow, the world will be a better place."
Trust me and you'll see.
"Pablo, there's something I haven't told you that you should know."
THE APPEARED
We are just doing future value of annuities.
"And I'll show you now, why this is such a cool thing."
"And what I'm going to do is, I'm going to do two examples, both for future value of an annuity."
And whats the other thing we do?
- On 18th of February.
Sinaner Holding will make the opening.
We will ring the bell that morning.
- Shall we drink the coffee in my room?
- I need to attend to a meeting.
I need to make a few phone calls.
Then I'll be with you.
See you.
"Güney, don't you dare break Banu's heart."
- What do you mean?
"- Today, I saw you and Melda kissing."
If you want to continue your existence at home and in the company... ... you need to be careful.
Or you'll have no where to go.
You dodged a life there.
Geçmiş olsun.
Are you okay?
Thank you.
"God forbid, you could have died."
I could have.
"But I didn't, again."
"Pity, you failed again."
What are you talking about?
- Our case isn't closed yet.
- I know it isn't.
I'll talk to you about the photo-montage thing later.
- I will not stop until I expose the truth.
- That's enough.
What are you trying to say?
You know exactly what I am saying.
Don't forget that.
- What photo-montage?
"- Just leave it, he's being ridiculous."
I got a variety dream last night.
In that dream both of us were married.
Surprising!
I too had the same dream.
But first night was with Salman Khan.
I will never get married in this life.
What if I reject?
There are many other girls in the city.
If I am not agreeable to the below average beauty like you.. ..how could I expect any girl to like me?
I think I was a wall in my previous life.
That is why.. ..everyone is throwing dung cakes on my face.
"Jagan, come with me."
Where to?
- I will tell you afterwards.
Come with me.
Are you going to hit me there?
What happened?
You should not see.
Remove the hand uncle.
Sorry.
I know you very well.
That is why I said we will sit outside.
Please wait for a while.
We have to select the cards.
We can do that sitting outside also.
I wont do anything.
Come on sit down.
We should not believe this men.
Is this card nice?
No.
Look at this card.
Remove it.
"You don't want us to call the police, do you?"
"Doctor, he's going to kill my brother."
"Calm down, Malena, please."
The doctor isn't pressing charges.
Why not tell me what happened?
My father...
I don't know how he can still be alive...
"Excuse me, but you didn't get my message, did you?"
"After you left, your father's brain activity shot up."
"He's in a coma, of course, but his brain's active."
What?
I'm telling you that we didn't disconnect your father yet.
He's alive!
God!
The son-of-a-bitch...
The son-of-a-bitch!
"Calm down, Malena."
You have to think of your brother.
That's what I'm doing!
Please let me go.
He's going to kill him.
"Pablo, do you understand?"
Please.
Please.
Wait.
What is it now?
How can anyone hate like that?
And hurt another human being without feeling remorse?
What do you mean?
"I'm talking about the torture, the diary... the photographs of you with my father."
Let me go.
I said let me go!
This one here gets shifted up.
Ready to shift some stuff?
"Remember, we only have to do this once."
Right?
So its an upfront cost.
Okay?
It's your investment.
"And then, once you have it, you can have this forever."
"Anybody ever asks you, hey, I need to take with [inaudible] boundary conditions."
"You'd be, like, dang, I gotcha."
"You just take this matrix which you built in 2011 and you can apply it at any time in your life, okay?"
"Show your grandkids,"
Whatever.
All right.
Yes.
[inaudible] where that needs to go in there?
This one here?
Yeah.
Dang it.
"Didn't, did I?"
Where did it put it if you don't put it in there?
That's a good question.
"Let's just put it in, don't ask hard questions."
Alright.
That one's supposed to be there.
"No, no, no."
M minus one.
That's where it's supposed to go.
"I, I think it put it."
"Well, who knows?"
"That's, that's, sorry."
There we go.
What has happened to my son?
I've often told you not to join the Air Force.
You are my only child.
By God's grace your life was saved today.
If anything happens in the future what will I do?
Wasn't I right?
"Mother, nothing has happened to me."
Go home and make offerings at the Lord's temple.
And this also won't happen again.
- Quiet!
You speak as though you know what will happen.
God bless you!
Who is she?
The doctor has forbidden me to speak in excess.
You tell her.
I am Renu.
My father is a retired jailer.
Oh!
So you are Renu!
He had written to me about you.
"But, whatever he had written was not sufficient."
Do you know what the doctor has said?
He said that unless we marry soon I won't get better.
Oh God!
I'll go and fix the wedding date right away.
"Yes, of course."
I have selfish motives.
Once you are married you won't risk your life so readily.
Touch mother's feet again on my behalf.
Touch my feet when you are my daughter-in-law.
Vandana!
You!
Once I've asked my senior here
You will be sorry.
"Miss Mu, under the circumstances earlier..."
"You had no choice, and needn't worry about your oath"
"I've sworn,"
I can't take my word back now.
"If you don't like me,"
"I will have to kill you, and then I'll kill myself."
Do you want to be my husband?
I'm willing to marry you.
"Good day, my master."
Good day.
Master?
What kind of a master are you?
"It took us a while to locate you,"
let's go back to the palace.
I was about to bring Miss Mu to meet my parents.
Go ahead and tell them first.
We've found our master.
What kind of a master are you?
Be patient.
"After we've reached the bottom of the hill, you'll know when you see my welcoming party."
Who are you?
"We had a deal earlier, remember?"
"After we've reached Dali city,"
I'll tell you the details.
Senior.
Where's Tuan Yu?
Senior.
"Tuan Yu has killed the Red Python, sucked up its blood, and has now acquired ""Red Dragon Soul"" style."
I was no match for him.
What?
Are you sure you want.......
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
He rides across the nation the thorough bread of sin.
He got the application that you just sent in.
It needs evaluation so let the games begin.
A heinous crime to show of course.
A murder would be nice of course.
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
Bad Horse!
He's bad!
The evil league of evil is watching so beware!
"The grade that you receive will be your last, we swear."
So make the Bad Horse prideful or he'll make you his mare.
"You saddled up, there's no recourse."
"It high ho silver, signed Bad Horse."
- I don't know.
- Are you kidding?
This is great!
I'm about to pull a major heist!
"You know, the Wonderflonium that I need for the freeze ray?"
It's being transported tomorrow!
Armored car?
Courrier van.
Candy for a baby.
Do you need anything dampened or made soggy?
Thanks but... the league is watching.
I gotta do this alone.
Will you lend a caring hand to shelter those who need it?
How does he know?
Yes.
What you want?
When can we expect the rain?
Not at present.
- Why?
Because the pointing finger was selected.
Tell me correctly.
During the next 48 hours the state will not have any rainfall.
"You can dry clothes, dry chips under the sun etc."
Can we apply beer to the hair?
Do whatever you want and leave me.
Will there be rain at least after 48 hours?
This is a difficult question.
Wait a minute.
Select one finger.
Yes.
"There will be rain after 48 hrs, 6 minutes and 8 seconds."
Is the rain guaranteed?
"Yes, without doubt."
My finger never cheats me.
Since you asked so many foolish questions.. ..can I ask you just one?
- Go ahead.
You are inquiring so much about the rain.. .what seeds did you sow?
He is asking what seeds we sowed?
Tell him that it is the seed of love.
- The seed of love.
What?
The seed of love?!
Put the phone down.
"Hey guys, it will rain after 48 hours."
We all heard that.
My poor daughter!
What am I doing?
"He wants to be the king, but what is he doing?"
You mean the one who's stopping the ship is Sir Moonlight Black Hat?
"Yes, he's the one who helped both of us."
He's so cool!
So that's why he couldn't reveal his identity to me!
"This is all secret, so please do not let on that you know."
I'll be on my way now.
Wait!
Take me to him!
I don't think just anyone can meet him.
"In that case, please deliver a message for me."
"She says she respects you, Sir Moonlight Black Hat."
"You told her to not do anything, right?"
"Yes, but she said she wants to meet you."
She can't.
It won't be good to be involved with me.
We can't meet.
I really want to meet him again.
He seems like such a cool person!
"If I knew it'll be like this,"
I should have asked me for a business card!
So such a man existed?
He must be a true Joseon hero!
He disguises himself in the moonlight and rescued civilians in need!
I wish I could be like that too.
Then why don't you disguise yourself and go out in the moonlight?
How could I do that?
Why not?
You're a warrior who knows how to fight.
He's Sir Moonlight Black Hat.

"Look, Sonakshi Sinha."
"She is Rowdy, my Rathore's in the next alley."
Let's go.
Come on.
"- All right, all right!"
- Come on.
- What are you reading?
- Chekhov.
- Why?
- He's funny.
- You laugh too much.
Go read the Counsellor's Magazine.
Deal with your inexperience.
- And here's the Queen of the Fields!
"Maestro, music!"
"- Well, hello there Corn!"
- Did you win a cake at the factory?
- Yes I did.
- And a cake from the post office?
- Yes I did.
"- And you'll win a cake here, too."
- Indeed.
- We sure won't be giving a cake to some Puss-in-the-Boots.
"- Comrade Dynin, these days the legumes are mentioned a lot."
- Maybe the bean pod will be better?
- Then they would have done so at the factory.
Don't you worry.
- Same old costumes all year 'round.
So tired of seeing them!
"- Well, don't look at them, then!"
"- Seriously, why can't kids make their own costumes?"
"All you need is some construction paper and glue, that's all!"
- And our pride?
Are we so poor that we wrap kids in construction paper?
"Let's better pick who should be our ""queen of the fields!"""
- That's easy:
It's all a disgraceful lie.
She came into my office and tore off her clothes.
Who's to believe that?
I'm disappointed.
What you did was inadmissible.
I've worked here night and day for three years.
- I sacrificed my marriage.
- Your divorce changed you.
I was just congratulated on our sales.
Which you owe to colleagues like Ms Limmer.
Don't you get it?
Ms Limmer wants my job.
"You're paranoid, Mr Fuchs."
Now what?
The consequences are quite clear.
You want to fire me?
I'll take you to court.
I know of similar cases.
You don't stand a chance.
Who do you think you are?
I won't stand for this!
Leave my office at once.
What if he goes to court?
He'd be in more trouble.
"Brigitte, don't forget you stand to profit too."
Ms Limmer.
- Are you feeling better?
"- Yes, I'm all right."
"If you need anything, you can call me any time."
That's very kind.
Thank you.
I don't think Rex has earned his ham roll today.
The view is great.
When I earn a lot of money
It'd be nice to visit with family.
"There's a pool, a gym with treadmill, a spa,"
"A great view, and so many rooms."
Haven't you all been to places like this?
When I travel with family or with friends
I've been to places like these so I'm quite used to it.
How many rooms are there?
I'm used to this.
"Please be quiet, curly head."
What is Zelo's concept today?
How awesome.
"Zelo's concept is a Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven kind of feel."
The prime of music!
Not Rome...
"Zelo is to be a composer from Vienna, Austria."
He can't hear.
"He can't hear, but he's writing out what's in his head."
I don't think he can play the piano.
Why are you filming my feet?
I'm embarrassed...
Dae Hyun has sexy feet.
He's a man with sexy feet.
My feet turned ugly from dancing.
I have calluses.
- That's what's pretty.
- The trace of life!
It's beautiful.
My feet have gotten dauntless.
Zelo has flat fleet.
- I don't have flat feet.
"If you do, I'm going to shoot you."
This is great.
-Look at that.
"-Oh, that's a legion of elephants."
I'm going to enjoy a real safari after not having one for a long time!
Huh?
Are you guys really going to shoot real elephants?
There was a passage behind the waterfall.
We can just say that we thought this place was also a part of the park.
Atom!
Don't cut in.
This is the place for perfect aim.
Pura!
Zora.
Good!
Zora!
I'm going to fight you!
"Here, Pura."
Now it's time to say goodbye.
Go ahead.
You can be happiest when you are with your kind.
I had no idea there was this kind of natural passage behind the waterfall.
I should have investigated it more thoroughly.
"I just didn't know about this passage, but Pura's mom was..."
She's beyond recovery now because of Zora.
"No, it's all good now, Doctor Hura."
"Ah, that's right!"
Let's build an ocean safari next time.
It will be a great item!
Cannibal whale this time?
Don't invite me.
Atom!
"If you hang up, I will resign his job.. .. and become a wayside astrologer."
You are not fit even for that.
O God of rains!
Till today I thought.. .. that only farmers pray to you.
But now even lovers are praying to you.
"Dont you have mercy, O God of rains!"
The moment we hung up there is thunder and lightning.
This means that there will be rain.
Hurray!
It is raining.
"Hey, stop."
She said that she will meet when it rains.. ..but did not tell when and where.
I am getting tense and cannot understand what to do.
It is me who should understand.
Why are you overacting?
Shut your mouth.
I know where to go.
Grandmother!
Did I not tell you?
The rain is here.
Yes I see that.
Leave me.
What is the use of holding my hands?
Go and hold the hands of that boy.
Where will you meet him?
You did not even decide on a place to meet.
I dont understand.
It is me who has to understand.
Not you.
I understood completely.
I will leave now.
Bye.
"Welcome, sir."
You can go to bed.
I will attend to my guest myself.
"Of course, sir."
Good night.
"Wow, this place is super."
You like it?
I can't believe it.
Cemre must be stupid to leave this place.
"Yeah, and she left for another stupid person."
She turned her back on me because of stupid Kuzey.
"""My daughter, Cemre..."""
"""... if you are reading this letter..."""
"""... that means I gave my last breath."""
"""And that I left this world with a great guilt of conscience."""
"""Last time we spoke you said you didn't want to see me again."""
"""You were rightfully angry at me."""
"""I didn't have much to say back then."
"As don't have now either."""
"""After all those years, I know it is too late to--"""
"Okay, I'll read it later."
Thank you for coming here.
- It was my job.
- You did your job successfully.
Kazım Bey...
"I don't know what he told you and in what degree, but... ..."
I have never asked anything from him... ... for neither myself nor my daughter.
- I know.
- As I told him back then as well... ...
I wanted to Cemre for myself.
And that's the best thing I've ever done.
"No money, nothing could match it."
"If I'm to know my boundaries again, I need to have a last time."
I'm not a fool.
I'll go back behind my boundaries after that.
"Young Master, why are you following me?"
I'm not following you.
I'm just walking.
But Yongmun is all the way over there!
I don't want to go there right now.
Have you run away?
Or are you in trouble with Madam Noh?
"Well, you're higher up than her, so I guess you won't get in trouble."
Did you have an argument with her?
Madam Noh cannot argue with me.
"You know, I was always curious, but how come you're higher than Madam Noh?"
You're younger and don't do much.
Why do you order her around like that?
What is the relationship between you and Madam Noh?
Madam Noh is like a mother to me.
"Who are you anyway, Young Master?"
I've known you for over a year.
But I don't know what you do.
I don't even know your name.
"Like you said, I've run away."
But I have nowhere to go.
"I don't do much, so I won't be missed."
Why don't you teach me how I should spend the day?
"If so, I'll tell you my name."
"First, my surname is Yi."
Young Master Yi?
I'm hungry.
Shall we go eat something?
"Great idea, Young Master Yi!"
Keep them under your pillow.
Just eat your fucking breakfast.
"If this happens again, I swear on my mother I'll beat you to hell."
"- It won't happen again, abi."
- Shut up.
Pour the teas.
Fucking idiot.
- Abi.
- What?
I'll wash clothes once the cleaning is done.
- Give me if your clothes need washing.
"- It's okay, young one."
I can paddle my own canoe.
But this is our tradition here.
It's my job.
I am not good with traditions.
Thank you.
Is this why your neck is thick?
Because you do things on your own?
I don't know if my neck is thick.
But my hand is heavy.
"Oo, tough guy."
Leave him be.
- You turned on the oven?
- It's on.
"Did you have to do this, I mean, as if you're racing Sami Bey."
You're making cookies for him.
- His father will be offended.
- It's not the same thing.
I want him to eat something I made with my own hands.
If your cooking improves until Kuzey gets out maybe we should open a pastry for you as well.
He won't be staying for too long in there.
You will die in my hands!
But I swore I wouldn't get involved with you again.
"I said leave me, leave!"
I don't use any opportunity .
I don't look at anyone's wife or girl either.
Put this in your goofball head.
Did you get me man?
EPlSODE 5 - Leave me !
What can you do man alone?
"Come on, do it!"
"Mira is my friend and whenever I want to be with her, i will be ."
Got it?
Now get out!
Don't dare to come here again!
What's going on here?
Nothing...
"I came to thank him for helping in the club, but... alas..."
I forgot that we don't talk the same language with our friend.
"It'm not at fault, but I'm sorry for disturbing you.Good night."
What did we talk with you Yaman?
This man came to my door.
What's his trouble with you?
"It's okay, nothing."
"- If you're right you will tell what happened, why do you keep quiet?"
We've solved it already .
There is nothing to tell.
"Come on Ender, anyway we have more important things to do, let's go and talk with Faruk."
Come dear...
Subtitles brought to you by Ebb and Tide Team @ Viki
Thank you.
"What is it ,dear Ender?"
"As soon as you heard ,did you also come to ask for your money?"
These people will be like this only.
What a big house this is?!
You have seen only the outside.
Now see the inside.
It will be great.
What is this?
"I am afraid of dogs, sir."
Thieves must be afraid of dogs.
Why should you be?
That is why I am afraid.
He is counting notes by the heap.
The boss is coming.
"Boss, this mans name is Kona Ranga Rao."
A good friend of mine.
He came to seek your help.
Dont be afraid.
A blood relation started between us.
Ask him.
"Sir, I tried various businesses in different parts of the state."
I also tried different precious stones.
"When I was that my fate would never change, I met you."
Ask him a loan.
"Sir, I need some financial assistance from you."
Uncle!
The God has granted the wish but the priest created hurdles.
Take this.
"Sir, you helped me as soon as I asked."
If you please visit my home for dinner.. ..
I will repay your kindness.
"Hey, why will he come to your house?"
Stay within your limits.
"Uncle, he made the request himself."
Really?
Then why did.. - Marry you?
"Yes, tell me, why did you marry me?"
Don't keep taunting me.
Anyone can commit mistake.
"Yes, just like your parents did."
You.
- Mala mind your tongue.
Or else.. - Or else?
- Or else.
- Yes.
Or else.
- Or else what?
"Hey, get back to work all of you."
Get to work.
"Bhikhu, you do your work as well."
Should I do all the work?
I can't even fire him.
People get motorcycle in dowry but what did I get?
This servant.
Who can't even dream of doing any work!
Be thankful that you at least got him.
Stop it
What is this?
It took you 20 years to realize your dream.
To turn your hotel into Bollywood Caf.
For this?
So that you can utilize every nook and corner of this place to argue.
"For god sake, your staff laughs at you"
"'God, please show me a way to stop mom and dad's arguments forever.'"
"Why did you bring me here, Tanya?"
So that you can explain to my grandpa.. ..why you're allergic to marriage.
Please welcome the first lady of the United States of America - Michelle Obama.
[song: ladies night]
[cheering applause]
"..how are you? ah, well welcome"
I'm so happy to see you again.
"And you still, you still moving."
"I'm trying to, trying to move."
"You're moving it, you're doing it."
You still got the moves.
It's all about movement.
Let's move.
"We're trying to get people up and dancing, dancing is a great way to lose a little weight, be healthy be healthy, be happy."
You are demonstrating it every day.
"I, I try to promote it every day."
I like to move.
"It doesn't matter how well you move, it's just moving."
You're good though.
"You're, you're a good mover."
"But, still I, I think maybe still better than your husband."
I hate to say it.
"I, I'm sure of that."
[laughing]
Yeah.
He tried to dispute it when he was here.
He's rural.
"Yeah, yeah."
[laughing]yeah.
I think we have proof.
Yeah
We do have proof.
"No, you're definitely a better mover."
"Ahm, well"
"Because well, it's very important!"
Come on...
We're going to Ankara.
"- Perihan, you get prepared, too."
- I'm not coming.
- What do you mean you're not coming?
We should be there as a family.
- I am not coming!
"I can't lie, looking in their eyes."
You go.
What are you waiting for!
Go!
And you go find out if it's that journalist who put it on the Internet.
"Go, we're doing all this for you."
It's all in vain...
It's too late.
Everyone will know it by tomorrow.
I don't know how we'll recover from this.
Make a call and sort out the tickets.
So that we depart as soon as we get to the airport.
And tell Perihan not to talk to them.
"If they know we're going, they might refuse us."
"""It's on the news and Internet... ... we've got to talk!"""
They are gone.
They ran away.
"""Münir Telci Law Office."
We can't answer your call right now.
"Please leave your message after the tone."""
"God damn you, Münir Telci."
This is ridiculous.
Throw dirt and hope it sticks.
"You've been doing that to the Yaşarans for years, I know."
I am very happy.
I have invested 14 crores in the movie.
If you had not brought her I would have been doomed.
Take these 10 lakhs.
I dont need 10 lakhs.
Only three lakhs is enough.
"Oh, you do not seem to belong to this age."
He is saying no to money.
I need to send this money urgently to Vizag.
Can you make any arrangements please?
When he is requesting us why do you stare with an open mouth?
Move now.
I will have it done.
Are you looking for Venkat?
- He is upstairs.
He is taking money from the producer for bringing you back.
He must have taken five or 10.. lakhs not thousands.
This is true.
I swear by my mother.
Dont try to cheat me anymore father.
You told me that he threw the ring down.. ..and I stayed away from him believing you.
Now you are telling me that he took money.
Even if he took money they would be the strong reason for it.
I will believe only Venkat and not you.
Why are you backing him?
Do you know how much trouble I took to make you.. ..a heroine?
Will you now go away with him?
What will happen to the movie?
Come with me.
Wait.
Leave her.
I left her.
Fire Alarm!
Look at you...
"Now that I'm sick, You seem to study harder and don't get into trouble."
I think I'm getting better because of you.
Really...
"Then Mom, can you come in front of our school?"
School?
Why?
You know how mothers direct traffic by the school.
Can you?
Sure.
I wish I were sick instead of you.
"If you ever say that again, you're not my son."
My baby is sick.
"Please, please let me be sick instead of him."
-Why do you make women cry?
- Huh?
"Oh, you saw it?"
"I didn't make her cry, kiddo."
"By the way, what's with your long face?"
Does your girlfriend want to break up?
"Or, you want to break up, but you're having trouble saying it?"
You're too young to be making that kind of face.
"When you get old, you'll have plenty of chances to be sad."
"Mister, what do you do anyway?"
Me?
"To keep the one I love,"
I make other couples break up.
What's that supposed to mean?
You wouldn't understand...
Here.
"Take this, in case you need it later."
"What am I gonna do, huh ?"
Broadcast her over the lnternet ?
- Yeah.
- You can do that ?
[ Scoffs ]
No.
I cannot do that to her.
"Jim, get some fuckin' balls."
"If you don't have the guts to photograph a naked chick, how you gonna sleep with one ?"
"I don't like the kid, but he's got a point."
"See, even shit-brick knows you should do it."
All you gotta do is set up some sort of private link or whatever on the 'Net... and tell me the address.
You can send me the address too.
I'll save you a seat.
"- How sweet it is to be loved by you, by you -"

"Okay, that was good, but I want to thicken-up that solo."
"Michigan State is this Saturday, and I want that part to smoke."
"Yeah, I know, my timing's off."
"No, it's not that."
I think it'll work better as a duet with a tenor part.
I'll do it.
- [ Whispers ]
Dick.
- I'll do it.
Great.
See you tomorrow.
Hmph.
- Why are you doing this ?
"İnşallah, inşallah."
"I mean, I'm not getting out of your livesafter the lawsuit ends."
I told Meryem Hanım as well.
I see you as my family.
I hope our faces will smileafter the trial as well.
We're just leaving the house.
"No, we'll get there in time.Don't worry."
"Okay, will do, my dear."
"Your enişte is saying hello to you.He's already there, waiting at the airport."
- Take care sweetie.- Have a nice trip.
Thank you.
Bye bye.
Don't pout.You are going away from hell.
- May God be with you.- Have a good trip.
"- There you go, miss."
Your bill.- Thanks.
You're welcome.Have a nice day.
You too.
Doing as I'm told.What else could I do?
"As you said, we delayed the abortion.We'll do it tomorrow."
As if I don't have enough to deal with...
"But I am telling you, Münir.When this is done... ..."
I'll be done with this womanno matter how much money you offer me.
"Okay, okay."
I got it.
When is your trial?
"Okay, call me when it's over though."
You too.
"Who are you?Who are you, God damned man!?"
"- Stop yelling at midnight!- That bastard bought you as well, didn't he?"
God damn it!
You are Münir's man.God damn you!
And I thought... how that was the same body as the one that had... held me so many times before.
And... we didn't say a word.
They took him away again.
I remember I cried because they'd taken away from me the only thing that gave me hope.
"In 1982,"
I came here... to Tierra del Fuego.
I opened this storage room... and I... tried to forget.
"But... the doctors had nothing to do with that, right?"
"Yes, there were... military doctors making calculations."
They... measured the voltage people could take from the cattle prod.
"In other words, they measured the amount of pain a human being could take without the heart stopping."
It isn't here.
Come here.
You're alive!
You're alive!
Let my daughter go!
Let her go!
Let her go or I'll kill you!
I said let her go or I'll kill you!
Put that knife down!
- Put it down!
- Please let her go.
It's okay.
- Please don't take her.
- Where are the others?
Who?.
Please don't take her.
Let's get out of here.
Please don't take her.
"Let her go, you bastard!"
"It's okay, honey."
You'll be okay.
Please leave this place.
Shailu is mine.
Bhadranna!?
I can die ten times for Shailu.
Can you die once?
"I am ready, what about you?...Are you ready?"
"Uncle, why are you supporting him?"
I called you from vizag to convince him not to support him.
Why are you being hasty?
I will talk to him.
Why do you interact with that rowdy?
What is the necessity that you want the girl he loves?
He wants the girl I love.
Have you seen how arrogantly he is speaking?
Do one thing.
Leave this city and come to Vizag with me.
I will not come.
Dont talk like that.
Why do you want to stay here.. ..and have a dispute with that rowdy.
Why do you try to scare me?
What if he is a rowdy?
What is his specialty?
I am also a rowdy.. .. if anyone tries to interferes in my matter.
Beat me.
I kicked my mother when I was a kid.
She never beat me.
I kicked my father when I have grown up.
He never beat me.
You shouldnt have leaved him brother.
You must have killed him there itself.
What is the need for that?
He only announced that.. ..he can die ten times for her.
"Not to mention, your Jedi friends caused an unspeakable amount of damage!"
The bill must be paid!
"Oo, I have an idea, how about we DON'T pay the bill?"
"Qui Gon, you old piece of shit!"
How are you?
"What's the matter, old buddy?"
You face is crustier than a patch of wookie butt fur!
Gross!
"Whoah, you look terrible"
"Maybe you need a Viagra prescription... ...to turn on your lightsaber, you know what I mean?"
This kid doesn't.
"Seriously though, are you losing your edge or what?"
You're absorbing more abuse than a hutt tampon!
(sorry)
The Qui Gon I knew would have been kicking my teeth in right now.
"Hey, I'm just kidding, it's all in good fun."
Put 'er there!
(laughs)
"Alright now get out of here, you old creep."
Why don't you take this kid with you?
I know you're into that.
"Seriously though, kid, watch out for that guy."
He uh... he has a past.
Look at him.
Such a... bumbling creature.
So foolish.
He's made of so much skin.
I will make him part of us.
Yes!
I will wear his face!
Look how much the others hate him!
Almost as if they wish he was gone.
"And only after that call themselves lndian! very good, dear!"
I am glad to see your patriotism!
Ms. seema.. your patriotism has cast a spell on me. can I expect to have one more meeting with you?
"lf it won""t happen, then it will be my bad luck."
"You have come so close, that staying apart is out of the question."
Thanks a lot.
"Mr. Diwan, give me the permission to leave."
"Thank you so much for coming, Mr. Rajesh."
Thank you very much for the nice food.
Yes!
"- Hello! sP Rajesh please! sorry, sir! sP sir is not here!"
There is a gift for him.
You can take it. keep a close watch on all the trucks.. ..passing through Dharampar road.
"What""s your name?"
- A patriot!
Hello!
Today I have nabbed you!
"- What happened, constable?"
You will find out soon! search the truck! okay! - come on!
Why is this truck empty?
"lt""s not a crime to drive empty truck, constable!"
"lt""s a crime!"
This truck is used to deliver goods.
"And it""s a crime to drive empty truck."
"Henceforth I shouldn""t see it empty!"
Got it?
"Let""s go!"
"When I signaled you to stop, why didn""t you stop?"
I am sorry.
"I didn""t see the signal. okay!"
We will find out soon! constables! search the truck and frisk them! sure! sure!
Hey!
Your bun has so much red bean paste!
Just give me one bite.
At least give me some red bean paste!
"Choose the cup, choose the cup!"
Double your money!
Double your money!
Choose the right cup!
One bet!
It's this one.
- How did you know?
- I have quick eyes.
- Well done!
Good job!
- That's enough.
Don't I look funny?
Funny!
Funny!
"This one must have married this one, and given birth to this one!"
Look at how plump they are!
The police has to know I'm alright so that they'll stop chasing him.
- Who are you?
- Your father has asked us to find you.
The Councilor will soon be here to fetch you.
Tell the police to stop chasing the thieves as I am alright.
You were kidnapped by the thugs that attacked the police.
Are you sure you're alright?
Don't you understand that my father wanted you to find me before the police so that there would be no rumors spread?
"If you tell Eun Hye that I know about Hong Gil Dong, you will not go unpunished!"
Eun Hye!
- Father!
- Are you alright?
- I'm alright.
So plus 5.
"5h plus 5, and that is choice C."
"And if you try it out with these points, it should all work."
"OK, next problem."
Let me see.
I think this cutting and pasting works out well.
I think I have time for at least two more.
"OK, let me clear this."
Clear this one right here.
Let me paste it in.
"OK, it says, some ordered pairs for a linear function of x are given in the table below."
It's kind of like the last one.
Which of the following equations was used to generate the table above?
Well we could do the same thing we did the last time.
"We could say OK, this is going to have some relation."
You know y is equal to mx plus b.
It's going to be a line and this is the slope y-intercept form.
And they tell us it's the linear function.
So that's why we can immediately say that's going to be a line.
There's no x squared or anything like that.
So a good place to start is just with the slope.
So slope is equal to change in y over change in x.
So let's see.
"When x goes from 1 to 3, what does y go for."
It goes from 1 to 7.
So change in x is equal to 3 minus 1 or just 2.
And what's change in y?
7 minus 1.
"So that is equal to 6 over-- oh, no."
Sorry.
Change in x was 3 minus 1.
Sorry about that.
Where would I go?
And what would I pack?
"Oh, it's going to take me forever to do all of that packing."
What are you supposed to pack when you go to exile?
Are you supposed to pack warm?
Opal?
"Opal, how did you get up there?"
"Hang on, you poor dear!"
Mama's coming!
Rainbow Dash?!
How dare you strand my poor Opal on the tree.
"Well, how else were we gonna get you out here to show you... ...this!"
What is it?
It's not...
You...
We all finished your dress for you.
Thanks to Fluttershy's freaky knowledge of sewing.
Do you like it?
Like it?
Like it?!
Uh-uh.
She doesn't like it.
"No, I don't like it."
I LOVE IT!
You ponies did an amazing job.
It's exactly the way I imagined it.
We just followed your brilliant design.
Like we should have let you do for our outfits.
Those first dressed you designed were perfect.
We're so super sorry.
You worked really hard to make our dresses exactly the way we wanted them.
We all saw how well that turned out.
- My childhood spent with it's tunes.
My father used to play these tunes.
You know what?
I'll miss you all a lot.
Really?
- Yes
And listen!
"Do come to my house once, okay?"
My father is a very nice man.
You know what?
"In my childhood, he used to make me cry a lot."
"He used to say, I'll get you married with a police officer."
I never like the police officers.
What will you say them now?
Now?
"Now, I'll say... fine..."
I like one police officer only if he stops smoking.
Smoking?
- Yes.
You...
Really?
Really?
What if I wasn't a police officer?
Still...
But before encountering them it's very important... ...to bring out Radha safe from their clutches.
"But the problem is that if police will arrest them... ...or attack them, they'll shoot Radha."
Or they'll point gun at Radha for their escape.
"I think so, sir."
"Sir, I've got one idea."
What if we go to them in the disguise of goons... ...and attack them?
- Yes.
In that case they'll escape safely with Radha.
- What?
Go with the police and immediately get shekhar arrested.
"No, no!"
"I can""t do this!"
Then be prepared to go to the prison!
"Ms. kitty, there are only two ways in front of you!"
You can choose any one.
Fine.
I will go with the police. very good! very good! shekhar!
I want my share!
- I too want it!
I too want it!
- I too want it! shut up!
"Tiger doesn""t listen to nonsense!"
And he is not a fool that he will hand over.. ..goods worth lakhs and crores to you all! so that you all fight amongst each other!
Everybody will get their goods when the time is right!
When will that time arrive?
I have been after you for 3 years!
"And you don""t listen to me!"
I made a sale of 15 million pound in your diamond!
And in return..
I will never spare you!
I will never spare you!
"Why don""t you give us our share?"
"Remember! lf our boss found out then he won""t spare you!"
And our boss will follow you!
"You don""t know!"
"He doesn""t like deceit!"
He will not spare you!
He will kill you!
Tiger kills people!
And gradually you will find out whom Tiger wants to kill!

We're dead!
"- If Mitrofanova was back, then she saw everything!"
"- Enough moaning, let's go."
- Here will be parents and guests.
- Can they sit on the grass?
It's better in the shade.
- I'll think about it.
- Where do I put this?
- Not now.
- Crocodile.
- I can see that.
- Here we'll hold the games.
- Like sack racing?
- That's right.
From that spittoon to this lamp post.
You're in charge.
- How about we come up with something new?
"It's always the same: throwing balls, tossing rings, bobbing for apples..."
"Something new, you know."
I'm sure we can manage!
- I'll think about it.
- Where do I put this?
- Not now!
"- All right, so."
Here we throw the balls.
Here we toss the rings.
And here... we bob for apples.

Come here.
Go catch her.
Go!
Where are you running?
Father.
"Father, are you taking your medicine on time?"
Yes dear.
- How is your chest pain now?
I have only one pain.
My young daughter drives the rickshaw.
And I live off her.
- Why do you think like that?
"Nowadays, girls drive a car, even fly a plane."
I only drive the rickshaw.
"When I was born, hadn't you told mom it's not a girl, but a boy?"
Right?
Sister!
- My Munni is back!
"Leave that, come to your sister."
She is the daughter of the house.
"You are back from school, child?"
Yes.
"But tell me, why did you quit school?"
"When poverty pulled my leg, . . . helplessness took away books from my hand."
"I could not become a doctor, but I'll make you a very big doctor."
"When I become a doctor, I'll first cure father."
"Yes, father will recover."
"Then you, me and father will go on a holiday."
We'll go to a place where there are mountains covered with snow.
We'll climb those.
- But how will I climb a mountain?
"O dear, keep that pan aside."
I will burn myself into ashes.
Will you keep it aside if I tell you?
Have you not told me to do so?
- Let us go out.
It seems son-in-law is going to do something.
Let us not disturb him.
Come on.

It is burning!

"Bhadra, Ranga Rao came to see you."
Let him in.
"- Hey you, come here."
"Sir, Bhadram sir!"
You are my God.
Please save my daughter and me.
She is my only daughter and I brought her up as a doll.
Even my master is also looking her as a doll.. ..but he wants to see her in his home.
He is ready to give 10 lakhs if you accept this marriage.
When crores are coming who needs lakhs.
"I will first use him to finish Venkat, then think this matter."
"My God, 10 lakhs?"
Where are they?
"Here, take them."
"Sir, God has given me an extra tooth but not extra intelligence."
I would have realized your heart if He gave me that.
But I am unfortunate.
This marriage will not happen.
Why is that?
"Every idiot wants to marry my daughter.. ..Sir, I am not talking about him."
"He is pure gold, I am talking about that fellow.. ..who trapped my daughter in the name of love."
Who are you?
Why are you standing there and blocking the entrance?
Please come in sir.
Please have this seat sir.
"This is the house of a poor man, built with a lot of effort."
"Come here, he is Badri, a very famous man."
He has a very big heart.
He is the king of Telangana.

He visited only ours.
"She is Shailaja, my daughter."
"Will you get some coffee, my dear?"
She is learning dance.
He brought that rowdy with him.
One scoundrel joined another.
You leave quickly.
What about the coffee?
I will take care of all that.
You leave now.
Otherwise you may not meet that guy.
Why did the young girl become an old woman?
"Sir, coffee!"
Please take it.
She is my mother in law.
But she is more than my mother.
Then why do you make her serve the coffee?
You should have asked your child to do it.
She went to the temple for her prayer.
She should have gone after an hour.
After an hour the priests will close the temple and leave.
My child has a lot of devotion for God.
There is a temple on the side and that side too.
"You go on, call him."
Take this over.

- Are you asleep?- No.
"Okay, good."
"Then, his mom said to him, ""My son..."""
"""Lying is a very bad thing,"" she said."
"""Children shouldn't lie."""
"""No matter what, they shouldn't lie,"" she said."
"""They shouldn't lie, even if their mothers wants them to,"" she said."
"You are lying to me as well, now."
I know what you said isn't written here.
"- It is written here son.- The Baby Rabbit's story is different, I know it."
"Oh, this is the other *baby rabbit*'s story though."
Which is much better if you ask me.I think it is very good.
Children shouldn't lie.
They should never lie.
You don't lie to me either.Okay son?
Okay then.
Let us sleep now.I'm sleepy.

"They were beautiful, son.Very beautiful."

Good night.
I dont think so.
It is raining since this is the rainy season.
I remember from the rain.
I will show you a beautiful place.
Come
Where to?
To the temple of thousand pillars.
It will be wonderful experience to see it when it is raining.
With two temples on either side of nandi .. ..and a rainbow starting from one temple ends on the other.
You have to see it definitely.
Really?
Will it be so nice?
You should see yourself to believe.
Come on let us go.
- Now?
It can be seen only when it is raining.
Believe me.
Please come once.
It stopped to rain.
Bye.
Where are you going?
Should I tell you?
At least tell me when will we meet again.
Let us see when it again rains.
What is that?
Didnt you tell that the rain is uniting us?
If we meet when it again rains.. ..I will also believe that there is something between us.
Bye.
You will meet again when it rains?
I dont understand a bit.
Do you at least know his name?
"What is there in the name, Grandmother?"
My Goodness!- I heard that uncle Hasan is afraid of Turunc Nadir.
I made Giray tell him as if Kenan said that he has to take his complaint back or...
Turunc Nadir will get to know about it..
You really don't know?
Did you wake up?
Come.
I didn't know you were home.
"We work at night girl, I wake up only now."
"While you sleep, probably nothing will be left to the bazaar."
I am waiting for you many hours already..
Wait I will wash my face and we will go.
I will leave as you will go to bazaar.
"I am sorry.- No dear, that takes the cake!"
I will come again.
Goodbye!
Say hello to your mom!
-Yes of course!
It means I was deceived but this**** girl and I didn't know.
The account for this will be asked.
"Here you are,- Thank you!"
Have a nice day! &amp;gt; Good day!
"I'm alright, I'm good, sweetie, don't worry."
"Okay , we'll talk later."
"Okay, my dearest, kisses for you too."

- It is a hotel.
Do they serve chicken or mutton?
Only those are available here.
In that case let us go in.
Come on.
Where to?
Listen to me.
How long will it take?
"It will be ready with in 10 minutes, sir."
Do it quickly.
- Ok sir.
Bring one chicken curry and mutton fry for my master.
"Bring boiled eggs along with them, for my master."
Why dont you announce that I also eat fish and crabs?
You forgot to mention prawns.
Really?
You bring them.
I will kill you.
"- They said that, not me."
Get lost you idiot.
- Talk politely.
Get lost you idiot sir.
These parents will never change and.. ..those lover will never unite.
Did you really love him?
Then why did you doubt him?
I did not doubt him.
It was he who told a lie.
"Ok, he told a lie."
But why?
Because he wanted you and could not leave you.
Everyone does not get true love.
You are fortunate to get that.
What right do you have?
These trees are mine.
- Quiet.
"There's no need to get angry for just few branches, get that."
"""My tree, my groves."""
Even birds don't make their nests on these trees.
And by growing roses under the plum tree.. ..do you want to grow a new kind of plant?
You shouldn't be concerned with what I do with them.
This is my property.
And this bungalow that you've seized.. - What did you say?
That belongs to me as well.
Yes.
I will have you thrown out of this house.
I know Indira very well now.
I will get an emergency declared on you.
"That's going to be declared three months later, grandpa."
Grandpa?
Who are you?
"I have a wonderful idea to give them a fitting reply, father."
"Scoundrels, watch now."
Just watch.
What are you doing?
Now you'll know how my son is.
Oh.. no.
He and my dad.. so this is how he is.
You threw a balloon at my father.
"My delicate, innocent and.."
Stop praising me.
And give them a reply.
- Ok.
What was that?
Is that your fitting reply?
"Choi Chul Joo tried to harm me, but there was always you, and grandfather, and... ..."
Sir Moonlight Black Hat!
What?
There's this tall man who wears this black hat.
"When you struck Choi Chul Joo, didn't you meet him?"
The man who helped the women's parents stop the boat from leaving!
- That man rescued me!
- Did you meet him?
So you do know him!
Don't you know who he is?
"He said he couldn't reveal his identity, so I didn't see his face."
Did you see it?
Do you know who he is?
He hid his identity from me.
It is not up to me to reveal it.
But I still want to see his face.
"I'm really good-looking, aren't I?"
You shouldn't look at me too often.
You'll only spoil yourself for other men.
I wasn't looking at you.
So you know how to be shy too?
What was that?
Why do you carry such a dirty thing with you?
It's a pouch.
That thing?
It's embroidered too!
Where is that thieves' mountain retreat?
"Young Miss always blindfolds me when we go, so I don't know."
"But if he's the one that took her, she should be safe."
"She was taken by force, I'm worried."
"If she went voluntarily, then I'm more worried!"
Is there no way to find her without causing too much commotion?
I have bad news.
Suraj's plane hasn't returned as yet.
There's still no news about him.
- No!
Please don't worry.
The search is on.
His companions did not see his plane crash.
We believe that he is still alive.
- Then why hasn't he returned?
He must have fallen in the hands of the enemy.
We cannot be sure at this stage.
- No!
What is the matter?
Was it news about Suraj?
His plane is lost.
"What will happen now, daddy?"
Suraj's plane is lost.
"I hope, nothing has happened to him."
"No, don't say that."
Suraj is alive.
My blessings will save him from every peril.
"Don't cry, my child."
I believe that he will return soon.
He has told me that he will return and eat what I have cooked.
You took away my husband.
I didn't say a word.
You took away my father and I didn't say a word.
You were unjust to me at every stage.
I never complained.
But...
If anything happens to my son I will believe that you are not God.
That you are not the protector of the universe.
The deal is done!
Wow!
Nice deal!
I will make the remaining arrangement!
Now you all can leave!
Greetings!
- Greetings!
"Let""s leave! so shekhar has sent you both here?"
To hell with shekhar!
"Now he is not capable, kaka sir!"
He has started killing his men!
"His intentions have turned bad, kaka sir! so why should we help him?"
"Right! lt""s futile to give milk to the snake. - correct!"
Where is the gold?
"Gold is safe wherever it is, kaka sir!"
You help us and take your share!
Fine!
"But let""s form a plan."
You sail your ship s.s verona in the direction of.. ..West 20 East 32 and station it there.
We will reach there.
We have to deliver the goods at Lakhaidi island.
Good!
Good!
Done!
Done!
"This is betrayal! kaka sir, we might be smugglers!"
"But that doesn""t mean that we put our country at stake!"
We ruin our country!
"And sell our motherland! kaka sir, can we sell our motherland?"
They will even sell garden and air.
They will even sell garden and air.
lf they had their way they will sell God.
"We're gonna be late.- Be a good boy in there, okay?"
Are you really okay?
"You look very pale, my child.Come, take my arm."
"- Are you here, jerk?- Kerim what are you doing."
Collect yourself.
I will make you pay for everything you did.
"- Come on, Kerim."
What are you doing?- He can't stare at us from there.
"- Abi, it's okay."
"Not here.- Come on, walk inside Kerim."
- He lost it again.
"Take him inside.- Okay, leave it to me."
"- Fatmagül...- We're come, we're coming."
"It's your turn Fatmagül, okay?Don't let them scare you."
"Be brave, stand straight."
You will be victorious.We will be.
My knees are shaking.
My whole body feels stiff.
I've waited for this day for months.
I've waited patiently.
It's time for revenge.
It's time to stand against thosewho tried to take my life away.
Why are you looking at me with hatred?
Why?
Because I didn't yield to you?
Because I didn't loose against youand I didn't accept the life you forced upon me?
You expect me to hang my head in shame as I walk before you.
I'm not the one who should be ashamedand you know that well.
Hence the hate in your eyes.
You wanted to clean your dirty consciences by staining me.
Even giving up your honors for it.
"*""We won't hurt you."
Say something.
Please.
I shouldn't have kidnapped you.
"The car, the bridge, it was too far."
Thank you.
But you shouldn't have lied to me today.
"You can't go off and do things like that, Elena."
Not while Klaus is still alive.
I know.
I just...I wanted to give Bonnie a moment with her mother without everything else getting in the way.
Without me getting in the way.
I didn't plan on kissing him.
"You're better than him, Elena."
You're better than both of us.
Elena's on her way.
Jamie's safe.
"He's a little bruised, but he's safe."
Do you think the hybrid will come back?
You kept your end of the bargain.
Klaus usually keeps his.
You're willing to do all of this for him...
And he's not even your family.
"He is my family, Bonnie."
"I know that might be hard for you to hear, but he is."
But that doesn't mean that I don't care about you.
I want to help you.
You can't.
You have no magic and I don't trust you.
"When I put mikael down, my magic didn't just leave me."
It drifted away.
"The longer I stayed away from you, the weaker it got."
I think nature was punishing me for abandoning you.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No at last.
How old are you?
30.
Then you're not a little girl.
No.
Okay.
"So, you're a 30 year old girl, who's afraid of a guy like me."
"Well, I don't even know if -- well, I don't know if I'll be afraid of you."
You -- I get real defensive with you.
Now what can I do to you?
"You can't do anything, but I can sure feel dumb."
And I can feel stupid for not having the right answers.
Now what would it do to you to feel dumb and stupid?
I hate it when I'm stupid.
What would it do for you to be dumb and stupid?
"Let me put it like this, what would it do to me if you were to play dumb and stupid?"
It makes you all the smarter and all the higher above me and then
I really have to look up to you because you are so smart.
"Ah, yeah."
Butter me up.
"No, I think you can do that all by yourself."
"Ah, I think the other way around."
"If you play dumb and stupid, you force me to be more explicit."
"That's been said of me before, but I don't buy it."
I don't think --
Now what you are doing with your feet now?
Wiggling.
[giggles]
"Anyway, I don't want to focus too much on that."
You can play around with that if you like.
Minus this whole thing evaluated at 0.
So what's e to the minus 0?
"Well, e to the minus 0 is 1."
Right?
That's e to the 0.
"We have a minus 1, so it becomes plus 1 times-- now, sine of 0 is 0."
"Minus 1 over s squared, cosine of 0."
Let's see.
"Cosine of 0 is 1, so we have minus 1 over s squared, minus 1 over s squared, times 1."
So that is equal to minus 1 over s squared.
"And I think I made a mistake, because I shouldn't be having a negative number here."
So let's backtrack.
Maybe this isn't a negative number?
"Let's see, infinity, right?"
This whole thing is 0.
"When when you put 0 here, this becomes a minus 1."
Yeah.
So either this is a plus or this is a plus.
"Let's see where I made my mistake. e to the minus st-- oh, I see where my mistake is."
Right up here.
"Where I factored out a minus e to the minus st, right?"
Fair enough.
"So that makes this 1 over s, sine of at."
"But if I factor out a minus e to the minus st, this becomes a plus, right?"
"It was a minus here, but I'm factoring out of a minus e to the minus st."
So that's a plus.
This is a plus.
"Boy, I'm glad that was not too difficult to find."
So then this becomes a plus.
And then this becomes a plus.
They all look like superstitious rubes.
They've got no credibility.
Thomas will rip them to pieces.
"You'll be worse off than you are now, if that's possible."
You're gonna replace me on this case.
You've screwed it up beyond all repair.
But the archdiocese feels that replacing you now... ...would only draw more unnecessary attention to the trial.
"But just so we're clear, Bruner... ...if you put that priest on the stand again, I will fire you."
You've been crying.
- Dr. Cartwright is dead.
- What?
He was killed.
There was an accident.
I'm sorry.
I know he was your friend.
We've lost.
"Without his testimony, it's over."
No.
"No, no, no, it isn't over."
We're telling Emily's story.
That's what matters.
- It can't be worth all this.
"- Yes, it is worth it."
Just let me go back on the stand and tell the rest of the story.
- I can't do that.
- You must!
You must.
"Erin, you once said that you felt you were on the right path."
Don't stray from that path.
"Here, take this."
- What is this?
- Just read it.
The girl made this up because she was scared of you.
"She went away with Kerim, willingly."
And that's all there is to it.
This is a terrible ruse!
It's a disgusting frame set up by my rivals there.
Then do whatever necessary to clean up this mess.
- What's in the news?
It says Selim did it?
"- They're fabricated news, dear."
- Who's the girl?
- Will you calm down please?
Do whatever's needed to clean it up.
If my family's name gets involved in such a scandal... ...
"I will burn the bridges, just so you know."
"Meltem, calm down sweetie."
Let's first understand what it is.
Then do what needs to be done.
Don't waste time.
"I'll be on it right away, don't worry."
God...
My hands and legs are shaking.
God damn whoever is responsible for this slander.
- I'll be waiting for your call.
- I'll call you right away.
"We're toast now, Perihan."
We're toast.
God damn it!
"Girl, look..."
It's on the local news only.
It's most likely a slander.
That's what the man said.
For God's sake...
"That would work, as well."
Doctor?
How is Mustafa Bulut?
"He isn't very well, right now."
"But, it is still early."
- He will get better.
- How can he get better?
"Is the technology to make him well discovered in this world, yet?"
"For me, I think he has found the perfect place for himself!"
They should leave him alone.
"Really, it was because of you, Doctor!"
"Thanks, to you!"
"Really, thanks!"
You don't know what it is to live under those conditions.
We wanted him to go there for treatment.
"So, that he gets better and gets out."
We have no other agenda.
"Okay, my dear... drink this.."
Isn't it a hospital?
He is there to get well.
Your husband is going to get better and come home.
You can't carry on like this.
"But, Mom, what can I do?"
"How can I bear this, Mom?"
"Go to sleep, my daughter."
"Come, sleep."
Pray to God.. it will give you strength.
"Hey, Naciye... look for second.."
"Don't mess with me, Safiye..."
I will tear your hair out!
"You crazy idiot, aren't we from the same village?"
"I just called over to have you drink a soda, relax, tell me your trouble... come.."
OK you can stop.
Thank you.
OK for our next one we're going to dribble and we're going to switch hands every time we dribble the ball.
OK?
So you're going to dribble until I say stop.
"OK, try again."
"OK, that's good."
Thank you.
You're going to come around to the side and we're going to put our knees on the red pad.
You're going to keep your feet in the air like this.
OK?
And you're going to push up until I tell you to stop.
Try to keep your back nice and straight and we're going to push down and up.
Ready?
Begin.
OK keep that back nice and straight and try to bend your arms up and down.
There you go.
And stop.
OK.
For our last activity we're going to lay down on the carpet.
We're going to put our hands next to our side.
We're going to sit up and bring your hands up to your knees and back down.
Up and down.
OK?
So you're going to sit up until I tell you to stop.
Ready?
Begin.
Good and try to make sure you get your shoulders off the ground.
There you go.
And Stop.
OK Reagan that was our last activity.
Thank you so much for letting us work with you today!
"Really, you made me so happy by coming here."
I was so touched that day...
"I couldn't stop the car, you couldn't talk with Yaman..."
"Enough to know that he is fine, I will come from time to time to see him even if it's from distance."
It's okay even if I don't talk.
It's enough for me to know that he is happy.
What's up?
Fine! &amp;gt; It's been a while we have met.
Do we use to meet in the past?
What's happening to you?
Let me know if we are on outs.
"No... far from it, why should be on outs.. for being on outs... there has to be a communication... right?"
What? &amp;gt; All the best with your studies!
See you!
Rudeness...
"He has grown in the mud but ,my kid didn't become dirty."
Don't let him become dirty!
Keep it if you want.
Really?
- Take !. there are more in the photo album.
Do you love Yaman?
"Yes...I mean like a friend,i love him.."
I have a boyfriend.
We are together for a long time.
Do you love him then?
"In fact if you look, it's very stupid to think of something like sitting here... but Orkun was always in my life, from my childhood."
We grew up in the same aquarium.
"I don't know if it's really love, habit or we got used to each other..."
We get on well.
"I mean Orkun is very nice, cheerful, ..."
Funny.. -Yaman is funny too...
"Yes, Yaman Is very different of course..."
Last week.
"Look, I'm just trying to change the world, okay?"
I don't have time for a grudge match with every poser in a parka'.
Besides there's kids in that park so...
Here's one from dead-not-sleeping.
"Long time watcher, first time writing."
Blah blah blah blah.
"""You always say in your blog that you will show her the way,"" show her you're a true villain."
Who is her?
And does she even know that you're...
Laundry day...
See you there.
Under things... tumbelling.
Wanna say...
"""Love your hair"""
Here I go... mumbling.
With my freeze ray I will stop...
The world.
With my freeze ray I will find the time to find the words to...
Tell you how...
How you make... make me feel.
What's the phrase?
Like a fool.
Kinda sick.
Special needs.
Anyways... with my freeze ray I will stop...
The pain.
"It's not a death ray or an ice beam, that's so Johnny Snow."
I just think you need time to know that I'm the guy to make it real.
The feelings you don't dare to feel.
I'll bend the world to our will.
And we'll make time stand still.
"Over here, continue there, continue there."
"So how many one, two, three, four, five."
Nine.
That's what it looks like.
So obvious. . No.
Okay.
"Now notice, what a pain this is."
Just so I can give you more headaches.
"By the way, you only have to build it once."
"We're going to have the code right here, right now."
So it's only you have to build it.
"It's just, we'll have the code right here, right now."
I ask you guys to put ones with an occasional zero down.
And then going to put zeros with an occasional ones down.
And then you're going to put some ones on the corners.
Okay.
"So, kinda problematic, cuz these guys and these guys are painful I got to figure out how to do that vector."
Okay.
"So, we'll do that."
But for right now let's do some easy things.
"Let's put down these ones, these ones, these ones, and these ones."
Notice where they go.
"This starts at n plus 1N,"
Right?
And this is a little N by N block.
"Or, in my notes, I think, that means it's a M by M block."
"It's N by N, these are M by Ns, M by Ms,"
Okay? you know what?
"If you say you said M I'd say no, you didn't hear me right."
You wouldn't know for sure if I said m or n.
They're so close.
I could lie.
Whose car's out front?
That's mine.
I'm Bonnie.
Your daughter.
"Hello, Bonnie."
How do you know this is going to work?
It's a process.
It took decades to train myself to resist compulsion.
The brain's like a muscle.
"The more you use it, the more it can do."
"A sire bond, at its core, is about one thing..."
Gratitude.
"If you believe you owe Klaus your life, ask yourself why."
I was cursed.
"Every full moon, I had to change into a wolf."
It was torture.
Klaus took that away.
Freed you from your pain and you feel indebted to him.
"To break the sire bond, you've to make yourself turn."
"Own your pain, then you'll owe Klaus nothing and you'll be free."
But how can he turn?
It's not a full moon.
He doesn't need one.
"You're a hybrid now, right?"
"I mean, you can turn at will or not, am I right?"
"Yeah, but I don't know how to just...Start."
Now you're making excuses.
You don't understand!
"When I turn, I break every bone in my body."
You asked for my help.
This is the only way.
How badly do you want your freedom?
"I wrecked my familyfor nothing, absolutely nothing."
I don't have the face to say anything.
But what happened has happened.
I did it again.
Forgive me.
Forgive me and go.
As if you left me anywhere to go.
Who would accept me now?
Who would forgive me?
"If you spoil those men's game...Maybe, your husband will get soften."
Go girl...
I'll buy your plane ticket.I'll put some money in your pocket as well.
Go and testify.Be their doom !
"Offf, days and weeks have passed here."
But these minutes feel even longer.I'll loose my mind.
- What if we come back here.- Stop being a merchant of doom.
We'll end up here againif you keep attitude.
Stop it!
"- What's wrong, man?- Don't touch me!"
- He is just shaving you.- I don't want him to.
Fuck off then.
- I'm not dying to touch your face.- Ibrahim...
- If it wasn't for the orders I was given...- Just do your job.
Sit down.
Don't piss him off.
"- Sit down!- Come on, man."
We need a shave as well.
I feel dizzy.Must be because of high blood pressure.
"- Perihan, please get a grip on yourself.- Can we find some water?"
My mouth is also dry.
I told you not to come hereand go directly to the courthouse.
I will be the only one to see them anyway.
I wasn't embarrassed.
Now that's when you're mad you're not a phony.
I still resent that.
I'm not a phony when I'm nervous.
Again!
I want to get mad at you!
I...I...you know what -- [mocking]
I...I...I...
I want you on my level so I can pick on you just as much as you're picking on me.
"Okay, pick on me."
I have to wait until you say something that I can pick on.
What does this mean?
Can you develop this movement?
It's a...I can't find words.
I want to...
Develop this.
But since you've been dancing...
I want to start all over again with you.
"Okay, let's start over."
I know a corner I'd like to put you in.
"I'd like to ask you a question and because I have a feeling you don't like me right off the bat, and I want to know if you do."
Can you not play [indiscernible]
What would he say?
"He'd say that she's a phony, for one."
"So, you are a phony."
"You're a phony, and you're a flip little girl, and you're a show off..."
What would [indiscernible] have said to that?
"I know what I'd answer,"
"I'd say, ""I think you are too."""
"Well then, tell this to me."
Tell me what a phony I am.
[laughing]
I am sure of that.
I can tell that Kazım Bey wants to do something for her... ... we appreciate it but.
We don't want it.
I think you shouldn't make your decision now.
Think of it as your father's last wish.
No.
We thank you but.
I can't accept that either.
Because he's never been my father.
"I just named this big void in my life ""father""."
I will never forgive him because he didn't try to fill this void.
I'll never forgive him for trying to ease his conscience with a piece of paper.
But I will not wish him ill.
So he doesn't need to worry.
- I can understand your anger.
- No you can't.
"This is not anger, mom."
"It's not hatred, disappointment or anything."
"- I know, sweetheart."
"- I mean, I never had a father."
And there never will.
Please you close this subject not to be opened again.
The decision is yours.
I feel much lighter now.
I won't have to lie to anybody anymore.
I can say my father really died.
My dear child.
Did I wake you up?
"No, I gotta go anyway."
"Oh, why?"
I thought we'd have breakfast together.
"No, I'll go to work."
What's her damage?
No damage.
"Come on, Ric, it's a fact of life."
"A girl that hot, that smart...Damage."
"Well, you know, I'm looking for red flags."
"Her, uh, her ex called her a psycho case the other day."
"Yeah, but if it comes from her ex, it doesn't count."
I guess you're right.
It's yours.
I wonder what my exes would call me.
Nothing.
They're all dead.
Hmm.
"Well, her ex is the medical examiner, so he's dead-adjacent."
She dated the medical examiner?
Mm-hmm.
"Well, I don't think he's dead-adjacent."
I think he's just dead.
What?
Murdered.
Sheriff's trying to keep a lid on it because he was staked in the chest like a vampire.
"Well, Meredith didn't say anything about that."
"Well, red flag number two."
Who do you think killed him?
I don't know.
"But if I was a cop, your sexy doctor lady friend would definitely be a suspect."
"What are you doing here, Klaus?"
Enjoying our stalemate.
What do you want?
"Question is, what do you want?"
"My hybrids left town as you demanded, so please tell me what I need to do to get my family back."
"Well, ahem, see, Klaus..."
I will arrange a job for him.
Ask him will he do it?
Look here my child.
I care a lot for you.
All I want is you should never repent like your mother.. ..that you have married a guy who is useless like me.
Take this flower.
Girls should put it in the plait.
Boys must put it in the ear.
Give this flower to Venkat.
Take the plate.
By the way will our son-in-law agree?
How can I say that?
I know.
He will not accept.
Your father will arrange a job for me?
Will he make me a card distributor in that club?
"Venkat, be serious."
My dad want you to join.. ..as assistant manager in a cement factory.
I dont want that.
Why?
Because my father arranged it.
- Yes.
How will you feed me if you dont have any job?
Anyone can ask that to me but not you.
When you believed that rain has united us.. ..then why cant you believe that I can feed you.
How will you do that?
- I will rob a bank or I will steal.
I can do anything for my love.
Try to understand me.
You want to see me as an employee.
With in 24 hours I will come to your house as an employee.
You have tried to create a dispute between your daughter ..and me because I am unemployed.

There are not a lot of craters, but there are some cracks and lines. Because the surface is so young and smooth, scientists believe that there is a liquid ocean under the surface, and that it is kept warm by tidal heating. In other words, Jupiter's strong gravitational pull on Europa makes it warm."
The moon Europa was found by Simon Marius in December 1609. Galileo Galilei first saw the moon in January 1610 (he did not know Marius had found it). Simon Marius was the one who had the idea of the name 'Europa'.
"The moon Europa is named after a princess from Greek mythology who became the first queen of Crete. However, people usually called Europa 'Jupiter II' until the middle of the 20th century."

Four years later, in 999, the Holy Roman Emperor Otto III gave this district to his sister Adelheid, who was an abbess in Quedlinburg."
"In the center of this area, the ""provincia Gera"", a town with the same name was established. Another document, which is from the year 1237, said for the first time that there was a town called Gera. In this town, the abbesses of Quedlinburg had some officials which were called the ""Vögte"" of Gera. These officials were the ancestors of the counts and princes of Reuß, which reigned in Gera for many years, until the year 1918."
"In the early modern period, Gera was famous for making textiles. There were some fires in which a lot of the town was destroyed, for example in 1686 and in 1780. In 1806, Napoleon was in Gera before the Battle of Jena."
"In the 19th century, Gera became an important city of industry. Before that, Gera was a quite small town, but in the year 1900, it had already about 45,000 inhabitants."
"In 1920, Thuringia was founded as a state of the Weimar Republic. Gera was the biggest city of the state, because Erfurt was not yet a part of Thuringia. At the end of World War II, some parts of Gera were destroyed by bombs, for example the Osterstein Castle."
"After World War II, Gera was in the Soviet Occupation Zone and then in the German Democratic Republic (GDR). From 1952 to 1990, it was the capital of the Gera District (""Bezirk Gera"") of the GDR."
"Since the German Reunification in 1990, Gera belongs to the Free State of Thuringia in the Federal Republic of Germany."

Since the German Reunification, the number of inhabitants becomes smaller and smaller. Now there are fewer people who live in Gera than in Jena, so Gera is only the third-biggest city in Thuringia.

"Apatite is a group of phosphate minerals with high concentrations of OH−, F−, Cl− or ions, respectively, in the crystal."
Apatite is characteristic of biological systems. It is one of a few minerals produced and used by biological micro-environmental systems. It hardness defines 5 on the Mohs scale. Hydroxyapatite is the main component of tooth enamel and bone mineral.
"Much bone material is in a relatively rare form of apatite. In this form most of the OH groups are absent, and there are many carbonate and acid phosphate substitutions."
"Fluorapatite (or fluoroapatite) is more resistant to acid attack than is hydroxyapatite. In the mid-20th century it was discovered that communities whose water supply naturally contained fluorine had lower rates of dental caries. Fluoridated water allows exchange in the teeth of fluoride ions for hydroxyl groups in apatite. Similarly, toothpaste often includes a source of fluoride anions (e.g. sodium fluoride, sodium monofluorophosphate)."

"There were five German divisions. The Germans had prepared defenses, but they lacked officers."
"The Allied planning for their attack was detailed. British 5th Division and 1st Division were to attack along the coast. The U.S. 45th Infantry, 1st Armored and 3rd Infantry Divisions would attack the German 362nd and 715th Infantry Divisions."

The improvements James Watt had introduced made coal a cheap source of energy. As a consequence, Watt's steam engine was more popular, and its use was more widespread. So even though each steam engine used less coal, the demand for coal increased, as there were more steam engines."

Farn-Sasan
"Farn-Sasan was the last king in the Indo-Parthian Kingdom who ruled Sakastan from about 210 to 226. There are no books that talk about him. He is only known because of the coins he issued. He was killed in 226 by the ruler Ardashir I. Because of this, the Indo-Parthian rule ended."
Origin of name.
"Then name ""Sasan"" was popular with the Indo-Parthian people. The origin of the name is not entirely known. David Neil MacKenzie and V.A. Livshits says that the name comes from Old Iranian, translating to *""Sāsāna"" (""defeating enemy""). It is also the name of a Zoroastrian deity."
Biography.
"Farn-Sasan went into the Indo-Parthian throne sometime in 210. They don't know what king was before him. They think it may have been Pacores. Farn-Sasan is not mentioned in any books. He is only known because of his coins. These coins all say ""Farn-Sasan, son of Adur-Sasan, grandson of Tirdat, son of the grandson of Sanabares, the King of Kings."" Farn-Sasan tried to make himself notable by his rule by showing that he was related to his great-grandfather, Sanabares, a famous Indo-Parthian king. He calls the King of Kings Sanabares the King of Kings. Farn-Sasan also called himself the King of Kings. This happened a lot in Achaemenid and Parthian rulers."
Adur-Sasan and Tirdat were never a ruler. This means that Farn-Sasan was probably from a cadet branch in the dynasty.
"On the front side of the coins, he is seen with a cap. On the other side, a fire altar is shown. The altar has writing around it. Farn-Sasan is the only king that is known to have a fire altar on coins that is also from Sakastan. Around the same time, Ardashir I () made coins with a fire-altar that looked like Farn-Sasan's coins. Historians are not sure if Farn-Sasan copied the fire altar or if Ardashir I copied the fire altar off of Farn-Sasan."
"Farn-Sasan and Sasanian Ardashir I share a similar name. Because of this and the fact that both of their coin has a fire altar, historians think Sasanians and Indo-Parthians may have had common ancestry. Historians say that Farn-Sasan and Sasanian Ardashir I were rivals. Both wanted to be the King of Kings. The Iranologist Khodadad Rezakhani argues that Farn-Sasan was a superior of Ardashir I. He said that Ardashir I was only able to say that he was the King of Kings after he defeated Farn-Sasan in 226 and ended Indo-Parthian rule."

Temperament.
"Even though Affenpinschers were bred to hunt mice, they do not like to chase other animals, so they can happily live with other pets. They are playful but very stubborn. These dogs can be difficult to train, because they do not like to listen to instructions and often become bored. Affenpinschers are somewhat territorial (protective) when it comes to their toys and food, so they are not recommended for homes with very small children."
"This dog is mostly quiet, and does not bark much. It can become very excited if attacked, and shows no fear. toward any aggressor."
Health.
"A small study showed that these dogs live an average of 11.4 years, which is not very long for a small dog (small dogs usually live 14–15 years). One of their most common health problems is bladder disease, which happens most often when the dogs are older (8 years and up.) Their short faces can make it difficult for them to breathe and exercise in hot weather. Like many kinds of dogs, Affenpinschers often get a disease called hip dysplasia which makes it difficult for them to run or walk."
Extinct variant.
"The Seidenpinscher (Silky coated Pinscher), was bred from the Affenpinscher and the Maltese (dog) around 1800."

Black-legged dart frog

Appearance.
"The adult male frog is 32.1-39.5 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 35.7-42.7 mm. It has large disks on its toes for climbing. Young frogs have stripes on their sides. In some groups of this frog, the stripes go away when the frog is an adult. In other places, the adult frogs keep their stripes."
Poison.
Human beings who live where the frog lives have used the frog to poison arrows. The human can touch the arrow to the frog's back without killing it. Or the human can kill and heat the frog's body.
The poison in the frog's skin is a chemical called batrachotoxin. The frog gets the poison from the ants and other insects that it eats. So frogs kept as pets do not have poison.
Threats.
There are fewer of these frogs than there were. Scientisis think this could be because human beings change the places where the frog lives. Humans turn the forests into forms and take the trees for lumber. Human beings also catch these frogs to sell as pets.

gee our old LaSalle ran great
Those were the days
And you knew who you were then
girls were girls and men were men
Mister we could use a man like Herbert Hoover again
People seemed to be content
fifty dollars paid the rent
freaks were in a circus tent
Those were the days
Take a little Sunday spin
go to watch the Dodgers win
Have yourself a dandy day
that cost you under a fin

History.
"As well, the Mediterranean's sea lanes were opened to the Allies, and Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was briefly removed from power."
Background.
Allies.
"The plan for Operation ""Husky"" called for the sea attack of the island by two armies. One would land on the South Eastern coast. Another would land on the central Southern Coast. The attack would be helped by naval gunfire and bombing. The commander was the American General Dwight D. Eisenhower."
"The Allied land forces were from the American, British and Canadian armies. They were put into two groups. The Eastern Task Force was led by General Bernard Montgomery. The Western Task Force was commanded by Lieutenant General George S. Patton. In addition to the sea landings, airborne troops were to be flown in. They would capture bridges and high ground."
The Allied naval forces were put into two groups to transport the invading armies.
"The island was defended by the two corps of Italian 6th Army under General Alfredo Guzzoni. In early July the total Axis force in Sicily was about 200,000 Italian and 32,000 German troops, and 30,000 ""Luftwaffe"" ground staff. By late July there were 70,000 German troops."
Planning.
The attack plan was made on 17 May.
"At the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, political leaders and the military leaders of the US and Britain met to discuss future plans. The British wanted an invasion of Sicily. General Eisenhower was made Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces."
Preparatory operations.
"Once the Axis forces had been defeated in Tunisia, the Allied bombers attacked the airfields of Sardinia, Sicily and southern Italy. They also bombed industrial targets in southern Italy and the ports of Naples, Messina, Palermo and Cagliari."

This system of inheritance is called absolute primogeniture, as opposed to male-preference primogeniture. When someone who is in line to the throne has a child, that child comes after them and their older children, but before anyone else in the line of succession."

During the day, they stay still, cover their blue sides with their back legs, tuck their bright feet under their stomachs, and shut their red eyes. So they look almost completely green, and are well hidden amongst the leaves. The large red eyes are a defensive adaptation called deimatic behaviour. When a red-eyed tree frog detects a predator, it abruptly opens its eyes and stares at the predator. The sudden appearance of the red eyes may startle the predator, giving the frog a chance to flee."
They are active at night. They like to eat small insects.
"During mating, the female carries the male on her back for several hours during the process. The female chooses a leaf above a pond or large puddle on which to lay her clutch of eggs. The male puts out his sperm onto the eggs as they are released."
Tree frogs lay jelly-like eggs. The mothers will stay near them and help them fight any hungry animals that want to eat them. They become a tadpole in one or two weeks. They drop from the leaf and into the lake which is below the leaf.
"If predators are close enough to produce vibration, the embryos sense this. After a few seconds, they vigorously hatch out into tadpoles and spread out to escape."

"In publishing for example, a template is a layout made by someone else to give an idea what to write in different parts of a book or story. A simple publishing template can have spaces for the words, for pictures, for the story title (name), and for the name of the publication."
"Humans or machines can use templates. Some computer programs that work with the Internet use a template to separate the way the program works from the way it shows the words and pictures. It can be a way to copy words and pictures. In computer programming, templates save time because the programmer does not need to write the same words over and over."

Background.
The Allied landings in Italy in September 1943 were followed by an advance north in two parts. An advance was made on each side of the mountain range in the middle of Italy.
"On the western side, U.S. Fifth Army moved from Naples. In the east General Sir Bernard Montgomery's British Eighth Army moved up the Adriatic coast."
The Fifth Army made slow progress because of difficult land and German defences. The Germans were protected in positions. The original plans that Rome would be captured by October 1943 did not occur.
"Although in the east the Ortona was captured, the advance stopped in December because of snow. Going to Rome from the east was not possible. Highway 6 ran through the Liri valley. The south entrance to this valley was Cassino. It was an important part of Gustav Line, the strongest defensive positions in the Winter Line."
"Because the old Benedictine Abbey was important to history, German units did not put defensive positions in the Abbey."
Some Allied aircraft saw German troops in the Abbey. The Abbey looked over the valley. This made it a good place for German artillery observers. This made Allied commanders want to bomb the Abbey.
First battle.
Plans and preparation.
"The plan of U.S. Fifth Army commander General Clark was for British X Corps to attack on January 17, 1944. The British 46th Infantry Division was to attack on January 19. This would support the main attack by U.S. II Corps on their right."
The main central attack by U.S. II Corps would start on January 20. The 36th (Texas) U.S. Infantry Division would cross a river five miles from Cassino. The French Expeditionary Corps would move towards Monte Cairo.
"Fifth Army had only reached the Gustav line on January 15, having taken six weeks and getting 16,000 casualties."
Attack.
"The first attack was made on January 17. Near the coast, British X Corps crossed the Garigliano. General von Senger, commander of German XIV Panzer Corps did not think he could stop the attack. He asked for more troops. The 29th and 90th Panzer Grenadier Divisions were sent to him. X Corps had 4,000 casualties during the first battle."
"The central attack by U.S. started on January 20. They were attacked by General Eberhard Rodt's 15th Panzer Grenadier Division. The attack was a failure, with 36th Division losing 2,100 men killed, wounded and missing in 48 hours."
The next attack was on January 24. The U.S. II Corps attacked across the
Rapido valley north of Cassino. The 34th Division pushed back General Franek's 44th Infantry Division.
"On the right, the Moroccan-French troops made good initial progress against the Germans. The two Moroccan-French divisions had 2,500 casualties in their battles around Monte Belvedere."
"The U.S. 34th Division had to fight southward. By early February, American infantry had captured point less than a mile from the abbey. By February 7 a battalion had reached a hill below the Abbey. Attempts to capture Monte Cassino were stopped by machine gun fire from the slopes."
Afterwards.
"On February 11, after a 3-day attack on Monastery Hill and Cassino town, the Americans pulled back. U.S. II Corps was tired after two and a half weeks of fighting. They lost 80% in the Infantry battalions, about 2,200 casualties."
Second battle.
"This was called Operation Avenger. With U.S. VI Corps under threat at Anzio, Freyberg asked to help at Cassini. Freyberg thought there was only a 50% chance of success for the attack."
Destruction of the abbey.
"Allied officers started to think the Germans were using the abbey of Monte Cassino as an artillery observation point. The Allies thought of bombing with ""blockbuster"" bombs."
"The bombing in the morning of February 15, 1944 involved 142 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses heavy bombers followed by 47 North American B-25 Mitchell and 40 Martin B-26 Marauder medium bombers. They dropped 1,150 tons of bombs on the abbey. This turned it into rubble. II Corps artillery shelled the mountain. The German positions above and behind the monastery were untouched."
After the bombing.
Pope Pius XII said nothing after the bombing. Cardinal Secretary of State called the bombing “stupidity.”
It is now known that the Germans had agreed not to use the Abbey for military purposes.

Goalkeeper
"A goalkeeper is someone who protects a team's goal. There are goalkeepers in sports like football (soccer) and ice hockey, for example. The goalkeeper's mission is to prevent the opposing team from scoring a goal. Goalkeepers normally wear more protective gear than other players on the team but this is not always true."
Football.
"A goalkeeper's kit (or ""uniform"") consists of shin guards and gloves to protect his hands from the impact of the ball when he catches it."
"Historically, however, until the 1960s goalkeepers would wear no hand protection."
"Until the early 20th century, the goalkeeper would often wear the same coloured strip as his teammates, with the only different item of clothing being his cap. However, in 1909, the Scottish Football Association took steps to ensure the goalkeeper would wear a different colour from the outfield players. This was to show his different role, as the only player allowed to handle the ball."
Ice hockey.
"The goalkeeper in ice hockey (a ""Goalie"") uses thicker padding than the other players on the team. This is to prevent damage caused by being hit by the puck. The hockey stick of the goalie is much wider than the stick of other players. The bottom edge is also longer and flatter. The goalie has a very large leather glove on one hand. This glove has a large area to help catch the puck. Goalies normally wear masks that give protection to the entire face and head as well as the neck."
Field hockey.
"In field hockey, the goalkeeper stands in the goal net, and stops the other team scoring. Goalkeepers need a lot of kit to protect them from the hockey balls that are hit at them. here is a list:"
Goalkeepers are the only position in hockey allowed to kick the ball. If another player kicked the ball it would be a foul.

Alluvial gold was found in both Adelong Creek and Golden Gully in the same year. Adelong quickly became an important goldfield. Adelong Post Office opened on 1 January 1859.
"By 1859 a number of gold reefs were being mined, including the Old Reef and the Great Victoria Mine. Between 1859 and 1876, 3,798 kilograms of gold was mined. During the gold rush the population grew to more than 30,000 people. Over 25 tonnes of gold was mined from 1857 to the close of the mines in 1914. The National Trust of Australia has listed the main street of Adelong and a number of buildings as being important historical places."
A number of narrow tramway tracks were built in the mine area. Adelong is one of the only two gold mining areas in New South Wales known to have used a steam locomotive on its tramways.
"During the gold rush many Chinese people worked in the mines. Many died and were buried in a special part of the Adelong cemetery. The Chinese part of the cemetery was destroyed in the early 1900s.

Yayoi people.
"The Yayoi people (弥生人 ""Yayoi jin"") were ancient people that migrated to the Japanese archipelago from southeastern China during the Yayoi period (300 BCE–300 CE). Modern Japanese people are direct descedants of the Yayoi and have about 97% Yayoi DNA."
"The Yayoi and the modern Japanese people are closely related to other East Asian (or Mongoloid) people, such as Chinese or Vietnamese people. They belonged to the haplogroup O and spoke the proto-Japonic languages. Most scientists and linguists suggest that they originated somewhere in southeastern China and migrated from their into Japan."

William Shakespeare
"William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616) was an English playwright, poet, and actor. He wrote 39 plays (with about half of them considered comedies) and two long poems in his lifetime. He lived in Stratford-upon-Avon, in Warwickshire, England. His plays are still performed today. He is often quoted in modern writing."
"Shakespeare wrote his works between about 1590 and 1613. His plays are among the best known in English literature and are studied in schools around the world. Along with writing, Shakespeare also acted in The Chamberlain's Men acting company, starting in 1594."
"Shakespeare wrote plays of different kinds, or genres. There are histories, tragedies and comedies. Shakespeare was the first person ever to write a tragicomedy. (A tragicomedy is a play that mixes comedy and tragedy, with a happy ending.)"
"Shakespeare's plays are written in poetic language. Many of the plays are set in strange, distant places and times. The stories are often exciting, very funny (in the comedies), or very sad (in the tragedies). These stories make people want to know what will happen to the characters. The plays talk about things that are still important today, like love, sadness, hope, pride, hatred, jealousy, and foolishness."
"Shakespeare added new words and phrases to the English language. He created over 1,700 English words. He also made some words more popular."
Life.
"Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon. His date of birth is believed to be 23 April, though the exact date is unknown. He was the third of eight children. Shakespeare was probably educated at the King's New School in Stratford. Latin was popular in grammar schools during the Elizabethan era, so Shakespeare learned Latin very intensively."
"When Shakespeare was 18, he married Anne Hathaway, a 26-year-old woman. Their wedding was rushed because Anne was already pregnant. They had three children: Susanna (who married John Hall); Hamnet (who died at the age of 11 from unknown causes); and Judith (who married Thomas Quiney). By 1592, Shakespeare had become an actor and was becoming well known as a writer of plays."
"Miller formed a large marching band. He tried to modernize military music. Some officers didn't like it, but he continued because other leaders supported him. For example, he combined blues and jazz with the traditional military march. He formed the Army Air Force Band, with 50 members. In the summer of 1944, he took it to England, where he gave 800 performances and recorded a series of records. The music was used in American Forces Network radio broadcasting for entertainment and counter-propaganda against fascism. Miller also talked on the radio. One time, he said:"
"""America means freedom and there's no expression of freedom quite so sincere as music."""
Disappearance.
"On December 15, 1944, Miller was to fly from the United Kingdom to Paris, France, to play for the soldiers there. His plane departed from Clapham and disappeared while flying over the English Channel. There were two other people on the plane: Lt. Col. Norman Baessell and pilot John Morgan."
"There have been many theories about what happened to the plane. According to a 2014 article in the ""Chicago Tribune"", Miller's plane crashed because it had a faulty carburetor."
"In February 1945, Miller's wife, Helen accepted the Bronze Star Medal for him."
Legacy.
Civilian band legacy.
"When Glenn Miller was alive, various bandleaders like Bob Chester imitated his style. In 1942, Miller gave singer Mel Tormé advice about songwriting."
"By the early 1950s, more bands started to copy Miller's style."
"The Miller estate authorized an official Glenn Miller ""ghost band"" in 1946. This band was led by Tex Beneke, former tenor saxophonist and a singer for the civilian band. It was similar to the Army Air Force Band because it had a large string section. At first called the ""Glenn Miller Orchestra Under the Direction of Tex Beneke"", it later became ""The Tex Beneke Orchestra""."
"A film about Miller's life, ""The Glenn Miller Story"", was released in 1953. Because of this, the Miller estate asked Ray McKinley to lead a new ghost band in 1956. This band still tours the United States."
Army Air Force band legacy.
"After Miller's disappearance, his Army Air Force band was decommissioned and sent back to the United States. Another band, called ""the 314"", took its place."
Compositions.
"Miller composed at least fourteen songs, both by himself or with other people. He added lyrics to another song. These and other songs were recorded by Miller's civilian bands and his Army Air Force band."
Grammy Hall of Fame.
"Glenn Miller had three recordings that were put into the Grammy Hall of Fame after he died. This award is for recordings that are at least 25 years old and that have ""qualitative or historical significance."""

The Ghan
"The Ghan is a passenger train between Adelaide, Alice Springs, and Darwin on the Adelaide–Darwin railway in Australia. The train is operated by Great Southern Rail. It takes 54 hours to travel the with a four-hour stop in Alice Springs."
The name.
"The train's name is a short version of its nickname ""The Afghan Express"". This nickname is said to have been first used in 1923 by one the train crew. The train's name honours Afghan camel drivers who arrived in Australia in the late 19th century to help find a way to reach the country's unexplored interior."
"Another view is that the name was an insult. In 1891, the railway from Quorn reached Oodnadatta. This was home to about 150 cameleers, known as 'Afghans'. 'The Ghan Express' name was used by train crews in the 1890s as a joke because, when an expensive sleeping car was put on from Quorn to Oodnadatta, 'on the first return journey the only passenger was an Afghan'. As early as 1924, it was known as 'The Afghan Express' because it was so unreliable, often days, or weeks late. By 1951, when steam engines were replaced by diesel-electric locomotives, the insult of the names, like the cameleers, had faded away. Modern marketing has turned the name into a term of pride in its heritage."

Free State (province)
"The Free State (Afrikaans: Vrystaat, Sotho: Foreistata; before 1995, the Orange Free State) is a province of South Africa. Its capital is Bloemfontein, which is also South Africa's judicial capital, because the Supreme Court is there. The current borders of the province date from 1994 when the Bantustans were dissolved and were merged into the provinces of South Africa. It is also the only one of the older provinces of South Africa not to undergo border changes, not counting the incorporation of the Bantustans."
Orange Free State
"The Orange Free State () was a country in southern Africa. It was ruled by the Afrikaners. It was defeated by the British Empire and its colonies, the British Cape Colony and the Natal Colony, in the Second Boer War. It became the Orange River Colony and later joined with other colonies to make the Union of South Africa."
Bir Tawil
"Bir Tawil or Bi'r Tawīl (بيرطويل in Arabic; Bi'r or بير, meaning water well), is a small, , area. It is along the border between Egypt and Sudan. It is claimed by neither country right now. It is sometimes given the name the Bir Tawil Triangle, because even though it's not an exact triangle, it's made out of two triangles that share a border. The longer side is in the north of the area. It runs along the 22° north circle of latitude."
"The administrative boundary of Sudan and Egypt was made in 1902. Their political boundary was set in 1899. It was set as the 22° north circle of latitude. This area lies south of the 22° parallel. East-to-west, the area is between long in the south. It is long in the north. It is between and wide north-to-south. It is also in size."
"The Bir Tawil area came under Egyptian administration in 1902. This was because it was grazing land of the Ababda tribe based near Aswan, Egypt. At the same time, the Hala'ib Triangle north of latitude 22° north, and northeast of the area, came under Sudanese administration. This was because the tribes of this area were based in Sudan. The two ""triangles"" border at one point, a quadripoint."
History.
"In 1899, the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement for Sudan set the border between the territories at the 22nd parallel. At that time, the United Kingdom ruled the area. In 1902 the UK drew a separate ""administrative boundary"". Using this boundary, a triangle of land north of the parallel was placed under Sudanese administration. It was because its inhabitants were closer to Khartoum than Cairo, both geographically and culturally. The area was ruled by the British Governor in Khartoum."
"Egypt claims the original border from 1899, the 22° north circle of latitude. This would place the Hala'ib Triangle within Egypt and the Bir Tawil area within Sudan. Sudan claims the administrative border of 1902. This would put Hala'ib within Sudan, and Bir Tawil within Egypt. As a result, both states claim the Hala'ib Triangle. Neither state claims the much less valuable Bir Tawil area, which is only a tenth the size and is landlocked. There is no basis in international law for Sudan or Egypt to claim both territories. It would also be difficult for any other state to claim the area. This is because only Sudan or Egypt border the land. As a result, Bir Tawil is one of the few land areas of the world which is not claimed by any state. The offical currency is the but this is no longer circulated."

"When the second floor was built in 1178, the tower started to lean. This was because it had a small three-meter foundation in soft soil. The design of this tower was bad from the beginning. Construction was stopped for almost 100 years because the people of Pisa were often at war with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence."
There is an old story that Galileo Galilei used the Tower for a physics experiment.

Lachesis (genus)
"Lachesis, also known as the ""bushmasters"", is a genus of venomous Pit vipers found in forests of Central and South America. The name ""Lachesis"" is also the name of one of the Three Fates in Greek mythology. There are currently three species found."
Description.
"Adult bushmasters can grow up to the length of 2 meters (6.5 ft) to 2.5 meters (8.25 ft), but there have been some which have grown up to the length of 3 meters (10 ft). The largest one ever found was 3.65 meters (12 ft) long, making the bushmasters the longest venomous snakes in the Western Hemisphere and the longest vipers in the world. They are not the heaviest vipers in the world, but adults usually weigh up to 3 to 5 kg (6.6 to 11 Ib)."
Where they live.
Bushmasters are found in forest areas of Central and South America. They are also found on the island Trinidad
Reproduction.
"Bushmasters are oviparous: they lay eggs. This makes bushmasters different to other pit vipers found in the New World, because other pit vipers are viviparous, they give live birth instead of laying eggs. A female can lay around a dozen eggs at a time. The female stays with her eggs until they have hatched and may attack any predator that comes near the nest."
Venom.
"The bushmasters are one of the largest and dangerous snakes in South America, and can inject a large amount of venom into their enemies. Even young bushmaster's bites are harmful, but bushmasters are nocturnal (they are active at night), so not a lot of people have been bitten by them."

ICS Bégué
ICS Bégué is a French private business school in Paris. It was created in 1957 and is part of IONIS Education Group.
It is recognized by the French State.
Enol
An enol is an alkene that has an OH group attached to one end of the double bond. It is called an enolate if the proton on the oxygen atom is taken away.
"Enols are tautomers of ketones or aldehydes. Tautomers are molecules which are different only in the position of an hydrogen atom. Enols can be made very easily from ketones or aldehydes using a base. They are quite unstable, because the C=O bond is stronger than the C=C bond. However, they can do many interesting reactions. The best example is the aldol reaction."
"Enols of ketones can be made on two different sides. It is important to be able to choose which side to react. The side with less substituents is the easiest one to react: it can be made at low temperature with a bulky base. This is called the kinetic enolate. The other side, with more substituents, is more difficult to react. Higher temperatures are needed. This is called the thermodynamic enolate."
Steric effects
"Steric effects are the effects seen in molecules that come from the fact that atoms occupy space. When atoms are put close to each other, this costs energy. The electrons near the atoms want to stay away from each other. This can change the way molecules want to react. It can also change the shape (or conformation) of the molecule. The amount of space that a group of atoms takes is called the ""steric bulk""."
"An example of steric effects is steric hindrance. This is when a large group in a molecule makes reactions not work. For example, an SN2 reaction does not happen on carbon atoms that have three substituents. Steric hindrance however can also be a positive thing. Sometimes, chemists would like a reaction to happen in one place rather than another one. A bulky group can block a position. It can also change the shape such that only one diastereomer from a reaction is made."
"Steric effects are usually smaller than electronic effects. These affect the molecule's shape and reactivity as well, but they come from the way electrons are placed in bonds."
Motherland Party (Azerbaijan)
"The Motherland Party () is a nationalist and conservative political party in Azerbaijan. It was founded in 1990. Its members are mainly Azerbaijanis who come from Armenia. The party's leader Fazail Agamali is a former deputy minister for social protection. The party's aim is to create a ""free, powerful, democratic and entire Azerbaijan""."
"At the 2010 parliamentary elections, it won 2 out of 125 seats."
"On March 5, 2014, the Lightning traded St. Louis to the New York Rangers for New York captain Ryan Callahan, a 2015 first-round draft pick, and a conditional 2014 second-round pick."
"St. Louis is married to his wife Heather Coragol and they have three sons, Ryan, Lucas and Mason."
Campden tablets
"Campden tablets are used by people making their own beer, wine, or cider. The tablets kill yeast, making better yeast to be added later for better drinks. 5 of them in 1 pint of water makes a cleaning liquid that can be used to clean the equipment. They are made from sulfur. They were invented in Gloucestershire in the 1920s, but Boots Co. made them better. They can also be used to get rid of chlorine in tap water, making it safer to drink."
Meguro
"is one of the 23 special wards of Tokyo, Japan."
"The municipality calls itself ""Meguro City"" in English."
"As of December 31, 2007, the ward has an estimated population of 259,968 and a density of 17,685 persons per km². The total area is 14.70 km²."
"The ward was founded on March 15, 1947."
History.
"The area now known as Meguro was originally two towns. One was called Meguro, and the other was called Hibusuma. Both used to be parts of the Ebara District of Musashi Province. The two were combined to create Meguro ward for Tokyo City in 1932. The ward area has not changed since then."
Population.
"The number of people living in Meguro has not changed over the last forty years. The high was almost 300,000 people in 1970, and the low was under 250,000 in 1995. See the census information below."
Geography.
"There are four other special wards next to Meguro. They are Shibuya (to the northeast), Setagaya (to the west), Ōta (to the south) and Shinagawa (to the southeast)."
Foreign embassies and consulates.
There are many embassies from African nations in the ward.
Wilhelm scream
"The Wilhelm scream is a movie and television sound effect first used in 1951 for the movie ""Distant Drums"". The effect became popular again (its use often becoming an in-joke) after it was used in ""Star Wars"" and many other movies as well as television shows and video games. The scream is often used when someone is shot, falls from a great height, or is thrown from an explosion."
"The sound is named for Private Wilhelm, a character in ""The Charge at Feather River"", a 1953 western in which the character is shot with an arrow. This was believed to be the third movie to use the sound effect. It was the first use of the sound from the Warner Brothers sound library."
History.
"The sound effect comes from a series of sound effects made for the 1951 movie ""Distant Drums"". In a scene from the movie, soldiers are walking through a swamp in the Everglades. One of them is bitten and dragged underwater by an alligator. The scream for that scene was recorded later in one take. The sound was labeled as ""man getting bit by an alligator, and he screams."""
Growing popular.
"The Wilhelm scream began to become popular when Benjamin Burtt Jr. found the original recording (which he found labeled as ""Man being eaten by alligator"") and put it into a scene in """". Burtt is credited with naming the scream after Private Wilhelm (after a soldier in ""The Charge at Feather River"" who was shot by an arrow and screamed). Over the next decade, Burtt began using the effect in other films he worked on. This included most projects with George Lucas or Steven Spielberg. It is used in all of the Indiana Jones movies. Other sound designers picked up on the effect, and use of the sound in movies became a tradition in the community of sound designers."
"Research by Burtt shows that actor and singer Sheb Wooley, best known for his song ""Flying Purple People Eater"" in 1958, is likely to have been the voice actor who first performed the scream. This has been supported by an interview in 2005 with Linda Dotson, Wooley's widow. Burtt discovered records at Warner Brothers from the editor of ""Distant Drums"". These records include a short list of names of actors scheduled to record lines of dialogue for roles in the movie. Wooley played the uncredited role of Private Jessup in ""Distant Drums."" He was one of the few actors used for the recording of more vocal parts for the movie. Wooley performed more sound effects, including the screams for a man being bitten by an alligator. Dotson confirmed that it was Wooley's scream that had been in so many westerns, adding, ""He always used to joke about how he was so great about screaming and dying in films."""
Usage.
"The Wilhelm scream has become a cinematic sound cliché. By 2008 it had been used in many works, including over 216 movies, television shows and video games . Some directors, most notably George Lucas, include it in almost every one of their productions."
"In 2010, a Wilhelm Scream App was released on the Apple iPhone. As of 2011, it is still free to download."
"The second single by British artist James Blake was called ""The Wilhelm Scream"" and was released in 2011."
Gold rush
"A gold rush is when a lot of miners go to a mining place full of gold. Well-known examples are the California Gold Rush of 1848, the Australian gold rush which began in 1851, or the Fraser river gold rush in British Columbia, Canada in 1858."
California Gold Rush
"The California Gold Rush started when James Wilson Marshall was building a water powered sawmill for John Sutter in 1848. When he finished building the sawmill, he went to the river to fetch some water. He saw some shiny little flakes of gold in the river. He immediately went to tell John, and they tried to keep it a secret. But word soon got out, and the gold rush started."
"It was 1849 when the Gold Rush started. People who came to California for gold were called forty-niners because they came in the year 1849. Some of them became rich but most did not. Some people started selling things. Many of them became rich, famous, and politically powerful. Sometimes a woman could earn more than her mining husband."
Men like Levi Strauss also sold things. He invented and sold jeans made from strong denim. The California Gold Rush ended in 1855. Many gold miners went back home because gold was harder to find; others found other work.
Jeans
"Jeans are a type of pants made from heavy, strong cotton material (fabric) called denim. They were invented in the United States by Levi Strauss in 1872. In the late 1800s, jeans were worn by workers. Jeans are one of the most obvious symbols of American cultural influence in the world. They are worn in many countries around the world."
"In the 1950s, jeans became a popular fashion for teenagers and young adults. In the 1950s, jeans were part of rockabilly fashion for teenagers. Now, jeans are a very popular type of pants. They are usually worn as casual fashion clothing. Jeans are made in many styles and colors."
"The word ""jeans"" came from the French name of the city in Italy where a strong cotton fabric was made. The Italian city's name, Genoa, was spelled ""jene"" in Middle English and ""Gênes"" in the French language."
Sovereignty
Sovereignty is the right of a government to have complete control over its area. The idea that this right comes from doing good things for the people under control of the government is as old as Ancient Greece if not older.
"The exact meaning of Sovereignty has changed some in the past. The present meaning of Sovereignty is said to come from the Peace of Westphalia, an agreement between the rulers of Europe in 1648 which said:"
The Past.
Ancient Rome.
"Ancient Rome was first the Roman Republic, but then when Octavian made the Roman Empire the Emperor of Rome said that he was ""Sovereign"". The meaning of this was that he could make any law he wanted, and he did not have to do what the law said himself."
Middle Ages.
"In the time of the Middle Ages many kings and rulers had to do what other leaders said, such as the leader of the Catholic Church, the Pope. Because of this, the idea of ""Sovereignty"" was not much used."
Reformation.
"In the time of the Protestant Reformation, in the 16th century, governments were breaking away from religious leaders. Also many wars were fought between different rulers inside areas that are now sovereign countries. The English Civil War is one example of a war fought in this time between leaders inside one country."
"The Peace of Westphalia was made in 1648 and the idea of ""Sovereignty"" came back. Governments were now separate from outside leaders and only one government or ruler inside a country could make laws. The divine right of kings became more widespread."
The Enlightenment and Social Contract theory.
"The English thinker Thomas Hobbes wrote a book in 1651 that said rulers and governments are ""Sovereign"" because they are good for the safety of the people. The idea that people could change rulers if they were not safe was new with Hobbes."
Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote a book in 1763 that said the choice of the people is the only thing sovereignty comes from.
"Both Rousseau and Hobbes advanced a ""Social Contract"" in which people consent to a government's sovereignty just by living in the country and that people give up at least some of their liberty for security"
"In 1789 the French Revolution made an important country's government ruled by the choices of the people for the first time after the Middle Ages (some cities and small countries were democracies in the Middle Ages). There were many problems and France went back to the old way soon after, but would be ready for Democracy in 1870's. In England, many people got to vote after The Reform Act in 1832. The United States broke away from England in 1776-1783, but was not an important country at that time."

History.
The worship of goddess Panthoibi started right from the era of the Khaba dynasty ruling over the Kangla. This was written in the Panthoibi Khongul.
"The ""Panthoibi Naheiron"" text was written before Common Era. The fact was confirmed by the ""National Archives of India"". It contains Meitei hymns."
"In 1100 AD, the Loyumba Shinyen text mentions the Heishnam clan's service to goddess Panthoibi. The text addresses her as the most Meetei goddess."
"In the 17th century, Panthoibi appeared as a war goddess riding on a tiger. The Cheitharol Kumbaba's first record of the building of a temple of Panthoibi was in the year 1686. The same text's first record of the making of her statue was in the year 1699."
"In the 18th century, there was a downfall of the worship of Panthoibi with the rise of Vaishnavism in Manipur. Hindu King Garib Niwaj Pamheiba (1709-1748) pulled down her temples. He broke her statues. Her last recorded temple was built in 1700. After that, no temple was built in her honour until modern era came."
"From the 18th century onwards, Meitei goddess Panthoibi was equated as Hindu goddess Durga or her manifestation. The identity of Panthoibi was changed to that of Hindu goddess Durga. She was worshipped for five days in September – October."
"However, since 1960s, the worship of Panthoibi got increased. It started replacing the worship of Durga. In many regions, the place by Durga had been restored to Panthoibi."

Honorary degrees.
Cosby has been awarded at least 57 honorary degrees since 1985. Several of these honorary degrees have been rescinded due to allegations of sexual assault and/or immoral behavior:
Ham
Ham is pork that comes from a leg of a pig.
Ham can be dry-cured or wet-cured. Dry-cured ham is made by rubbing the meat with salt. Wet-cured ham is made with brine.
Types of dry-cured ham:
Ham is used in SPAM.
Spam (food)
"Spam is a canned meat food made by the Hormel Foods Corporation. It is made from pork shoulder meat and ham. Spam Lite, a newer kind of Spam, is made with pork and chicken."
"There have been many ideas about what the word ""Spam"" means. The Hormel Foods Corporation once said that it means ""Shoulder of Pork and Ham"", but in some dictionaries ""Spam"" means ""spiced ham""."
Members of staff at the SPAM museum say it stands for Specially Produced American Meat.
"In 2019, Spam began making advertisements containing the definition “Sizzle Pork And Mmmm”."
"Spam was used a lot in World War II, as there wasn't proper meat. Because of that, spam was used as a rationed item."
Mushroom
"A mushroom (also called a toadstool) is the part of a fungus that is comparable to the fruit of a plant. Unlike plants, mushrooms do not use sunlight to generate energy for themselves. Some mushrooms are edible, and are used for cooking in many countries, such as China, Korea and Europe. Other mushrooms, however, are poisonous, and can cause severe illness or death if eaten. People who search for edible mushrooms are called ""mycophagists"", meaning ""mushroom eater"", while the act itself is called ""mushrooming"". Mushrooms have been known to support bone health and to regulate blood sugar in diabetics. It is available in Different colours and Shapes."
Structure of mushrooms.
"Most mushrooms have a stem and a cap. The bottom of the cap sometimes has gills to hold spores, and sometimes holds the spores themselves."
Factorization
Factorization (also called factorisation and factoring) is taking a composite number apart into numbers that multiply together to get the original number. These smaller numbers are called factors or divisors. 1 is a factor of all numbers.
"Prime factorization is breaking apart a composite numbers into prime numbers that can be multiplied to give the larger number. Note that since 1 is not prime, it is not included in the prime factorization."
"For example, 12 can be factored as 4 × 3. Since 4 is not a prime number, that is not its prime factorization. 12's prime factorization is in fact 3 × 2 × 2."
"The numbers which are obtained from the factorization are usually ordered, for example, starting with the smallest number. For example, 72=2^3*3^2. The factorization of every number is unique. This generalizes to:"
Linga
"A linga or a lingam is a very complex Phallus symbol of Hinduism. It is associated with Shiva, supreme god in main gods of the Hindus. The Hindu scriptures say that a linga represents energy and strength. In almost all the temples of Shiva, Shiva is shown in the form of a Circumcised linga."
"The Hindu scriptures also say that Shiva took twelve forms as Jyotirlinga, that is, ""a linga of light"". In India, there are twelve places where this form of Shiva is worshiped. The Hindu scriptures also tell about five more forms of lingas. These form of lingas represent the earth, the water, the fire, the air and the sky (or ether). There are five different places in India where Hindus worship these forms of Shiva. These places are located at the following locations:"
"Beside above places, in almost all the towns and villages of India, Shiva’s temples are found. In all such temples, lingas are worshipped."
"Also in other places in the World of Ancient history, Shiva Limgam was worshipped."
United States National Guard

The National Guard is a militia (an emergency army) for the United States. Each U.S. State has its own National Guard, usually under the control of that state's government. When needed, they are mobilized under control of the United States."
"There are two parts of the United States National Guard, administered by the National Guard Bureau of the United States Department of Defense. The Air National Guard is part of the United States Air Force; the Army National Guard is part of the United States Army. The two National Guard groups are identified by the kinds of jobs they do. The Air National Guard does mainly air defense jobs, while the Army National Guard does the jobs on the ground."
Bishop's Stortford
"Bishop's Stortford is a town in Hertfordshire in south-east England, with about 35,000 people living there."
History.
People have lived in the area for hundreds of thousands of years but it became a permanent town by the time of the Saxons.
The Domesday Book says there were 120 people living there in the 1100s. The Normans built a small castle there but it was unused and broken by the time of the Tudors.
"The town grew as an important centre for transport. After 1769, ships were able to use the river. It was a stagecoach stop for travel on the road between London and Cambridge. In 1842 the town got a railway station."
"In 1901 there were 7,000 people living there, and by 1951 it was 13,000."
The town is popular for travellers to London because of the M11 motorway (an important road) and good train services to London. Stansted Airport has also caused development.
Raven
"A raven is a big black bird, (""Corvus corax""). It may be called the common raven or the northern raven. It is similar to a crow but bigger. It and the thick-billed raven are the two largest birds in the crow family, and perhaps the heaviest perching birds. The raven's feathers are all black, but a crow has feathers that are white at the bottom. This cannot be seen from a distance."

"The common raven can be tamed. Some think it is mischievous and sly, and it has been regarded as a bird of evil and mysterious character."
Malnutrition
Malnutrition is eating a diet which does not supply enough nutrients. There are two broad cateogries of malnutrition:
"Sometimes, people need to lose weight, and eat according to a special diet. This is usually not called malnutrition."
"Malnutrition is considered a more scientific and official term than starvation which has negative associations. Malnutrition is not, however, simply a matter of eating too little. Someone can be malnourished if they eat an unhealthy diet. This can be cured by eating a proper balanced diet."
"Children whose daily diet contains less carbohydrate and protein do not grow well. They do not gain weight. Their hands and legs appear as skin and bones. They cry all the time with hunger. They are not active and have sunken eyes. Such children often fall sick. Lack of a particular vitamin is another kind of malnutrition which can cause a particular deficiency disease, such as beriberi and rickets."
"Malnutrition becomes a bigger problem during famine because most of the people do not get enough food, hence increasing the death rate."

Seeing his approach, she fled to Pakhra Ching mountain. Kwakpa chased her. Seeing all these, Heibok Ningthou turned the Hiyang boat into stone and the oar into a tree. Getting angry, Kwakpa ran towards Heibok Ningthou to kill him. Then, Heibok Ningthou turned Khuman Kwakpa into a stone. Irai Leima saw all this and was afraid of her father. She left her father and ran away. She passed the Pakhra Ching, crossed the Liwa river and entered the house of Sarangthem Luwangba. She hid herself inside the granary of the house. When Sarangthem Luwangba and his good lady Thoidingjam Chanu Amurei left the house for field, Irai Leima came out from her hiding place. In the meantime, she completed all the household chores. When the couple returned home, she hid herself again. The couple got surprised at this but it happened everyday. So, one day, the man returned home earlier than usual. He found out the truth. But when he came near Irai Leima, she had disappeared below the granary. He looked under the granary but he saw nothing. He was amazed at this. So, he discussed the issue with all his clan members. They searched everywhere but didn't find her anymore."
"Irai Leima appeared in the dream of Sarangthem Luwangba and told him that she was merged into his clan and became his daughter. The matter was reported to King Senbi Kiyaamba of Ningthouja dynasty. The king sent maibas and maibis to examine the case. The examiners said that the mysterious lady was a goddess and she should be worshipped. King Kiyaamba also told Luwangba to do so. From that year onwards, Irai Leima was worshipped as a goddess."
"The day on which Luwangba first saw Irai Leima was the first Monday of the Meitei lunar month of ""Lamta (Lamda)"". And the day on which the maibas and maibis came was the first Tuesday of ""Lamta (Lamda)"". Still today, from the time of King Senbi Kiyaamba (1467-1508 AD), the Sarangthem family members annually hold a grand feast (""Chaklen Katpa"") in honor of the goddess. Later, Irai Leima came to be known as Hiyangthang Lairembi."
Worship.
"When a person gets ill after bathing in a spring, pool, stream, people believed that the water spirits (Irai Leima and Irai Ningthou) had caught the person. To get well again, people worship the two deities. For this, the maibas perform the rites and rituals. The offerings include 2 eggs and 7 bamboo vessels filled up with rice paste."
"The also highly respect the deities. They offer many wild sacrifices. The sacrifices maybe a white fowl, a pig, a dog or a he-goat."
Identification with other deities.
"Irai Leima (""Ireima"") is considered as one of the divine manifestations of Leimarel (Leimaren), the supreme mother earth goddess. She is also described as a form of goddess Imoinu."
"Irai Leima is also known as Hiyangthang Lairembi. During the reign of King Garib Niwaj (alias ""Pamheiba""), goddess Hiyangthang Lairembi was converted to Hindu goddess Kamakhya (a form of Durga). The 3rd day of Durga Puja is observed as the ""Bor Numit"" (literally, Boon Day)."

(She died in Malacca, now part of Malaysia, on 2 November 1664, at the age of 35). The couple had eight children, most of whom did not live through infancy. Their son Abraham van Riebeeck, born at the Cape, later became Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies."

Measles
"Measles is an infectious disease, caused by a virus. People catch measles from other people. It is passed on in tiny drops of water when people breathe. People with measles have a sore throat, a fever, a cough, red eyes and a runny nose. They also have a bumpy red rash all over their body. These rashes will cause a high irritation of itching."
"Measles is very infectious, which means it is easy to catch. If someone in a house has measles, it is very likely that other people in the house will also get it. In developed countries, lots of children have a vaccination (injection) to stop them from getting measles. Often they are given the MMR vaccine, to stop them getting measles, mumps and rubella. The three vaccinations are all in one injection."
"Measles is sometimes also called ""rubeola"", but it is not the same as rubella (German measles). The German Measles (rubella) was discovered by German scientists."
"There is no specific cure for measles. People with measles may rest and take medicines to make them feel better, to stop pain and make fevers go away. Most people that have measles recover, but some people die from it. In the 19th century measles epidemics killed many Polynesian people."
Emperor Seinei
"was the 22nd emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Seinei to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Seinei""-tennō"" was created for him posthumously by later generations."
"No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as ""traditional"" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty."
Traditional history.
"According to ""Kojiki"" and ""Nihonshoki"", Seinei was a son of Emperor Yūryaku."
Seinei fathered no children. He adopted two grandsons of Emperor Richū. Each would attain the throne; and they would become known as Emperor Ninken and as Emperor Kenzo
Events of Seinei's life.
"Very little is known about the events of Seinei's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei."
"After the death of his father, Seinei overcame others in the struggle for power."
After his death.
This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Seinei.
"According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (""kofun""). This emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (""misasagi"") which is associated with the burial mound."
Xiphactinus
"Nat’s daughter, Natalie followed her father as a singer. She recorded many songs after her father died. In 1991, Natalie Cole recorded an album called ""Unforgettable"". It contains 22 of Nat King Cole’s songs, including the song “Unforgettable.” Modern technology made it possible to mix her voice with a recording of her father singing the same song."
Voice of America
"The Voice of America (VOA) is the official broadcasting service of the United States government. It is one of the best-known stations in international broadcasting. Along with English, VOA broadcasts in many other languages. VOA's broadcasts are made to share a positive view of the United States with the world. Americans in the United States are not part of VOA's intended audience, but many Americans do listen to the program."
History.
"VOA was organized in 1942 under the Office of War Information with news programs aimed at Europe and North Africa occupied by Germany. VOA began broadcasting on February 24, 1942, but VOA noted in its site that it began broadcasting on February 1, 1942. Transmitters used by VOA came from shortwave transmitters used by the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) and National Broadcasting Company (NBC). Voice of America began to transmit radio broadcasts into the Soviet Union on February 17, 1947."
"During the Cold War, VOA's budget was reduced. On August 1, 1953, VOA was separated from the Department of State and it was included under the Information Agency. VOA moved its headquarters from New York to Washington, DC. next year. In 1959 VOA started ""Special English"" programs. In the 1980s, VOA also added a television service, as well as special regional programs to Cuba, Radio Marti and TV Marti."
"One of VOA's famous programs was remembered as ""Jazz Hour"" presented by Willis Conover. This program continued for 40 years, and its record remains at the National Museum of American History, also known as """"Smithsonian""."

The Voice of America broadcasts in 46 different languages. Television broadcasts are marked with a star:
George Gershwin
"George Gershwin (September 26, 1898; Brooklyn, New York – July 11, 1937; Hollywood, California) was an American composer and a pianist."
Story of his life.
Childhood.
"George Gershwin was born on September 26, 1898, in Brooklyn, New York."
"His family immigrated to the United States. Gershwin, his two brothers and sister had a close, happy family life. George liked playing games on the streets of New York. He liked exploring the city, but he did not like school or studying."
"While exploring the city, Gershwin heard jazz and blues music spilling out of public drinking places. However, he did not become seriously interested in music until he heard another boy playing the violin in a concert at his school. Gershwin began to take piano lessons. His teacher was a fine classical musician. He immediately recognized Gershwin's unusual ability. The teacher wrote about him to a friend: ""I have a student who will make his mark in music, if anybody will. The boy is a genius, without doubt."""
Younger days as a student.
"Gershwin studied classical piano, and he was a first-rate pianist,but his strongest interest continued to be jazz and popular music. He loved playing piano and it was his passion. At the age of fifteen, he left school and went to work in the music business. The New York City street where most music publishers had their offices was called ""Tin Pan Alley."""
"The phonograph and radio had been invented in the late 1800s. But it would be many years before there were musical recordings or regular radio broadcasts. Tin Pan Alley publishers needed another way to sell new songs, so they employed people to play the piano to do this."
"The piano players played the songs all day long to interested singers and other performers. Gershwin was one of the youngest piano players in Tin Pan Alley. Soon, he was considered one of the finest there. He was already writing his own songs. He succeeded in getting one published when he was only 18 years old. It had a long title: ""When You Want 'Em, You Can't Get ‘Em, When You've Got 'Em, You Don't Want 'Em. """
Success as a songwriter.
"Gershwin was now a real composer. The rest of his life was an unbroken record of success. He wrote song after song. His ideas were so endless that he was not even troubled when he once lost some music he had been writing. ""There is plenty more where that came from,"" he said."
"Gershwin had his first big hit in 1919, when he was twenty-one years old. It was a song called ""Swanee."" A popular entertainer, Al Jolson, sang the song. ""Swanee"" was made into one of the first musical recordings. Gershwin was suddenly famous. He also was in the Grammy Hall of Fame."
"Music critics note that ""Swanee"" is not like most of Gershwin's music. Later, he wrote true love songs. Some were light and funny. Some were full of intense feeling. Many of these songs were written for the popular musical theater. One of his most emotional love songs never became part of a musical play, however. It is called ""The Man I love."" The song was sung by the Francine Evans role [played by Liza Minnelli in Martin Scorsese's film, New York, New York] and supposedly 'written' by her character for her soon to be husband, Jimmy Doyle [superbly played by Robert De Niro], of the Jimmy Doyle Orchestra. His character also 'wrote' the title song, New York, New York, who was actually written by Fred Ebb, music by Kanter, his partner. The song became New York's official anthem in 1985."
His brother Ira.
"Gershwin's older brother, Ira, wrote the words to ""The Man I Love"". As George became famous, Ira wrote the words to more and more of his songs."
"The two brothers were very different. Ira, the writer, was quiet and serious. George, the musician, was outgoing—the life of any party. When they had to finish a new musical Ira locked George in a hotel room until it was done. But George wrote better songs with Ira than with anyone else."
Music of Gershwin.
As a songwriter.
"One of many examples of the Gershwin's combined work is the song ""They Can't Take That Away From Me."" The Gershwins wrote the song for dancer and actor Fred Astaire for the film ""Shall We Dance."" That was George and Ira Gershwin's first movie musical."
Azemiopinae
"Azemiopinae, commonly known as the ""Fea's vipers"", is a monotypic subfamily made for a monotypic genus, ""Azemiops"", which contains the venomous viper, Azemiops Feae. It is found on the mountains of Southeast Asia."
Description.
"The Feas's vipers can grow up to the length of 77 cm. They are blueish-gray or black in color with orange crossbands, the head is orange while the chin and throat is yellow, it also has yellow eyes."
Where they live.
"The Fea's viper is found in northern Vietnam, southern China, south-east Myanmar, and south-east Tibet. In China the Fea's viper is found in Fujien, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Kweichow, Sichuan, Yunnan, Zhejiang."
Habitat.
The Fea's viper is found on mountains which have an altitude of 1000 meters. It prefers to live in cool climates which have an average temperature of 18-25 °C. In Vietnam it is found in bamboo forests.
Behavior.
"The Fea's viper is said to be nocturnal, but some people say that it crepuscular, and it hibernates in the winter. When disturbed, the Fea's viper flattens its body to make it look wider, and opens its mouth widely to show its fangs, giving its head a triangular shape. It sometimes also vibrates it tail. Fea's vipers are said to eat small mammals."
Parable of the Prodigal Son
"The Parable of the Prodigal Son is one of the parables of Jesus. It is found only in the Gospel of Luke at 15:11-32. The parable is about a son who wastes his share of his father's estate. He loses all his money and gets work feeding pigs—one of the lowest jobs a person can do according to the Jewish religion. He repents and returns to his father's house. He is welcomed and a feast is held. His older, dutiful brother who has worked without reward for his father resents the fuss made over the prodigal son. His father reminds him that all he has is his. He says they should still celebrate the return of the younger boy because he has come back to them. In the Western Catholic church, this parable is usually read on the third Sunday of Lent. In the Eastern Orthodox Church it is read on the ""Sunday of the Prodigal Son"". The parable is the subject of much art, music, literature, and stage works."
"This is the last of three parables about loss and redemption. It follows the Parable of the Lost Sheep and the Parable of the Lost Coin. Jesus tells this parable after the Pharisees and religious leaders accuse him of welcoming and eating with ""sinners."" The father's joy described in the parable reflects divine love, the ""boundless mercy of God,"" and ""God's refusal to limit the measure of his grace."""
Parable of the Mustard Seed
"The Parable of the Mustard Seed is one of the parables of Jesus. It is found in three of the Gospels of the New Testament: Gospel of Matthew (13:31–32), Gospel of Mark (4:30–32), and Gospel of Luke (13:18–19). The differences among the three tellings are minor."
"In Matthew and Luke, this parable is followed by the Parable of the Leaven. The Parable of the Leaven also has a theme about the Kingdom of Heaven growing from small beginnings. A version of the parable also occurs in the non-canonical Gospel of Thomas 20."
"The parable from Matthew reads: ""The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field; which indeed is smaller than all seeds. But when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches."" The parables from Mark and Luke are similar."
Parable of the Lost Sheep
"The Parable of the Lost Sheep is one of the parables of Jesus. It is found in the Gospel of Matthew at 18:12–14 and the Gospel of Luke at 15:3–7. It also appears in the non-canonical Gospel of Thomas. The parable is one of three that tell of loss and redemption. The others are The Lost Coin and The Prodigal Son. The Lost Sheep tells of a shepherd who leaves his 99 sheep to search for one sheep that is lost. Joel B. Green writes that ""these parables are ... about God, ... their aim is to lay bare the nature of the divine response to the recovery of the lost."" The parable has been depicted often in art."
Brandenburg Gate (Potsdam)
"The Brandenburg Gate () on the ""Luisenplatz"" in Potsdam, should not be confused with the gate of the same name on Berlin's ""Pariser Platz"", it was built in 1770/71 by Carl von Gontard and Georg Christian Unger by order of Frederick II of Prussia. It stands at the western end of ""Brandenburger Straße"", which runs in a straight line up to the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul."
"Previously, from 1733, there was another, simpler gate on the same spot, which resembled a castle gateway. Together with the city wall, a form of toll barrier, and the other gates it was intended to prevent desertion and smuggling."
"Towards the end of the Seven Years' War, Frederick the Great had the old gate demolished and built, in its stead, this new Brandenburg Gate, as a symbol of his victory."
Since the city wall was demolished around 1900 the Brandenburg Gate has been a free-standing structure.

Determiners.
"Determiners are words placed in front of a noun to make it clear what the noun refers to. The difference is each noun can only have one determiner and the determiner always comes before all the other parts of the noun phrase. The most common determiners in English are ""the"" and ""a/an""."
Adverbs.
"Adverbs are words that tell you about words that are not nouns. An adverb can describe a verb, like the word ""quickly"" in the sentence ""He ran quickly."" They can also describe an adjective. The adverb ""very"" describes the adjective ""sick"" in the sentence ""The boy is very sick."" Adverbs can even describe other adverbs, as in the sentence ""He ran very quickly."""
Prepositions.
"A preposition is a word that describes how one noun (or pronoun) relates to another in the sentence as a whole. The preposition usually comes before the noun that it adds to the sentence, which is called the object of the preposition. An example is the word ""over"" in the sentence ""he walked over the bridge."""
Conjunctions.
"A conjunction is a word that connects other parts of a sentence. It can connect two words that both do the same thing in a sentence. ""And"" in the sentence ""the boy and the girl run"" connects the boy to the girl because they both run. Conjunctions can even connect two clauses that would normally be different sentences together. The word ""but"" in the sentence ""I like cats, but he likes dogs"" is a conjunction doing this."
Interjections.
"Interjections are words that do not fit normal grammar rules. Interjections can and often do take the place of an entire sentence, as they can give they meaning of a whole sentence in a single word. These can be used to show emotions, such as the word ""Hooray,"" which means that the speaker is happy or likes something. They are also used to shorten common phrases that would otherwise need a full sentence to talk about. For example, saying the word ""yes"" is much simpler than saying ""what you say is true,"" so it is usually used instead. Interjections like these can be helpful for saving time and making complex sentences very simple. Often, though, interjections may have no meaning at all, such as the word ""um."""
Syntax.
"Grammar also studies how the parts of language work together. This is called ""syntax."" Some common ways in which the words fit together are sentences, phrases, clauses, and paragraphs."

Problem signs.
"Unintentional weight loss is when a person loses weight without trying. It can be a symptom of some types of cancer. Stress can cause unintentional weight loss. Stress can come from divorce, changing jobs or over the loss of a loved one. Once the stress is removed and the person feels happier again, the weight may return to normal. Depression may also cause weight loss. Eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia can cause significant weight loss. These disorders usually require the help of health care professionals."
Sleeping.
"Getting enough sleep helps to avoid gaining excess weight. Over time, getting more sleep can help a person to lose weight. The main reason is not getting enough sleep leaves a person tired during the day and prone to eating more food. Getting enough sleep helps in maintaining healthy eating habits."
With every breath.
"Without going to the bathroom, a person naturally loses over while they sleep at night. One reason is humans breathe in oxygen but breathes out carbon dioxide. That is breathing in one molecule of Oxygen for every two molecules of carbon each time they breathe out. A molecule of carbon does not weigh much by itself, but given that with each breath twenty billion-trillion molecules are expelled, over a 7-8 hour period that adds up to over a pound of carbon. Normal perspiration occurs while sleeping but usually only causes a small amount of water weight loss."
Your body also burns calories while you sleep.
Diet vs exercise.
"It is well known that lean mass (muscle and bone) burn more energy than fat. Even at rest, a body with more muscle tissue will burn more calories."
Exercise alone can be effective in weight loss. Several studies found similar results. The comparison between dieting and exercising found both resulted in weight loss. The conclusion was that using both diet and exercise together was the most effective method of weight loss and in maintaining a healthy body.

Harp.
"There are seven pedals on a concert harp. Each pedal can be in a high, middle or low position. The strings of the harp can be thought of like the white notes of a piano, tuned to naturals (C,D,E etc.). Each pedal can change one of the letter-named notes one semitone higher or lower. For example: the pedal on the left changes all the Ds to D flat (if the pedal is in the highest position) or D sharp (in the lowest position). From left to right the pedals operate the Ds, Cs, Bs, Es, Fs, Gs and As."
Timpani.
Pedal timpani are timpani with a pedal which will tighten or loosen the drumhead. This will make the note go up or down in pitch. It is a fairly new invention. Composers in the Classical music period never had pedal timpani. Their timpani always had to be tuned by hand using the taps around the side. Composers like Béla Bartók wrote for pedal timpani.
Harpsichord.
Modern harpsichords often have pedals which change the sound in the same way that stops on an organ change the sound. In earlier harpsichords the sound was more often changed by pushing in or pulling out hand stops.
Alcoholism

Diagnosis.
"Being an alcoholic does not mean that a person just drinks a lot of alcohol. It means that they cannot control how much alcohol they drink. No matter how badly they want to, once they take one drink, they cannot stop drinking."
"To be diagnosed with alcoholism, a person has to have three of these symptoms in the past year:"
"There is no medical test, like a blood test, that can say whether a person is an alcoholic. There are some questionnaires (lists of questions) that can help tell whether a person ""may"" be an alcoholic. These questionnaires include the CAGE questionnaire (for adults) and the CRAFFT Screening Test (for teenagers)."
Alcoholism causes many problems.
Problems in the body.
"Alcoholism can cause many health problems. For example, it can cause:"
"If a person drinks too much at one time, they can get alcohol poisoning. This can cause breathing problems, coma, and even death."
"In 2012, alcohol use caused 3.3 million deaths around the world. This means that in 2012, about 3 out of every 50 deaths in the world were caused by alcohol use."
Problems in life.
Alcoholism can also cause many problems in alcoholics' lives. These include:
Alcohol withdrawal.
"If an alcoholic stops drinking suddenly, they can get alcohol withdrawal."
"The most serious form of alcohol withdrawal is delirium tremens (often called ""DTs""). Delirium tremens is a medical emergency. Many people who get the DTs die from them."
This does not mean that alcoholics should not stop drinking. It means that alcoholics should talk to a doctor or go to a hospital before they stop drinking. Doctors can give medications to make sure that a person is safe while they stop drinking.
Epidemiology.
"In 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that there were 208 million people with alcoholism around the world. (This is 4.1% of the world's population over age 15.) In 2001, the WHO estimated that there were about 140 million alcoholics around the world. This means that in the nine years between 2001 and 2010, about 68 million people became alcoholics."

"In 2008, Lee ran for a seat in the National Assembly. She was the first North Korean defector to do this."
"In 2009, Lee started the Hana Defector Women's Organization. The NGO helps North Korean women who live in South Korea. The women receive job training, childcare, help with education, and human rights training."
Lee became the head of the North Korean Traditional Food Institute in 2012. The institute tries to bring North and South Korea closer together. It gives vocational training to North Korean defectors. It also teaches about the food traditions of Pyongyang.
"Also in 2012, Lee led an 18-day hunger strike in front of the Chinese embassy. Lee protested against China, because they wanted to send North Korean refugees back to North Korea."
Awards.
Lee received a 2010 International Women of Courage Award from the U.S. Department of State.
Wasted username
A wasted username or wasted account is a user account on a website that was not used very much (or at all) after it was made. A person who makes an account like this is called a namewaster or a name waster.
"This word came from YouTube, where many people would post both funny and hateful comments on namewasters' YouTube channels. This was an Internet phenomenon until 2012, when YouTube deleted a lot of these wasted accounts."
Chain mail
"Mail, or chain mail, is a type of armour. It is made of small metal rings linked together in a pattern to form a mesh. The Celts are usually credited with inventing mail armour. Celtic mail was usually made in the form of a vest."
Etymology.
"The origins* of the word ""mail"" are not fully known. One theory is that it originally comes from the Latin word ""macula"", meaning ""spot"" or ""opacity"". Another theory relates the word to the Old French ""maillier"", meaning “to hammer” (related to the modern English word ""malleable""). A mail shirt is a called a hauberk (haubergeon or byrnie). Mail leggings were called chausses. A mail Hood is called a coif and covered the head, neck and shoulders."
History.
"Many scholars think mail was invented by ancient Celts about the 3rd century BC. At that time their iron work was probably the best in Europe. The Romans quickly adopted it for their own army. A shirt of mail armour weighed about . After a battle it was common practice to strip weapons and armour from the dead. Vikings were known to wear mail armor whenever they could get their hands on it. Mail was expensive, time-consuming to make, and required a supply of iron. It became more expensive as improvements were made in materials and workmanship. Mail armour was in use in Europe until the 15th century."
Modern uses.
Mail is today used in gloves to prevent cuts by butchers and firefighters. Some divers wear mail suits when swimming around sharks and particularly when feeding sharks. But mail is heavy and it makes moving around more difficult. Mail is very popular with history reenactors. It is also popular in live action role playing.
Afar Triangle
The Afar Triangle (or Afar Depression) is a low area bordering on the Red Sea. It is part of the Great Rift Valley in East Africa.
"The area overlaps the borders of Eritrea, Djibouti and the entire Afar region of Ethiopia."
Human fossils.
Important fossil specimens of the earliest hominins have been found in this area. These are the earliest of the human clade. The area is thought by some paleontologists to be the cradle of the evolution of humans.
"Many important fossil localities exist in the Afar region. These sites have produced specimens of the earliest (fossil) hominins and of human tool culture, as well as many fossils of flora and fauna."
Geography.
"The Triangle includes the lowest point in Africa, Lake Asal, Djibouti, at 155 m (or 509 ft) below sea level."
"The Awash River is the main waterflow into the region. It runs dry during the annual dry season, and ends as a chain of saline lakes. The northern part of the Afar Depression is also known as the Danakil Depression. The lowlands are affected by heat, drought, and poor air circulation. Some of the lowlands are the hottest places (year-round average temperatures) of anywhere on Earth."
"The Afar Triangle is bordered by high areas, as shown on the topographic map."
Plate tectonics.
"The Depression is a plate tectonic triple junction. This geologic feature is one of earth's great active volcanic areas, so the floor of the depression is composed of lava, mostly basalt."
Other reeds can be made from metal or plastic.
Nuuk
"Nuuk (Danish: Godthaab or Godthåb) is the capital of Greenland. It is around the mouth of island Nuup Kangerlua (Danish: ""Godthåbsfjorden"") on the west coast of Greenland, about 240 km (150 mi) south of the Arctic Circle. The city has a population of 15,047 people."
"It was founded in 1728 by the Norwegian missionary Hans Egede. Egede named the city Godthåb which means ""Good Hope"". Today, the people of Nuuk are mainly Inuit and Danes."
Nuuk is the location of the University of Greenland.
Lumberjack
"A lumberjack is a person who cuts down trees to be made into lumber. Lumberjacks used to cut with axes, but now lumberjacks use chainsaws."
Muhammad
"Muhammad ( – 8 June 632) was an Arab religious, political and social leader. He founded the religion of Islam."
"Born in Mecca, Muhammad's parents died in his childhood and he grew as an orphan. At the age of six, his grandfather Abd al-Muttalib took care of him, though he died just two years later. In young life, Muhammad accompanied his uncle Abu Talib on trade trips. In 610 AD, at the age of forty, while Muhammad was praying, he reportedly met Gabriel and received the first revelation of the Quran. At first, Muhammad preached these revelations to his close friends and family. He started preaching monotheism publicly where he received opposition from the Meccan polytheists. The polytheists boycotted Muhammad for three years, in which Muhammad could barely eat or drink. He was attacked with stones, ridiculed while praying, and eventually forced to leave his hometown of Mecca."
"While Muhammad was traveling towards Medina, he came across Taif and preached there where polytheists threw stones, causing Muhammad to bleed and almost collapse. After reaching Medina with Abu Bakr, the Medinan Muslims helped Muhammad and made a mosque there."
"He is believed to be a descendant of Ishmael, a son of Abraham, and the last of all prophets (""the seal of the prophets""). He is seen as an example for all Muslims to follow."
Life.
Childhood.
"Muhammad was born about 570 AD in Mecca. His father, whose name was Abdullah, died six months before Muhammad's birth. His mother, Amina, died when he was six years old. So, his grandfather, Abdul-Muttalib, took care of him after the death of Amina but he too died two years later when Muhammad was nine. After his grandfather's death, his uncle Abu Talib took care of him and was a support to him for many years of his adult life."
Beginning of the prophethood.
"In 610 AD, when Muhammad was forty years old, he went for a walk to the mountain of Hira near Mecca. According to Muslims, the angel Jibrail (Gabriel) spoke with him in a cave on the mountain. The story says that when Muhammad first saw the angel Gabriel, he fainted because Gabriel was so large. This is what Jibrail said to Muhammad:"
"""Read... in the name of God Who made man from a drop of blood... God is Most Rewarding... He Who taught man to write with pen... and taught man what he knew not."""
"Muhammad went back home to his wife Khadijah and told her what had happened. New revelations came to him commanding him to preach what was being sent ""down"" from God. When Muhammad first started teaching, many of the people of Mecca, who worshipped idols, did not like the things that Muhammad said. But there were also people who listened to his preaching and obeyed his messages. These people were the first of the followers of Islam. Leaders of Mecca punished and tortured the followers of Islam. Some followers of Islam were executed. Muhammad resisted this and continued to teach Islam."
The Hijrah.
"After Muhammad finished in Mecca, he took his message to Medina, where some people learned about him and his followers. They welcomed him into their city, and Muhammad wanted them to convert to Islam. They agreed, and many of his followers went to Medina. This movement from Mecca to Medina is called the ""Hijrah"". The Hijra was also the beginning of the Islamic calendar. Muhammad stayed behind until all of his people left Mecca safely."
"As Muhammad stayed in Mecca, his uncle Abu Lahab trained seven men to kill Muhammad in his sleep. According to history, they did not see him leave Mecca. The men went into his house and found his cousin, Ali. Abu Lahab and his horsemen went to the desert to look for him and his friend, Abu Bakr."
His stay in Medina.
"Muhammad and Abu Bakr arrived in Medina. Some people welcomed Muhammad to their homes. He used his camel to show everyone where he would build his house. Also, the first mosque of Medina, a small place for prayer, was built in the back of this house."
The people in a strong Jewish tribe in Medina disagreed with the teachings and rules set by Muhammad. This tribe told their allies in Mecca to sell all the things and homes that Muslims of Mecca left behind. The Muslims and those from Mecca were advised to fight for their property. Muhammad told them not to do that.
Muslims were called all over Medina to gather at a mosque that Muhammad prayed in. They were told to fight against the people of Mecca who burned down their homes and stole their property.
The wars.
"The Quraysh pagans of Mecca heard about this, and they sent a larger army numbering 1000 warriors to fight the Muslims. They met in Badr, but the pagans were defeated and Abu Jahl, one of the pagan leaders, was also killed."
"But, the Muslims lost the second battle at Uhud. One year after the fight at Badr, the army of Mecca had outside help. Muslim archers failed to listen to Muhammad's instructions and Khalid ibn al-Walid cleverly took advantage of that. Hamza, Muhammad's last uncle, was killed when a slave from Mecca threw a spear into his chest. Muhammad himself was injured."

List A
"List A cricket (also known as List A) is a classification of the limited-overs (one-day) form of the sport of cricket, with games lasting up to eight hours. List A cricket includes One Day International (ODI) matches and various domestic competitions in which the number of overs in an innings per team ranges from forty to sixty, as well as some international matches involving nations who have not achieved official ODI status. Together with first-class and Twenty20 cricket, List A is one of the three major forms of cricket recognised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). In November 2021, the ICC retrospectively applied List A status to women's cricket, aligning it with the men's game."
Kona coffee
"Kona Coffee is one of the kinds of coffee that is made in Kona, Hawaii. And it is famous for being the second most expensive coffee in the world following the Blue Mountains. It is too rare and accounts for only less than 0.1% of all coffee production all over the world."
History.
"In 1825, the person who was one of the royal family of Hawaii went to Britain with the king of Hawaii and brought coffee plants on the way home. Those plants spread to many regions of Hawaii. In 1828, coffee plants were planted in the Kona region. After that, many farms were made there. But, because of pest damage and the price decline of coffee, most farmers quit their jobs. In this situation, Japanese immigrants moved to the Kona region and started to grow coffee to pay their land cost by coffee. This is the beginning of kona coffee. Now, Kona coffee is drunk at the dinner party in White House because this is the only coffee that is grown in America and the quality is quite high."
Distribution.
"Kona is one of the districts of Hawaii, and it is located western. Also,it is the only place which grows coffee in the U.S. states. It has a good natural environment for growing coffee thanks to some volcanoes that give soil many nutrients. Also, the unique oceanic climate of the Kona region, which is cooler and rains a lot more than that of flat ground, is good for growing coffee. Furthermore, there is a terroir that is called “ Kona coffee belt” that is around 32 km long and 3.2 wide area. In this territory, there are many farms and shops that sell Kona coffee directly from the farms and as much as 900,000 kg of coffee beans are harvested annually."
Kona blends and Flavor coffee.
"There are some blended Kona coffees that are made by mixing some kinds of coffee beans because 100% Kona coffee is quite expensive because of labor and land cost. In the Hawaii-grow coffee law, blended coffee that accounted for 10% of Kona coffee beans can be called Kona blended coffee. The coffees that have extra flavor like macadamia nut, vanilla and so on are also famous. Those flavor coffees are made by adding flavor during roasting."
Taste.
"This coffee has a less bitter taste and softly sourness. Because of its great sourness, this coffee is called “Queen of sourness”. You can feel the sweet and fresh smell like tropical fruits. Also Kona coffee is graded 5 stages according to the size of the beans. The bigger beans are graded better and those coffee beans have better taste. The biggest coffee beans are called “extra fancy” and there are only 15 % of Kona coffee. Following “fancy”, “No 1”, “select”, “prime”. Other coffee beans are called “ Hawaiian coffee”. Also, there are coffee beans which are called Peaberry. It is round beans although originally one is half round. Those coffee beans contain more nutrition."

Tulle is twinned with:
English grammar
"English grammar is the grammar of the English language. Grammar is the rules about how to speak and write in a language. English grammar started out based on Old English, which is considered to be a Germanic language. After the Norman French conquered England in 1066, parts of the Latin language were brought to the English language by the Norman French."
Dialect grammar.
"Dialects of English vary not only in pronunciation but in grammar. For example, people who use what is called General American English or BBC English might say, ""I didn't do anything"", while someone who speaks what is called African American Vernacular English might say, ""I didn't do nothing"". London working class version: ""I ain't done nuffink!"" The dialect a person uses is usually decided by where they live."
"Even though the dialects of English use different words or word order, they still have grammar rules. However, when writing in American English, grammar uses the rules of General American English. When people talk about using ""proper English"", they usually mean using the grammar of general British English, as described in standard reference works. The models for ""spoken"" English in Britain are often called Received Pronunciation or BBC English."
Word endings.
"English makes few changes to its word endings. These are called ('suffixes'): plurals and possessives (""John's"") are the most common. English verbs drop most endings except one: I love, you love, they love, but ""she loves"". That final 's' is a remnant of Anglo-Saxon, which had more suffixes. Verbs do have endings which show changes in tense: walked, walking."
Word order.
"Word order is the other big difference. In English, adjectives usually come before the noun. Most Romance languages normally put their adjectives after the nouns. For example, in English, a person may say ""I like fast cars"", but in Spanish, it is ""Me gustan los coches rápidos"" [coches = cars; rápidos = fast]. The order of the words has changed: if just the words, without the grammar, are translated into English, it would mean 'to me they please the cars fast'. This is because Spanish and English have different rules about word order. In German, main verbs often come near the end of sentences, but in English we usually put them between subject and object, as: ""the cat sat on the mat""."
Parts of speech.
"Grammar studies the different parts of language. The parts of language are called ""parts of speech."" The parts of speech are nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections."
Nouns.
"A noun is a word that names something, such as a person, place, thing, or idea. They can be a single thing such as an apple. They can also be plural such as a box of apples. There is a special kind of noun called a proper noun, which is a name. For instance, Johnny Appleseed."
Pronouns.
"Pronouns are words that take the place of nouns. We often use them to avoid repeating the nouns that they refer to. An example is the word ""it."" In the sentence ""I like the ball; it is blue,"" you have to look at what comes before ""it"" to know that ""it"" is talking about the ball. The noun before a pronoun that the pronoun really means is called the antecedent."
There are different types of pronouns in English language. The most important ones are:
Verbs.
"The basic verb form is called the infinitive. The infinitive for existence is ""to be"". A famous example is the speech of Hamlet: to be or not to be?"
Variations of the infinitive create verb tenses.
Adjectives.
"Words that tell you about nouns are called adjectives. When an adjective is used, you learn more about the noun. An example would be the words ""red"" and ""juicy"" in the phrase ""the red apple is juicy."" They do not have any endings. Even if the noun they talk about is plural, they stay the same. You can see this in the sentence ""the red apples are juicy."""
Boyce and Hart
"Boyce and Hart were a musical and songwriting duo, who worked together in the 1960s and 1970s. Tommy Boyce (born Sidney Thomas Boyce in 1939 and died in 1994) and Bobby Hart (born Robert Luke Harshman in 1939) wrote and produced hit records for The Monkees (""Last Train to Clarksville"", ""Valleri""), Jay and the Americans (""Come a Little Bit Closer""), Chubby Checker (""Lazy Elsie Molly""), and for themselves, with ""I Wonder What She's Doing Tonight"" and other songs."
"Their biggest success was with the Monkees, as writers, producers and performers. Many of the early Monkees recordings featured Boyce and Hart's band, the Candy Store Prophets, before the Monkees were even selected from auditions. When the Monkees themselves took charge of their recordings, they still recorded Boyce and Hart's songs, and praised the duo to the public."
"Ten years after the Monkees's heyday, two former members, Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones, teamed up with Boyce and Hart, touring and performing the band's hits. They also issued a new album on Capitol Records."

Dappy
"Costadinos Contostavlos, better known by his stage name of ""Dappy"", is an English rapper, singer and songwriter of Greek heritage. He leads the hip hop group N-Dubz. Contostavlos was raised on a Camden Town council estate, North London by his mother, Zoe Contostavlos and father, Byron Contostavlos. His father was the bassist in 1970s group Mungo Jerry.Contostavlos is from Greek origin but speaks fluent English with a classic North London accent. He does not think of himself to be ""English in anyway"". At home he speaks Greek. He says he is a ""foreign guy that lives in Camden"". He wears unusual hats. His trademark is a selection of woolly fleece lined hats with big pom-poms on the top and strings on the sides. These have been called ""Dappy hats"". He normally turns up one side of the hat."
Early life and current status.
"Dappy was born in Camden Town, London. It is said that he grew up in a small council flat with his parents and older brother. He actually lived in a large townhouse because his father was a member of 1970s band Mungo Jerry. In an interview he gave to The Sun, he said that the estate he lived on was ""rough and lots of the kids I saw got into drugs or fights"". Dappy showed interest in music from a young age. He started performing around Camden Town at the age of 13 years old. He performed with band members Richard ""Fazer"" Rawson and Tula ""Tulisa"" Contostavlos, who is his cousin. At the time they were called the ""Lickle Rinsers Crew"". Contostavlos and his band-mates studied at Haverstock School. Contostavlos was forced to leave the school when he was 15, for multiple truancies and fighting. He later went back to study at college and received a GCSE A* in English. His father, Byron was, to Dappy, the ""inspiration behind the band"". With the money he made from his time in the band, Bryon set up a small studio for the band. When Byron died, the song N-Dubz wrote ""Papa (Can You Hear Me?)"" was played at his funeral. It became the group's best hit at #19, and at #17 in the download charts. Dappy later had the words ""RIP Dad"" tattooed on his neck. He refers to his dad as ""B"" or ""Uncle B""."
He is a housemate in the 2014 series of Celebrity Big Brother (UK).
Personal life.
"N-Dubz were forced to change some of their live shows from the Uncle B tour after Dappy got temporary deafness. He later said that it ""was terrible and it has really taught me to take better care of my ears because I wouldn't be the musician I am today if I couldn't hear."""
Criticism.
"In 2007 Dappy released ""Love For My Slum"" with fellow UK rap artist Baker Trouble. It was number one on Channel U for several weeks. It did not do as well with the media. It was heavily criticised for a scene in which Dappy is stood outside a block of expensive luxury flats with a ""rich kid"" who is trying to look like a gangster. ""The Independent"" wrote ""His lyrics combine jealousy with anger: 'You got too much to lose / You're in a great position... You wouldn't last a minute where I'm from / You'd go missing / So appreciate what you got / 'cos I'm still wishing.' And then he grabs the rich kid by his coat, pulls him toward him, and punches him in the face. The silent boy falls instantly to the pavement..."", they then went on to put ""Do scenes like these suggest that music videos are encouraging their viewers to indulge in criminality?"". Other newspapers put that he was ""idolising thuggery"". When asked in interviews about the single, and these comments he said ""these people need to listen to the lyrics, they are about showing appreciation to what you've got""."
"In December 2008, Contostavlos pleaded guilty to two counts of assault at Chelmsford Magistrates Court, Essex. He spat in a girl's face while drunk on a night out. He got four weeks' imprisonment, suspended for 12 months and 100 hours community service. He was also ordered to pay £50 to the girl and her friend, and £300 costs."
"Critics of Putin say that he has taken away people's freedoms, and that he has failed to make the country more developed. Russia makes lots of money from selling oil and gas to other countries, but because of corruption, this money is not used for improving living conditions."
"Recently, the Russian opposition has held anti-government rallies, campaigned against Putin on the Internet, and published independent reports for the general public. Because of censorship in the mass media, it's very difficult to get different information out to the public."
Putin was against invading Libya in 2011. He is also against invading Syria and Iran.
"On March 24, 2014, Putin and Russia were suspended from the G8. This was because the United States thought that the Ukraine crisis was Putin's fault."
"According to the Constitution of Russia, no-one can be president three times in a row. Because of this, Putin didn't put himself forward for the March 2008 election. However, you're allowed to be president as many times as you want, as long as it's not for more than two times in a row. In March 2012, Putin put himself forward for the elections, and won 64% of the vote. This means that he was the president of Russia until 2018."
"On December 6, 2017 Russia President Vladimir Putin announced he would run for a fourth term in the upcoming election, 2018 Russian Presidential Election."
"In July 2020, Russian voters backed a referendum that would allow Putin to serve as president until 2036."
"On 24 February 2022, Putin announced that his military was going to invade Ukraine. This happened after a year of tension and military buildup between the two countries. The invasion led to many calling Putin a war criminal and wanting him to be prosecuted as a war criminal."
Personal life.
"He is a member of the Russian Orthodox Church, and is divorced with two daughters."
Henry VII of England
Henry VII or Henry Tudor (28 January 1457–21 April 1509) was King of England from 1485 to 1509. He founded the Tudor dynasty by winning the battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. His son became king Henry VIII of England.
Biography.
"Henry VII was born in 1457 to Edmund Tudor and Margaret Beaufort. His father died two months before he was born, leaving his 13-year-old mother as his only parent. After Henry's birth, he spent a lot of time with his uncle Jasper Tudor. Jasper took Henry to France, where he spent most of his youth. Henry had a claim to the throne of England, but it was not a very good one, and he had to wait a long time for a chance to take the throne."
"In 1483, a new king came to the throne in England, called Richard III. King Richard was not popular with everyone. Some thought he had stolen the throne from his young nephews and had killed them. This gave Henry the chance he had been waiting for. With help from the French, he raised an army. They landed at Dale in Pembrokeshire, close to where Henry had been born, so he was able to gather more supporters on the way."
"The Wars of the Roses (1455–1485) had been going on for years. They were fought over the throne of England between supporters of the House of Lancaster and supporters of the House of York. Both houses were branches of the Plantagenet royal house, tracing their descent from King Edward III."
King Henry VI and his family the House of Lancaster fought against their enemies for many years. The wars finally came to an end when King Henry VII of England came to the throne in 1485
"On 22 August 1485, Henry's army defeated Richard III's army at the Battle of Bosworth Field. When Richard III died in this battle, Henry VII became king. Other people also had a claim on the throne, and Henry did his best to stop them from taking it from him, either by executing them, putting them in prison, or trying to make friends of them, as he did with the Earl of Lincoln. Another step he took was to marry Elizabeth of York, the niece of King Richard III, who would herself have been the heir to the throne if she had not been a girl."
"There were also people who pretended to be long-lost members of the royal family, so that they could try to take the throne. One of these was a little boy called Lambert Simnel, who looked very like Edward, Earl of Warwick. The real Earl of Warwick was Henry's prisoner, but this did not stop other people from believing that Lambert was him. The Earl of Lincoln rebelled against King Henry and raised an army to make Lambert king, thinking that he himself could rule the country. There was a battle, and the Earl of Lincoln was killed. Lambert Simnel was captured, but, because he was only a child, Henry spared his life and he became a royal servant."
"Henry married Elizabeth of York, and by this action put an end to the Wars of the Roses. They had six children, but only four survived infancy:"
Henry VII increased taxes so future kings would have enough money. People disliked that.
Death.
"Henry VII died of tuberculosis in 1509 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. He was succeeded by his son, Henry VIII on 21 April 1509."
"Dover, Kent"
"Dover is a town on the coast in Kent, in the United Kingdom. It was built by the Romans. There is a castle in Dover, called Dover Castle. It is the largest castle in England. The population is about 39,078. Throughout history, it has been an important port of Britain because it is the closest port to mainland Europe. The sea between Dover and the French port of Calais is called the Strait of Dover. It is the narrowest part of the English Channel at only wide."
"The ferry port in Dover has ferries to Calais, France and Ostende, Belgium. Almost 45,000 people and 15,000 vehicles pass through the port every day. On of the largest tourist attractions around Dover are the White Cliffs of Dover."
Dover History.
"The Romans first tried to invade Dover in 55BC, under Julius Caesar. They were forced back by the Celts, who fiercely defended the coastline. It was not until 43 AD, under the rule of Emperor Claudius, that Roman forces landed on British soil at Richborough and took control of the land as far as the northern border. Dover, then called DVBRIS, became the Romans' most important naval town."
Tonbridge
"Random Access Memories had very little electronic music in it. Instead, Daft Punk used live instruments and minimized the use of synthesizers. It is a tribute to the disco, rock and funk music of the 1970s and 1980s."
"The lead single ""Get Lucky"", featuring Pharrell Williams and Nile Rodgers, was met with critical acclaim and topped many charts around the world. At the 2014 Grammy Awards Get Lucky won Record of the Year and RAM won Album of the Year."
"In 2015, a documentary called ""Daft Punk: Unchained"" was released. It told the history of the band from their beginnings in the early 1990s to the 2014 Grammy Awards."
Final projects.
"In 2017, Daft Punk collaborated with The Weeknd in the singles ""Starboy"" and ""I Feel It Coming"". They performed both songs at the 2017 Grammy Awards. It was their final performance together."
"In 2021, they announced their breakup via YouTube."
Paralympic Games
"The Paralympic Games or Paralympics, are a major international sports event. People with physical disabilities compete in these games. They are called Paralympians. They include people with disabilities that affect movement, amputations, blindness, and cerebral palsy."
There are Winter and Summer Paralympic Games. They are held just after the Olympic Games. All Paralympic Games are governed by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC).
History.
The Paralympics started as a small gathering of British World War II veterans in 1948. They became one of the largest international sport events by the early 21st century.
Paralympians.
"Paralympians have many different kinds of disabilities, so there are several categories in which they compete. The disabilities are in six broad categories: amputee, cerebral palsy, intellectual disability, wheelchair, visually impaired, and ""Les Autres"" (This means ""the others"" in French.) These categories are further broken down which vary from sport to sport."
Paralympians work for equal treatment with able-bodied Olympians. Olympians receive much more money than Paralympians. Some Paralympians have also participated in the Olympic Games.
National Basketball Association
The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the world's top men's professional basketball league. It is one of the major professional sports leagues of North America. There are 30 teams in the league. 29 are in the United States and 1 is in Canada. It is a member of USA Basketball (USAB). The NBA is one of the 4 major North American professional sports leagues. NBA players are the world's best paid athletes. They have the highest average annual salary.
"The league was formed in New York City on June 6, 1946. It was called the Basketball Association of America (BAA). The league merged with the National Basketball League (NBL) in 1949. They then were known as the National Basketball Association. The league's head offices are in the Olympic Tower at 645 Fifth Avenue in New York City. Its international offices are in the same place. NBA Entertainment and NBA TV studios are in Atlanta, Georgia."
"The NBA is widely considered the top level of competition in the world for basketball. With an average player height of about 6 foot 6 inches, it is also the world's tallest sports league."
History of the NBA.
Creation and merger.
"In 1946, The Basketball Association of America (BAA) was formed. Its founders were owners of the major ice hockey arenas in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States and Canada. On November 1, 1946, the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers. This was the first game played in NBA history. There were earlier attempts at professional basketball leagues. Examples are the American Basketball League and the NBL. The BAA was the first league to play in major cities. They played in large arenas. The level of play in the BAA was not very good. Competing leagues and other teams had similar talent. The Harlem Globetrotters are an example."
"On August 3, 1949, the BAA combined with the NBL. The National Basketball Association was born. The new league had 17 teams. They came from cities of different sizes. The league got rid of several teams. It reached its smallest size of eight teams in the 1954–55 season. They were the New York Knicks, Boston Celtics, Philadelphia Warriors (now Golden State Warriors), Minneapolis Lakers (now Los Angeles Lakers), Rochester Royals (now Sacramento Kings), Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons (now Detroit Pistons), Milwaukee Hawks (now Atlanta Hawks), and Syracuse Nationals (now Philadelphia 76ers). Teams in small cities moved to larger cities."
"Japanese-American Wataru Misaka broke the NBA color barrier in 1947–48. He played for the New York Knicks. But 1950 is recognized as when the NBA integrated. African Americans joined several teams. Those players included Chuck Cooper, Nathaniel ""Sweetwater"" Clifton, and Earl Lloyd. They joined three different teams. During the 1950s, the Minneapolis Lakers won five NBA Championships. George Mikan was their leader. He played the center position. The Lakers were the league's first dynasty. In 1954, the league introduced the 24-second shot clock. A team must try a shot in 24 seconds. If they cannot, the other team gets the ball."
Teams.
The NBA contains 30 teams. 15 are in the Eastern Conference and 15 are in the Western Conference. Each conference has three divisions with 5 teams. Teams play other teams in their division often. All teams play all other teams in a season.
The Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers have won 17 championships each. No other teams have won more championships. Some teams have never won a championship.
29 teams are in the United States. The Toronto Raptors are in Canada. David Stern wants the league to expand to Europe. Some teams have played games in the United Kingdom.
Regular Season.
"Teams begin training camps in September. This allows the coaching staff to observe their players. Teams play preseason games. These do not count for a team's final season record. The weaker players get cut. Other players stay on the team and get paid. The NBA regular season begins in the last week of October. All teams play 82 games during a normal season. There are 41 home games and 41 road (away) games. Home games offer benefits to teams. They generally play better due to fan support and lack of travel. Teams play every other team during the regular season. The best players play in the NBA All-Star game in February. Fans vote for the starters. The coaches vote for the reserve (substitute) players. There is a pause in the season during the All-Star Game. Teams do not play games for about a week. Other events occur during the All-Star break. These include the Three-Point contest, the Skills course, and the Slam Dunk contest. Players participate in part due to fan interest."
"Before the trade deadline, teams can trade players. This can cause changes in the balance of power. Team bosses want to get the best players for their team. Other bosses want to lower their costs. Trades often happen on the last day."
"The regular season ends in the middle of April. Individual awards are given to players. The Most Valuable Player (MVP) award is given to the player most important to his team. The Defensive Player of the Year award is given to the player who plays the best defense. There are a few other awards. After the 2015-2016 season, Stephen Curry became the first player to win all votes for the MVP award."
Playoffs.
"At the end of every NBA regular season, the NBA Playoffs begin. 8 teams from each, the western, and the eastern conference are assigned a seed 1-8. Home court advantage is always determined by seed; higher seed=home court advantage. In the first round of the playoffs, the 1 seed plays the 8 seed;2 plays 7; 3 plays 6; 4 plays 5. All playoff rounds are best-of-7 series, meaning the first team to win 4 games moves on to the next round. Since 2014 every round follows a 2-2-1-1-1 format. The higher seeded team will have home games 1, 2, 5, and 7. The lower seed is home in games 3, 4, and 6."
NBA Finals.
"To win an NBA championship, a team needs to win four rounds. The fourth round is called the finals. A team from the Eastern Conference plays a team from the Western Conference. The team that wins this series is the NBA champion. The best player in the finals wins the Finals Most Valuable Player award. The finals are played in the same format as the other rounds, 2-2-1-1-1. If both teams are the number 1 seed from their respective divisions, the team with the best record will have home court advantage."
FIFA Women's World Cup
The FIFA Women's World Cup is the most important competition in the sport of Women's association football . The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) organizes the World Cup every four years.
"The most successful team has been the United States, with 3 titles."
Nathula
"Nathula is a mountain pass in the Himalayas. It connects Sikkim in India and Tibet in China. It is at a height of 4,500 metres above sea level."
Klondike Gold Rush
"The Klondike Gold Rush happened in the 1890s when many people went to the Klondike region of the Yukon, in Canada. They hoped to find gold there and become rich. Many of these prospectors came from the United States. Gold was first found in Klondike in a creek called Rabbit Creek. Prospectors named the creek ""Bonanza Creek"" because of the gold (""bonanza ""means a lucky source of wealth). Four million dollars worth of gold was found."
"Going to the gold fields was difficult. Most people who started the journey did not arrive. Very few who arrived found any gold. The city that likely profited most from the Klondike Gold Rush was Dawson City, Yukon in Canada."
Clone High
"Clone High is an animated comedy television show about a high school full of clones of famous dead people. It aired on MTV in the US and Teletoon in Canada. It was produced by Nelvana, Touchstone Pictures, Teletoon Canada, and MTV."
Chinese Civil War
"The Chinese Civil War (Chinese ; 中国内战) (Russian ; Гражданская Война в Китае) was a civil war fought from 1927 to 1949 because of differences in thinking between the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Kuomintang (KMT, or Chinese Nationalist Party). The war was a fight for legitimacy of the government of China. The war began in April 1927 because of the Northern Expedition (國民革命軍北伐) and mostly ended in 1950. Some people say the war has not ended, but no large battles have started since that year. Relations between the Republic of China (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) are still poor because both claim to be the legitimate sovereign government of all of China. The Chinese Civil War was the third-largest war of all time, after World War 1 and World War 2. It was part of the Interwar period in the aftermath of the Great War from 1918 to 1939 and was also part of the Cold War in the aftermath of World War 2 from 1945 to 1949 . The war is usually divided into two parts: 1927-1937 and 1946-1949 . It started and stopped several times before the Second Sino-Japanese War and there was less fighting after the Empire of Japan had invaded. The war between the CCP and the KMT started again in 1946 after Japan's defeat in World War II. The CCP took control of most of China, and the KMT had only islands left. About two million Chinese fled to Taiwan in late 1949. In 1950, no large battles were started. The loss of the KMT in Mainland China is said to be for several reasons:"
"No agreement was made between the two governments and so some say that the war has not ended. Both governments have many military weapons to be used against only against each other, both still say they are the legitimate government of China, and both seek diplomatic relations with other countries as the only legitimate government."
Background and Prelude 1894-1911.
"In 1894 Japan invaded the Qing Dynasty in Manchuria and Taiwan and as well as Korea . In 1899-1901 the Boxer Rebellion happened and Japan invaded China again but allied with Russia, Germany, Austria, France, Britain and America to support Yuan Shikai to stop Empress Dowager Cixi. This led to the fall of the Qing dynasty in the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, the country was thrown into turmoil. In the ensuing power vacuum, a large number of warlords seized control of different parts of the country. To defeat them and unify the country, Sun Yat-sen and his KMT sought help from foreign governments."
"He made pleas to several Western democratic nations, but none offered help cats. It was only after he turned to the Soviets in 1921 that Sun found aid. The communist Soviet Union agreed to help the KMT if the smaller Chinese Communist Party be allowed to join. In 1923 the Soviet Union, the KMT, and the CCP made an agreement, the Sun-Joffe Manifesto, which said the Soviets would help China have only one government. Mikhail Borodin traveled to China in 1923 to help change the KMT to make it similar to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The CCP and KMT were joined in the First United Front."
"In 1923, Chiang Kai-shek travelled to the Soviet Union to study military and politics with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In 1924, he became the leader of the Whampoa Military Academy in China. Most of the help from the Soviet Union was for that school, which taught Soviet political and military ideas to the KMT and the CCP. The Soviets gave books and guns to use for teaching about war and military things. With Soviet help Sun made an ""army of the party"". Members of the CCP were also in the school and some were teachers. Zhou Enlai was a teacher in the school."
"The KMT then agreed to let some communists join the KMT, when the CCP was small compared to the KMT. The CCP had 300 members in 1922 and only 1,500 by 1925. The KMT in 1923, however, had 50,000 members."
The First Chinese Civil War 1927-1936 and the Second Civil War 1945-1949.
In 1927 the civil war in the Republic of China began when the Kuomintang (KMT) became rivals with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and both parties led by Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong were fighting against each other. The Chinese Nationalists got support from the Weimar German Republic and Nazi Germany by buying German Weapons from Europe until the Nazi’s started to support the Japanese Empire in 1937 when the Second Sino-Japanese War began which is the start of World War 2 in Asia .
Nagorno-Karabakh
"Kansas is the 15th-largest state in the United States. It covers an area of 82,282 square miles (213,109 km2). Of this, about 462 square miles (1196.57 km2) are water. This makes up 0.60% of the total area of the state."
"Kansas shares borders with Nebraska to the north, Oklahoma to the south, Missouri to the east, and Colorado to the west. Kansas is just as far away from the Pacific Ocean as it is the Atlantic Ocean. The geographic center of the main 48 states is near Lebanon, Kansas. The geographic center of Kansas is in Barton County."
Geology.
"The underground of Kansas is made of dipping sedimentary rocks, and they are slightly slanted west. A series of Mississippian, Pennsylvanian, and Permian rocks are found in the eastern and southern parts of the state. In the western part of Kansas, Cretaceous can be found sticking up from the ground. This happened because of the erosion from the geologically uplifted Rocky Mountains west of Kansas. Northeastern Kansas was affected by glaciation during the Pleistocene."
Topography.
"All of Kansas is in the Great Plains, where the land is mostly flat with prairies and grasslands. Eastern Kansas has hills and forests, like the Flint Hills and the Osage Plains in the southeastern part of the state."
"Kansas increases in elevation from east to west. The highest place in the state is Mount Sunflower near the Colorado border. Mount Sunflower is 4,039 ft (1,231 m) tall. The lowest point is the Verdigris River in Montgomery County, at 679 ft (207 m) above sea level. It is a common misconception that Kansas is the flattest state – in 2003, a tongue-in-cheek study famously said the state is ""flatter than a pancake"". Kansas has a maximum topographic relief of . This makes Kansas the 23rd flattest U.S. state."
Rivers.
About of the Kansas's northeastern border is the Missouri River. The Kansas River is created by the junction of the Smoky Hill River and Republican River. This happens at Junction City. The Kansas River then joins the Missouri River at Kansas City. It goes across the northeastern part of the state.
The Arkansas River (pronunciation varies) starts in Colorado. It goes for about across the western and southern parts of Kansas.
"Kansas's has other rivers. There is the Saline River and the Solomon River. They are tributaries of the Smoky Hill River. The Big Blue River, the Delaware River, and the Wakarusa River flow into the Kansas River. The Marais des Cygnes River is a tributary of the Missouri River. Spring River is between Riverton and Baxter Springs."
National parks and historic places.
Areas under the protection of the National Park Service include:
Plants and animals.
"In Kansas, there are currently 238 species of rare animals and 400 rare plants. Among those include: ""Boechera laevigata"", Virginia Rail, Cleft Ledge, Royal Fern, Turkey-tangle, Bobolink, Cave Salamander, Peregrine Falcon, and Black-footed ferret. Common animal species and grasses include: Crows, Deer, Lesser Prairie Chicken, Mice, Moles, Opossum, Prairie Dogs, Raccoon, ""Tripsacum dactyloides"", Prairie Dropseed, Indian Grass, Little Bluestem, Switch Grass, Northern Sea Oats, Tussock Sedge, Sideoats Grama, and Big Bluestem."
Weather.
"The Köppen climate classification says that Kansas's climate has three types depending on where in the state it is: it has humid continental, semi-arid steppe, and humid subtropical. The eastern 2/3 of the state (especially the northeastern part) has a humid continental climate. This means it has cool to cold winters and hot, often humid summers. Most of the precipitation happens during both the summer and the spring."
"The western 1/3 of the state – from about U.S. Route 83 to west of it – has a semiarid steppe climate. Summers are hot, often very hot, and generally less humid. Winters vary a lot. Winters can be anything between warm and very cold. The western region gets an average of about of precipitation per year. Chinook winds in the winter can warm western Kansas all the way into the range."
"The far south-central and southeastern parts of Kansas, including the Wichita area, have a humid subtropical climate. This means it has hot and humid summers, and it has milder winters. It also has more precipitation than other places in Kansas. Some things about three climates can be found in most of Kansas. Many parts can get droughts and varied weather. Places can be dry or humid. Places can get both warm or cold in the winter."
"Temperatures in many areas in the western half of Kansas reach or hotter on most days of June, July, and August. Because of the high humidity, the heat index can be deadly, especially in Wichita, Hutchinson, Salina, Russell, Hays, and Great Bend. Temperatures are often high in Dodge City, Garden City, and Liberal, but the heat index in those three cities is usually lower than the actual air temperature."
"Temperatures of or higher are not as common in the eastern half of Kansas. However, higher humidity and the urban heat island effect make most summer days reach between and in Topeka, Lawrence, and the Kansas City metropolitan area. During the summer, the low temperatures each night in the northeastern part of the state don't get colder than very often. Also, because of the humidity being between 85 and 95 percent, dangerous heat can be felt all day."
"Kansas has a varied climate with an average yearly temperature of 56°F (13°C). The highest temperature ever in Kansas is 121 °F (49.4 °C). This happened in Fredonia on July 18, 1936, and in Alton on July 24, 1936. The lowest temperature ever in Kansas is -40 °F (-40 °C). This occurred in Lebanon on February 13, 1905. Kansas is in a temperate area of the country. Like other states in this region, Kansas has four distinct seasons."
"Kansas can have extreme weather in all four seasons. For example, in spring and autumn, Kansas has many tornadoes. In fact, Kansas gets about 55 tornadoes per year. This is because Kansas is in the area known as Tornado Alley, where cold and warm air masses come together to make severe weather."
"In summer, Kansas has experienced severe droughts. For example, in 1934, 1936, and 1939, Kansas had less than average rainfall and widespread dust storms as a part of the Dust Bowl."
"In winter, Kansas has snow in most parts of the state. The average snowfall in the northern half of the state is 16 inches, with the average snowfall in the southern half of the state being 8 inches. Blizzards and related snowstorms are rare in Kansas."
Cities and Counties.
Kansas is organized into 105 counties. Each county has a county seat. There are 627 incorporated cities in Kansas.
"Wichita is the biggest city in Kansas; it has almost 400,000 people. It is in Sedgwick County, which has about 520,000 people. Sedgwick County has the biggest city in Kansas, but it does not have the most people of any county in Kansas; Johnson County has more than 600,000 people. Johnson County has four of the biggest cities in Kansas: Overland Park, Olathe, Shawnee, and Lenexa. They are all suburbs of nearby Kansas City. Topeka is the capital of Kansas. Lawrence is a college town between Kansas City and Topeka."
People.
"Kansas had 627 cities in 2008. The largest city in Kansas is Wichita, which had a population of 382,368 in 2010. The other largest cities in Kansas are: Overland Park, 173,372; Kansas City, 145,786; Topeka, 127,473; and Olathe, 125,872. Between the years of 2000 and 2010, the Kansas population increased 6.1 percent."
Ancestry.
The 2010 Census says that the people of Kansas were:
Producing output.
"Printers are programmed using a programming language. The printer interprets the program, and the outputs the result. There are two big classes of such languages: Page description languages, and Printer Control languages. A page description language describes what a page should look like. The program in a page description language is sent to the printer, which interprets them. Printer command languages are at a lower level than Page description languages, they contain information that is specific to the printer model."
Common programming languages for printers include:
Cost of printers.
"When comparing the cost of a printer, people often talk about how expensive it is to print one page. This cost usually has three components:"
"Printers that are more expensive to buy will usually be less expensive in the consumables (the ink, toner, or ribbon used by the printer). Therefore, laser printers are often more expensive to buy than inkjet printers, but are not as expensive to use over a long period of time. Inkjet printers on the other hand cost more to use because the ink tanks they use are more expensive than the toner for a laser printer."
"Laser printers that can print in color are usually more expensive than those that only print in black and white. Some expensive printers can do other things such as print on both sides of the paper, automatically sort the output, or staple the pages."
Chasing Vermeer
Chasing Vermeer is a children's novel. It is about two children noticing strange coincidences relating to art. The book was written by Blue Balliett and published (printed) by Scholastic in 2003. It says many things about the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer.
"The sequel to the book is ""The Wright 3""."
Great Wall of China
"The Great Wall of China is an ancient wall in China. The wall is made of cement, rocks, bricks, and dirt. It was finished in 1878 and it was meant to protect the north of the empire of China from enemy attacks. It is the longest structure humans have ever built. It is about 21,196 kilometers long, wide and 15 metres high. The earlier sections on the wall are made of compacted dirt and stone. Later in the Ming Dynasty they used bricks. There are 7,000 watch towers, block houses for soldiers and beacons to send smoke signals."
"Nineteen walls have been built that were called the Great Wall of China. The first was built in the 7th century BC. The most famous wall was built between 226–200 BC by the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang (Qin Pronounced as Chin) , during the Qin Dynasty. Not much of this wall remains as people have been stealing from it. It was much farther north than the current wall. The current wall was built during the Ming Dynasty."
History.
Great Wall of Qi was started in 685 BC. The state of Qi made a fortified wall for protection against the Southern states Ju og Lu and later from the kingdom Chu.
The state of Yan built walls during the rule of King Zhao of Yan (311–279 BC).
"The state of Zhao built walls during 325–299 BC, during the rule of king Wuling of Zhao."
"Walls on the periphery of the Northern states Yan, Zhao, and Qin became linked together, because all those states came under the rule of emperor Qin Shi Hong, during his rule (221–206 BC)."
"The First Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang also called Shi Huangdi, started the Qin Dynasty. The Xiongnu tribes in the north of China were his enemies. The land in some parts of China is easy to cross, so Qin Shi Huang started building the Great Wall to make it more difficult for the Xiongnu to invade China."
"By 212 BC, the wall went from Gansu to the coast of South Manchuria."
"Other dynasties in China had worked more on the wall and made it longer. The Han, Sui, Northern and Jin Dynasties all repaired, rebuilt or expanded the Great Wall. During the Ming Dynasty, major rebuilding work took place. Sections of the wall were built with bricks and stone instead of earth. It took more than 2000 years for building and completion of the Great wall."
"The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states. It is the longest structure humans have ever built. It is about 21,196 kilometers long, 9.1 metres (30 feet) wide and 15 metres high. It is made over the course of hundreds of years, the wall was built by over 6 different Chinese dynasties, and is over 2,300 years old."
"The wall was built to help keep out northern invaders like the Mongols. Smaller walls had been built over the years, but the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, decided that he wanted a single giant wall to protect his northern borders. The most well-known sections of the wall were built by Ming Dynasty. Genghis Khan, the founder of the Mongol Empire, was the only one who breached the Great Wall of China in its"
"2,700-year-history."
The Great Wall was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987. The Great Wall was declared as one of the Seven Wonders of the World in 2007.
Construction and rebuilding of the Great Wall.
"Builders used materials that were nearby. Some parts of the wall were made of mud, straw, and twigs. Thousands of workers died from giant falling stones, exhaustion, disease, animal attacks, and starvation. Workers dying and being buried in and under the Great Wall is a myth."
Visibility from space.
"Rumours about astronauts being able to see the Great Wall from the moon are scientifically not proven. The Great Wall has shown up in radar images taken from space, but scientists are sure it is not possible for astronauts to see the wall with a naked eye. One astronaut who spoke about the visibility of the Great Wall from space was Neil Armstrong. He said that on the moon, it was very clear that the wall was not visible. However, astronaut William Pogue was able to see the wall from a Low Earth Orbit distance (300-530 km height), but only with binoculars and with lots of practice."
The Tsar's Bride
"The Tsar's Bride (""Tsarskaya nevesta"" in Russian) is an opera by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. It was the tenth opera the composer wrote. The words (libretto) were written by Il’ya Tyumenev who based the story on a book called “The Tsar’s Bride"" by Lev Mei. The opera was composed in 1898. The first performance took place in 1899 at the Moscow theater of the Private Opera of S.I. Mamontov."
The story of the opera.
"The story is supposed to take place in the autumn of 1572 in Moscow. At this time Russia was ruled by a very cruel tsar called Ivan the Terrible. Tsar Ivan had a group of people who guarded him. They were called oprichniki. The oprichniki were like bodyguards, but they were told to kill anybody who was not loyal to the tsar, so they behaved like terrorists, killing, raping and stealing wherever they went. In the opera there are also “Boyars”. A Boyar was a nobleman."
Act 1: The Feast.
"Griaznoy is an oprichnik. Although he already has a lover, Lubasha, he now decides he loves Marfa, the daughter of the merchant Sobakin. Marfa is already engaged to be married to Lykov, a boyar. There is much merrymaking and singing at a feast. Then Griaznoy asks to be left alone with Bomelius, the tsar’s doctor. He asks him to get him a love potion. Lubasha, who is hiding, hears what he says and realizes that he does not love her any more. When the doctor goes, Griaznoy is horrible to Lubasha and tells her to go. She now wants to talk to Bomelius."
Act 2: The Love Potion.
"A lot of people are coming out of church. They talk about the autumn weather, but when the oprichniki appear they are very frightened and start talking about whom the tsar is going to choose for his bride . Marfa talks to her friend Duniasha about how she has loved Lykov ever since they were children. Tsar Ivan passes by. She does not recognize him, but she is very frightened at the way the Tsar is staring at her. Sobakin comes in with Lykov and the four of them sing about looking forward to the wedding."
Lyubasha now goes to Bomelius and asks for another magic potion which she wants to give to Griaznoi to stop him loving Marfa. Bomelius says he will give her the potion if she will make love to him. Lyubasha agrees and goes inside with him.
Act 3: At the wedding.
At the wedding celebrations Sobakin tells Lykov that he will have to wait before his marriage to Marfa can be confirmed. The Tsar himself is looking for a girl to marry and has asked to see Sobakin’s daughters. Griaznoy realizes he needs to use the love potion quickly so he asks to be invited to the wedding. At the celebration he puts the potion in Marfa’s drink. A messenger comes with the news that the Tsar has chosen Marfa to be his wife. Everyone is horrified and Sobakin collapses.
Act 4: The Bride.
"Sobakin is at the Tsar's palace. He is proud because his daughter is now the Tsarevna (the Tsar’s wife) and he himself has been made a Boyar. But he is also worried because Marfa has become very ill. Griaznoy comes in and greets Sobakin (who are now both boyars). He says that the person who poisoned Marfa has confessed. Marfa rushes in and tells Griaznoi to speak. He says that Lykov was tortured and then confessed to having poisoned Marfa. Lykov was then executed by Griaznoi himself. Marfa goes mad when she hears this. In her madness she thinks Griaznoy is Lykov. This eventually makes Griaznoy confess that he himself at put the potion into her drink. He did not realize it was poisonous. Lyubasha then confesses that she had put her potion in the place of Griaznoi’s potion. She blames Griaznoy and invites him to kill her. He kills her, then he is taken to prison to be executed. As he is taken away, Marfa, in her madness, once again mistakes Griaznoy for Lykov. She invites him to return the next day to visit her. Then she dies."
Bubble sort
"Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. It is simple to understand, so it is usually taught to new students. It is not as efficient as some other sorting algorithms."
"Bubble sort's name comes from the fact that each item in the list “bubbles” up to where it should go, like bubbles in water."
Algorithm.
"The algorithm compares pairs of elements in a list. The elements the make up the pairs are next to each other. Starting at one end of the list, the two elements in each pair are compared to each other in order. That means for example, the first and second element are compared, then the second and third element, and then the third and fourth, and so on. If the elements in the current pair are out of order, then the two elements switch places. This process – of comparing two elements – is done over and over again, until the whole list is sorted. The list is sorted, when there are no more pairs that have to be swapped."
"In the best case scenario, where the list was already sorted before running the algorithm, the algorithm's complexity is O(n) (Big O notation). In the worst case, where the list starts off as being sorted in reverse, O(n²)."
Implementation.
"In an imperative programming language, bubble sort can be implemented by using a flag variable and looping through the array's elements:"
"Alternatively, since the greatest value ascends to the highest index within the first iteration and then has reached its final ""right"" position, two for-loops nested into one another sort the vector, too:"
for top ≔ high(vector)−1 downto low(vector) do
for current ≔ low(vector) to top do
if vector[current] &gt; vector[current+1] then
"exchange(vector, current, current+1)"
Maundy Thursday
"Maundy Thursday, also known as Holy Thursday, Covenant Thursday, Great &amp; Holy Thursday, and Thursday of Mysteries, is the Christian feast or holy day falling on the Thursday before Easter that commemorates the Last Supper of Jesus Christ with the Twelve Apostles as described in the Canonical gospels. It is the fifth day of Holy Week, and is preceded by Holy Wednesday and followed by Good Friday."
Jesus told this parable after he taught his disciples how to pray the Lord's Prayer.
The parable is therefore an incentive to pray. The parable of the Unjust Judge has a similar meaning.
Depictions.
"The most famous depiction of this parable is ""The Importunate Neighbour"" (1895) by William Holman Hunt, kept at the National Gallery of Victoria, Australia."
Onon (river)
"The Onon gol (Mongolian: Онон гол, Russian: Онон) is a river in Mongolia and Russia. It is 818 km long. Its watershed is 94,010 km2. It starts at the Khentii Mountains, on the Eastern slopes. 298 km of the river is in Mongolia. It has a confluence (the place where two rivers join together) with the Ingoda River. When they meet, it makes the Shilka River. People believe that Genghis Khan was born near the upper Onon and he grew up there. The rivers Onon—Shilka—Amur makes one of the world's ten longest rivers (their lengths, in order: 818 km, 560 km, 2,874 km)."
Entscheidungsproblem
"The Entscheidungsproblem (German, ""decision problem"") is a famous problem of mathematics. David Hilbert formulated the problem in 1928: Is there an algorithm that will take a formal language, and a logical statement in that language, and that will output ""True"" or ""False"", depending on the truth value of the statement? The algorithm does not tell how it reaches the answer, nor prove it, as long as the answer is always correct."
"In 1936 and 1937, Alonzo Church and Alan Turing showed independently, that there can be no answer to the Entscheidungsproblem. They showed that it is impossible for an algorithm to decide whether statements in arithmetic are true or false. For this reason, there can be no solution for the Entscheidungsproblem . This was proven by Alan Turings ""Turing Machine"" which was created in the 1930s."
Turing's Proof.
"Turing proposes a computer program that can determine for certain if any program fed into it will halt or not. He also proposes another program that halts if the input is loop, and loops if the input is halt. He says to make these two programs one new program. Then, he proposes to feed this new program's code into itself. This means the program thinks it will halt, so it will loop, but then it'll loop, so it'll halt, and so on and so forth. This is a paradox, which means for certain that you cannot write a program to determine if every program will halt or not."
Bessie Coleman
"Elizabeth ""Bessie"" Coleman (January 26, 1892 – April 30, 1926) was the first female African American pilot ever to hold an international pilot license. She fought discrimination to follow her dream of becoming a pilot. She became a skilled barnstormer and aviation educator."
Early Life.
"Coleman was born in Texas in 1892. Her mother was African American and her father was Native American. She had two brothers and a young sister. Her parents were sharecroppers. When Coleman was two, her family moved to Waxahachie, Texas where Bessie went to school. She loved reading and was very good at math. Her father hoped to get a job."
Coleman’s father was disturbed by the racial barriers in Texas. He believed that the family would be treated better if they moved to Indian Territory in Oklahoma.
"Unable to convince his wife to accompany him, Coleman’s father left the family when she was nine. Around that time, her older brothers grew up and moved away. Coleman’s mother worked as a maid. Coleman helped take care of her younger sisters."
"During the cotton harvest, everyone in the family worked in the fields to earn extra money. It was hot, boring work, and during the harvest, African American children could not go to school. Still, Coleman managed to finish all eight grades in the local school. Coleman decided that she wanted to go to college, so she saved her money. In about four years, she had enough money to begin college. A year later, she ran out of money."
"At the age of 23, Coleman boarded a train and made the trip to Chicago. She moved in with her brothers and their wives. Coleman took class to learn to become a manicurist, and soon found a job at the White Sox Barber Shop on Chicago's Southside. But Coleman wanted to do something more with her life."
Flying.
"Her friend Robert Abbott told her that she could travel to France to fly. She studied the French language after work at night. She got a new job managing a restaurant and saved her money. Robert Abbot and her friends helped her pay for the trip. In 1920, Coleman went to France on a ship. She learned to be a pilot at the Caudron Brothers' School of Aviation. In 1921, Coleman became the first female African American pilot ever to hold an international pilot license. She earned it from the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale."
"Coleman went back to the United States to work as a barnstormer, performing tricks and stunts in her airplane. Barnstormers like Coleman flew planes in loops and figure eights and other patterns while audiences watched. Coleman performed in the United States and Europe. In the 1920s, much of the United States still practiced racial segregation. Coleman refused to perform at places that did not let African Americans watch equally. For one show in Texas, Coleman refused to perform unless the showrunners let everyone in the audience enter through the same gate instead of making one gate for white people and one for black people. She also taught flying lessons and encouraged women to learn to be pilots."
Coleman wanted to open an aviation school in the United States where black students could learn to be pilots.
"In April 1926, Coleman and her mechanic, William Will, were practicing for a performance the next day. Will was piloting the plane, when it flipped over and started to dive. Coleman fell out of the plane and was killed. She is buried in Chicago's Lincoln Cemetery."
Legacy.
Coleman is in the Aviation Hall of Fame.
"In 1929, William Powell started the Bessie Coleman Aero Club in her honor. The Club promoted aviation among black Americans, and it allowed men and women to join."
"In 1995, the U.S. Post Office issued a stamp in her honor. A Chicago street was named after her."
Tony Danza
"Tony Danza (born Anthony Salvatore Iadanza; April 21, 1950 in Brooklyn, New York) is an American actor, producer and boxer. His mother was an immigrant from Sicily; his father was a sanitation worker. Danza made his big screen debut in the 1981 movie Going Ape!. Danza was also the host of the ESPY Awards in 1996 and Miss America in 2002."

John McDouall Stuart
"John McDouall Stuart (7 September 18155 June 1866) is regarded as one of Australia's greatest explorers. He went on seven major exploring trips into the centre and north of Australia. He was leader of six of these expeditions. He spent more time out in the Australian bush exploring the land than any other explorer. On each trip, he was able to go further north and found water sources that helped him with his final long journey. In 1862, he crossed Australia from Adelaide, South Australia, to Van Diemen Gulf in the Northern Territory. He was the first European to cross the continent from north to south and then return again."
"Exploring Australia caused Stuart to become very sick from diseases such as scurvy and beriberi. He pushed himself to the very limits of human endurance. Each trip left him weaker and at the end of his last trip he was unable to walk or ride and had to be carried back. Stuart's discoveries opened up the country for the growth of farming sheep and cattle. His route was used to build the Australian Overland Telegraph Line from Adelaide to Darwin which joined an undersea line from Java. This meant that for the first time, Australians could communicate quickly with the rest of the world. But his personal rewards were small. He was given some land by the government and a small salary from his employers. Stuart died poor in England at the age of 50."
Early life.
"Stuart was born on 7 September 1815, at Dysart, Fife, Scotland. His father, William Stuart, had been a captain in the British Army. His mother was Mary McDouall. They had nine children, John McDouall was the sixth. His parents died when he was ten years old. The children were separated and sent to live with different relatives. Stuart was educated at the Scottish Naval and Military Academy in Edinburgh. He studied to be an engineer and surveyor."
Australia.
"In 1839, Stuart moved to Adelaide, South Australia, and began work as a surveyor. Adelaide had only been settled for two years and was mainly still a tent city. The government needed to have maps so that land could be sold or leased. Stuart worked for three years on the edges of the settled areas, measuring the land and dividing it into farm blocks. He learned skills to live and travel in the Australian bush. He was known as a heavy drinker, often spending days at a time drunk. When a recession hit the South Australian economy, Stuart found himself without a job."
Central Australian Expedition 1844.
"Stuart joined Charles Sturt's Central Australian Expedition to search for an inland sea in August 1844. Sturt was so sure that there was an inland sea in the centre of Australia, that he took a large boat as part of his equipment. Stuart joined the group as a draftsman, who would draw up the maps. He was paid one pound a week, and provided with food. Stuart and James Poole, the second in command, were sent out ahead of the main group to find water. The main group could only travel as fast as their flock of sheep could walk. Stuart and Poole found water at Depot Glen, near the current site of Milparinka."
"In the hot dry climate of summer, the group remained trapped at the waterhole for seven months. Stuart took a small group to find water to the north, west, and east, but found none. Stuart was left behind in charge of the main group at Depot Glen. It was very hot so they dug an underground room to keep cool. All the men became sick from scurvy because of the lack of fresh fruit and vegetables. This caused their gums to become soft and their teeth to fall out. They had headaches, their noses bled, and their skin began to turn black. When Poole died, Stuart was made second in command. He also became the surveyor and did all the mapping as Sturt could not see properly. When it finally rained the group tried to keep going north but were blocked by the sand dunes of the Simpson Desert. They turned south and went back to the Darling River. Stuart took over as leader when Sturt became blind and too ill to lead the group. They arrived back in Adelaide after six weeks hard travelling. Sturt had to be carried in a cart, and Stuart, crippled with scurvy and beriberi, looked like a skeleton."
"It took Stuart nearly a year to recover from the expedition. He wrote in a letter: ""I lost the power of my limbs for ... six months, and was quite unable to do anything for myself for ... twelve months."" For the next few years he was unable to work. The money he had made was spent on doctors and living expenses. In 1849 he moved to near Port Lincoln on the Eyre Peninsula and worked on a farm. He soon found work surveying in the area, and met William Finke and James Chambers. Finke and Chambers were rich men and they paid Stuart to explore for them. They wanted him to find them new farm lands and water, as well as minerals like gold and copper."
"Disgust is an emotion. People feel it when they see, touch, hear, or taste something that they think is nasty or repulsive. It is also caused by scorn. For example, when one finds something dirty or not fit to eat. Levels of disgust vary based on cultural, religious, and personal backgrounds/experiences. Disgust can be deliberate as someone can do something on purpose to create this emotion."
Oven
"Ovens are closed, heated containers which are used for heating, baking, and drying. It is used the most often in cooking and pottery. They provide even, dry heat to all surfaces of food inside them. An indoor oven can have an electric heating element, or be fired by natural gas or coal. Outdoor ovens are often made of brick or clay and are buried in hot coals. An oven which is used for making pottery is called a kiln. An oven used for heating or industrial processes is called a furnace. They are hot inside, and often things come out of them hot."
History.
The people in the settlements of the Indus Valley Civilization were the first to have an oven inside of their mud-brick houses by 3200 B.C.
People who study the history of food give credit to the Greeks for making the baking of bread into an art. A type of oven called Front-loaded bread ovens were created in ancient Greece.
Pot
"A cooking pot is a vessel to cook in. It is often larger than a pan, and will be taller than it is wide."
"Pots are used for boiling liquids, like soups or stew."
Liquid
"A liquid is a form of matter. It is settled between solid and gas. Liquid has an almost-fixed volume, but no set shape."
"Every small force makes a liquid change its shape by flowing. Because of that, gravity makes liquids always take the shape of the container. The molecules that make up the liquid can freely move among themselves."
Fluids that flow slowly have a high viscosity. Some fluids like tar have such a high viscosity that they may seem solid.
"It is difficult to compress a liquid. If a liquid is cooled down until it is colder than a certain temperature, it will become a solid. This temperature is called the melting point or freezing point and is different for every different type of liquid. If a liquid is heated up it becomes a gas. The temperature this happens at is called the boiling point."
"Examples of liquid are water, oils and blood."
"In a liquid, the liquid on the top presses down on the liquid underneath, so at the bottom the pressure, ""p"", is bigger than at the top. The equation for working this out is:"
"where ""z"" is the depth of the point below the surface and ""g"" is how strong gravity is pulling on the liquid. ""ρ"" is a number that tells us how heavy a set amount of the liquid is. We call this the density and it is different for all liquids."

White
"White is the brightest color. White light can be made by putting all the other colors of light on the spectrum together. These other colors are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet."
Meaning of white.
"White is linked with light, goodness, innocence, purity, cleanliness and virginity. It is sometimes thought to be the color of perfection. The opposite of black, white usually has a positive connotation. White can stand for a successful beginning. In heraldry, white depicts faith and purity."
"In advertising, white is linked with coolness and cleanliness because it is the color of snow. You can use white to show simplicity in high-tech products. White is an appropriate color for charitable organizations; angels are usually imagined wearing white clothes. White is associated with hospitals, doctors, and cleanliness, so you can use white to show safety when promoting medical products. White is often linked with low weight, low-fat food, and dairy products."
French Guiana
"French Guiana () is an overseas department and region of France, on the north Atlantic coast of South America. By land area, it is the second largest region of France and the largest overseas department of France and of the European Union."
"Arad, Romania"
"Arad (pronunciation in Romanian: ; Hungarian: ""Arad""; Serbian: Арад, ""Arad"") is the capital city of Arad County, in the western part of Romania, in Crişana, Ardeal. It is found on the Mureş River."
Transsexual
Transsexual people are people who change their appearance to more closely resemble that of the opposite sex. Transsexuals may be male or female. They typically take hormones and often undergo surgeries to support this process. They usually adopt a new name and may legally have their name changed.
People who go from male to female (MTF) are referred to as transsexual women. People who go from female to male (FTM) are referred to as transsexual men.
Ways to go from male to female.
"Transsexual women take female hormones. They may also take drugs that stop male hormones called androgens. Taking estrogen pills makes breasts grow. It does not make beards go away. It does not make voices higher. Transgender women may remove their facial hair so it does not grow back. This takes a long time and hurts. Some transsexual women with low voices have surgery to raise their voices. Other transsexual women try to make their voice sound higher and more female without surgery. Some transsexual women also get surgery on their genitals. This is called a vaginoplasty. This is done by making a vagina from the skin of their penis, which is turned inside out. Some transsexual women also have surgery to make their faces look more feminine. Some also have surgery to make their breasts larger."
Ways to go from female to male.
Transsexual men take male hormones. This will make their voices lower. It will make a beard grow. It can also stop their menstruation. Some transsexual men look like any other man after hormones.
"Some transsexual men have surgery. One surgery is removal of breasts (mastectomy). Some transsexual men also get surgery on their genitals. One surgery is removal of the uterus and ovaries (hysterectomy). Some may also get surgery on their outside genitals. One way takes their skin and tissue and makes it into a penis (phalloplasty). Another way takes the clitoris (which grows bigger with hormones) and puts it where the penis usually is (metoidioplasty). The place where urine comes out (urethra) can be run through the new penis. The phalloplasty looks more like a penis. A metoidioplasty has more sexual function, but it is 5 or 6 centimeters long. Some ways also make a scrotum from the labia. They may also have the vagina taken out or closed."
Detransitioning.
"Very rarely, some people (called ""detransitioners"") who have changed sex decide this was a mistake and return to living as members of the sex in which they were born."
Some of the effects of surgery and hormones can be reversed but others are permanent.
Pianist
A pianist is a person who plays the piano.
"A pianist can play music for piano alone or play together with other musicians in an ensemble or orchestra. Pianists also play along singers, solo musicians, and other performers in their leading performance."
Telephone book
A telephone book or phone book or telephone directory is a book that has lists of telephone numbers of people and businesses. People use phone books to look up the phone numbers of people and places when they need to call them. One example of a telephone book is Yellow Pages.
French dip sandwich
"The French dip sandwich is a popular dish. It is a sandwich, usually on French bread, with roast beef on the inside. It comes with a special sauce called ""jus"" which is usually made with the juice and fat that came off the roast beef when they were cooking it. It was not originally from France; two restaurants in Los Angeles, California, ""Cole's"" and ""Philippe's"", both claim to have invented it."
Coventry
Coventry is a city in England. Coventry is the ninth biggest city in England. It is also a metropolitan borough. It is in the West Midlands county. It used to be in Warwickshire.
"During the 19th century Coventry became a great manufacturing area, especially for bicycles. In the 20th century it made many motor cars. It also made aeroplanes. It was badly bombed in World War II. During the November 1940 bombing, the city's cathedral was destroyed. A new cathedral was built after the war."
The city has two universities. Coventry University is in the city centre. The University of Warwick is in the south of Coventry.
The local football team is Coventry City F.C..
"Coventry was UK City of Culture in 2021. Coventry is located on the Birmingham arm of the West Coast Main Line. There are four railway stations, the main Coventry station and three local stations at Canley, Coventry Arena and Tile Hill."
"The first period of Japan's history is its prehistory, before the written history of Japan. Archeologists have found pottery from that time. Japan’s Paleolithic era covers a period from around 100,000 BC to around 12,000 BC. Archeologists have found some polished tools made of stones. Some of them are kept in Tokyo National Museum. These tools are more than 32,000 years old."
Jomon Period.
"The Jomon period lasted for about 10,000 years, from 10,000 BC to around 300 BC. This was the Mesolithic era for Japan. Some scholars say that during this period, Neolithic culture also developed in Japan."
Archeologists have found several pieces of pottery of that time. Some are clay figures and some are vessels and potteries of different shapes.
Yayoi Period.
"The Yayoi period covered about 550 years, from around 300 BC till around 250. The period's name came from a location in Tokyo."
"By that time, Japanese people had learnt the cultivation of rice, and agriculture became the main part of the Japanese society. Because of this, differences in social status started to occur."
"Different clans controlled different areas and they also fought among themselves. Some Chinese texts tell about this time. These texts describe Japan as Wa. Later, the Yamatai came into being when about 30 smaller parts of Japan of that time united under a queen named Himiko."
Ancient and Classical Japan.
"The Ancient and Classical period covers about 900 years, beginning from the mid-3rd century till the end of the 12th century. Japanese history during this period may further be divided into several smaller periods. These are described below."
Kofun period.
"In the history of Japan, the period from the mid-3rd century until the mid-6th century is known as the Kofun period."
"Kofun is a large tomb made at this era, and people who had social power were buried. Buddhism had not reached Japan by this time. Many kofuns were made in many places. This fact lets us to know that many social groups all around the country made up an authority, and this leads to the Yamato dynasty."
"The Yamato dynasty started to have take more action against Korea and China. In the 4th century, they started to advance to Korea to get iron. By this, cultures and technologies of Korea and China started to be introduced to Japan. They also fought with Goguryeo and Silla, which are countries in Korea. In the 5th century, the five kings of Wa made effort to have relationship with China."
Asuka period.
The second period is called the Asuka period (mid-6th century till around 710). Asuka is the place where the base of Yamato dynasty took place. By this time Buddhism had reached Japan.
"From the end of the 6th century to the early 7th century, Empress Suiko and her nephew Prince Shotoku innovated the political system so that the emperor gets power. They also sent missions to the Sui dynasty."
"The trend of centralization still continues. In 645, the Taika Reforms takes place, and the political system changes a lot."
"In 663, the nation fights with the Tang dynasty and Silla (Battle of Baekgang), but loses."
"In 672, the Jinshin war occurs and Prince Ōama becomes the emperor (Emperor:Tenno天皇). In his era, Japan starts to make a Chinese style law system (Ritsuryo). Also, the word , which means ""Japan"" in Japanese, was started to be used in the era of Tenmu."
Nara Period.
"During this period, from the year 707, steps were taken to shift the capital to Heijō-kyō, a place near present-day Nara. This was completed in 710. A new city was built. The city was built to look like the Chinese capital city of that time. At that time, the Tang Dynasty was ruling China, and the capital was at Chang'an (now Xi'an)."
"During the Nara period, development was slow. The Emperor’s family members were always fighting for power with the Buddhists and other groups. At that time, Japan had friendly relations with Korea and China’s Tang Dynasty. The capital was shifted twice. In 784, the capital was moved to Nagaoka and in 794 to Kyoto."
Heian Period.
"The years from 794 to 1185 are known as the . This grouping of years is named after city of Heian-kyō, which is the early name of present-day Kyoto. The Heian period produced many cultural achievements, such as the Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu."
"The power of the Japanese imperial court (that is, the Emperor, his ministers and other important persons) rose. This period is also famous for its art, poetry and literature. Japanese culture also became Japanese way.The language used in this period was called Late Old Japanese. The writing systems known as Kana emerged at this time. By the end of this period (that is, by the end of the 12th century), a number of groups came into being. These groups were highly armed and they fought among themselves. The situation was like a civil war, that is, war among different sections of society. Finally, groups of people called Samurai led society under the political rule of a Shogun. The Heian Period ended due to the Genpei War."
Feudal Japan.
"The period from around the 12th century through the 19th century is called feudal period in the history of Japan. The Japanese Emperor was the head of the government, but he had no real power. Many powerful families (called daimyo and military groups called shogun) ruled Japan during this period. The feudal period of Japan is generally sub-divided into different periods named after the shogunate which ruled during that period."
Kamakura Period.
"The years 1185 to 1333 are known as the . This grouping of years is named after city of Kamakura which was the center of power of the Kamakura shogunate. Minamoto no Yoritomo was the founder and first shogun of the Kamakura shogunate. The period is named after the government of Kamakura Shogunate. In this period, Mongols tried to invade Japan between the years 1272 and 1281. Japanese were successful at driving away the Mongols. But, this badly affected Japan. Shogunate also became weak and its rule ended in 1333. For a short time, Go Daigo became the emperor of Japan."
Muromachi Period.
The Muromachi Period began in 1336 and ended in 1573. Emperor Go-Daigo lost his throne. The government of the Ashikaga shogunate took control of most parts of Japan. This period ended in 1573. In that year the 15th and the last shogun named Ashikaga Yoshiaki was forced to leave the capital Kyōto.

"One of the systems is the ""apostrophus"", in which D is written as IƆ (500) and M is written as CIƆ (1,000). In this system, an extra Ɔ means 500, and multiple extra Ɔs are used to mean 5,000, 50,000 etc."
Vinculum.
"Another system is the ""vinculum"", in which V, X, L, C, D and M are multiplied by 1,000 by adding an overline."
Map
"A map is an image of an area, usually of the Earth or part of the Earth. A map is different from an aerial photograph because it includes interpretation. Many maps are called ""charts"" such as star charts and nautical charts. Some maps are of distant worlds. Before the late 20th century almost all maps were on paper. Today, many maps are digital, and can be seen on smartphones and computers. However, paper maps are still used."
"The word ""map"" can also be used to talk about a chart or drawing that shows relationships between ideas, people, events, or anything else you can think about. This is why web developers call a list of web pages on a web site a site map."
People who make maps are cartographers.
Many maps today are made using GIS computer systems. These are database systems that are organized by location instead of named records.
"If a map is on a piece of paper or a computer screen, it has to be projected. This is because the Earth is round and paper and screens are flat. There are a lot of ways that use mathematics to make map projections. The only kind of map of the Earth that is not projected is one drawn on a sphere. This is called a globe."
Globe
"A globe is a scale model with the shape of a sphere. Globes can be scale models of the Earth (""terrestrial globes"") or of other planets. Globes can also be models of the celestial sphere (""celestial globes""). The English word ""globe"" comes from the , meaning round mass or sphere."
Most globes are maps of the Earth. They have the advantage of avoiding the distortions of flat map projections. The most common types are political and physical. Political globes show countries. Physical globes show landscape like mountains and rivers. Some globes are star charts and some are maps of distant worlds.
"Global as an adjective is used to mean the entire world rather than any special place on the Earth. It is also used in fields like computers to mean dealing with a whole larger system, rather than its individual little parts."
History.
"That the Earth is a sphere was established by Hellenistic astronomy in the 3rd century BC. The terrestrial globe appeared in that period. Now, there are no terrestrial globes from Classical Antiquity or the Middle Ages in existence. The first example of terrestrial globe known was the one the ancient Greek Crates of Mallus made in the middle of the 2nd century BC. The Greek geographer Strabo wrote about Crates's terrestrial globe during the early years of the Roman Empire."
"A celestial globe from Classical Antiquity is in the Naples National Archaeological Museum, Italy. The globe is part of a sculpture – the globe is held up by a statue of Atlas, a Titan from Greek mythology. The ancient Romans made the globe and statue in the 2nd century AD. They may have copied the sculpture from Hellenistic art (art of the ancient Greek type) from the Hellenistic period (the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd centuries BC). The sculpture's name is the ""Farnese Atlas""."
"Early globes of the Earth that show all of the Old World were constructed in the Islamic Golden Age. One such example was made in the 9th century AD by Muslim geographers and cartographers working under the Abbasid caliph, al-Ma'mun. Another example was the globe introduced to Beijing by the Persian astronomer, Jamal ad-Din, in 1267."
"Martin Behaim designed a globe in 1492, in Nuremberg, Bavaria (Germany). Georg Glockendon was the artist who created the actual map drawings following Behaim's specifications. This globe is the oldest terrestrial globe still in existence. A copy of the globe showing America was made by Martin Waldseemueller in 1507. Another early globe, the Hunt-Lenox Globe, ca. 1507, is thought to be the source of the phrase ""Here be dragons"". Another ""remarkably modern-looking"" globe of the Earth was made in Constantinople (Istanbul) by Taqi al-Din at his Constantinople Observatory during the 1570s."
Manufacture.
"Mass-produced globes are typically covered by a printed paper map. The most common type has long, thin gores (strips) of paper. These strips narrow to a point at the North Pole and the South Pole. Then a small disk is used to paper over the irregularities at the poles. The more gores there are, the less stretching and crumpling is needed to make the paper map fit the sphere."
"From a geometric point of view, all points on a sphere are the same. One could select any point on the planet, and create a paper map that covers the globe with strips that come together at that point and the opposite point."
"Many of George Gershwin's songs were first written for musical plays performed in theaters in New York City. These comedies, with plenty of songs, were a popular form of entertainment in the 1920s and 1930s."
"One of Gershwin's musical plays, ""Girl Crazy,"" introduced a young singer named Ethel Merman. She became one of the most celebrated performers in America. In the play, Merman sang a song George Gershwin wrote just for her. It was called ""I Got Rhythm""."
"Many songs that George Gershwin wrote for musical plays and movies have remained as popular as ever. Over the years, they have been sung and played in every possible way—from jazz to country."
"One example is the song, ""Someone to Watch Over Me."" It was written for the 1926 musical ""Oh, Kay!"""
Jazz and his music.
"In the nineteen twenties, there was a debate in the United States about jazz music. Could jazz, some people asked, be considered serious music?"
"In 1924, jazz musician and orchestra leader Paul Whiteman decided to organize a special concert to show that jazz was serious music. Gershwin agreed to compose something for the concert before he realized how little time he had to do it. The concert was just a few weeks away. Gershwin got busy, and, in that short time, he composed a piece for piano and orchestra. He called it ""Rhapsody in Blue."""
"Gershwin himself played the piano part of ""Rhapsody in Blue"" at the concert. The audience included some of the greatest classical musicians of the time. When they heard his music, they were electrified. It seemed to capture, for the first time, the true voice of modern American culture. Today, we can still hear Gershwin playing ""Rhapsody in Blue."" An old mechanical piano recording Gershwin created has been reproduced exactly. There are also very early versions of ""Rhapsody in Blue"" which feature Gershwin playing the piano with Whiteman's orchestra. Those recordings, because they are early, do not sound like modern recordings. But they are recordings of Gershwin at the piano. This makes those recordings important."
"""Rhapsody in Blue"" made George Gershwin famous all over the world. Several hundred thousand copies of the printed music sold immediately. Gershwin was satisfied that he had shown that jazz music could be both serious and popular."
Musical works and opera.
"Gershwin also wrote an opera, ""Porgy and Bess. "" It was based on a book by DuBose Heyward. It is a tragic love story about black Americans along the coast of South Carolina."
"""Porgy And Bess"" opened in Boston, Massachusetts in 1935. Audiences loved it. But most critics did not know what to think of it. It was not like any other opera or musical play they had ever seen."
"Gershwin did not care about the critics' opinions. He believed some of his greatest music had gone into the opera. He said he had created a new musical form—an opera based on popular culture. Today ""Porgy And Bess"" is considered a masterpiece."
"Another well-known Gershwin piece is ""An American in Paris. "" It is a long tone poem for orchestra. Its first public performance was by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in 1928."
"Once again, opinion was mixed. Most people loved ""An American in Paris,"" as they loved all of Gershwin's music. Some critics liked it, too. They called it happy and full of life. Others hated it. They called it silly and long-winded."
Last days.
"George Gershwin died in 1937, just days after doctors learned he had brain cancer. He died while having surgery to remove the brain tumor. He was only thirty-eight years old. Newspapers all over the world reported his death on their front pages. Everyone mourned the loss of the man and all the music he might have written. Gershwin is still considered one of America's greatest composers. His works still are performed by many singers and groups. They are probably performed more often than any other serious American composer."
"Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg was one of the people who praised George Gershwin. Schoenberg said Gershwin was a man who lived in music and expressed everything through music, because music was his native language."
Aaron Copland
"Aaron Copland (, ; November 14, 1900December 2, 1990) was an American composer who wrote modern music."
"Aaron Copland wrote many kinds of music. He wrote music for the orchestra, piano, and voice. He wrote music for plays, movies, and dance. Copland also was a conductor, pianist, speaker, teacher, and writer."
Music critics say Copland taught Americans about themselves through his music. He used parts of many old American folksongs in his work. He wanted to do this after studying music in France. He said that composers there had a very French way of writing music. He said Americans had nothing like that in this country. So he decided to compose music that was truly American.
Early days of Copland.
"Aaron Copland was born November 14, 1900 in Brooklyn, New York. He died at the age of 90 on December 2, 1990. He was the youngest of five children. His parents had come to the United States from eastern Europe. They owned a store in Brooklyn. Aaron began playing the piano when he was a young child. He wrote his first song for his mother when he was eight years old. His dreams of becoming a composer began when he was young. When he was sixteen, he asked his parents to let him study composing with Rubin Goldmark. Goldmark had taught the composer George Gershwin."
"When he was in his early twenties, Copland went to Paris, France, where he studied music with Nadia Boulanger. She was one of the most important music teachers of the time. He returned to New York in 1924."
Known classical works.
"The famous conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Serge Koussevitzky, learned about Copland's music. Koussevitzky led the orchestra for the first performance of Copland's early work, ""Music for the Theater"", in 1925. Koussevitzky also conducted Copland's ""Concerto for Piano and Orchestra"" in 1927. This work was unusual because Copland used ideas from jazz music in his concerto."
"Copland later wrote the music for two ballets about the American West. One was about the life of a famous gunfighter called Billy the Kid. Copland used music from American cowboy songs in this work. This piece from ""Billy the Kid: Ballet Suite"" is called ""Street in a Frontier Town""."
"In 1942, the conductor Andre Kostelanitz asked Copland to write music about a great American, Abraham Lincoln. Copland wrote ""Lincoln Portrait"" to honor America's 16th president. Copland's music included parts of American folk songs and songs popular during the American Civil War. He added words from President Lincoln's speeches and letters."
"""Lincoln Portrait"" has been performed many times in America. Many famous people have done the speaking part.Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was one of them. Here, actor James Earl Jones performs in Copland's ""Lincoln Portrait."""
"In 1942 the music director of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra asked 18 composers to write music expressing love for America. For the competition, Copland composed ""Fanfare for the Common Man. "" This music is played in America during many national events, including some presidential inaugurations (when they become presidents)."
Ferret
"Ferrets (""Mustela putorius furo"") are domestic animals. They are the domestic form of the European polecat. They are in the weasel genus of the family Mustelidae."
"Ferrets have an average length of 20 inches (51 cm) including a 5-inch (13 cm) tail, weigh about . They live for about 7–10 years. Males are larger than females. They are sociable animals, and are usually kept in groups of two or more."
"With their long thin body, ferrets look like a large weasel. They may have different colours and markings on their fur. A lot of ferrets in one place will sometimes have a strange smell. This is caused by natural oils produced by the ferrets."
Behavior.
"As naturally crepuscular animals, ferrets tend to sleep during the day. This deters many people from getting them although most ferret owners say their ferrets change their sleeping schedules to that of their owners."
Ferrets and humans.
"Domesticated ferrets are used for hunting, or can be kept as pets. Hunting with ferrets is called ferreting. Because of their thin body, they can go down into holes and hunt rodents and rabbits. Ferrets have been kept as pets since the Middle Ages."
Health.
"Ferrets suffer from several health problems. Some of the most common health problems are cancers affecting the adrenal glands, pancreas, and lymphatic system. Viral diseases include canine distemper and influenza. Health problems can happen in unspayed females when not being used for breeding. Certain colors of ferret may also carry a genetic defect known as Waardenburg syndrome. Similar to domestic cats, ferrets can also suffer from hairballs and dental problems"
Ferrets as pets.
Ferrets are legal to have as a pet in most places. They are not legal in a few places in the United States. Ferrets should be vaccinated. A breeder or pet store will get it spayed or neutered and also de-scented. Ferrets can spray the natural oils from their anal glands similar to that of a skunk if not de-scented.
Ferrets are very flexible and can fit into small holes to flush out rabbits or rodents. Ferrets can get through open vents or small holes in walls. Ferrets are good climbers so if curtains are touching the floor they can easily climb the curtains.
"Ferrets should be kept in a group, unless you can provide them with multiple hours of activity, they get quite bored when alone. Ferrets tend to sleep curled up together in a ball usually making them indistinguishable from one another."
Diet.
Ferrets are carnivores and cannot tolerate grains or vegetable matter well. Their diet should consist of around 20% fat and 80% meat. Ferrets need a high calorie diet: commercial dog and cat foods do not contain enough fats and protein to suit them. Feeding them such a diet while convenient will ultimately shorten the ferrets life.
"Ferrets are subject to insulinoma and as such they should not be given fruits except on rare occasions as a treat. Raisins are a favorite of most ferret but should be given extremely sparingly. Fresh chicken, turkey or even duck is a good choice for your ferret. Commercial ferret foods are available but many contain grains and also fruits and as such are not suitable for them. Research brand ingredients or find a recipe to make your own."
Three Dog Night
Three Dog Night is an American rock band. They were popular from the late 1960s and early 1970s. They had 21 hit singles and 12 gold albums between 1969 and 1975.
Grand Funk Railroad
"Grand Funk Railroad were an American rock group from Flint, Michigan. They were popular in the early and mid 1970s."
The Sweet
"The Sweet (also known as Sweet) are a British glam rock band. The group is famous for the songs such as ""Ballroom Blitz"", ""Little Willy"", ""Fox on the Run"" and ""Love is Like Oxygen"". The group was originally called Sweetshop."
Prince (musician)
"Prince Rogers Nelson (better known as Prince) (June 7, 1958 – April 21, 2016) was an American musician and dancer. He was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota."
"He was known for blending erotic lyrics with funk rock and technology. He had ten platinum albums and thirty Top 40 singles during his career. His releases have sold over 350 million copies worldwide. From 1993 to 2000, Prince changed his name to a glyph. Since this symbol was impossible to pronounce, people began calling him ""The Artist Formerly Known As Prince."""
"In addition to his own musical career, he was a ""talent promoter"" for the careers of Sheila E., Carmen Electra, The Time and Vanity 6."
"Throughout modern times, the largest known prime number has very often been a Mersenne prime. Most sources restrict the term ""Mersenne number"" to where ""n"" is prime, as all Mersenne primes must be of this form as seen below."
"Mersenne primes have a close connection to perfect numbers, which are numbers equal to the sum of their proper divisors. Historically, the study of Mersenne primes was motivated by this connection; in the 4th century BC Euclid demonstrated that if ""M"" is a Mersenne prime then ""M""(""M""+1)/2 is a perfect number. In the 18th century, Leonhard Euler proved that all even perfect numbers have this form. No odd perfect numbers are known, and it is suspected that none exist (If it exist, it would have to be greater than 101500)."
"It is currently unknown if there is an infinite number of Mersenne primes. Most mathematicians who have studied the question think there are an infinite number of Mersenne primes. Carl Pomerance, Samuel S. Wagstaff Jr. and Hendrik Lenstra developed a formula which they think should say about how many Mersenne primes there are under a given number."
"The binary representation of 2""n"" - 1 is ""n"" repetitions of the digit 1."
"For example, 2""5"" - 1 = 11111 in binary."
"The first four Mersenne primes were known by the Ancient Greeks. They are 3, 7, 31 and 127. The next, 8191, was discovered in 1456. Some people like trying to find big primes. Since there are tricks and algorithms to finding Mersenne primes quickly, the largest known primes are also Mersenne primes."
"As of December 21, 2018, 51 Mersenne primes have been found. The largest known prime is a Mersenne prime, formula_1."
Super Monkey Ball
"Super Monkey Ball is a platform video game. It was developed by Amusement Vision and published by Sega. It was first released in Japan in January 2001 as an arcade game titled ""Monkey Ball"". It had a joystick in the shape of a banana. It was later released worldwide as a launch title for the Nintendo GameCube. Titled ""Super Monkey Ball"", it was released in Japan on September 4, 2001, in North America on November 18, 2001, and in Europe on May 3, 2002."
Gameplay.
"""Super Monkey Ball"" has three modes of gameplay: Main game, party games and mini-games."
Main game.
"In the main game, the object is to guide a monkey in a hamster ball across a series of platforms in the air and through a goal at the end of the level. Four monkeys are available for the player to play as. Each level is timed; with a level running for either 30 or 60 seconds. The player controls the main game with the GameCube controller's control stick. By moving the stick, the whole level moves, and the ball rolls in the direction that the level moves. Each level has bananas that the player can collect. Bananas give the player points, and collecting a certain amount of them gives the player an extra life. Should the player fall off of the level or the timer reaches zero, the player loses a life. There are three main difficulties: Beginner, Advanced and Expert. Beginner is ten easy levels, Advanced is 30 non-easy levels, and Expert is 50 harder levels. Should the player meet a certain condition after completing a difficulty, they will be able to play the difficulty's ""extra"" levels. A fourth difficulty level, Master, can be unlocked by completing the Expert and Expert Extra levels without using a continue. Master is the hardest difficulty level, with ten levels."
Party games.
"There are three party games: Monkey Race, Monkey Target and Monkey Fight. In Monkey Race, players race on one of several racing levels, competing for the best rank. In Monkey Target, players roll their monkey down a ramp and open the monkey's ball to fly in order to land on one of several islands. Three levels are available to play on. In Monkey Fight, players punch other monkeys for points. When time runs out, whichever monkey has the most points wins."
Mini-games.
"There are three minigames that can to be unlocked with points gotten in the main game: Monkey Bowling, Monkey Billiards and Monkey Golf. Each minigame is based on the real life sport."
Prudence Crandall
"Prudence Crandall (September 3, 1803 – January 28, 1890) was an American teacher. She was born on September 3, 1803 to Quakers. She went to the New England Friends’ Boarding School in Providence, Rhode Island. In October 1831, she opened a private girls’ school in Canterbury, Connecticut. In 1833, an African American girl was admitted to the school. The parents of the white girls in the school wanted the black girl expelled. Crandall refused. She opened a school for African American girls in April 1833."
"The Connecticut legislature passed the ""Black Law"". This law made it illegal to open a school that taught African American pupils from a state other than Connecticut. Crandall was arrested, tried, and convicted of violating this law. She was put in jail. A higher court reversed the decision. Crandall was freed, but neighbors harassed her. They smashed the windows in the school. Crandall feared for the students’ safety. She closed the school in 1834."
"Crandall married Baptist minister and abolitionist Calvin Philleo. In 1835, the couple and his three children left Connecticut for Philleo’s farm in New York State. They later moved to Illinois. Here Crandall ran a school from her home. She also took part in women’s rights activities. When Philleo died in 1874, Prudence moved to Kansas to live with her brother. In 1886, the Connecticut legislature gave her a pension. Crandall died on January 28, 1890. She was buried in Kansas. Her old school house in Canterbury is now the Prudence Crandall Museum. In 1995, Crandall was named Connecticut's state heroine."
Nicko McBrain
"Michael Henry ""Nicko"" McBrain (born 5 June 1952) is an English heavy metal musician. He is the drummer of the heavy metal band Iron Maiden."
"During his early year, McBrain played for a few small pub bands and paid his bills with session work he did when he left school. He has also played in Streetwalkers, Trust and with Pat Travers. He joined Iron Maiden in 1982 and debuted on their fourth studio album, ""Piece of Mind""."
He currently uses Premier drums and Paiste cymbals. He converted to Christianity in 1999 after he had an experience in the Spanish River Church.
Kataklysm
"Kataklysm are a Canadian death metal band from Montreal, Quebec."
"Kataklysm was formed in 1991. The band released their debut studio album ""Sorcery"" on February 10, 1995 and their second full-length album on June 26, 1996. Lead singer Sylvain Houde left the band afterwards and Maurizio Iacono took over the lead vocals. Stephane Barbe was also recruited to the band during this time. Their third album ""Victims of this Fallen World"" which was released on March 7, 1998, saw a change in musical style from Kataklysm's previous albums. They returned to their former style when they released ""The Prophecy (Stigmata of the Immaculate)"" but it was less chaotic and with a little bit of thrash metal."
"The busiest railway station in the world is Shinjuku Station in Tokyo, Japan. The largest station is Nagoya Station in Nagoya, Japan. The busiest station in Europe is Clapham Junction in south London in the United Kingdom. At peak times, there is one train every 13 seconds there."
Station facilities.
"Railway stations usually have either ticket booths, or ticket machines. Ticket sales can also be together with an information desk or a shop. Many stations have a shop or a kiosk."
"Bigger stations often have fast-food or restaurants. In some countries these stations also have a bar, or a pub. Other station facilities are: toilets, luggage rooms, lost-and-found (lost property office), timetables, trolleys, waiting rooms, taxi ranks and bus stops."
Railway track
"A railway track or railway line is a set of two parallel rows of long pieces of steel. They are used by trains to transport people and things from one place to another. (In America, people say railroad as well as railway). Often, there is more than one set of tracks on the railway line. For example, trains go east on one track and west on the other one."
"The rails are supported by cross pieces set at regular intervals (called sleepers or ties), which spread the high pressure load imposed by the train wheels into the ground. They also maintain the rails at a fixed distance apart (called the gauge). Ties are usually made from either wood or concrete. These often rest on ballast, which is a name for very small pieces of broken up rock that are packed together and keep the railway tracks in place. Tracks are often made better by ballast tampers."
"The upper surfaces of the rails are inclined slightly towards each other, typically on a slope of 1/20, and the rims of the train wheels are angled in the same way (""coning""). This helps guide the vehicles of the train along the track. Each wheel also has a flange, which sticks out from one edge all the way around. This makes sure the train does not ""derail"" (come off the track) and helps guide the train on sharp curves."
Rail transport
"Rail transport is the movement of passengers and goods using wheeled vehicles called trains, made to run on railway tracks. In most countries, this transportation method helps trade and economic growth. Railways (UK) or railroads (North America) provide an energy-efficient way to transport material over land. The railway tracks are a large part of the system and provide smooth and hard surfaces on which the wheels of the train roll with a little friction. Also, the track spreads the weight of the train which means larger amounts can be carried than with trucks and roads."
Rail transport started to be important in the Industrial Revolution. The first railroads were built in England.
Waterway
"A waterway is any body of water that can be used for transportation by people in boats. These include rivers, lakes, oceans, and canals."
"They must be wide and deep enough for the boats, and either have no waterfalls and rapids, or have ways for boats to get around them, such as locks."
Terminus
"Terminus is a Latin word that literally means ""Boundary stone"" but can refer to:"
Junction
"A junction is any place where linear things, especially roads and railway tracks, meet."
A Road junction is a place where roads meet. These are known as 'T' junctions and 'X' junctions.
Railway junction.
A railway junction is a place where two railway tracks join. The shape of a junction looks like
Sometimes the trains just cross and keep going straight ahead to their destination. Sometimes they turn onto the other track to reach the planned destination. Moveable portions of track make this possible.
Station
"Station has many meanings, so it is often used with other words to tell people which one is meant:"
In transport:
In communications:
The hottest temperature ever in Mandalay was . The coldest temperature ever was .
Mandalay in writing.
There are some important books and poems that talk about Mandalay. Some of these are famous.
"Rudyard Kipling wrote a poem called ""Mandalay."" He wrote it in 1890. This poem has a famous saying in it: ""on the road to Mandalay."""
"In 1907, Oley Speaks wrote a song using the words of the poem. He called the song ""On the Road to Mandalay."" The song is very famous. Frank Sinatra sang the song and called it ""Come Fly with Me""."
"George Orwell wrote a novel called ""Burmese Days"". He wrote it in 1934. Orwell was part of the Indian Imperial Police. He was stationed in Mandalay. The novel is about his experiences (what he did and saw.) He also wrote some non-fiction essays and short stories. Some of these are ""A Hanging"" (1931) and ""Shooting an Elephant"" (1936)."
Twin towns.
Mandalay has three twin towns:
Act of Congress
"An Act of Congress is a statute enacted by the United States Congress according to the powers granted to it by the Constitution of the United States. The term can be used in other countries with a legislature called a ""Congress,"" such as the Congress of the Philippines. But most often the term is associated with the United States Congress. In the US, there are several steps from a bill or resolution becoming a law. It must first be passed by a majority of both of the houses of Congress. Then the bill or resolution is sent to get signed by the President. It becomes an Act of Congress by either the president's signature or, if the President does not return the bill or resolution within ten days."
Bills.
"Senators and Representatives create thousands of written proposals each year for new laws. Called bills, only a few few ever make it all the way through the process to become a law. The Constitution requires only three steps: passing the House, passing the Senate and approval by the President. The actual process has become much more complicated."
"A bill may be proposed by anyone but only a member of Congress, called the bill's sponsor, may introduce them on the floor of one of the houses of Congress. A bill may be introduced in both the Senate and House at the same time. In theory, this saves time over sending it though one house, then the other. In each house of Congress, a bill is sent to a committee. A committee studies the bill and recommends changes. If a committee does nothing, the bill is considered ""dead"". A committee may also add other unrelated provisions to a bill called amendments. Committees usually divide themselves into smaller groups called subcommittees. The bill's sponsors then try to convince the subcommittees to approve the bill. They do this through hearings. If the bill passes through a committee it is sent to the floor for debate and a vote. A bill may either be passed by be defeated. If passed, it is sent to the other house of Congress to follow the same procedures."
Resolutions.
"In addition to bills, Congress also passes Acts of Congress called resolutions. There are three kinds: simple resolutions, joint resolutions and concurrent resolutions."
Simple resolutions.
"These are resolutions concerning the operation of either house of Congress. They are not sent to the President for his approval. Resolutions by the House of Representatives which affect that house are designated ""H.Res."" followed by a number. Simple resolutions in the Senate are designated ""S. Res."" followed by a number."
Joint resolutions.
"A joint resolution may start either in the House or Senate. They are essentially the same as a bill. The only difference is a joint resolution that proposes an amendment to the US Constitution. They require a two-thirds majority vote in each house. Like a simple resolution, they are not sent to the President for his signature. They become effective when they are ratified by three-quarters of the states. A joint resolution that began in the House of Representatives is designated ""H.J.Res."" followed by the number. A joint resolution started in the Senate is designated ""S.J.Res."", followed by the number. Joint resolutions become law the same as bills."
Concurrent resolutions.
"Concurrent resolutions start with either ""S.Con.Res."" (Senate) or ""H.Con.Res."" (House). They are numbered consecutively as they are introduced. Concurrent resolutions are those that affect the operations of both the House and Senate. They can also be used to create a temporary joint committee. Concurrent resolutions are not sent to the president for his signature and do not have the force of law."
Jeff Weaver (political staffer)
"Jeffrey ""Jeff"" P. Weaver (born 1966) is an American political adviser. He was the campaign manager for the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign in 2016. Weaver served as the campaign manager during Bernie Sanders' successful Senate run in 2006. Weaver also served as chief of staff in Sanders’ House and Senate offices."
"Weaver was born in St. Albans, Vermont. He studied at Boston University, the University of Vermont, and Georgetown University."
Asta Nielsen
"Asta Nielsen (11 September 1881 – 24 May 1972) was a Danish silent movie actress. She was very popular in the 1910s. She was one of the first international movie stars. Nielsen was in 74 movies. 70 were in Germany where she was known simply as ""Die Asta"" (""The Asta""). She had large dark eyes, a face like a mask and a figure like a boy. Nielsen most often played strong and passionate women trapped by tragic lives. Her performances were erotic so Nielsen's movies were heavily censored in the United States. Therefore, she was not very famous there. Nielsen started her own movie studio in Berlin in the 1920s. She went back to Denmark in 1937 after Nazism became a problem. Later in life, Nielsen became a collage artist and an author."
F. Lee Bailey
"Francis Lee Bailey Jr., commonly referred to as F. Lee Bailey, (June 10, 1933 – June 3, 2021) was an American criminal-defense lawyer. Bailey was born in Waltham, Massachusetts. He worked in Massachusetts and Florida."
"Since the ovules are protected by carpels, it takes something special for fertilisation to happen. Angiosperms have pollen grains made of just three cells. One cell drills down through the integuments, to make a passage for the two sperm cells to flow down. The megagametophyte is a tiny haploid female plant which includes the egg. It has just seven cells. Of these, one is the egg cell; it fuses with a sperm cell, forming the zygote. Another cell joins with the other sperm, and forms a nutrient-rich endosperm. The other cells take auxiliary roles. This process of ""double fertilisation"" is unique, and is common to all angiosperms."
Evolution of flowers.
"Flowers are modified leaves. They are only present in flowering plants (angiosperms), which are relatively late to appear in the fossil record."
"Early fossils of flowers and flowering plants are known from 130 million years ago, in the Lower Cretaceous. However, flowers had a much longer history, the extent of which is not yet fully known. There were flowers from the early Jurassic, 50 million years earlier than was previously thought."
"The flowering plants were thought to have evolved from within the gymnosperms. However, the known gymnosperms are a clade which is distinct from the angiosperms. Apparently, the two clades diverged (split) some 300 million years ago. That is about the boundary of the Carboniferous period with the Permian period."
Uses of flowers.
As decoration.
"Flowers have long been admired and used by humans. Most people think that flowers are beautiful. Many people also love flowers for their fragrances (scents). People enjoy seeing flowers growing in gardens. People also enjoy growing flowers in their backyards, outside their homes. People often wear flowers on their clothes or give flowers as a gift during special occasions, holidays, or rituals, such as the birth of a new baby (or a Christening), at weddings (marriages), at funerals (when a person dies). People often buy flowers from businesses called florists."
As a name.
"Some parents name their children, most often girls, after a flower. Some common flower names are: Rose, Lily, Daisy, Holly, Hyacinth, Jasmine, Blossom."
As food.
"People eat some types of flowers. Flower vegetables include broccoli, cauliflower and artichoke. The most expensive spice, saffron, comes from the crocus flower. Other flower spices are cloves and capers. Hops flowers are used to flavor beer. Dandelion can be made into wine."
"Honey is flower nectar that has been collected and processed by bees. Honey is often named by the type of flower that the bees are using (for example, clover honey). Some people put flowers from nasturtiums, chrysanthemums, or carnations in their food. Flowers can also be made into tea. Dried flowers, such as chrysanthemum, rose, and jasmine, can be used to make tea."
Special meanings.
"Flowers were used to signal meanings in the time when social meetings between men and women was difficult. Lilies made people think of life. Red roses made people think of love, beauty, and passion. In Britain, Australia and Canada, poppies are worn on special holidays as a mark of respect for those who served and died in wars. Daisies made people think of children and innocence."

Square kilometre
"A square kilometer (sometimes written ""km²"") is based on the SI unit of measurement of area, the ""square meter"". It is the area inside a square that has each side equal to 1 kilometer (1000 meters). This way of talking about area is often used to say how much land there is, on a farm or in a city, for example."
One square kilometer is just less than 0.39 square miles.
Judge
A judge is a person who is in control of a court of law.
"The way to become a judge depends on each country. In some countries, judges must work with the law (often as a lawyer) for a number of years before they can ""sit as a judge"" in a courthouse. Judges are supposed to conduct the trial in an open courtroom and impartially."
"In many English speaking countries, judges cannot make some decisions on their own. In these countries, juries are used, but not for all cases. The modern jury trial first developed in mid-12th century England during the reign of Henry II. Today, the details differ between one country and another."
"If there is a jury, the judge has the job of making sure the person taken to court is treated in a fair way. Some courts will have more than one judge. For important decisions about the laws of a country, countries may have a ""supreme court"" or ""high court"" with many (nine or more) judges in it. In the United States, judges on a supreme court are called ""justices"" and are led by a ""Chief Justice""."
"In many countries, judges wear special clothes while being in court. Often this is a black robe or cloak. Supreme or High Court judges often wear a red cloak. Judges in some countries also wear a special long wig. They also used to put a piece of black material on their head when they sentenced a person to die."
Vincent van Gogh
"Vincent Willem van Gogh (30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch post-impressionist painter. His work had a great influence on modern art because of its striking colours and emotional power. He suffered from delusions and fits of mental illness. When he was 37, he died by committing suicide."
"When he was a young man, Van Gogh worked for a company of art dealers. He traveled between The Hague, London and Paris. After that, he taught in England. He then wanted to become a pastor and spread the Gospel, and from 1879 he worked as a missionary in a mining place in Belgium. He began drawing the people there, and in 1885, he painted his first important work, ""The Potato Eaters"". He usually painted in dark colors at this time. In March 1886, he moved to Paris and found out about the French impressionists. Later, he moved to the south of France, and the colors in his art became brighter. His special style of art was developed and later fully grown during the time he stayed in Arles in 1888."
Early life.
"He was born Vincent Willem van Gogh on 30 March 1853 in Groot-Zundert, Netherlands. His father, Theodorus van Gogh, was a pastor. His mother, Anna Cornelia Carbentus, was an artist. Van Gogh was brought up in a religious and cultured family. He was very emotional and he did not have a great deal of self-confidence. He was also a replacement child. He was born a year after the death of his brother, also named Vincent. He even had the same birthday. Living at the church rectory Vincent walked past the grave of his dead brother every day. There has been speculation that van Gogh suffered later psychological trauma as a result, but this cannot be proved."
Career.
"Between 1860 and 1880, when he finally decided to become an artist, van Gogh had two sad romances. He also had worked unsuccessfully in a bookstore, as an art salesman, and a preacher. He remained in Belgium, where he had preached, to study art. The works of his early Dutch period are sad, sharp, and one of the most famous pictures from here is ""The Potato Eaters"", painted in 1885. In that year, van Gogh went to Antwerp where he found the works of famous artists and bought a lot of Japanese prints."
"In 1886 he went to Paris to join his brother Theo, who was the manager of Goupil's gallery. In Paris, van Gogh studied with Cormon. He also met Pissarro, Monet, and Gauguin. This helped the colors of his paintings lighten and be painted in short strokes from the paintbrush. His nervous temper made him a difficult companion and night-long discussions combined with painting all day made him very unhealthy. He decided to go south to Arles where he hoped his friends would join him and help found a school of art. Gauguin did join him, but it did not help. Near the end of 1888, Gauguin left Arles. Van Gogh followed him with an open razor, but was stopped by Gauguin. Instead, he cut his own ear lobe off. After that, van Gogh began to get fits of madness and was sent to the asylum in Saint-Remy for medical treatment. He painted over 1,000 portraits."
Death.
"In May 1890, he regained his health and went to live in Auvers-sur-Oise. However, two months later on 27 July, he shot himself in the chest with a revolver. He died two days later, with Theo at his side. Theo reported his last words as ""La tristesse durera toujours"", which meant, ""The sadness will last forever"" in French."
Legacy.
"During his brief career he had only sold one painting. After his death, Van Gogh's finest works were all sold in less than three years. His mother threw away a lot of his paintings during his life and even after his death. But she lived long enough to see him become a world famous painter. He was not well known when he was alive, and most people did not appreciate his art. But he became very famous after his death. Today, many people consider him to be one of the greatest painters in history and an important influence on modern art. Van Gogh did not begin painting until he was almost 30. Most of his famous works were done in his last two years. He made more than 2,000 artworks, with 900 paintings and 1,100 drawings and sketches. Today, many of his pieces portraits, landscapes and sunflowers are some of the most famous and costly works of art in the world."
Rainbow
"A rainbow is an arc of colour in the sky that can be seen when the sun shines through falling rain. The pattern of colours, called a spectrum, starts with red on the outside and changes through orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet on the inside. Sometimes a second, larger, dimmer rainbow is seen."
"A rainbow is created when white light is bent (refracted) while entering a droplet of water, split into separate colours, and reflected back. A rainbow is actually round like a circle. On the ground, the bottom part is hidden, but in the sky, like from a flying airplane, it can be seen as a circle around the point opposite the Sun."
"Rainbows often appear after storms, and are popular symbols for peace in many cultures."
Cause.
The rainbow effect can be seen when there are water drops in the air and the sun is giving light at the back of the observer at a low distance up or angle.
Rainbows always appear opposite the Sun: they form circles around the shadow of your head (which is the point opposite the Sun).
"While sunlight is white, all white light is actually a blend of many different colours. Water and other materials bend the different colours at different angles, some more strongly than others. This is called dispersion. By splitting up white light into its separate colours, rainbows appear colourful even though the source of light hitting them is white."
The rainbow displays with the deepest effect in our minds take place when:
Another common place to see the rainbow effect is near waterfalls. Parts of rainbows can be seen some of the time:
An unnatural rainbow effect can also be made by spraying drops of water into the air on a sunny day.
The seven colours of the rainbow.
"The rainbow has no definite number of physical colours, but seven are traditionally listed. Below is a commonly used list of seven colors in the order seen in a rainbow. Computer screens cannot show them precisely but can make colors that look similar. (Each color shows the number codes used to tell a computer how to display the color.)"
The gray rainbows.
"&lt;li style = ""background-color: #755496;""&gt; Violet-gray"
"(Hex: #755496) (RGB: 117, 84, 150)&lt;li&gt;"
Central Intelligence Agency
"The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is part of the US federal government and is located at the George Bush Center for Intelligence in Langley, Virginia. The agency was formed in 1947 after World War II. Many of the people who started the CIA had been in the Office of Strategic Services, the main American spy agency during the war. General John K. Singlaub was one of the people who created the CIA."
Types of retaining wall are:
Main type of walls.
"Load Bearing Wall is a structural element. It carries the weight of a house from the roof and upper floors, all the way to the foundation. It supports structural members like beams, slab and walls on above floors."
Non-Load Bearing Wall doesn't help the structure to stand up and holds up only itself. It doesn't support floor roof loads above. It is a framed structure. Most are interior walls whose purpose is to divide the structure into rooms.
"Partition Wall separates spaces from buildings. It can be solid, constructed from brick or stone. It is a framed construction. The partition wall is secured to the floor, ceiling, and walls. It is enough strong to carry its own load. It resists impact. It is stable and strong to support wall fixtures. The partition wall works as a sound barrier and it is fire resistant."
"Cavity Wall A cavity wall or hollow wall consists of two separate walls, called leaves or skins, with a cavity or gap in-between. The two leaves of the cavity wall may be of equal thickness if it a non-load-bearing wall or the internal leaf may be thicker than the external leaf, to meet the structural requirements."
Veneered Wall holds up the material. It can be made of brick or stone. The most famous veneered wall is made of brick. The wall is only one wythe thick. It became the norm when building codes began to require insulation in interior walls. It is light weighted. Veneered walls can be built quickly.
Coordinated Universal Time
"Coordinated Universal Time (or UTC) is the standard time system of the world. It is the standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. It is, within about 1 second, mean solar time at 0° longitude."
"The standard before was Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). UTC and GMT are almost the same. In fact, there is no practical difference which would be noticed by ordinary people."
"Some websites, for example Wikipedia, use UTC because it does not make any country look more important than the others. It offers one time for all the Internet (the same time can be used by people all over the world)."
"Time zones are often named by how many hours they are different from UTC time. For example, UTC−5 (United States east coast) is 5 hours behind UTC. If the time is 07:00 UTC, the local time is 02:00 in New York (UTC−5) and 10:00 in Moscow (UTC+3)."
07:00 UTC is also written more simply as 0700Z (or 07:00Z).
"Note that UTC uses the 24-hour clock. That means there is no 'AM' or 'PM'. For example, 4:00PM would be 16:00 or 1600. UTC also does not use daylight savings time - that way the time stays consistent the entire year."
"When this page loaded, it was , , in UTC."
Television
"A television set (also known as a television receiver or televisor or simply a television, TV set, TV receiver or TV) is a machine with a screen or set of lenses. Televisions receive broadcasting signals and change them into pictures and sound. The word ""television"" comes from the words tele (Greek for ""far away"") and vision (""sight"")."
Sometimes a television can look like a box. Older TVs had a large cathode ray tube in a large wooden frame and sat on the floor like furniture. Newer TVs are much lighter and flatter.
A TV can show pictures from many television networks. Computers and mobile devices also can be used for watching television programs.
"The television was invented in the 1920s but the equipment was expensive and the pictures were poor. By the 1950s, these problems had been fixed and TVs became widespread."
"At first, all televisions used an antenna (or aerial). This would pick up television programmes from broadcasting stations. A TV station could be many miles or kilometers away, and still be received. TVs can also show movies from VCD and DVD players or VCRs. Cable TV and Satellite television can provide more programs at once than broadcast can. Video game consoles connect to most modern TVs. Some computers can also use a TV as a computer monitor."
"All TVs have screens where the picture is viewed. Before the 1950s these were usually ""black and white"", which made everything look grey, but all modern TVs show colors. Most 20th century screens also had rounded corners. That is because television screens were cathode ray tubes. These are like heavy glass jars with one side bulging out to form the screen."
"Today flat panel displays are the usual kind. These are usually flat rectangles with straight edges. This long rectangle looks more like the shape of a movie theatre screen. This is called widescreen. If a widescreen set was 30 cm tall, it would be 53 cm wide. For this to work best, TV shows also need to be made in widescreen. Widescreen sets can still be any size, but they have the same widescreen shape."
The early 21st century is also when digital television transmission became more common than analog television.
Sociology
"Sociology is the study of societies and how humans act in groups. Sociology is a social science. People who study sociology are called sociologists. A society is the community of people living in a particular country or region and having shared customs, laws, and organizations."
"Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès in 1780 was first to use the term. The problems caused by the change to an industrial society, where many people moved to cities and worked in factories, were an early focus of sociology. Auguste Comte, Max Weber and Émile Durkheim were leading figures in the study of social phenomena. Themes included: community, authority, status, alienation and lack of power."
"In the 2000s, some sociologists look at such things as: race, ethnicity, class, gender, the family and social interaction. They also study the breakdown of social structures; crime and divorce."
Work of sociologists.
"Argon is gotten industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid air. About 700,000 tonnes of argon are produced worldwide every year."
"40Ar is made by the decay of 40K with a half-life of 1.25 billion years by electron capture or positron emission. Because of this, it is used in knowing how old rocks are."
Uses.
"Argon is often used when welding steel and similar work, to push away the air around the weld, so the oxygen in the air can't join with the metal being welded. It can also be used in neon lights for a purple color. Argon is used in the poultry industry to asphyxiate birds. Argon is sometimes used for extinguishing (ending) fires."
"Liquid argon is used in neutrino experiments and looking for dark matter. Argon is used to preserve food. Argon is sometimes used as the propellant in aerosol cans. Argon is also used as a preservative for such products as varnish, polyurethane, and paint. Argon has been used by athletes as a doping agent and has been banned as use. It is used to know how old rocks are."
Trade
"To trade is to willingly give things or services and get other things or services in return. For example, a person giving a thing must find another person who wants to get that thing. The giver gets something back in return. A trade is sometimes also called an ""exchange"" or a ""swap""."
An early type of trade is barter. Barter was the exchange of goods and services for other goods and services. Barter involves trading things without using of money. Modern traders commonly buy and sell by the use of money. Trade between two traders is called bilateral trade. Trade between more than two traders is called multilateral trade.
Terms.
The things that are given from one person to the other are called goods.
"Services can also be part of a trade. One person can do a job or work for another, and get something in return in a trade."
"Money can be given in return for a service or for a thing. If money is part of the trade, then the person who gives the money is buying, and the person who gets the money is selling."
A place where trading takes place is called a market.
"When there is no money involved in the trade, the trade is called barter. If there is money involved in the trade, the trade is called a purchase. In the past people would barter to get what they wanted, instead of buying goods and services."
Economics includes the study of trade.
"Trade occurs not just between people, but also between large companies and even countries. Governments sometimes take some of the money or goods involved trade between countries. This is a type of tax called a tariff. Smugglers try to trade without paying tariffs."
"Free trade between two countries is when there are small or no tariffs, quotas, or other restrictions on trade. When one country stops all trade with another country, it is called an embargo."
Types of trade.
Domestic trade.
Domestic trade is the exchange of goods within a country. Domestic trade is very important because it allows different types of goods to reach to all parts of the country. It makes the standard of living of the people of the country better. It helps an industry to grow by making sure that there are raw materials. Domestic trade may be divided into two. They are:
Wholesale.
"Wholesaling is the sale of goods to industrial, commercial, institutional or other professional businesses. They can also be sold to other wholesalers. It is the sale of goods to anyone that is not a consumer. Wholesalers usually buy and sort goods in large numbers."
Retail.
"Retail is the process of selling goods or services to consumers through many means of distribution to earn a profit. The term ""retailer"" usually means where a person sells a small amount of good to many individuals, who are consumers."
International trade.
"International trade is the exchange of goods and services between different countries. International trade has existed throughout history. Some examples include Uttarapatha, Silk Road, Amber Road, scramble for Africa, Atlantic slave trade, and salt roads. When there is trade between two or more countries, factors like currency, government policies, economy, judicial system, laws, and markets affect trade."
International trade may be split up into three different types.
Import.
An import is a good or service that was bought in one country but was produced in another country.
Export.
An export is a good or service that was produced in one country but was sold to another country.
Individual identity.
"A lifestyle is a way of living or doing things. Lifestyle is doing things, living your life and making decisions in your own unique way. Lifestyle can be political, social, economical and personal way of seeing, doing and understanding things. Not all parts of a lifestyle are our decisions. Surrounding social and technical systems, like economical situation and people around us, can limit the lifestyle choices available to the individual."
The Pallbearer
The Pallbearer is an American romantic comedy released in 1996 directed by Matt Reeves. It stars Toni Collette and Gwyneth Paltrow. The story is about suicide and romance conflict. It received almost $6 million in the box office.
Barbara Bates
"Barbara Bates (August 6, 1925 – March 18, 1969) was an American actress. She acted mostly in movies. She played Phoebe in the 1950 movie ""All about Eve"" and acted in many other movies in her career. She was born in Denver, Colorado. She killed herself with carbon monoxide poisoning, also in Denver. She was age 43."
Seven Bridges of Königsberg
The Seven Bridges of Königsberg is a historically famous problem in mathematics. Leonhard Euler solved the problem in 1735. This led to the beginning of graph theory. This then led to the development of topology.
"The city of Königsberg in Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia) was set on both sides of the Pregel River. It included two large islands which were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges."
The problem was to find a way to walk through the city by crossing each bridge once and only once. The islands could not be reached by any route other than the bridges. Every bridge must have been crossed completely every time. The walk need not start and end at the same spot. Euler proved that the problem has no solution.
Euler's analysis.
"First, Euler pointed out that the choice of route inside each land mass does not matter. The only important property of a route is the order in which the bridges are crossed. So, he changed the problem to abstract terms. This laid the foundations of graph theory. He removed all features except the list of land masses and the bridges connecting them. In the language of graph theory, he replaced each land mass with an abstract ""vertex"" or node. Then he replaced each bridge with an abstract connection, an ""edge"". An edge (road) recorded which two vertices (land masses) were connected. In this way, he formed a graph."
→
"The graph drawn is an abstract picture of the problem. So, the edges can be joined in any way. Only whether two points are connected or not are important. Changing the picture of the graph does not change the graph itself."
"Next, Euler observed that (except at the endpoints of the walk), whenever one enters a vertex by a bridge, one leaves the vertex by a bridge. In any walk of the graph, the number of times one enters a vertex equals the number of times one leaves it. If every bridge has been crossed exactly once, it follows that, for each land mass (except for the ones chosen for the start and finish), the number of bridges touching that land mass must be ""even"". This is because if there are n bridges, it is crossed exactly 2n times. However, all four of the land masses in the original problem are touched by an ""odd"" number of bridges (one is touched by 5 bridges, and each of the other three are touched by 3). There are at most two masses which can be the endpoints of a walk. So the proposition of a walk crossing each bridge once leads to a contradiction."
"In modern language, Euler shows that whether a walk through a graph crossing each edge once is possible or not depends on the degrees of the nodes. The degree of a node is the number of edges touching it. Euler shows that a necessary condition for the walk is that the graph be connected and have exactly zero or two nodes of odd degree. This result stated by Euler was later proved by Carl Hierholzer. Such a walk is now called an ""Eulerian path"" or ""Euler walk"". If there are nodes of odd degree, then any Eulerian path will start at one of them and end at the other. Since the graph representing the historical Königsberg has four nodes of odd degree, it cannot have an Eulerian path."
"Euler's work was presented to the St. Petersburg Academy on August 26, 1735. It was published as ""Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis"" (The solution of a problem relating to the geometry of position) in the journal ""Commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae"" in 1741. It is available in English in The World of Mathematics."
Importance in the history of mathematics.
"In the history of mathematics, Euler's solution of the Königsberg bridge problem is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory. Graph Theory is a subject now generally regarded as a branch of combinatorics."
Present state of the bridges.
"Two of the seven original bridges were destroyed during the bombing of Königsberg in World War II. Two others were later demolished. They were replaced by a modern highway. The three other bridges remain, although only two of them are from Euler's time (one was rebuilt in 1935). Thus, as of 2000, there were five bridges in Kaliningrad."
"In terms of graph theory, two of the nodes now have degree 2, and the other two have degree 3. Therefore, an Eulerian path is now possible, but since it must begin on one island and end on the other, it is impractical for tourists."

San (river)
San is a river in southeastern Poland. It is 443.3 km long.
"Pollyanna is an orphan. She arrives in the town of Harrington to live with her rich Aunt Polly. The girl is a happy youngster who believes in the goodness of life. She makes many friends. Aunt Polly controls the town because she is the richest citizen. The people of Harrington want an old orphanage rebuilt. Aunt Polly opposes the idea. The people defy Aunt Polly and plan a bazaar to raise funds for a new building. Aunt Polly is furious. She forbids Pollyanna to participate. On the evening of the bazaar however, Pollyanna slips away and has a wonderful time. She returns home. She tries to avoid her Aunt by climbing a tree outside her bedroom window. She falls and injures her legs. Her cheerful spirits sink, making recovery doubtful. The people of Harrington learn of Pollyanna's accident. They visit her and assure her that she is loved. Pollyanna's spirits return to their usual cheerfulness. She leaves for Baltimore with Aunt Polly to have an operation on her legs."
Tropaeolum
"Tropaeolum is a genus of roughly 80 species of annual and perennial herbaceous flowering plants and the only genus in the family Tropaeolaceae. The genus ""Tropaeolum"" is native in Central America and South America. The roots of the specie T. polyphyllum from Chile can survive underground when air temperatures drop as low as -15°C (5°F)."
Yun Hyu
"Yun Hyu (Korean:윤휴, 尹鑴, October 14, 1617–May 20, 1680) was a Neo-Confucian scholar, politician, and soldier during the Korean Joseon Dynasty. His other names were Baegho (백호, 白湖) and Haheon (하헌, 夏軒). His Chinese style names were Du'goe (두괴, 斗魁) and Huijung (희중, 希仲). He was a middle-ranking member of the North Man party."
The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)
"The Sleeping Beauty is a ballet in a prologue and three acts. Marius Petipa and Ivan Vsevolozhsky wrote the story of the ballet. It was based on Charles Perrault's 1697 fairy tale ""The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood"". Tchaikovsky wrote the music. Marius Petipa designed the dances. ""The Sleeping Beauty"" was first presented at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia, on 15 January 1890. Carlotta Brianza danced the Princess and Pavel Gerdt the Prince, with Marie Petipa as the Lilac Fairy and Enrico Cecchetti as Carabosse. It was first presented in Europe in a shortened version by the Ballets Russes in London on 2 November 1921. Catherine Littlefield designed the first complete ""Sleeping Beauty"" in the United States, and presented the production on 12 February 1937 at the Academy of Music, Philadelphia, with the Philadelphia Ballet."
Background.
"About ten years after Tchaikovsky's ""Swan Lake"" was presented for the first time, Tchaikovsky was asked to write a ballet for the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg. The ballet would be based on Charles Perrault's fairy tale ""The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood"". Tchaikovsky was very happy this story had been chosen. It was set in the age of Louis XIV. He would have the chance to write music in the Baroque style."
"Petipa gave Tchaikovsky very special directions about tempi, meter, and other musical matters. He even specified the length of particular pieces in exact numbers of bars. He asked for a Waltz in Act 1, a Mazurka in Act 2, and a Polonaise in Act 3. The ballet is tied together (and its drama and suspense heightened) through the repeated use of the two musical themes representing good and evil, personified by the Lilac Fairy and Carabosse respectively. Petipa's specifications stimulated Tchaikovsky's imagination, rather than hindered it as one might expect."
"Tchaikovsky's interest in setting the tale reaches back to 1867. It was then that he wrote a little ballet on the story for the children of his sister Alexandra Davydova. He had done the same for ""Swan Lake"". In November 1888, he had a conference with theater officials and Petipa. A draft of the scenario was drawn up. Petipa provided Tchaikovsky with a detailed analysis of the musical requirements. The composer set to work, and finished the score on 1 September 1889."
Story.
Prologue.
"A brief overture contrasts the themes of the malicious Carabosse and the benevolent Lilac Fairy. When the curtain rises, the court assembles for Princess Aurora's christening. Six fairies present their gifts. Carabosse, a fairy overlooked by the master of ceremonies, enters. She curses Aurora. The Princess shall die on her 16th birthday, she says, after pricking her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel. The remaining seventh fairy the Lilac Fairy comes forward. She cannot put the curse to rest, but she can soften it. The Princess shall not die, she commands, but sleep one hundred years. At the end of that term, a Prince will awaken her with true love's kiss."
Act 1.
"Sixteen years after the christening of Princess Aurora, the court assembles in the palace gardens to celebrate Aurora's birthday. Villagers dance a waltz. Aurora dances an adagio with four noble suitors. Carabosse enters unnoticed and slips Aurora a spindle. The Princess pricks her finger on the spindle. She falls to the ground, sound asleep. The Princess is carried into the palace by the noble suitors. The Lilac Fairy puts the entire court to sleep, then causes a dense forest of trees and thorns to surround the castle."
Act 2.
"""Scene 1."" ""The Prince's hunt. A woodland glade with a river in the background."" The stage is empty. Hunting horns are heard. Prince Desire, his tutor Galifron, and his friends enter. They have paused in the hunt to take refreshments. Several dances are performed by various ladies of the court. The hunt is resumed. The Prince is tired so chooses to remain alone in the forest. Here, he meets the Lilac Fairy who emerges from a boat of mother of pearl on the river. She has chosen him as the prince to awaken princess Aurora, and presents various visions of the princess to him. He quickly falls in love with her from the visions and begs the Lilac Fairy to lead him to her. The Lilac Fairy guides him through the forest until they reach the enchanted castle where Aurora rests."
"""Scene 2."" ""Sleeping Beauty's castle."" The Sleeping Beauty lies on a canopied bed. The King and Queen sleep in armchairs nearby. The courtiers and pages sleep standing up and leaning upon one another. Dust and cobwebs cover everything. The Lilac Fairy and the Prince enter. He tries to rouse the Princess and the court, but without success. The Lilac Fairy stands aside without interfering. The Prince kisses the Princess. She awakens. The dust and cobwebs disappear. The court awakens. The King grants the marriage of the Prince and Princess."
Act 3.
"""The Wedding of Prince Désiré and Princess Aurora on the esplanade of King Florestan's palace."""
"The court assembles to celebrate the marriage of Prince Désiré and Princess Aurora. The King and Queen make their entrances with the newlyweds. The festivities begin with a series of ""divertissements"". The Diamond, Gold, Silver, and Sapphire Fairies dance. Several fairy tale characters dance: Puss in Boots and the White Cat; the Bluebird and Princess Florine; Little Red Riding Hood and the Wolf; Cinderella and Prince Fortuné; and finally Hop o' My Thumb with his brothers and the ogre. The Prince and Princess dance a ""pas de deux"". Roman, Persian, Indian, American, and Turkish characters dance a Sarabande. The act ends with a ""tableau vivant"" representing the Glory of the Fairies. This ""tableau"" was changed to represent the Glory of Apollo."
Human settlement
"In archaeology, geography, and history, a human settlement is a place where people live, either permanently (all the time) or temporarily (only some of the time). When people go to an area to live there, it is called settling an area. When they come from far away it is sometimes called a colony. The term may include hamlets, suburbs, towns and cities. Nomadic people do not settle."
Microtia
"Microtia meaning 'small ear' is a deformation of the outer ear. Over 90% of the time, only one ear is affected, but both ears can be affected. More boys are affected than girls. The right ear is more affected than the left. One in 1000 people have microtia. It can affect hearing. There are four grades of microtia:"
"Grade III is most common, and can be corrected by surgery."
"His son Brian and daughter Lisa are the co-chairs and co-CEOs of the company. His daughter Cheryl is the president of the foundation. Steve Whitmire, a veteran member of the Muppet puppeteering crew, plays the roles of Kermit the Frog and Ernie, the most famous characters formerly played by Jim Henson."
"One of Henson's last projects is a show attraction in Walt Disney World and Disneyland. It is called Muppet*Vision 3D. It opened in 1991, shortly after his death."
Game Boy Advance Video
"Game Boy Advance Video is a format of cartridges for the Game Boy Advance. They work the same as normal cartridge but play television shows instead of games. They generally contain 45 minutes of TV, for example, a show from Nickelodeon or Cartoon Network. They were first made in early 2004, but gradually stopped being made shortly before there were no more Game Boy Advance games made in 2008, with the final game for it being Samurai Deeper KYO."
Butterfly
"A butterfly is a usually day-flying insect of the order Lepidoptera. They are grouped together in the suborder Rhopalocera. Butterflies are closely related to moths, from which they evolved. The earliest discovered fossil moth dates to 200 million years ago."
"The life of butterflies is closely connected to flowering plants, which their larvae (caterpillars) feed on, and their adults feed and lay their eggs on. They have a long-lasting history of co-evolution with flowering plants. Many of the details of plant anatomy are related to their pollinators, and vice versa. The other notable features of butterflies are their extraordinary range of colours and patterns, and their wings. These are discussed below."
"Angiosperms (flowering plants) evolved in the Lower Cretaceous, but did not become common until the Upper Cretaceous. Butterflies were the last major group of insects to appear on the planet. They evolved from moths in the latest Cretaceous or the earliest Cainozoic. The earliest known butterfly fossils date to the mid Eocene epoch, between 40 and 50 million years ago."
"Like moths, butterflies have four wings covered with tiny scales. When a butterfly is not flying, its wings are usually folded over its back. The wings are patterned and are often brightly coloured. There are many different kinds of butterflies. The males and females of each kind are often slightly different from each other. Butterfly watching is a popular hobby. Some people also keep collections of dead butterflies that they have caught."
"Like all insects with complete metamorphosis, a butterfly's life goes through four distinct stages. It begins as an egg, which hatches into a larva (a caterpillar). After some time, the larva turns into a chrysalis. While it is in the chrysalis stage, it changes to become an adult butterfly. To complete the cycle, adults mate and the females lay the eggs."
"Butterflies are any of the species belonging to the superfamilies Papilionoidea and Hedyloidea. Butterflies, along with the moths and the skippers, make up the insect order Lepidoptera. Butterflies are nearly worldwide in their distribution."
Predators and defences.
Predators.
"The main predators of butterflies are birds, just as the main predators of the crepuscular moths are bats. Also monkeys and tree-dwelling reptiles are predators, and some insects and spiders. All reptiles and monkeys have good colour vision, so that butterfly coloration works just as well on them as it does on birds."
Defences.
The extraordinary colours and patterns on the wings and body can only be understood in terms of their function. Some of the most obvious functions of colour are:
"The details vary from group to group, and from species to species. The caterpillars also have colours with similar functions. The poisonous substances which make some butterflies noxious to eat are got from the plants eaten by their caterpillars."
Body.
"Like most insects, butterflies have three main body parts. These parts are the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. The body is protected by the exoskeleton. The body is made up of sections, known as segments. In between the segments there are flexible areas that allow the butterfly to move. All three parts of the body are covered in very small scales. The scales give the butterfly its colour."
Wings and flight.
Butterflies have a very characteristic flying style. They usually do not fly in straight lines. Their style is well described by the children's version of their name: 'flutter-by'. The way they fly presumably makes them harder for birds to catch.
"Some species are capable of strong, long flights (see monarch butterfly migration) and others never leave the woods they were born in. They can survive bird pecks on the wings. Late in the season damage to their wings can often be seen, though they continue flying quite well."
"When they are alive, it is often difficult to see they have four wings. The wings on each side are linked by a row of little hooks. So in practice they fly as if they had one large wing on each side."
Head.
"The head is the first part of the body. It has the eyes, mouth parts, and antennae."
"The eyes of a butterfly are large. Like other adult insects, the eye is made up of many small lenses or ""optical units"". these are compound eyes. Butterflies do not see as many colours as humans, but they can see ultraviolet light."
"The mouth of an adult butterfly does not have jaws. It has a kind of mouth that sucks liquids. This mouth is made of two hollow tubes. The tubes are locked together in the middle. When the butterfly is not drinking, the tubes are coiled up. It can uncoil them when it wants to drink. Like all insects, the adult phase is about reproduction. The main eating phase is done by the larvae, which usually eat plant food."
"The antennae of a butterfly are used for smell and balance. The antenna in most butterflies is clubbed at the end. In some butterflies (like the skippers), there is a hook at the end of the antenna, instead of a club."
Thorax.
The thorax is the second part of the body. It is made up of three segments. The legs and wings are connected to the thorax.
Act I.
"Jaquino is a prison guard. He wants to marry Marzelline, the daughter of Rocco who is the warden of the prison. But Marzelline has just fallen in love with someone she thinks is a man called Fidelio. Actually Fidelio is a woman who has dressed up as a man so that she can get into the prison where her husband Florestan is a prisoner (he has been arrested for political reasons). She is pretending to return Marzelline’s love so that she can find a way of rescuing Florestan. Rocco says he is happy for Marzelline to marry Fidelio. Fidelio (Leonore) says she will help Rocco with his job of looking after the prisoners. Rocco says she can do this, but there is one prisoner she is not allowed to guard. He has been locked up alone for two years. Leonore thinks it may be her husband, but she is not sure."
"Don Pizarro, the military governor of the prison, hears that the prison is going to be looked at by inspectors who make sure that the prison is being properly managed. He knows that he should not have locked Florestan up, so decides to kill him before the inspection starts. He asks Rocco to dig the grave so that he can get rid of the body quickly. Rocco does not want to do this, but has to agree."
"Leonore lets the prisoners have a walk in the garden. Rocco tells Leonore that he must help him dig the grave. Rocco is very cross that the prisoners are walking in the garden, but Rocco says they should be allowed because it is the King’s name-day. Rocco says they should be locked up again. So he locked them again."
Act II.
Florestan sits alone in his cell. In his mind he imagines an angel who looks like his wife who is telling him to come to Heaven.
"Leonore goes with Rocco to the prisoner. She is still not sure whether it is her husband. She gives him some bread. When Pizarro comes he gets ready to kill Florestan, but Leonore stands between them and tells Pizarro she will shoot him if he comes nearer. A trumpet is heard playing a fanfare because the Minister is arriving."
"Outside the prison the Minister says that all the prisoners are now free. He is horrified to find Florestan among the prisoners, because he is his friend. The crowd ask for Pizarro to be punished. Leonore frees her husband from his chains and the crowd say that she is a great heroine."
The Overtures.
"Beethoven made several changes to the opera at different times. This included writing four different overtures. They are called ""Leonore 1"", ""Leonore 2"", ""Leonore 3"" and ""Fidelio"". The overture ""Fidelio"" is the one that is normally heard now at the beginning of the opera. ""Leonore 2"" was the overture performed at the first performance in 1805. ""Leonore 3"", composed in 1806, is the most famous of the overtures. ""Leonore 1"" may have been written in 1805, or it may have been intended for a performance in 1807 in Prague which never took place"". Sometimes the ""Leonore 3"" overture is played during Act II between the two scenes. However, many people think it does not work dramatically there. It is usually heard today as a separate concert piece. The overture ""Fidelio"" was composed for performances of the opera in 1814."
Für Elise
"""Für Elise"" (German for ""For Elise"") is the common name of the ""Bagatelle in A minor"", written by Ludwig van Beethoven in 1810. The song is thought to be written for Therese, a woman that Beethoven wanted to marry in 1810, however his handwriting was misspelt undergoing transcription, allowing the piece to be known as Fur Elise rather the Fur Therese. Therese did not want to marry him."
"The piece of music, which was written for the piano, was not published until 1865, a long time after Beethoven’s death. It is one of the most well-known pieces of piano music in the world."
Form.
"The piece is in rondo form. There is a main section (A) which appears three times. Between these three sections there are two other sections (B and C), so the form of the piece can be described as: A B A C A."
"The main section has a time signature of 3/8. It is based on arpeggios which flow from one hand to the other. This is the section that many beginner pianists want to play. The two middle sections are harder to play at the correct speed. They have fast scales, arpeggios and left hand demisemiquavers (32nd notes)."

Teplice
"Teplice (German name: Teplitz) is a city in Bohemia, the western area of the Czech Republic. Teplice (pronounced in Czech: “Tep-li-tse”) is a famous spa town where, in earlier times, lots of famous people went for holidays to improve their health. Goethe, Beethoven, Chopin, Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner all stayed there."
Teplice lies between Prague and Dresden in a mountain area called Krušné hory (Iron Mountains). In the year 762 hot springs were found there. The waters from these springs helped people who were ill to get better so it became a spa town.
"Since 1990 many buildings have been restored. The Krušnohorské divadlo (Krušnohorské theatre) is now being refurbished. The North Bohemia Philharmonic Orchestra give concerts there in the open air. There is a museum and many restaurants, wine bars and cafés. In the winter the mountain slopes are good for skiing."
Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)
"Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125, is a symphony written by Ludwig van Beethoven. It is one of the most famous pieces of music ever written."
"A symphony is a piece of music for orchestra. Beethoven wrote nine symphonies. This one, the last one he wrote, is very unusual because the last movement also has singing in it: there are four soloists (soprano, alto, tenor and bass) and a choir. This is why it is known as the “choral” symphony (“choral” means: “for choir”). It is a very long work, lasting more than an hour. This, too, was unusual."
"This symphony has four movements. The first movement is in sonata form. The second and third movements come the other way round from the usual order: the second movement is the scherzo and the third movement is the slow movement. It is a theme and variations. The last movement sets the words of a poem by Friedrich Schiller, a famous poet who had only recently died. The poem was called ""Ode an die Freude"" (in English: ""Ode to Joy""). The poem has a strong message to all mankind: it is about living in peace and harmony together. It was written at the time of the French Revolution when these ideas were becoming very important in Europe."
"The main tune of the last movement (sung to the words: “Freude, schöne Götterfunken, Tochter aus Elysium”) is one of the best known tunes in the world. Many children like to play it on instruments because the first part of the tune only uses five notes (it can be played on C, D, E, F, G). When the tune comes the first time in the symphony it is played by the cellos and double basses."
"The ""Ode to Joy"" was adopted as Europe's “National anthem” in 1972, with an official arrangement for orchestra written by Herbert von Karajan."
"Beethoven had been interested in Schiller’s famous poem since he was young. In 1817 he started to write the first two movements of the symphony. In 1822 he decided to use Schiller’s poem in the symphony. Most of the rest of the symphony was written in 1823 and he finished it in 1824. It was first performed in May of that year. Beethoven conducted the performance. The story is told that he wondered why the audience were not applauding when it had finished. They were applauding, but Beethoven was deaf so he could not hear. Caroline Unger, the alto soloist, made him turn round, and he saw that people were applauding enthusiastically."
Brittle star
"Brittle stars are Echinoderms of the Class Ophiuroidea. The adults are superficially like starfish, but they are a different group, with different larvae. Like other echinoderms, they do have a skeleton of calcareous plates, and radial symmetry. There are about 1500 different species."
"Usually they have 5 ""arms"", which can grow long, up to 60 cm, in the largest species. The central disk of brittle stars can be three to eight inches in diameter. Unlike starfish, they live deeper in the ocean. Ophiuroids are known even from abyssal (&gt;6000 m) depths. However, brittle stars are also common members of reef communities, where they hide under rocks and even within other living organisms. Generally, brittle stars live below 500m of depth."
"There are two related groups of Ophiuroids: the ""Ophiurida"" (brittle stars) and the basket stars (""Eurialida""). Basket stars usually live in the deeper parts of the range. Brittle stars are mostly scavengers and detrivores, able to catch some small prey on occasion."
Description.
"Many brittle stars are more fragile than starfish, which is how they got their name. When they are picked up, their arms may fall off. This might make the animal seem brittle, but they often do this as a defense to escape from predators."
Movement.
"Brittle stars do not use their tube feet for movement, but instead use muscles in their long, thin arms to go around rocks. Ophiurids move quickly when disturbed, and are faster movers than starfish. In living ophiuroids the plates are linked by longitudinal muscles. Ophiurid arms only move horizontally. The way their plates interlock prevents the arms from moving in any other plane.p64 In contrast, basket star arms can move vertically. These movement patterns are distinct, and separate the groups."
"Ophiuroids in general are mostly scavengers or detritivores. Small organic particles are moved into the mouth by the tube feet. Ophiuroids may also prey on small crustaceans or worms. Brittle stars will eat small suspended organisms if available. In large, crowded areas, brittle stars eat suspended matter from prevailing seafloor currents."
Basket stars.
"Basket stars (Euryalids) are large brittle stars with many rays. Their arms branch, and can be moved in any direction. This distinguishes them from the Ophiurids. Basket stars may be capable of suspension feeding, using the mucus coating on their arms to trap plankton and bacteria. They extend one arm out and use the other four as anchors. The arms form so many branches that they are almost feathery on the ends. They get their name because when they stretch their rays out to catch plankton, they look like the bottom of a basket."
"Basket stars can be large and heavy, the biggest Ophiuroids. The largest, ""Gorgonocephalus stimpsoni"", weigh up to 5 kg (11 lbs) and has arms 70cms long, with a disk diameter of 14 cm."
Bivalve
"The bivalves are a large class of molluscs, also known as pelecypods."
They have a hard calcareous shell made of two parts or 'valves'. The soft parts are inside the shell. The shell is usually bilaterally symmetrical.
"There are over 30,000 species of bivalves, including the fossil species. There are about 9,200 living species in 1,260 genera and 106 families. All of them live in the water, most of them in the sea or in brackish water. Some live in fresh water. All are filter feeders: they lost their radula in the course of evolution. A few are carnivorous, eating much larger prey than the tiny microalgae eaten by other bivalves."
"The best known examples of bivalves are clams, mussels, scallops and oysters."
Shell.
"Bivalves have two shells or valves connected by a hinge with hinge teeth. They are made of a calcareous mineral, calcite or aragonite. The valves are covered by a periostracum, which is an organic horny substance. This forms the familiar coloured layer on the shell."
The shells are usually held shut by strong adductor muscles. Scallops can use their muscles to flap the valves and swim.
Food.
A bivalve takes in water that has plankton and other things floating in it.
"Some (but not all) molluscs have a part of their mantle known as the siphon (a tube). Siphons, if they exist, come in pairs, one to suck in, one to expel."
"Anything that is small enough to fit inside the hole of its incurrent siphon enters the bivalve. When the floating material comes in, it gets stuck in slimy mucus that is on the surface of the bivalve's gills. The food is moved down to the mouth, which is on the other side of the siphon. Food is digested in the bivalve's stomach and intestine, and everything that is not digested goes out through the other siphon, with water."
"The siphons are an adaptation of burrowing molluscs. Those that live above the substrate (sediment), such as scallops and oysters, do not need them."
Feeding types.
"There are four feeding types, defined by their gill structure:"
Movement.
Digging.
"As a group, the bivalves are adapted to penetrate into, and to move along horizontally along, soft ground such as mud and sand. Common examples of this are razor shells, which can dig themselves into the sand with great speed to escape enemies, and cockles."
Swimming.
"The Separatists decided to leave England for the Dutch Republic (where religious freedom was permitted). William Bradford went with them. It was illegal to leave England. The group was betrayed by an English sea captain who brought them to the English authorities. Most of the congregation, and Bradford, were put into prison. By the summer of 1608, the Separatists, and William Bradford, escaped to Leiden, Netherlands. Bradford was 18."
In the Dutch Republic.
"William Bradford moved to Amsterdam in August 1608. He lived with the Brewsters in Stink Alley. The Separatists had spent most of their money leaving England and were poor. After nine months, the congregation moved to the smaller city of Leiden."
When Bradford turned 21 he received some money. Bradford purchased his own house. He built a workshop and worked as a weaver. He was liked.
"In 1613, Bradford married Dorothy May, the daughter of a rich English couple living in Amsterdam. In 1617, the Bradfords had their first child, John Bradford."
"By 1617, the Separatists decided to travel to Virginia Colony in North America. The Separatists could practice their religion in the Dutch Republic, they wanted their children to keep their English customs and language. The colonists made a business arrangement with the Merchant Adventurers. These were a group of men who were willing to pay for the Pilgrims to go to the New World with the promise that the pilgrims would pay them back with furs and other goods they got from the colony. By July 1620, Robert Cushman and John Carver had made the plans and fifty Separatists left Delftshaven on the ship ""Speedwell""."
"Many families were split as some Separatists stayed behind in the Netherlands, planning to make the voyage to the New World after the colony had been established. William and Dorothy Bradford left their three-year-old son John with Dorothy's parents in Amsterdam, possibly because he was too frail to make the voyage."
Departure.
"The ""Speedwell"" planned to meet with the ""Mayflower"" and both ships would travel to Virginia Colony. The ""Speedwell"" proved unsafe and the passengers were put on the ""Mayflower"". This made the ship very crowded. Not all the passengers were Separatists. There were about 50 colonists who went because they had certain skills. These skills would prove useful on the ""Mayflower"" and at the colony. Bradford said they hugged each other and cried and said goodbye to family and friends for the last time. They knew they were pilgrims and lifted their eyes to heaven, their dearest country and this comforted them."
The Mayflower Voyage.
"The Mayflower left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the ""Mayflower"" spotted land. The ""Mayflower"" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor."
"They landed on November 21. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. Bradford signed the Mayflower Compact."
Anchored and first explorations at Plymouth Colony.
"Up to this time, Bradford, aged 30, had never been a leader in the colony. When the ""Mayflower"" anchored in the Harbor, the men went out to explore the land for a place where they could live. Bradford volunteered to be a member of the exploration parties. In November and December, these parties went out three times on foot and by boat."
"One of the earliest exploration missions included William Bradford, John Carver, Myles Standish, Edward Winslow, John Howland, Richard Warren, Stephen Hopkins and Edward Doty. Of this group Hopkins was the most experienced, having seen Indians during his time at Jamestown. According to Bradford, they set off in below freezing weather, many of the men already being ill, ""and when the set sail the salt spray froze on their coats, as if they had been glazed"". During their trip they saw Indians who looked like they were cutting up a large whale. When the Indians saw the men they ran away. The men camped and protected themselves from the cold and the Indians."
"They located a place that would be Plymouth Colony in December. During the first expedition on foot, Bradford was caught up in a deer trap made by Native Americans and brought upside down. During the third exploration, on 6 December 1620, Bradford and the other men found Plymouth Bay. A winter storm nearly sank their boat as they came near the bay. The explorers were very cold and started to get sick. The waves were high but they landed on Clark's Island."
"During this time, they searched areas all around the bay and found a place to live and build their homes. The location had a large hill. This hill is now called Burial Hill. It was a good place to build a fort for safety against any possible enemies. There were many brooks providing water. They would later find out that the site had been the location of a Native American village known as Patuxet; and that is why a large area had already been cleared for planting of food. The Patuxet tribe of Indians, between 1616 and 1619, had all died from bad sickness. Bradford later wrote that bones of the dead were easy to find in many places."
Plymouth Colony.
Great sickness.
"The ""Mayflower"" arrived in Plymouth Bay on 20 December 1620. The settlers began building the colony's first house on 25 December."
"On January 11, 1621, as Bradford was helping to build houses when he was got a great pain in his hipbone and fell. Bradford was taken to the ""common house"" (the only house that was finished) and they thought he would die that night, but he did not."
"Bradford got well but many of the pilgrims were not so fortunate. During the months of February and March 1621 sometimes two or three people died every day. By the end of the winter, half of the 100 settlers had died. They buried their dead in secret so the Native Americans would not see how many were dying. They buried them in Cole's Hill and tried to also hide the graves from the animals."
"There were only a small number of men who were healthy. Everyone, including the children had to work and care for the sick. One of these was Captain Myles Standish. He was a soldier who had been hired by the settlers to protect the people of the colony. Standish cared for Bradford during his illness. They became good friends. Bradford had no military experience and when he became governor he would come to trust Captain Standish's advice on military matters."
William was chosen by the people to be Governor of Plymouth Colony. He kept journals (a written record) which are very important even today because they are the only history of how the Mayflower passengers and their families lived in Plymouth Colony. He died before he could finish the second book.
Early service as governor.
"On March 16, the settlers had their first meeting with the Native Americans who lived in the region. Samoset, an Indian walked into the village of Plymouth and greeted them in English. Samoset had learned some English from the traders who had visited the area he was from. This soon led to a visit by Massasoit, the leader of the Pokanoket tribe. At that meeting, Massassoit made a treaty with Governor John Carver. The treaty said that they would be friends and protect each other against unfriendly Indians."
Bradford wrote down what was said. He would soon become governor and the treaty that was very important was the promise to help each other. This agreement was not liked by Massasoit's enemies in other tribes.
"In April 1621, Governor Carver became sick while working in the fields on a hot day. He died a few days later. The settlers of Plymouth then chose Bradford as the new governor. Bradford would remain governor most of his life."
"The elected leadership of Plymouth Colony was at first a governor and an assistant governor. The assistant governor for the first three years of the colony's history was Isaac Allerton. In 1624, it was changed to five assistants. This was called the ""governor's council"". These men gave advice to the governor and had a vote on important matters. They helped Bradford in managing the Colony. Assistants during the early years of the colony included Thomas Prence, Stephen Hopkins, John Alden, and John Howland."
Family.
"William Bradford married Dorothy in Amsterdam, Holland on December 10, 1613. They had one son. Dorothy fell from the deck of the Mayflower into the water and drowned a short time after the ship landed. Her husband was on an exploring mission. John was born in Leiden, Holland and died in 1620."
His second wife was Alice Southwarth in Plymouth. They had three children. She died in Plymouth in March 1670 and was buried on Burial Hill in Plymouth near her husband.
"The Indian Ocean is the ocean surrounded by Asia to the north, Australia and the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Southern Ocean to the south, and Africa and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. It is named for the river Indus and Ancient India on its north shore. The Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea, the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea are all parts of this ocean."
"The deepest point in the Indian Ocean is in the Java Trench near the Sunda Islands in the east, 7500 m (25,344 feet) deep. The average depth is 3,890 m (12,762 ft). The Indian Ocean is the third largest ocean, 28,350,000 square miles in size. The majority is in the southern hemisphere."
Arctic Ocean
"The Arctic Ocean is the ocean around the North Pole. The most northern parts of Eurasia and North America are around the Arctic Ocean. Thick pack ice and snow cover almost all of this ocean in winter, and most of it in summer. An icebreaker or a nuclear-powered submarine can use the Northwest Passage through the Arctic Ocean to go between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans."
"The ocean's area is about 14.056 million km2, which is the smallest of the world's 5 oceans, and it has of coastline. The central surface covered by ice about thick. The biology there is quite special. Endangered species there include walruses, whales and polar bears. Year by year the Arctic Ocean is becoming less icy, as a result of global warming."
"The average depth of the Arctic Ocean is . The deepest point is in the Eurasian Basin, at ."
Geography.
"The Arctic Ocean covers an area of about 14,056,000 km2. The coastline is 45,390 km (28,200 mi) long It is surrounded by Eurasia, North America, Greenland, and by several islands."
"It is generally taken to include Baffin Bay, Barents Sea, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, East Siberian Sea, Greenland Sea, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Kara Sea, Laptev Sea, White Sea and other bodies of water. It is connected to the Pacific Ocean by the Bering Strait and to the Atlantic Ocean through the Greenland Sea and Labrador Sea."
"Countries bordering the Arctic Ocean are: Russia, Norway, Iceland, Greenland, Canada and the United States."
Climate.
"The Arctic Ocean is in a polar climate. Winters are characterized by the polar night, cold and stable weather conditions, and clear skies."
"The temperature of the surface of the Arctic Ocean is fairly constant, near the freezing point of seawater. Arctic Ocean consists of saltwater but its salinity is less than other oceans. The temperature must reach −1.8 °C (28.8 °F) before freezing occurs."
Ice covers most of the Arctic Ocean. It covers almost the whole ocean in late winter and the majority of the ocean in late summer. Much of the Arctic ice pack is covered in snow for about 10 months of the year. The maximum snow cover is in March or April — about 20 to 50 cm (7.9 to 19.7 in).
"The climate of the Arctic region has varied significantly in the past. As recently as 55 million years ago, during the eocene epoch, the region reached an average annual temperature of 10–20 °C (50–68 °F). The surface waters of the Arctic Ocean warmed enough to support tropical lifeforms."
Animal and plant life.
Endangered marine species in the Arctic Ocean include walruses and whales. The area has a fragile ecosystem. The Arctic Ocean has relatively little plant life except for phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are a crucial part of the ocean. They feed on nutrients from rivers and the currents of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
Inuit
"The Inuit are one of many groups of First Nations who live in very cold places of northern Canada, Greenland, the Arctic, and Alaska."
"They are sometimes called ""Eskimos"", a word which likely comes from the Algonquin language and may mean ""eater of raw meat"" which is a fallacy many believe due to misinformation. The term Eskimo means ""netter of snowshoes. Most Inuit prefer to be called by their own name, either the more general Inuit particularly in Canada or their actual tribe name. Inuit is a tribe name but not all indigenous Arctic peoples in North America are Inuits. Particularly in the United States Alaska, the word Eskimo would be accepted as a more general term, but would probably refer to themselves by their tribe name."
Etymology.
"Inuit in Canada and Greenland like the name ""Inuit"" because it is their own name for themselves. ""Inuit"" means more than one, one person is an ""Inuk"". The native Greenlanders are related to the Inuit. The language of the Inuit is Inuktitut, and it is one of the official languages of Nunavut and of the Northwest Territories in Canada. Eskimo is a term more frequently used in mainstream United States where such concerns get less attention."
"Inuits in Alaska have various concerns, such as protecting the caribou from American oil pipelines. Anti-seal hunt campaigns work to eliminate this aspect of northern culture, which most Inuits regard as vital to their lives."
Traditional culture.
"Inuit ate both raw and cooked meat and fish, as well as the fetus's of pregnant animals. Whale blubber was burned as fuel for cooking and lamps."
"Inuit were also Nomadic people, but they did not domesticate any animals except for dogs, which they used to pull their sleds and help with the hunting. They were hunter-gatherers, living off the land. They were very careful to make good use of every part of the animals they killed. Respect for the land and the animals they harvested was and is a focal part of their culture."
"Inuit lived in tents made of animal skins during the summer. In the winter they lived in sod houses and igloos. They could build an igloo out of snow bricks in just a couple of hours. Snow is full of air spaces, which helps it hold in warmth. With just a blubber lamp for heat, an igloo could be warmer than the air outside. The Inuit made very clever things from the bones, antlers, and wood they had. They invented the harpoon, which was used to hunt seals and whales. They built boats from wood or bone covered with animal skins. They invented the ""kayak"" for one man to use for hunting the ocean and among the pack ice."
"Inuit sleds could be built from wood, bone, or even animal skins wrapped around frozen fish. Dishes were made from carving soapstone, bones, or musk ox horns. They wore two layers of skins, one fur side in, the other facing out, to stay warm."
"Inuit had to be good hunters to survive. When an animal was killed in a hunt, it was thanked respectfully for offering itself to the hunter. They believed it intended to provide itself as a gift towards the survival of the hunter and his children. Their gratitude was deeply sincere and is an important aspect of their belief system. In the winter, seals did not come out onto the ice. They only came up for air at holes they chewed in the ice. Inuit would use their dogs to find the air holes, then wait patiently until the seal came back to breathe and kill it with a harpoon. In the summer, the seals would lie out on the ice enjoying the sun. The hunter would have to slowly creep up on a seal to kill it. The Inuit would use their dogs and spears to hunt polar bears, musk ox, and caribou. Sometimes they would kill caribou from their boats as the animals crossed the rivers on their migration."
"The Inuit even hunted whales. From their boat, they would throw harpoons that were attached to floats made of inflated seal skins. The whale would grow tired from dragging the floats under the water. When it slowed down and came up to the surface, the Inuit could keep hitting it with more harpoons or spears until it died. Whale blubber provide Vitamin D and Omegas to their cultural diet, and prevented rickets. The whaling industry around the world has depleted the whale population, and now traditional whale hunting for subsistence purposes is rare around the world. Inuits have added to their modern northern diet with grocery foods, which are normally very expensive in the north."
"The lateral line detects changes in water pressure. It is open to the environment by a line of pores. This and the sound-detecting organs are grouped together as the 'acoustico-lateralis system', because they have a common origin. In bony fish and tetrapods the external opening into the inner ear has been lost."
This system is found in other fish as well. It detects motion or vibrations in water. The shark can sense frequencies in the range of 25 to 50 Hz.
Reproduction.
"About 70% of all known shark species give birth to live young, with the gestation period lasting from 6 to 22 months."
"Pups are born with a full set of teeth, and are capable of taking care of themselves. Once born, they quickly swim away from their mothers, who sometimes feed on the pups. Litters vary from one or two pups (great white shark) to one hundred pups (blue shark and whale shark)."
"Some sharks are oviparous, laying their eggs in the water. Shark eggs (sometimes called ""mermaid's purses"") are covered by a tough, leathery membrane."
"Most sharks are ovoviviparous, meaning the eggs hatch inside the female's body, with the babies developing within the mother, but there is no placenta to nourish the pups. Instead the young feed on the egg's yolk. The pups eat any unfertilized eggs and sometimes each other. Very few pups in a litter survive until birth due to this form of sibling cannibalism. Great white sharks, mako sharks, nurse sharks, tiger sharks, and sand tiger sharks give birth this way."
"Some sharks are viviparous, meaning that the females give live birth: the eggs hatch inside the female's body, and the babies are fed by a placenta. The placenta helps transfer nutrients and oxygen from the mother's bloodstream and transfers waste products from the baby to the mother for elimination. Examples of viviparous sharks include the bull sharks, the whitetip reef sharks, the lemon sharks, the blue sharks, the silvertip sharks, and the hammerhead sharks. Although long thought to be oviparous, whale sharks are viviparous, and pregnant females have been found containing hundreds of pups."
New shark discoveries.
"New sharks are still being found. Dave Ebert found ten new species in a Taiwan market. Over the past three decades he has named 24 new species. They include sharks, rays, sawfish and ghost sharks these cartilaginous fish are all related."
Fishing.
"Some sharks are not endangered, but some are hunted for food (like shark fin soup) or sport fishing. In 2013 five species of shark, along with two species of manta ray, received international protection as part of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species."
"It is thought that 100 million sharks are killed by commercial and recreational fishing. Sharks are a common seafood in many places, including Japan and Australia. In the Australian state of Victoria, shark is the most commonly used fish in fish and chips, in which fillets are battered and deep-fried or crumbed and grilled. In fish and chip shops, shark is called ""flake"". In India, small sharks or baby sharks (called ""sora"" in Tamil and Telugu languages) are sold in local markets. Since the flesh is not matured (not adult), cooking the flesh breaks it into powder. The powder is then fried in oil and spices (called sora puttu/sora poratu). The soft bones can be easily chewed. They are considered a delicacy in coastal Tamil Nadu."
Vulture
Vultures are large birds of prey that usually feed on the carrion or (dead or dying animals and rocks). Vultures use their large wings to soar in the air for many miles without having to flap. Vultures are also called buzzards.
"""Vultures"" from the Old World (Europe, Asia, and Africa) are not related to the vultures of the New World (North and South America). They look quite similar, though. Both have heads and necks with no feathers."
"""Old World vultures"" are related to eagles and hawks and use sight to find their food. ""New World vultures"" are related to storks and use their sense of smell to find their food. Vultures symbolize death in literature."
"King vultures use rocks to open eggs, they pick up a rock with their beak and simply drop or throw the rock onto the egg and breaks it."
New World vultures is a name which is used for a number of species in the Americas. The best known of these are probably the Andean condor and the black vulture.
Eagle
"Eagle is a general term for many large birds of prey. Over 60 species have been described, and they live in many parts of the world. Most species of eagle are found in Eurasia and in Africa."
"Eagles are not a natural monophyletic group. The name describes a bird of prey big enough to hunt larger vertebrates. Eagles hunt during the day and have very good eyesight. Eagles are generally put in the family Accipitridae. They belong to several groups of genera, some of which are closely related."
"The largest eagle that has ever lived is Haast's eagle. It is the only eagle in the world ever to have been top predator of its ecosystem. Though it is now extinct, it lived in New Zealand. Before man got there, it preyed on moas."
"Eagles are carnivores. This means that they eat meat from other animals. Eagles are birds of prey, and so are vultures, falcons and owls. Eagles use their strong talons to catch and grab their food, and they use their sharp beaks to help them tear into the meat of their prey."
Falcon
"Falcons are small to medium-sized birds of prey related to hawks, eagles, and vultures. They usually have pointed wings and long tails."
"Most falcons eat small mammals. Some species hunt other birds, which they take in flight. Like hawks, most falcons have dark gray or brown backs and wings, with white undersides."
"The peregrine falcon is found over most of the world and is famous for hunting birds by diving down on them at 320 km/h (200 mi/h). It was nearly wiped out in North America by the use of pesticides, but has since made a recovery."
In some countries falcons are used in falconry. This means people catch the birds and make them hunt for them. Long ago this was a way for people to get more food but today it is a sport.
"Dump trucks (""tippers"" in the UK) carry sand, gravel, and dirt. Most dump trucks have an open-top box bed with an opening ""tail-gate"" door on the back. The body lifts up at the front. The load falls out the tailgate and is ""dumped"" on the ground behind the truck."
Flatbed trucks have a flat body with no sides. There is a wall between the cab and the body. The load will not move forward and hit the cab. The truck can be loaded from the side or top. Nothing covers the load. Some trucks have sides that can be taken off or folded down. Many times the load is covered with tarps.
Garbage trucks pick up garbage and trash from homes and some businesses. Most were loaded from the rear. Now some load from the front or side. The same type of truck is often used for recycling.
"Semi-tractors (""artics"" in the UK) have no bodies. They have a ""fifth wheel"" that carries weight. A semi-trailer has no front wheels. The front of the trailer goes on the fifth wheel. The semi-tractor carries weight from the trailer and pulls the trailer"
"Tank trucks (""tankers"" in the UK) are designed to carry liquids or gases. They usually have a round tank that is long (a cylinder) lying on its side. There are many types of tanks because there are many liquids and gases. Most tankers are built for only one liquid."
"Boom Truck is a truck with a hydraulic arm. The hydraulic arm on a boom truck is called the boom. This boom will reach out past the end of the vehicle, and it will grab the vehicles that need to be towed. The boom of the truck remains in a fixed position, which allows it to be a very stable option when it comes to towing."
"Wreckers (""recovery lorries"" in the UK and sometimes ""tow trucks"" in the US) are used to lift and tow broken cars and trucks. They usually have a boom with a cable. Cars are often carried on special flatbeds."
Crown-of-thorns starfish
"The crown-of-thorns starfish (""Acanthaster planci"") is a type of sea star. Usually, they have orange-red to purplish skin, with yellow or pink spikes on their skin. The crown-of-thorns is also one of the largest starfish in the world, as it has a diameter of up to 3 feet. The crown-of-thorns lives in the warmer areas of the Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Red Sea."
"It only feeds on coral polyps, and usually at night. The crown-of-thorns climbs over its prey, releases digestive enzymes to break down its food, and then absorbs the coral polyp, which has now turned into a liquid. What's left behind by the sea star is the leftover coral skeleton."
"They are usually of subdued colours, pale brown to grey-green, but they may be garish with bright warning colours in some parts of their wide range. These bright colours warn animals that may want to eat it that it is venomous."
Effect on coral reefs.
"The crown-of-thorns is well known for its destructive habits of eating coral, especially on the Great Barrier Reef, which is a World Heritage Site. Usually, when there are not too many of them, these sea stars help maintain the coral reef by preventing the faster-growing coral from taking over the coral reef. However, when there are too many crown-of-thorns, they can devastate the reef."
Sea urchin
"Sea urchins are the Class Echinoidea of the Phylum Echinodermata. Like the rest of the Echinoderms, literally ""spike-skinned"", they are entirely marine. They are usually globe-shaped, and protected by calcareous plates and spines.p65 ""Urchin"" is an old word for hedgehog, and in many foreign languages these animals are called ""sea hedgehogs""."
"Like other echinoderms they have five-fold symmetry (called pentamerism) and move by means of hundreds of tiny, transparent, adhesive 'tube feet'. The symmetry is not obvious in the living animal, but is easily visible in the dried test."
"Sea urchins mostly feed on algae and small animals. They have a special chewing apparatus called ""Aristotle's lantern"", after the Greek philosopher Aristotle who was fascinated by sea urchins. With this apparatus they can scrape organisms stuck to the surface over which the urchin is moving."
Spines.
"The spines are long and sharp in some species, and protect the urchin from predators. The spines inflict a painful wound when they penetrate human skin, but are usually not dangerous. Echinoids also have pincer-like pedicellaria all over their body between the spines. The job of these is to deal with anything (like larvae) settling on the test (outer shell).p101 It is not known if the spines are venomous (unlike the pedicellariae between the spines, which are venomous)."
"Typical sea urchins have spines that are in length, thick, and not terribly sharp. ""Diadema antillarum"", familiar in the Caribbean, has thin, potentially dangerous spines that can reach long."
Teeth.
Sea urchins have five jaws with one tooth each. The teeth grow throughout the sea urchin's life. The teeth of the pink sea urchin chip against each other to stay sharp.
Ecology.
"Sea urchins feed mainly on algae, but can also feed on sea cucumbers, and a wide range of invertebrates such as mussels, polychaetes, sponges, brittle stars and crinoids. Sea urchins are one of the favorite foods of sea otters and wolf eels. Without predators to eat them, urchins breed in large numbers and eat almost all the nearby kelp, creating an ""urchin barren"", devoid of macroalgae and associated fauna. Sea otters have re-entered British Columbia, dramatically improving coastal ecosystem health by eating sea urchins."
Fossil record and evolution.
"The first echinoid fossils are from the Lower Ordovician period. The earliest forms had flexible tests, with plates that could slide over each other. Echinoids were a relatively unimportant part of the biota in the Palaeozoic. Only one group survived the P/Tr extinction event to form the basis of all later echinoids. The group which survived into the Triassic, the Cidaroids, radiated into all other modern groups, which are known as the Euechinoids."
"The break with perfect symmetry, which happened in the Jurassic, gave them definite front and back ends. This opened up new habitats, in particular, the burrowing habitat. Sand dollars and heart urchins have been highly successful. The living echinoids are now important members of the biota, especially in shallow and in-shore waters."
Sea urchins as food.
"Some humans eat the reproductive organs of sea urchins (which they call roe). This is popular in Korea. In Japan, this kind of sushi is called ""uni""."
Beer
"Beer is a type of alcoholic drink. It is made with water, hops, barley (types of cereal grains), and types of yeast (a fungus that produces alcohol). A process called fermentation turns sugar into alcohol, using yeast. Another product of the fermentation is carbon dioxide."
Classification from the type of fermentation.
"In general, all alcoholic drinks where yeast turns sugar into alcohol are called ""beer"". In these cases, distillation is not used. The difference to wine is that with wine, sugars from plants, such as fruit sugar, or that made by animals is used. As an example, mead is a wine made from honey. Japanese sake is made from rice, and uses yeast for fermentation; so even if some people call it ""rice wine"", sake is really a kind of beer."
Making beer.
"The act of making beer is called ""brewing"". Beer is made by adding warm water to malted barley and other grains. The enzymes in the barley change the malted barley and other grains into simple sugars. This is called the mash. The water is then sparged (drained) from the grain. The water is now called wort. The wort is boiled and hops are added. Hops provide flavour and preserve the beer. After boiling the wort is cooled and yeast is added. The yeast turns the sugars into alcohol and the wort into beer."
"Different beers can have different natures, depending on the ingredients used; for example, an ale uses top fermenting yeast. Top fermenting yeasts eat more sugar and produce more alcohol. A lager uses bottom fermenting yeast. Bottom fermenting yeasts eat less sugar and produce a crisper, cleaner taste. Adding hops makes the beer more bitter and aromatic. Specialty malts (different types of cooked barley) produce different flavours and colours. These flavours and colours are most notable in dark beers like Porter and Stout."
"Different countries have different ways to make beer. In Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Czech Republic, and Slovakia, beer is usually made from just hops, malt, water, and yeast. This is because of the Reinheitsgebot. The Reinheitsgebot was a law that said says that beer can only be made from hops, malt, and water. Yeast was discovered after the Reinheitsgebot. The law was overturned by the European Union in 1992. In Belgium, however, beers have always been made with wheat, sugar, fruit, and other ingredients."
Different ways to make beer.
The type of yeast used determines the kind of beer made:
The history of beer.
"The earliest records of beer were written around 7000 years ago by the Sumerians. It is said that the Sumerians discovered the fermentation process by accident. It is not known exactly how this happened, but it could be that a piece of bread or grain became wet, and a short time later, it began to ferment and made a pulp that caused people to become drunk. A seal around 4,000 years old is a Sumerian ""Hymn to Ninkasi"", the goddess of brewing. This ""hymn"" is also a recipe for making beer. A description of the making of beer on this ancient engraving in the Sumerian language is the earliest account of what is easily recognised as barley, followed by a pictograph of bread being baked, crumbled into water to form a mash, and then made into a drink, that is recorded as having made people feel ""...wonderful and blissful"". It could even be possible that bread was first baked to be a way to make beer that is easy to carry around. The Sumerians were probably the first people to brew beer. They had found a ""divine drink"" -- they felt it was a gift from the gods."
Amount of alcohol in beer.
"""Normal"" beers have around 3-5 % alcohol (for the volume, i.e. in 100ml beer there is 3-5ml alcohol). In brewing beer, the amount of alcohol can be made more or less quite easily. The Belgian types of beer are made by adding more sugar. Through the fermentation, this will then turn to alcohol. Today, there are beers with between 2% and about 16% of alcohol (about the same alcohol content as wine). Spirits can have up to 80% alcohol. Some beer labels say there is no alcohol in them because it was taken out later. This is not completely true, though. Beers ""without alcohol"" usually do have less than 1% of alcohol."
IP address
"An IP address (short for Internet Protocol address) is a label which is used to identify one or more devices on a computer network, such as the internet. It can be compared to a postal address. An IP address is a long"
"number written in binary. Since such numbers are difficult to communicate, IP addresses are usually written as a set of numbers in a given order. Devices using IP addresses use the internet protocol to communicate."
Registration.
"The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority assigns IP addresses to regional internet registries (RIRs). The RIRs assign them to Internet Service Providers. Internet Service Providers then assign IP addresses to their customers. Very often, people have a router or gateway at home, to which they connect computers, printers, and other devices. These routers or gateways are often configured to assign ""local"" IP addresses to the devices that are connected."
Parts.
"Each address has two parts: one that specifies the computer or group of computers, and another which specifies the network. A device can have more than one IP address. Certain types of IP addresses are used to address a group of devices, while others are used to address only one device. Certain types of addresses are unique, others can be re-used. A number of IP addresses are used for special purposes, for example to obtain an IP address automatically."
MAC address.
"An IP address is converted to physical or Media Access Control Address using the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). If an IP address is your phone number, then your MAC address is your name. You may change your phone number, but your name will not change."
Example.
"Suppose one of our friends wants to meet us but they don't know our address. He asks for our address and then we give our address (Example: 123 Main Street, Anytown, USA). After giving the address, he or she can easily locate our address. The same thing is done in case of internet. Every network is assigned an address."
Who allocates IP Address.
IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) allocates the IP address. IANA is responsible for the IP addressing system.
What an IP address looks like.
"An IP address is a long binary number, made of ones and zeros. An IPv4 address is 32 binary digits (or bits) long. An IPv6 is 128 bits long, allowing many more IP addresses to be used. IP addresses are usually written in human-readable form, where 8 bits are grouped into one octet. IPv4 addresses are usually written as a group of four numbers. Each number can take a value from 0 to 255. IPv6 addresses are written as a group of eight hexadecimal numbers. Many Ipv6 addresses contain many zeroes. There are special rules which say that in certain cases, these zeroes do not need to be written."
Public and private addresses.
"Flaumbach,"
"Altlayer Bach,"
"Baybach,"
Ehrbach.
Bible
"The Bible, also known as the Holy Bible, is a group of religious texts of Judaism and Christianity, it contains both The Old Testament and The New Testament. The word Bible comes from the Greek word τὰ (""biblía"") which means ""books"" in English, because it is many books in one book. It includes laws, stories, prayers, songs, and wise words. A number of texts are both in the Hebrew Bible, used by Jews, and this Christian one."
"In considering the source and inspiration for the Bible one must see what the Bible says of itself. Several verses of scripture define the source, intent, and Author. 2 Peter 1:21 says this - ""No prophecy was ever made by the act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God."" Isaiah 55:11 tells us that His is a word of power - ""So shall My sword be that goes forth from My mouth; It shall not return to Me void, But it shall accomplish what I please, And it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it."" Hebrews 4:12 says this - ""For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart."""
"When talking about the Bible, a ""book"" is used to speak about a number of texts. All the texts that make a ""book"" are believed to belong together. Most of the time, people believe they were written or collected by the same person. The Bible contains different kinds of such books. Some are history, telling the stories of the Jews, Jesus, or Jesus' followers. Some are collections of wise sayings. Some are God's commands to his people, which he expects them to obey. Some are songs of praise to God. Some are books of ""prophecy"", messages from God that he gave through chosen people called prophets."
"Different groups of Christians do not agree which texts should be included in the Bible. Christian Bibles range from the 66 books of the Protestant canon to 81 books in the Ethiopian Orthodox Bible. The oldest surviving Christian Bible is the Codex Sinaiticus, a Greek manuscript from the fourth century AD. The oldest complete Hebrew manuscripts date from the Middle Ages."
How it was written.
"For a long time the texts were passed on by word of mouth from generation to generation. The Bible was written long ago in Aramaic, Hebrew, and Greek. Translations were made later into Latin and some other languages. Now there are translations in English and many other languages. The books of the Hebrew Bible—what Christians call the Old Testament—were not all written at the same time. It took hundreds of years (about 1200 years). The process of putting it all together began around 400 B.C. The books of the New Testament, which was originally written in Greek, began to be collected together in about 100 A.D. It tells about events that happened between 4 B.C. and 70 A.D. These events included the birth, life, death and resurrection of Jesus. It also tells how his followers went around spreading his message. It ends with a description of how the world will end when Jesus returns to earth. Most of the writers of the New Testament were apostles of Jesus. These were people who said they had seen Jesus alive after his crucifixion."
Translations and versions.
A translation is when a scribe takes the source in one language and writes it in another language. Most texts of the Bible were written in Ancient Greek or in Aramaic or Hebrew.
"The first to provide a translation into Latin was Jerome, in the 5th century. He started what is known as the Vulgate today. Wufila translated the Bible into the Gothic language. In the early Middle Ages, people such as Petrus Valdes, and Jan Hus provided translations."
"The New Testament was first translated into English in 1382 by John Wycliffe, and his associates translated the Old Testament. The translation was made from the Vulgate Latin bible. Wycliffe did this so that people could see for themselves what the Bible said. The translation was completed in 1382. There were some later editions by other people to the Wycliffe bible, as it is called. It was translated into Middle English, the language of his day. Wycliffe did not have Church permission to do this, but he was protected by John of Gaunt, one of the most powerful men in the kingdom. After both Wycliffe and his protector were dead, the Church declared Wycliffe a heretic in 1415, and banned his writings. The Council of Constance decreed Wycliffe's works should be burned and his remains exhumed (dug up). Why was the Church so opposed? The translations challenged the Church's authority over the people. In church, explaining the Bible was the priest's work. Whatever he said could not be challenged. Once the ordinary people could read the Bible, they might have other opinions."
"The next step in translation was done in 1525 by William Tyndale. His translation was into Early Modern English, which we can just about understand today. Tyndale also did it without Church permission. His was the first translation to be printed, and several thousand copies were made. He had no protector, and his fate was terrible. He fled to Europe, but the agents of Thomas More (Chancellor of England at the time) eventually found him. Both Tyndale and his printer were executed by burning at the stake."
Another well known translation is the 1611 King James translation (commonly known as the Authorized King James Version of the Bible).
Some texts were written by historians who tried to show what Ancient Israel was like. Other texts are poems about God and his work. And others were used to make laws. Followers of Judaism and Christianity consider the Bible sacred but they do not all agree about what belongs in the Bible. What is considered part of the Bible changed with history. Different denominations include certain parts or leave out other parts. There is not one single version of the Bible; both the content of the books and their order may change.
"Languages do not match. When a translation is done, the translator has to decide between translation word for word, or capturing the sense of the text. When he decides to capture the sense, he will choose other words in the target language. This is called paraphrasing."
"Today there are dozens of versions of the Bible. Some are translations and some are paraphrases. A paraphrased version is where people take a translation and put it in their own words. As the Bible has been translated into modern languages, it is also possible that there are different translations of the same texts. The Bible is the best selling book of all time. 2.5 billion to more than 6 billion copies of the Bible have been sold to date. A complete version of the Bible exists in 471 languages. Parts have been translated in 2225 languages. Most Bibles can be found in the British Museum in London."
Old Testament.
"The Christian Bible is a collection of 66 books. The first 39 books are the Old Testament. It is the first part of the God's story of salvation. ""Salvation"" is God's long work of saving us from our sins. ""Sin"" is what happened when people decided to live their own way instead of God's way in the world that God created. That was when God began His great work of saving us from our sins."
"To prepare the way, God had to destroy the whole world by a great flood, except for the family of Noah. Then God raised up a new people for Himself. They were the ancient Hebrews. God promised the Hebrews they would bring His salvation to the whole world."
"The first five books of the Old Testament are mostly the story of how God chose the ancient Hebrews and taught them his laws. Following these are the twelve books that tell the history of the Hebrews. The next five are books of poetry and wisdom. One of these five books, the ""Psalms"", is a book of songs showing mainly how God wants to be worshiped."
"The last seventeen books of the Old Testament were written by Hebrew prophets. These books tell about God's disappointment with the ancient Hebrews and His promise to bring them back to friendship with Him. The prophets also foretell a great surprise God was planning for the world-He was going to send His very own Son, the Messiah (the ""Anointed One""), the Saviour, to save us from our sins."
You can read about this Messiah in the New Testament.
"In the Old Testament, Tanakh was mostly written in Hebrew; a few parts were written in Aramaic. This part of the Bible is considered to be holy by Jews as well as Christians."
"There are also a few books of the Old Testament's time called Deuterocanonical by those Churches that accept them as part of the Bible, and Apocrypha by those that do not."
New Testament.
"The second part is called the New Testament. The main part of this book is the story of the life of Jesus Christ. The four different versions of this story in the New Testament are called the Gospels. After the Gospels, there is also the story of what happened to the Church after Jesus's death and resurrection. Part of this is told through letters by early Christian leaders, especially Saint Paul. The final book of the Bible tells about a vision that St. John, one of the disciples of Jesus, had. In the vision John saw what would happen at the end of the world. This included judgement for evil and happiness for the people who had followed Jesus. One of the most quoted verses in the Bible is : ""For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish [die] but have eternal life."" NIV"
Views about the Bible.
Violin
"The violin is a string instrument which has four strings and is played with a bow. The strings are usually tuned to the notes G, D, A, and E. It is held between the left collar bone (near the shoulder) and the chin. Different notes are made by fingering (pressing on the strings) with the left hand while bowing with the right. Unlike guitar, it has no frets or other markers on the fingerboard."
The violin is the smallest and highest pitched string instrument typically used in western music. A person who plays the violin is called a violinist. A person who makes or repairs violins is called a luthier.
"The violin is important in European and Arabian music. No other instrument has played such an important part in Europe. The modern violin is about 400 years old. Similar string instruments have been around for almost 1000 years. By the time the modern orchestras started to form in the 17th century, the violin was nearly fully developed. It became the most important orchestral instrument - in fact, nearly half of the instruments in the orchestra is made up of violins, which are divided into two parts: ""first violins"" and ""second violins"". Nearly every composer wrote for the violin, whether as a solo instrument, in chamber music, in orchestral music, folk music, and even in jazz."
"The violin is sometimes called a “fiddle”. Someone who plays it is a “fiddler”. To ""fiddle"" means ""to play the fiddle"". This word can be used as a nickname for the violin. It is properly used when talking about folk music, but is used in all kinds of music."
History.
"The word “violin” and the word “viol” come from the same word. The violin was not made directly from the instruments called viols. The word ""violin"" comes from the Middle Latin word ""vitula"". It means ""stringed instrument"". This word is also believed to be the source of the Germanic “fiddle”. The modern European violin changed over time from many different bowed stringed instruments. They were brought from the Middle East and the Byzantine Empire. Most likely, the first makers of violins took ideas from three kinds of current instruments. They are the rebec, in use since the 10th century, the Renaissance fiddle, and the ""lira da braccio."" These instruments were held under the chin and bowed."
"In the 17th century, there were several families of luthiers who were very good at making instruments. The most famous violin makers were Stradivarius, Amati, and Guarneri. Some of the instruments that these luthiers made are still here today. They are kept in museums all around the world. They are some of the best instruments in existence. They can have prices over one million dollars."
Construction.
"The biggest part of the violin is the wooden body. This acts as a resonating box. It makes the vibrating strings sound louder. Many of the parts of the violin are named after parts of the body. The front is called the “belly”. The back is called the “back”. The sides are the “ribs”. The strings go from near the top of the “neck” down the “fingerboard” and on to the “tail piece”. The strings go across the bridge halfway between the end of the fingerboard and the tailpiece. The bridge is not fixed onto the violin. It is held in place by the strings. The strings keep it in place because they are so tight. If the strings are completely loosened, the bridge will not stay on. The bridge helps to send the vibrations of the strings down to the body of the instrument. Inside the body there is a “soundpost”. This is a small piece of wood. It looks like a small finger. It goes from the belly to the back. The soundpost is also held in place by the strings. In the middle of the belly there are two long, curved holes. They are called “f holes”. This is because of their shape. The top of the strings are wound around pegs. The violin can be tuned by turning the pegs. The very top of the neck is called the scroll. Violins today also have a chinrest. This helps to hold the violin against the player's shoulder. A shoulder rest can also be used. These are now made of foam. They have special legs to hold them on to the violin. Many beginners prefer to use a sponge and an elastic band instead."
"To make it easier to tune the violin, many people find it helpful to have “adjusters” for “fine tuning” when the string is only slightly out of tune. These adjusters go through holes in the tailpiece. They stop the strings from slipping when being tuned."
Strings used to be made of gut. They are now mostly made of steel or nylon. Adjusters can only be used with some strings. The front of the violin body is made of spruce. The back and sides of the body are made of maple. The bow can be made of several kinds of wood. An example would be pernambuco. Some players today use bows made of carbon fibre. The bow is strung with horsehair (horsehair is hair that comes from the back of the horse's head also known as the mane or from the horse's tail).
Playing.
"It takes years of practice to become a good violinist. A beginner will start with pieces and or exercises that do not require precise or complicated technique in right or left hand. Some examples of pieces that do not require great technique are ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" by Mozart, ""Children's Song"" (A German folk tune), and ""Over the Rainbow"". During these ""simple"" songs, the violinist will develop fundamental skills necessary for all other techniques, such as proper bow and violin holding. As the musician develops more and more confidence and skill in both left and right hand, pieces and exercises will become progressively more difficult. When necessary, they will also learn techniques and skills that will enhance their playing. Vibrato, smooth bow changes in the right hand, and shifting."
"The violinist has to learn to put the fingers in exactly the right place so that the music is “in tune”. This is called intonation. The musician will also learn vibrato. This changes the intonation of each note slightly by making it a little bit sharper (higher), then a little bit flatter (lower), producing a kind of wobble. This is important in many styles of music to create mood."
"Besides plucking (pizzicato), there are many special effects. Some of them are glissando, portamento, and harmonics. There is also double stopping, chords, and scordatura tuning."
"The violin can be played either standing or sitting down. When playing solo music the violinist normally stands. When playing in chamber music or in orchestras the violinist sits, but this was not always the case. When sitting, the violinist may have to turn his or her right leg in so that it does not get in the way of the bow."
Music.
"In the 17th and 18th centuries, composers wrote a lot of music for solo violin. Many of these composers were from Italy. They were themselves violinists. Some of these violinists are Corelli, Vitali, Vivaldi, Veracini, Geminiani, Locatelli and Tartini."
"In Germany, Schmelzer and Biber wrote some very virtuoso violin music. Later, in the early 18th century, Bach and Handel wrote many masterpieces for the violin."
"In the Classical music period, the great composers Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven all wrote solo works for the violin. They also wrote a large amount of chamber music, especially string quartets."
"In the Romantic period many virtuoso violin works were written. These include concertos by Mendelssohn, Saint-Saëns, Brahms, Bruch, Wieniawski, Tchaikovsky, and Dvořák. In the 20th century, many virtuoso works were written. These include Elgar, Sibelius, Szymanowski, Bartók, Stravinsky, Berg, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Hindemith, and Penderecki. In the 19th century, Niccolò Paganini was the most famous violinist. He composed and played violin music that was harder than anything that had been written before. People compared him to the devil because he could play so brilliantly and because he looked thin and moved his body about in strange ways."
In recent years the violin has also been used in jazz playing. Stéphane Grappelli was especially famous for this.
Famous violinists.
"Some of the most famous violinists of the last century are Fritz Kreisler, Jascha Heifetz, David Oistrakh, Yehudi Menuhin, Ida Haendel, and Isaac Stern. Today some of the greatest players include Itzhak Perlman, Maxim Vengerov, Vadim Repin, Nigel Kennedy, Hilary Hahn, Joshua Bell and fiddler Sara Watkins."

Train station
"A train station or railway station (also called a railroad station, rail station, or depot) is a place where passengers can get on and off trains and/or goods may be loaded or unloaded."
"Early stations were usually built to handle passengers and goods. Today, goods are usually only unloaded at big stations. Stations are next to a railway line, or they are the terminus for a route. Usually there are platforms to let passengers get on and off the train easily and safely. Many stations have things such as shelters, ticket sales and benches."
"The legs of a butterfly are made for walking, holding onto things, and tasting. There are three pairs of legs. There are four main parts of the leg. They are the trochanter, the femur, the tibia, and the foot. At the end of each foot, there is a pair of claws. Butterflies in the family Nymphalidae have very short front legs. They keep there front legs close to their bodies. This makes it look like they only have two pairs of legs. In some species, there is a movable body part on the tibia that is used to clean the antennae."
"A butterfly has two pairs of wings. Each wing has hollow tubes called veins. The colors and patterns of butterflies are made by tiny scales. The scales overlap each other. They are connected to the wing. If a butterfly is handled, the tiny scales may rub off."
Abdomen.
"The abdomen is the third part of the body. It is made up of ten segments. The abdomen is much softer than the head and the thorax. At the end of the abdomen are the reproductive organs. In the male, there is a pair of claspers. They are used to hold on to the female during mating. In the female, there is a tube to lay eggs (the ovipositor)."
Life cycle.
Butterflies go through complete metamorphosis. This means that there are four parts in a butterfly's life. The first part is the egg. The second part is the caterpillar (sometimes called the larva). The third part is the chrysalis (sometimes called the pupa). The fourth part is the adult (sometimes called the imago).
Egg.
"A female butterfly will lay her eggs on or near the food plant of the caterpillar (the food plant is the plant that the caterpillar feeds on). The female will choose a place to lay her eggs using smell, taste, touch, and sight. Most species will lay just one egg on the food plant. Others will lay groups of five to over 100 eggs on the food plant. Most species will lay their eggs on the leaves of the food plant. Others will lay them on the flowers, stems, bark, or fruit of the food plant."
"The eggs come in many different shapes and colours. They may be round or oval, and flattened. In some species, the egg shell is ribbed. The most common colours in butterfly eggs are yellow and green. The eggs will turn dark just before hatching. Also, some butterflies take a day to come out of eggs, while others could take months."
Caterpillar.
"Butterfly caterpillars can vary in size, colour, and shape. They may have spines, bristles, or soft body extensions. All caterpillars have 13 body segments. The first three segments make up the thorax. The thorax has three pairs of legs. These legs are called true legs. The other 10 segments make up the abdomen. The abdomen has five pairs of soft legs called prolegs. The prolegs have tiny hooks at the end of each of the foot. They are used to hold on to things. The hooks are called crochets."
"A caterpillar's skin does not grow. As the caterpillar grows inside its skin, the skin becomes too tight. In order for the caterpillar to grow bigger, it sheds its too-tight skin. After the old skin is shed, there is a new, larger skin. This is known as moulting. A caterpillar will moult four to five times before turning into a pupa. Each stage between moults is called an ""instar""."
All caterpillars can make silk. The silk is made from the salivary glands. Silk starts out as a liquid in the salivary glands. The caterpillar draws out the silk into a small thread. The silk hardens as soon as it is exposed to the air. Caterpillars use silk to make nests or cocoons.
"Most caterpillars feed on leaves of plants or trees. Most species of caterpillars will feed only on a small number of certain kinds of plants. If the caterpillar's food plant is not found, it may starve to death."
"Some species of caterpillars (in the family Lycaenidae) are tended by ants. The caterpillars have special glands that make a sweet liquid called honeydew. The ants like the honeydew. In return for the honeydew, the ants protect the caterpillars from predators. The caterpillars also have special body parts that make sounds. The caterpillar will make sounds with the body parts and ""call"" the ants when the caterpillar is being attacked by predators. The ants hear the sounds and come to protect the caterpillar."
"Caterpillars in the subfamily Miletinae eat insects in the order Hemiptera. This includes aphids, mealybugs, leafhoppers and treehoppers.p356"
"Caterpillars in the family Papilionidae have a special organ. This organ is called an osmeterium. It is a bad-smelling gland that is shaped like a snake's tongue. It is kept behind the inside of the head. When a predator tries to eat the caterpillar, the caterpillar releases the osmeterium. This usually scares the predators away.p161"
Pupa.
"The pupa (plural, pupae) is formed after the last moult. The caterpillar will find a special place to pupate (pupate means to turn into a pupa). The digestive tract is emptied. The caterpillar sheds its skin. The pupa is now exposed. The caterpillar's tissues are broken down and rebuilt into the butterfly's tissues."
The pupa cannot move. It is attached to an object by tiny hooks on the end of the abdomen. These hooks make up what is called the cremaster. There are many tiny holes on the pupa. They allow respiratory gases to move in and out of the pupa.
"Many pupae are easy for predators to attack. Some caterpillars (in the family Hesperiidae and the subfamilies Parnassiinae and Satyrinae) make shelters out of silk and leaves to protect themselves when they become pupae. These shelters are called cocoons. Most butterfly pupae do not have cocoons to protect themselves. Instead, the pupae have brown or green colours to camouflage themselves among leaves and branches. Pupae that do not have cocoons are called chrysalids or chrysalises."
Survival.
"Some butterflies may be in trouble because of habitat loss. Because of the destruction of forests and grasslands, some types of butterflies have nowhere to feed and lay eggs. To help, some people plant a butterfly garden with flowers having lots of nectar for butterflies to feed on. Some people also keep plants that butterflies lay eggs on, and enjoy watching the caterpillars hatch out and feed on the plant. Chemical sprays that are used to keep pests away from garden plants, also kill butterflies."
Nazism
"Nazism (or National Socialism; ) is a set of political beliefs associated with the Nazi Party of Germany. It started in the 1920s, but the Nazi Party gained power in 1933 and started carrying out their ideas in Germany, which they called the Third Reich. They stayed in power in Germany until 1945, when they lost World War II."
"National Socialism is an extreme right-wing, fascist, ideology that is heavily inspired from the works of Oswald Spengler. The Nazis believed that only the Aryan (German) race was capable of building nations and other races, notably the Jewish race, were agents of the corruptive forces of capitalism and Marxism, both of which the Nazis opposed. They considered the Aryan race the 'Master race', which meant that they thought that the Aryans were the most biologically evolved of humans and therefore deserved to have power over all other humans. They adapted Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and applied it to humans."
"The leader of the Nazis Adolf Hitler wanted to a create a country where all Aryans were treated equally. They spent heavily on poorer people and began several huge government programs to help Germany deal with the unemployment and economic crisis caused by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed it. Some Nazis, such as Ernst Röhm, wanted the reforms to go further and called for a revolution, eliminating economic classes in Germany and for the government to take control of major businesses. Many of these Nazis were murdered on Hitler's orders during the Night of the Long Knives because they were a threat to his leadership of the Nazi Party."
"The Nazis blamed the Jewish people for Germany's defeat in World War I. This is known as the Stab in the Back Myth. The Nazis also blamed the Jewish people for rapid inflation and practically every other economic woe facing Germany at the time as a result of their defeat in World War I. For this reason, the Nazis not only viewed the Jewish people as inferior to them, but as oppressors of the Aryan people who were creating inequality. The Nazis' tactic of lazily albeit effectively blaming the Jewish people for all of Germany's problems is a propaganda tactic known as scapegoating and was used to justify the great atrocities committed by the Nazis against the Jewish people."
"To implement the racist ideas, the Nuremberg Race Laws (created in 1935) banned non-Aryans and political opponents of the Nazis from the civil-service. They also forbid any sexual contact between 'Aryan' and 'non-Aryan' persons."
"The Nazis sent millions of Jews, Roma, and other people to concentration camps and death camps, where they were killed. These killings are now called the Holocaust."
"The word ""Nazi"" is short for ""Nationalsozialist"" (supporter of the ""Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei"") in the German language. This means ""National Socialist German Workers' Party""."
Pintupi Nine
"The Pintupi Nine were a group of Aboriginal Australians. They are said to have been the last Aborigines in Australia to come into contact with modern civilisation. The group lived a nomadic, hunter-gatherer way of life in the Great Sandy Desert, before they met with their relatives near Kiwirrkurra in October 1984. Most other groups from this region had left the desert over 20 years before. They had been settled in towns to the east and west, but this group had stayed behind."
"The group belonged to the Pintupi community. They lived on the western side of Lake Mackay, north of where Kiwirrkurra is today. It was made up of a single family. The father of the group had recently died, leaving two widows and seven children, most of whom were young adults. The family was moving south, hoping to find some of their relatives. They came across another family setting up an outstation, but ran away after a misunderstanding. Their relatives from Kiwirrkurra went to find them and then brought them into modern society."
Background.
"Most Pintupi families had been settled in rural communities well over 20 years before. Starting from the 1930s, the Pintupi were forced to leave their homeland because of weapons tests being done at Woomera. Most were taken to Papunya, very far to the east, which is historically Luritja land. Others were moved northwest to Balgo, in Kukatja country. After this time, the Pintupi were said to have given up looking for any of their relatives living in the desert after they lost contact with the general community. They believed such people had died."
"By the 1960s, there were only a few families still living as nomads in the desert. Most of them had heard about White people and places like Papunya. But they had not come into contact with them. They chose to keep living in the way they had always lived. This was a problem, because they were all closely related. Pintupi follow a strict system of kinship (called skin groupings) that says who they can marry. It makes sure they avoid inbreeding. As not many families were left in the big desert, there were almost no eligible partners for the younger men and women."
"Much later, the Aboriginal Land Rights Act would be passed by the Northern Territory in 1976. Many Pintupi started to return to their land to set up permanent communities. They established the town of Kintore in 1981. Further west, Kiwirrkurra was founded in 1983 near Lake Mackay. This salt plain is the heart of the Pintupi homeland, and is where this particular family mostly lived."
Family history.
"The family was originally led by a man named Waku Tjungurrayi. He had four wives: Papalya, Nanu, Watjunka and another woman (whose name is not known to outsiders). These wives were all sisters belonging to the Nangala skin group. Papalya was Waku's main wife. They had three children: Topsy, Warlimpirrnga and Takariya. Waku also had another child, Piyiti, with the fourth (unnamed) sister. In the early years, this family sometimes travelled and hunted with another group. It was led by a man named Tjukurti Tjakamarra (later known as Freddy West). In 1962, West and his family decided they would go to live at Papunya. Waku did not want to leave, so they left Waku's family and went east."
"About a year later, the eldest daughter, Topsy, left the group. She married a man named Tommy Tjakamarra, who had come across the family while on his way northeast to Mikantji. Topsy had nobody to marry in her own group and Tommy had the right skin name. So they left to settle at Mikantji. Around this time, Piyiti's mother died."
"Waku died in about 1964. Soon after, a man named Lanti (or ""Joshua"") joined the group and married the three widows. He had lived at Balgo, but left there after getting into trouble with the Catholic missionaries. He came across the group while walking south across the desert. He took Waku's place as leader of the group. Nanu was his main wife. They had three children: Tamayinya, Yalti and Yukultji. Lanti also had another child, Walala, with Watjunka. Watjunka died sometime during the 1970s. When Lanti died around 1980, there were nine left in the group."
Members.
"The group was made up of two women and their seven children. All were born in the desert, so their exact ages are not known."
Story.
Life in the desert.
"The family lived travelling between temporary waterholes around Lake Mackay. They followed the clouds, as the presence of water dictated where they would go. They wore only small belts made out of hair. They carried wooden spears, spear-throwers and boomerangs for hunting. They also had an axe-head that Lanti had brought from Balgo. The group mostly ate lizards, witchetty grubs and bush plants. They also hunted rabbit, kangaroo, emu, goanna and snake."
"The family knew of places like Papunya, Balgo and Mikantji. They knew their relatives lived there. But Lanti had always kept the group away from those places. They had also heard stories about ""kartiya"" (whites), but did not understand who they were. The few encounters they had with modern objects (cars, planes) were associated with the supernatural. In an interview, Warlimpirrnga remembered, ""Joshua had told us about white men and motor cars. We knew there were non-Aboriginal people closing in around us. We didn't know what was happening."""
"To add to this, there were people who knew this family were still living in the desert. These included Topsy and Freddy West. They and their families all moved to Kiwirrkurra in 1983. Other locals would sometimes see campfires in the distance at night and footprints in the sand and knew they belonged to a group wandering the desert. The territory's welfare department were also said to have known about this particular group as early as 1962, and anthropologists working with the Pintupi during this time would often hear about these people."
"The father, Lanti (or ""Joshua""), died sometime around 1980. He died at Kuwarla, at the northern end of Lake Mackay. As is customary, the family moved away from the area in mourning. They travelled south, hoping to find some relatives."
Making contact.
"The encounter that led to the group leaving the desert happened on 13 October 1984. Warlimpirrnga and Piyiti were out hunting. They were at Lake Mackay, about two days walk from where their family was camped. They saw smoke coming from a campfire to the south. It was at Winparku, a waterhole between Kiwirrkurra and Kintore. A man named Pinta Pinta and his two sons were setting up an outstation there. After dark, Warlimpirrnga came close to the group. They were clothed and sitting next to a four-wheel drive. They drew water for Warlimpirrnga from a pump."
"Warlimpirrnga was scared. He was also angry, because these strangers were sitting on the land of his ancestors. They were in fact related, but didn't know each other. Warlimpirrnga knew only about his relatives from what his mothers had told him of them. They had an argument, and Pinta Pinta became frightened. Each thought the other was a featherfoot (sorcerer). When the man's son fired a shot from a rifle, Warlimpirrnga ran off. He took his family north, deep into the desert for safety. This was their first encounter with other people in 20 years."
"Meanwhile, Pinta Pinta and his family drove west through the night to Kiwirrkurra. He told everyone they had seen a featherfoot man. But when he described the man to them, Freddy West said he thought it was Warlimpirrnga. The next day, the elders met and decided to find the group and bring them in. On 15 October, a team of seven Pintupi and Charlie McMahon, the community co-ordinator, went out to Winparku. Together they followed the group's tracks across the desert in two four-wheel drives. On the second night, they could see the family's campfire in the distance. The next day, McMahon had to go back. His friend, Geoff Toll, drove up to continue the search with the others. They found the family the next morning, on 18 October. They had tracked them north for to Maruwa, a waterhole near Lake Mackay."
"On first seeing Toll, a white man, Warlimpirrnga remembers, ""I couldn't believe it. I thought he was a devil, a bad spirit. He was the colour of clouds at sunrise."" Yalti thought the white man was a spirit sent to punish her for something she had done wrong. The family were very scared. They tried to run and hide from the trackers. Warlimpirrnga tried to attack them, but Freddy West was able to calm him by showing him how they were related. The trackers gave the family jam from a tin and pieces of chocolate to eat. They convinced the family to come with them to Kiwirrkurra. They told them that there was lots of food and that water came out of pipes. Yalti said that this concept was unbelievable to them."
After contact.
"When they got to Kiwirrkurra, the family saw their relatives again for the first time in over 20 years. They were angry at them for leaving them behind and not coming to find them. When they saw Topsy, her brother and sister were so angry that they hit her. After a few days, Takariya was married off to Freddy West. It was a gesture between the two groups."
Impact.
"The meaning of the event was understood in many different ways. Agencies serving Aboriginals thought the group's discovery would help them in the debate about indigenous land rights. Fred Myers, an anthropologist who was invited to Kiwirrkurra to study the new group, argues that the event became a part of the Pintupi's struggle to get back their autonomy, which they had lost when they first came out of the desert to settle at Papunya. He argues that their main goal was to maintain the new people's ability to govern their own lives."
News.
"Before news of the group's discovery spread, the leaders of Kiwirrkurra worked to protect the privacy of the family members. They also wanted to protect them from the same kind of shame or teasing they had experienced themselves coming out of the desert many years before."
"One of the first people to be told about the event was the Aboriginal Affairs minister, Clyde Holding. His department wanted to use the group's story in the campaign for Aboriginal land rights. Holding gave the story to ""The Herald"", a newspaper from Melbourne. In exchange, the newspaper agreed not to tell anyone where the group was. The story was first reported on the newspaper's front page on 24 October, with the headline claiming it had ""found the lost tribe"". The news caused a sensation, and instantly made headlines across the country. They became popularly known as the ""Pintupi Nine"" or the ""Last Nomads"". The family themselves, however, would not tell their own story until much later in life."
hold on.
That's okay.
"Okay, um,"
I.
"Okay,"
"um, I don't know,"
"are you in your thirties,"
"or,"
"No,"
"I, I'm twenty-three."
"Oh, okay."
Uh-huh.
Well then I can tell you that roles have changed.
I'm thirty-eight
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
and they changed quite a bit.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I,"
"this was my twentieth high school reunion, in Chicago."
Uh-huh.
"And basically, um, the choices, I mean, you know,"
you probably heard that in the fifties women liked to stay home and all that.
"Right,"
uh-huh.
"That's kind of, um, the opposite of what it was in the sixties and early seventies."
Right.
"It was sort of just to um, go protest,"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, just, everybody be damned and live with some one,"
"and, you know,  social morals were a little bit lacking."
"Uh-huh,"
And she really enjoys it.
She likes the quiet that you have at that time of the night
"and, uh, and, uh, she's, uh, she just started a new job at a different hospital, closer to where she lives"
Uh-huh.
and she's really enjoying herself.
She really likes it.
"Well, that's great."
"Well, good luck to you in pursuing your nursing degree."
Oh thanks
Hope you'll like it.
Yeah.
"Do you plan on staying in, in the Dallas area?"
"Um, I'd like to come back to Dallas."
"Right now I'm in Utah, of course."
"Oh, uh-huh"
"So, um,"
"but, my family's there,"
"so,"
"yeah,"
I'd like to go back.
"Yeah,"
"uh, I think Texas, San Antonio in particular, has got a large, uh, base of hospitals."
"Uh, I don't know about Dallas."
I think Dallas is pretty scattered.
Are you in San Antonio?
"No,"
"I'm, I'm in Dallas"
"Oh, okay."
but I'm originally from San Antonio
Um.
"and they've got large medical, uh, center down there."
They've got the U T Health Science Center out there also.
"Let me see,"
Houston's north.
Yeah?
Okay.
Dallas is south.
"Oh, okay,"
all right.
"Well, that sounds pretty good."
"Does, uh,"
"I guess the weather,"
does that stay pretty constant there
"or,"
"It's, it's gets cold at night, and then warm in the afternoons."
Yeah?
"Probably seventies, eighties in the afternoon."
"Okay,"
"well, that's pretty temperate."
"Yeah,"
that's not too bad.
"But, uh, yeah,"
"have you done, uh, any other boating then"
"or,"
"No,"
"I hadn't done any in a uh, lately,"
"but that's all,"
"I used to uh, have a friend that owned, his daddy owned a boat shop."
Yeah?
"And we used to, when I was in high school, we used to go out, go boating every day just about."
"Oh, that's great."
"Yeah,"
"I,"
And we had a different boat every day.
Everybody
Yeah.
Yep.
That would have to be a blast.
"Yeah,"
"it really was, it was great."
"What,"
"well, you went out from Texas up in, into that area?"
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
"We went, uh, we took the southern route and went, went through, uh, uh, the Grand Canyon, again"
"and we stopped at, uh, uh, Las Vegas for a couple of nights, and then, uh, went into Malibu in California over on the coast."
Yeah.
"And then we went up the, the Big Sur Highway all the way up to San Francisco. And, uh, and then cut across through the wine country. And then went down to, to, uh, Sequoia National Park."
Okay.
"Oh, wow."
"Okay,"
"Big Sur Highway, that's, uh, where you're pretty much in view of the ocean almost all the time aren't you?"
"Oh, yeah."
"Okay, um,"
do you have any pets now?
"Well, we don't right now,"
no.
"We've, uh,"
"I grew up with, uh, with pets."
"My folks and I always had a dog and a cat,  some,  birds,"
Yeah.
"but, uh, right now we don't have anything."
"Oh, okay."
"Um, that,"
What about you?
"a matter of choice, or compulsion?"
"and so,"
"Oh, yeah."
Right now it's terrible isn't it?
"It's, yeah, it's really bad."
Yeah.
"But, uh, it's going pretty well"
"and I've got a real good plan mapped out here,"
so.
Uh-huh.
I also like long-term Christmas club you know.
"I used to belong to a Christmas club,"
last year I didn't.
Uh-huh.
"Then, so then, naturally, Christmas comes along"
"and that puts you behind too, you know."
"So this year, now I have them taking out fifty dollars a month out of my  checking account for my Christmas club."
"Oh that's,"
Yeah.
"So I figure, you know, that's going to help some."
That'll cover your gifts come Christmas time.
"That'll,"
"yeah,"
"Yeah,"
"right, you know."
"That'll be good,"
yeah
"most people are spending three or four months you know, at least, digging out after Christmas"
so.
"Right,"
right.
And I'm
"Yeah,"
"Last week going to the airport,"
I just hit a downpour
and I was on a highway going like eighty.
So I really did.
I mean I was soaking wet.
I thought I would drown in the seconds that it took me to pull over
Whoops.
"But it all dried out, you know. Didn't  take long when the sun came out"
Yeah.
but it was kind of funny.
I'm sure people around me really enjoyed it
"but,"
Oh. No I was just down in Austin last week
and the weather was pretty nice too.
"So,"
Oh
"and wasn't it pretty last week with the Bluebonnets and everything,"
"yeah,"
yeah.
"With the Bluebonnets out,"
yeah.
It really was.
Yeah
I decided that Austin is certainly someplace that I could handle living.
is Yeah.
A lot of people say that
and it's pretty far from where I live
I'm ready if you are.
Okay.
"Um, where do you stand, uh, on,"
"Well, I think that people should be allowed to have them."
"Especially  if they go hunting,"
"I think, I think because most kids don't have a car at college, the ones that do get taken advantage of"
"and, you know, there is just, I think it's just trouble waiting to happen."
"So I would advise they didn't, they didn't take a car"
"and, uh they didn't take a television"
"Is it,"
and they didn't take a refrigerator
"Maybe that,"
"Uh, I didn't do any of those, though,"
I feel less strongly about the T V and refrigerators.
"No,"
"I, I,"
"Yeah,"
"we didn't have,"
"Well, let me see,"
what have you seen lately?
"Well, uh, CITY SLICKERS, and STAR TREK FIVE."
FIVE?
Yeah
yeah.
"only, only five?"
Yeah.
I thought I'd better see that one before I go and see six.
"Well, no,"
didn't need to.
"No,"
I found that out
How about yourself?
I just saw the latest one.
How is it?
It was fantastic.
"Oh, I can't wait."
"Yeah,"
I have a personal computer at home.
It's an A T compatible.
I don't use it very much any more.
I used to use it quite a bit.
Uh-huh.
I also have a P C at work that I use as a terminal.
"I do some P C stand alone work on it,"
and I can transfer data back and forth between the P C and the main frame.
Uh-huh.
What about you?
Do you own a computer?
"Um, well I sort of own a computer."
"We have two P C at home,"
but neither one do we really own. Um.
Are you leasing them?
"No,"
"both of them are sort of work related,"
"and,"
Loaners from work?
"Yeah,"
"that's the nicer way, right."
Do you work for T I?
"No,"
no.
"Um, I, actually I'm doing consulting right now because I just had a baby,"
"and my husband's working at Bell Labs,"
"but he's really from France,"
and these computers actually are from France.
What brand are they?
One of them's a Compaq
Uh-huh.
it's a three eighty-six
"Yeah,"
"it, it, it was heavy when we were there though."
Yeah.
"I didn't see any boats there, though."
"Not, not, not too many, no."
"But, uh, no,"
I just got back from a weekend.
"We went and, uh, had a, kind of a picnic in the woods type thing."
"It was pretty nice,"
"but, uh, no, I, I have, uh, I had a boat last summer that I took out, a catamaran that I do, did a lot of sailing on and stuff."
Yeah?
"That's a lot of fun,"
"but, uh, my parents are pretty big sailors, too,"
they're kind of into it.
"Uh, all we, all we have up here mostly bass boats."
"Oh, yeah,"
"I guess it's pretty, uh, fishing's a pretty big thing, huh?"
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Lot of, lot of fishing going on up here."
Yeah.
All right.
"So, where about in Texas is that?"
Is that centrally located
"or,"
"It's, uh, well,"
you ever heard of Lufkin?
"Uh, no,"
"what, what major city is nearby?"
Houston.
"Okay,"
and that's south or north of there or something?
"Uh, in fact, I'm in the middle of a project right now making a bed for my son."
Um. What kind of
"It's, uh,  It's, uh, it's, uh, plywood, uh, face, I guess."
pine?
But I cut it out in the shape of a crayon box
"and then I painted, uh, about eight different, uh, colors, uh, you know,"
"the crayons that are sticking up, it will be the headboard"
Uh-huh.
I guess he's young.
"and then,"
yes
He's about five and a half years old.
"Oh, he'll be delighted."
"Oh, yeah."
Uh-huh.
Now I just have to finish it though.
"I got, uh, it got delayed for a little bit and, uh, because of work"
"and now, uh, I've got to jump back in and finish the,"
"because I've got it all cut out,"
"it's all, uh,"
I've done most of the coloring
but I've got to go a second layer with the yellow.
Did you do it with a jigsaw
"or do you have powered, you know, a,"
"Uh, yeah."
"Uh, I did, uh, jigsaw, uh, and the, uh, regular straight saw for some of it."
Um.
So yeah.
"to do the, uh, the turn cut."
"Uh, how about yourself?"
"Well I'm, I am interested in woodworking."
I don't have lots of tools.
Uh-huh.
"and the, the, the, third daughter fell in love with, uh, uh, Vermont."
Vermont.
"So,"
So they wanted to make their homes there.
"Yeah,"
that's where they've gone to make their homes.
My goodness.
"Are they, are those two married?"
No.
"They, uh, just working up there or going to school or what?"
"Well, uh, let's see,"
"yeah,"
"I guess you'd say J R is working, going to trying to go to school."
Uh-huh.
I wish to God he would go back.
"Oh, they do. Especially if they, if they're meant to, I think."
Yeah.
"Well, I certainly hope so."
"I mean, I've got a daughter that's a sophomore at U T"
"and I'm, I'm going to U T A right now myself"
so it's never too late.
Uh-huh.
"Well, it's, oh, I agree it's never too late."
Right.
"And,"
"Especially in some of these schools around here, I think they have about twenty percent older students."
"Yeah,"
"and when you're saying older, we're talking fifty up."
"Oh, yeah,"
I've seen some people that are really quite up there you know they look like in their very late sixties
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I prefer OPRAH WINFREY to DONAHUE"
"Oh, yeah."
"Well, she comes on later"
"and I usually have kids around so I don't end, end up watching that one is the only problem I have with it, I guess."
Oh.
"I did watch soap operas,"
"but I work full-time now and can't catch those anymore. Except when I'm home sick,"
Yeah
"and now when I watch them, I think, why did I ever watch those?"
That's right
They're stupid
Yeah.
So when I did watch them I was addicted to them every day.
Uh-huh.
But not anymore.
That can happen.
"So do you know of any other shows in the even, or something that you enjoy?"
"Oh, uh, tonight I'm looking forward to seeing GOLDEN GIRLS."
"Oh, that's always fun."
"Yes,"
I like that show.
Yeah.
"And if I can stay up late enough, I like to catch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE every now and then."
"Oh, uh-huh."
And right now we're watching a Penn State football game because that's where we live.
"Oh, yeah."
So
Uh-huh.
"It's exciting,"
"we're winning,"
so that's really exciting.
"Yeah,"
"those those are,"
"we'd, I've done one,"
I helped somebody do one of those before.
"Those are, those are, you know,"
you can buy them in kits
but we didn't do that way.
"But it's,"
No
I designed it from scratch and did it  did a pretty good job.
Yeah.
Those are nice.
"They're pretty forgiving, you know."
You can always tear stuff out and redo it.
"It's a,"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"That's not near, like building a house or anything"
"but,"
"Yeah,"
those are nice.
"Especially when you get done, you've got something, you know."
"I don't know,"
I like them.
You just sit down on on the deck and do whatever. Have  a barbecue
Yeah.
"I  I built it two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and, uh, a backrest and all that stuff."
"or,"
"I,"
"Yeah,"
that sounds nice.
"All done by yourself, huh?"
I had  a friend with a tractor who dug the pier holes
Yeah.
It's nice.
"Well, that's good."
"I, I have lived in Texas essentially all my life."
Uh-huh.
Around in Texas
"and, uh, I have traveled up in the northeast and around and have enjoyed it."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, I don't know,"
I'm not sure I would want to take on those winters.
"I'm getting older and, uh, not sure that's something I want to do."
I know.
"I live, uh, over in the Lake Highlands area if you're familiar with that."
"Uh, tell me where that is, uh,"
Okay.
"I, I probably do know,"
"Uh, you,"
but I don't know it by that name.
"This is pretty well where L B J and Audelia, Skillman cross."
Okay.
Sure.
"We're just north of, uh, White Rock Lake."
"Oh, okay,"
"yeah,"
I know that area.
"That's a nice area. Oh, that's quite a range."
"Well, we have some very nice homes here in this area."
"Uh, my particular,"
"I guess they want us to describe the area,"
"so, uh my particular area, the homes run anywhere from about sixty-five, eighty thousand dollars on up to probably half a million."
"Yes,"
"uh, the homes that were here earlier were smaller."
"and then, uh, and then you, and then you pass it on."
Yeah.
"It seems to be catching on, uh, slowly but surely, I guess"
Yeah.
"And, uh, my little boy has, watches a program that was really neat."
I sat and watched him.
You know the Barney?
"You know the little, I don't know if you know the little character Barney."
Uh-huh.
"They had one, uh, on that kind of, type of thing"
"and how children can, can do that"
and how to save water when you brush your teeth in water
and it's really caught on
and he's only four
and he's really caught on.
Uh-huh.
"Wow,"
that's cute.
"That's neat,"
yeah.
"When you,"
And keep the refrigerator door closed and that kind of thing.
He's really caught on
so that's really neat
"Well, when you start early, I guess,"
Hi.
How are you doing?
"What,"
I couldn't hear you?
"I said, how are you doing?"
I'm doing fine.
"I'm, uh, just editing a spreadsheet right now."
Really.
"It's not like driving a, a Winnebago or something."
"Oh, no"
"No,"
no.
"See, I'm not into station wagons and vans and things that people are really buying now"
and they go isn't that a nice van
"and I go, um."
"Not really, you know."
How about  a Greyhound bus
Nice.
Yeah.
Nice isn't the word I'd choose.
Maybe practical.
Yeah.
"I mean that, you know."
Isn't that a practical van.
There's some that are prettier than others
and
"yeah,"
"the new type is prettier than what their, they used to look like"
"but I sure don't think it's attractive, you know."
"It's not like, like driving a little sports car."
Yeah.
"It, it's very hard to find something practical that's also attractive."
Yeah.
I don't think that happens
"so, but I, I love mine,"
"so, and I, I bought it because I drove a friend's in Hawaii"
and I just went home
and I walked in
and I picked it out
And the same way with those calls.
"What is it,"
"oh M C I, M C I really does."
"Even when you tell them no, they keep calling back."
M C I
what's that?
M C I
it's the long distance telephone company.
"Oh, now see I, I really don't have much trouble with, I just say no thank you and hang up."
"Uh-huh,"
well they they won't take a no for an answer here for some reason.
They just keep calling back.
"I had a carpet service call up three times, all within in an hour,"
Uh-huh.
"but, I, uh, I do telemarketing,"
Uh-huh.
"so, uh, I'm very polite"
"and I just say no thank you, and say no thank you very politely"
"and I hang up and, don't bother me after that."
Uh
Yeah.
So I think the only thing that really bothers me is if when somebody contacts me
and they try to get information out of me.
Uh-huh.
"Like the Census Bureau, United States Census Bureau."
Oh yeah.
That bothered me.
Uh-huh.
I didn't feel they had a right to know how many bedrooms were in my house even.
Right.
That I think is my invasion privacy because it's the government
and I don't understand what their need to know is.
"But he's in a box, right?"
"No,"
"no,"
"no,"
"in fact, it's funny."
"He never did, does come in out of a box, I don't think."
"Yeah,"
he was just kind of walking around.
Didn't he used to?
Not really.
He was always in the box before.
Oh.
"Oh, that's, yeah, that's, okay."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
that's what I was thinking.
"Well, do you do any recycling?"
"Uh, we do here."
"Uh, see, what do we recycle?"
"We, they recycle,"
they have bins
Yeah.
"and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and, uh, plastic bottles"
and I think that's all they have.
Oh.
What about you guys?
"Well, we, uh,"
"there is a lot of things that you can recycle down here, although the only thing I guess I wind up recycling religiously is, uh, aluminum cans."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, we've got a, we've got a couple of different things, uh, places, uh,"
they're like unattended aluminum can smashers
"And you can go up there and, and, uh, redeem,"
"I, we're, we're new to Iowa"
"so that's something that I hadn't, you know, looked into before."
"But that's one way to sort of get money and still recycle, I guess."
"Yeah,"
"I know a lot of places, they, uh, uh,"
Okay.
"Okay,"
I guess we're ready to start.
"Well, I guess, what part of what part of the country do you live in?"
"I'm in Dallas, Texas."
"Oh, okay."
What about yourself?
"Well, I'm also in Dallas."
Okay.
"The reason that I ask is the two conversations I've had, have been out of state."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, have you always lived here in Dallas"
"and,"
"No,"
I've lived here for almost five years now.
I see.
"And I'm a, uh,"
"before that I was at school in Rochester, New York"
and I'm originally from Boston.
"Oh, well, you are seeing quite a different climate and quite a different neighborhood."
"That's right,"
but I like it.
You probably have enjoyed getting away from the snow.
"Well, I missed it at first,"
but now I go back there
and I'm a real wimp about the cold
So I like it here.
"You know, if, if you really wanted a gun, you, you could make one. Uh,"
Uh-huh.
"And I think if they want one, they're going to get one."
"Oh, you know"
You know.
true.
That's true.
"The bad guys are, you know,"
"like I say, if they want a gun they're going to find out somehow to get one."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"it's,"
"yeah,"
"I mean,"
yeah
"there's, there's no way to stop, uh, stop anybody from getting a gun."
"Uh, I think there should be more control as, like, uh, like maybe waiting periods and things like that, you know, uh,"
"Well I agree with you on that because I know, uh,"
in fact I had bought my son a rifle like for a Christmas present one time.
Uh-huh.
And for a rifle there's no waiting.
There wasn't anyhow.
Now there might be now.
Yeah.
"But there wasn't anything for, you know, rifles and things like that."
Uh-huh.
"I guess  it was just handguns that there was a, some kind  of a waiting, you know, two weeks while they checked you out or something."
Sure.
Yeah.
Right.
"But, uh, most of these people that's got these guns that's going around, you know, robbing people and shooting people,"
"They aren't testifying really in their own words,"
Right.
"Yeah,"
"I can remember, uh, friends of Daddy ..."
There we go.
Okay.
"Well, uh, what do you think about taxes,"
do you think we're paying too much?
Yes and no.
"Income tax, no."
"I, uh, I look at it this way, uh, you've got to pay for the privilege of living here."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, being a, uh, a rec vehicle owner,"
"well, in fact, I live in a motor home."
I'm a what they call a full timer
"and, uh, it burns gas like crazy."
I only get seven miles to the gallon.
I really resent this fact that they keep adding on gasoline taxes
"and they call it, uh, uh,"
"what's the word they use,"
"anyway, a, a luxury tax."
Yeah.
"They add it on on to tires and gasoline, cigarettes, liquor."
It doesn't bother me any because I've quit drinking
and I quit smoking.
"So, that doesn't bother me"
but I don't think it's fair.
Yeah.
"It's too, um, um, it's attacking just certain people."
How true.
Even with the gasoline tax.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"I think that's,"
Which I think they have to do on rifles and things now too.
"I think there is some, something like that."
Uh-huh
"Anyhow, here, out here in California, I think there is now."
Yeah.
Yeah
"But,"
"I'm not sure,"
"I'm not really sure but, what uh, the gun laws in Pennsylvania are like."
Uh-huh.
Now we don't have guns because we don't go hunting or anything like that.
No.
Uh-huh.
"But like I say, my son, he's, he's always had a,"
"like, I think his first little rifle that we got him was like he twelve or thirteen years old."
Uh-huh.
"But he's always, he went to the, to the school to learn how to shoot it."
He goes to the pistol range
and and the rifle range to shoot them.
"He likes to go to that, uh, shotgun thing where you shoot at those, uh"
"Oh, yeah."
"The skeets, you mean?"
"yeah,"
right
He likes to do that you know
Uh-huh.
"But, uh  I don't know."
Yeah.
"I think they should try to control it and everything, you know."
"But as far as just banning it completely, there, that's not going to happen."
Yeah.
If it could just be spread out a little bit.
Right.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Yeah.
"It has really been nice here, uh,"
"we are supposed to have some rain this weekend,"
but I don't know if we'll get it or not.
A lot of times in our area the weather forecast has missed us.
"The, the weather they forecast for our area seems to go right past us and misses us. Just by, well not too many miles."
Uh-huh.
Are you in an agricultural area?
"Yes,"
uh-huh.
"We have,"
"Well, I know the I know the weather is very important for people who make their living off of, off of the land."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Yeah.
We have quite a few farmers.
"We, we live out in the country."
"We are on a farm,"
but we are not a farming person
Uh-huh.
"Uh, we have a garden."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, but we are not farmers."
Huh.
"Well, you know there are some disadvantages to being down south."
Uh-huh.
"And that is, it gets so hot that, you know, a lot of things die during the Summer from the heat."
"And, uh, there's a lot of things that I see that are so obviously wrong. That you would think it would be easy to correct."
Uh-huh.
Right.
But the system doesn't allow for the corrections
Uh-huh.
How about you?
"Well, that's interesting."
"I have a sister who used to live in Kennesaw, Georgia."
"Oh, yes."
"And, uh, she has a young boy. Actually has two boys now but only had one when she was there."
And she complained quite a bit about their school system there.
Yes.
"And,"
And Cobb County is better than the county I'm in.
Right.
She was in Cobb County.
Right.
"I'm,"
I can't really say much about the schools up here.
I really don't come from here
Uh-huh.
I'm only up here temporarily on an internship
"but  uh, I live in Orlando, Florida usually."
Okay.
"And the schools down there, from what I know, are not bad."
They're pretty good.
"Well, that's great."
"But I know that in some, I know in a lot of rural areas they're not that good."
Uh-huh.
"For example, I have a brother in North Carolina"
"and he says the schools there are, are incredibly bad. Uh, just terrible."
"Well, I feel that we're way behind."
Really.
Yeah.
What have you been to lately?
"Um, let's see."
"Well, uh, this is almost, sort of funny."
"I was just um,"
"friend and I went to see OUT FOR JUSTICE which is Steven Segal, because, uh, we're both big karate fans."
Yeah.
"Oh, yeah."
So we wanted to see what this is like.
"And, uh, impressed with actually."
Is that right?
"Yeah,"
"I wasn't, I mean, I've seen his other movies,"
and I just think he's pretty good.
Yeah.
"But, uh, this movie,"
I'm convinced now he can act.
Uh-huh.
How's his karate?
"Oh, his, his, his karate is pretty good."
I think in this one it wasn't so good.
"I generally, um,"
"movies like that scare me, though."
"I'd be just fine without them, because, you know, kids come running out wanting to beat each other up."
"Well, well they do,"
they get
Fighting.
"I remember when we used to go to see, well I remember when GRAND PRIX came out when I was a kid, and some other movies like that."
We wanted to jump in the cars and race.
Right.
And I suspect today what they see is bound to be what they want to do when they get out of it.
"and,"
"Yeah,"
that's easy.
"I always like to have that, too."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Everybody seems to like that, too."
"I know,"
I don't think I've ever met anyone that didn't.
"No,"
everybody likes that.
Yeah.
"And, then, uh, if you have a nice big roast that you can throw in the oven, then you can put your potatoes and carrots or whatever else all in there, you know. Especially if a pork roast."
"Oh, yeah."
"That's what I love, with my"
"I like it, too."
"I do, too."
"And, uh, other than that, in fact, I'm just thinking of what next weekend when the Super Bowl's on"
Uh-huh.
I've asked a couple people to come over
"and I just, uh, had been thinking what to have for that"
Yeah.
"Well, have you had any good ideas yet?"
No
not yet
"Oh, okay."
"No,"
"and I, you know, I don't want to have to come away from the T V."
I want something that I can just take them and serve them while they're sitting in front of the T V.
Yeah.
"You know, so, I'll think of something, just that we can munch on over there, you know."
Yeah.
uh-huh.
"So, which I've been doing."
"Well, that's a good way to, to make a little extra money."
Uh-huh.
"Well, this is another way that I'm making a little extra money"
"so that was, you know, nice that I tripped over this opportunity"
and you're actually my first call.
"Oh, really?"
Yeah.
Oh.
"I had not, uh, done"
"I, I guess today  today's my first day that I could  even do it."
"Well, have you called?"
Oh.
"Oh, it is?"
"Yeah,"
"you beat me to the punch, here"
"Oh, well, that, that's nice you know."
"I, I was about to call to get, to see if I could get on with somebody,"
so
Uh-huh.
so that was great.
Yeah.
Well I guess that's about all I can talk to about budgets.
"When I was working, I, uh, bought a bond a month out of my, you know,"
they automatically took it out of my  out of my payroll.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"I take, have some money taken it and put in a Four Oh One K,"
"So, what sort of car are you interested in getting next?"
"Well, actually, I love the car I have."
I have a Chrysler LeBaron convertible.
"and it has not, really. Which is a bit of a disappointment."
"But it is very warm here, which is typical for this part of the, time of the year."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
How about
"I think you are, I think you are earlier than we are, as a rule, aren't you?"
"Your, your, your growing Summer starts a lot earlier than ours."
"It starts in, uh, March as a rule."
Uh-huh.
"See that is quite a bit,"
we are just beginning.
"People are, have got their gardens in, a lot of them now."
We could still have a frost.
"Really,"
this late?
Uh-huh.
Could you have snow?
"Uh, probably not."
"But we have had, we have had a frost as late as, as in June."
"Oh, well, we do not have that problem"
Early June.
"So, but we have also had nice weather. An unusually, uh, nice Spring."
It is almost like an early Summer for us.
"Oh, that is nice."
Uh-huh.
"We could use a little more rain, I believe."
"Uh, well, we will be glad, I will be glad to give you some of ours"
Uh
"Usually we get it in, in great quantities in April and May."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
And then it stops for three months.
Right.
"It's just, it's, it's ridiculous."
"She, She's an emotional victim"
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"it, it's terrible, you know"
"and,"
"And, you know, the, like you say, the cops are out doing the work day by day have got to have a lot of frustration when they see all their work, basically go out the window."
Yeah.
"Oh, that,"
"oh, man, I, I couldn't be a cop for that, for that very reason, you know, because they do."
"The, the criminal gets right back out"
"and, you know, the cop's just got to go back and, and do his thing all over again, because so many of the crimes are, are done by repeat offenders."
"Yes,"
they are.
"It's,"
"Well, that's about five minutes,"
"so unless you've got something else, well,"
Yeah.
No
It's a pleasure talking with you.
"All right,"
"Ron, we'll see you later."
"Okeydoke,"
good-bye.
Bye-bye.
Okay.
Tell me about your home.
"Well, it's an older home."
It was made back in the early sixties.
It's a pier beam house.
Huh-uh.
Do you have it there?
I've I think I've seen it around.
"Yes, sir."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Well, I love Mexican food myself."
"Oh, do you?"
Yeah.
But you go ahead now
"Oh, we, we do too."
"We, uh, we enjoy Mexican food."
I'm just not impressed with the quality of it.
"It's just primarily the price that's, uh, satisfying at this point."
"But the kids,  seem to enjoy it."
Is that right?
Uh-huh.
"Uh, and, uh, let's see."
"We've, uh, just recently discovered a super restaurant down here"
"but it's, uh, not part of a chain"
it's just an individually owned seafood restaurant.
"But the first one we've been to that, uh, I don't think there was anything on the menu, that, that any of us had"
"that was, uh, not just really super."
It's nice to find a place like that.
"Oh, boy that is wonderful."
Yeah.
"Well, I, I agree with you on that."
And I was really a seafood addict myself.
"I, I love crab meat in particular."
Um.
"I, uh, I can almost live on, on seafood and almost live on the crab meat if I had to."
"Oh, boy."
"Have you ever been to, uh, what is it, Original Book Binders in Philadelphia?"
and they put him on the scale
and he's up to ninety four now.
Oh.
"But he's not a real, he's not a real tall, uh, dog for a Golden Retriever."
"He's kind of stocky, shorter and stockier."
Um.
"But,"
Is he good with family?
He is.
"It's, uh, just me and my wife"
"and, uh, he's kind of our temporary substitute for having kids."
We treat him like our kid right now so he's spoiled rotten.
"Yeah,"
I can understand that
"Because I,"
Get away with that a little bit more with pets than you can with kids
Uh-huh.
How about you?
"Well, we have a cat who's also about four years old."
Oh.
"And he's our spoiled child right now, too"
Uh-huh.
And he also sheds a lot.
Yeah.
"But, we, uh, we hope to get a Golden Retriever someday."
"But we figure we'll get the kids and then the, the dog"
That's probably a good idea.
They're good though.
"Uh, have you ever had a Retriever before?"
"No,"
but my husband had one when he was growing up.
"Because I, I find that they're good around other animals like cats and other dogs."
So you do spend less time then?
Yeah
"because they don't want to know, they almost don't want to know us."
They want to be with their friends.
How old are your kids?
Are they married or what?
"Uh, yes,"
"I have, uh, two married, two and then two almost married"
"and the other two, I'm not sure."
"Well, Two two, two, uh, uh, for sure are single."
"Oh, boy, you have a lot of kids."
"Yeah,"
"we have, between the spouse and myself we have six."
"Oh, well, that's kind of nice, though."
"You you shouldn't be lonesome on a holiday, huh?"
Because I came with a split family
"and she had,"
"Well, no,"
there is so much of them are gone
and they're doing their own things
"and and a lot of times they, they've got, you know, uh when the holidays,"
"Well, that's true."
"They have to see their other parent, I guess too."
Yeah
"and sometimes they want to do their own thing,"
so sometimes it's just spouse and me.
I know.
"And, and you know what?"
What?
Sometimes that's okay.
I know
"Because,"
and the they like it all right.
Yeah.
"And, um, then sometimes we do something,"
"it has to be fast because they're on their way to school,"
"we do like Eggo waffles and stuff like that,"
but.
"Oh, uh-huh,"
yeah.
"Yeah,"
"so, I try to, uh,"
and sometimes we do eggs if I get up early enough to do that.
"I used to do them in the microwave,"
but they don't like that.
"Oh, do they get rubbery,"
"or,"
Um.
I've never tried it.
It it depends.
If you let them cook too long then they'll turn a little bit gray.
Uh-huh.
You can tell if they've gone to long because they'll turn a little bit gray
"and they will be a little harder,"
and I don't like that.
Yeah.
"So you have to just let it cook a little bit less than what it says in, if you have a microwave book,"
"but you cook it a little bit less and then let it sit with a, like a plate over the top."
Oh.
And let it steam.
Uh-huh.
"And then, and then stir it up."
Huh.
"Yeah,"
"Designed,"
"so we could pour concrete and support it with a, a nice firm four by four posts."
"And, uh and then the rest of it I just did."
Yeah.
"A, a contractor friend helped me, uh, with some of the, uh, foundation work"
"but, uh, it was pretty,"
it was about four or five hundred square feet.
The same size as the addition that I just put on
so.
Yeah.
"That's pretty, that's a good size deck."
Yeah.
"So, yeah."
"That's,"
"It's, uh, not that expensive."
"I think it cost me three dollars a square foot and, uh, you know, no less than that."
Yeah.
"That's not,"
"cost me about five hundred dollars, six hundred dollars all together."
"Yeah,"
that's good.
That's not bad at all.
"Didn't  have to,"
Yeah.
the wood may
"it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is, you know."
"To get, to get good lumber it costs,"
"I don't know about Dallas, but even in this little town, it's, it's not cheap at all."
I was surprised.
"I'd be surprised if it wasn't, uh, cheaper where you are."
It's probably more there.
"Well, yeah."
"and he said take it home and bring it back if you want to,"
and I never did.
I just went back and signed the papers
and I knew nothing about my car when I got it.
Nothing.
I didn't know how anything worked.
"Well, so it was a completely new experience for you."
And I'm sure you enjoyed every minute of it.
Yeah.
"And I've had it,"
it's almost three years actually.
"And I've, I still love it."
I put the top down everywhere I go.
I timed it when I first got it
and it took twenty I mean twenty seconds
"and so, I figured there was nowhere I was to late to go that I didn't have twenty more seconds."
Right.
So.
"And, and you couldn't get,"
how long does it take to go back up? About the same time.
"Twenty seconds,"
yeah.
That's all it takes.
"I mean, it's just a button, that's it."
"You  release it right at the top,"
"Yeah,"
so
so you don't have to  get out or anything.
"So you won't get,"
Yeah
and twenty seconds you probably won't get caught in anything too substantial.
"Well I did, actually."
"and then slowly but surely starts to creep up when they start to take lessons,"
but it's well worth it and everything.
"Yeah,"
"uh, yeah,"
I think it'll be neat.
"Be a, be a great experience really."
You still there?
"Okay,"
I thought I was cut off there.
"You know, I don't have much to say about drug testing."
"No,"
I can't think of anything else to say about that either.
So you've done this ten times?
Yeah.
Did you get the booklet on how to get the gifts and all?
"No,"
"I don't work for T I,"
so I get cash.
"Oh, okay."
I didn't know what they were going to do.
"They sent us a little booklet,"
"I just got it a week or so ago saying, you know, so many calls will be something a prize and everything."
Right.
Well that great.
Well what kind of cash?
I've forgotten what they going to do.
Hm.
Was it five dollars a call?
"Yeah,"
five dollars a call.
"Well, hope they follow through and everything."
Well technically we're not supposed to talk about the phone calls while we're on them
"I, I was pretty fortunate this Christmas"
"I didn't get in debt,"
so.
"Oh, that's good."
"I'm taking like, uh, sewing lessons to try to learn how to sew better than what I can"
Uh-huh.
so I won't have to go out and buy the ready-made clothes anymore.
"Oh, uh-huh."
It's so rare
you hear anybody doing that any longer
I know.
"I even bought myself a Surgery , you know,"
and I just love it.
I haven't learned everything to do on it yet
but I figure that will help me save you know.
Yeah.
"My, uh, roommate does sew some"
"and, and, uh, she hasn't sewed anything in a long time"
"but I, I'm sure that she could pick it up again."
My mother always sewed.
She tried to teach me when I was young but not interested
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Well, see, some people are, some aren't"
"because  I have some sisters, I have three sisters"
Yeah.
and none of those are really interested in sewing.
Yeah.
"But that's a real good way to save money, though by doing that."
"Yeah,"
"and then I can also, you know, do some crafts and sell those at garage sales."
"Uh-huh,"
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, I know exactly what you mean."
"We are fortunate or, uh, we are on a, where we are we get flooded, it floods below us behind us."
Uh-huh.
"But we are, uh, we are high enough that our house itself we never, you know, have had any problem like that."
"Oh, well, that is fortunate."
Yeah.
It is an old farm house
"and, uh, we really like it here."
Uh-huh.
"Well, I, I like it, I like it here."
"Uh, I, I grew up here."
I have lived other places
"and, and, but I, I did grow up here"
Uh-huh.
and this is very much home for me.
Uh-huh.
"And,"
It is nice down there.
"I, I, I liked it when we visited there."
I hope you visited during the winter.
Uh-huh.
"One of my, one of my theories is that you always go to warm places during the winter"
"and you go to cold, cool places, that, well, I go to cool places during the Summer if I can anyway."
Right.
Right.
That is the best time to go.
Yeah.
"and usually it has been when we have gone, it has been nice."
"It has been hot,"
"but it is, it is hot to me in the wintertime down there."
"Oh, sure."
"Yeah,"
do you?
"Yes,"
that is great.
"Yeah,"
it's fun.
"And then there's a new one that started out that I've caught a couple of times called GOOD AND EVIL, I think."
"Oh, I heard they just canceled that."
"Oh, really?"
I read in today's paper they just canceled that show.
It is a real different one.
"It's, uh, it's, it's different."
I guess I watch it more out of the uniqueness of it and the time that it comes on more than the fact that I have to see it.
"But,"
"Have you seen the show, it's, it's new this year, called HOME FRONT?"
"No,"
I haven't watched that.
"Oh, it's, it's really good."
"It's, uh, I think it's on like Tuesday nights from ten to eleven"
Uh-huh.
and it's set in post World War Two times
and it's about how the servicemen come home and readjust to civilian life here and the changes everyone's going through.
It's really interesting.
"Oh, yeah."
It's kind of like a a nighttime soap opera type thing.
Sounds neat.
"It is, it's a good, it's really well written."
Yeah.
"Is that on, what what station?"
"Uh, I don't even know, to tell you the truth"
"Oh, okay."
What other shows do you like?
"They don't get, you know,"
Huh-uh.
"and that,"
plus
and then we had a car expense like that same week.
"One of the cars died, you know."
All of this adds up
and that for savings really comes in handy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can see that.
"I can that,"
"I keep trying to say to her, Laura don't spend so much."
"What happens if something happens to a car, you know."
Right.
"Oh, well, nothing will happen."
Oh.
"All right,"
what type of things would you fix if you're having company come over?
"Well, I have a really great one that I make in the summertime because it's cool"
"and it's, uh, it's just really pretty easy."
It's pretty much dumping things in and stirring.
Uh-huh.
And I like that.
"Uh, the only thing you have to do is cook the rice that goes in, in it"
"and then I, you're supposed to do chicken,"
but I just use those little cans of chicken.
Uh-huh.
"And it makes it so much easier,"
"and so you dump the rice,"
you dump the chicken
"and then you put in fruit like pineapple and mandarin oranges and grape,"
"but, I mean, my mother and her sisters are always saying, uh, to my cousins and I, my female cousins,  you girls are so lucky because quote, unquote, you have all these choices, you know,"
Uh-huh.
"you went to school,"
"Right,"
uh-huh.
"you can do this,"
"you can do that,"
Uh-huh.
we couldn't do that then.
"And my cousins and I go, well why couldn't you"
"Yeah,"
"that's, that's why I say I feel, I feel really lucky right now, because I'm not married and because I don't have children."
"I'm out of school,"
"I'm twenty-three,"
"I can do anything I want to do, anything."
Uh-huh.
"And so, I mean even some days I'm looking for another job now,"
"but, and I get so depressed because, not because I can't find a job, but because I can't figure out what I want to do."
"And that's normal,"
"I mean,  I think that's the world today."
"And yeah,"
and I
"and I'm lucky though, because not a lot of people can sit there and go gee, I don't know what to do."
"I have so  you know,"
Right
that's
"not a lot of people,"
Yeah.
but it's depressing too.
"That's how, I mean,  What, I'm right now."
"What do you, what do you that you're,"
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
That's
"yeah,"
that's a hard thing about it.
"If, I mean, I I can't foresee myself getting married"
"but if, you know, if I ever wanted to have a kid, how could I work."
"I mean, I don't think I could trust somebody with my kid either."
"Unless it was a friend that, you know, did it in ounds like an airplane their house that I knew well."
"Oh, yeah."
That's true.
Yeah.
"I just, I couldn't do it I don't think."
"It would just rip me apart, I think"
I don't know.
Yeah.
Just not knowing.
"Yeah,"
"just besides the fact that, you know, your, when your child gets out of school at three o'clock and then has to wait."
"What do you usually wear to,"
"Well, let's see."
"It turns out that, uh,"
I work at TEKTRONIX
"and it's a very, uh, low key place as far as dress goes."
Uh-huh.
"You just wear, uh,"
let's see.
"When I first came here, I wore suits"
"but after a while I got, uh, found out that that wasn't all that important."
I'm an engineer.
"Oh, I see."
"And, uh, so, I get to wear just, uh, how shall I say it, uh, walking shoes as opposed to dress shoes and well walking, how shall I say it, kind of like Avia, uh, walking shoes, uh,"
Uh-huh.
"Oh, I think, I don't think so."
"I, I think that, uh, I think they've now just taken the attitude that, well, if it happens, if it,"
"because it, there a lot of things that, that, uh, um, like sports, you know."
It's a hundred meter.
"Oh, absolutely."
"And, uh, uh, but automobile races"
"if it,"
"I don't think they'd ever,"
it's still going to be the Indianapolis Five Hundred.
They're not going to ...
"Yeah,"
Yeah.
They're not going to change that to meters.
It will always be.
Yeah.
"And, and it, I, I don't think it, I don't, you know, I don't think, I don't think it's particularly bothersome because in reality, uh,"
"you, it's like troy ounces in ounces of gold."
"How many ounces of gold, you know."
Twelve.
"I was trying, I was trying to figure up gold content on something."
"It had, has, uh, gold plated, uh, header."
"And, and they're trying to think of what's a Troy ounce."
Yeah.
There's twelve troy ounces to the pound.
Yeah.
"Now that makes, you know."
Yeah.
"And, and is that going to change too?"
"Well, I mean, and, and then there's a metric ton"
and then there's a ton.
But what's a metric ton?
"Uh,"
"and, and, when you turn, When you turn sixty-five why then you pay the tax on it"
"And then, at a took that away as far as being,"
and the tax is a lot less.
Yeah.
"But in the mean time you've got your money tide up in a low, relatively low interest bearing investment."
"I mean, it's not making ten, fifteen percent like a business is today."
Huh-uh.
"Uh, me I'm a firm believer in that if you got it spend it."
"Well, you can come over to my house and spend it"
"Well, you, well, do you, do you need some help spending yours?"
I wish I had some to spend.
No.
No.
I just don't have any.
"Oh, uh-huh."
"Well, that's my problem too."
"I'm, I'm trying to figure out from one payday to the next whose going to be the lucky one this month that's going to get paid."
Yeah.
That's the way it goes
"Well, I guess we probably talked just about long enough."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Uh, let me ask you something."
Did you get a catalog or something from these people?
Yes.
You did?
Uh-huh.
"I've, everybody I've talked to has received one"
but I haven't gotten mine.
"Uh, I don't know."
"Um, well, anyway Ellen, it was nice talking to you."
You too.
and they have nothing to gain one way or the other.
"So if they say a certain way, then why not believe them."
Right.
"And I don't know all the details on that,"
"but I certainly think that we've come up with a good idea with the, the the students coming into the jury."
Yeah.
And I don't think that it would be such a bad idea even if the judge didn't have the final say.
Uh-huh.
Do you have any?
"Yes,"
we do have a pet.
"We have a, a dog that we got from the, uh,"
"well, we call it the S P C A."
"It's the, uh, from an animal shelter."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, he'd come in there as a stray."
All right.
"Uh, he's a Pomeranian and Sheltie cross."
Yeah.
"Uh, well, he was very well trained when we got him."
"Uh, he's,"
"Oh, that's good."
"You don't often find that,"
I don't think.
"No, uh,"
"we suspect that he was hurt in an accident, you know, got away from somebody traveling through, and hurt in an accident because a dog that looks as good as he does and is trained as well is someone that has lost him and not have been able to locate him."
Right.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, if they were local people, they would have been able to find him."
Sure.
"There's a,"
"okay, uh,"
"Well, you know, these guys that gambled high lost big you know."
Yeah.
That's true.
"And, uh I'm insulating myself from that problem."
Exactly what happened to them.
I'm building my own house.
"Oh, that's nice."
"And as I look out the window of my trailer, I can envision all the insulation that's going up today"
"Oh, really."
Yeah.
Are you doing it yourself?
Yeah.
Wow.
I used to be a builder.
"Oh, that's nice."
And I retired about five years ago and  started college.
"Oh, I see."
Huh.
And now I'm a college educated builder
"There's still no work, you know."
Yeah.
"So, uh, you know, I decided this summer that, uh, you know, we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials"
so I did.
That's great.
"And, uh, see the, the, the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home."
is that so?
I didn't know that.
You can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house
but you can't borrow the money to build your own.
Well that sounds kind of dumb.
"Well, it's to protect the, the banks from guys that say yeah I want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home"
Uh-huh.
"and if, they should pay for it with their life."
Right.
"When you're saying as far as the appeal, uh, procedure was concerned."
Yeah.
"We just have the case,"
"I'm, I'm sure you've probably heard of Marion Berry."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, his last appeal was, was denied two days before his sentence was up"
"Oh, really."
"So, I mean, his appeal was denied"
and two days later he got out of jail For cocaine possession.
"It, uh,"
Yeah.
"But, uh, that was absurd"
"There is never, there was no reason  the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence."
"I know that, that"
Uh-huh.
"And, I don't know."
"Uh, what would you do to change it? To make it better?"
"Well, uh, the, the only I can, I you know,"
"the, appeal procedure is the only thing I can possibly think of."
"Uh, like I said, as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence, that's absurd."
There's no way that could work.
"Oh, yeah."
"I, I, I don't agree with that at all."
"Uh, but,"
Imagine the guilt that person would have.
I mean  burned out.
"Oh, exactly."
"There's  there's no possible way that you could, uh, you know, feel good about yourself."
Exactly.
Right.
you could probably do that.
"Or is it,"
I've talked about adding at least one more room and definitely adding another bath on.
Yeah
"I would think so if you only have one bathroom for three bedrooms,"
that's tough.
"Do you not, like, have a half bath."
Not even a half bath.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's rough.
The house that I used to live in had one bath and a half.
And that was even just with two people.
That was a pain.
"The only thing that saves it, with the schedule I work and the schedule my wife works, we're getting ready to go to work at totally different times. So that. It's not like we're tripping over each other in the morning."
That's good.
Really.
That could account for a lot of marital problems I think
You get to know each other very well if you have to share a bathroom
It doesn't work if you're trying to shave and she's trying to put her eyeliner on
"and,  you're both fighting over the mirror."
No.
That's right.
It does not make for a happy situation.
That's true.
"Well, do you have any children?"
I've got one.
One child.
And they enjoy where they're living?
"We'll,"
he's nine months old.
"Oh, so he doesn't know, right."
Yes.
"And then,"
You save a lot.
Right.
"If, if, if, if,"
"and you need to be very careful,"
"if the loan is set up to have bi, they call it a yuppie loan, if it's set up for bimonthly payments."
Right.
"If you,"
because you'll save fifteen to seventeen years off the end of the loan.
Right.
"I'm sorry, seven to nine years off the end of the loan."
Right.
"And there are, there is a local firm that'll actually,"
"if, if,"
"like in my situation, I don't have that, because the loan was not available."
"I can have,"
this firm will pick up my loan for a six hundred fifty dollar fee.
"So I can cut that much off the end of,"
but I'm not interested because we're moving out of the house next year.
Oh really.
Yeah.
"But, uh, those are all great."
Uh-huh.
"The, the interesting thing, we're getting ready to have a house built"
Uh-huh.
"it's not, a lot of the firms that offer,"
"mortgage loan firms, aren't offering, um, that loan."
Uh-huh.
"You can ask and you can wheel and deal,"
but it's not as open as it should be.
Yeah.

"Thomas Ellis was the first European settler in the area known today as Penticton, British Columbia, Canada. He was the biggest cattle baron in the South Okanagan area."
"Thomas Ellis was born in Ireland but left for British Columbia when he was nineteen. In January 1865, Ellis sailed for British Columbia and arrived in Victoria in March 1865. It was in the late 1860s that Ellis began to accumulate large acreages in the South Okanagan. His original holding had 642.35 acres and was located on a large piece of land in modern-day Penticton."
"Ellis returned to Ireland and married Wilhemina Wade on February 10, 1873. Ellis and his wife would have nine children together. Wilhemina would become well known for her nursing skills in the Okanagan."
"After his marriage, Ellis returned to the Okanagan and by the 1890s he had 20,000 heads of cattle and 31,000 acres of land from the South Okanagan all the way to the Canada–US border. Mining companies provided a good market for his beef. Although Ellis claimed all of that land as his own, much of the land that his cattle roamed on was not actually owned by him, but he built up his empire based on grazing rights."
"In the 1890s, Ellis arrived in the Mission Valley and purchased a pioneer ranch. Ellis' ranch had three stacks of premium hay in the yard. When he brought up his cattle he found two-thirds of his premium hay had burned. In the following investigation and trial, Arthur Booth (A.B.) Knox was found guilty of arson, although there was much doubt from early Kelowna residents as to whether he actually burned the hay."
"Ellis later entered into a partnership with Captain Thomas Shorts and he invested in Shorts' next business venture; a large ferry boat which was to be called the ""Penticton"". The boat only lasted a short time before Ellis and Thomas Shorts sold the boat to Leon Lequime for five thousand dollars in 1892."
"In the early half of the 1890s, Ellis started to think about selling his empire. He entered an agreement with the Penticton Townsite Company. he sold his land and it became part of the City of Penticton. Ellis also sold some of his land to Southern Okanagan Land Company who then sold to the Okanagan Falls Townsite for development."

Regional champions and, from 1925 onwards, runners-up played a series of playoff matches for the right to compete in a final game for the national championship. On 28 January 1900, a national association, the Deutscher Fussball-Bund (DFB) was founded in Leipzig with 86 member clubs.

They soon discover that Arthur's flamboyant redundancy clashes with Edmond's mediocre melodramatic style as they each develop increasingly ridiculous scenarios for the story. They are joined by Arthur's cleaning lady, also an aspiring writer, whose suggestions seem to be the most promising, but they too eventually bog down in banality."

He became director of the theater in 1888.
"The foyer of the premises were used as an art gallery. The artists Jules Chéret, Ferdinand Bac and Théophile Steinlen had their first one-person shows there while the main room was being used for the Théâtre d'Application."
"The original purpose evolved. The theater at 18 rue Saint-Lazare became known as ""La Bodinière"" and began to be used for different purposes."
La Bodinière's audience came to include members of the Parisian upper class and intelligentsia.
"Starting in 1890, Bodinier began to put on ""matinées-causeries"", where well-known literary figures gave talks."
He also staged plays and shadow shows.
A popular format was a combined lecture with a recital that illustrated the topic.
Charles Bodinier abandoned the theater in 1902 and left philosophically to spend in a quiet retirement in the suburbs.
He died in 1911 aged 67.

"SS ""Calabria was a passenger and cargo steamship. AG Weser built her for Norddeutscher Lloyd. She was launched as D/S ""Werra and completed in 1922. (""D/S"" stands for ""Dampfschiff"" in German as ""SS"" stands for ""steamship"" in English.)"
"In 1935 she was bought by Flotte Riunite Cosulich-Lloyd-Sabaudo Navigazione Generale, who renamed her Calabria. In 1937 she was sold to Lloyd Triestino."
"In June 1940 the UK seized her and placed in the management of the British-India Steam Navigation Company. In December 1940 she was torpedoed and sunk. When she sank, all of her 360 passengers and crew lost their lives. The Ministry of War Transport (MoWT) was going to rename her Empire Inventor, but she was sunk before this had been done."
"The Allied Powers seized numerous NDL ships either during the First World War as prize ships or afterwards for war reparations. In the 1920s NDL replaced them with a new fleet from Bremer Vulkan, AG Vulcan Stettin and AG Weser. The first of the new ships were delivered in 1922; ""Werra"" among them."
"""Werra"" was one of a series of six sister ships that AG Weser built for NDL. ""Werra"" and were completed in 1922; , and in 1923 and in 1924."
"""Werra"" had two three-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines and twin screws. Between them her two engines were rated at 604 NHP. ""Werra"" was equipped with wireless direction finding and submarine signalling."
"In 1935 NDL sold ""Werra"", ""Coblenz"" and ""Saarbrücken"" to Flotte Riunite Cosulich-Lloyd-Sabaudo which renamed them ""Calabria"", ""Sicilia"" and ""Toscana"" and registered them in Genoa. In 1937 the three ships were sold to Lloyd Triestino, which registered ""Calabria"" in Trieste."
"On 10 June 1940 Italy declared war on France and the United Kingdom. At the time ""Calabria"" was in drydock in Calcutta in British India, so on 11 June the British authorities seized her. She was transferred to the MoWT, which appointed the British-India Steam Navigation Company to manage her. The MoWT planned to rename her ""Empire Inventor"", but this intention was overtaken by events."
"In December 1940 ""Calabria"" was ""en route"" to the UK with a cargo of 4,000 tons of iron, 3,050 tons of tea and 1,870 tons of oilcake. Her Master, David Lonie, commanded 128 officers and crew plus one DEMS gunner. She was also carrying 230 mostly Indian supernumaries who were travelling to crew other ships. Calabrias crew and supernumaries included also four Hong Kong Chinese crewmen and one Danish merchant officer."
"""Calabria"" left Freetown in Sierra Leone with convoy SLS-56 to the UK but fell behind. On the evening of Sunday 8 December German Type IX submarine , commanded by the U-boat ace Viktor Schütze, torpedoed her in the Western Approaches about west of Slyne Head in County Galway, Ireland. U-103 hit ""Calabria"" with one torpedo at 2058 hrs and a second at 2106 hrs. All 360 hands and passengers were lost: there were no survivors."
"""Calabria""s latitude was 52 degrees 26 minutes north, at that time of year the sun would have set just before 1600 hours local time, and the ship would have been blacked out under wartime regulations. However, the moon was waxing gibbous, had risen at 1315 hrs and did not set until 0218 hrs in the small hours of the next morning. If the sky was clear, Schütze would have been able to target ""Calabria"" by moonlight."
"The oldest man aboard was ""Calabria""s chief cook, Santan Martins, who was 79 years old. Martins may have been the oldest merchant seaman killed at sea in the Second World War."
"Those who died in ""Calabria""s sinking are commemorated in the Second World War section of the Merchant Navy War Memorial at Tower Hill in London. Her Indian seamen and supernumaries are commemorated in the Commonwealth War Graves Commission monuments at Chittagong and Mumbai."

"(c) continuous capacity building, imparting requisite skills and creating linkages with livelihoods opportunities for the poor, including those emerging in the organized sector."
(d) monitoring against targets of poverty outcomes.
"As NRLM follows a demand driven strategy, the States have the flexibility to develop their own livelihoods-based perspective plans and annual action plans for poverty reduction. The overall plans would be within the allocation for the state based on inter-se poverty ratios."

It has themes of rebellion, reflecting Higgins' general mood of failure after a business partnership fell through."
"Following the overwhelming success of Girls Aloud's debut single ""Sound of the Underground"", the group waited five months until May 2003 before releasing the follow-up. The song cemented their success when it peaked at number two in Ireland, Scotland and on the UK Singles Chart. ""No Good Advice"" performed moderately elsewhere, reaching the top forty in the Netherlands, the top fifty in Belgium and peaking at number 88 in Australia."
"The music video features Girls Aloud dressed in futuristic silver outfits and hologram effects. ""No Good Advice"" was promoted through various live performances and has since been performed on Girls Aloud's first three concert tours. Described as ""a disco track with guitar"", the song has heavy 1980s influences. The track was lauded by many contemporary music critics, who deemed it a worthy sequel to its predecessor and praised Higgins' production."
"Musically, the song was labelled ""a disco track with guitar - a cross between Blondie and The Bangles."" The song was written in the key of Bb minor. The song consists of a verse followed by a bridge and chorus. In place of a middle 8, there is a guitar solo instead. The song ends with a spoken outro."
"Originally written for Miranda Cooper under the pseudonym Moonbaby, ""No Good Advice"" seems to be about a rebellious girl who doesn't need ""no good advice"" and does things independently. However, according to an interview for ""The Guardian"" in July 2004, Brian Higgins said that the song reflected his general mood of failure after a special deal between Xenomania and London Records fell through in 2000, and about persisting in spite of what people told him to do or not to do. The song's chorus originally began with the phrase ""I don't like fried rice"". ""No Good Advice"" was sung over a rave backing track, until different Xenomania musicians were asked to contribute new backing tracks. Higgins was inspired by indie rock. He stated, ""pop music was on its backside and indie music was about to rise [...] The guitar riff on No Good Advice is very very similar to the riff on the track Michael by Franz Ferdinand."""
"Brian Higgins said that Girls Aloud initially didn't like the song - ""we played them some of it, and they said: 'That's not our sound.' I objected to the use of that phrase 'our sound'. I told them they had five minutes to talk about whether or not they wanted to continue with me. They went away and spoke about it and since then it's been fine. They come in expecting to work, and there's a trust there which, I think, dates back to that day."""

Later, he established his own principality of Chachabad and was killed in an ambush while fighting the Delhi Sultanate forces at the age of 73."
"While camping at village Chattriyan, near Sirsa, Rao Kandhal was ambushed by the forces of Bahlol Lodi. He called on his sons Rajsi and Sura for help, who were with him; however they fled leaving their father cornered. With only fifteen men around him, they gave fight with Rao Kandhal slaying nine men and drawing swords with Bahlol Lodi himself. The battle resulted in the death of the 73-year-old Rathore chief."
"Rao Bagha at the time was at Chachabad along with his son Rao Banir. Along with the forces of Rao Bika of Bikaner and Rao Jodha of Jodhpur, Rao Bagha led his forces against Bahlol Lodi and exacted revenge for his father's death. He was killed in this battle."
"After his death, instead of his grandson Rao Banir who was then a minor, the titles of Rao Kandhal went to Rao Rajsi (of Rajasar, later Rawatsar) owing to political intrigue. Rao Banir went to Sahawa, and later shifted his seat to Shivgarh Ghanghu where he finally settled.

and that the 3-sphere can be thought of as the boundary of the four-dimensional ball
"A knot formula_3 is slice if it bounds a nicely embedded 2-dimensional disk ""D"" in the 4-ball."
"What is meant by ""nicely embedded"" depends on the context, and there are different terms for different kinds of slice knots. If ""D"" is smoothly embedded in ""B"", then ""K"" is said to be smoothly slice. If ""D"" is only locally flat (which is weaker), then ""K"" is said to be topologically slice."
The following is a list of all slice knots with 10 or fewer crossings; it was compiled using the Knot Atlas:
"6, formula_4, formula_5, formula_6, formula_7, formula_8, formula_9, formula_10, formula_11, formula_12, formula_13, formula_14, formula_15, formula_16, formula_17, formula_18, formula_19, formula_20, formula_21, formula_22 and formula_23."

"On October 17, 2006, ""Broadcast to the World"" was made available for streaming via ""Alternative Press"". It was released in the U.S. on October 24 through Icon."
"Allmusic reviewer Rick Anderson called them a heavy rock band that are ""...owing far more to the old school than the new, but that adds the welcome element of solid melodic hooks to the mix."" He said that the music had elements of The Clash and Rancid. He also praised its range of songs to enable the band's audience to either sing/rap along, mosh along to or yell along to."

= = = Kong Jie = = =
Kong Jie (; born 25 November 1982) is a Chinese professional Go player.
"Kong Jie turned professional in 1994 at the age of 12. He was promoted to 7-dan after eight years in 2001. In 2004 he was sent into the Teda Cup as China's representative against Lee Chang-ho and Yoda Norimoto. Kong Jie is China's 29th professional 9-dan, doing so by being runner-up in the 13th Samsung Cup, and entering the finals of the Asian TV Cup for the first time. In 2009, Kong Jie achieved a major international breakthrough by winning the Asian TV Cup—defeating Korea's top three players of Lee Sedol, Lee Chang-ho and Kang Dongyun respectively. His win marked the end of several years of poor personal international results. Later in the year, Kong Jie followed up by reaching the semi-finals of the 14th Samsung Cup and won the title by defeating his two compatriots Gu Li and Qiu Jun."
"In 2010, Kong Jie passed the preliminary rounds of the 14th LG Cup to face former champion Lee Chang-ho in the finals. Kong won the match 2–0 and also the tournament. Later in the year, Kong Jie successfully defended his Asian TV Cup, defeating Korea's Lee Chang-ho and Japan's Yuki Satoshi. He followed that with another big win over a red hot Lee Sedol, to win the 23rd Fujitsu Cup. He arguably cemented his status as the 2010 world's strongest Go player. In 2011, Kong overcame compatriot Meng Tailing to again reach the LG Cup Final, but was unable to defend his title against another compatriot, Piao Wenyao, thus allowing the latter to win his first world title and be promoted to 9-dan professional on the merit of winning a world championship."
"This was the last international final Kong played in. Within the next few years, with the rise of new 1990s generation professionals and the increased competition at the international level, only Gu Li and Lee Sedol would continue to have high tournament placings in big international tournaments. During the 15th Samsung Cup, Kong defeated a soon to be wedded Lee Chang-Ho before succumbing to Kim Ji-Seok in the quarterfinals. The match, with Kong playing Black, turned out to be a crucial ""fight to the death"" of both sides' dragons, but Kong miscalculated a combination by Kim on move 150, and on move 202, resigned, thus failing to defend his crown."
Kong Jie is considered to be an expert at life and death problems. In China he is known as the King of Tsumego (King Kong).
"King's latest record is another solo effort, released independently, and features King on a broad range of instruments, including cello, drums, keyboard, bass, and guitar. In addition to playing all the instruments, King engineered and produced the record. His Myspace page announced the title of the new album as ""Humilitas Occidit Superbiam"", and it was subsequently released digitally in November 2009."
"Justin has admitted to have spent ""more than his means"" on his gear. The following list includes some of his acoustic guitars, as well as the electric guitars he has owned and performed with."
"Justin first approached Mike Doolin, an innovative luthier with an excellent reputation, to build a double-neck steel-string guitar. Justin wanted a guitar with two identical DADGAD-tuned necks to expand on his unique two-handed tapping style. The challenge was to design an instrument that could handle 340 pounds of string tension and yet still be acoustically responsive. The instrument features many of Doolin's innovations, including a pinless bridge, and adjustable neck angles. Doolin and King chose an instrument with a modified jumbo-style body, cocobolo (rosewood) back and sides, and a redwood top. The redwood is incredibly strong and stable, while at the same time being dynamic and possessing a rich acoustic tone. They also decided on using B-Band acoustic pickups, which are known for their excellent fidelity. The result is an unprecedented instrument, completely unique, with a wonderful tone. This can be seen on the song ""Knock on Wood"" and ""Crown"" (unofficial title)."

"Stempniak was traded for a third consecutive season at the trade deadline to the Boston Bruins in exchange for a second-round and fourth-round pick on February 29, 2016. Stempniak finished out the season scoring 10 points in 19 games."
"Unable to help the Bruins into the post-season, Stempniak familiarly approached the off-season as a free agent. Following a successful individual year, on July 1, 2016, Stempniak was promptly signed to a two-year contract to join his tenth NHL club, the Carolina Hurricanes."
"Stempniak joined the Boston Bruins during the start of training camp, signing a Professional Tryout (PTO) contract on September 10, 2018. Stempniak began the 2018–19 without a contract, however continued to train with the Bruins at times throughout the first months of the season.

"She was photographed in man's suit: to do this, she had asked permission from the police department."
"Bellanger was a favourite model of the sculptor Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse, who represented her as an allegory of spring in an elegant terracotta bust in which is today in the Musée Carnavalet in Paris."
"In a painting by Édouard Manet in 1863, Olympia, the artist endeavoured to evoke an odalisque, who receives a bouquet of flowers brought by her maid. According to Phyllis A. Floyd's study, ""The Puzzle of Olympia"", he gave the painting the features of Marguerite Bellanger."
"In June 1863, while on a carriage ride in Saint-Cloud Park, Emperor Napoleon III spotted Bellanger sheltering from the rain beneath a tree. Napoleon was bewitched by his new encounter."
"Marguerite Bellanger become the mistress of the Emperor. Soon, with the knowledge of all including the Empress Eugénie, she followed him on private and official trips."
"Amongst his numerous presents, the Emperor gave her two houses, one at 57 rue des Vignes, Passy, the other at Saint-Cloud, in the park of Montretout, which had a back door to the gardens of the castle."
"In February 1864, Marguerite Bellanger gave birth to a son; whom she named Charles Jules Auguste François Marie Leboeuf."
"After the birth, Bellanger retired for a while to rue de Launay in Villebernier and received a pension. In November 1864, the Emperor offered ""Margot"" the castle of Villeneuve-sous-Dammartin, near Meaux. The Emperor also gave the child a boarding house and the castle of Mouchy, in the Oise, which he had bought very discreetly some time before. Bellanger became usufructuary of the property."
"Always seductive, Bellanger still attracted men when she settled in Villeneuve-sous-Dammartin at the end of 1864. Among her lovers were General de Lignières and, according to some sources, Léon Gambetta."
"She was the subject of caricatures and gossip. Paul Hadol, in his series of caricatures on the ""Imperial Menagerie"", portrayed her as a cat."
"Her affair with the emperor continued during the Franco-Prussian War, and even during his captivity in Westphalia. In 1873, when the emperor died in exile in England, she travelled to England to mourn her 'dear lord'."
"At the fall of the Empire, she again traveled to England and married William Louis Kulbach, a British army officer. The presence of the couple William Kulbach and Marguerite Bellanger is recorded in Monchy-Saint-Éloi (Oise), France in the census of 1872. Bellanger gave her age as 30 years, whereas according to the data in her biography, she was 33 or 34."
"She lived the rest of her life as a member of the upper class, devoting herself to charity and good works."
"Marguerite Bellanger died at the age of 48 on 23 November 1886 after contracting a cold during a walk in the park of the castle at Villeneuve-sous-Dammartin.

"Her only son, Charles Leboeuf, made a career as an officer and died without issue on 11 December 1941. He was buried with his mother."
"Bellanger's character appears in Christian-Jaque's film Nana (1955), in which her character is performed by Nicole Riche."
"Marguerite Bellanger has been associated with a chocolate specialty: a praline was created to honour her. A chocolatier from Saumur designed, with the help of archivists of the city of Saumur, a specialty ""The Marguerite""."
"The coat of arms of Marguerite Bellanger is reproduced on the chocolates: a daisy with a heart of silver and gold petals. The praline ""with four spices"" (cloves, cinnamon, pepper and nutmeg) echos the qualities that the second Empire sought to give her: a varnish of heart, a spicy charm and an imperial dress."

"Norman Gunther Dyhrenfurth (Breslau, today Wroclaw, May 7, 1918 – Salzburg, September 24, 2017) was a German-Swiss-American mountaineer and filmmaker. He was the leader of the successful American Mount Everest Expedition of 1963, which placed six climbers on the summit."
"Norman Dyhrenfurth was born in Germany, the son of Himalayan explorers Günter Oskar Dyhrenfurth and Hettie Dyhrenfurth. His mother was of half Jewish ancestry. After the Nazis came to power, they emigrated, first to Austria in 1933, then two years later to Switzerland, where they became citizens. In 1936, Dyhrenfurth's parents were awarded a gold medal for alpinism at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. He emigrated to the United States in 1937. His service in the United States Army enabled him to gain joint U.S.-Swiss citizenship. He was the founder of the Motion Picture Division of the Department of Theater Arts at UCLA, but resigned that position in 1952. In 1954, he was a Fulbright scholar in Italy."
"Dyhrenfurth first came to the attention of the mountaineering community in the United States in 1939, when he completed some challenging climbs in the Grand Tetons. He was a participant in the 1952 Swiss Mount Everest Expedition. In 1960, he was cameraman for the Swiss expedition to Dhaulagiri, and after that climb, approached the government of Nepal about obtaining a permit for an American expedition to climb Mount Everest. He learned that a permit had already been granted to another American climber, William Hackett. Although Dyhrenfurth tried to combine his efforts with Hackett's, that expedition failed to gain funding and never took place. Another application resulted in India being selected for an attempt to climb Everest, but Dyhrenfurth persevered and tried again."
"Dyhrenfurth received a permit from the Nepalese authorities on May 10, 1961, for an American expedition to climb Mount Everest in the spring of 1963. He recruited a team of climbers that included Jake Breitenbach, Jim Whittaker, Willi Unsoeld, Lute Jerstad, Tom Hornbein, Dave Dingman and Barry Bishop. William Siri was the deputy team leader. Al Auten was the radio operator, and Gil Roberts was the team doctor. Sherpa Nawang Gombu was also part of the team."
"On March 23, 1963, Breitenbach was killed in the collapse of a serac in the Khumbu Icefall just above Everest Base Camp. The members of the expedition decided to proceed. Dyhrenfurth's style of leadership being democratic and team-oriented, he called a meeting, discussed the tragedy, let everyone speak, and when the decision was made to continue, the team remained intact. Dyhrenfurth's leadership style included a ""commitment to consensus"", and he was considered by those who have studied the expedition a ""huge asset to the team""."
"On May 1, Whittaker and Gombu reached the summit of Mount Everest by the South Col route used by the successful British expedition of 1953."
"On May 22, Unsoeld and Hornbein completed the first ascent of the West Ridge, descending by the South Col, thus completing the first traverse of Everest. That same day, Bishop and Jerstad reached the summit by the South Col route. The two pairs of climbers met up high on the mountain, and made their descent in the gathering darkness. From midnight until 4:00 am, they bivouacked high on the mountain, without sleeping bags, tents or bottled oxygen. All survived, though Unsoeld and Bishop suffered from frostbite, resulting in the amputation of toes."
"He played in 45 first-class matches between 1938–39 and 1963–64, and scored the first ever century in first-class cricket in Pakistan when, batting for Punjab against Sind in December 1947, he made 117. He also umpired 3 Tests in the 1970s."

He joined the service as an infantryman and spent 2003 - 2004 in Iraq, assigned to a Stryker Brigade Combat Team. In his book he expresses a great deal of enthusiasm about the benefits of wheels over traditional treaded armor in urban settings."
"It was in Iraq that Buzzell began publishing a blog under the title ""CBFTW"", ""Colby Buzzel Fuck The War"", as a replacement for his habitual journaling back in the States. The blog gained popularity quickly, because as an anonymous blogger, Buzzell was able to share more lucid experiences than an embedded journalist, and he was also able to share a bit more of the truth than the Army was able to."

"As he was taught that Islam and politics do not mix he says that """"one part of the book has stayed with me."""" This being the chapter ""Political System in Islam"". He says that Sarwar said that Politics within Islam is fundamental."
"Husain goes on to say that """"What I did not know at school was that Sarwar was a business management lecturer, not a scholar of religion. And he was an activist in the organisations that he mentioned Muslim Brotherhood and Jamat-e-Islami.

Ostensibly it all seemed harmless, but the personnel all belonged to Jamat-e-Islami front organisations in Britain.

"Norcot ward is the far eastern sector of the Reading borough portion of Tilehurst. As a commonly used suburban area, Norcot centres on Norcot Road and the upper Oxford Road on Norcot Hill. It is electorally partly in Norcot ward and partly in Kentwood to its west. All these areas form a mixture of suburban and urban parts of West Reading. The original hamlet was near the junction of Norcot Road and Romany Lane and was largely made up of Norcot Farm in the north-east of old Tilehurst parish. The name means 'North Cottage' and has a southern neighbour Southcote, below Tilehurst church and manor."
"The Norcot Water Tower, built at the end of the 19th century, is somewhat older than the more prominent Tilehurst Water Tower.

Collier's transported the clay via overhead cables to their main site in the Dee Road area of Tilehurst. St George's Church, Reading was built on the north-eastern edge of Norcot in 1886, largely to service the soldiers of the nearby Brock Barracks. Norcot Mission Church was started in 1929 to serve the new Norcot council estate. It started in a hut on land rented from the Pulsometer Engineering Works. The church moved to a permanent building in Brockley Close in 1972. The post office is on the Oxford Road."
"The ward of Norcot is west of the town centre and is bordered by Kentwood (the far western ward), Battle (the inner western ward), Southcote and Tilehurst wards."

Jurby () is one of the seventeen parishes of the Isle of Man.
"It is located in the north-west of the island (part of the traditional ""North Side"" division) in the sheading of Michael."
"For the purposes of local government, the whole of the historic parish forms a single parish district with Commissioners."
The Captain of the Parish (since 1999) is John James Quayle.
"Jurby parish is part of the Ayre & Michael constituency, which elects two Members to the House of Keys. Before 2016 it was in the Michael constituency."
"The Isle of Man census of 2016 returned a parish population of 776, a decrease of 2.7% from the figure of 797 in 2011."
"The parish of Jurby, which lies on the north-western coast of the island, borders those of Andreas to the east, Lezayre to the south-east, and Ballaugh to the south. It is low-lying overall: the highest elevations are some coastal dunes with a height of up to 39 metres."
"There is an industrial park on the old RAF Jurby Airfield, but otherwise the district is almost entirely agricultural. Apart from the Jurby airfield buildings, there are no significant settlements in the parish."
Jurby Airfield was originally used as a Royal Air Force training base in World War II. During the 1950s it was used as a training camp for Officer cadets on short term commissions in the RAF. The course lasted three months. Part of the airfield is now used as an industrial and retail estate. The old runways and taxiways now form the Jurby motorcycle race track.
"The grassland surrounding the airfield harbours many wildflowers, as the land has never been ploughed. Skylarks can be heard in summer when there are no races on. A large part of the airfield therefore has statutory protection under the Wildlife Act 1990 as an Area of Special Scientific Importance."
"A museum dedicated to transport in the island, the Jurby Transport Museum, is housed in an old aircraft hangar."
"Another museum nearby, the Isle of Man Motor Museum, was officially opened by the Lieutenant Governor on 22 May 2015."
"A tiny 8th century chapel dedicated to St Cecilia (the patron saint of music), was Jurby's first recorded church. St Cecilia's Day on 22 November was the parish festival day. There are several Viking carved crosses and gravestones within the church. Medieval objects have occasionally been excavated when new graves were prepared in the church grounds."
In medieval times the church was part of the Whithorn diocese in SW Scotland. This caused some political trouble when the English and Scots were at war; the Bishop invited the Scottish clergy of Jurby to visit him and was criticised by English authorities for fraternising with the enemy.
"The present St. Patrick's Church, Jurby was built during the war with help of RAF Jurby. There are a number of war graves, for British, Commonwealth and Polish servicemen. They died mostly from aircraft training accidents."
"The church is set on a slight headland on the coast and there are views south to Peel, north to Scotland, and inland across the rural north of the island, towards the hills."
The Isle of Man Prison operated by the Isle of Man Prison Service is located at Jurby.
Jurby was historically subdivided into five treens:

"David Gervan McMillan (26 February 1904 – 20 February 1951), known as Gervan McMillan, was a New Zealand politician of the Labour Party, and a medical practitioner."
"McMillan was born in 1904 in New Plymouth, the eldest child of Annie Gertrude Pearce and David McMillan, a dairy farmer near Stratford. He received his secondary education at Stratford Technical High School, where he was dux. With the help of the Taranaki Scholarship, he could afford to study medicine at the University of Otago, from where he graduated MB ChB in 1929. He was a medical practitioner, first practising in Kurow (1929–34) and then at 115 Highgate in Kaikorai, Dunedin (c.1935-36, after which the building was his electorate office to 1943, then again a medical practice after he had left parliament). The building was demolished after 1950 to make way for the Stuart Street extension."
"McMillan became involved with the Labour Party in 1923. In his view, good health extended beyond good medical support, but included educational, economic, and social factors."
"He represented the Dunedin West electorate from to 1943, when he retired. He was Minister of Marine (1940–1941) in the First Labour Government, and was responsible for much of the social security system introduced by Labour."
"In 1940 he ran for the position of Labour Party leader, being nominated by Arnold Nordmeyer, a friend from Kurow and a supporter of John A. Lee. Clyde Carr also ran, but the winner to replace Savage was his deputy, Peter Fraser."
"He was a Dunedin City Councillor for 1935–1938, 1938–1941, 1944–1947 and 1950–1951. He twice unsuccessfully stood for the Dunedin mayoralty; he was beaten by Andrew Henson Allen and Donald Charles Cameron in 1941 and 1944, respectively."

"Alexander Pushkin used his great-grandfather Abram Gannibal as the model for Ibrahim, the lead character in his unfinished novel ""The Moor of Peter the Great"". After leaving school in 1817, Pushkin met Abram's last surviving son, Peter. He met Peter again in 1825, after writing in his diary about wanting to ""get from him some memoirs about my great-grandfather."" He seemed to use his own experiences, along with Gannibal's to create the plot for ""The Moor of Peter the Great"". A stage version of the work was written by Carlyle Brown and premiered at the Alabama Shakespeare Festival's 13th Southern Writers' Project in March 2001."
"Abram Gannibal is a protagonist of the Soviet comedy movie ""How Czar Peter the Great Married Off His Moor"", although the film's plot has almost nothing to do with Gannibal's real biography. The film is partly based on Pushkin's ""Moor of Peter the Great""."
"There are several portraits thought to depict Gannibal, which include a painting of the Battle of Lesnaya by Pierre-Denis Martin the Younger. The young boy present in Martin’s painting is argued to be Gannibal, because of the young boy’s role as valet to Peter during military campaigns and Gannibal’s possible connection to the artist while in France. A portrait by Adriaan Schoonebeeck is also believed to portray Gannibal during his time with Peter the Great. In Schoonebeeck’s portrait of Peter the Great, the young servant boy directly behind Peter is thought to be Gannibal. Although there are a variety of portraits that claim to contain Gannibal, there is little evidence to suggest the claims are accurate."
"In the Lesnaya painting, the young boy is dressed in traditional slave attire, which Gannibal did not wear due to his status under Peter the Great."

"Au Wai Lun (, born 14 August 1971 in Hong Kong) is a retired Hong Kong professional football player. He announced his retirement after being unable to get a contract renewal with South China in Hong Kong First Division League after the 2006–07 season. He was considered to be one of the best strikers in Hong Kong."
"Au made his debut in Hong Kong First Division League for Tin Tin on 20 December 1988, against Happy Valley. He was 17 years old at the time and the final result of the match 0–2."
"Au was the leading goal scorer of the Hong Kong team, but retired from international football after an exhibition match with Manchester United on 23 July 2005."
"On the pitch, Au was recognised easily by his hairstyle – he sports peroxide-blond streaks in his locks. He wore the number 7 jersey for South China and was the captain of the team."
"He is also remembered by his famous ""cross passing during 1-on-1"" in the final of 2002 Carlsberg Cup against Honduras. In the match, he received a pass from his teammate, and got a goal opportunity. However, he passed the ball back and did not shoot. Further jokes on this were developed after this incident."
"Being a veteran striker, Au is valued for his international experience and his strong aerial ability. The 6' tall striker remains one of the best headers in the League."
"In the 2005–06 season, his good performance throughout the season could not prevent South China from finishing 7th in the league, with 2 points below the relegation line. He scored 8 league goals that season (4th among all players, 1st among Hong Kong players). Two years after retiring, he chose to return and play for Eastern, one of his former clubs."
"In the summer of 2007, after being offered a new contract with a salary cut by South China, he decided to retire. He claimed that the entire squad received new contracts with increments, but he was the only one with a salary cut. He thought the club was being unfair to him, who contributed for many years, even when the team performed so poor for several seasons."
"After his retirement announcement, he was approached by Star Publishing and with the help of a professional writer, published his biography titled, ""Lun . Football Biography"" (倫．球傳)."

It has been historically referred to as both Little Cacapehon and Little Capecaphon. The name is pronounced or ."
"The Little Cacapon is formed at the confluence of two small streams, the North Fork Little Cacapon and the South Fork Little Cacapon, shortly after they both pass north under the Northwestern Turnpike (U.S. Route 50) at Frenchburg. From Frenchburg, the Little Cacapon flows north between Town Hill, high, to its west and Little Cacapon Mountain, high, to its east. Flowing from a hollow in Town Hill, Shawan Run feeds into the Little Cacapon at Barnes Mill. Two miles (3 km) north, Three Churches Run also feeds into the river from Town Hill. At Higginsville on Slanesville Pike (County Route 3) near the old Vinita School, the river is fed by Crooked Run at Queens Ridge ( high). From Higginsville, the Little Cacapon continues northeast along Town Hill with Noland Ridge bounding it to the east. Also in the vicinity of Higginsville, Little Cacapon-Levels Road (County Route 3/3) intersects with Slanesville Pike, and as its name suggests, the road follows the Little Cacapon north until it diverges northwest to Levels via Hoffman Hollow. It is within this stretch of the stream that the Little Cacapon meanders by the community of Creekvale. At the entrance of Neals Run, the Little Cacapon is met to its east by Spring Gap Mountain and then flows beneath the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and empties into the Potomac River."
"The North Fork is a tributary of the Little Cacapon. The North Fork's source lies in a hollow between Piney Mountain and the southwestern end of Stony Mountain. From its source, the North Fork flows northeast along Grassy Lick Road (County Route 10). South Branch Mountain ( high) joins the North Fork to its west, and along with Stony Mountain to its east, the river diverges from Grassy Lick Road and continues its northeastern route to Shanks where it meets US Route 50. From Shanks, the North Fork merges with Camp Run and flows east under US Route 50 at Frenchburg, where it merges with the South Fork to create the Little Cacapon River."
"The South Fork is an tributary of the Little Cacapon. The South Fork is formed at its headwater in a hollow towards the southeastern end of Stony Mountain along South Fork of Little Cacapon Road (County Route 12) between the communities of Kirby and Ruckman. From its source, the South Fork flows northeast toward Bell Hollow, where it meets US Route 50 and turns north through Frye's Flat towards Frenchburg. The South Fork continues north under US Route 50, where it immediately joins with the North Fork to form the Little Cacapon River alongside Little Cacapon River Road (County Route 50/9)."

"The building was built on the site of the Central Recreation Ground, which had originally opened in 1864 and had since remained the main cricket venue in the town. This history is reflected by the statue in Queens Square of a batsman holding a pose having played a shot (""The Spirit of Cricket"" by Allan Sly). The observant shopper will be able to spot the ball that this batsman has hit (it can be seen in the wall above F. Hinds jewellers)."
"The land on which the shopping centre now stands had been underwater before the 13th century, and was the original harbour for Hastings. A series of severe storms, silting and sea erosion forced the town to move to where the current old town is. The Priory Valley eventually silted up completely and the area became known as Priory Meadow and turned into farmland in 1536."
"In 1864 the Priory Marshes were levelled and drained and opened as a Cricket Ground, by 1932 one corner of the ground was leased by the Maidstone and District bus company to use as a coach station, then in 1958 a row of shops was built on one side of the ground with seating above."
"In 1982 Hastings Council voted for a shopping centre to be built on the cricket ground and to move cricket to Summerfields, now Horntye Park. In 1987, planning permission for 420,000sq.ft of space for shops was granted. Due to the onset of recession, developer Speyhawk pulled out.

"The building of the estate was a joint project between the Greater London Council and Barnet Council. The plan was approved by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government in 1964, and the first family moved in on 23 October 1971. Sir Roger Walters was the Chief Architect and Gordon Wigglesworth was the Housing Architect."
"A typical characteristic of the estate was the plain, square, brick terraced houses and long winding low-rise flats, with flat roofs, also known as ""Brick Brutalist"" style. Most building names, walkways and roads on the estate have names linked to the aviation history of the site."
Not all of the old aerodrome was sold off for development; the Royal Air Force Museum is situated immediately to the south-east of the estate (with free entrance).
"A secondary road called Grahame Park Way, a typical 1970s-style collector road, runs along the eastern margin of the estate, parallelling the Midland Main Line (Thameslink) railway, and beyond that, the M1 Motorway."
The estate became the sole site of St. James Catholic High School in 1996.
"London Underground Colindale station, on the Northern line Edgware branch, is within comfortable walking distance of at least the south-east corner of the estate. The next tube station north, Burnt Oak is also accessible. Mill Hill Broadway Thameslink station lies to the north, a bus ride away. Several bus routes run into or near the estate."
"In the late 1980s, the estate went through its first regeneration process, which split the blocks of flats into smaller blocks, by removing connecting walkways, and added pitched roofs to many of the buildings."

= = = Angletarn Pikes = = =
Angletarn Pikes is a fell in the English Lake District near the village of Patterdale. Its most notable feature is the summit tarn from which it derives its name.
"Angletarn Pikes stands on the western arm of the long horseshoe ridge which surrounds the Martindale catchment, a system of valleys draining north into Ullswater. The adjacent fells on this ridge are Place Fell to the north and Brock Crags to the south. Beda Fell, a subsidiary ridge, also juts out into Martindale from Angletarn Pikes. This separates the heads of Boredale and Bannerdale."
"The western side above Goldrill Beck is steep and includes the faces of Dubhow and Fall Crags. The long eastern flank above Bannerdale is also pock-marked with crags, Heck Crag being the principal feature. The narrow north eastern slopes above Boredale, although steep, are less rocky and are cut by the upper ravine of Freeze Beck."
"North from the summit a long ridge drops over Stony Rigg (1,640 ft) to the walkers’ crossroads of Boredale Hause. From here paths run down to Hartsop, Patterdale and Boredale, while a further bridleway cuts across Beda Fell to Bannerdale. Boredale Hause carries the tiny ruin of a building named ‘Chapel in the Hause’ on OS maps. A mountain pass at 1,300 ft seems a curious place to construct a church. From the Hause a good path carries on northwards up Steel Edge to Place Fell."
"The north-east ridge to Beda Fell is also well defined, a fair path traversing a series of rocky knolls before the final rise to the summit, named Beda Head."
"Southward from Angletarn Pikes is Angle Tarn itself. This indented waterbody is about a quarter of a mile long with an island in the middle and forms a picturesque foreground for views of the Pikes. The tarn sits in a hollow on the centre of the ridge, issuing westwards through a break in the parapet via the ravine of Angletarn Beck. The ridge proper runs to the east of the tarn above the Bannerdale face, rising again to the unnamed 1,870 ft top above Satura Crag. This overtops the summit of Brock Crags, but was made subservient to it by Wainwright in his ""Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells""."
"Angletarn Pikes takes its plural from the two rocky towers at the summit, separated by perhaps 200 yards of peaty bog. The northern top is the true summit, the other being some six feet lower. The southern top is compensated by a clear view of Angle Tarn, described by Wainwright as ""among the best of Lakeland tarns"". The wider view stretches from the Helvellyn range to the spine of the Far Eastern Fells across Martindale."
"The fell can be climbed via Boredale Hause, making Patterdale, Bridgend, Hartsop and Boredale Head all possible starting points. An alternative is to climb from Martindale Old Church, ascending via the Beda Fell ridge or Angle Tarn. The route from Patterdale is often undertaken as the first section of the ascent of High Street."

= = = Emma Davies (actress) = = =
"Emma-Kate Davies, known as Emma Davies (born 7 March 1970), is an English actress. She is the daughter of actor Geoffrey Davies, of the television comedy series ""Doctor in the House"". She is notably recognised for her role of Anna De Souza in the ITV soap ""Emmerdale"" and for her portrayal of Diana Mitford-Guinness (later Lady Diana Mosley) in the Channel 4 mini series ""Mosley"". She currently resides in Barnes, South-West London with her husband Ross Allen, a garden designer and their daughter Camille."
"Davies' father, the stage and television actor Geoffrey Davies, influenced her choice of career immensely. He would often let her watch his stage performances from the wings as a child. She says that she ""watched his plays nearly every night"" and ""knew all the lines."""
"He also landed Emma her first television role at the age of 18 months on the 1970s sitcom, ""The Fenn Street Gang"". She says, ""I was in a pram and had to stuff an ice cream cone into someone's face!""."
She also appeared in a television advert for Colgate toothpaste when she was 14.
"She trained at the Corona Theatre School in London, and has been acting in small TV roles since the mid-1980s. In that time she has appeared in television series ""Heartbeat"", ""Doctors"" and Sky One's ""Dream Team""."
"Her first television role was as teenager Jo Daly in Central Television's Midlands based drama ""Boon"" between 1987 and 1989. She later played Juliette Bannerman in the ITV soap ""Families"" in 1993."
"In 1997, Emma portrayed the controversial historical figure Diana Mitford (later Diana Mitford-Guinness and Lady Diana Mosley) in the biographical Channel Four mini-series ""Mosley""."
"In 2001, she also had a small role in Michael Apted's popular film ""Enigma"". And in 2007 she was cast alongside David Morrissey, Lucy Cohu and Tristan Gemmill in the short-lived Channel Four drama ""Cape Wrath"", as regular character Abigail York."
"In June 2008 it was announced that she would join ""Emmerdale"" as Anna De Souza. She made her debut on the soap on 8 July. However, on 15 October 2008, it was announced that Emma would be leaving the show at the end of 2008. With the upcoming departures of her onscreen father Donald De Souza (Michael Jayston), and onscreen fiancé Matthew King (Matt Healy) and the axing of her onscreen brother, Miles De Souza, Anna would have been left as a singular character with no family, so it was decided that her contract would not be renewed."
"In an interview on ITV's chat show ""Loose Women"" on 12 December 2008, Emma announced that she would be starring alongside Laurence Fox, Matthew Macfadyen and Sally Hawkins in ITV's version of E. M. Forster's classic novel, ""A Passage To India"". However, less than a week later, ITV confirmed that the adaption had been axed before filming even began due to ""financial reasons""."
"Davies made her second appearance in the BBC drama ""Doctors"" starring alongside her father in an episode entitled ""Toys"" in which the pair played an estranged father and daughter."
"In 2010 she made an appearance in an episode of medical drama ""Holby City"" playing a distressed lawyer."
= = = Commodity value = = =
"In the field of economics, the commodity value of a good is its free market intrinsic value under optimal use conditions. In a free market, the commodity value of a good will be reflected by its price. For example, if an acre of land can yield a net of 100 dollars loss by lying fallow, 50 dollars gain by being planted with corn, and 100 dollars gain by being planted with wheat, then that acre's commodity value is 100 dollars; the farmer is assumed to put his land to best use. The price of a commodity fluctuates around its commodity value."
"A commodity value expressed as a price is determined by historical, social and cultural aspects of production and distribution. Karl Marx described price as the money-name for the labour realised in a commodity. A commodity value is dependent on its utility."
"Commodity value is of particular significance in the study of currency. For example, the commodity value of a coin is the value of the metal of which it is made. Gold and silver coins have a high commodity value, whereas fiat coins such as modern day quarters have a low commodity value. This is of particular historical relevance when analyzed in light of Gresham's Law."
"Because money becomes valuable not due to its substance, that is, its commodity value, but rather because of its performance, currencies tend to become token."
"Neapolitan Way (Foaled January 27, 1971) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse. A son of Barbizon and a grandson to Polynesian, he was out of a Bold Ruler mare named Bold Majesty. Neapolitan Way is best remembered for placing second in the second jewel of the American Triple Crown, the $250,000 grade 1 Preakness Stakes, to Little Current."
"Neapolitan Way's race history is very sketchy and vague, but he won 14 races during his career. It is also known that he placed in the top three finishers in 43% of his starts, a total of 36 out 84 in-the-money races. At age two, he finished third in the Miami Beach Handicap at Calder Race Course. At age three, he won the grade three Woodlawn Stakes (now renamed the James W. Murphy Stakes) at a mile on the turf at Pimlico Race Course and placed third in the Japan Racing Association Stakes at Laurel Park Racecourse. At age four, he placed third in the grade two Dixie Stakes at Pimlico."
"In mid May 1971, Neapolitan Way's trainer Lawrence W. Jennings decided to take a step up in class and run him in the second jewel of the Triple Crown. The Preakness Stakes is run at a mile and three sixteenths on dirt at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. Neapolitan Way was listed as one of the longest shots on the board at 24-1 on the morning line in a field of thirteen colts. The prohibitive favorite was the Kentucky Derby winner, Cannonade, at 2-1. Neapolitan Way broke slowly in tenth place out of thirteen and was outrun early under jockey Herb Hinojosa. Going into Pimlico's famous ""Clubhouse Turn,"" he fell further back into dead last. The fractions were moderate on the front end, with the first quarter in :231/5 and the half in :47 seconds. Going into the final turn, Neapolitan Way lugged in and collided with Hudson County, causing a severe cut high on his left rear leg. After the move inward, Hinojosa applied steady left handed whipping, straightening Neapolitan Way out at the top of the stretch. In the lane, he moved up quickly from 13th to 11th to 7th and then hit another gear. He started picking off horses, including Cannonade. In deep stretch, he moved into second place but was no threat to the winner, Little Current, who finished between seven and 21 lengths in front of the rest of the field. Cannonade finished one length behind Neapolitan Way in third with Jolly Johu three quarters of a length back in fourth. Neapolitan Way took home the 20% runner-up's share of the purse, equalling $30,000."

= = = Mount (heraldry) = = =
"In heraldry, a mount (also mountain, hill, hillock) is a representation of a hill or mountain as a curved terrace in base. When the mount is included in the lower part of the shield, it may be considered an ordinary rather than a charge."
"A trimount, also described as ""a mount mounted"", or ""shapournet shapourned"", is a representation of a mount with three tops. For mounts with more than three tops, the number of tops is blazoned as ""coupeaux"" (e.g. ""a mount with six coupeaux"")."
"The trimount (in German, ""Dreiberg"") can be found in all heraldic traditions (Gallo-British, German-Nordic and Latin), but it is especially common in Switzerland."
"A design of six hills (""Sechsberg"") can also be found in Swiss and Italian heraldry. In medieval German heraldry, mounts could have ten or more tops. Mounts with more than three tops are blazoned as a ""mount of N coupeaux"", e.g. German ""Sechsberg"" would be a ""mount of six coupeaux"", German ""Zehnberg"" as a ""mount of ten coupeaux"". A mount with more than six tops can also be blazoned as ""Schroffen"" in German heraldry."
"A ""terrace in base curved"" is blazoned ""mount"", ""hill"" or ""hillock"" when represented in vert; sometimes as ""a mount vert"" for clarity. Sometines, a ""terrace in base curved"" may be blazoned as ""mount"" even when not tinctured vert. This is mostly found in cases where the base represents a hill for one or several of the charges in the coat of arms. Classification either as an ordinary or, in many cases, as a charge, is a matter of interpretation."
"The coats of arms of Hungary and Slovakia depict a trimount, first used in the seal of Stephen V of Hungary (r. 1270–1272)."

= = = Liberator (video game) = = =
"Liberator is an arcade game released by Atari, Inc. in 1982. It is based on the ""Atari Force"" comic book series published by DC Comics from 1982 to 1986. ""Liberator"" has been described as the opposite of ""Missile Command"", in that the player destroys cities from space instead of defending them from the ground. Only 762 arcade machines were ever made."
"The story ""Code Name: Liberator"" describes the premise of the arcade game in detail and was included as a special insert in two comic books cover dated January 1983. Characters and concepts from the comic exist throughout the game. In the opening screen of the arcade game, Commander Champion of the ""Atari Force"" asks the player to help free the galaxy from the evil Malaglon Army."
"The ""Liberator"" controls consist of a trackball, fire button, and shield button. The player controls a coordinated attack from four star ships at the corners of the screen. The primary target of the attack are enemy bases on a rotating planet in the center of the screen. The trackball is used to move a cross-shaped cursor. The fire button fires a missile at the cursor's location from the closest ship. The shield button is used to activate force fields around the ships. The shield can only take four hits each round, and the count is shared between all ships."
"At the beginning of each level, the player is flying through outer space and spaceships fly on screen from the left and right and leave in an arc. They try to ram into the player's ships. Shields do not work during this stage."
"After this stage, the player is taken to a view of a rotating planet. The most prominent enemies are red flashing missile bases. They shoot missiles, fireballs, and star balls at the player's ships. The enemy bases can also detach from the planet, turn into satellites, and orbit the planet while shooting missiles. Once all missile bases are destroyed, the player moves on to the next level. At higher levels, there is the white master base. It is very intelligent, and it can change the direction or speed of the planet rotation to avoid getting hit. At the end of each stage, the player is awarded a bonus ship for every 20,000 points."
"Missiles can be destroyed, although some split into four smaller particles when destroyed. Fireballs take four hits to destroy, but they slow down on each hit. Star balls also take four hits to destroy, but return to normal speed soon after being hit."
"Flying saucers sometimes appear from the planet. Flying saucers shoot a large, deadly laser which cannot be stopped."
"A level select menu allows the player to start at any third level (1, 4, 7... up to 22)."
"""Liberator"" was released for Microsoft Windows, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 in 2003 as part of ""Atari Anthology"", a collection of Atari arcade and 2600 games."
"1990 also saw the first international tournament—""RugbyFest"" held in Christchurch, New Zealand. As well as a variety of club sides, including teams from Japan (but not the Japanese national team), were four ""national"" teams—USA, New Zealand, USSR, and the Netherlands—who played a round-robin tournament. The winner was New Zealand, who then played—and beat—a combined ""World XV""."
"""Rugbyfest 1990"" pointed the way to the next big leap forward—the first women's rugby world cup, which took place in Wales the following year. Timed to coincide with the second men's world cup being held in England it did not meet with official approval from World Rugby (then known as the International Rugby Football Board), a decision which threatened the competition and was a factor in the New Zealand RFU not supporting their entry. However, this did not stop the New Zealanders from taking part—nor Wales, the United States, England, France, Canada, Sweden, USSR, Japan, Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands."
"The competition was run on a shoestring. Russian players sold souvenirs before and during matches to raise funds to cover their expenses, while four England administrators re-mortgaged their houses to cover the expenses of attending the competition. But after fifteen matches the first world champions were crowned—the United States, who beat England in the final. Despite the lack of support from the men's game, and very little media coverage, the competition had been a success, and the women's game continued to grow."
"In 1994 a second world cup was awarded to the Netherlands, but constant prevarication by the IRFB about whether they would (or would not) give the tournament official status caused huge problems for the hosts. Without IRFB support there was a fear that many unions would not send teams which would threaten the tournament (and even the Dutch union's) viability. In fact the IRFB went so far as to threaten sanctions against any unions did take part—thus ensuring that New Zealand, Sweden and Germany withdrew. Faced with this the risk of major losses was as too great and the Dutch withdrew both as hosts and participants with barely weeks to go."
"It was Scotland who stepped in to save the event with only 90 days to organise it. The second world cup was in the end a purely northern hemisphere affair with 11 remaining teams (consisting of the four home nations, France, the United States, Japan, Sweden, Russia, Canada and Kazakhstan) joined by a Scottish Students XV. The final was a repeat of 1991, but with this time England overcoming the United States 38–23, the final being played at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh. Despite everything, the tournament had been a success, and the game continued to grow."
In 1996 the IRFB established a Women's Advisory Committee which produced a five-year development plan for the game. One of its main targets was a 100% increase in player numbers by 2001. Elsewhere in the world...
"Widespread acceptance of the game led to women's versions of other major rugby union tournaments (the women's Five Nations begins in 1999), and growing numbers of headlines. In 2000 the Irish WRFU affiliated fully with the IRFU—but there were still set-backs. In 2002 the Australian RFU dropped support for the women's team's entry to the World Cup. The decision was seen as a factor in IOC rejection of rugby as an Olympic sport, and was reversed two years later."
But this was unusual. Women's teams were now being accepted on the main stage. In 2002 Scotland played their first women's match at Murrayfield and in 2003 England staged the first women's international at Twickenham.
"In 2006 the RFU devoted the rugby museum's main annual exhibition to the history of women's rugby—""Women's Rugby—A Work in Progress"", and the same year saw the Women's Rugby World Cup broadcast live on the internet."
"The growth in popularity among women attracted women in both developed and emerging nations, being the fastest growing sport in the world. The participation rates in both rugby sevens and rugby unions (with 15 players) has close to 500,000 new players joining every year globally. According to World Rugby, women's rugby is growing faster (if not as fast) as men's rugby and it is estimated that by 2026 40% of the total number of rugby players will be female. The game remains an amateur, minority sport—but a fast-growing one played in over 80 countries worldwide. Cost and player numbers mean that, in many of these nations, sevens tends to dominate, but 15-a-side championships have now been established in all regions."
"The highest profile women's rugby tournament is the Rugby World Cup, historically known as the Women's Rugby World Cup. The women's World Cup began in 1991, and has generally been played every four years. The most recent World Cup was held in Ireland in 2017, where New Zealand were the winners. In 2019, World Rugby announced that sex/gender designations would officially be removed from the title of the World Cup; the first tournament affected by this policy will be the next women's World Cup in 2021, to be hosted by New Zealand."
"The most successful nations in the World Cup have been New Zealand, which has won it five times, and England, which has reached the final seven times."
The primary annual global competition for women's rugby sevens is the World Rugby Women's World Series. The Women's Series was launched in the 2012-13 season. It features 4-6 tournaments each year.
"Women's rugby sevens at the Hong Kong Sevens has been dominated by New Zealand, with either the New Zealand team (1999–2001) or the Aotearoa Maori team (playing as New Zealand) winning the annual tournament from 1997 until 2007. The United States won the Hong Kong Sevens in 2008 by defeating Canada in the final (New Zealand failed to send a team)."
The inaugural Women's Rugby World Cup Sevens tournament took place in Dubai together with the men's tournament in 2009. Australia defeated New Zealand 15–10 in extra-time to become the first to win the Women's Rugby World Cup.
"Women's rugby sevens was included in World Rugby's successful bid to reintroduce rugby to the Olympics in 2016. At the 2016 Olympics, Australia defeated New Zealand in the final to win the gold medal."
"Women's rugby sevens has also been added to several regional multi-sport tournaments, including the Pan American Games in 2015 and the Commonwealth Games in 2018."

"Sesame Street is a nationally syndicated comic strip inspired by ""Sesame Street"". Written and drawn by veteran Sesame animator Cliff Roberts, the earliest concept art was created in 1970, and by 1971, a promotional booklet was created as the comic entered the market, courtesy of King Features. The strip debuted on November 15, 1971, in more than 175 newspapers, and ran until 1975. The strip, which ran both daily and on Sundays, was conceptually similar to the series in its pedagogical goals, but, in the first year of the strip, conspicuous by the absence of the Muppets."
"Instead, the strip featured several new characters created by Roberts, such as Jasper and Julius, Christopher Clumsy, and Miss Fortune; in 1972, all of these characters appeared in animated inserts on ""Sesame Street"" itself. Also regularly seen was Professor Drummond Bugle, a lecturer, similar to more generic characters used in Roberts' animated segments. Roberts fleshed out the strip's cast with a vast menagerie of newly minted animal characters. Amongst them were Lotta Elephant, Richard Bird, Hedda the frog, Balderdash the mouse, Titus the snake, Thomas Turtle, Crawley the worm, and an errant spider. A pair of nameless, Muppet-esque monsters also skulked through on occasion."
"Though the earlier version of the strip avoided the Muppets, Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch and Cookie Monster joined the cast in December 1972, and appeared through the end of the strip's run in 1975."
"Like ""Sesame Street"", the comic strip was largely educational, using broad humor to relate learning concepts. The most frequent topics were parts of the body, shapes, and identification of objects. Other subjects included opposites or pairings (up and down, here and there, etc.) and emotions. Letters and numbers surfaced rarely, presumably because the strip's target audience was different from the largely pre-literate television audience. However, many strips were pure comedy, revolving around the characters' eccentricities and foibles."

"Marguerite Bellanger (10 June 1838 - 23 November 1886) was a French stage actress and courtesan. She was a celebrity of Second Empire France and known for her relationship with Napoleon III of France. She was often caricatured in contemporary press and is considered to be the model for Émile Zola's ""Nana"". A candy is also named after her. She was reputedly the most universally loathed of Napoleon III's mistresses, though perhaps his favorite. She outlived Napoleon's deposal in 1870 and died in 1886 aged 48."
"Marguerite Bellanger was born Julie Justine Marine Lebœuf on 10 June 1838 in Saint-Lambert-des-Levées, Maine-et-Loire to François Lebœuf and Julie Hanot. Born into poverty, she began working as a laundress in Saumur at the age of 15."
"After an affair with a lieutenant opened her eyes to the wider world, she became an acrobat and trick rider in a provincial circus, she travelled to Paris where she made her debut as an actress at the theater ""La Tour d'Auvergne"", under the name of Marguerite Bellanger (the surname of an uncle)."
"Although her acting talent was limited, she was cunning. She became one of the most sought-after cocottes of all Paris. She led a princely lifestyle, and the climax of her gallant life took place in the years 1862-1866. She is reported to have said: ""It is very nice Paris, but it is only habitable in the beautiful districts ... In the others, there are too many poor!"" according to ""Le Rappel"" of 16 April 1871. Author and playwright, Ludovic Halévy, is reputed to have said that Bellanger had the ""daintiest feet in Paris""."
Her celebrity status was such that she became a figure in the literary and artistic world. Zola quoted her as a friend of Nana.
"In 1947, he returned to Italy and a year later published his memoirs as ""Due dittatori di fronte"" (""[Two] Dictators Face to Face"" – i.e.: Mussolini and Hitler). Much details about the hierarchy and events of the war, not well known, are in the book."

"The first element is ""Gausta"", the name of the whole mountain, the last element is the finite form of ""topp"" m 'top, summit'. The name ""Gausta"" is probably a shortened form for ""*Gaustafjell"" (Gausta mountain), because Gausta originally was the name of a farm beneath the mountain. (For the same development see Dovre.) The Old Norse form of the name was maybe ""*Gautstǫð"", the name is then a compound of ""gaut"" f 'flooded place', and ""stǫð"" f 'stead, landing place for boat'. (The farm lies at Rjukan river.)"
"There is a funicular railway inside the mountain, built for military purposes. This ascends from the base of the mountain almost to the summit. A short railway takes the passengers from the mountain base horizontally to the lower station deep inside the mountain. It was built to access the military radio relay station built at and inside the mountain top. The installation is now a tourist attraction. It was financed mainly by American military grants, and cost one million US dollars to build from 1954 to 1959."
"Gausta skicenter is a merge of two small alpine ski areas (Gaustatoppen Skisenter and Gaustablikk Skisenter) with furter expansion of slopes. As of 2019 it has 45 km of slopes and 550 metres height difference. Located 180 by road from Oslo, it aims to be one of the major ski areas of Norway."

"Portloe is a small village in Cornwall, England, UK, situated on the Roseland Peninsula, within the civil parish of Veryan, east of the village of the same name. Portloe harbours two full-time working fishing vessels, the ""Jasmine"" and ""Katy Lil"", which fish for crab and lobster in Veryan and Gerrans Bay, and a fleet of smaller leisure boats in summer. The harbour is run by a committee, the chair of which is Charles Williams. Visitors are attracted to Portloe by its fishing, scenery, and walks."
"Portloe lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Almost a third of Cornwall has AONB designation, with the same status and protection as a National Park. The South West Coast Path passes through the village."
The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) stationed a lifeboat at Portloe in 1870 but it was withdrawn in 1887 without ever having performed a rescue. It was kept at first in a boat house built at the end of the road above the beach. It proved difficult to move the boat across the beach so a new house was built in 1877 nearer the water. The first house was converted into a church; the second was a school for a while but has since become a private dwelling house.

= = = Forget The Rules = = =
"Forget the Rules was an Australian short form episodic comedy-drama, which ran for two seasons from 2005 to 2007. It was the first scripted drama in the world to simultaneously broadcast over broadband, mobile phones and television. It employed the push model of crossmedia, and was one of the more successful models of an often failed interactive format that included audience input into the script and submitting visual elements as part of a tight weekly production cycle. It was conceived and piloted in Australia during 2004. In Canada, Season 1 has been broadcast on Movieola."
"Season 1 of Forget the Rules ran on Channel V (Foxtel), Hutchison 3G mobile phones and on the web, and consisted of nine minutes of drama produced every week featuring audience-driven story directions. Three-minute episodes were broadcast on Monday, Tuesday & Wednesday, starting October 10, 2005. Audiences voted on a choice of three possible story directions following the Wednesday episode. The 117 minutes of production (39 x 3min episodes) represents the equivalent of 5 x 30min episodes on free-to-air TV."
"Season 2 ran weekdays from November 12, 2007 to December 21, 2007. The series was distributed across Optus Television (Ovation Channel weekdays, The Music Factory weeknights) and Optus Zoo (mobile), as well as online through the show's website, YouTube, Facebook, and MySpace."
"The Season 1 scripts were written on Thursday based on the most popular audience vote. Pre-production and rehearsal on Friday. All nine minutes of the show was shot on Saturday and was broadcast each Monday-Wednesday throughout the 13-week season. Because of the requirement for rapid turnaround, stories were designed to be topical and responsive to genuine audience input, and was limited to an M rating. ""Forget the Rules"" was designed to appeal to story literate young audiences through interactivity. Jim Shomos, the creator and executive producer, was cited as saying young audiences need “more story per minute” and emphasised the importance of fast-paced stories with rapid developments, particularly for short form content:"

"Müngsten Bridge is the highest railway bridge in Germany. The bridge is high and spans the valley of the river Wupper, connecting the cities of Remscheid and Solingen. This stretch is part of the Wuppertal-Oberbarmen–Solingen railway. It is used exclusively by the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn line S 7. On 1 April 2013, the Müngsten Bridge was closed for extensive renovation work: it reopened on 27 July 2015, but a further lengthy closure for a comprehensive corrosion treatment is planned for 2018. During the works, the train from Solingen Hbf to Remscheid Hbf terminated at Solingen Mitte and a bus continued to Remscheid."
"Originally the bridge was named ""Kaiser-Wilhelm-Brücke"" (Emperor Wilhelm Bridge) to honour Emperor Wilhelm I. After the end of the monarchy the bridge was renamed after the nearby settlement of Müngsten, which is close to the city limits of Solingen, Remscheid and Wuppertal. Today, the settlement no longer exists, so Müngsten is simply a landmark."
"First drafts for a bridge connecting the two cities of Remscheid and Solingen go back as far as 1889. Preparatory work began in 1893, the bridge was finished in 1897."
"The six support columns have a maximum height of 69 meters (230 ft). In the middle of the structure, the main arc has a span of 170 meters (560 ft). The overall length of the structure is 465 meters (1,530 ft)."
"A total of 5,000 tons (4,900 LT; 5,500 ST) of steel were used in its construction. 950,000 rivets hold the structure together. During construction, a number of advanced building techniques were used."
"Anton von Rieppel (1852 – 31 January 1926), an architect and engineer, was in charge of the project. A memorial plaque at the foot of the bridge reminds one of his efforts."
"Originally, the bridge was planned to be single-track. However, high future traffic growth projections led to the redesign as a dual-track bridge. Before its opening, the rail distance between the cities of Remscheid and Solingen was . With a direct connection via the bridge, this distance shrank to ."
The Prussian Parliament approved the 5 million Marks required to build the bridge in 1890.
"The first breaking of the earth was on 26 February 1894. A total of 1,400 kilograms (3,100 lb) of dynamite and 1,600 kilograms (3,500 lb) of black powder were needed during construction."
"The bridge's official inauguration celebration took place on 15 July 1897. Emperor Wilhelm II did not attend the ceremony in person. Prince Friedrich Leopold of Prussia attended the festivities instead. Emperor Wilhelm II visited the bridge two years later, on 12 August 1899."

"Paradise Valley High School (PVHS) was the first of five high schools built in the Paradise Valley Unified School District, located in Phoenix, Arizona. Paradise Valley High School opened in 1957. The school's athletic teams are referred to as the Trojans. Featuring a Block Schedule, Paradise Valley teaches a wide selection of courses in not only core academics but also technology and the arts. The football program installed one of the first artificial turfs in the state, the only Sprinturf installation in Arizona, as its main football, soccer, and track field at a cost of $1 million."
"Paradise Valley opened in 1957 at Bell Road and 40th street which at the time was on the outskirts of Phoenix. The original campus consisted of an administration building, several small classroom buildings and a small gymnasium and athletic fields located to the north of the classroom buildings. In the 1960s a library, cafeteria, shop building and three larger classroom buildings were added to the campus. The gymnasium was also expanded in the 1960s. In the early 1970s a new building called the 700 building was constructed. Between 1976 and 1979 several new buildings designed by the Tempe architecture office of Michael & Kemper Goodwin Ltd. The plan included a new vocational education building and an additional physical education building. In 1982 the remaining 1957 classroom buildings were demolished to make way for a larger classroom building. The new building was nearly complete when the 1983-1984 school year began. At that time the 1960s buildings were updated. In 1983 the 700 building was demolished to make way for a new 1,200 seat auditorium and associated fine arts building. The auditorium and fine arts building were completed in 1984. In 1990 it was decided that Paradise Valley would close its original campus and move to a new campus being constructed at Union Hills Drive and 16th Street. The new campus opened for the 1991-1992 school year. It was then decided that the original campus would be renovated and reopened. The original gymnasium as well as the administration building were demolished and rebuilt and the campus was thoroughly spruced up. The updated school reopened for the 1993-1994 school year. The new campus on Union Hills was then renamed North Canyon High School. The CREST STEM program was established in 2010 offering students classes in Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics. In 2013 the three 1960s classroom buildings were demolished to make way for two new twin story buildings housing the science department and CTE classes. In 2013 the auditorium was also completely renovated. The 2013 projects were completed by McCarthy Construction."
When the school was established the Paradise Valley High School District was also created. In July 1976 the high school district unified with the elementary district to form the Paradise Valley Unified School District.

I-35-L in Round Rock in Williamson County. The road has major intersections with I-35, US 183, and SH 45."
"The road opened in 1945 as a Farm to Market Road. The road is now officially designated by TxDOT as Urban Road 620, but all Urban Roads in Texas retain their former Farm or Ranch to Market highway signs."
"RM 620 was originally designated on July 9, 1945 as Farm to Market Road 620 from Round Rock to SH 29, the former designation of US 183 south of Liberty Hill until May 23, 1951. On May 13, 1946, the road was extended to the Travis County line. On August 26, 1948, the road was extended to the former community of Hickmuntown, also called Four Points, at the location of the current intersection with RM 2222. The road was completed on December 17, 1952 when it was extended to SH 71, known locally before August 31, 1965 as RM 93 (but was signed as SH 71 since October 31, 1955).

"James Ronald McDaniels (April 2, 1948 – September 6, 2017) was an American professional basketball player. McDaniels played collegiately for Western Kentucky University and was the No. one overall pick in the 1971 American Basketball Association Draft. McDaniels was an NBA All-Star."
"A 6'11"" power forward/center, McDaniels averaged nearly 40 points per game as a senior at Allen County High School in Scottsville, Kentucky. From 1967 to 1971, he played at Western Kentucky University, leading his team to a third-place finish in the 1971 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. (The NCAA later voided Western Kentucky's participation in the tournament, accusing McDaniels of signing with an agent while still in college.) He also set WKU school records with 2,238 career points (now tied with Courtney Lee) and 1,118 career rebounds."
"McDaniels was drafted by the Seattle SuperSonics in the second round of the 1971 NBA draft and No. one overall by the Dallas Chaparrals in the 1971 American Basketball Association Draft, but he began his professional career with the Carolina Cougars of the American Basketball Association, who offered him a $1.35 million contract to be paid over twenty-five years. Reportedly, the Cougars first approached McDaniels during November 1970, while he was still playing for Western Kentucky. McDaniels averaged 26.8 points and 14 rebounds in 58 games with the Cougars during the 1971–72 season and scored 24 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in the 1972 ABA All-Star Game. However, he feuded with the Cougars while trying to renegotiate his contract – he wanted his salary to be spread over fifteen years, rather than twenty-five – and near the end of his rookie season he decided to leave the Cougars for the SuperSonics."
"McDaniels remained with Seattle for the next two full seasons. However, he struggled to maintain the same level of production he had achieved in the ABA, and by the 1973–74 NBA season, McDaniels was averaging just 5.5 points per game. During that time, McDaniels was dogged by off-court troubles as the Cougars questioned the legality of his jump to the NBA. He later admitted in an interview, ""I should have stayed in the ABA for a couple of years. I was just young and things started going bad for me there and I didn't know how to handle them."" SuperSonics coach and general manager Bill Russell ultimately released McDaniels in fall 1974."
"In 1948, platforms on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line from 103rd Street to 238th Street were lengthened to 514 feet to allow full ten-car express trains to platform. Previously the stations could only platform six car local trains. The platform extensions were opened in stages. On April 6, 1948, the platform extension opened for stations from 103rd Street to Dyckman Street, with the exception of 125th Street."
"This station, located atop an embankment, has two side platforms, two tracks and maintains a level grade. It lies at the northern portal of the Washington Heights Mine Tunnel, which takes the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line through the bedrock of Manhattan. North of the station, the terrain of Upper Manhattan drops abruptly and the line becomes elevated to Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street."
"Both platforms have beige windscreens and red canopies with green frames at the center. A waist-level black fence runs along either side. The platforms are offset as the South Ferry-bound one inclines more to the north than the 242nd Street-bound one. Each platform has two ""DYCKMAN ST"" mosaics."
"This is one of only two aboveground Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line stations with two tracks (the other being 242nd Street). A center express track, which is currently unused in revenue service, forms just north of this station and runs nonstop to just south of 242nd Street. A spur track used to be located to the south of the station, but was removed when the platforms were extended."
"The station is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as is the nearby Substation 17."
"A 1991 artwork in the waiting area is called ""Flight"" by Wopo Holup. It features ceramic relief tiles depicting birds in flight."
"The station's only entrance is a station house slightly above ground level at the southern corner of Nagle Avenue, Dyckman Street, and Hillside Avenue. There is a ramp and stairs from street level to the station house. It has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two staircases to each platform, with an elevator to the southbound platform."
"In February 2014, as part of an ongoing rehabilitation, the MTA built a ramp from street level to the mezzanine and opened an elevator to connect the southbound platform to the mezzanine. The elevator, which was not originally planned in the station renovation, was built due to a lawsuit by the United Spinal Association. The elevator is of a ""machine room-less"" design and is the first of its type to be installed in the New York City Subway system. The renovations also included rehabilitation of the tunnel portal, realignment and rehabilitation of the platforms and installation of new cast iron lighting fixtures."
"The southbound elevator is located at the southwest corner of Hillside Avenue, St. Nicholas Avenue, and Fort George Hill, and is accessible by a ramp to the station house."
"This station is not accessible to the disabled on the northbound side because the suit was settled only after the northbound side was already renovated, and in any case, the area's geography made it prohibitively expensive to add an elevator to the northbound platform. Northbound accessibility was proposed in February 2019 as part of the MTA's ""Fast Forward"" program."

"Itbāy () or ʿAtbāy is a region of southeastern Egypt and northeastern Sudan. It is characterised by a chain of mountains, the Red Sea Hills, running north–south and parallel with the Red Sea. The hills separate the narrow coastal plain from the Eastern Desert."
"The Red Sea Hills are composed of the exposed Neoproterozoic volcano-sedimentary rock of the Arabian-Nubian Shield. Although the rock itself is 550–900 million years old, the mountains were created by uplift when the Red Sea itself was formed in the Oligocene, only some 23–34 million years ago. The Red Sea Hills are thus part of the same formation as the Sarawat Mountains of Saudi Arabia and the mountains of the Sinai Peninsula. The Red Sea Hills rise almost to today, but in the past were much higher. The Oligocene uplift caused the rejuvenation of their streams and the increased erosion removed most of the limestone and sandstone to expose the basement layer."
"The Itbāy is arid, receiving less than of rainfall each year with high variability. The Barka River, the most significant of the few seasonal streams that flow into the Red Sea, rises in the Red Sea Hills of Sudan and empties into the sea at the Tokar Delta. In prehistorica times it was probably a permanent river."
"The Red Sea Hills are a source of porphyry, which was being mined as early as the fourth millennium BC."
"The Red Sea Hills are inhabited by the Beja people, who practice pastoralism and live mainly near the dry riverbeds, ""wādī""s, that flow seasonally into the sea and the Nile, where there is limited vegetation. In antiquity, the Beja were known as the Blemmyes and their presence in the hills is detected archaeologically by the presence of Eastern Desert Ware from the fourth century AD. The material culture of the hills places it firmly within ancient Egypt's sphere of influence. Extensive mining settlements have been found in the Wadi Allaqi and the Wadi Gabgaba. The early Blemmyes built platform tumuli (flat-topped burial mounds), and the appearance of cairns to mark burials in the late Middle Ages may be linked to Islamization."

= = = Itinerarium = = =
"An itinerarium (plural: itineraria) was an Ancient Roman road map in the form of a listing of cities, villages (""vici"") and other stops, with the intervening distances. One surviving example is the Peutinger Table (""Tabula Peutingeriana""); another is the Antonine Itinerary."
"The Romans and ancient travelers in general did not use maps. They may have existed as specialty items in some of the libraries, but they were hard to copy and were not in general use. On the Roman road system, however, the traveller needed some idea of where he or she was going, how to get there, and how long it would take. The ""itinerarium"" filled this need. In origin it was simply a list of cities along a road: ""at their most basic, ""itineraria"" involve the transposition of information given on milestones, which were an integral feature of the major Roman roads, to a written script."" It was only a short step from lists to a master list. To sort out the lists, the Romans drew diagrams of parallel lines showing the branches of the roads. Parts of these were copied and sold on the streets. The very best featured symbols for cities, way stations, water courses, and so on. The maps did not represent landforms but they served the purpose of a simple schematic diagram for the user."
"The Roman government from time to time undertook to produce a master itinerary of all Roman roads. Julius Caesar and Mark Antony commissioned the first known such effort in 44 BC. Zenodoxus, Theodotus, and Polyclitus, three Greek geographers, were hired to survey the system and compile a master itinerary. This task required over 25 years. The result was a stone engraved master ""itinerarium"" set up near the Pantheon, from which travelers and itinerary sellers could make copies."
"Archaeology has turned up some itinerary material in unexpected places. The Cups of Cadiz, four silver cups found by workmen excavating a foundation at Bracciano in 1852, are engraved with the names and distances of stations between Cadiz and Rome. The term itinerary changed meaning over the centuries. In the ""Itinerarium Burdigalense"" (Bordeaux Pilgrim, 333 AD), the itinerary is a description of what route to take to the Holy Land. The ""Itinerarium Alexandri"" is a list of the conquests of Alexander the Great. Today it means either a travel journal or a list of recommended stops."
"Tracey Lee Wickham (born 24 November 1962 in Rosebud, Victoria) is an Australian former middle distance swimmer. Wickham was the World Champion for the 400 m and 800 m freestyle in 1978, and won gold in both events at the 1978 and 1982 Commonwealth Games. She is a former world record holder for the 400 m, 800 m and 1500 m freestyle. Despite her success in the pool, Wickham has battled hardship and personal tragedy throughout her life."
"Wickham began swimming at the age of eight at John Rigby’s pool in Brisbane and mastered her technique under the guidance of Peter Diamond. At the age of thirteen, she was selected to be on the Australian team for the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games but failed to reach the finals at that meet."
"In 1977, Wickham’s family moved to California, where she trained for six months with coaching legend Mark Schubert. She returned to Brisbane at the end of 1977 and she came under the guidance of coach Bill Sweetenham at the Commercial Swimming Club. On 8 February 1978, Wickham broke her first world record, the 1500 m freestyle, in a solo swim at the Fortitude Valley Pool in Brisbane, clocking 16:14.93."
"At the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, Wickham won both the 400 m and 800 m freestyle. That same year, she set world records in both events, and won both the 400 m and 800 m freestyle at the 1978 Berlin World Championships, setting a world 400 m record of 4.06.28, which stood as the Championship record until 2007. Both world records stood until 1987, long after her retirement."
"In 1980, Australia decided against an official boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics. A number of Australian athletes elected to boycott the Games personally. Wickham maintains that she withdrew from the team because of illness, as she was suffering glandular fever at the time, not because of the boycott. The 800 m freestyle was won by fellow Australian Michelle Ford at that meet."
"Wickham retired at the end of 1979 due to financial problems. The policy of amateurism was upheld by the Amateur Swimming Union of Australia during this period, meaning Wickham could neither earn money from the sport nor receive any prizes."
"Wickham returned to swimming in the early 1980s under coach Laurie Lawrence. She won gold in the 400 m and 800 m freestyle at the 1982 Commonwealth Games, where she took the Athletes Oath at the Opening Ceremony. Her gold medal for the 400 m was presented to her by Queen Elizabeth II and Wickham retired from swimming immediately afterwards."
"Following the birth of her daughter, Wickham dived back into the water in May 1990, again with Lawrence as her coach. She competed in the 7.6 km open water race from Magnetic Island to Townsville, placing first in the female division. She also won the female division of the Lake Trasimeno 20 km marathon race. She retired for good following the birth of her son in January 1992."
"She was educated at the All Hallows' School, in Brisbane along with her sisters Julie and Kelly. Wickham married in 1986 and had two children, Daniel and Hannah. She divorced her husband in the mid-1990s."
"Her daughter, Hannah, died at the age of nineteen from synovial sarcoma on 2 October 2007. Wickham is an ambassador for Hannah’s Chance Foundation, which supports teenage cancer victims."
"On 30 December 1978, Wickham was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire."
"On 10 December 1985, she was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame, and was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame at Fort Lauderdale in 1992."
"On 25 October 2000, she was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for outstanding contribution as a competitor in swimming."
"On 13 June 2005, she was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for service to Australian swimming and to the development of young swimmers through teaching and coaching roles."

= = = Tarr = = =
"Tarr is a modernist novel by Wyndham Lewis, written in 1909–11, revised and expanded in 1914–15 and first serialized in the magazine ""The Egoist"" from April 1916 until November 1917. The American version was published in 1918, with an English edition published by the Egoist Press appearing shortly afterwards; Lewis later created a revised and final version published by Chatto and Windus in 1928. Set in the bohemian milieu of pre-war Paris, it presents two artists, the Englishman Tarr and the German Kreisler, and their struggles with money, women and social situations. The novel abounds in somewhat Nietzschean themes. Tarr, generally thought to be modelled on Lewis himself, displays disdain for the 'bourgeois-bohemians' around him, and vows to 'throw off humour' which he regards—especially in its English form—as a 'means of evading reality' unsuited to ambition and the modern world. This self-conscious attitude and the situations that it brings about are a major source of the novel's pervasive dark humour. Lewis will later clarify that there ""is laughter and laughter. That of true satire is as it were tragic laughter"". Kreisler, a violent German Romantic of protean energy and a failure as an artist, is in many ways the focus of the novel. An indication of the extremity of his vivid portrait is Lewis' own wondering several years later if he had, in Kreisler, anticipated the personality of Hitler."
"The American first edition used a punctuation mark (resembling an equals sign: '=') between sentences (after full stops, exclamation marks or question marks; in the earlier ""Egoist"" version it had been an m-dash). It has been claimed that these were an attempt by Lewis, an artist, to introduce 'painterly strokes' into literature. This has, however, been disputed by Dr. John Constable, who believes that they are nothing more than a German punctuation mark briefly adopted by Lewis. Lewis himself wrote to Ezra Pound about this when reconstructing missing parts of the manuscript for the U.S. edition: ""Were those parallel lines = Quinn mentions kept going by the Egoist, or not? Could not they be disinterred, & used by Knopf?"" (Lewis to Pound, October 1917). Evidently not all were disinterred, as large stretches of the book as published are without them."
"Both the 1918 and 1928 versions of the novel have been in and out of print since its original publication. Oxford University Press has reissued the 1928 text, edited and with notes by Scott W. Klein of Wake Forest University, as part of its Oxford World Classics paperback series in 2010."

"The Giver is a 2014 American social science fiction dystopian film directed by Phillip Noyce and starring Jeff Bridges, Brenton Thwaites, Odeya Rush, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsgård, Katie Holmes, Cameron Monaghan, Taylor Swift, and Emma Tremblay. The film is based on the 1993 young adult novel of the same name by Lois Lowry."
"""The Giver"" premiered on August 11, 2014, and was released theatrically in the United States on August 15, 2014, grossing $67 million on a $25 million budget. It received a People's Choice Award nomination for ""Favorite Dramatic Movie"". However, it received generally mixed reviews from critics."
"Following a calamity referred to as The Ruin, society has been reorganized. Conflict, pain, and suffering have been mostly removed from human experience, but emotion, love, freedom, individuality, and joy have also been removed. Babies are brought into being through genetic engineering, and sexual desire is chemically suppressed. All memories of the past are held by one person, the Receiver of Memory, for the purpose of shielding the rest of the community from pain. The Receiver of Memory and his/her protégé are the only persons able to see in color, an ability otherwise eliminated from the community to prevent envy. The community is ruled by elders, including a Chief Elder."
"Jonas is a 16-year-old boy whose best friends are Asher and Fiona. On graduation day, Jonas is told that he will become the next Receiver of Memory and will progressively receive memories from his predecessor, the Giver. During his training with the Giver, Jonas gradually learns about the past and about joy, pain, death, and love. Jonas stops taking his daily injections and begins to experience emotion. Those who leave the community are said to have been ""released to Elsewhere"", but Jonas learns that this is really a euphemism for death by lethal injection. Jonas also learns that the Giver's daughter, Rosemary, had preceded Jonas as Receiver of Memory. When she began her training, however, Rosemary became so distraught from the memories she received that she asked to be euthanized."
"Jonas begins to teach his findings to Fiona and shares the concept of emotion with her. Jonas then tells her to stop taking her daily injection. The next day, he kisses her; kissing is an antiquated action that is unknown to the community and which Jonas learned about through memories received from the Giver, and touching a non-family member is against the rules. Jonas also shares his memories with a baby, Gabriel, who was brought home by his father. He develops a close relationship with Gabriel after discovering that he shared the birthmark Jonas has—the mark of a potential Receiver of Memory."
"Appalled by the deception of his community and by the Elders' disregard for human life, Jonas comes to believe that everyone should have memories of the past. Eventually, the Giver and Jonas decide that the only way to help the community is for Jonas to travel past the border of their land into the area called ""Elsewhere"". Doing this would release memories and color back into the community. When Jonas tries to leave his neighborhood, he encounters Asher. Asher tries to stop Jonas, but Jonas punches him. Jonas retrieves Gabriel—who is to be ""released"" for having failed to meet developmental markers—at the Nurturing Center; Fiona kisses Jonas and helps him escape with Gabriel."
"Meanwhile, Jonas' mother and Asher go to the Chief Elder to tell them Jonas is missing. Jonas steals a motorcycle and drives away with Gabriel. Asher is assigned by the Chief Elder to use a drone to find Jonas and ""lose"" him. When Asher finds Jonas and Gabriel in the desert, Jonas implores Asher to trust him and let them go. Instead, Asher captures them with the drone, but then sets them free by dropping them into a river; when questioned by the Chief Elder, Asher lies and says that he has followed her orders."
"Fiona is condemned to be ""released"" for helping Jonas. Just as she is about to be ""released"" by Jonas's father, the Giver tries to persuade the Chief Elder that the Elders should free the community. Unmoved by the Giver's arguments, the Chief Elder asserts that freedom is a bad idea because left to their own devices, people make bad choices."
"Jonas and Gabriel enter a snowy area. Jonas falls to the ground, overcome by the cold weather. However, he sees a sled like the one that he rode in a memory he received from the Giver. Jonas and Gabriel ride the sled downhill and cross the border into Elsewhere, freeing their community. This action saves Fiona's life, as Jonas's father realizes what he is doing and stops short of ""releasing"" her. Jonas realizes that he has succeeded in his quest."
"Jeff Bridges initially wanted to film the movie in the mid-1990s, and a script was written by 1998. Various barriers marred the production of the film, including when Warner Bros. bought the rights in 2007. The rights then ended up at The Weinstein Company and Walden Media."
"Bridges originally intended that his own father, Lloyd Bridges, would play the title character, The Giver, but he died in 1998."

His most recent position was as the defensive line coach for the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Western Illinois University, a small college football program, but received attention for his aggressive style of play. Although Cox was a relatively late fifth-round pick by the Miami Dolphins in the 1991 NFL Draft, he rose to prominence as a standout linebacker during his twelve NFL seasons from 1991 through 2002. He was a three-time pro bowler with the Miami Dolphins, and was also a member of the New England Patriots club that won Super Bowl XXXVI."
"Cox was a member of the East St. Louis High School Flyers high school football team, where he was coached by Bob Shannon."
"Cox attended Western Illinois University and was a mass communications major and a letterman in football. In football, he was a four-year letterman and a two-year starter. As a senior, he was named as a first-team All-America selection by the ""Football Gazette"" and was a first-team all-conference selection. As a junior, he was named the Western Illinois Most Valuable Player. As a sophomore, Cox played in every game, and finished his sophomore season with 54 tackles, four forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries, two interceptions and three blocked kicks. As a freshman, Cox was a reserve nickel-back and finished the season with 30 tackles."
"Cox was drafted by the Dolphins in the fifth round of the 1991 NFL Draft, chosen 113th overall. As a rookie, Cox started 13 games as the Dolphins right outside linebacker, racking up a total of 61 tackles along with two sacks. Miami finished out the season 8-8. In his sophomore campaign, Cox blossomed and helped lead the Dolphins to an 11-5 record and the AFC Championship Game. He made his first Pro Bowl and was named to the All Pro team after recording 127 tackles, 14 sacks and five forced fumbles. Miami switched to a 4-3 defense in 1993 and Cox was moved to right linebacker. The team started out 9-2, but lost their last five to miss the playoffs. Cox again led the team with 122 tackles, four forced fumbles and four fumble recoveries. He also collected five sacks and an interception."
"Cox earned his second Pro Bowl selection in 1994, starting 16 games at middle linebacker, leading the team with 100 tackles. Miami finished the season 10-6, winning the Wild Card Game against the Kansas City Chiefs, 27-17 before losing the Divisional Playoff to the San Diego Chargers, 22-21. In 1995, Cox was selected to his second consecutive Pro Bowl, and third overall. He again started every game at middle linebacker, finishing the year with a team high 119 tackles, 7.5 sacks and three forced fumbles. The Dolphins went 9-7 before bowing out in the Wild Card Game to the Buffalo Bills, 37-22. The defense tied for the AFC lead by allowing only seven rushing touchdowns. Overall, Cox spent five years with the Dolphins playing both outside and middle linebacker, starting 75 out of a possible 78 games."
"Cox would go on to play seven more seasons in the NFL for the Chicago Bears, New York Jets, New England Patriots, and New Orleans Saints. In a career encompassing 165 games, Cox recorded 764 tackles, tallied 51.5 quarterback sacks, caught four interceptions and forced 22 fumbles. Among his most famous plays was a 27-yard interception-return touchdown against the Patriots in September 1999 while playing with the Jets; another famous play came with the Patriots in September 2001 in a game against the Indianapolis Colts; Cox hit receiver Jerome Pathon in the first quarter, a hit that briefly knocked Pathon out."
"Throughout his NFL career, Cox was easily recognizable on the field due to the unusual headrest- or ""surfboard""-style neck roll he wore and colored to match his uniform jersey."
From 2004-2005 he worked as an analyst for TVG Network. Cox also co-hosted an afternoon drive radio program for Fox Sports Radio in 2006 alongside Chris Myers.
"He was an assistant defensive line coach for the New York Jets for three seasons (2006–08) under Eric Mangini. After Mangini was fired and became the coach of the Cleveland Browns in January 2009, he brought Cox with him, where Cox was the defensive line coach."

Although the phrase originated earlier, it was popularised in Gilbert and Sullivan's 1885 comic opera ""The Mikado"", where it appears in the song near the end of Act I, ""I Am So Proud"". It has since been used in popular songs, song titles, literature, as well as in general speech."
"John Conington's 1870 translation of the ""First Satire of Horace"" includes the following lines:"
"In Act I of the 1885 Gilbert and Sullivan opera ""The Mikado"", the Emperor of Japan, having learned that the town of Titipu is behind on its quota of executions, has decreed that at least one beheading must occur immediately. In the dialogue preceding the song, three government officials, Pooh-Bah, Ko-Ko and Pish-Tush, discuss which of them should be beheaded in order to save the town from ""irretrievable ruin"". Pooh-Bah says that although his enormous ""family pride"" would normally prompt him to volunteer for such an important civic duty, he has decided to ""mortify"" his pride, and so he declines this heroic undertaking. He points out that since Ko-Ko is already under sentence of death for the capital crime of flirting, Ko-Ko is the obvious choice to be beheaded."
"The three characters then sing the song ""I Am So Proud"". In the last lines of the song, Pooh-Bah, Ko-Ko and Pish-Tush contemplate ""the sensation"" of the ""short, sharp shock"" caused by being beheaded:"
"The phrase is particularly popular in music. For example, the phrase is used in the song ""Us and Them"" (from Pink Floyd's 1973 album, ""The Dark Side of the Moon"")."
"""Short Sharp Shock"" is also the name of a 1984 album by Chaos UK. It also appears in the title of an album, ""Short Sharp Shocked"", by Michelle Shocked and the EP ""Shortsharpshock"" by Therapy?. Short Sharp Shock is the name of a crossover thrash band from Liverpool, England. The phrase is used in the song ""East Side Beat"" by The Toasters, and in the 1980 song ""Stand Down Margaret"" by The Beat. It can also be found in the lyrics of a Billy Bragg song entitled ""It Says Here"" found on his 1984 album ""Brewing Up with Billy Bragg"" and of a They Might Be Giants song entitled ""Circular Karate Chop"" on their 2013 album ""Nanobots""."
"In literature, the phrase is used in the title of a 1990 fantasy novel, ""A Short, Sharp Shock"" by Kim Stanley Robinson. In the 1996 fantasy novel by Terry Pratchett, ""Feet of Clay"", police commander Sam Vimes is ""all for giving criminals a short, sharp shock"", meaning electrocution."

Donahue was born in Springfield, Ohio. He batted and threw left-handed."
"Donahue had his greatest success from 1904 to 1908, after switching to first base for the Chicago White Sox. Donahue's defensive skills were a key to the White Sox' 1906 World Series championship team, and he led American League first basemen in fielding percentage, assists, and putouts for 3 consecutive seasons, from 1905 to 1907. In 1907, Donahue had 1,846 putouts, which is still the major league record for putouts by a first baseman. He also holds the major league single season record for most chances accepted per game with 12.65 in 1907."
"Though known mostly for his fielding, Donahue was also a decent hitter from 1905 to 1907. In 1905, he was among the American League leaders in batting average (.287), on-base percentage (.346), RBIs (76), and stolen bases (32). In 1906, Donahue was among the league leaders in stolen bases (36) and sacrifice hits (36) and was one of only three White Sox starters to bat over .250 for the 1906 World Champion ""Hitless Wonders."" Donahue hit for a .278 average (5-for-18) with 2 doubles, 1 triple and 4 RBI."
"On October 10, 1906, Donahue broke up a World Series no-hit bid by Cubs' pitcher Ed Reulbach with a single in the 7th inning."
"In 1907, Donahue led the league in games played (157) and at bats (609) and was among the leaders in hits (158) and RBIs (68)."

"The two women lived the rest of their lives at Hanstead. The new main house became the home of the daughter, while her mother lived in the guest house (see dower house). They were world travellers who reportedly shared an interest in big game hunting and a love of animals. Hanstead House was said to have been adorned by a large stuffed bear which they had killed in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. On the grounds they kept a seal, penguins, and wallabies."
"In 1925 they expanded their interests to the breeding of Arabian horses. The two women used their considerable fortune to build stables, purchase breeding stock, and establish a stud. Despite its relatively late start, Hanstead was soon considered ""second only in importance to"" Crabbet Arabian Stud, whose founders, husband and wife team Wilfrid Scawen Blunt and Lady Anne Blunt, had introduced the breed to England in 1878, and from whom the Yules bought and leased horses. A third stud, Courthouse, was also held up to be of the same level, and the three competed against each other at the annual show at the Roehampton Club"
"Gladys Yule died within a year of Judith Blunt-Lytton (Lady Wentworth), who had inherited Crabbet from her parents and run it for 40 years. The deaths of these two only children, at a time of high inheritance tax, meant that in 1957 a substantial number of British-bred Arabian horses left the country, improving the breed's bloodlines elsewhere. The Hanstead horses were appreciated in the United States and in South Africa."
"Following the death of Gladys Yule in 1957, Hanstead Park was put on the market, where it remained uncared for over a considerable period of time. Many country houses were being demolished at this time."
"In 1959 it was brought to the attention of the American evangelist Herbert W. Armstrong, who had arrived in England looking for a larger office for the British branch of his Radio Church of God. He bought the house and land as the site for his second Ambassador College campus. By the time of the purchase the guest house had already been sold separately to another buyer, who used the property as a private home like an island within the campus. Armstrong wrote in Chapter 72 of his autobiography that Trans World Airlines (TWA) had been considering Hanstead House as a school for stewardesses. ""Yet this mansion, with these outstanding gardens, the aviary, greenhouses, cedars of Lebanon, all finally came to us for £8,000 ($22,800) - the not uncommon price of a five- or six-room cottage on a forty- or fifty-foot lot in America, - and that on terms that gave us several years to pay."""
"In 1959 Hanstead House was renamed Memorial Hall in memory of Richard David Armstrong, Herbert's deceased son. The college at Bricket Wood began its first freshman year in 1960. (The first Ambassador College opened in 1947 at Pasadena, California; in 1964 a third college opened in Big Sandy, Texas which for a brief time became Ambassador University. All three colleges have since closed down.) From the radio studio of Ambassador College, daily broadcasts of ""The World Tomorrow"" were heard around the world on hundreds of stations. There was also a sizeable printing establishment on the site. Improvements were made to the grounds: tennis courts, track, gymnasium, and an Olympic standard (imperial measurements) indoor swimming pool."
"When Ambassador College closed its doors in 1974, the sports facilities were sold separately from the main buildings and eventually became part of a sports centre. The pool, one of the most modern in the area, became home to Verulam amateur swimming club in 1979."
"The college became a corporate training centre, first for the Central Electricity Generating Board and then, from 1993, to the banking group HSBC. In 2004 a volunteer-led community woodland was established on land given by the bank; Hanstead Wood has won a Green Flag Award."
"The album produced three number 1 singles on the Hot Country Songs chart with ""Days Go By"", ""Making Memories of Us"" and ""Better Life"", as well as the number 2 hits ""You're My Better Half"" and ""Tonight I Wanna Cry"". The song ""Live to Love Another Day"" also peaked at number 48 on the country charts, even though it was not released as a single. The album also includes a cover of Elton John's ""Country Comfort"", which appeared on his 1970 album ""Tumbleweed Connection""."
"""Making Memories of Us"", written by Rodney Crowell, was originally recorded by Tracy Byrd on his 2003 album ""The Truth About Men"". It was also recorded by Crowell himself, along with his backing band The Notorious Cherry Bombs, on their 2004 self-titled album. Nine of the album's songs were written by Urban. Urban produced the tracks ""God's Been Good to Me"" and ""Live to Love Another Day"" himself, and then he co-produced the rest of the tracks with Dann Huff."
"""Country Comfort"" is a cover of a track from Elton John's ""Tumbleweed Connection""."
"The album has received positive reviews from Allmusic, BBC, ""Entertainment Weekly"", and ""Rolling Stone"". Three tracks from the album, ""Days Go By"", ""Making Memories of Us"", and ""Tonight I Want to Cry"" were included in an About.com ranking of Urban's top ten songs."
"""Be Here"" received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Country Album."
"The album was certified 4× Platinum by Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and remains as Urban's best-selling album to date, with sales of 3,639,000 copies in the United States, as of July 2009; it also reached number 8 on the Canadian album chart, number 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Albums chart and number 3 on the Billboard 200."
"Two covers exist on this album. The first cover shipped with a color photograph of Urban sitting at a table at a coffee shop. This image is also featured on Urban's 2005 compilation album, ""Days Go By"". The second cover shipped with a monochrome photograph of Urban driving a car."

"Air Baron is an economic strategy game published by Avalon Hill in 1996. Despite its family-oriented marketing, ""Air Baron"" plays far more like a wargame than a typical family money-driven game like ""Monopoly"". ""Air Baron"" is for two to six players, adjusting the playable area and victory conditions accordingly."
"""Air Baron"" challenges players to build an airline empire in the United States by amassing a plurality of market share and liquid assets."
"Players seek to gain ""dominance"" or ""control"" of hubs in order to amass market share. Dominance of a hub is gained by controlling the majority of associated domestic spokes; it carries a moderate income potential and market share gain. Control of a hub is gained by controlling ""all"" of the associated domestic spokes; it doubles the income potential and market share gain of dominance."
Any uncontrolled domestic spoke may be purchased at face value. Takeovers of controlled spokes require a higher fee and an opposed dice roll versus the controlling player. Several factors contribute both positively and negatively to each player's dice total.
"If, at the end of his turn, a player has a combined total of market share and cash equal to or greater than the victory margin, he wins."
"At the start of each round, one color-coded chit per player is placed in a cup. The chits are drawn sequentially to determine the current order of play. While the order of play in an individual round is generally unimportant, the interval between turns for a single player is a significant consideration."
"Starting cash is determined by die roll. To offset the advantage of first play, each player receives cumulatively more money during the initial turn."
"Every purchased spoke, plus all hubs, have a unique chit placed in a cup. At the start of every turn, the player randomly draws two chits, paying the owner appropriately. Chits are replaced at the end of each round."
"Beyond the primary domestic spokes, players can also purchase foreign spokes and jumbo jets. Foreign spokes benefit opposed takeovers at the associated hubs. Jumbo jets provide similar bonuses on the domestic spoke where deployed, or they can be held in reserve for later use in an opposed takeover. Additionally, spokes with jumbos pay double the usual rate."
"Normally players are limited to one purchase or takeover attempt per turn. However, players can declare a state of ""Fare Wars"" that allow an indefinite number of domestic takeover attempts provided:"
"While in Fare Wars, players receive an additional takeover dice roll bonus. Profits, however, are not earned while in Fare Wars. Since the state can only be entered or exited at the beginning of a player's turn, the randomized play order has a major impact on the potential for income loss."
"Several optional rules, including strikes, crashes, government loans, and bidding, are provided as part of an ""advanced version"". These rules may be added to the basic game collectively or individually as desired."

"In Hungarian mythology, Csaba, the mythical son of Attila the Hun and ancestor of the Hungarians, is supposed to ride down the Milky Way when the Székelys (ethnic Hungarians living in Transylvania) are threatened. Thus the Milky Way is called ""The Road of the Warriors"" (lit. ""Road of Armies"") . The stars are sparks from their horseshoes."
"To the Māori the Milky Way is the waka (canoe) of Tama-rereti. The front and back of the canoe are Orion and Scorpius, while the Southern Cross and the Pointers are the anchor and rope. According to legend, when Tama-rereti took his canoe out onto a lake, he found himself far from home as night was falling. There were no stars at this time and in the darkness the Taniwha would attack and eat people. So Tama-rereti sailed his canoe along the river that emptied into the heavens (to cause rain) and scattered shiny pebbles from the lakeshore into the sky. The sky god, Ranginui, was pleased by this action and placed the canoe into the sky as well as a reminder of how the stars were made."
"The Kaurna Aboriginal people of the Adelaide Plains in South Australia see the band of the Milky Way as a river in the sky world. They called it Wodliparri (wodli = hut, house, parri = river) and believe that positioned along the river are a number of dwellings. In addition, the dark patches mark the dwelling place of a dangerous creature known as a ""yura""; the Kaurna call these patches Yurakauwe, which literally means ""monster water""."
Aboriginal groups from the Cape York region of Queensland see the band of light as termites that had been blown into the sky by the ancestral hero Burbuk Boon.
"Further south, the band of stars that comprise the Milky Way are seen as thousands of flying foxes carrying away a dancer known as Purupriggie."
The Aranda who come from central Australia see the band of the Milky Way as a river or creek in the sky world. This stellar river separates the two great camps of the Aranda and Luritja People. The stars to the east of this river represent the camps of the Aranda and the stars to the west represent Luritja encampments and some stars closer to the band represent a mixture of both.

= = = Dynkin system = = =
"A Dynkin system, named after Eugene Dynkin, is a collection of subsets of another universal set formula_1 satisfying a set of axioms weaker than those of σ-algebra. Dynkin systems are sometimes referred to as λ-systems (Dynkin himself used this term) or d-system. These set families have applications in measure theory and probability."
"A major application of λ-systems is the π-λ theorem, see below."
"Let Ω be a nonempty set, and let formula_2 be a collection of subsets of Ω (i.e., formula_2 is a subset of the power set of Ω). Then formula_2 is a Dynkin system if"
"Equivalently, formula_2 is a Dynkin system if"
The second definition is generally preferred as it usually is easier to check.
"An important fact is that a Dynkin system which is also a π-system (i.e., closed under finite intersections) is a σ-algebra. This can be verified by noting that conditions 2 and 3 together with closure under finite intersections imply closure under countable unions."
"Given any collection formula_16 of subsets of formula_1, there exists a unique Dynkin system denoted formula_18 which is minimal with respect to containing formula_19. That is, if formula_20 is any Dynkin system containing formula_19, then formula_22. formula_18 is called the Dynkin system generated by formula_16. Note formula_25. For another example, let formula_26 and formula_27; then formula_28."
"If formula_29 is a π-system and formula_2 is a Dynkin system with formula_31, then formula_32. In other words, the σ-algebra generated by formula_29 is contained in formula_2."
One application of Dynkin's π-λ theorem is the uniqueness of a measure that evaluates the length of an interval (known as the Lebesgue measure):
"Let (Ω, ""B"", ""λ"") be the unit interval [0,1] with the Lebesgue measure on Borel sets. Let μ be another measure on Ω satisfying μ[(""a"",""b"")] = ""b"" − ""a"", and let ""D"" be the family of sets ""S"" such that μ[S] = λ[S]. Let ""I"" = { (""a"",""b""),[""a"",""b""),(""a"",""b""],[""a"",""b""] : 0 < ""a"" ≤ ""b"" < 1 }, and observe that ""I"" is closed under finite intersections, that ""I"" ⊂ ""D"", and that ""B"" is the σ-algebra generated by ""I"". It may be shown that ""D"" satisfies the above conditions for a Dynkin-system. From Dynkin's π-λ Theorem it follows that ""D"" in fact includes all of ""B"", which is equivalent to showing that the Lebesgue measure is unique on ""B""."

Anita Carol Hill (born 1951) is a LGBT American minister in the Lutheran Church. She is one of the first ordained lesbian women in the church and became a pastor before the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) changed its policy on LGBT ministers.
"Hill was born in 1951 and was raised in the Roman Catholic faith in Shreveport, Louisiana. As a young adult, she lived in Crystal Springs, Mississippi, and became involved in the United Methodist Church. Hill attended Mississippi State University where she earned a bachelor's degree in science. Hill went on to gain a master's degree in religious studies and a master of divinity degree from United Theological Seminary of the Twin Cities and studied at Luther Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota."
"In the 1980s, Hill started out as a lay minister in the Saint Paul-Reformation Lutheran Church. By the 1990s, her congregation wanted her to be ordained despite rules against lesbian pastors in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) at the time. The church's head pastor, Paul Tidemann, created the goal for his church that it would have a non-celibate, openly gay minister by 1993. Hill was an open lesbian in a committed relationship. She was ordained on April 28, 2001, within the Extraordinary Lutheran Ministries but was later censured for her ordainment as an LGBT person. On September 18, 2010, she was formally inducted into the ELCA Clergy Roster. She left working at the church in 2012 and went on to fight a state constitutional amendment in her state which banned gay marriage."
In 2012 Hill joined ReconcilingWorks as regional director for the St. Paul area and later became its deputy director.

"Gilbert Jesse Brown (born February 22, 1971) is a former American football player. A nose tackle who played for the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (1993–99, 2001–03), Brown played 125 Packers games (103 starts) recording 292 tackles (186 solo) and seven sacks. Nicknamed ""The Gravedigger,"" in honor of his celebratory dance following a thunderous tackle, Brown played in 15 Packers playoff games. He was a major contributor on strong defenses during the mid-1990s. His best season was 1996, when Green Bay won Super Bowl XXXI. He was also part of the Kansas team that won the 1992 Aloha Bowl, and was selected for the All-Academic Big Eight team in 1991."
"Gilbert grew up in Detroit, Michigan with parents Leroy and Ann Brown, older brother Wes, and younger siblings, Sheri, Tommy and Anna (all of whom went to college and became athletes). Like Leroy, Gilbert was athletic and fast. Even his brothers could not run home before Gilbert if he was craving a biscuit."
"During his career at Mackenzie High School, he recorded 189 tackles and 19 sacks. His senior year culminated in all-state honors. Brown also lettered in track, competing in the shot put. He graduated from high school in 1989."
"Back in high school, Gilbert never looked at big-time football factories such as Michigan. He wanted to get away from what he saw in Detroit. He wanted a quiet, smaller environment in which to live after one of his classmates was gunned down. So he turned down Bo Schembechler and the University of Michigan to go to a school known for its powerful basketball program, and not for its football ability: the University of Kansas. The Kansas Jayhawks coach Glen Mason said, ""The very first play of the first drill, he goes up against a lineman and he absolutely demolished him. We just looked around at each other."""
"With the Jayhawks, Brown helped build a winning program along with fellow defensive lineman and future NFL first round pick Dana Stubblefield (Kansas went to the Aloha Bowl in '92). But Brown went through more difficult times during his college years: a friend Brown had just met on campus died unexpectedly of spinal meningitis, and Brown's father died of congestive heart failure during Brown's senior year."
"He started all but 2 games in four seasons at the University of Kansas (1989–92), and was tied for sixth in school history in tackles by a defensive lineman with 168, fifth in career tackles for loss with 30, and had 7½ career sacks. He finished second on the team in sacks, tackles for loss and fumbles recovered in 1991 while helping the Jayhawks hold opponents to an average of 150.9 yards per game on the ground, which was the best run defense at Kansas since 1968 at the time. A year earlier, as a sophomore, was named as the Jayhawks’ ‘Co-Defensive Most Valuable Player’ and earned second team All-Big Eight Conference recognition. Brown started nine games at nose guard as a freshman...An All-Academic Big Eight selection in 1991."
"He came up with the ""Gravedigger"" move at Kansas—after a big defensive hit, he would dig an imaginary grave, which became his trademark and nickname."
He majored in human development.
"Brown was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings in the third round of the 1993 NFL Draft (79th overall pick), but was waived during the final roster cutdowns on August 30, 1993 in his first training camp due to his weight. He was listed at 315 in college, but showed up to Vikings camp at a hefty 355. But the Packers, desperate then for defensive linemen, picked him up on August 31. Brown played in just two games that season while he worked off some of his weight in practice. In 1994, he played but his season was cut short with a torn Anterior cruciate ligament. Again in 1995, he played, but an elbow injury cut that season short. In 1996, he started all 16 games next to Santana Dotson, Sean Jones and Reggie White, a defensive unit that allowed a league record low 19 touchdowns. Brown had a career-high 51 tackles, and his first complete 16 game season."
"Brown became a fan favorite, partly because he was easy to spot, and partly because of his eccentric gravedigger dance. During the 1996 season, it became known that Brown would regularly order the ""Gilbertburger"" — a Double Whopper with extra everything, cut in half with extra cheese, no pickles — always obtained from the Oneida Street Burger King in Green Bay. Burger King even made it available for a short time as a promotion in Wisconsin Burger King restaurants."
"Brown was a highly sought after free agent after the 1996 season, but he elected to take a pay cut to stay with the Packers. On February 18, 1997, he signed a three-year, $8.25 million contract, which was 10 times his 1996 salary, but was about $1 million less than the offer he received from Jacksonville. He said that he would rather stay with the team and fans that he knew and loved."
"Many people thought that he started getting bigger around that time, and thought that he was as high as 360 or 375, much higher than his listed 345. ""That was outrageous, I never got that big,"" said Brown. ""The biggest I ever got up to was maybe 350, something like that."" But the Packers were fine with his size. Despite his weight, he posted three sacks during the 1997 season, which tied his career high from 1994."
"After playing all 16 games during the 1998 and 1999 seasons, he spent the 2000 season out of football after his contract with the Packers was not renewed. Before the 2001 training camp, he worked out and lived for a time with Fred Roll, his former strength and conditioning coach at the University of Kansas, and subsequently returned to Green Bay for training camp in July at a perceptibly more svelte 339 pounds — and once again equipped with his former quickness. He was re-signed by the Packers on March 23, 2001, after which Brown announced, ""If I didn’t think I could do this anymore, I wouldn't be here""."
"Brown had two good years after his return to football. However, he ruptured a biceps during the 2003 pre-season, but played on without having surgery. He recorded 14 tackles, one fumble recovery (the first of his career) and one pass defensed. In a victory over Chicago (Dec. 7), Brown posted a season-high four stops, along with a pass breakup."
"On March 2, 2004, the Packers released Brown. He had played 125 Packers games (103 starts) with 292 tackles (186 solo) and seven sacks. He also played in 15 Packers playoff games. In franchise history, only Brett Favre (22), Mason Crosby (18) and Aaron Rodgers (16) have more."
"Gilbert was featured in the ""Sports Illustrated"" special, ""Where Are They Now?"", featuring former professional athletes and what they are up to. Brown is currently a co-owner of the Milwaukee Mile, a racetrack that is often used for NASCAR races and at one time was the Packers' part-time home field. Gilbert even claims that he will occasionally fit his massive frame inside a race car and take a few laps."
"Gilbert, with the strong influence of his mother and family, felt that he wanted to give something back to the community, so he started his foundation which helps inner-city kids, and many other causes such as Breast Cancer and Make A Wish. In 2002, he combined his love for cars with his desire to give back when he organized a car show, Gilbert Brown and Friends, in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin, which benefited the Make-a-Wish Foundation."
"Galesville, Wisconsin establishment Champions Sports Bar and Grill has a burger named in Brown's honor: the Gravedigger burger, which weighs in at 93 ounces (just over 5¾ lbs). The weight of the burger is a callback to Brown's jersey number, which was 93."
"On October 23, 2007, the Milwaukee Bonecrushers of the Continental Indoor Football League announced that Brown had signed a three-year contract to be the team's new head coach. The Bonecrushers began their season in March. However On Tuesday, April 8, 2008, Gilbert Brown resigned as head coach of the Milwaukee Bonecrushers citing irreconcilable differences with ownership."
"On December 11, 2007, the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame, Inc., Tuesday announced Brown would be inducted into the Hall at the 38th Hall of Fame Induction Banquet, to be held the evening of July 19, 2008, in the Lambeau Field Atrium."
"On August 6, 2009, it was announced that Brown would return to coaching as the first head coach of the expansion La Crosse Spartans of the Indoor Football League."
"On April 1, 2011, Brown announced he was taking a leave of absence from the La Crosse Spartans."
"As of Aug. 2011, Brown is the head coach of the Green Bay Chill of the Lingerie Football League, which was later renamed as the Legends Football League."

"Dinaw Mengestu was born in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. In 1978, during a period of political repression that became known as the Red Terror, his father, who was an executive with Ethiopian Airlines, applied for political asylum while on a business trip in Italy; Mengestu's mother was pregnant with him at the time. Two years later, when Mengestu was a toddler, he, his mother and his sister were reunited with his father in the United States. The family settled in Peoria, Illinois, where Mengestu's father at first worked as a factory laborer, before rising to a management position. Later the family moved to the Chicago area, where Mengestu graduated from Fenwick High School in Oak Park, Illinois."
"Mengestu received his B.A. in English from Georgetown University, and his MFA in writing from Columbia University in 2005."
"Mengestu's début novel, ""The Beautiful Things That Heaven Bears"", was published in the United States in March 2007 by Penguin Riverhead. It was published in the United Kingdom as ""Children of the Revolution"", issued in May 2007 by Jonathan Cape. It tells the story of Sepha Stephanos, who fled the warfare of the Ethiopian Revolution 17 years before and immigrated to the United States. He owns and runs a failing grocery store in Logan Circle, then a poor African-American section of Washington, D.C. that is becoming gentrified. He and two fellow African immigrants, all of them single, deal with feelings of isolation and nostalgia for home. Stephanos becomes involved with a white woman and her daughter, who move into a renovated house in the neighborhood."

Sphinx is a fulltext F/OSS search engine that provides text search functionality to client applications.
"Sphinx can be used either as a stand-alone server or as a storage engine (""SphinxSE"") for the MySQL family of databases."
"When run as a standalone server Sphinx operates similar to a DBMS and can communicate with MySQL, MariaDB and PostgreSQL through their native protocols or with any ODBC-compliant DBMS via ODBC."
"MariaDB, a fork of MySQL, is distributed with SphinxSE."
"If Sphinx is run as a stand-alone server, it is possible to use SphinxAPI to connect an application to it. Official implementations of the API are available for PHP, Java, Perl, Ruby and Python languages. Unofficial implementations for other languages, as well as various third party plugins and modules are also available. Other data sources can be indexed via pipe in a custom XML format."
"The Sphinx search daemon supports the MySQL binary network protocol and can be accessed with the regular MySQL API and/or clients. Sphinx supports a subset of SQL known as SphinxQL. It supports standard querying of all index types with SELECT, modifying RealTime indexes with INSERT, REPLACE, and DELETE, and more."
"Sphinx can also provide a special storage engine for MariaDB and MySQL databases. This allows those MySQL, MariaDB to communicate with Sphinx's codice_1 to run queries and obtain results. Sphinx indices are treated like regular SQL tables."
"Sphinx is configured to examine a data set via its Indexer. The Indexer process creates a full-text index (a special data structure that enables quick keyword searches) from the given data/text. Full-text fields are the resulting content that is indexed by Sphinx; they can be (quickly) searched for keywords. Fields are named, and you can limit your searches to a single field (e.g. search through ""title"" only) or a subset of fields (e.g. to ""title"" and ""abstract"" only). Sphinx's index format generally supports up to 256 fields. Note that the original data is not stored in the Sphinx index, but are discarded during the Indexing process; Sphinx assumes that you store those contents elsewhere."
Attributes are additional values associated with each document that can be used to perform additional filtering and sorting during search. Attributes are named. Attribute names are case insensitive. Attributes are not full-text indexed; they are stored in the index as is. Currently supported attribute types are:

"Sphinx, like classic SQL databases, works with a so-called fixed schema, that is, a set of predefined attribute columns. These work well when most of the data stored actually has values: mapping sparse data to static columns can be cumbersome. Assume for example that you’re running a price comparison or an auction site with many different products categories. Some of the attributes like the price or the vendor are identical across all goods. But from there, for laptops, you also need to store the weight, screen size, HDD type, RAM size, etc. And, say, for shovels, you probably want to store the color, the handle length, and so on. So it’s manageable across a single category, but all the distinct fields that you need for all the goods across all the categories are legion. The JSON field can be used to overcome this. Inside the JSON attribute you don’t need a fixed structure. You can have various keys which may or may not be present in all documents. When you try to filter on one of these keys, Sphinx will ignore documents that don’t have the key in the JSON attribute and will work only with those documents that have it."

"Mediated communication is not as commonly used as face-to-face communication in the workplace, but there are different preferred media of communication for simple forms of coordination. E-mails and phone calls tend to be used for simple or complex coordination, but e-mails are also useful for retaining information and recording the exchange of information. In terms of communication solutions to certain situational factors, e-mails are used for recording the transfer of information and sending long, complex, and non-textual information, and phone calls and pagers are used for immediate communication. E-mails and phone calls are also used in knowledge sharing and information gathering. E-mails are rarely used to accomplish relationship goals, but they are used for conflict resolution. Individuals have a higher motivation to use cell-phone texting for weak-tie communication. The network effect has the most impact on e-mail, meaning that people tend to use e-mail more if their peers use it, too."
Email
"Electronic mail is digital mechanism for exchanging messages through internet or intranet communication platforms. The first message that was sent through a computer was on October 29, 1969. Raymond Tomlinson is known as the father of email, he was the first person who sent a message electronically. Email messages consist of three different components: message envelope, message header, and message body. There are also multiple benefits to using email. It is easy to use, free of charge, fast, and delivers information in a digital format. Email is one of the earliest and most basic resources on the internet and those many computers may not be able to access other internet services they are still usually able to exchange emails with machines on the internet. There are many reasons why using email is more suitable when it comes to the workforce. the first reason is because it is faster than a conventional mail so that usually reaches its destination and minutes even when it's sent from different countries. Another reason why an email is more conventional is because of the fact that there is less physical efforts .while using email you don't have to worry about buying stamps or envelopes or taking a trip to the post office. Also the use of email helps in the financial state because once you have gotten the hardware and software together it is basically free from there on. Email messaging also helps when having to send the same message to multiple people because of the fact that it allows you to send the same information simultaneously."
Text message
"A text message is defined as a short message sent electronically usually from one cellphone to another. The first text message was sent in December 3, 1992. The engineer that discovered text messaging was named Matti Makkonen. Along with the development of text messaging came a new development of dialogue when texting. As I stated in while texting people tend to exaggerate how they usually talk. An example of this or shown in blank where somebody may state that ""this homework is so hard I'm going to kill myself!!"" This dialogue is normal and texting but not entirely appropriate and other scenarios. Another thing that texting changed was a person's grammar or writing style. In it showed that 75% of friends noted that their best friends grammar or writing styles. Though only 25% of acquaintances noticed that their friends grammar or writing styles had changed. The evolution of texting is evolving and its uses it is not only being used to communicate with friends and family but it is also spreading to the workforce. According to in Zambia they are finding the results of HIV testing faster due to mobile phone texting. The turnaround time for results notifying went from health facilities reporting the results in 44.2 days pre-implementation to 26.7 days post inflammation due to texting. They developed a customized software built to deliver the test results automatically and directly from the processing laboratory to the health facilities of sample origin via short text message service text."

"In addition, common Fulani were inspired by Adama's exploits and formed into bands. Adama created a new position for their leaders: The ""lamido"" (plural: ""lamibe""), who was the leader of a particular territory, as opposed to an ardo, leader of a particular people. Both groups received flags of command and shared the same status in Adama's armies. Before his death, Adama would appoint over 40 non-ardo lamibe. They would prove his most loyal lieutenants."
"Adama turned his attentions on the only major state in Fumbina that could present a threat to his fledgling emirate: Mandara. It was an attractive target. It lay between Bornu to the north and Baghirmi in the Chad Basin, so its fall would facilitate the conquest of these areas. Its people were already Muslim, though they mixed the religion with pagan practices. Moreover, it had a large population from whom soldiers could be conscripted, and it was renowned for its excellent horses. Mandara was well organised, however, and would not be an easy prize. The people who lived there, the Mandarawa, had a long-standing rivalry with the Fulani, who had fought them under the Bornu in previous years. This animosity only served to drive more Fulani to Adama's armies, though, as many veterans were eager for another crack at an old rival. Furthermore, Fulbe rulers Modibo Damraka and others were already embroiled in fighting against the Mandara in the Diamaré Plain. Sentiment for jihad was high."
"Adama reached Guringa in 1809 with a large army in good morale. He quickly conquered the Mandara settlement at Guider and headed north, taking several more villages along the way. Outside of the Mandara capital, Dulo, Adama demanded that the king, Bukar Djiama, swear his allegiance and convert to Islam untainted with paganism. Bukar agreed to acknowledged Adama's right to rule his own subjects, but he refused to yield his own sovereignty. Adama and his men took Dulo with little fighting."
"Adama searched for someone to rule the settlement, but he found no one whom he felt adequate for the post. Meanwhile, his troops revelled in their plunder. No one expected the Mandara counterattack, which was launched from nearby Mora. Adama fled the town, and Dulo fell from his grasp forever."
"Adama and his men retreated to Yola (in present-day Nigeria). The town would become his capital by 1841. From here, he and his lieutenants continued to expand the emirate, which he named Adamawa after himself. The subordinates had to send him tribute in the form of cattle. Large settlements such as Maroua, Garoua, and Ngaoundéré fell to Adama or his lieutenants. By 1825, the Fulani had penetrated the Adamawa Plateau. Nevertheless, Adama lived in relatively moderate surroundings and never acquired great wealth."
"From Yola, Adama began the administrative tasks necessary for his nascent state. He did this with Usman's advice; he was to foster understanding between his people and their governors, facilitate communication between elders and their subordinates, and prevent the stratification of society based on class or wealth. The empire eventually took on three administrative tiers. At the centre was the ""emir al-Mu'minin"" (""commander of the faithful""), Adama himself, ruling from Yola and answering only to Usman dan Fodio in Sokoto. A contingent of councillors and administrators directly aided him, and a household staff of non-Fulbe and slaves doubled as his bodyguard. Below him were a number of district leaders, the lamibe, who ruled key settlements. Under them were a number of villages, each headed by a village chief."
"Meanwhile, some of the older ardo'en grew powerful through their own conquests. They regarded the unconquered areas near their territories as their own private backyards and defended these zones from all comers. This sometimes surfaced in their relations with Adama, such as when Bouba Njida of Rai refused to come to Adama's aid when the emir was fighting the Namchi at Poli. Instead, Bouba waited for Adama to retreat from the area to bring in his own forces and finish the enemy off. He then sent prisoners from the battle to Adama as a gift."
"Adama died in 1847 and was laid to rest at Yola (his tomb survives to this day). Adamawa covered 103,000 km² from Lake Chad to Banyo and was inhabited by 1,500,000 people. Further expansion to the south had proved difficult and undesirable since the presence of the tsetse fly and thick jungle made cattle rearing difficult there."
"Adama's son Muhammadu Lawal succeeded him after a brief regency under Hamidu bi Adama. Eventually, three of Adama's other sons would at some point serve as Emir of Adamawa. Not until the British and German colonial periods would the emirate come to an end."
"Despite their loss of independence, the Fulani were now the preeminent ethnic group of Northern Cameroon. They spread Islam throughout the region, establishing it as the dominant religion. Education also flourished, as new converts learned Arabic writing and studied the Qur'an. Trade flourished, and communications with it. The conquests were also important ecologically. Lands that had once been used for cultivation now became part of Fulani pastureland. Herdsmen cut down trees to make way for cattle, and they burned grasses that their herds later trampled. Centuries of such behaviour have replaced the region's forest with savanna."
"Ironically, the Adamawa was more sparsely populated after Adama's conquest. Rather than fight the Fulani invaders, many peoples fled, displacing others in turn. The Adamawa Plateau, once home to many of Cameroon's ethnic groups, soon became a pastureland, and the forest zone of Cameroon became more heavily populated."

"Mysterious Traveller is the fourth studio album by the jazz ensemble Weather Report and was released in 1974. This was their final recording with founding bassist Miroslav Vitouš, who left due to creative differences. Vitouš was replaced by Alphonso Johnson. Another addition to the line-up is drummer Ishmael Wilburn. Greg Errico was the drummer for the tour between the previously released ""Sweetnighter"" and this album, but declined an invitation to be a permanent member of the band."
"The record is the band's first that predominantly uses electric bass and incorporates liberal uses of funk, R&B grooves, and rock that would later be hallmarked as the band's ""signature"" sound. Also, the more restricted compositional format became evident on this album, replacing the more ""open improvisation"" formats used on the first three albums. It was voted as the album of the year by the readers of ""Down Beat"" for 1974, garnering Weather Report's second overall win in that category, also garnering a five-star review from that publication along the way."
"The album peaked at #2 in the ""Billboard"" Jazz album chart, #31 in the R&B album chart, and #46 in the ""Billboard"" 200 chart."
"Early copies of the album do not list ""Cucumber Slumber"" on the back cover or inner sleeve, and list ""Jungle Book"" as the final track of side one rather than side two.

= = = Maria Taferl = = =
"Maria Taferl is an Austrian market municipality of 872 people in the District of Melk and the most important pilgrimage site in all of Lower Austria. After Mariazell, Maria Taferl is the most important pilgrimage destination in all of Austria."
"Maria Taferl is located in the Nibelungengau in Lower Austria on a bank over the Danube. 47.48 percent of the municipality is forested. As the Maria Taferl Market, which takes place on the so-called ""Taferlberg"" (""Taferl Mountain""), the remaining districts are found in the hilly surrounding area. To the south, the basilica is widely visible throughout the town."
"Little is known about the early settlement of Maria Taferl. The Celtic Kingdom of Noricum was located on the northern shore of the Danube. During Roman times, the Danube served as the border of the Province of Noricum. Even today in the church plaza, there is a stone of Celtic origin, on which heathen sacrifices were made. This attests to Maria Taferl's long tradition as a place of religious activity."
"Maria Taferl and the surrounding countryside belonged to the territory of the Ostarrichi during the time of the Bambergs in the Middle Ages. It then became part of the Habsburg holdings. For a long time, it was part of the land of the Lords of Weißenberg, whose seat lay in the nearby town of Münichreith. It is assumed that the various districts of the town were already established during the Middle Ages. The history of the modern market of Maria Taferl begins in the 17th century."
"The first church was built around a shrine to the Holy Mother, which is the origin of the name ""Maria Taferl."" The legends say that the statue of the Pietà at the shrine was an offering from Alexander Schinagel, a forester, who had a miraculous recovery from a serious illness. It replaced a crucifix there, which had also been the site of a miracle, for when local shepherd Thomas Pachmann tried to chop down the oak on which it was placed, he gravely injured both his legs. After a prayer to the Virgin Mary, his almost fatal wounds stopped bleeding. The old oak was destroyed by fire in 1755, which also damaged the statue."
The church building was built from 1660 to 1710. Its construction was begun under the imperial architect Georg Gerstenbrand and the Italian Carlo Lurago. Its famous cupola was built by Jakob Prandtauer from 1708 to 1710. He also designed the current appearance of Melk Abbey. The Maria Taferl church is built in the baroque style with ample amounts of gold leaf and a frescoed ceiling. In the center of the high altar is the namesake Marian stature. The building's rear houses its crypt.
"According to an inscription in the building's interior, the building of the church gave the local inhabitants new courage after the Plague, the Turkish Wars, and the Thirty Years' War had all taken their toll. It also supported the ideas of the Counter-Reformation in the heartland of the Catholic House of Habsburg. All this speaks to Maria Taferl as an important manifestation of the Catholic faith on the main traveling route of the Danube."
"There are many traditional stories of angelic processions here, which come from the 17th century. The tradition of pilgrimage to Maria Taferl also dates back to that time. In 1760 alone, there were 700 pilgrimage processions and over 19,000 masses said there. The church is also a kind of information treasure chest about its pilgrims, their origins, and their number. Within it are the gifts of the pilgrims, who came on account of illness and were cured. Another reason for Maria Taferl's importance as a pilgrimage destination was the stone cross, a gift from the citizens of Freistadt for pilgrims who died on the journey. It is also evidence of the exhausting nature of pilgrimage in those days. The murdered Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his family lived in the nearby Artstetten Castle and is known to have regularly attended mass at Maria Taferl."
"Maria Taferl became a ""Basilica minor"" in 1947."
"By 2010, the basilica's interior should have undergone a complete restoration. It will then celebrate a double jubilee: 350 years since the laying of its cornerstone in 1660, and 300 years since its completion in 1710. The interior's last restoration was around 50 ago; the exterior was restored in 1982, and in 1998, the domes of the two towers were re-covered."
"Besides the basilica, in Maria Taferl there is also a monument for the Fallen of both World Wars. These men are honored annually at meeting of veteran's groups."
There is a folk belief that the water from the well at Maria Taferl can help with eye complaints.
"Other landmarks in the town are the Elementary School Museum, as well as the mechanical nativity, which tells the story of Maria Taferl's origins."
The municipality of Maria Taferl is divided into seven districts:
The mayor of Maria Taferl is Herbert Gruber and the Chief Officer is Daniela Lahmer. In the Municipal Council the 15 seats went to the following parties: ÖVP 10 and SPÖ 5.
"After agriculture, tourism is the most important economic activity in Maria Taferl."
"WPBF presently broadcasts 39½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with six hours each weekday, five hours on Saturdays and 4½ hours on Sundays)."
"Initially, WPBF had a small news department as it did not plan to launch one until after it received the ABC affiliation. After being purchased by Paxson Communications, the station added additional newscasts to its schedule. For a long time they struggled with ratings in their own market, which is attributable to WPLG's very strong over-the-air signal in Palm Beach County and its availability on Comcast throughout the area. However with Hearst's traditional hard news focus on their stations soon instituted within WPBF's news operation, WPBF eventually became a spirited second place news operation, and WPBF usually outranks WPEC currently in most timeslots (NBC affiliate WPTV has been well dominant in the market for years)."
"On July 12, 2006, it started airing a half-hour newscast called ""Weather First at 4"" on weekdays becoming the first station in West Palm Beach to do so. While the main intention of the new broadcast was to cover West Palm Beach area weather, news updates and headlines were added after a short time. This production is streamed live on their website. On July 17, 2006, WPBF added thirty minutes to its weekday morning show which began airing at 5:30. It became a full two-hour broadcast on January 28, 2008. The station debuted a new traffic reporting system featuring data from Traffic.com on February 14 that included a new traffic segment, ""Beat the Traffic"", seen on weekdays."
"Expansion of local news continued with the launch of a weekend morning newscast on March 8. On August 18, 2008, WPBF began broadcasting a broadcast at noon during the week which is also streamed live on its website. On September 14, 2009, the station debuted a new logo, set, and graphics package while expanding the 4 p.m. newscast to an hour. WPBF dropped weeknight newscasts in the 5 p.m. hour to make room for ""Dr. Phil"" which had moved to the station from WPTV; that change has since been reverted, for as of September 12, 2011, ""The Dr. Oz Show"" replaced the 4 p.m. newscast."
"Until October 4, 2010, WPBF was the only channel in the West Palm Beach market that did not offer newscasts in high definition or even enhanced definition widescreen. However, WPBF was operating HD-ready studios and field cameras for its broadcasts. The shows were displayed in pillarboxed standard definition while showing the station's logo and ""HD"" in the left and right thirds of the screen. On October 4 starting with the weeknight 4 p.m. newscast, WPBF started broadcasting local news in high definition. Upon the upgrade, it began using an updated music package and slightly revised HD graphics previously used by sister station WESH in Orlando. In December 2012, WPBF upgraded their graphics package to the new Hearst Television graphics along with new music and talent opens. However, like another sister station, KSBW in Salinas, California, HD is not mentioned in the news openings. WPBF will also continue to display HD in the left and right thirds of the screen when video footage is shown in 4:3 standard definition. The station does not currently operate a sports department which is unusual for both a big three network channel and a Hearst-owned station."

"Marjorie Celeste Champion (née Belcher; born September 2, 1919) is an American dancer and actress. At a young age, she was hired as a dance model for Walt Disney Studios animated films. Later, she performed as an actress and dancer in film musicals, and in 1957 had a TV show based on song and dance. She has also done creative choreography for liturgy, and served as a dialogue and movement coach for the 1978 TV miniseries, ""The Awakening Land"", set in the late 18th century in the Ohio Valley."
"Marge Champion was born as Marjorie Celeste Belcher on September 2, 1919, in Los Angeles, California, to Hollywood dance director Ernest Belcher and his wife, Gladys Lee Baskette (née Rosenberg). She had an older half sister, Lina Basquette, who already was acting in silent films at the age of twelve. Lina was the daughter of her mother's first husband, Frank Baskette, who had committed suicide."
"Marjorie began dancing at an early age as her sister had done. She began dancing as a child under the instruction of her father, Ernest Belcher, a noted Hollywood ballet coach who trained Shirley Temple, Cyd Charisse, and Gwen Verdon. She studied exclusively with her father from age five until she left for New York. She credits her good health and long career to her father's teaching principles: careful, strict progression of activity, emphasis on correct alignment, precise placement of body, attention to detail and to the totality of dynamics and phrasing. Her first dance partner was Louis Hightower. In 1930, she made her debut in the Hollywood Bowl at age 11 in the ballet ""Carnival in Venice"". By age twelve, she became a ballet instructor at her father's studio. She was hired by The Walt Disney Studio as a dance model for their animated film ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" (1937). Her movements were copied to enhance the realism of the animated Snow White figure."
"In 1937, Marge Belcher married Art Babbitt (1907–1992), a top animator at Disney and creator of Goofy. They divorced in 1940."
"In 1947, she married dancer Gower Champion (1919–1980). They had two sons, Blake and actor Gregg Champion. They divorced in January 1973. Belcher met Gower when she was 12 years old in the ninth grade at Bancroft Junior High and that's when their romance started. Although performances often took them away from California, Los Angeles remained their home base."
"In 1977, she married director Boris Sagal. Sagal was killed on May 22, 1981, in an accident during the production of the miniseries ""World War III"". She became stepmother to Boris' five children, who include Katey, Jean, Liz, and Joey."
"The very first picture Belcher remembers being in was ""The Castles"" with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. This gave her a feeling that she would really like to do movies but what she really wanted to do was go to New York and be in New York shows. Sadly, Belcher wasn't tall enough not even for ballet, which is what she trained all her life for."
"Together as a dance team, the Champions performed in MGM musicals of the 1940s and 50s, including their first MGM musical ""Till the Clouds Roll By"" (1946), ""Show Boat"" (1951) and ""Everything I Have Is Yours"" (1952). Other films with Gower included ""Mr. Music"" (1950, with Bing Crosby), ""Give a Girl a Break"" (1953), ""Jupiter's Darling"" (1955), and ""Three for the Show"" (1955). MGM wanted the couple to remake Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers films, but only one, ""Lovely to Look At"" (1952), a remake of ""Roberta"" (1935), was completed. The couple refused to remake any of the others, the rights to which were still owned by RKO."
"Gower and Marge Champion appeared as the Mystery Guests on the May 15, 1955 airing of ""What's My Line"". Mary Healy guessed who they were."
"During the summer of 1957, the Champions had their own TV series, ""The Marge and Gower Champion Show"", a situation comedy with song and dance numbers. Marge played a dancer and Gower a choreographer. Real-life drummer Buddy Rich was featured as a fictional drummer named Cozy."
"In the 1970s, Champion, actress Marilee Zdenek, and choreographer John West were part of a team at Bel Aire Presbyterian Church that created a number of creative worship services featuring dance and music. They later offered workshops and related liturgical arts programs throughout the country. She and Zdenek co-authored two books, ""Catch the New Wind"" and ""God Is a Verb"", related to this work."
"In 1978 she served as a dialogue and movement coach for the TV miniseries, ""The Awakening Land"", adapted from Conrad Richter's trilogy of the same name. It was set in the late 18th-century Ohio Valley."
"Champion has also worked as a dance instructor and choreographer in New York City. In 1982, she made a rare television acting appearance on the dramatic TV series ""Fame"", playing a ballet teacher with a racial bias against African-American students."
"Champion appeared in several stage musicals and plays on Broadway as a performer. She made her New York debut in ""What's Up"" (1943). She also performed in the ""Dark of the Moon"" (1945) as the Fair Witch, and ""Beggar's Holiday"" (1946) having multiple roles. She made her last Broadway appearance in ""3 for Tonight"" in 1955. She also worked as a choreographer or Assistant, including ""Lend an Ear"" in 1948 as assistant to the Choreographer; ""Make a Wish"" in 1951, as assistant to Gower Champion; ""Hello, Dolly!"" in 1964 as special assistant; and ""Stepping Out"" (1987) as choreographic associate. In 2001, she appeared as Emily Whitman in the Broadway stage revival of ""Follies""."
"Champion states ""as a dancer, by the time you're 40 you're done. If I ever come back, I want to be an actress- it lasts long. But I was 81 when I was in ""Follies""."

"The featherweight class in the boxing at the 1964 Summer Olympics competition was the third-lightest class. Featherweights were limited to those boxers weighing less than 57 kilograms. The competition was held from October 13, 1964 to October 23, 1964. 32 boxers from 32 nations competed."
"The bridge was a masterpiece of Victorian-era engineering. For its time, it was a highly sophisticated structure. It astonished the local population, many of whom had had little exposure to such state-of-the-art engineering work."
"Very quickly, urban legends began to spread."
"Some of these unfounded “tall tales”, (which are sometimes repeated to this day), are:"
"Of course, there is no truth in any of these stories. The bridge was constructed as planned; von Rieppel’s complex calculations, (all carried out without the aid of computers or arithmetic aids), were correct – he died about 30 years later after an unrelated illness."
"What might be true are rumours about Emperor Wilhelm II's boycott of the inauguration ceremony. According to legend, the Emperor was annoyed that such a state-of-art structure was named after his grandfather, Wilhelm I, not after himself. He therefore decided not to attend the celebrations in person."
"What is true is that the bridge has attracted an unknown, but large number of suicides during its more than 100-year existence."
"= = = Eldol, Consul of Gloucester = = ="
"Eldol was Consul or Count of Gloucester in Geoffrey of Monmouth's circa 1136 work ""Historia Regum Britanniae"" (""The History of the Kings of Britain""). In this pseudohistory he was the sole British leader to escape from the massacre of Salisbury, to which Hengist had invited all of the British Leaders to a peace treaty. When all of the leaders were there, about 460 in number, Hengest ordered his men to draw their long knives and kill every leader. Vortigern was spared, but every other ruler was slain, save Eldol, who grabbed a stick up off the ground and killed 70 men in his escape."
"After the massacre, Eldol was a key supporter of Aurelius Ambrosius and helped him defeat the Saxons. Eldol defeated Hengist in hand-to-hand combat at the battle at Kaerconan/Cunungeburc, which may be the town of Conisbrough, and beheaded him. He was also at the siege of Vortigern's tower. Eldad, Bishop of Gloucester, was his brother."
"Thomas Rudge gives an account in his 1811 ""The History and Antiquities of Gloucester"":"
"Eldol, or Edel, a Briton, is said to have been Earl of Gloucester in 461; he was, according to the account of Robert of Gloucester, and other historians, a knight of great prowess. He attended King Vortigern at the treaty of Ambresbury in Wiltshire, to which they were invited by Hengist, the Saxon, with the express stipulation that neither party should go thither armed; but the Saxons having, contrary to their engagement, concealed long knives under their clothes, murdered great numbers of the Britons. Eldol is said at this time to have exerted himself so powerfully with a stake he happened to find, as to slay no less than seventy of the Saxons, and after having disabled many more, he escaped to Gloucester, his own city. He is also said to have behaved with uncommon courage, in a subsequent battle between Ambrosius, King of the Britons, and Hengist, when ... he rushed through the Pagan army, took Hengist prisoner, and cut off his head."
"It is not stated whether Morvid, Consul of Gloucester during King Arthur's reign in the ""Historia Regum Britanniae"", is related to Eldol."
"In later Welsh legend, Eldol became Eidol or Eidiol 'Gadarn' ('Mighty'), recorded as one of the three strong men of Britain, having, at the meeting on Salisbury plain, slain 660 Saxons with a billet of wood."
"There was a Welsh hero Eidiol mentioned in ""The Gododdin"" who may have inspired the use of the name in Geoffrey's work."
He should not be confused with King Eldol who lives generations earlier in Geoffrey's work.
"Eldol and Eldad have minor roles in the 1970 novel ""The Crystal Cave"" by Mary Stewart. After the battle with Hengist, one of Ambrosius's men says to Merlin, ""... old Eldad laid about him [i.e., fought well] with the best of them. Did you see him?"" Merlin replies wryly, ""I heard him."""

"Yidl Mitn Fidl (, ""Yiddle With His Fiddle"", ), is a 1936 musical Yiddish film."
"Arye and his daughter Itke are musicians, or ""klezmorim"", who became impoverished and were evicted from their home in Kazimierz Dolny. Arie sees no choice but to embark on a career of a travelling band, but fears for the safety of his daughter on the dangerous roads. Itke solves the problem by disguising herself as a boy and adopts the persona of ""Yidl"", ostensibly Arie's son."
"During their voyages, they meet another pair of merrymakers, the father-and-son duo Isaac and Ephraim Kalamutker, with whom they form a quartet and roam through the Polish countryside seeking engagements. ""Yidl"" falls in love with Ephraim, who is utterly oblivious to the true sex of his companion. The four are hired to perform in the wedding of young Teibele to the old, rich man Zalman Gold. The bride had to cancel her prior engagement with her true love, Yosl Fedlman, for her late father left many unpaid debts. Yidl takes pity on Teibele and the quartet smuggle her out of the party and have her join them as vocalist. To Yidl's dismay, Ephraim is enamored with the young woman. Itke reveals her true self to Isaac, who determines to assist her and leaves to locate Yosl."
"When arriving in Warsaw, the group become a success and are hired to perform in a concert. However, personal tensions between the members run high. Efraim signs a contract with a local orchestra. Teibele's lost match finally arrives, and they run off together before the show. Yidl, quite by accident, takes her place and recounts her entire story and love for Efraim in song form. She is applauded and signed on a contract for a career in the United States. Having learned the truth, Efraim abandons his commitments and joins her on the ship to New York."
"After the success of ""Joseph in the Land of Egypt"", a silent film dubbed into the Yiddish language by Joseph Green, met with success, he decided to create an entirely Yiddish film, and returned to his native Poland to do so. ""Yidl Mitn Fidl"" was the most successful Yiddish film of all time and the most popular of Green's films as well."
"The film was shot on location in Kazimierz Dolny, Poland, with local inhabitants as extras. Based on a novella by Konrad Tom, the screenplay was written by Green. Its score was composed by Abraham Ellstein, and the lyrics to the songs were written by Itzik Manger. Jakob Jonilowicz was the photo director of the film."
"It was filmed in Poland to minimize costs: the total budget was $50,000. Picon was contemplating entering English-language entertainment and had to be paid an astronomical fee in terms of Yiddish cinema, $10,000 or a fifth of the entire expenditure, to star in the main role. Besides her, all actors were Polish. The film turned into a resounding commercial success and covered the producers' expenses even before opening in the United States. When it premiered in the Ambassador movie theatre, Frank S. Nugent wrote in the ""New York Times"": ""It must be set down to her credit that, despite the fact that there is not a single new thing in the whole bag of tricks emptied on the screen, Miss Picon puts so much infectious gayety, not forgetting the proper modicum of sadness, into the action that the result is genuine entertainment."" It was exported to most of Western Europe, Australia and South Africa, and was screened in the British Mandate of Palestine with Hebrew dubbing. In Britain, it opened at Academy Cinema, Oxford Street, on 21 July 1937. The picture was exported outside of London and was quite a success; In a review for ""Night and Day"" from 29 July 1937, Graham Greene wrote of ""Yiddle"": ""a story in which even the music seems to have the dignity and patina of age and race. An odd feeling of freedom pervades the film full of ugly people in bowler-hats strumming in courtyards... Freedom even from the closer tyranny of a well-made script, as if the whole picture were an impromptu performance, like the stories in the Decameron."" Several copies were sent to Nazi Germany, where Jews were not allowed to attend regular cinemas, and viewing was restricted to ""members of the Jewish Race."" Premiere in the hall of the Jüdischer Kulturbund took place on 2 May 1938, and it then ran in communities across Germany."
"In 1956, a remastered version, fully dubbed into English, was released in New York for a short run, bearing the title ""Castles in the Sky."""

"Sounds like Chicken also had rotation on the radio station Triple J, mainly with their double A-side single ""Take a Bullet to the Grave""/""El Chupanebre"" and their other single ""Global Domination""."
"After their breakup, SLC released all their previous recordings under Creative Commons (by-nc-sa), for free online distribution."
The band reformed for a once-off show on 11 May 2014 as a benefit for independent record store Fist2face.
"Sounds Like Chicken began in 1999 when Nathanael Kitingan (Nat Kitingan) met Nyall Dawson at Monash University in Melbourne. Nat and Nyall attempted to start an unnamed musical project with Hugh Ogilvy (also from Monash University) featuring Nyall on electric violin, Hugh on guitar and Nat on drums. This trio did not get off the ground and so brothers Joel and Elliot Dawson joined to form Sounds Like Chicken, a ska project taking influences from Voodoo Glow Skulls, The O.C. Supertones, The Insyderz and Five Iron Frenzy. This early lineup was Nyall (vocals), Nat (bass/vocals), Elliot (drums), Joel (sax) and Hugh (guitar)."
"Sounds Like Chicken's first show was at Joel's 21st birthday party in mid-2000. Hugh left the band at the end of 2000 due to other commitments and was replaced by Tom Dowding on guitar. Tom was an extremely accomplished bass player and so Nat decided to swap to playing guitar so that Tom's talent could be fully utilised. The band decided they needed another horn and so after a number of unsuccessful audition attempts, in 2001 Nat met Natalie Parker at university and invited her to a practice. Natalie was initially apprehensive but was eventually convinced by the boys to join the band. During her second practice she was already laying down trumpet tracks on their first demo recording which ended up becoming the band's self-made demo EP, ""Slowly Going the Way of the Chicken""."
"Sounds Like Chicken toured interstate for the first time under this lineup in September 2001, playing in Sydney and Canberra and also at the Black Stump Music Festival. In 2002, Tom Dowding departed from Sounds like Chicken to be replaced by Joshua Diemar on bass. It was in this year that Sounds Like Chicken released their first studio EP, ""I Am Gibbon, Hear Me Roar"", produced by David Carr (Antiskeptic, Taxiride). The EP gave the band airplay on community radio, Christian radio, and Triple J."
"In early 2004, the band were signed to Boomtown Records, a Melbourne-based indie record label distributing through Shock Records and MGM. Deciding that a bigger ensemble was required, Sounds Like Chicken asked long-time friend Dave Powys (ex Staff Discount and Never In Doubt) to join on second guitar, making them a 7-piece band. Dave moved down from Canberra and recorded on the single Global Domination, their first release with Boomtown and distributed through MGM. The single received national airplay and spot airplay on Triple J and was sold out within 2 months of its limited pressing. It was noted that producer Dave Carr's production was a big step up from previous releases."
"It was shortly after this that the band decided it was time to move on and the band was without a bass-player. They were booked in to record an album and so asked if Carlos Echeverria (ex Know Exit and Wishful Thinking) would fill in and record bass for them. Their first full-length album, ""...Like a Cannonball to the Ocean Floor"" was released late that year through Boomtown, also doing well on the airwaves. The album drew acclaim from reviewers as a ""brilliantly released debut album"", although the length of 17 tracks drew some criticism. Sounds Like Chicken did a joint national tour with label-mates Wishful Thinking to launch the album. Carlos officially joined shortly after the album's release."
"In early 2005 founding member and manager, Elliot, decided to part ways with the band. Mike ""Carcass"" Haydon (of Melbourne band ""The Knockabouts""), only 17 at the time, was able to fill the role of drummer. Mike had been a tour roadie for the band for the past 3 years and so was already well-acquainted with their songs. That year Sounds Like Chicken released the second double-A side single off the album, ""Take a Bullet to the Grave/El Chupanebre"" through Boomtown Records, and completed a national tour over 3 months to launch it."
"On 3 November 2006, founding member, Nyall Dawson, announced his decision to depart the band early in 2007."
Sounds Like Chicken have played and toured with numerous well-known Australian and international acts and have been featured on various international and Australian compilations and soundtracks such as Turn the Other Cheek Volume 1.
"On 18 December 2006 Sounds Like Chicken announced they were calling it a day in a bulletin released on the band's MySpace. The main factors in the breakup was the future departure of Nyall Dawson and other key members of the band, the band stated..."
"""""We guess it’s time for some of us to move on. There was other plans for our lives and with the impending departure of some key members, we felt that SLC would simply not be SLC if we went on without them. We all feel at peace about this decision."""""
"Shortly after, the band announced plans for an Australia wide farewell tour to take place in February–March 2007, along with the release of a final limited-edition compilation disk titled ""Death To The Crow"" to coincide with the tour."
"Sounds Like Chicken's final show was held at TLC Bayswater, Victoria on Saturday 17 March 2007."
The band's entire discography (except for Death To The Crow) was made available for free download on their website and on Jamendo
"In April 2007, former SLC members Mike Haydon, Dave Powys, Ben Hobson, Nat Kitingan and Joel Dawson together with new addition Paul McCasker formed reggae band San Salvador. They released an EP ""How To Hear"", two singles ""Like a Train"" and ""Spark the Fire"" and later the mini-album ""Rugged Are The Mountains""."
Former members Mike Haydon and Joe Ireland later joined indie band The Middle East which featured two tracks in Triple J's hottest 100 in 2010. Dave Powys also went on to join indie folk band The Paper Kites.
"On 31 March 2014 it was announced on the band's fan-run Facebook page that they were reforming for a once off show on 11 May 2014 as a benefit for Fist2face record store. The show was held at Ding Dong Lounge and featured supports from Antiskeptic, The Ramshackle Army, Best Before, Payoff and more. The show sold out."
= = = Full Scale (band) = = =
"Full Scale (formerly known as Full Scale Deflection, later known as Full Scale Revolution) is an Australian alternative metal band that formed in Perth, Western Australia during 1998. The band relocated to Melbourne in 2001."
"Full Scale released two extended plays; ""Black Arrows"" and ""White Arrows"" both in 2003 on Popstar Records. They also released a self-titled studio album issued in 2005 on Columbia Records, ""Full Scale""."
"Full Scale were formed in 1998 in Perth as Full Scale Deflection. By 1999, they consisted of Ezekiel the Ox on lead vocals, Nic Frey on drums, Chris Frey on bass guitar, Forrester Savell on synthesiser, and Jimmy Tee on guitar. Matt Crute (aka Crutey) soon replaced Nic Frey on drums. Rob Kaay replaced Chris Frey on bass guitar by 2000. They released the album, ""Symptoms of Chaos"", on 11 November 2000. The band dropped the word Deflection from their name and then moved to Melbourne in 2001. Despite playing their original songs for some of their shows, they developed new music."
"Kaay and Andrew McGuiness (a lawyer) formed a record label, Popstar Records, and Full Scale released their debut extended play, ""Black Arrows"" in March 2003. This was followed by a second EP, ""White Arrows"" in August. There was a brief line-up change; Tee left the band, being replaced by Tristan Ross for about six months. Under the management of Kaay, the band toured the east coast extensively."
"According to Allmusic's reviewer, Johnny Loftus, ""the band's hard-hitting, gristly sound – led by Ox's vocal seethe – caught the interest of American majors"". By the end of the year, Tee rejoined and the band moved to Los Angeles where they were signed to Columbia Records (SonyBMG) and released their self-titled album, ""Full Scale"", on 8 March 2005. After the album's release they toured the United States as the opening act for US rap rock band, Hed PE."
"Upon returning to Australia, Crutey and Tee decided to play one last show with the band and Ben Brennan (Seven, Full Scale Revolution) played his first show with Full Scale on bass guitar at the Corner Hotel in Melbourne on 17 March 2006. Ox moved on to a new group, Mammal."
"In January 2016 Ox and Tee announced that they were reforming the band with a new rhythm section of Chris Webber (Webbsy) and Leigh Miller. They announced February 2016 tour dates in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth."
"The band released a new song entitled ""Jurassic Graveyard"" in January 2018, and embarked on a national tour of Australia. So far, no new album has yet been announced."
"After Full Scale, Ox became the front man for Mammal, from March 2006, they released an EP, ""Mammal"". Their single ""Slaves"" was produced by Ox's ex-bandmate Savell. They later released two albums ("""" and ""The Majority"") and disbanded in 2009. He was the front-man of The Ox & the Fury with Brennan, Lucius Borich and Dom Italiano, as an alternate country music group. Ox also appeared in theatre, and produced music for hip hop groups. Ox later became the front man of Over-Reactor (based in Melbourne), which released their album, ""Lose Your Delusion""."
"Kaay became an author and entrepreneur. He used the business management skills he had acquired to build Full Scale into the band that was signed to Columbia Records to start his own Australian company. Right after Full Scale, he joined Sunk Loto in September 2006, until they broke up in December 2007. After that he worked with the Brown brothers for nearly two years on an unreleased project tentatively entitled, ""The Flood The Flood"". Deciding to retire from the live-music-touring scene in 2008, Kaay released a series of books, ""Robkaay Journals. Vol. I, My Glorious Nightmare"" (2008), based on his recollections of his music career over a period of ten years. Vol. II followed in 2010 as ""This is what it's really like being in a band"". He has also written two fantasy fiction novels, ""Silverbirch: A Tear in the Fabric of the Night Sky""(2009) and Silverbirch: Fall of the Epicenter. His first Silverbirch novel cracked the Top 10 Amazon.com chart in its first week of release in the Science Fiction category. Kaay is now a successful entrepreneur running multiple businesses under his company Kaay.com.au(.)"
"It took Girls Aloud five months to release ""No Good Advice"". Nadine Coyle said in an interview with The Lipster, ""We were No.1 for a month straight and then getting songs from all these other producers and we were, 'Nah, don't like it'. We waited from December to May before releasing a second single because we knew it had to be our strong point or we might as well kiss our careers goodbye."" Kimberley Walsh further exclaimed, ""We knew it was strong enough to come back with."" Girls Aloud reportedly had to re-record ""No Good Advice"" because ""it features rude words"", such as ""damn"" and ""shit"". However, the line ""Here I am / Dirty hands, I don't give a damn"" was kept intact. An explicit version of the song appears on the special edition bonus disc of ""The Sound of Girls Aloud"", replacing the lyric ""shut your mouth because it might show"" with ""shut your mouth because your shit might show"". Furthermore, an early demo of the song appears on a singles boxset released in 2009; this demo including the clean lyric in the first bridge and the explicit lyric in the second bridge."
"The song was released as a CD single, featuring an exclusive b-side entitled ""On a Round"", which was later covered by Taiwanese singer Jolin Tsai under the title ""Run Run"" for her 2009 compilation album ""Jeneration"". The CD format also includes the Dreadzone Vocal Mix of ""No Good Advice"" and its music video. The DVD single did not actually feature the ""No Good Advice"" music video, just a photo gallery and behind-the-scenes footage. It did, however, include audio of the track and the video to ""Sound of the Underground"". Another remix, the Doublefunk Vocal Mix, was later featured on the ""Life Got Cold"" single and the remix album ""Mixed Up""."
"""No Good Advice"" received mostly positive reviews from music critics. A BBC review described the song as ""better than anything else [...] in the charts."" Unlike many other songs, it was said to be ""not obsessed with trying to be a cutting-edge club hit, [...] with at least three different killer hooks welded together"" that borrowed heavily from the 1980s. It was said to be ""just as good, if not better"" than ""Sound of the Underground"". It provides ""more brassy and in-your-face lyrics of defiance and determination [...] Higgins injects an element of instant-catchy-cool to the songs without going overboard in trying to shape uber-chic dance floor hits."" On a less positive side, Tourdates.co.uk said that ""No Good Advice"" was a failure at adding attitude to Girls Aloud's music and imitates ""as many songs as possible."" The song has been compared to The Knack's ""My Sharona""."
"In 2003, the song won the Popjustice £20 Music Prize, an annual prize awarded by a panel of judges organised by music website Popjustice to the singer(s) of the best British pop single of the past year. Popjustice founder Peter Robinson wrote that the song ""established a motif that would saturate Girls Aloud's string of subsequent singles: an unpredictable and triumphantly contrary desire to push and pull the band in exciting new directions at every turn."""
"""No Good Advice"" debuted at number two on the UK Singles Chart, held off by R. Kelly's ""Ignition Remix"". The song slipped to number five in its second week on the chart. The single lasted two more weeks in the top twenty at numbers eleven and seventeen respectively. Overall, ""No Good Advice"" was inside the top forty for six weeks; it spent an additional eight weeks in the top 75, selling over 105,000 copies. ""No Good Advice"" suffered a similar fate on the Irish Singles Chart, peaking at number two behind Ireland's Eurovision finalist Mickey Joe Harte. It spent three consecutive weeks at number three, behind Harte and R. Kelly. The song fell to number seven in its fourth week on the Irish chart. It spent four further weeks in the top twenty."
"The song also charted in the top fifty in Belgium and the Netherlands, placing at numbers 45 and 26 respectively."
"The video for ""No Good Advice"" was directed by Phil Griffin, who previously directed ""Sound of the Underground"" and would also direct ""Life Got Cold"". It features the members of Girls Aloud clad in metallic, silver, futuristic outfits (which are seen on the cover of the original release of their album Sound of the Underground). Girls Aloud fade in and out like holograms, centered around a rusty old car parked near a phone booth. They are joined by several men playing electric guitar, whom they flirt with while in various other poses. In a separate scene, while a black background with bright pinkish lights being emitted from behind, all five girls shake tambourines and dance. The last two scenes are intertwined with neon-coloured animated special effects the background, finally ending with an explosion scene."
"In a special programme shown exclusively on MTV to promote their second album ""What Will the Neighbours Say?"", Girls Aloud confessed that they hated the ""No Good Advice"" video shoot. According to the group, both Cheryl and Sarah's trousers ripped and the make-up artist shouted at them. The group woke with bruised thighs the following day. The music video can be found on the group's 2005 DVD release ""Girls on Film"". In the group's 2007 DVD ""Style"", which also features the music video, Girls Aloud were horrified by the video upon watching it again. Regardless, viewers of FHM TV voted the video for ""No Good Advice"" as the fifth sexiest music video of all time in 2006."
"""No Good Advice"" was performed live for the first time on """" on 5 April 2003, a month ahead of the single's release. Girls Aloud sang in front of a checkered background in red outfits with black accents, as seen on the single's artwork. The group returned to the show three more times to perform ""No Good Advice"", including a performance using taxi cabs as a prop and another using phone booths. It was performed on ""Top of the Pops Saturday"" twice, as well as its parent show. Girls Aloud also visited ""Blue Peter"" and ""Popworld"". It was also performed at a number of live events in 2003, such as Spring Break, Pepsi Silver Clef, Party in the Park, the West Belfast Festival, and a festival in Belgium. Girls Aloud also sang the song on Germany's ""VIVA Interaktiv"". In the United Kingdom, Girls Aloud later performed at the Children in Need telethon and on ""Popworld""'s Christmas special."
"Girls Aloud performed ""No Good Advice"" on their first three concert tours. For their first tour, 2005's What Will the Neighbours Say? Live, Girls Aloud performed the song in school uniforms. The rendition featured an introlude taken from part two of the Pink Floyd song ""Another Brick in the Wall"". The following year, ""No Good Advice"" was featured as the second track on the Chemistry Tour. The group, who were created by mad scientists in the show's opening sequence, wore lab coats. The performance, influenced by Broadway, was set in a laboratory as each member was paired with a male dance partner. After a dance break, the mad scientist dancers performed a ""magic trick"" in which he made Cheryl Cole ""disappear"" and then reappear. For 2007's """", Girls Aloud performed ""No Good Advice"" in lingerie. The stage featured pedestals and platforms which Girls Aloud were on. For 2009's Out of Control Tour, ""No Good Advice"" was included in a greatest hits medley which closed the show. The song was also performed on the band's 2013 reunion tour, Ten - The Hits Tour 2013. It was performed as the second song in the show after the opener ""Sound of the Underground""."

"The album celebrates some of the world's major water bodies and surrounding areas. Although presented as a proper album, it contains tracks from throughout the early career of the band, and was designed as a sort of ""best of"" collection. Compared to ""Mystic Island"", this album's tracks mostly come from the albums ""Cusco II"", ""Virgin Islands"" and ""Ring der Delphine"", but has selected tracks from other albums as well, as well as the brand new track ""Chorus"", an alternate version of ""Flying Condor"" from the ""Apurimac"" album. Each track has been remastered for this release. Additionally, some of the tracks have been edited to shorten them, most noticeably ""Bur Said"", ""Jebel at Tarik"", and ""Bodensee""."

"David Michael Brown (born February 25, 1970 in Summit, New Jersey) is a former professional American football quarterback who played for Duke University and later in the National Football League for the New York Giants and Arizona Cardinals."
"Brown grew up in Westfield, New Jersey and played high school football at Westfield High School, graduating in 1988."
"After his career in football, Dave went on to become a director at New York Life Investment Management. In 2008, Dave joined Lehman Brothers where he served as a Senior Vice President of Lehman's Private Fund Marketing Group. He left Lehman Brothers in 2008 to become the Co-Head of Greenhill's Private Capital Advisory Group. In 2015, he joined Moelis & Company to lead their new private equity fundraising business."
"Brown had a successful career at Duke University. In his November 4, 1989, starting debut he threw for 444 yards against Wake Forest University, including a 97-yard touchdown to wide receiver Clarkston Hines to establish Duke's longest play from scrimmage. Later that month, Brown set a school single-game record with 479 passing yards against the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, upending Duke's rival, 41-0, to finish the year with seven straight wins and a share of the Atlantic Coast Conference championship. The Blue Devils subsequently received a bid to play in the All-American Bowl, Duke's first bowl game in almost 30 years. In 1991, Brown was chosen as the recipient of Duke's Carmen Falcone Team MVP Award."
"Brown ranks in the top ten in the following categories for Duke football quarterbacks: pass attempts in a season (#4, 437), pass attempts in a career (#5, 845), pass attempts in a game (#8, 54), pass completions in a game (#5, 33), pass completions in a season (#5, 230), pass completions in a career (#5, 463), passing yards in a game (#1, 479), passing yards in a season (#5, 2,794), passing yards in a career (#5, 5,717), touchdown passes in a game (#2, 4), touchdown passes in a season (#3, 20), touchdown passes in a career (#4, 42), 300-yard passing games in a season (#2, 4), 400-yard passing games in a career (#3, 8), 400-yard passing games in a season (#1, 2), and 400-yard passing games in a career (#2, 2)."
"Brown ranks in the top ten in the following categories for Duke football offensive players: total offensive yards in a season (#5, 2,851), total offensive yards in a career(#5, 5,770), total offensive yards in a game (#2, 470), and two-point attempts in a game (#1, 3)."
"Brown was drafted by the Giants as the top overall selection in the 1992 Supplemental Draft. His first start came on December 12, 1992, when he was forced into the lineup due to injuries of Phil Simms, Jeff Hostetler, and Kent Graham, dropping a 19–0 decision to the Phoenix Cardinals. To make matters worse, Brown himself was injured during the game and didn't play a down the rest of the season."
"Following Simms' retirement after the following season, Brown won the starting job in 1994 and helped guide his team to a 9–7 record, including a season-ending six-game winning streak. However, the Giants won only a combined 11 games in the next two seasons and their offense finished statistically worst in the league in 1996. This finish led to the firing of Dan Reeves, and the hiring of noted QB guru Jim Fassel."
"After injuring his chest during a game against the Dallas Cowboys, Brown lost his starting job in 1997 and was never able to re-claim it. Jim Fassel went the rest of the season with Danny Kanell at quarterback and had an unexpected run to the playoffs and division title. In the off-season Brown was signed by the Arizona Cardinals to play primarily as a backup, and he ended up finishing his career in 2001 with Arizona."
"Following his career in professional football, Brown moved on to investment management."

"Tyrolit is an Austrian company that develops, manufactures and markets abrasive products as well as concrete sawing and drilling equipment. With 26 production locations on 5 continents, the TYROLIT group belongs to the world’s largest producers of bonded abrasives. The company is based in Schwaz, Tyrol, Austria. TYROLIT, a registered trademark, was named after the mineral Tyrolite, first described in 1845 in Tyrol."
"Tyrolit was co-founded on the 13th of February 1919 by Daniel Swarovski to manufacture grinding wheels for the production of Swarovski-Crystals. During World War I, the Swarovski Group was cut off from supplies of grinding wheels and was forced to develop and produce its own grinding wheels. After the war, it was decided to commercialize this activity and to start a separate company: Tyrolit was born."
"In 1950, the company relocated from the Swarovski Headquarters in Wattens to a new location in Schwaz. One of the largest drivers of growth of the company was the market launch of the glass fibre reinforced cut-off and grinding wheel SECUR in 1952. The glass fibre reinforcement greatly improved the security of the tools against centrifugal breakage."
In 1991 Tyrolit acquired the US company Diamond Products and the Swiss company Hydrostress. These acquisitions added significant presence in the market for concrete drilling and sawing systems.
"Further major acquisitions took place in 2004 with the purchasing of the Czech company Carborundum Electrite, in 2009 with the purchasing of the US company Radiac and in 2014 with the purchasing of the South African company Grinding Techniques."
The Tyrolit Group is organized in four divisions:
The Tyrolit Group operates under the following brands:

A reboot of the 1982 film of the same name and the fourth installment overall in the ""Poltergeist"" franchise, the film stars Sam Rockwell, Rosemarie DeWitt, Jared Harris and Jane Adams."
"Produced by Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert's Ghost House Pictures, Real World Pictures and Roy Lee's Vertigo Entertainment, the film was released on May 22, 2015 by 20th Century Fox and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in the United States.

"Eric and Amy Bowen are a married couple looking to buy a house for themselves and their three children: 16-year-old daughter Kendra (Saxon Sharbino), 9-year-old son Griffin (Kyle Catlett), and 6-year-old daughter Madison (Kennedi Clements). Eric was recently laid off, but they are shown a house that has recently come on the market that fits their price range, so they purchase it and move in."
"The first night, they hear strange noises in the walls and Griffin finds a box containing clown dolls that were left at the house. In the middle of the night, lights and electronic devices start turning on and off, as some unseen force appears to move through the home. The commotion wakes Griffin, and he goes downstairs and finds Maddie talking to an unknown presence inside the television. She tells Griffin someone is coming, and he attempts to unplug the TV, causing the lights to go out of control. Maddie then tells the family: ""They're here"" while touching their TV screen."
"The following evening, Eric and Amy go to dinner with their friends, leaving the three children at home. They learn that their house was built on an old cemetery, although the property developer was supposed to have relocated the human remains. Kendra wakes up to a strange sound in the laundry room. While investigating the noise, the floor cracks and a corpse's hand emerges. It begins pulling at her foot, but she manages to pull herself up. Meanwhile, Griffin notices the clown dolls seem to be moving by themselves. One clown doll attacks him, but he destroys it and runs from his bedroom. He finds Maddie in her room, scared, crouching in a corner, and tells her to stay while he goes to find Kendra. Maddie is then lured into her closet and becomes lost in an unending void. As she sees her bedroom drifting away further, she is dragged into the darkness by ghosts. Griffin is grabbed through a window by the branches of the old tree outside their house, which pulls him outside. Amy and Eric arrive home to see Griffin being tossed around in the tree branches, which releases its grip when they come close, while Kendra tells them she can't find Maddie."
"The family hears Maddie's voice emanating from the television. Amy places her hand on the television screen while Maddie's static hand is seen to be touching Amy's hand from the other side of the screen. Amy and Griffin visit the Paranormal Research department for help. The staff set up equipment in the house and install GPS devices on everyone in the house. While trying to contact Maddie, Eric is ambushed in the closet by a ghost resembling her. Angered, he breaks down the closet wall, throwing a chair into the darkness inside the closet; the chair falls back into the living room of the house, revealing a possible portal Maddie can escape through. The investigators realize that the haunting is a poltergeist. The lead investigator, Dr. Brooke Powell, decides to call occult specialist and television personality Carrigan Burke (revealed, much later, to be Powell's ex)."
"Carrigan explains that Maddie is a possible psychic, able to communicate with spirits. He reveals that the ghosts are trapped and are angry because only the headstones were moved to the new cemetery, but the bodies remain; they plan on using Maddie ""to free them from their purgatory"". Carrigan comes up with a plan to get Maddie back. He anchors a rope in Maddie's room and tosses it into the vortex. They attempt to use Griffin's toy drone to guide Maddie out, but it is immediately destroyed by the ghosts when inside the portal. Griffin, guilt-ridden over leaving Maddie alone in the first place, goes through the portal himself. When he finds Maddie, the ghosts attempt to destroy the rope to trap them, but Griffin and Maddie grab onto the rope and are brought back through the portal."
"The family get in their car and begin to leave the house, but the ghosts drag them back into the house and attempt to abduct Maddie again. The family saves her from being sucked into the portal, and Carrigan decides that as the only other psychic, he must go into the vortex and lead the spirits into the light. The Bowens flee as the house is destroyed by the spirits soaring into the sky as a beacon of light. The investigative team run to their equipment, looking for a sign that Carrigan managed to get back."
"As the Bowens look for a new house, the realtor shows them a house with lots of closet space and an old tree in the backyard; the Bowens drive away laughing. During the end credits, it's revealed that Carrigan survived the incident and is back filming his ghost program, now hosting the show with Dr. Powell."
"In early September 2013, the crew shot interior scenes for the film in an old residence in Toronto. Exterior shots were filmed on the West Mountain of Hamilton. Principal photography began on September 23 and ended on December 13, 2013."
"On August 6, 2014, the film's release date was shifted from February 13, 2015 to July 24, 2015. On March 4, 2015, the date was shifted again to when it was previously set for ""Spy"". It was released in 3D."
"The film's first trailer was released on February 5, 2015. Forrest Wickman of ""Slate Magazine""'s opinion was that the trailer made the film appear to be too similar to the original film. James Hibberd of ""Entertainment Weekly"" said that the trailer ""retains and amplifies several elements from the original"", and praised that ""the modernizing doesn’t result in, say, the family’s daughter being kidnapped by ghosts in Snapchat"". Brad Miska of Bloody Disgusting stated that ""while every fiber of my being wants to reject it, [the film] actually looks pretty insane"", and praised the trailer's final shot. Ben Kuchera of ""Polygon"" also opined that the trailer appeared to be similar to the original film, but that it ""looks great, as a horror movie""."
"""Poltergeist"" was released on DVD Blu-ray Disc and Blu-ray 3D on September 29, 2015. The Blu-ray editions included an extended cut of the film."
"On April 10, 2019, it was announced that the Russo brothers would helm a new remake of the franchise."
"On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 31% based on 129 reviews and an average rating of 4.8/10. The site's consensus reads: ""Paying competent homage without adding anything of real value to the original ""Poltergeist"", this remake proves just as ephemeral (but half as haunting) as its titular spirit."" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 47 out of 100 based on 27 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""C+"" on an A+ to F scale."
"Writing for ""Variety"", Andrew Barker called it ""generally entertaining yet fundamentally unnecessary"" and concluded: ""Even when one is inclined to admire the cleverness with which the remake revisits and reincorporates ""Poltergeist""s themes, it’s hard to pinpoint a single moment where it improves on them, and the aura of inessentiality hangs thick over the proceedings"". Neil Genzlinger gave the film a mostly positive review in ""The New York Times"", writing: ""The new ""Poltergeist"" might well be the scariest movie 13-or-unders have yet seen, just as the original was for their parents back in 1982. Those parents might find it an enjoyable trip down memory lane, even if they do now recognize it as largely a well-served collection of horror-movie tropes"". Eddie Goldberger echoed that sentiment in The New York Daily News, writing ""It doesn't approach the original--really, how could it? But the new ""Poltergeist"" is a fun, worthy horror entry."" Tirdad Derakhshani wrote in ""The Philadelphia Inquirer"": ""It's not exactly a scary film, but it does provide an enjoyable ride. It's good fun. But it left me befuddled"", adding: ""Why would anyone want to remake ""Poltergeist"" in the first place?"". Writing in ""The Daily Telegraph"", Mike McCahill called the film ""an efficient scare-machine"". Bilge Ebiri wrote in ""New York"" magazine: ""This new ""Poltergeist"" isn't anything special... But it's not a travesty, and that feels like cause for brief celebration""."
"Other critics took a more skeptical view of the film. Writing a review for ""The Village Voice"", Alan Scherstuhl stated, """"Poltergeist 2015"" is to ""Poltergeist '82"" what today's shipped-frozen-to-the-store Pizza Hut dough is to the kneaded-on-site pies the chain's stoned cooks tossed in the Reagan era. It's the same kind of thing, with the same shape and some shared ingredients, but the texture's gone limp, and there's no sense of occasion about it, and there's some unpalatable goop stuffed in the crust. In a pinch, it beats pizzalessness — but just barely."" Linda Cook wrote in ""The Quad City Times"", ""The ""Poltergeist"" remake is OK, but won't stay with you."" Randy Cordova in ""The Arizona Republic"" wrote, ""Ultimately, the whole affair is forgettable."""
"""Poltergeist"" grossed $47.4 million in North America and $48.2 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $95.6 million against a budget of an estimated $35 million."
"In North America, ""Poltergeist"" made $1.4 million during its Thursday night showings from 2,500 theaters, and an estimated $9.4 million on its opening day. Through its first three-day opening, it grossed $22.6 million from 3,240 theaters, debuting at fourth place at the box office behind ""Tomorrowland"", ""Pitch Perfect 2"" and """".

"Bayamón could not run with Arecibo and Flor Melendez knew that he could control the tempo of the game in the first two games of this final series. Both were very close games. Despite these woes, the Vaquero fans hoped Bayamon would come back. This was dispelled as soon as Richard Lugo was able to play for the Captains in game three."
"After the Cowboys rallied to win game four and force a fifth game, the Captains closed out the series in game five. Larry Ayuso scored 40 points on offense and played defense well in that closing game."

"The reconquest of the National Superior Basketball League Championship is a fact. The Arecibo Capitanes are the new Champions of the BSN.

Incidentally, the Capitanes became the first team in the history of the BSN, to win a seventh and deciding game as the visiting team. The final score of the game it was 73 - 62. The match had to be stopped and subsequently confiscated, because the team's fans of Bayamón, began throwing objects onto the court and the game could not be terminated. We the game was stopped, there was still 1:42 on the clock, but Arecibo had absolute control of the game. It is noteworthy that this is the second Championship won by the Capitanes in the past three tournaments of the BSN."
"At the beginning of the meeting the atmosphere was worthy of a seventh game. Donta smith immediately began the annotations for Bayamón, but Larry Ayuso did not remain with folded arms. In the first five minutes of action, Ayuso had already made three triples. Then, when the clock struck 4:48, Danilo Pinncok managed a basket that gave them the first lead in the game 13 - 12. After this move Bayamón managed to take advantage on the board 19 - 17. All this so that in the next moves, Guillermo Díaz scoring three free throws and Danny Santiago make a dunk that brought the Capitanes to dominate the first quarter 22 - 19."
"The start of the second period for Arecibo was very explosive. The Capitanes opened with a push of 7-0, thanks to a triple by Larry Ayuso and two consecutive baskets by Danilo Pinnock. At that time, Arecibo took off on the scoreboard 29 - 19. Incidentally, those were the first points of a rally that did Danilo Pinnock. He scored eight consecutive points for Arecibo.

David Cortés managed a shot and Danny Santiago make another. In this way Arecibo was leading 72 - 60, while still detracted 3:45 left in the game. Bayamón managed to score three extra points, before they culminate the event. This was so because on the last play of the game, Danny Santiago achieved an impressive steal. After the steal, Andrés Rodríguez gets the ball and he received a hard foul that led him to the free throw line. Before Andrés Rodríguez could make his attempts, the fans from Bayamón began a relentless rain of objects and this forced the League officials to confiscate the game in Arecibo's favor.

"For the second time during the Final Series, the Captains came out strong in the offensive side of the court. Consecutive triples Larry Ayuso and David Cortes took off immediately to Arecibo on the scoreboard. To make matters worse, Danilo Pinnock prescribed another triple and this allowed Arecibo took off 13 by 6. Quebradillas did not remain with arms folded and responded with two straight triples David Huertas. These triples came to the Pirates 13 by 12.

"Capitanes de Arecibo win 2 straight Championships (2010, 2011) and their fourth championship in 7 years."
"The PBL began its third season in 2010 with nine teams. The Capitanes were one of three expansion teams. For PBL play, the Capitanes take the name of Puerto Rico rather than their home city. The Capitanes established two different talent pools. As well as the original BSN team, they had a roster for PBL play that included selections in that league's player draft. Their subsequent first signings were Andrés Rodríguez and Bonzi Wells. Other international players signed by the Capitanes during the off-season were Elías Larry Ayuso, Angelo Reyes and Walter Hodge. Antonio Látimer and José Rosario completed the signings, while Hodge left during the season to join the Cangrejeros. Their performance earned the team constant inclusion in MLN Sports' basketball rankings, debuting in the fourth spot. During the undefeated streak, David Rosario was named PBL Coach of the Month for January."
"The team won its first series against the Maryland GreenHawks, with scores of 109:100 and 99:91. The Capitanes subsequently won their first contests against the Manchester Millrats (116:104) and Vermont Frost Heaves (114:103), establishing a lead in the league's standings. The Capitanes' next game was against the team that held the second place in the standing, the Lawton-Fort Sill Cavalry (3-0), winning with scores of 101:94. The team won its first contests against the Buffalo Stampede (114:89), Halifax Rainmen (108:101) and Quebec Kebs (93:86). After two weeks of inactivity, the Capitanes began a series of away games defeating the GreenHawks 111:93. On March 21, 2010 the game between the Rainmen from Halifax and the Capitanes was played after the game had been canceled due to bad weather the previous time it had been scheduled. The score was 106:94, Capitanes."
"In March 2010, the PBL announced that it was forced to expel the franchise due to an alleged failure to adhere to its rules & guidelines. Among the violations cited were, failing to appear at road games, failure to pay amount owed to the league, and lack of communication with league officers. At the moment, the team held the second best record in the league and had secured a spot in the playoffs."
"The Capitanes responded by hiring one of Puerto Rico's top litigation attorneys, Lee Sepulvado of the law firm Sepulvado & Maldonado. The team's lawyers filed a complaint seeking a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction before federal court in Puerto Rico. The PBL hired O'Neill & Borges, one of Puerto Rico's top law firms and was represented by attorney Salvador Antonetti Stutts whom attended Harvard Law School and is a former Solicitor General of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico."
After the attorneys conducted oral arguments before Federal Judge Juan Perez Gimenez the court entered a temporary restraining order against the PBL instructing the league to immediately reinstate the Capitanes and allow them to participate in the 2010 playoffs. Shortly thereafter the PBL agreed to the issuance of a preliminary injunction order formally reinstating the team.
The matter received extensive media coverage and the PBL was forced to accept its wrongdoing by setting aside the expulsion of the team. The Capitanes vehemently denied the charges and all along insisted their only goal was to win in the basketball court and not the legal court.
"As runners-up of the 2007 BSN season, the Capitanes were selected to represent Puerto Rico in the first edition of the FIBA Americas League, along with the BSN-champion Santurce Crabbers. Before the competition began, the Capitanes' coach, David Rosario, stated that the team's preparation was intense so that they would be able to adapt in order to match the advantage expected to be presented by Fuerza Regia and Halcones Xalapa, since the tournament occurred in the middle of the ""Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional"" season."

"Highwire artist Nik Wallenda had been planning to walk across the canyon since 2008, but put the plan on hold first due to logistical difficulties and then to highwire walk over Niagara Falls in 2012. After his success at Niagara, he accelerated plans to cross the canyon. In March 2013, Wallenda and Discovery came to terms on television rights for the walk."
"To prepare, Wallenda practiced in his home town of Sarasota, Florida in heavy winds, including during Tropical Storm Andrea. On June 23, he successfully completed the walk without safety devices in approximately 23 minutes, making him the first person to tightrope walk across a Grand Canyon area gorge. At , it was the highest walk of his career. Afterwards, Wallenda said it was more difficult than he had expected."
"""Skywire Live"" aired live in over 200 countries worldwide. It was a ratings success in the United States, generating Discovery's highest-ever rating for a live broadcast. The show also generated a lot of interest of social media, with Wallenda's public display of his Christian faith being a focal point."
"Nik Wallenda is American highwire artist and member of the famed Flying Wallendas circus family. He has been walking the wire since age two and now holds seven world records. In 2008, he set the record for highest and longest bicycle ride across a tightrope. In 2012, he became the first person to successfully tightrope walk directly over Niagara Falls. The feat aired live on ABC who, much to the dismay of Wallenda, decided at the last minute that he would have to wear a safety harness for the event."
"The Grand Canyon area has played host to a number of high-profile stunts and daredevil feats. In 1922, Royal Thomas flew a Lincoln Stanard biplane into Grand Canyon National Park, landing just from the Canyon's edge. The park did not yet have stunting regulations and the feat was approved by park superintendent Walter Crosby. In 1980, stuntman Dar Robinson drove a sportscar over the canyon's edge, parachuting out of the car as it fell. He did the stunt in Hualapai Indian Reservation after being denied a permit by the National Park. In 1999, daredevil Robbie Knievel jumped a narrow portion of canyon in Hualapai territory on a motorcycle, breaking his own world record for longest jump in the process. The event aired live on Fox News. In 2006, Bob Burnquist skateboarded off a ramp into the canyon, descending to the bottom with a parachute. In 2011, Yves ""Jetman"" Rossy used a custom made jet suit to glide above the Hualapai reservation for eight minutes. He covered a distance of before parachuting into the canyon."
"Nik Wallenda originally secured permits to walk across ""the Grand Canyon"" in 2008, and planned to make the trip as early as 2009. However, the walk was delayed due to substantial logistical hurdles. His agent, Winston Simone, commented ""There's no electricity [at the planned location], there's no hotels, and for the last half-hour there are no paved roads."" Additionally, at a then-estimated distance of , the feat would be the longest walk of Wallenda's career by a significant margin. When the opportunity to cross Niagara Falls arose, the Grand Canyon walk was put on hold. Shortly after crossing Niagara Falls, Wallenda said he would try to make the Grand Canyon crossing ""within a year"". In August 2012, he said that he was ""98 percent"" certain that the walk would take place in May or June 2013 and announced he would get ""something in writing"" that no safety harness would be required for the walk."
"On March 18, 2013, Wallenda announced that he had come to terms with The Discovery Channel for television rights. ABC also bid for the walk, but was concerned about the show being repetitive with the Niagara walk and was not prepared to pay as much as Discovery. Additionally, Discovery emphasized its international footprint and promised Wallenda that he would not have to wear a safety device. After he came to terms with Discovery, both Wallenda and his network partners had to finalize permits with the Navajo. According to a tribal spokesperson, the decision to allow the walk was not taken lightly. The process included archaeological, biological, and environmental impact studies."
"According to Wallenda, ""There's a lot of updrafts and downdrafts, and the winds are hard to predict [in the Canyon]"". The air temperature during the walk was expected to exceed , with the steel cable hitting . To prepare, Wallenda walked a wire twice daily along the banks of a Sarasota river with fans watching. He practiced with wind machines to simulate wind gusts up to . During Tropical Storm Andrea he practiced among wind gusts and heavy rain. Wallenda said it was ""hard to prepare for [the updrafts] ... when it comes down to Mother Nature, we’re not in control."" His highwire shoes, which are custom made by his mother, had elk-skin bottoms to counteract the heat."
"On June 19, Discovery aired a special episode of ""MythBusters"" titled ""Duct Tape Canyon"" to coincide with Wallenda's walk. On the episode, Wallenda appears to the show's team as a hallucination as they attempt to survive in the desert using only duct tape."
"On June 23, 2013, Wallenda highwire walked across the Little Colorado River Gorge in the Navajo Tribal Park. The location was outside Grand Canyon National Park's borders, about 40 miles east of the main tourist facilities. In its official press release, Discovery previewed the feat ""Nik Wallenda ... will traverse the majestic Grand Canyon"". Other interpretations of whether or not the location was part of the Grand Canyon varied. The Reuters news agency described the location as simply ""the Grand Canyon"", while the Associated Press described it as a ""gorge near the Grand Canyon."" Commentary by ""Forbes"" writer Andrew Bender said there was ""one problem"" with the walk – ""It [wasn't] at the Grand Canyon"". He did, however, say the risks were as real and the visuals as spectacular at the location. ""National Geographic"" described the location as ""the Grand Canyon"" but noted that, like previous ""Grand Canyon"" stunts, it was taking place outside the park's borders."
"According to the United States Geological Survey, the Grand Canyon geological area includes the Little Colorado River Gorge. A Grand Canyon National Park spokesperson said the walk ""would not have been approved"" to take place in the Park due to regulations that ""events must not unreasonably impair the park’s atmosphere of peace and tranquility or have an unacceptable impact on the experience of park visitors."""
"The event, entitled ""Skywire Live"", aired live on the Discovery Channel in 219 countries with a 10-second delay. Coverage began with an hour-and-ten-minute preshow, followed by an hour-and-ten-minute main event. It was produced by Peacock Productions and hosted by Natalie Morales and Willie Geist. During the event, viewers were able to select from five different camera angles online at SkywireLive.com, including one attached to his chest that faced straight down. Another camera attached to Wallenda faced straight ahead, and a film crew filmed from the bottom of the Canyon."
"Before the walk started, Wallenda and his family prayed with evangelist and family friend Joel Osteen. He was then helicoptered to an island in the middle of the canyon to start his journey. To limit environmental impact, the event was not open to the public. Members of the press were required to sign a waiver saying they would not sue for post-traumatic stress disorder in the event that Wallenda fell. An armed security guard was positioned at the bottom of the canyon to protect his body from animals."
"As the walk began at 7:38pm MDT, Wallenda realized the wire had become slippery due to gathered dust. He spat on his hands and rubbed his shoes for better grip. Shortly thereafter, he stopped and crouched down on the wire due to wind gusts. He later stopped a second time to break the bounce of the wire that his walking had induced. Throughout the walk, Wallenda could be heard praying, repeatedly saying ""Help me to relax, Lord"", ""God, you’re so good. Thank you for this opportunity, Lord"", and ""Thank you, Jesus."" Midway through he said ""Thank you Lord. Thank you for calming that cable, God"". Wallenda ran the last few steps then jumped off and kissed the ground. Completing the walk in 22 minutes, 54 seconds, Wallenda became the first person to highwire walk across a Grand Canyon area gorge."
"At , the walk was the highest of Wallenda's career, about seven times as high as the Niagara crossing. He covered a distance of approximately in 22 minutes, 54 seconds, using wire. He carried a balancing pole weighing . Wallenda said it was important for him to vary his pace throughout the walk to prevent resonance effects. Terry and Mike Troffer were his safety coordinator and chief engineer, respectively, for the event."
"Commenting on the walk, a Navajo spokesman said, ""We are honored to be a part of this historic event and showcase the beauty that exists on Navajo country,"" and said he expected the event to boost tourism. Tribal president Ben Shelly said he was grateful for the publicity. ""It’s exposing what a beautiful land we have"", he said. ""Another nation exists, and it's the Navajo Nation."" However, a group of Navajo and other Native Americans protested the event saying the tribe should not be promoting the risking of human life to promote tourism. The Navajos did not charge for the use of the site, but Discovery did pay for the paving of a new road and parking lot to accommodate spectators."
"After the walk, Wallenda said it was more difficult than he had expected and that ""it took every bit of me to stay focused"". He said that dust had accumulated in his contact lenses and called the walk unusually stressful. Additionally, he said an ""optical illusion"" made it hard to concentrate. However, he called the view breathtaking, and said the opportunity ""was a dream come true."""
"""Skywire Live With Nik Wallenda"" drew an average of 10.7 million viewers in the United States, making it the highest rated program of the night. It beat out NBC's ""Crossing Lines"" (4.4 million viewers) and CBS's ""60 Minutes"" (8.2 million) among other offerings. Viewership increased steadily throughout the program, with a spike as the walk itself began."
"During the walk, 13 million people were tuned in. Those numbers made ""Skywire Live"" the highest rated live program in Discovery's history, easily beating the 4.21 million people who watched Felix Baumgartner's skydive in October 2012, and third-highest overall. The 4.77 share during the actual walk was also the highest in company history. Pre-coverage of the walk also pulled in high numbers, attracting 6.25 million viewers. ""Naked and Afraid"" which debuted after ""Skywire"" attracted 4.16 million viewers. Overall, Discovery had its fourth highest-ranked night ever."
"Online coverage attracted 2.1 million viewers, and tweets hit 40,000 per minute. During the peak hour, the program had 648,000 mentions on Twitter.

"To capitalize on the program's success, Discovery aired a follow-up interview, ""Skywire: Nik Talks the Walk"", on June 30. In the special, Wallenda provided commentary on his walk as the entire 23 minute feat was replayed."
"Commentary by Sally Jenkins published by the ""Washington Post"" called Wallenda ""The ultimate athlete, free of all law except gravity ... Beyond criticism. Committing a pointless act — yet praying."" Jenkins remarked ""We thought daredevils were gone — too much science had reduced them to the predictable ... But along has come this new breed."" Comparing Wallenda and Baumgartner's record skydive that also aired on Discovery, she speculated that the emergence of online media combined with ""stale, stupid predictability"" of television shows has led the re-emergence of interest in daredevil activity. She concluded ""Wallenda’s meaningless act restored the meaning of real."" ""The Telegraph""'s Ben Fogle declared ""I have never felt such fear for another person ... I have a new superhero: not a superman with a cape, but a slightly tubby dad in jeans and a T-shirt."""
"On social media, Wallenda's prominent display of his faith was the most popular topic. Conservative talk show host Dana Loesch tweeted ""Evangelism via entertainment on a tightrope and a major cable network. Brilliant."" In contrast comedian and noted atheist Ricky Gervais poked fun saying ""Well done Jesus for getting that bloke across the Grand Canyon safely. I bet he feels silly for wasting so much time practicing now."" Actor Dean Norris remarked ""Regardless of religious belief or not,feel little happier bout life then had #wallenda kept saying thank you nihilists, life is meaningless."" Interviewing Joel Osteen after Wallenda's walk, Piers Morgan called the event ""an advertisement for the power of prayer and Christianity in America""."
"Blue jeans manufacture Buffalo David Bitton was surprised that Wallenda wore a pair of their jeans for the walk. To celebrate, they erected a billboard showing a picture of the walk and reading ""Dear Nik, Thanks for taking us to new heights. Buffalo David Bitton."" The company also offered Wallenda and his immediate family free jeans for the rest of their lives."
