"And I said when we went in, I went in to show Mark now, but I said I can, you can do it myself."

I don't.
"So you shouldn't, you shouldn't"
But I think the music's good.
"Don't, don't put that on very loud, I've got a bit of a headache."
You'll have a lot of headache by the time I've finished.
What?
We're gonna burn all these?
This is rubbish.
These want burning don't they?
Do they?
Yeah.
I'll burn them.
Wh why do they want burning?
Well I don't like things like this flying around.
The old pay slips and things.
So I I'll burn them.
I'll burn all this.
Where will we burn them?
I'll burn them in the garden.
On the top patio.
Have a little fire going.
I wouldn't bother so much John.
"Yeah, I I would."
That rubbish?
Rubbish.

Rubbish.

We'll keep the coins.
What did you say?
I'll keep the coins.
"John said ` how ripping , ' but decided to have tea first ."
"He asked if there were many pirates on the island just now , and Peter said he had never known so many ."
` Who is captain now ? '
"` Hook , ' answered Peter ; and his face became very stern as he said that hated word ."
` Jas .
Hook ? '
` Ay . '
"Then indeed Michael began to cry , and even John could speak in gulps only , for they knew Hook 's reputation ."
"` He was Blackbeard 's bo ` sun , ' John whispered huskily ."
` He is the worst of them all .
He is the only man of whom Barbecue was afraid . '
"` That 's him , ' said Peter ."
` What is he like ?
Is he big ? '
` He is not so big as he was . '
` How do you mean ? ' '
I cut off a bit of him . '
` You ! '
"` Yes , me , ' said Peter sharply . '"
I was n't meaning to be disrespectful . '
"` Oh , all right ' ` But , I say , what bit ? '"
` His right hand . '
` Then he ca n't fight now ? '
"` Oh , ca n't he just ! '"
` Left-hander ? '
"` He has an iron hook instead of a right hand , and he claws with it . '"
` Claws ! ' '
"I say , John , ' said Peter ."
` Yes . '
"` Say , `` Ay , ay , sir . '' '"
"` Ay , ay , sir . '"
"` There is one thing , ' Peter continued , ` that every boy who serves under me has to promise , and so must you . '"
`` Oh ! ''
"said he , quite loud , and offering his hand ."
`` I see .
You are our new cabin-boy ; pleased I am to see you . ''
And he took my hand in his large firm grasp .
Just then one of the customers at the far side rose suddenly and made for the door .
"It was close by him , and he was out in the street in a moment ."
"But his hurry had attracted my notice , and I recognized him at glance ."
"It was the tallow-faced man , wanting two fingers , who had come first to the Admiral Benbow ."
"`` Oh , '' I cried , `` stop him !"
It 's Black Dog ! ''
"`` I do n't care two coppers who he is , '' cried Silver ."
`` But he has n't paid his score .
"Harry , run and catch him . ''"
One of the others who was nearest the door leaped up and started in pursuit .
"`` If he were Admiral Hawke he shall pay his score , '' cried Silver ; and then , relinquishing my hand , `` Who did you say he was ? ''"
he asked .
`` Black what ? ''
"`` Dog , sir , '' said I. `` Has Mr. Trelawney not told you of the buccaneers ?"
He was one of them . ''
`` So ? ''
cried Silver .
`` In my house !
"Ben , run and help Harry ."
"One of those swabs , was he ?"
"Was that you drinking with him , Morgan ?"
Step up here . ''
"The man whom he called Morgan -- an old , grey-haired , mahogany-faced sailor -- came forward pretty sheepishly , rolling his quid ."
"`` Now , Morgan , '' said Long John very sternly , `` you never clapped your eyes on that Black -- Black Dog before , did you , now ? ''"
"`` Not I , sir , '' said Morgan with a salute ."
"`` You did n't know his name , did you ? ''"
"`` No , sir . ''"
"he cried , shrinking ."
"`` I will turn up the light , '' she said , `` and then you can see for yourself . ''"
"For almost the only time in his life that I know of , Peter was afraid ."
"`` Do n't turn up the light , '' he cried ."
She let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy .
"She was not a little girl heart-broken about him ; she was a grown woman smiling at it all , but they were wet eyed smiles ."
"Then she turned up the light , and Peter saw ."
He gave a cry of pain ; and when the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew back sharply .
`` What is it ? ''
he cried again .
She had to tell him .
"`` I am old , Peter ."
I am ever so much more than twenty .
I grew up long ago . ''
`` You promised not to ! ''
`` I could n't help it .
"I am a married woman , Peter . ''"
"`` No , you 're not . ''"
"`` Yes , and the little girl in the bed is my baby . ''"
"`` No , she 's not . ''"
But he supposed she was ; and he took a step towards the sleeping child with his dagger upraised .
Of course he did not strike .
"He sat down on the floor instead and sobbed ; and Wendy did not know how to comfort him , though she could have done it so easily once ."
"She was only a woman now , and she ran out of the room to try to think ."
"Peter continued to cry , and soon his sobs woke Jane ."
"She sat up in bed , and was interested at once ."
"`` Boy , '' she said , `` why are you crying ? ''"
"Peter rose and bowed to her , and she bowed to him from the bed ."
"`` Hullo , '' he said ."
"`` Hullo , '' said Jane ."
"`` My name is Peter Pan , '' he told her ."
"`` Yes , I know . ''"
"And , by the way I feel , I fancy I 'll be stretched out here another week before I 'll be able to use my pins ."
Who are these Olivers anyhow ?
The old woman would n't talk about the family . ''
`` Do n't you know them ? ''
asked Alan in astonishment .
`` Is n't your name Harmon ? ''
"`` That 's right -- Harmon -- Alfred Harmon , first mate of the schooner , Annie M. '' `` Alfred !"
I thought your name was Frank ! ''
`` Frank was my twin brother .
We were so much alike our own mammy could n't tell us apart .
Did you know Frank ? ''
`` No .
This family did .
Miss Oliver thought you were Frank when she saw you . ''
`` I do n't feel much like myself but I 'm not Frank anyway .
"He 's dead , poor chap -- got shot in a spat with Chinese pirates three years ago . ''"
`` Dead !
"Man , are you speaking the truth ?"
Are you certain ? ''
`` Pop sure .
His mate told me the whole story .
"Say , preacher , what 's the matter ?"
You look as if you were going to keel over . ''
Alan hastily drank a glass of water .
`` I -- I am all right now .
I have n't been feeling well of late . ''
`` Guess you did n't do yourself any good going out into that freezing water and dragging me in . ''
"`` I shall thank God every day of my life that I did do it , '' said Alan gravely , new light in his eyes , as Emily entered the room ."
"`` Miss Oliver , when will the Captain and Lynde be back ? ''"
`` They said they would be home by four . ''
She looked at Alan curiously .
"`` I will go and meet her , '' he said quickly ."
`` Would ye fyle your hands wi ' crime ? ''
`` Hoot ! ''
"said Alan , `` they 're baith crime , whatever !"
"And the killing 's easier , and quicker , and surer ."
"Keeping the lad 'll be a fashious * job , a fashious , kittle business . ''"
* Troublesome .
"`` I 'll have him keepit , though , '' returned my uncle ."
`` I never had naething to do with onything morally wrong ; and I 'm no gaun to begin to pleasure a wild Hielandman . ''
"`` Ye 're unco scrupulous , '' sneered Alan ."
"`` I 'm a man o ' principle , '' said Ebenezer , simply ; `` and if I have to pay for it , I 'll have to pay for it ."
"And besides , '' says he , `` ye forget the lad 's my brother 's son . ''"
"`` Well , well , '' said Alan , `` and now about the price ."
It 's no very easy for me to set a name upon it ; I would first have to ken some small matters .
"I would have to ken , for instance , what ye gave Hoseason at the first off-go ? ''"
`` Hoseason ! ''
"cries my uncle , struck aback ."
`` What for ? ''
"`` For kidnapping David , '' says Alan ."
"`` It 's a lee , it 's a black lee ! ''"
cried my uncle .
`` He was never kidnapped .
He leed in his throat that tauld ye that .
Kidnapped ?
He never was ! ''
"`` That 's no fault of mine nor yet of yours , '' said Alan ; `` nor yet of Hoseason 's , if he 's a man that can be trusted . ''"
`` What do ye mean ? ''
cried Ebenezer .
`` Did Hoseason tell ye ? ''
"`` Why , ye donnered auld runt , how else would I ken ? ''"
cried Alan .
`` Hoseason and me are partners ; we gang shares ; so ye can see for yoursel ' what good ye can do leeing .
And I must plainly say ye drove a fool 's bargain when ye let a man like the sailor-man so far forward in your private matters .
` To tell the other boys . '
"` Do n't go , Peter , ' she entreated , ' I know such lots of stories . '"
"Those were her precise words , so there can be no denying that it was she who first tempted him ."
"He came back , and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought to have alarmed her , but did not ."
"` Oh , the stories I could tell to the boys ! '"
"she cried , and then Peter gripped her and began to draw her toward the window ."
` Let me go ! '
she ordered him .
"` Wendy , do come with me and tell the other boys . '"
"Of course she was very pleased to be asked , but she said , ` Oh dear , I ca n't ."
Think of mummy !
"Besides , I ca n't fly . '"
` I 'll teach you . '
"` Oh , how lovely to fly . '"
"` I 'll teach you how to jump on the wind 's back , and then away we go . '"
` Oo ! '
she exclaimed rapturously .
"` Wendy , Wendy , when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be flying about with me saying funny things to the stars . '"
` Oo ! '
"` And , Wendy , there are mermaids . '"
` Mermaids !
With tails ? '
` Such long tails . '
"` Oh , ' cried Wendy , ` to see a mermaid ! '"
He had become frightfully cunning .
"` Wendy , ' he said , ` how we should all respect you . '"
She was wriggling her body in distress .
It was quite as if she were trying to remain on the nursery floor .
But he had no pity for her .
"` Wendy , ' he said , the sly one , ` you could tuck us in at night . '"
` Oo ! '
` None of us has ever been tucked in at night . '
I did but take a shot of the eye at Master Matcham . ''
"`` Sirrah , no more words , '' said Dick ."
`` Bend me your back . ''
"They were by that time at the mouth of the creek , and the view opened up and down the river ."
Everywhere it was enclosed with islands .
"Clay banks were falling in , willows nodding , reeds waving , martens dipping and piping ."
There was no sign of man in the labyrinth of waters .
"`` My master , '' said the ferryman , keeping the boat steady with one oar , `` I have a shrew guess that John-a-Fenne is on the island ."
He bears me a black grudge to all Sir Daniel 's .
How if I turned me up stream and landed you an arrow-flight above the path ?
Ye were best not meddle with John Fenne . ''
"`` How , then ?"
is he of this company ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` Nay , mum is the word , '' said Hugh ."
"`` But I would go up water , Dick ."
How if Master Matcham came by an arrow ? ''
and he laughed again .
"`` Be it so , Hugh , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Look ye , then , '' pursued Hugh ."
"`` Sith it shall so be , unsling me your cross-bow -- so : now make it ready -- good ; place me a quarrel ."
"Ay , keep it so , and look upon me grimly . ''"
`` What meaneth this ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` Why , my master , if I steal you across , it must be under force or fear , '' replied the ferryman ; `` for else , if John Fenne got wind of it , he were like to prove my most distressful neighbour . ''"
`` Do these churls ride so roughly ? ''
Dick inquired .
`` Do they command Sir Daniel 's own ferry ? ''
"`` Nay , '' whispered the ferryman , winking ."
`` Mark me !
Sir Daniel shall down .
His time is out .
said I. `` Is that to remind me you have been beaten on both sides ? ''
The air stopped on Alan 's lips .
`` David ! ''
said he .
"`` But it 's time these manners ceased , '' I continued ; `` and I mean you shall henceforth speak civilly of my King and my good friends the Campbells . ''"
`` I am a Stewart -- '' began Alan .
`` O ! ''
"says I , `` I ken ye bear a king 's name ."
"But you are to remember , since I have been in the Highlands , I have seen a good many of those that bear it ; and the best I can say of them is this , that they would be none the worse of washing . ''"
`` Do you know that you insult me ? ''
"said Alan , very low ."
"`` I am sorry for that , '' said I , `` for I am not done ; and if you distaste the sermon , I doubt the pirliecue * will please you as little ."
You have been chased in the field by the grown men of my party ; it seems a poor kind of pleasure to out-face a boy .
Both the Campbells and the Whigs have beaten you ; you have run before them like a hare .
It behoves you to speak of them as of your betters . ''
* A second sermon .
"Alan stood quite still , the tails of his great-coat clapping behind him in the wind ."
"`` This is a pity , '' he said at last ."
`` There are things said that can not be passed over . ''
"`` I never asked you to , '' said I. `` I am as ready as yourself . ''"
`` Ready ? ''
said he .
"`` Ready , '' I repeated ."
`` I am no blower and boaster like some that I could name .
Come on ! ''
"And drawing my sword , I fell on guard as Alan himself had taught me ."
`` David ! ''
he cried .
`` Are ye daft ?
"I cannae draw upon ye , David ."
It 's fair murder . ''
"`` That was your look-out when you insulted me , '' said I. `` It 's the truth ! ''"
"`` Nay , he would have me go !"
"If Sir Daniel slew him , when the hour comes this hand shall slay Sir Daniel ; but neither him nor his will I desert in peril ."
"And for mine oath , good Jack , ye shall absolve me of it here ."
"For the lives ' sake of many men that hurt you not , and for mine honour , ye shall set me free . ''"
"`` I , Dick ?"
Never ! ''
returned Matcham .
"`` An ye leave me , y ' are forsworn , and so I shall declare it . ''"
"`` My blood heats , '' said Dick ."
`` Give me the windac !
Give it me ! ''
"`` I 'll not , '' said Matcham ."
`` I 'll save you in your teeth . ''
`` Not ? ''
cried Dick .
`` I 'll make you ! ''
"`` Try it , '' said the other ."
"They stood , looking in each other 's eyes , each ready for a spring ."
"Then Dick leaped ; and though Matcham turned instantly and fled , in two bounds he was over-taken , the windac was twisted from his grasp , he was thrown roughly to the ground , and Dick stood across him , flushed and menacing , with doubled fist ."
"Matcham lay where he had fallen , with his face in the grass , not thinking of resistance ."
Dick bent his bow .
`` I 'll teach you ! ''
"he cried , fiercely ."
"`` Oath or no oath , ye may go hang for me ! ''"
And he turned and began to run .
"Matcham was on his feet at once , and began running after him ."
`` What d'ye want ? ''
"cried Dick , stopping ."
`` What make ye after me ?
Stand off ! ''
"`` Will follow an I please , '' said Matcham ."
`` This wood is free to me . ''
"I shall be sick , you know , ' Mr. Darling said threateningly ."
"` Come on , father , ' said John ."
"` Hold your tongue , John , ' his father rapped out ."
Wendy was quite puzzled . '
"I thought you took it quite easily , father . '"
"` That is not the point , ' he retorted ."
"` The point is , that there is more in my glass than in Michael 's spoon . '"
His proud heart was nearly bursting .
` And it is n't fair ; I would say it though it were with my last breath ; it is n't fair . '
"` Father , I am waiting , ' said Michael coldly ."
` It 's all very well to say you are waiting ; so am I waiting . '
` Father 's a cowardy custard . '
` So are you a cowardy custard . '
` I 'm not frightened . '
` Neither am I frightened . '
"` Well , then , take it . '"
"` Well , then , you take it . '"
Wendy had a splendid idea .
` Why not both take it at the same time ? '
"` Certainly , ' said Mr. Darling ."
"` Are you ready , Michael ? '"
"Wendy gave the words , one , two , three , and Michael took his medicine , but Mr. Darling slipped his behind his back ."
"There was a yell of rage from Michael , and ' O father ! '"
Wendy exclaimed .
` What do you mean by `` O father '' ? '
Mr. Darling demanded .
"` Stop that row , Michael ."
"I meant to take mine , but I -- I missed it . '"
"It was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him , just as if they did not admire him ."
"` Look here , all of you , ' he said entreatingly , as soon as Nana had gone into the bathroom , ' I have just thought of a splendid joke ."
"I shall pour my medicine into Nana 's bowl , and she will drink it , thinking it is milk ! '"
"It was the colour of milk ; but the children did not have their father 's sense of humour , and they looked at him reproachfully as he poured the medicine into Nana 's bowl ."
What would ye ?
"Ye run no great peril , man ; and these are in the way of death ."
Death ! ''
he added .
`` Think of it !
What a murrain do ye keep me here for ?
Give me the windac .
Saint George !
shall they all die ? ''
"`` Richard Shelton , '' said Matcham , looking him squarely in the face , `` would ye , then , join party with Sir Daniel ?"
Have ye not ears ?
"Heard ye not this Ellis , what he said ?"
or have ye no heart for your own kindly blood and the father that men slew ?
"` Harry Shelton , ' he said ; and Sir Harry Shelton was your father , as the sun shines in heaven . ''"
`` What would ye ? ''
Dick cried again .
`` Would ye have me credit thieves ? ''
"`` Nay , I have heard it before now , '' returned Matcham ."
"`` The fame goeth currently , it was Sir Daniel slew him ."
He slew him under oath ; in his own house he shed the innocent blood .
Heaven wearies for the avenging o n't ; and you -- the man 's son -- ye go about to comfort and defend the murderer ! ''
"`` Jack , '' cried the lad `` I know not ."
It may be ; what know I ?
"But , see here : This man hath bred me up and fostered me , and his men I have hunted with and played among ; and to leave them in the hour of peril -- O , man , if I did that , I were stark dead to honour !"
"Nay , Jack , ye would not ask it ; ye would not wish me to be base . ''"
"`` But your father , Dick ? ''"
"said Matcham , somewhat wavering ."
`` Your father ?
and your oath to me ?
Ye took the saints to witness . ''
`` My father ? ''
cried Shelton .
`` Who -- what was she ?
Did I dream her ?
Was she a phantom of delight ?
"No , no , phantoms do n't milk cows ."
She was flesh and blood .
No chilly nymph exhaling from the mists of the marsh could have given a kiss like that . ''
"`` Mollie has come to stay the rest of the summer with me , '' said Mrs. Palmer ."
`` I hope to goodness my tribulations with hired girls is over at last .
They have made a wreck of me . ''
Murray rapidly reflected .
"This development , he decided , released him from his promise to tell no tales ."
"`` I met a young lady down in the pond pasture this morning , '' he said deliberately ."
`` I talked with her for a few minutes .
I supposed her to be your niece .
Who was she ? ''
"`` Oh , that was Miss Mannering , '' said Mrs. Palmer ."
`` What ? ''
said Murray again .
"`` Mannering -- Dora Mannering , '' said Mrs. Palmer loudly , wondering if Mr. Murray were losing his hearing ."
`` She came here last night just to see me .
I have n't seen her since she was a child of twelve .
I used to be her nurse before I was married .
I was that proud to think she thought it worth her while to look me up .
"And , mind you , this morning , when she found me crippled with headache and not able to do a hand 's turn , that girl , Mr. Murray , went and milked seven cows '' -- `` only four , '' murmured Murray , but Mrs. Palmer did not hear him -- `` for me ."
Could n't prevent her .
"She said she had learned to milk for fun one summer when she was in the country , and she did it ."
And then she got breakfast for the men -- Mollie did n't come till the ten o'clock train .
Miss Mannering is as capable as if she had been riz on a farm . ''
`` Where is she now ? ''
demanded Murray .
"`` Oh , she 's gone . ''"
`` What ? ''
They would all have been glad to follow if he had done this .
But there was the arrow .
He took it from her heart and faced his band .
` Whose arrow ? '
he demanded sternly .
"` Mine , Peter , ' said Tootles on his knees ."
"` Oh , dastard hand , ' Peter said , and he raised the arrow to use it as a dagger ."
Tootles did not flinch .
He bared his breast .
"` Strike , Peter , ' he said firmly , ` strike true . '"
"Twice did Peter raise the arrow , and twice did his hand fall . '"
"I can not strike , ' he said with awe , ` there is something stays my hand . '"
"All looked at him in wonder , save Nibs , who fortunately looked at Wendy ."
"` It is she , ' he cried , ` the Wendy lady ; see , her arm . '"
"Wonderful to relate , Wendy had raised her arm ."
Nibs bent over her and listened reverently . '
"I think she said `` Poor Tootles , '' ' he whispered ."
"` She lives , ' Peter said briefly ."
"Slightly cried instantly , ` The Wendy lady lives . '"
Then Peter knelt beside her and found his button .
You remember she had put it on a chain that she wore round her neck .
"` See , ' he said , ` the arrow struck against this ."
It is the kiss I gave her .
It has saved her life . ' '
"I remember kisses , ' Slightly interposed quickly , ` let me see it ."
"Ay , that 's a kiss . '"
Peter did not hear him .
"He was begging Wendy to get better quickly , so that he could show her the mermaids ."
"Of course she could not answer yet , being still in a frightful faint ; but from overhead came a wailing note ."
"` Listen to Tink , ' said Curly , ` she is crying because the Wendy lives . '"
"Then they had to tell Peter of Tink 's crime , and almost never had they seen him look so stern ."
"` Listen , Tinker Bell , ' he cried ; ' I am your friend no more ."
It is only the gay and innocent and heartless who can fly . ''
`` What is gay and innocent and heartless ?
I do wish I were gay and innocent and heartless . ''
Or perhaps Wendy admits she does see something .
"`` I do believe , '' she says , `` that it is this nursery . ''"
"`` I do believe it is , '' says Jane ."
`` Go on . ''
They are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when Peter flew in looking for his shadow .
"`` The foolish fellow , '' says Wendy , `` tried to stick it on with soap , and when he could not he cried , and that woke me , and I sewed it on for him . ''"
"`` You have missed a bit , '' interrupts Jane , who now knows the story better than her mother ."
"`` When you saw him sitting on the floor crying , what did you say ? ''"
"`` I sat up in bed and I said , ` Boy , why are you crying ? ' ''"
"`` Yes , that was it , '' says Jane , with a big breath ."
"`` And then he flew us all away to the Neverland and the fairies and the pirates and the redskins and the mermaid 's lagoon , and the home under the ground , and the little house . ''"
`` Yes !
which did you like best of all ? ''
`` I think I liked the home under the ground best of all . ''
"`` Yes , so do I ."
What was the last thing Peter ever said to you ? ''
"`` The last thing he ever said to me was , ` Just always be waiting for me , and then some night you will hear me crowing . ' ''"
`` Yes . ''
"`` But , alas , he forgot all about me , '' Wendy said it with a smile ."
She was as grown up as that .
`` What did his crow sound like ? ''
Jane asked one evening .
"`` It was like this , '' Wendy said , trying to imitate Peter 's crow ."
"`` No , it was n't , '' Jane said gravely , `` it was like this ; '' and she did it ever so much better than her mother ."
Wendy was a little startled .
"`` My darling , how can you know ? ''"
"`` I often hear it when I am sleeping , '' Jane said ."
"`` Ah yes , many girls hear it when they are sleeping , but I was the only one who heard it awake . ''"
"`` Lucky you , '' said Jane ."
"I thought you would want it back , ' he said a little bitterly , and offered to return her the thimble ."
"` Oh dear , ' said the nice Wendy , ' I do n't mean a kiss , I mean a thimble . '"
` What 's that ? '
` It 's like this . '
She kissed him .
` Funny ! '
said Peter gravely .
` Now shall I give you a thimble ? '
"` If you wish to , ' said Wendy , keeping her head erect this time ."
"Peter thimbled her , and almost immediately she screeched ."
"` What is it , Wendy ? '"
` It was exactly as if some one were pulling my hair . '
` That must have been Tink .
I never knew her so naughty before . '
"And indeed Tink was darting about again , using offensive language ."
"` She says she will do that to you , Wendy , every time I give you a thimble . '"
` But why ? '
"` Why , Tink ? '"
"Again Tink replied , ` You silly ass . '"
"Peter could not understand why , but Wendy understood ; and she was just slightly disappointed when he admitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her but to listen to stories ."
` You see I do n't know any stories .
None of the lost boys know any stories . '
"` How perfectly awful , ' Wendy said ."
"` Do you know , ' Peter asked , ` why swallows build in the eaves of houses ?"
It is to listen to the stories .
"O Wendy , your mother was telling you such a lovely story . '"
` Which story was it ? '
` About the prince who could n't find the lady who wore the glass slipper . '
"` Peter , ' said Wendy excitedly , ` that was Cinderella , and he found her , and they lived happy ever after . '"
"Peter was so glad that he rose from the floor , where they had been sitting , and hurried to the window ."
` Where are you going ? '
she cried with misgiving .
"`` By the powers , Tom Morgan , it 's as good for you ! ''"
exclaimed the landlord .
"`` If you had been mixed up with the like of that , you would never have put another foot in my house , you may lay to that ."
And what was he saying to you ? ''
"`` I do n't rightly know , sir , '' answered Morgan ."
"`` Do you call that a head on your shoulders , or a blessed dead-eye ? ''"
cried Long John .
"`` Do n't rightly know , do n't you !"
"Perhaps you do n't happen to rightly know who you was speaking to , perhaps ?"
"Come , now , what was he jawing -- v ` yages , cap'n s , ships ?"
Pipe up !
What was it ? ''
"`` We was a-talkin ' of keel-hauling , '' answered Morgan ."
"`` Keel-hauling , was you ?"
"And a mighty suitable thing , too , and you may lay to that ."
"Get back to your place for a lubber , Tom . ''"
"And then , as Morgan rolled back to his seat , Silver added to me in a confidential whisper that was very flattering , as I thought , `` He 's quite an honest man , Tom Morgan , on ' y stupid ."
"And now , '' he ran on again , aloud , `` let 's see -- Black Dog ?"
"No , I do n't know the name , not I ."
"Yet I kind of think I 've -- yes , I 've seen the swab ."
"He used to come here with a blind beggar , he used . ''"
"`` That he did , you may be sure , '' said I. `` I knew that blind man too ."
His name was Pew . ''
`` It was ! ''
"cried Silver , now quite excited ."
`` Pew !
That were his name for certain .
"Ah , he looked a shark , he did !"
"If we run down this Black Dog , now , there 'll be news for Cap'n Trelawney !"
Ben 's a good runner ; few seamen run better than Ben .
"He should run him down , hand over hand , by the powers !"
"He talked o ' keel-hauling , did he ?"
` Is Wendy asleep ? '
they asked .
` Yes . '
"` John , ' Michael proposed , ` let us wake her and get her to make supper for us ' ; but as he said it some of the other boys rushed on carrying branches for the building of the house ."
` Look at them ! '
he cried .
"` Curly , ' said Peter in his most captainy voice , ` see that these boys help in the building of the house . '"
"` Ay , ay , sir . '"
` Build a house ? '
exclaimed John .
"` For the Wendy , ' said Curly ."
` For Wendy ? '
"John said , aghast ."
"` Why , she is only a girl . '"
"` That , ' explained Curly , ` is why we are her servants . '"
` You ?
Wendy 's servants ! '
"` Yes , ' said Peter , ` and you also ."
Away with them . '
The astounded brothers were dragged away to hack and hew and carry .
"` Chairs and a fender first , ' Peter ordered ."
` Then we shall build the house round them . '
"` Ay , ' said Slightly , ` that is how a house is built ; it all comes back to me . '"
Peter thought of everything .
"` Slightly , ' he ordered , ` fetch a doctor . '"
"` Ay , ay , ' said Slightly at once , and disappeared , scratching his head ."
"But he knew Peter must be obeyed , and he returned in a moment , wearing John 's hat and looking solemn ."
"` Please , sir , ' said Peter , going to him , ` are you a doctor ? '"
"The difference between him and the other boys at such a time was that they knew it was make-believe , while to him make-believe and true were exactly the same thing ."
"This sometimes troubled them , as when they had to make-believe that they had had their dinners ."
If they broke down in their make-believe he rapped them on the knuckles .
"` Yes , my little man , ' anxiously replied Slightly , who had chapped knuckles ."
"`` Fellow , '' he asked , `` were ye here when this house was taken ? ''"
"`` Let be , '' said the archer ."
`` A murrain !
"let be , or I strike . ''"
"`` Hark ye , '' returned Richard , `` two can play at that ."
Stand and be plain . ''
"But the man , flushed with drink and battle , struck Dick upon the shoulder with one hand , while with the other he twitched away his garment ."
Thereupon the full wrath of the young leader burst from his control .
"He seized the fellow in his strong embrace , and crushed him on the plates of his mailed bosom like a child ; then , holding him at arm 's length , he bid him speak as he valued life ."
`` I pray you mercy ! ''
gasped the archer .
`` An I had thought ye were so angry I would ` a ' been charier of crossing you .
I was here indeed . ''
`` Know ye Sir Daniel ? ''
pursued Dick .
"`` Well do I know him , '' returned the man ."
`` Was he in the mansion ? ''
"`` Ay , sir , he was , '' answered the archer ; `` but even as we entered by the yard gate he rode forth by the garden . ''"
`` Alone ? ''
cried Dick .
"`` He may ` a ' had a score of lances with him , '' said the man ."
`` Lances !
"No women , then ? ''"
asked Shelton .
"`` Troth , I saw not , '' said the archer ."
"`` But there were none in the house , if that be your quest . ''"
"`` I thank you , '' said Dick ."
`` Here is a piece for your pains . ''
"But groping in his wallet , Dick found nothing ."
"`` Inquire for me to-morrow , '' he added -- `` Richard Shelt -- Sir Richard Shelton , '' he corrected , `` and I will see you handsomely rewarded . ''"
And then an idea struck Dick .
"He hastily descended to the courtyard , ran with all his might across the garden , and came to the great door of the church ."
`` No ; but I 'm bothered .
"I want some money , and I do n't see how I can earn it , '' he answered , tumbling his hair about , and frowning darkly at the fire ."
`` How much ? ''
"and Jill 's ready hand went to the pocket where her little purse lay , for she felt rich with several presents lately made her ."
`` Two seventy-five .
"No , thank you , I wo n't borrow . ''"
`` What is it for ? ''
`` Ca n't tell . ''
"`` Why , I thought you told me everything . ''"
"`` Sorry , but I ca n't this time ."
Do n't you worry ; I shall think of something . ''
`` Could n't your mother help ? ''
`` Do n't wish to ask her . ''
`` Why !
ca n't she know ? ''
`` Nobody can . ''
`` How queer !
"Is it a scrape , Jack ? ''"
"asked Jill , looking as curious as a magpie ."
"`` It is likely to be , if I ca n't get out of it this week , somehow . ''"
"`` Well , I do n't see how I can help if I 'm not to know anything ; '' and Jill seemed rather hurt ."
"`` You can just stop asking questions , and tell me how a fellow can earn some money ."
That would help .
"I 've got one dollar , but I must have some more ; '' and Jack looked worried as he fingered the little gold dollar on his watch-guard ."
"`` Oh , do you mean to use that ? ''"
"`` Yes , I do ; a man must pay his debts if he sells all he has to do it , '' said Jack sternly ."
`` Dear me ; it must be something very serious . ''
"And Jill lay quite still for five minutes , thinking over all the ways in which Jack ever did earn money , for Mrs. Minot liked to have her boys work , and paid them in some way for all they did ."
`` Is there any wood to saw ? ''
"she asked presently , being very anxious to help ."
`` All done . ''
`` Paths to shovel ? ''
"`` Well , see here : you dinnae want the lad back ; well , what do ye want done with him , and how much will ye pay ? ''"
"My uncle made no answer , but shifted uneasily on his seat ."
"`` Come , sir , '' cried Alan ."
`` I would have you to ken that I am a gentleman ; I bear a king 's name ; I am nae rider to kick my shanks at your hall door .
"Either give me an answer in civility , and that out of hand ; or by the top of Glencoe , I will ram three feet of iron through your vitals . ''"
"`` Eh , man , '' cried my uncle , scrambling to his feet , `` give me a meenit !"
What 's like wrong with ye ?
I 'm just a plain man and nae dancing master ; and I 'm tryin to be as ceevil as it 's morally possible .
"As for that wild talk , it 's fair disrepitable ."
"Vitals , says you !"
And where would I be with my blunderbush ? ''
he snarled .
"`` Powder and your auld hands are but as the snail to the swallow against the bright steel in the hands of Alan , '' said the other ."
"`` Before your jottering finger could find the trigger , the hilt would dirl on your breast-bane . ''"
"`` Eh , man , whae 's denying it ? ''"
said my uncle .
"`` Pit it as ye please , hae ' t your ain way ; I 'll do naething to cross ye ."
"Just tell me what like ye 'll be wanting , and ye 'll see that we 'll can agree fine . ''"
"`` Troth , sir , '' said Alan , `` I ask for nothing but plain dealing ."
In two words : do ye want the lad killed or kept ? ''
"`` O , sirs ! ''"
cried Ebenezer .
"`` O , sirs , me !"
that 's no kind of language ! ''
`` Killed or kept ! ''
repeated Alan .
"`` O , keepit , keepit ! ''"
wailed my uncle .
"`` We 'll have nae bloodshed , if you please . ''"
"`` Well , '' says Alan , `` as ye please ; that 'll be the dearer . ''"
`` The dearer ? ''
cries Ebenezer .
"`` One Joan Sedley , '' replied Matcham , colouring ."
"`` It was Sir Daniel 's doing ; he hath money to gain upon both sides ; and , indeed , I have heard the poor wench bemoaning herself pitifully of the match ."
"It seems she is of your mind , or else distasted to the bridegroom . ''"
`` Well !
"marriage is like death , it comes to all , '' said Dick , with resignation ."
`` And she bemoaned herself ?
"I pray ye now , see there how shuttle-witted are these girls : to bemoan herself before that she had seen me !"
Do I bemoan myself ?
Not I .
"An I be to marry , I will marry dry-eyed !"
"But if ye know her , prithee , of what favour is she ?"
fair or foul ?
And is she shrewish or pleasant ? ''
"`` Nay , what matters it ? ''"
said Matcham .
"`` An y ' are to marry , ye can but marry ."
What matters foul or fair ?
These be but toys .
"Y ' are no milksop , Master Richard ; ye will wed with dry eyes , anyhow . ''"
"`` It is well said , '' replied Shelton ."
`` Little I reck . ''
"`` Your lady wife is like to have a pleasant lord , '' said Matcham ."
"`` She shall have the lord Heaven made her for , '' returned Dick ."
`` It trow there be worse as well as better . ''
"`` Ah , the poor wench ! ''"
cried the other .
`` And why so poor ? ''
asked Dick .
"`` To wed a man of wood , '' replied his companion ."
"`` O me , for a wooden husband ! ''"
"`` I think I be a man of wood , indeed , '' said Dick , `` to trudge afoot the while you ride my horse ; but it is good wood , I trow . ''"
"`` Good Dick , forgive me , '' cried the other ."
"He saw Matcham fall ; and on the instant his spirit and his strength revived ; With a cry of pity and anger , he unslung and bent his arblast ."
"But ere he had time to shoot , the leper held up his hand ."
"`` Hold your shot , Dickon ! ''"
cried a familiar voice .
"`` Hold your shot , mad wag !"
Know ye not a friend ? ''
"And then laying down Matcham on the turf , he undid the hood from off his face , and disclosed the features of Sir Daniel Brackley ."
`` Sir Daniel ! ''
cried Dick .
"`` Ay , by the mass , Sir Daniel ! ''"
returned the knight .
"`` Would ye shoot upon your guardian , rogue ?"
"But here is this '' -- And there he broke off , and pointing to Matcham , asked : `` How call ye him , Dick ? ''"
"`` Nay , '' said Dick , `` I call him Master Matcham ."
Know ye him not ?
He said ye knew him ! ''
"`` Ay , '' replied Sir Daniel , `` I know the lad ; '' and he chuckled ."
"`` But he has fainted ; and , by my sooth , he might have had less to faint for !"
"Hey , Dick ?"
Did I put the fear of death upon you ? ''
"`` Indeed , Sir Daniel , ye did that , '' said Dick , and sighed again at the mere recollection ."
"`` Nay , sir , saving your respect , I had as lief ` a ' met the devil in person ; and to speak truth , I am yet all a-quake ."
"But what made ye , sir , in such a guise ? ''"
Sir Daniel 's brow grew suddenly black with anger .
`` What made I ? ''
he said .
`` Ye do well to mind me of it !
What ?
"I skulked for my poor life in my own wood of Tunstall , Dick ."
We were ill sped at the battle ; we but got there to be swept among the rout .
Where be all my good men-at-arms ?
"Dick , by the mass , I know not !"
"Wendy was now almost overhead , and they could hear her plaintive cry ."
But more distinct came the shrill voice of Tinker Bell .
"The jealous fairy had now cast off all disguise of friendship , and was darting at her victim from every direction , pinching savagely each time she touched ."
"` Hullo , Tink , ' cried the wondering boys ."
Tink 's reply rang out : ` Peter wants you to shoot the Wendy . '
It was not in their nature to question when Peter ordered .
"` Let us do what Peter wishes , ' cried the simple boys ."
"` Quick , bows and arrows . '"
All but Tootles popped down their trees .
"He had a bow and arrow with him , and Tink noted it , and rubbed her little hands ."
"` Quick , Tootles , quick , ' she screamed ."
` Peter will be so pleased . '
Tootles excitedly fitted the arrow to his bow .
"` Out of the way , Tink , ' he shouted ; and then he fired , and Wendy fluttered to the ground with an arrow in her breast ."
"CHAPTER VI THE LITTLE HOUSE Foolish Tootles was standing like a conqueror over Wendy 's body when the other boys sprang , armed , from their trees ."
"` You are too late , ' he cried proudly , ' I have shot the Wendy ."
Peter will be so pleased with me . '
Overhead Tinker Bell shouted ` Silly ass ! '
and darted into hiding .
The others did not hear her .
"They had crowded round Wendy , and as they looked a terrible silence fell upon the wood ."
If Wendy 's heart had been beating they would all have heard it .
Slightly was the first to speak .
"` This is no bird , ' he said in a scared voice . '"
I think it must be a lady . ' '
A lady ? '
"said Tootles , and fell a-trembling ."
"` And we have killed her , ' Nibs said hoarsely ."
They all whipped off their caps .
"` Now I see , ' Curly said ; ` Peter was bringing her to us . '"
He threw himself sorrowfully on the ground . '
"A lady to take care of us at last , ' said one of the twins , ` and you have killed her . '"
asked Matcham .
"`` Never a girl for me , '' returned Dick ."
`` I do abjure the crew of them ! ''
"`` Ye speak boyishly , '' said the other ."
`` Ye think more of them than ye pretend . ''
"`` Not I , '' said Dick , stoutly ."
`` They come not in my mind .
"A plague of them , say I !"
"Give me to hunt and to fight and to feast , and to live with jolly foresters ."
"I never heard of a maid yet that was for any service , save one only ; and she , poor shrew , was burned for a witch and the wearing of men 's clothes in spite of nature . ''"
"Master Matcham crossed himself with fervour , and appeared to pray ."
`` What make ye ? ''
Dick inquired .
"`` I pray for her spirit , '' answered the other , with a somewhat troubled voice ."
`` For a witch 's spirit ? ''
Dick cried .
"`` But pray for her , an ye list ; she was the best wench in Europe , was this Joan of Arc ."
"Old Appleyard the archer ran from her , he said , as if she had been Mahoun ."
"Nay , she was a brave wench . ''"
"`` Well , but , good Master Richard , '' resumed Matcham , `` an ye like maids so little , y ' are no true natural man ; for God made them twain by intention , and brought true love into the world , to be man 's hope and woman 's comfort . ''"
`` Faugh ! ''
said Dick .
"`` Y ' are a milk-sopping baby , so to harp on women ."
"An ye think I be no true man , get down upon the path , and whether at fists , back-sword , or bow and arrow , I will prove my manhood on your body . ''"
"`` Nay , I am no fighter , '' said Matcham , eagerly ."
`` I mean no tittle of offence .
I meant but pleasantry .
"And if I talk of women , it is because I heard ye were to marry . ''"
`` I to marry ! ''
Dick exclaimed .
"`` Well , it is the first I hear of it ."
And with whom was I to marry ? ''
Let me see -- let me put on my thinking cap .
What is your name ? ''
`` Marcella Langley . ''
The older woman dropped the lingerie waist she was pretending to examine and stared at Marcella .
`` You do n't say !
"Look here , what was your mother 's name before she was married ? ''"
`` Mary Carvell . ''
"`` Well , I have heard of coincidences , but this beats all !"
Mary Carvell !
"Well , did you ever hear your mother speak of a girl friend of hers called Josephine Draper ? ''"
`` I should think I did !
You do n't mean -- '' `` I do mean it .
I 'm Josephine Draper .
"Your mother and I went to school together , and we were as much as sisters to each other until she got married ."
"Then she went away , and after a few years I lost trace of her ."
I did n't even know she was dead .
Poor Mary !
"Well , my duty is plain -- that 's one comfort -- my duty and my pleasure , too ."
Your sister is coming out to Dalesboro to stay with me .
"Yes , and you are too , for the whole summer ."
"You need n't say you 're not , because you are ."
I 've said so .
There 's room at Fir Cottage for you both .
"Yes , Fir Cottage -- I guess you 've heard your mother speak of that ."
There 's her old room out there that we always slept in when she came to stay all night with me .
It 's all ready for you .
What 's that ?
You ca n't afford to lose your place here ?
"Bless your heart , child , you wo n't lose it !"
"The owner of this store is my nephew , and he 'll do considerable to oblige me , as well he might , seeing as I brought him up ."
"To think that Mary Carvell 's daughter has been in his store for three years , and me never suspecting it !"
And I might never have found you out at all if you had n't been so patient with that woman .
"I promised to care for you as far as Holywood , and , by the rood , Jack , y ' are more capable to care for me . ''"
"`` Well , Dick , we 're friends now , '' said Matcham ."
"`` Nay , I never was unfriends , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Y ' are a brave lad in your way , albeit something of a milksop , too ."
I never met your like before this day .
"But , prithee , fetch back your breath , and let us on ."
Here is no place for chatter . ''
"`` My foot hurts shrewdly , '' said Matcham ."
"`` Nay , I had forgot your foot , '' returned Dick ."
"`` Well , we must go the gentlier ."
I would I knew rightly where we were .
"I have clean lost the path ; yet that may be for the better , too ."
"An they watch the ferry , they watch the path , belike , as well ."
I would Sir Daniel were back with two score men ; he would sweep me these rascals as the wind sweeps leaves .
"Come , Jack , lean ye on my shoulder , ye poor shrew ."
"Nay , y ' are not tall enough ."
"What age are ye , for a wager ?"
-- twelve ? ''
"`` Nay , I am sixteen , '' said Matcham ."
"`` Y ' are poorly grown to height , then , '' answered Dick ."
`` But take my hand .
"We shall go softly , never fear ."
"I owe you a life ; I am a good repayer , Jack , of good or evil . ''"
They began to go forward up the slope .
"`` We must hit the road , early or late , '' continued Dick ; `` and then for a fresh start ."
By the mass !
"but y ' ` ave a rickety hand , Jack ."
"If I had a hand like that , I would think shame ."
"I tell you , '' he went on , with a sudden chuckle , `` I swear by the mass I believe Hugh Ferryman took you for a maid . ''"
"`` Nay , never ! ''"
"cried the other , colouring high ."
"`` A ' did , though , for a wager ! ''"
"He came upon Lynde , sitting on a grey boulder under the shadow of an overhanging fir coppice , with her dogs beside her ."
"She turned her head indifferently as Alan 's footsteps sounded on the pebbles , and then stood slowly up ."
`` Are you looking for me ? ''
she asked .
"`` I have some news for you , Lynde , '' Alan said ."
`` Has he -- has he come to himself ? ''
she whispered .
"`` Yes , he has come to himself ."
"Lynde , he is not Frank Harmon -- he is his twin brother ."
He says Frank Harmon was killed three years ago in the China seas . ''
"For a moment Lynde 's great grey eyes stared into Alan 's , questioning ."
"Then , as the truth seized on her comprehension , she sat down on the boulder and put her hands over her face without a word ."
Alan walked down to the water 's edge to give her time to recover herself .
"When he came back he took her hands and said quietly , `` Lynde , do you realize what this means for us -- for us ?"
You are free -- free to love me -- to be my wife . ''
Lynde shook her head .
"`` Oh , that ca n't be ."
I am not fit to be your wife . ''
"`` Do n't talk nonsense , dear , '' he smiled ."
`` It is n't nonsense .
You are a minister and it would ruin you to marry a girl like me .
Think what the Rexton people would say of it . ''
"`` Rexton is n't the world , dearest ."
Last week I had a letter from home asking me to go to a church there .
"I did not think of accepting then -- now I will go -- we will both go -- and a new life will begin for you , clear of the shadows of the old . ''"
`` That is n't possible .
"No , Alan , listen -- I love you too well to do you the wrong of marrying you ."
It would injure you .
There is Father .
I love him and he has always been very kind to me .
But -- but -- there 's something wrong -- you know it -- some crime in his past -- '' `` The only man who knew that is dead . ''
`` We do not know that he was the only man .
"Pew was that sort , and he died a beggar-man ."
"Flint was , and he died of rum at Savannah ."
"Ah , they was a sweet crew , they was !"
"On ` y , where are they ? ''"
"`` But , '' asked Dick , `` when we do lay 'em athwart , what are we to do with 'em , anyhow ? ''"
`` There 's the man for me ! ''
cried the cook admiringly .
`` That 's what I call business .
"Well , what would you think ?"
Put 'em ashore like maroons ?
That would have been England 's way .
Or cut 'em down like that much pork ?
"That would have been Flint 's , or Billy Bones 's . ''"
"`` Billy was the man for that , '' said Israel . ''"
"` Dead men do n't bite , ' says he ."
"Well , he 's dead now hisself ; he knows the long and short on it now ; and if ever a rough hand come to port , it was Billy . ''"
"`` Right you are , '' said Silver ; `` rough and ready ."
"But mark you here , I 'm an easy man -- I 'm quite the gentleman , says you ; but this time it 's serious ."
"Dooty is dooty , mates ."
I give my vote -- death .
"When I 'm in Parlyment and riding in my coach , I do n't want none of these sea-lawyers in the cabin a-coming home , unlooked for , like the devil at prayers ."
"Wait is what I say ; but when the time comes , why , let her rip ! ''"
"`` John , '' cries the coxswain , `` you 're a man ! ''"
"`` You 'll say so , Israel when you see , '' said Silver ."
`` Only one thing I claim -- I claim Trelawney .
"I 'll wring his calf 's head off his body with these hands , Dick ! ''"
"he added , breaking off ."
"`` You just jump up , like a sweet lad , and get me an apple , to wet my pipe like . ''"
You may fancy the terror I was in !
"I should have leaped out and run for it if I had found the strength , but my limbs and heart alike misgave me ."
"I heard Dick begin to rise , and then someone seemingly stopped him , and the voice of Hands exclaimed , `` Oh , stow that !"
"Do n't you get sucking of that bilge , John ."
John paled .
"` It is this , if we meet Hook in open fight , you must leave him to me . ' '"
"I promise , ' John said loyally ."
"For the moment they were feeling less eerie , because Tink was flying with them , and in her light they could distinguish each other ."
"Unfortunately she could not fly so slowly as they , and so she had to go round and round them in a circle in which they moved as in a halo ."
"Wendy quite liked it , until Peter pointed out the drawback ."
"` She tells me , ' he said , ` that the pirates sighted us before the darkness came , and got Long Tom out . '"
` The big gun ? '
` Yes .
"And of course they must see her light , and if they guess we are near it they are sure to let fly . '"
` Wendy ! '
` John ! '
` Michael ! '
"` Tell her to go away at once , Peter , ' the three cried simultaneously , but he refused ."
"` She thinks we have lost the way , ' he replied stiffly , ` and she is rather frightened ."
You do n't think I would send her away all by herself when she is frightened ! '
"For a moment the circle of light was broken , and something gave Peter a loving little pinch ."
"` Then tell her , ' Wendy begged , ` to put out her light . '"
` She ca n't put it out .
That is about the only thing fairies ca n't do .
"It just goes out of itself when she falls asleep , same as the stars . '"
"` Then tell her to sleep at once , ' John almost ordered ."
` She ca n't sleep except when she 's sleepy .
It is the only other thing fairies ca n't do . '
"` Seems to me , ' growled John , ` these are the only two things worth doing . '"
"Here he got a pinch , but not a loving one ."
"` If only one of us had a pocket , ' Peter said , ` we could carry her in it . '"
"However , they had set off in such a hurry that there was not a pocket between the four of them ."
He had a happy idea .
John 's hat !
Tink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand .
"John carried it , though she had hoped to be carried by Peter ."
"`` Let me brush your hair now , dear , and bathe your face . ''"
`` Have you time ? ''
said Patty anxiously .
"`` Yes , I think so . ''"
Patty gave a sigh of content .
`` I 'm so glad !
Aunt Emma always hurts me when she brushes my hair -- she is in such a hurry .
"You 're so gentle , Marcella , you do n't make my head ache at all ."
But oh !
I 'm so tired of being sick .
I wish I could get well faster .
"Marcy , do you think I can be sent to the country ? ''"
"`` I -- I do n't know , dear ."
"I 'll see if I can think of any way to manage it , '' said Marcella , striving to speak hopefully ."
Patty drew a long breath .
"`` Oh , Marcy , it would be lovely to see the green fields again , and the woods and brooks , as we did that summer we spent in the country before Father died ."
I wish we could live in the country always .
I 'm sure I would soon get better if I could go -- if it was only for a little while .
It 's so hot here -- and the factory makes such a noise -- my head seems to go round and round all the time .
And Aunt Emma scolds so . ''
"`` You must n't mind Aunt Emma , dear , '' said Marcella ."
`` You know she does n't really mean it -- it is just a habit she has got into .
She was really very good to you when you were so sick .
"She sat up night after night with you , and made me go to bed ."
"There now , dearie , you 're fresh and sweet , and I must hurry to the store , or I 'll be late ."
"Try and have a little nap , and I 'll bring you home some oranges tonight . ''"
"Marcella dropped a kiss on Patty 's cheek , put on her hat and went out ."
"As soon as she left the house , she quickened her steps almost to a run ."
"She feared she would be late , and that meant a ten-cent fine ."
Ten cents loomed as large as ten dollars now to Marcella 's eyes when every dime meant so much .
"But fast as she went , her distracted thoughts went faster ."
She could not send Patty to the country .
"he questioned sadly , after a silence ."
"`` I think I am , '' said Sara ."
She kept her stately head averted .
"`` If -- if you have loved me , Jeff , why did you never tell me so before ? ''"
`` How could I dare ? ''
he said gravely .
`` I knew I could never win you -- that I had no right to dream of you so .
"Oh , Sara , do n't be angry !"
My love has been reverent and humble .
I have asked nothing .
I ask nothing now but your friendship .
"Do n't take that from me , Sara ."
Do n't be angry with me . ''
"`` I am angry , '' repeated Sara , `` and I think I have a right to be . ''"
"`` Perhaps so , '' he said simply , `` but not because I have loved you ."
"Such love as mine ought to anger no woman , Sara ."
But you have a right to be angry with me for presuming to put it into words .
I should not have done so -- but I could not help it .
It rushed to my lips in spite of me .
Forgive me . ''
"`` I do n't know whether I can forgive you for not telling me before , '' said Sara steadily . ''"
"That is what I have to forgive -- not your speaking at last , even if it was dragged from you against your will ."
"Did you think I would make you such a very poor wife , Jeff , that you would not ask me to marry you ? ''"
`` Sara ! ''
"he said , aghast ."
`` I -- I -- you were as far above me as a star in the sky -- I never dreamed -- I never hoped -- '' `` That I could care for you ? ''
"said Sara , looking round at last ."
"`` Then you were more modest than a man ought to be , Jeff ."
"I did not know that you loved me , or I should have found some way to make you speak out long ago ."
I should not have let you waste all these years .
"I 've loved you -- ever since we picked mayflowers on the hill , I think -- ever since I came home from school , I know ."
"I never cared for anyone else -- although I tried to , when I thought you did n't care for me ."
Begone from me for ever . '
"She flew on to his shoulder and pleaded , but he brushed her off ."
"Not until Wendy again raised her arm did he relent sufficiently to say , ` Well , not for ever , but for a whole week . '"
Do you think Tinker Bell was grateful to Wendy for raising her arm ?
"Oh dear no , never wanted to pinch her so much ."
"Fairies indeed are strange , and Peter , who understood them best , often cuffed them ."
But what to do with Wendy in her present delicate state of health ?
"` Let us carry her down into the house , ' Curly suggested ."
"` Ay , ' said Slightly , ` that is what one does with ladies . '"
"` No , no , ' Peter said , ` you must not touch her ."
It would not be sufficiently respectful . '
"` That , ' said Slightly , ` is what I was thinking . '"
"` But if she lies there , ' Tootles said , ` she will die . '"
"` Ay , she will die , ' Slightly admitted , ` but there is no way out . '"
"` Yes , there is , ' cried Peter ."
` Let us build a little house round her . '
They were all delighted .
"` Quick , ' he ordered them , ` bring me each of you the best of what we have ."
Gut our house .
Be sharp . '
In a moment they were as busy as tailors the night before a wedding .
"They skurried this way and that , down for bedding , up for firewood , and while they were at it , who should appear but John and Michael ."
"As they dragged along the ground they fell asleep standing , stopped , woke up , moved another step and slept again ."
"` John , John , ' Michael would cry , ` wake up ."
"Where is Nana , John , and mother ? '"
"And then John would rub his eyes and mutter , ` It is true , we did fly . '"
You may be sure they were very relieved to find Peter .
"` Hullo , Peter , ' they said ."
"` Hullo , ' replied Peter amicably , though he had quite forgotten them ."
He was very busy at the moment measuring Wendy with his feet to see how large a house she would need .
Of course he meant to leave room for chairs and a table .
John and Michael watched him .
gasped Appleyard .
`` I be done with Old England .
Pluck it out ! ''
"`` Master Dick , '' said Bennet , `` come hither , and pull me a good pull upon the arrow ."
"He would fain pass , the poor sinner . ''"
"Dick laid down his cross-bow , and pulling hard upon the arrow , drew it forth ."
"A gush of blood followed ; the old archer scrambled half upon his feet , called once upon the name of God , and then fell dead ."
"Hatch , upon his knees among the cabbages , prayed fervently for the welfare of the passing spirit ."
"But even as he prayed , it was plain that his mind was still divided , and he kept ever an eye upon the corner of the wood from which the shot had come ."
"When he had done , he got to his feet again , drew off one of his mailed gauntlets , and wiped his pale face , which was all wet with terror ."
"`` Ay , '' he said , `` it 'll be my turn next . ''"
"`` Who hath done this , Bennet ? ''"
"Richard asked , still holding the arrow in his hand ."
"`` Nay , the saints know , '' said Hatch ."
"`` Here are a good two score Christian souls that we have hunted out of house and holding , he and I ."
"He has paid his shot , poor shrew , nor will it be long , mayhap , ere I pay mine ."
Sir Daniel driveth over-hard . ''
"`` This is a strange shaft , '' said the lad , looking at the arrow in his hand ."
"`` Ay , by my faith ! ''"
cried Bennet .
"`` Black , and black-feathered ."
"Here is an ill-favoured shaft , by my sooth !"
"for black , they say , bodes burial ."
And here be words written .
Wipe the blood away .
What read ye ? '' '' '
"Appulyaird fro Jon Amend-All , ' '' read Shelton ."
`` What should this betoken ? ''
"`` Nay , I like it not , '' returned the retainer , shaking his head ."
`` John Amend-All !
Here is a rogue 's name for those that be up in the world !
But why stand we here to make a mark ?
"They were sorry for him , but sorrier for themselves , and when he took a step nearer them they turned from him ."
"Tootles ' face was very white , but there was a dignity about him now that had never been there before . '"
"I did it , ' he said , reflecting ."
"` When ladies used to come to me in dreams , I said , `` Pretty mother , pretty mother . ''"
"But when at last she really came , I shot her . '"
He moved slowly away .
"` Do n't go , ' they called in pity . '"
"I must , ' he answered , shaking ; ' I am so afraid of Peter . '"
It was at this tragic moment that they heard a sound which made the heart of every one of them rise to his mouth .
They heard Peter crow .
` Peter ! '
"they cried , for it was always thus that he signalled his return ."
"` Hide her , ' they whispered , and gathered hastily around Wendy ."
But Tootles stood aloof .
"Again came that ringing crow , and Peter dropped in front of them ."
"` Greeting , boys , ' he cried , and mechanically they saluted , and then again was silence ."
He frowned . '
"I am back , ' he said hotly , ` why do you not cheer ? '"
"They opened their mouths , but the cheers would not come ."
He overlooked it in his haste to tell the glorious tidings .
"` Great news , boys , ' he cried , ' I have brought at last a mother for you all . '"
"Still no sound , except a little thud from Tootles as he dropped on his knees ."
` Have you not seen her ? '
"asked Peter , becoming troubled ."
` She flew this way . '
"` Ah me , ' one voice said , and another said , ` Oh , mournful day . '"
Tootles rose .
"` Peter , ' he said quietly , ' I will show her to you ' ; and when the others would still have hidden her he said , ` Back , twins , let Peter see . '"
"So they all stood back , and let him see , and after he had looked for a little time he did not know what to do next ."
"` She is dead , ' he said uncomfortably ."
` Perhaps she is frightened at being dead . '
"He thought of hopping off in a comic sort of way till he was out of sight of her , and then never going near the spot any more ."
he cried .
"`` Why , in a place like this , where nobody puts in but gen ` lemen of fortune , Silver would fly the Jolly Roger , you do n't make no doubt of that ."
"No , that 's your friends ."
"There 's been blows too , and I reckon your friends has had the best of it ; and here they are ashore in the old stockade , as was made years and years ago by Flint ."
"Ah , he was the man to have a headpiece , was Flint !"
"Barring rum , his match were never seen ."
"He were afraid of none , not he ; on ' y Silver -- Silver was that genteel . ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` that may be so , and so be it ; all the more reason that I should hurry on and join my friends . ''"
"`` Nay , mate , '' returned Ben , `` not you ."
"You 're a good boy , or I 'm mistook ; but you 're on ' y a boy , all told ."
"Now , Ben Gunn is fly ."
"Rum would n't bring me there , where you 're going -- not rum would n't , till I see your born gen ` leman and gets it on his word of honour ."
"And you wo n't forget my words ; ' A precious sight -LRB- that 's what you 'll say -RRB- , a precious sight more confidence ' -- and then nips him . ''"
And he pinched me the third time with the same air of cleverness .
"`` And when Ben Gunn is wanted , you know where to find him , Jim ."
Just wheer you found him today .
"And him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand , and he 's to come alone ."
Oh !
"And you 'll say this : ` Ben Gunn , ' says you , ` has reasons of his own . ' ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` I believe I understand ."
"You have something to propose , and you wish to see the squire or the doctor , and you 're to be found where I found you ."
Is that all ? ''
`` And when ?
"says you , '' he added ."
"`` Why , from about noon observation to about six bells . ''"
"`` Good , '' said I , `` and now may I go ? ''"
`` You wo n't forget ? ''
he inquired anxiously .
"`` Precious sight , and reasons of his own , says you ."
Reasons of his own ; that 's the mainstay ; as between man and man .
"Well , then '' -- still holding me -- `` I reckon you can go , Jim ."
"And , Jim , if you was to see Silver , you would n't go for to sell Ben Gunn ?"
"Here 's this squire and doctor with a map and such -- I do n't know where it is , do I ?"
"No more do you , says you ."
"Well then , I mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff , and help us to get it aboard , by the powers ."
Then we 'll see .
"If I was sure of you all , sons of double Dutchmen , I 'd have Cap'n Smollett navigate us half-way back again before I struck . ''"
"`` Why , we 're all seamen aboard here , I should think , '' said the lad Dick ."
"`` We 're all forecastle hands , you mean , '' snapped Silver ."
"`` We can steer a course , but who 's to set one ?"
"That 's what all you gentlemen split on , first and last ."
"If I had my way , I 'd have Cap'n Smollett work us back into the trades at least ; then we 'd have no blessed miscalculations and a spoonful of water a day ."
But I know the sort you are .
"I 'll finish with 'em at the island , as soon 's the blunt 's on board , and a pity it is ."
But you 're never happy till you 're drunk .
"Split my sides , I 've a sick heart to sail with the likes of you ! ''"
"`` Easy all , Long John , '' cried Israel ."
`` Who 's a-crossin ' of you ? ''
"`` Why , how many tall ships , think ye , now , have I seen laid aboard ?"
And how many brisk lads drying in the sun at Execution Dock ? ''
cried Silver .
`` And all for this same hurry and hurry and hurry .
You hear me ?
"I seen a thing or two at sea , I have ."
"If you would on ' y lay your course , and a p ` int to windward , you would ride in carriages , you would ."
But not you !
I know you .
"You 'll have your mouthful of rum tomorrow , and go hang . ''"
"`` Everybody knowed you was a kind of a chapling , John ; but there 's others as could hand and steer as well as you , '' said Israel ."
"`` They liked a bit o ' fun , they did ."
"They was n't so high and dry , nohow , but took their fling , like jolly companions every one . ''"
`` So ? ''
says Silver .
"`` Well , and where are they now ?"
"When Mrs. Liddell had gone , she rose and leaned over the counter ."
Marcella opened her burning eyes and pulled herself wearily together .
`` What can I do for you ? ''
she said .
`` Nothing .
I ai n't looking for to have anything done for me .
"You need to have something done for you , I guess , by the looks of you ."
You seem dead beat out .
Are n't you awful tired ?
I 've been listening to that woman jawing you till I felt like rising up and giving her a large and wholesome piece of my mind .
"I do n't know how you kept your patience with her , but I can tell you I admired you for it , and I made up my mind I 'd tell you so . ''"
The kindness and sympathy in her tone broke Marcella down .
Tears rushed to her eyes .
"She bowed her head on her hands and said sobbingly , `` Oh , I am tired !"
But it 's not that .
I 'm -- I 'm in such trouble . ''
"`` I knew you were , '' said the other , with a nod of her head ."
`` I could tell that right off by your face .
Do you know what I said to myself ?
"I said , ` That girl has got somebody at home awful sick . '"
That 's what I said .
Was I right ? ''
"`` Yes , indeed you were , '' said Marcella ."
`` I knew it '' -- another triumphant nod .
"`` Now , you just tell me all about it ."
It 'll do you good to talk it over with somebody .
"Here , I 'll pretend I 'm looking at shirtwaists , so that floor walker wo n't be coming down on you , and I 'll be as hard to please as that other woman was , so 's you can take your time ."
Who 's sick -- and what 's the matter ? ''
"Marcella told the whole story , choking back her sobs and forcing herself to speak calmly , having the fear of the floor walker before her eyes ."
"`` And I ca n't afford to send Patty to the country -- I ca n't -- and I know she wo n't get better if she does n't go , '' she concluded ."
"`` Dear , dear , but that 's too bad !"
Something must be done .
He knew now that he had made a mistake in coming tonight ; he could not help her .
His own pain had unmanned him .
Presently he would say something foolish or selfish in spite of himself .
Sara turned her eyes on him .
"`` There is nothing anybody can do , Jeff , '' she said piteously ."
"Her eyes , those clear child-eyes , filled with tears ."
`` I shall be braver -- stronger -- after a while .
But just now I have no strength left .
"I feel like a lost , helpless child ."
"Oh , Jeff ! ''"
She put her slender hands over her face and sobbed .
Every sob cut Jeffrey to the heart .
"`` Do n't -- do n't , Sara , '' he said huskily ."
`` I ca n't bear to see you suffer so .
I 'd die for you if it would do you any good .
I love you -- I love you !
"I never meant to tell you so , but it is the truth ."
I ought n't to tell you now .
Do n't think that I 'm trying to take any advantage of your loneliness and sorrow .
I know -- I have always known -- that you are far above me .
"But that could n't prevent my loving you -- just humbly loving you , asking nothing else ."
"You may be angry with my presumption , but I ca n't help telling you that I love you ."
That 's all .
I just want you to know it . ''
Sara had turned away her head .
Jeffrey was overcome with contrition .
"Ah , he had no business to speak so -- he had spoiled the devotion of years ."
Who was he that he should have dared to love her ?
"Silence alone had justified his love , and now he had lost that justification ."
She would despise him .
He had forfeited her friendship for ever .
"`` Are you angry , Sara ? ''"
"`` Why , '' I cried , `` the squire 's a gentleman ."
"And besides , if we got rid of the others , we should want you to help work the vessel home . ''"
"`` Ah , '' said he , `` so you would . ''"
And he seemed very much relieved .
"`` Now , I 'll tell you what , '' he went on ."
"`` So much I 'll tell you , and no more ."
I were in Flint 's ship when he buried the treasure ; he and six along -- six strong seamen .
"They was ashore nigh on a week , and us standing off and on in the old WALRUS ."
"One fine day up went the signal , and here come Flint by himself in a little boat , and his head done up in a blue scarf ."
"The sun was getting up , and mortal white he looked about the cutwater ."
"But , there he was , you mind , and the six all dead -- dead and buried ."
"How he done it , not a man aboard us could make out ."
"It was battle , murder , and sudden death , leastways -- him against six ."
"Billy Bones was the mate ; Long John , he was quartermaster ; and they asked him where the treasure was ."
"` Ah , ' says he , ` you can go ashore , if you like , and stay , ' he says ; ` but as for the ship , she 'll beat up for more , by thunder ! '"
That 's what he said .
"`` Well , I was in another ship three years back , and we sighted this island ."
"` Boys , ' said I , ` here 's Flint 's treasure ; let 's land and find it . '"
"The cap'n was displeased at that , but my messmates were all of a mind and landed ."
"Twelve days they looked for it , and every day they had the worse word for me , until one fine morning all hands went aboard ."
"` As for you , Benjamin Gunn , ' says they , ` here 's a musket , ' they says , ` and a spade , and pick-axe ."
"You can stay here and find Flint 's money for yourself , ' they says ."
"`` Well , Jim , three years have I been here , and not a bite of Christian diet from that day to this ."
"But now , you look here ; look at me ."
Do I look like a man before the mast ?
"No , says you ."
"Nor I were n't , neither , I says . ''"
And with that he winked and pinched me hard .
"`` Just you mention them words to your squire , Jim , '' he went on ."
"`` Nor he were n't , neither -- that 's the words ."
"Three years he were the man of this island , light and dark , fair and rain ; and sometimes he would maybe think upon a prayer -LRB- says you -RRB- , and sometimes he would maybe think of his old mother , so be as she 's alive -LRB- you 'll say -RRB- ; but the most part of Gunn 's time -LRB- this is what you 'll say -RRB- -- the most part of his time was took up with another matter ."
"And then you 'll give him a nip , like I do . ''"
A sweet pretty place you have of it here .
"Ah , there 's Jim !"
"The top of the morning to you , Jim ."
"Doctor , here 's my service ."
"Why , there you all are together like a happy family , in a manner of speaking . ''"
"`` If you have anything to say , my man , better say it , '' said the captain ."
"`` Right you were , Cap'n Smollett , '' replied Silver ."
"`` Dooty is dooty , to be sure ."
"Well now , you look here , that was a good lay of yours last night ."
I do n't deny it was a good lay .
Some of you pretty handy with a handspike-end .
And I 'll not deny neither but what some of my people was shook -- maybe all was shook ; maybe I was shook myself ; maybe that 's why I 'm here for terms .
"But you mark me , cap'n , it wo n't do twice , by thunder !"
We 'll have to do sentry-go and ease off a point or so on the rum .
Maybe you think we were all a sheet in the wind 's eye .
"But I 'll tell you I was sober ; I was on ' y dog tired ; and if I 'd awoke a second sooner , I 'd ' a caught you at the act , I would ."
"He was n't dead when I got round to him , not he . ''"
`` Well ? ''
says Captain Smollett as cool as can be .
"All that Silver said was a riddle to him , but you would never have guessed it from his tone ."
"As for me , I began to have an inkling ."
Ben Gunn 's last words came back to my mind .
"I began to suppose that he had paid the buccaneers a visit while they all lay drunk together round their fire , and I reckoned up with glee that we had only fourteen enemies to deal with ."
"`` Well , here it is , '' said Silver ."
"`` We want that treasure , and we 'll have it -- that 's our point !"
"You would just as soon save your lives , I reckon ; and that 's yours ."
"You have a chart , have n't you ? ''"
"`` That 's as may be , '' replied the captain ."
"`` Oh , well , you have , I know that , '' returned Long John ."
"`` You need n't be so husky with a man ; there ai n't a particle of service in that , and you may lay to it ."
"What I mean is , we want your chart ."
"Now , I never meant you no harm , myself . ''"
How the Raja's Son won the Princess Labam.
"In a country there was a Raja who had an only son who every day went out to hunt. One day the Rani, his mother, said to him, ""You can hunt wherever you like on these three sides; but you must never go to the fourth side."" This she said because she knew if he went on the fourth side he would hear of the beautiful Princess Labam, and that then he would leave his father and mother and seek for the princess."
"The young prince listened to his mother, and obeyed her for some time; but one day, when he was hunting on the three sides where he was allowed to go, he remembered what she had said to him about the fourth side, and he determined to go and see why she had forbidden him to hunt on that side. When he got there, he found himself in a jungle, and nothing in the jungle but a quantity of parrots, who lived in it."
"The young Raja shot at some of them, and at once they all flew away up to the sky. All, that is, but one, and this was their Raja, who was called Hiraman parrot."
"When Hiraman parrot found himself left alone, he called out to the other parrots, ""Don't fly away and leave me alone when the Raja's son shoots. If you desert me like this, I will tell the Princess Labam."""
"Then the parrots all flew back to their Raja, chattering. The prince was greatly surprised, and said, ""Why, these birds can talk!"" Then he said to the parrots, ""Who is the Princess Labam? Where does she live?"""
"But the parrots would not tell him where she lived. ""You can never get to the Princess Labam's country."" That is all they would say."
"The prince grew very sad when they would not tell him anything more; and he threw his gun away, and went home. When he got home, he would not speak or eat, but lay on his bed for four or five days, and seemed very ill."
"At last he told his father and mother that he wanted to go and see the Princess Labam. ""I must go,"" he said; ""I must see what she is like."
"Tell me where her country is."""
"""We do not know where it is,"" answered his father and mother."
"""Then I must go and look for it,"" said the prince."
"""No, no,"" they said, ""you must not leave us. You are our only son."
"Stay with us. You will never find the Princess Labam."""
"""I must try and find her,"" said the prince. ""Perhaps God will show me the way. If I live and I find her, I will come back to you; but perhaps I shall die, and then I shall never see you again. Still I must go."""
"So they had to let him go, though they cried very much at parting with him. His father gave him fine clothes to wear, and a fine horse. And he took his gun, and his bow and arrows, and a great many other weapons, ""for,"" he said, ""I may want them."" His father, too, gave him plenty of rupees."
"Then he himself got his horse all ready for the journey, and he said good-bye to his father and mother; and his mother took her handkerchief and wrapped some sweetmeats in it, and gave it to her son. ""My child,"" she said to him, ""When you are hungry eat some of these sweetmeats."""
"He then set out on his journey, and rode on and on till he came to a jungle in which were a tank and shady trees. He bathed himself and his horse in the tank, and then sat down under a tree. ""Now,"" he said to himself, ""I will eat some of the sweetmeats my mother gave me, and I will drink some water, and then I will continue my journey."" He opened his handkerchief, and took out a sweetmeat. He found an ant in it. He took out another. There was an ant in that one too. So he laid the two sweetmeats on the ground, and he took out another, and another, and another, until he had taken them all out; but in each he found an ant."
"""Never mind,"" he said, ""I won't eat the sweetmeats; the ants shall eat them."" Then the Ant-Raja came and stood before him and said, ""You have been good to us. If ever you are in trouble, think of me and we will come to you."""
"The Raja's son thanked him, mounted his horse and continued his journey. He rode on and on until he came to another jungle, and there he saw a tiger who had a thorn in his foot, and was roaring loudly from the pain."
"""Why do you roar like that?"" said the young Raja. ""What is the matter with you?"""
"""I have had a thorn in my foot for twelve years,"" answered the tiger, ""and it hurts me so; that is why I roar."""
"""Well,"" said the Raja's son, ""I will take it out for you. But perhaps, as you are a tiger, when I have made you well, you will eat me?"""
"""Oh, no,"" said the tiger, ""I won't eat you. Do make me well."""
"Then the prince took a little knife from his pocket, and cut the thorn out of the tiger's foot; but when he cut, the tiger roared louder than ever so loud that his wife heard him in the next jungle, and came bounding along to see what was the matter. The tiger saw her coming, and hid the prince in the jungle, so that she should not see him."
"""What man hurt you that you roared so loud?"" said the wife."
"""No one hurt me,"" answered the husband; ""but a Raja's son came and took the thorn out of my foot."""
"""Where is he? Show him to me,"" said his wife."
"""If you promise not to kill him, I will call him,"" said the tiger."
"""I won't kill him; only let me see him,"" answered his wife."
"""Well! well!"" said Boots; ""but now that I am here, I may as well try what I can do with him; and I will see if I can't free my brothers, who are standing turned to stone out of doors; and you, too, I will try to save, that I will."""
"""Well, if you must, you must,"" said the Princess; ""and so let us see if we can't hit on a plan. Just creep under the bed yonder, and mind and listen to what he and I talk about. But, pray, do lie as still as a mouse."""
"So he crept under the bed, and he had scarce got well underneath it, before the Giant came."
"""Ha!"" roared the Giant, ""what a smell of Christian blood there is in the house!"""
"""Yes, I know there is,"" said the Princess, ""for there came a magpie flying with a man's bone, and let it fall down the chimney. I made all the haste I could to get it out, but all one can do, the smell doesn't go off so soon."""
"So the Giant said no more about it, and when night came, they went to bed. After they had lain a while, the Princess said:"
"""There is one thing I'd be so glad to ask you about, if I only dared."""
"""What thing is that?"" asked the Giant."
"""Only where it is you keep your heart, since you don't carry it about you,"" said the Princess."
"""Ah! that's a thing you've no business to ask about; but if you must know, it lies under the door-sill,"" said the Giant."
"""Ho! ho!"" said Boots to himself under the bed, ""then we'll soon see if we can't find it."""
"Next morning the Giant got up cruelly early, and strode off to the wood; but he was hardly out of the house before Boots and the Princess set to work to look under the door-sill for his heart; but the more they dug, and the more they hunted, the more they couldn't find it."
"""He has baulked us this time,"" said the Princess, ""but we'll try him once more."""
"So she picked all the prettiest flowers she could find, and strewed them over the door-sill, which they had laid in its right place again; and when the time came for the Giant to come home again, Boots crept under the bed. Just as he was well under, back came the Giant."
"Snuff snuff, went the Giant's nose. ""My eyes and limbs, what a smell of Christian blood there is in here,"" said he."
"""I know there is,"" said the Princess, ""for there came a magpie flying with a man's bone in his bill, and let it fall down the chimney. I made as much haste as I could to get it out, but I daresay it's that you smell."""
"So the Giant held his peace, and said no more about it. A little while after, he asked who it was that had strewed flowers about the door-sill."
"""Oh, I, of course,"" said the Princess."
"""And, pray, what's the meaning of all this?"" said the Giant."
"""Ah!"" said the Princess, ""I'm so fond of you that I couldn't help strewing them, when I knew that your heart lay under there."""
"""You don't say so,"" said the Giant; ""but after all it doesn't lie there at all."""
"So when they went to bed again in the evening, the Princess asked the Giant again where his heart was, for she said she would so like to know."
"""Well,"" said the Giant, ""if you must know, it lies away yonder in the cupboard against the wall."""
"""So, so!"" thought Boots and the Princess; ""then we'll soon try to find it."""
"Next morning the Giant was away early, and strode off to the wood, and so soon as he was gone Boots and the Princess were in the cupboard hunting for his heart, but the more they sought for it, the less they found it."
"""Well,"" said the Princess, ""we'll just try him once more."""
"So she decked out the cupboard with flowers and garlands, and when the time came for the Giant to come home, Boots crept under the bed again."
Then back came the Giant.
"Snuff snuff! ""My eyes and limbs, what a smell of Christian blood there is in here!"""
"""I know there is,"" said the Princess; ""for a little while since there came a magpie flying with a man's bone in his bill, and let it fall down the chimney. I made all the haste I could to get it out of the house again; but after all my pains, I daresay it's that you smell."""
"When the Giant heard that, he said no more about it; but a little while after, he saw how the cupboard was all decked about with flowers and garlands; so he asked who it was that had done that? Who could it be but the Princess?"
"""And, pray, what's the meaning of all this tomfoolery?"" asked the Giant."
"""You are very good, and very clever, and very dear,"" said the Princess, smiling and giving him both her hands."
He shut a little kiss in each hand before he let them go.
"""So now, when the tide is low again, I will take you away in my boat,"""
he said.
"""But what about the dragon and the griffin?"" asked the Princess."
"""Dear me,"" said Nigel. ""I didn't know about them. I suppose I can kill them?"""
"""Don't be a silly boy,"" said the Princess, pretending to be very grown up, for, though she had been on the island time only knows how many years, she was just eighteen, and she still liked pretending. ""You haven't a sword, or a shield, or anything!"""
"""Well, don't the beasts ever go to sleep?"""
"""Why, yes,"" said the Princess, ""but only once in twenty-four hours, and then the dragon is turned to stone. But the griffin has dreams. The griffin sleeps at teatime every day, but the dragon sleeps every day for five minutes, and every day it is three minutes later than it was the day before."""
"""What time does he sleep today?"" asked Nigel."
"""At eleven,"" said the Princess."
"""Ah,"" said Nigel, ""can you do sums?"""
"""No,"" said the Princess sadly. ""I was never good at them."""
"""Then I must,"" said Nigel. ""I can, but it's slow work, and it makes me very unhappy. It'll take me days and days."""
"""Don't begin yet,"" said the Princess. ""You'll have plenty of time to be unhappy when I'm not with you. Tell me all about yourself."""
So he did. And then she told him all about herself.
"""I know I've been here a long time,"" she said, ""but I don't know what Time is. And I am very busy sewing silk flowers on a golden gown for my wedding day. And the griffin does the housework his wings are so convenient and feathery for sweeping and dusting. And the dragon does the cooking he's hot inside, so, of course, it's no trouble to him; and though I don't know what Time is I'm sure it's time for my wedding day, because my golden gown only wants one more white daisy on the sleeve, and a lily on the bosom of it, and then it will be ready."""
"Just then they heard a dry, rustling clatter on the rocks above them and a snorting sound. ""It's the dragon,"" said the Princess hurriedly."
"""Good-bye. Be a good boy, and get your sum done."" And she ran away and left him to his arithmetic."
"Now, the sum was this: ""If the whirlpools stop and the tide goes down once in every twenty-four hours, and they do it five minutes earlier every twenty-four hours, and if the dragon sleeps every day, and he does it three minutes later every day, in how many days and at what time in the day will the tide go down three minutes before the dragon falls asleep?"""
"It is quite a simple sum, as you see: You could do it in a minute because you have been to a good school and have taken pains with your lessons; but it was quite otherwise with poor Nigel. He sat down to work out his sum with a piece of chalk on a smooth stone. He tried it by practice and the unitary method, by multiplication, and by rule-of-three-and-three-quarters. He tried it by decimals and by compound interest. He tried it by square root and by cube root. He tried it by addition, simple and otherwise, and he tried it by mixed examples in vulgar fractions. But it was all of no use. Then he tried to do the sum by algebra, by simple and by quadratic equations, by trigonometry, by logarithms, and by conic sections. But it would not do. He got an answer every time, it is true, but it was always a different one, and he could not feel sure which answer was right."
"And just as he was feeling how much more important than anything else it is to be able to do your sums, the Princess came back. And now it was getting dark."
"""Why, you've been seven hours over that sum,"" she said, ""and you haven't done it yet. Look here, this is what is written on the tablet of the statue by the lower gate. It has figures in it. Perhaps it is the answer to the sum."""
"She held out to him a big white magnolia leaf. And she had scratched on it with the pin of her pearl brooch, and it had turned brown where she had scratched it, as magnolia leaves will do. Nigel read:"
AFTER NINE DAYS         T ii. 24.
D ii. 27 Ans.
P.S. And the griffin is artificial. R.
He clapped his hands softly.
"""Dear Princess,"" he said, ""I know that's the right answer. It says R too, you see. But I'll just prove it."" So he hastily worked the sum backward in decimals and equations and conic sections, and all the rules he could think of. And it came right every time."
"""So now we must wait,"" said he. And they waited."
"And every day the Princess came to see Nigel and brought him food cooked by the dragon, and he lived in his cave, and talked to her when she was there, and thought about her when she was not, and they were both as happy as the longest day in summer. Then at last came The Day. Nigel and the Princess laid their plans."
"""You're sure he won't hurt you, my only treasure?"" said Nigel."
"""No! only just look,"" they said; ""there the fool sits still."""
"The next day when they went out to battle, they saw the lad sitting there still, so they laughed again, and made game of him; but as soon as ever they had ridden by, the lad ran again to the lime-tree, and all happened as on the first day. Every one wondered what strange champion it could be that had helped them, but no one got so near him as to say a word to him; and no one guessed it could be the lad; that's easy to understand."
"So when they went home at night, and saw the lad still sitting there on his hack, they burst out laughing at him again, and one of them shot an arrow at him and hit him in the leg. So he began to shriek and to bewail; 'twas enough to break one's heart; and so the King threw his pocket-handkerchief to him to bind his wound."
"When they went out to battle the third day, the lad still sat there."
"""Gee up! gee up!"" he said to his hack."
"""Nay, nay,"" said the King's men; ""if he won't stick there till he's starved to death."""
"And then they rode on, and laughed at him till they were fit to fall from their horses. When they were gone, he ran again to the lime, and came up to the battle just in the very nick of time. This day he slew the enemy's king, and then the war was over at once."
"When the battle was over, the King caught sight of his handkerchief, which the strange warrior had bound round his leg, and so it wasn't hard to find him out. So they took him with great joy between them to the palace, and the Princess, who saw him from her window, got so glad, no one can believe it."
"""Here comes my own true love,"" she said."
"Then he took the pot of ointment and rubbed himself on the leg, and after that he rubbed all the wounded, and so they all got well again in a moment."
"So he got the Princess to wife; but when he went down into the stable where his horse was on the day the wedding was to be, there it stood so dull and heavy, and hung its ears down, and wouldn't eat its corn. So when the young King for he was now a king, and had got half the kingdom spoke to him, and asked what ailed him, the Horse said:"
"""Now I have helped you on, and now I won't live any longer. So just take the sword, and cut my head off."""
"""No, I'll do nothing of the kind,"" said the young King; ""but you shall have all you want, and rest all your life."""
"""Well,"" said the Horse, ""if you don't do as I tell you, see if I don't take your life somehow."""
"So the King had to do what he asked; but when he swung the sword and was to cut his head off, he was so sorry he turned away his face, for he would not see the stroke fall. But as soon as ever he had cut off the head, there stood the loveliest Prince on the spot where the horse had stood."
"""Why, where in all the world did you come from?"" asked the King."
"""It was I who was a horse,"" said the Prince; ""for I was king of that land whose king you slew yesterday. He it was who threw this Troll's shape over me, and sold me to the Troll. But now he is slain I get my own again, and you and I will be neighbour kings, but war we will never make on one another."""
"And they didn't either; for they were friends as long as they lived, and each paid the other very many visits."
THE THREE BILLY-GOATS GRUFF
"Once on a time there were three Billy-goats, who were to go up to the hill-side to make themselves fat, and the name of all three was ""Gruff."""
"On the way up was a bridge over a burn they had to cross; and under the bridge lived a great ugly Troll, with eyes as big as saucers, and a nose as long as a poker."
So first of all came the youngest billy-goat Gruff to cross the bridge.
"""Trip, trap! trip, trap!"" went the bridge."
"""Who's that tripping over my bridge?"" roared the Troll."
"""Oh! it is only I, the tiniest billy-goat Gruff; and I'm going up to the hill-side to make myself fat,"" said the billy-goat, with such a small voice."
"""Now, I'm coming to gobble you up,"" said the Troll."
"""Oh, no! pray don't take me. I'm too little, that I am,"" said the billy-goat; ""wait a bit till the second billy-goat Gruff comes, he's much bigger."""
"""Well! be off with you,"" said the Troll."
A little while after came the second billy-goat Gruff to cross the bridge.
"""TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP! TRIP, TRAP!"" went the bridge."
"""WHO'S THAT tripping over my bridge?"" roared the Troll."
"""Oh! It's the second billy-goat Gruff, and I'm going up to the hill-side to make myself fat,"" said the billy-goat, who hadn't such a small voice."
"The little Bats flitted along after her, and Papa Bat came behind them."
"They had been flying through the starlit forest all night, chasing the many small insects that come out after the sun has gone down, and passing in and out of the tangled branches without ever touching one."
"Indeed, Mamma Bat would have been ashamed if children of hers flew against anything in the dark. There might be some excuse for such a mistake in the daytime, for Bats' eyes do not see well then, but in the night-time! She would have scolded them well, and they would have deserved it, for Bats have the most wonderful way of feeling things before they touch them, and there are no other people in the forest who can do that. There are no other people who can tell by the feeling of the air when something is near, and the Bats made much fun of their friend, the Screech Owl, once, when he flew against a tree and fell to the ground."
And now the night was over and their mother had called them to go home.
"One of the little Bats hung back with a very cross look on his face, and twice his father had to tell him to fly faster. He was thinking how he would like to see the forest in the daytime. He had never seen the sun rise, and he wanted to do that. He had never seen any of the day-birds or the animals that awaken in the morning. He thought it was pretty mean to make poor little Bats go off to bed the minute the stars began to fade. He didn't believe what his father and mother said, that he wouldn't have a good time if he did stay up. He had coaxed and coaxed and teased and teased, but it hadn't made a bit of difference. Every morning he had to fold his wings and go to sleep in a dark crack in the rock of the cave, hanging, head downward, close to the rest of the family. Their father said that there never was a better place to sleep than in this same crack, and it certainly was easy to catch on with the hooks at the lower ends of their wings when they hung themselves up for the day. But now he just wouldn't go to bed, so there!"
"""It is your turn next,"" said Mamma Bat to him, when the rest of the children had hung themselves up."
"""I'm not going to bed,"" the little Bat answered."
"""Not going to bed!"" said his father. ""Are you crazy?"""
"""No,"" said the little Bat, ""I'm not."""
"""I don't believe the child is well,"" said Mamma Bat. ""He never acted like this before. I'm afraid he has overeaten."" And she looked very anxious."
"""I am well, and I haven't eaten too much,"" said the little Bat. ""I think you might let a fellow have some fun once in a while. I've never seen the sun in my life, and there are whole lots of birds and animals in the forest that I've only heard about."""
Papa and Mamma Bat looked at each other without speaking.
"""I won't go to bed!"" said the little Bat."
"""Very well,"" said his father. ""I shall not try to make you. Fly away at once and let us go to sleep."""
"After he had gone, Mamma Bat said, ""I suppose you did right to let him go, but it seems too bad that children have to find out for themselves the trouble that comes from disobedience."""
"The little Bat flew away feeling very brave. He guessed he knew how to take care of himself, even in daylight. He felt sorry for his brothers who were in the cave, but he made up his mind that he would tell them all about it the next night."
"The eastern sky grew brighter and brighter. It hurt his eyes to look at it, and he blinked and turned away. Then the song-birds awakened and began to sing. It was very interesting, but he thought they sang too loudly. The forest at night is a quiet place, and he didn't see the sense of shouting so, even if the sun were coming up. The night-birds never made such a fuss over the moon, and he guessed the moon was as good as the sun."
"Somebody went scampering over the grass, kicking up his heels as he ran."
"""That must be a Rabbit,"" thought the little Bat. ""The Screech Owl told me that Rabbits run in that way. I wish I could see him more plainly. I don't know what is the matter with my eyes."""
"Just then a sunbeam came slanting through the forest and fell on his furry coat as he clung to a branch. ""Ow!"" he cried. ""Ow! How warm it is!"
"I don't like that. The moonbeams do not feel so. I must fly to a shady corner."" He started to fly. Just what was the matter, he never knew. It may have been because he couldn't see well, it may have been because he was getting very tired, or it may have been because the strangeness of it all was beginning to frighten him; but at all events, he went down, down, down until he found himself pitching and tumbling around in the grass."
"A Crow had seen him fall, and cried loudly, ""Come! Come! Come!"" to his friends. The Rabbits, who were feeding near by, came scampering along, making great leaps in their haste to see what was the matter. The Goldfinches, the Robins, the Orioles, the Woodpeckers, and many other birds came fluttering up. Even a Blue Jay sat on a branch above the Bat and shrieked, ""Jay! Jay! Jay!"" to add to the excitement. And last of all, the Ground Hog appeared, coming slowly and with dignity, as a person who can remember his grandfather should do."
"""What is the cause of all this commotion?"" he asked. He might have said, ""What is the matter?"" and then they would have understood him at once, but he was too haughty for that. He thought he had to use big words once in a while to show that he could. If people didn't understand them, he was willing to explain what he meant."
"""We've found such a queer bird, sir,"" said the biggest little Rabbit, without waiting to find out what a ""commotion"" was. ""Just see him tumble around!"""
"""Bird? That is no bird,"" said a Woodpecker. ""Look at his ears and his nose. He hasn't even a bill."""
"""Well, he flies,"" said the biggest little Rabbit, ""because I saw him, so he must be a bird."""
"""Humph!"" said a Chipmunk. ""So does my cousin, the Flying Squirrel, in a way, yet he is no more bird than I am."""
"""And this fellow hasn't a feather to his skin!"" cried an Oriole."
"""I don't say that my son is right,"" said Papa Rabbit, ""but this creature has wings."" And he gave the Bat a poke that made him flutter wildly for a minute."
"""Yes, but what kind of wings?"" asked the Goldfinch. ""A pair of skinny things that grow on to his legs and have hooks on both ends."""
"""He must be a very stupid fellow, at all events,"" said the Ground Hog."
"""He doesn't talk, or walk, or eat, or even fly well. He must come of a very common family. For my part, I am not interested in persons of that kind."" And he walked away with his nose in the air."
"When it was morning the old woman said to the Raja's son, ""Now you must really go."""
"""Aunty,"" he answered, ""I am not well enough yet. Let me stay a few days longer. I will remain hidden in your house, so that no one may see me."" So the old woman let him stay."
"When it was black night, the princess put on her lovely clothes and jewels, and sat on her roof. At midnight she went to her room and went to sleep. Then the Raja's son sat on his bed and flew to her bed-room."
"There he said to his bag, ""Bag, I want a very, very beautiful ring."""
"The bag gave him a glorious ring. Then he took the Princess Labam's hand gently to put on the ring, and she started up very much frightened."
"""Who are you?"" she said to the prince. ""Where do you come from? Why do you come to my room?"""
"""Do not be afraid, princess,"" he said; ""I am no thief. I am a great Raja's son. Hiraman parrot, who lives in the jungle where I went to hunt, told me your name, and then I left my father and mother, and came to see you."""
"""Well,"" said the princess, ""as you are the son of such a great Raja, I will not have you killed, and I will tell my father and mother that I wish to marry you."""
"The prince then returned to the old woman's house; and when morning came the princess said to her mother, ""The son of a great Raja has come to this country, and I wish to marry him."" Her mother told this to the king."
"""Good,"" said the king; ""but if this Raja's son wishes to marry my daughter, he must first do whatever I bid him. If he fails I will kill him. I will give him eighty pounds weight of mustard seed, and out of this he must crush the oil in one day. If he cannot do this he shall die."""
"In the morning the Raja's son told the old woman that he intended to marry the princess. ""Oh,"" said the old woman, ""go away from this country, and do not think of marrying her. A great many Rajas and Rajas' sons have come here to marry her, and her father has had them all killed. He says whoever wishes to marry his daughter must first do whatever he bids him. If he can, then he shall marry the princess; if he cannot, the king will have him killed. But no one can do the things the king tells him to do; so all the Rajas and Rajas' sons who have tried have been put to death. You will be killed too, if you try. Do go away."" But the prince would not listen to anything she said."
"The king sent for the prince to the old woman's house, and his servants brought the Raja's son to the king's court-house to the king."
"There the king gave him eighty pounds of mustard seed, and told him to crush all the oil out of it that day, and bring it next morning to him to the court-house. ""Whoever wishes to marry my daughter,"" he said to the prince, ""must first do all I tell him. If he cannot, then I have him killed. So if you cannot crush all the oil out of this mustard seed, you will die."""
"The prince was very sorry when he heard this. ""How can I crush the oil out of all this mustard seed in one day?"" he said to himself; ""and if I do not, the king will kill me."" He took the mustard seed to the old woman's house, and did not know what to do. At last he remembered the Ant-Raja, and the moment he did so, the Ant-Raja and his ants came to him. ""Why do you look so sad?"" said the Ant-Raja."
"The prince showed him the mustard seed, and said to him, ""How can I crush the oil out of all this mustard seed in one day? And if I do not take the oil to the king to-morrow morning, he will kill me."""
"""Be happy,"" said the Ant-Raja; ""lie down and sleep; we will crush all the oil out for you during the day, and to-morrow morning you shall take it to the king."" The Raja's son lay down and slept, and the ants crushed out the oil for him. The prince was very glad when he saw the oil."
"The next morning he took it to the court-house to the king. But the king said, ""You cannot yet marry my daughter. If you wish to do so, you must first fight with my two demons and kill them."" The king a long time ago had caught two demons, and then, as he did not know what to do with them, he had shut them up in a cage. He was afraid to let them loose for fear they would eat up all the people in his country; and he did not know how to kill them. So all the kings and kings' sons who wanted to marry the Princess Labam had to fight with these demons; ""for,"" said the king to himself, ""perhaps the demons may be killed, and then I shall be rid of them."""
"When he heard of the demons the Raja's son was very sad. ""What can I do?"" he said to himself. ""How can I fight with these two demons?"" Then he thought of his tiger: and the tiger and his wife came to him and said, ""Why are you so sad?"" The Raja's son answered, ""The king has ordered me to fight with his two demons and kill them. How can I do this?"" ""Do not be frightened,"" said the tiger. ""Be happy. I and my wife will fight with them for you."""
"Then the Raja's son took out of his bag two splendid coats. They were all gold and silver, and covered with pearls and diamonds. These he put on the tigers to make them beautiful, and he took them to the king, and said to him, ""May these tigers fight your demons for me?"""
"""Yes,"" said the king, who did not care in the least who killed his demons, provided they were killed. ""Then call your demons,"" said the Raja's son, ""and these tigers will fight them."" The king did so, and the tigers and the demons fought and fought until the tigers had killed the demons."
"""That is good,"" said the king. ""But you must do something else before I give you my daughter. Up in the sky I have a kettle-drum. You must go and beat it. If you cannot do this, I will kill you."""
"The Raja's son thought of his little bed; so he went to the old woman's house and sat on his bed. ""Little bed,"" he said, ""up in the sky is the king's kettle-drum. I want to go to it."" The bed flew up with him, and the Raja's son beat the drum, and the king heard him."
"Still, when he came down, the king would not give him his daughter."
"""You have,"" he said to the prince, ""done the three things I told you to do; but you must do one thing more."" ""If I can, I will,"" said the Raja's son."
"Then the king showed him the trunk of a tree that was lying near his court-house. It was a very, very thick trunk. He gave the prince a wax hatchet, and said, ""To-morrow morning you must cut this trunk in two with this wax hatchet."""
"The Raja's son went back to the old woman's house. He was very sad, and thought that now the Raja would certainly kill him. ""I had his oil crushed out by the ants,"" he said to himself. ""I had his demons killed by the tigers. My bed helped me to beat his kettle-drum. But now what can I do? How can I cut that thick tree-trunk in two with a wax hatchet?"""
"At night he went on his bed to see the princess. ""To-morrow,"" he said to her, ""your father will kill me."" ""Why?"" asked the princess."
"""He has told me to cut a thick tree-trunk in two with a wax hatchet."
"How can I ever do that?"" said the Raja's son. ""Do not be afraid,"" said the princess; ""do as I bid you, and you will cut it in two quite easily."""
"Then she pulled out a hair from her head, and gave it to the prince."
"""To-morrow,"" she said, ""when no one is near you, you must say to the tree-trunk, 'The Princess Labam commands you to let yourself be cut in two by this hair.' Then stretch the hair down the edge of the wax hatchet's blade."""
"""And your ruby clasps."""
And the Queen undid the clasps.
"""Now the lilies from your breast."""
The Queen gathered together the lilies.
"""And the diamonds of your little bright shoe buckles."""
The Queen pulled off her shoes.
"Then the witch stirred the stuff that was in the cauldron, and, one by one, she threw in the gold crown and the sapphire necklace and the pearl bracelets and the ruby clasps and the diamonds of the little bright shoe buckles, and last of all she threw in the lilies."
"The stuff in the cauldron boiled up in foaming flashes of yellow and blue and red and white and silver, and sent out a sweet scent, and presently the witch poured it out into a pot and set it to cool in the doorway among the snakes."
"Then she said to the Queen: ""Your child will have hair as golden as your crown, eyes as blue as your sapphires. The red of your rubies will lie on its lips, and its skin will be clear and pale as your pearls. Its soul will be white and sweet as your lilies, and your diamonds will be no clearer than its wits."""
"""Oh, thank you, thank you,"" said the Queen, ""and when will it come?"""
"""You will find it when you get home."""
"""And won't you have something for yourself?"" asked the Queen. ""Any little thing you fancy would you like a country, or a sack of jewels?"""
"""Nothing, thank you,"" said the witch. ""I could make more diamonds in a day than I should wear in a year."""
"""Well, but do let me do some little thing for you,"" the Queen went on."
"""Aren't you tired of being a witch? Wouldn't you like to be a Duchess or a Princess, or something like that?"""
"""There is one thing I should rather like,"" said the witch, ""but it's hard to get in my trade."""
"""Oh, tell me what,"" said the Queen."
"""I should like some one to love me,"" said the witch."
"Then the Queen threw her arms around the witch's neck and kissed her half a hundred times. ""Why,"" she said, ""I love you better than my life!"
"You've given me the baby and the baby shall love you too."""
"""Perhaps it will,"" said the witch, ""and when the sorrow comes, send for me. Each of your fifty kisses will be a spell to bring me to you. Now, drink up your medicine, there's a dear, and run along home."""
"So the Queen drank the stuff in the pot, which was quite cool by this time, and she went out under the fringe of snakes, and they all behaved like good Sunday-school children. Some of them even tried to drop a curtsy to her as she went by, though that is not easy when you are hanging wrong way up by your tail. But the snakes knew the Queen was friends with their mistress; so, of course, they had to do their best to be civil."
"When the Queen got home, sure enough there was the baby lying in the cradle with the Royal arms blazoned on it, crying as naturally as possible. It had pink ribbons to tie up its sleeves, so the Queen saw at once it was a girl. When the King knew this he tore his black hair with fury."
"""Oh, you silly, silly Queen!"" he said. ""Why didn't I marry a clever lady? Did you think I went to all the trouble and expense of sending you to a witch to get a girl? You knew well enough it was a boy I wanted a boy, an heir, a Prince to learn all my magic and my enchantments, and to rule the kingdom after me. I'll bet a crown my crown,"" he said, ""you never even thought to tell the witch what kind you wanted! Did you now?"""
And the Queen hung her head and had to confess that she had only asked for a child.
"""Very well, madam,"" said the King, ""very well have your own way. And make the most of your daughter, while she is a child."""
"The Queen did. All the years of her life had never held half so much happiness as now lived in each of the moments when she held her little baby in her arms. And the years went on, and the King grew more and more clever at magic, and more and more disagreeable at home, and the Princess grew more beautiful and more dear every day she lived."
"The Queen and the Princess were feeding the goldfish in the courtyard fountains with crumbs of the Princess's eighteenth birthday cake, when the King came into the courtyard, looking as black as thunder, with his black raven hopping after him. He shook his fist at his family, as indeed he generally did whenever he met them, for he was not a King with pretty home manners. The raven sat down on the edge of the marble basin and tried to peck the goldfish. It was all he could do to show that he was in the same temper as his master."
"""A girl indeed!"" said the King angrily. ""I wonder you can dare to look me in the face, when you remember how your silliness has spoiled everything."""
"""You oughtn't to speak to my mother like that,"" said the Princess. She was eighteen, and it came to her suddenly and all in a moment that she was a grown-up, so she spoke out."
The King could not utter a word for several minutes. He was too angry.
"But the Queen said, ""My dear child, don't interfere,"" quite crossly, for she was frightened."
"""You could certainly do with a rivet or two, sir,"" said he. ""In fact, you want a good many."""
"""Well, get to work, then,"" said the dragon. ""You mend my wing, and then I'll go out and eat up all the town, and if you make a really smart job of it I'll eat you last. There!"""
"""I don't want to be eaten last, sir,"" said John."
"""Well then, I'll eat you first,"" said the dragon."
"""I don't want that, sir, either,"" said John."
"""Go on with you, you silly man,"" said the dragon, ""you don't know your own silly mind. Come, set to work."""
"""I don't like the job, sir,"" said John, ""and that's the truth. I know how easily accidents happen. It's all fair and smooth, and 'Please rivet me, and I'll eat you last' and then you get to work and you give a gentleman a bit of a nip or a dig under his rivets and then it's fire and smoke, and no apologies will meet the case."""
"""Upon my word of honor as a dragon,"" said the other."
"""I know you wouldn't do it on purpose, sir,"" said John, ""but any gentleman will give a jump and a sniff if he's nipped, and one of your sniffs would be enough for me. Now, if you'd just let me fasten you up?"""
"""It would be so undignified,"" objected the dragon."
"""We always fasten a horse up,"" said John, ""and he's the 'noble animal.'"""
"""It's all very well,"" said the dragon, ""but how do I know you'd untie me again when you'd riveted me? Give me something in pledge. What do you value most?"""
"""My hammer,"" said John. ""A blacksmith is nothing without a hammer."""
"""But you'd want that for riveting me. You must think of something else, and at once, or I'll eat you first."""
"At this moment the baby in the room above began to scream. Its mother had been so quiet that it thought she had settled down for the night, and that it was time to begin."
"""Whatever's that?"" said the dragon, starting so that every plate on his body rattled."
"""It's only the baby,"" said John."
"""What's that?"" asked the dragon. ""Something you value?"""
"""Well, yes, sir, rather,"" said the blacksmith."
"""Then bring it here,"" said the dragon, ""and I'll take care of it till you've done riveting me, and you shall tie me up."""
"""All right, sir,"" said John, ""but I ought to warn you. Babies are poison to dragons, so I don't deceive you. It's all right to touch but don't you go putting it into your mouth. I shouldn't like to see any harm come to a nice-looking gentleman like you."""
"The dragon purred at this compliment and said: ""All right, I'll be careful. Now go and fetch the thing, whatever it is."""
"So John ran up the steps as quickly as he could, for he knew that if the dragon got impatient before it was fastened, it could heave up the roof of the dungeon with one heave of its back, and kill them all in the ruins. His wife was asleep, in spite of the baby's cries; and John picked up the baby and took it down and put it between the dragon's front paws."
"""You just purr to it, sir,"" he said, ""and it'll be as good as gold."""
"So the dragon purred, and his purring pleased the baby so much that it stopped crying."
"Then John rummaged among the heap of old iron and found there some heavy chains and a great collar that had been made in the days when men sang over their work and put their hearts into it, so that the things they made were strong enough to bear the weight of a thousand years, let alone a dragon."
"John fastened the dragon up with the collar and the chains, and when he had padlocked them all on safely he set to work to find out how many rivets would be needed."
"""Six, eight, ten twenty, forty,"" said he. ""I haven't half enough rivets in the shop. If you'll excuse me, sir, I'll step around to another forge and get a few dozen. I won't be a minute."""
"And off he went, leaving the baby between the dragon's fore-paws, laughing and crowing with pleasure at the very large purr of it."
"John ran as hard as he could into the town, and found the mayor and corporation."
"""There's a dragon in my dungeon,"" he said; ""I've chained him up. Now come and help to get my baby away."""
"Well, in she came."
"""Can you wash this shirt clean, lassie you?"" said he."
"""I don't know,"" she said, ""but I think I can."""
"And almost before she had taken it and dipped it in the water, it was as white as driven snow, and whiter still."
"""Yes; you are the lassie for me,"" said the Prince."
"At that the old hag flew into such a rage, she burst on the spot, and the Princess with the long nose after her, and the whole pack of Trolls after her at least I've never heard a word about them since."
"As for the Prince and Princess, they set free all the poor Christian folk who had been carried off and shut up there; and they took with them all the silver and gold, and flitted away as far as they could from the Castle that lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon."
THE BLUE BELT
"Once on a time there was an old beggar-woman, who had gone out to beg."
"She had a little lad with her, and when she had got her bag full she struck across the hills towards her own home. So when they had gone a bit up the hill-side, they came upon a little Blue Belt which lay where two paths met, and the lad asked his mother's leave to pick it up."
"""No,"" said she, ""maybe there's witchcraft in it;"" and so with threats she forced him to follow her. But when they had gone a bit further, the lad said he must turn aside a moment out of the road; and meanwhile his mother sat down on a tree-stump. But the lad was a long time gone, for as soon as he got so far into the wood that the old dame could not see him, he ran off to where the Belt lay, took it up, tied it round his waist, and lo! he felt as strong as if he could lift the whole hill. When he got back, the old dame was in a great rage, and wanted to know what he had been doing all that while. ""You don't care how much time you waste, and yet you know the night is drawing on, and we must cross the hill before it is dark!"" So on they tramped; but when they had got about half-way, the old dame grew weary, and said she must rest under a bush."
"""Dear mother,"" said the lad, ""mayn't I just go up to the top of this high crag while you rest, and try if I can't see some sign of folk hereabouts?"""
Yes! he might do that; so when he had got to the top he saw a light shining from the north. So he ran down and told his mother.
"""We must get on, mother; we are near a house, for I see a bright light shining quite close to us in the north."" Then she rose and shouldered her bag, and set off to see; but they hadn't gone far, before there stood a steep spur of the hill, right across their path."
"""Just as I thought!"" said the old dame, ""now we can't go a step farther; a pretty bed we shall have here!"""
"But the lad took the bag under one arm, and his mother under the other, and ran straight up the steep crag with them."
"""Now, don't you see? Don't you see that we are close to a house? Don't you see that bright light?"""
"But the old dame said those were no Christian folk, but Trolls, for she was at home in all that forest far and near, and knew there was not a living soul in it, until you were well over the ridge and had come down on the other side. But they went on, and in a little while they came to a great house which was all painted red."
"""What's the good?"" said the old dame. ""We daren't go in, for here the Trolls live."""
"""Don't say so; we must go in. There must be men where the lights shine so,"" said the lad. So in he went, and his mother after him, but he had scarce opened the door before she swooned away, for there she saw a great stout man, at least twenty feet high, sitting on the bench."
"""Good evening, grandfather!"" said the lad."
"""Well, here I've sat three hundred years,"" said the man who sat on the bench, ""and no one has ever come and called me grandfather before."""
"Then the lad sat down by the man's side, and began to talk to him as if they had been old friends."
"""But what's come over your mother?"" said the man, after they had chatted a while. ""I think she swooned away; you had better look after her."""
"So the lad went and took hold of the old dame, and dragged her up the hall along the floor. That brought her to herself, and she kicked and scratched, and flung herself about, and at last sat down upon a heap of firewood in the corner; but she was so frightened that she scarce dared to look one in the face."
"After a while, the lad asked if they could spend the night there."
"""Yes, to be sure,"" said the man."
"So they went on talking again, but the lad soon got hungry, and wanted to know if they could get food as well as lodging."
"""Of course,"" said the man, ""that might be got too."" And after he had sat a while longer, he rose up and threw six loads of dry pitch-pine on the fire. This made the old hag still more afraid."
"""Oh! now he's going to roast us alive,"" she said, in the corner where she sat."
"And when the wood had burned down to glowing embers, up got the man and strode out of his house."

PAYNTER withdraws.
SIR CHARLES.  Hullo!  Where are they?  H'm!
"As he speaks, GEORGE re-enters."
"LADY DEDMOND.  [Kissing her son]  Well, George.  Where's Clare?"
GEORGE.  Afraid she's late.
LADY DEDMOND.  Are we early?
"GEORGE.  As a matter of fact, she's not in."
LADY DEDMOND.  Oh?
SIR CHARLES.  H'm!  Not--not had a rumpus?
GEORGE.  Not particularly.  [With the first real sign of feeling]
What I can't stand is being made a fool of before other people.
Ordinary friction one can put up with.  But that----
SIR CHARLES.  Gone out on purpose?  What!
LADY DEDMOND.  What was the trouble?
GEORGE.  I told her this morning you were coming in to Bridge.
"Appears she'd asked that fellow Malise, for music."
"LADY DEDMOND.  Well, my dear!"
SIR CHARLES.  Ah!  George.  Good dinner?
GEORGE.  [Giving his hand to MALISE]  How are you?  Clare!  Mr.
MALISE!
CLARE.  [Smiling-in a clear voice with the faintest possible lisp]
"Yes, we met on the door-mat.  [Pause.]"
SIR CHARLES.  Deuce you did!  [An awkward pause.]
"LADY DEDMOND.  [Acidly]  Mr. Malise doesn't play Bridge, it appears."
Afraid we shall be rather in the way of music.
SIR CHARLES.  What!  Aren't we goin' to get a game?  [PAYNTER has
entered with a tray.]
GEORGE.  Paynter!  Take that table into the dining room.
"PAYNTER.  [Putting down the tray on a table behind the door]  Yes,"
sir.
MALISE.  Let me give you a hand.
"PAYNTER and MALISE carry one of the Bridge tables out, GEORGE"
making a half-hearted attempt to relieve MALISE.
SIR CHARLES.  Very fine sunset!

"in which Creon bids Ismene speak no more of Antigone as ἥδε, and an"
ironical stress might well be laid by Creon on the word τούσδε as he
"uses it, which would suggest to his audience its antithesis τοὺς ἐκεὶ"
γάμους.
[1379] Soph. _Antig._ 804-5.
[1380] _ibid._ 810-16.
LADY DEDMOND.  Well! it would be better for you and Clare to be
"supposed to be out together, than for her to be out alone.  Go"
quietly into the dining-room and wait for her.
SIR CHARLES.  Good!  Leave your mother to make up something.  She'll
do it!
LADY DEDMOND.  That may be he.  Quick!
[A bell sounds.]
"GEORGE goes out into the hall, leaving the door open in his"
"haste.  LADY DEDMOND, following, calls ""Paynter!""  PAYNTER"
enters.
LADY DEDMOND.  Don't say anything about your master and mistress
being out.  I'll explain.
"PAYNTER.  The master, my lady?"
"LADY DEDMOND.  Yes, I know.  But you needn't say so.  Do you"
understand?
"PAYNTER.  [In polite dudgeon]  Just so, my lady."
[He goes out.]
SIR CHARLES.  By Jove!  That fellow smells a rat!
"LADY DEDMOND.  Be careful, Charles!"
LADY DEDMOND.  Without letting you know?
GEORGE.  I believe she did tell me.
LADY DEDMOND.  But surely----
GEORGE.  I don't want to discuss it.  There's never anything in
"particular.  We're all anyhow, as you know."
"LADY DEDMOND.  I see.  [She looks shrewdly at her son]  My dear,"
"I should be rather careful about him, I think."
SIR CHARLES.  Who's that?
LADY DEDMOND.  That Mr. Malise.
SIR CHARLES.  Oh!  That chap!
GEORGE.  Clare isn't that sort.
LADY DEDMOND.  I know.  But she catches up notions very easily.  I
think it's a great pity you ever came across him.
SIR CHARLES.  Where did you pick him up?
GEORGE.  Italy--this Spring--some place or other where they couldn't
speak English.
SIR CHARLES.  Um!  That's the worst of travellin'.
LADY DEDMOND.  I think you ought to have dropped him.  These literary
"people---[Quietly]  From exchanging ideas to something else, isn't"
"says: ""Clare!""  Receiving no answer, he goes in.  PAYNTER"
"switches up the electric light.  His face, turned towards the"
"curtained door, is apprehensive."
GEORGE.  [Re-entering]  Where's Mrs. Dedmond?
"PAYNTER.  I hardly know, sir."
GEORGE.  Dined in?
"PAYNTER.  She had a mere nothing at seven, sir."
"GEORGE.  Has she gone out, since?"
"PAYNTER.  Yes, sir--that is, yes.  The--er--mistress was not dressed"
"at all.  A little matter of fresh air, I think; sir."
GEORGE.  What time did my mother say they'd be here for Bridge?
PAYNTER.  Sir Charles and Lady Dedmond were coming at half-past nine;
"and Captain Huntingdon, too--Mr. and Mrs.  Fullarton might be a bit"
"late, sir."
GEORGE.  It's that now.  Your mistress said nothing?
"PAYNTER.  Not to me, sir."
GEORGE.  Send Burney.
"PAYNTER.  Very good, sir.  [He withdraws.]"
GEORGE stares gloomily at the card tables.  BURNEY comes in
"very far, George."
"SIR CHARLES.  We'll make him play Bridge.  Do him good, if he's that"
sort of fellow.
LADY DEDMOND.  Is anyone else coming?
"GEORGE.  Reggie Huntingdon, and the Fullartons."
"LADY DEDMOND.  [Softly]  You know, my dear boy, I've been meaning to"
speak to you for a long time.  It is such a pity you and Clare--What
is it?
"GEORGE.  God knows!  I try, and I believe she does."
"SIR CHARLES.  It's distressin'--for us, you know, my dear fellow--"
distressin'.
LADY DEDMOND.  I know it's been going on for a long time.
"GEORGE.  Oh!  leave it alone, mother."
"LADY DEDMOND.  But, George, I'm afraid this man has brought it to a"
point--put ideas into her head.
GEORGE.  You can't dislike him more than I do.  But there's nothing
one can object to.
"LADY DEDMOND.  Could Reggie Huntingdon do anything, now he's home?"
Brothers sometimes----
GEORGE.  I can't bear my affairs being messed about----
MALISE.  Such is my weakness.
LADY DEDMOND.  Delightful profession.
SIR CHARLES.  Doesn't tie you!  What!
MALISE.  Only by the head.
SIR CHARLES.  I'm always thinkin' of writin' my experiences.
MALISE.  Indeed!
[There is the sound of a door banged.]
"SIR CHARLES.  [Hastily]  You smoke, Mr.  MALISE?"
MALISE.  Too much.
SIR CHARLES.  Ah!  Must smoke when you think a lot.
MALISE.  Or think when you smoke a lot.
SIR CHARLES.  [Genially]  Don't know that I find that.
LADY DEDMOND.  [With her clear look at him]  Charles!
The door is opened.  CLARE DEDMOND in a cream-coloured evening
"frock comes in from the hall, followed by GEORGE.  She is rather"
"pale, of middle height, with a beautiful figure, wavy brown"
"hair, full, smiling lips, and large grey mesmeric eyes, one of"
"those women all vibration, iced over with a trained stoicism of"
voice and manner.
GEORGE.  There are things one does not do.
CLARE.  I came in because I was sorry.
GEORGE.  And at once began to do it again!  It seems to me you
delight in rows.
CLARE.  You'd miss your--reconciliations.
"GEORGE.  For God's sake, Clare, drop cynicism!"
CLARE.  And truth?
"GEORGE.  You are my wife, I suppose."
CLARE.  And they twain shall be one--spirit.
GEORGE.  Don't talk wild nonsense!
[There is silence.]
CLARE.  [Softly]  I don't give satisfaction.  Please give me notice!
GEORGE.  Pish!
"CLARE.  Five years, and four of them like this!  I'm sure we've"
served our time.  Don't you really think we might get on better
together--if I went away?
"GEORGE.  I've told you I won't stand a separation for no real reason,"
and have your name bandied about all over London.  I have some
primitive sense of honour.
"CLARE.  You mean your name, don't you?"
GEORGE.  Look here.  Did that fellow Malise put all this into your
head?
CLARE.  No; my own evil nature.
GEORGE.  I wish the deuce we'd never met him.  Comes of picking up
people you know nothing of.  I distrust him--and his looks--and his
infernal satiric way.  He can't even 'dress decently.  He's not--good
form.
CLARE.  [With a touch of rapture]  Ah-h!
GEORGE.  Why do you let him come?  What d'you find interesting in
him?
CLARE.  A mind.
GEORGE.  Deuced funny one!  To have a mind--as you call it--it's not
necessary to talk about Art and Literature.
CLARE.  We don't.
GEORGE.  Then what do you talk about--your minds?  [CLARE looks at
him]  Will you answer a straight question?  Is he falling in love
with you?
CLARE.  You had better ask him.

1. Definition of a Hymn.
"St. Augustine, 354-430, gave a definition of a hymn, which has been"
widely accepted:
A hymn is the praise of God by singing. A hymn is a song embodying the
praise of God. If there is merely praise but not praise of God it is
"not a hymn. If there be praise, and praise of God, but not sung, it is"
"not a hymn. For it to be a hymn, it is needful, therefore, for it to"
"have three things—praise, praise of God, and these sung."
"A recent definition, accepted by the Hymn Society of America, is that of"
the late Carl F. Price:
"surprise, then with offence, then almost with horror.  GEORGE is"
"about to go up to her, but HUNTINGDON heads him off."
"HUNTINGDON.  Bring the tray along, old man."
"GEORGE takes up the tray, stops to look at CLARE, then allows"
HUNTINGDON to shepherd him out.
"LADY DEDMOND.  [Without looking at CLARE]  Well, if we're going to"
"play, Charles? [She jerks his sleeve.]"
SIR CHARLES.  What?  [He marches out.]
LADY DEDMOND.  [Meeting MALISE in the doorway]  Now you will be able
to have your music.
[She follows the GENERAL out]
"[CLARE stands perfectly still, with her eyes closed.]"
MALISE.  Delicious!
"CLARE.  [In her level, clipped voice]  Perfectly beastly of me!  I'm"
so sorry.  I simply can't help running amok to-night.
MALISE.  Never apologize for being fey.  It's much too rare.
CLARE.  On the door-mat!  And they'd whitewashed me so beautifully!
Poor dears!  I wonder if I ought----[She looks towards the door.]
MALISE.  Don't spoil it!
"CLARE.  No, thank you."
"PAYNTER.  No, ma'am.  Good-night, ma'am."
[He withdraws.]
GEORGE.  You needn't have gone out of your way to tell a lie that
wouldn't deceive a guinea-pig.  [Going up to her]  Pleased with
yourself to-night?  [CLARE shakes her head]  Before that fellow
MALISE; as if our own people weren't enough!
"CLARE.  Is it worth while to rag me?  I know I've behaved badly, but"
"I couldn't help it, really!"
GEORGE.  Couldn't help behaving like a shop-girl?  My God!  You were
brought up as well as I was.
CLARE.  Alas!
GEORGE.  To let everybody see that we don't get on--there's only one
word for it--Disgusting!
CLARE.  I know.
GEORGE.  Then why do you do it?  I've always kept my end up.  Why in
heaven's name do you behave in this crazy way?
CLARE.  I'm sorry.
GEORGE.  [With intense feeling]  You like making a fool of me!
CLARE.  No--Really!  Only--I must break out sometimes.
"""How soon will you be leaving?"" she asked."
"""The wound was superficial. I really didn't need to be hospitalized. I'm"
"being released tomorrow morning. I'll probably leave immediately."""
"""You'll make a fine doctor, Frank."""
"""Thank you, I'll try."""
"""Good-bye, Frank."""
"""Good-bye--darling."""
She turned and fled.
"And judging by the deep sadness in his soul, he knew he had hit bottom."
There was no place to go but up.
*       *       *       *       *
Brent Taber's phone rang.
"""Hello, Taber. Halliday here."""
"""How are you, Halliday."""
"""Tops, old man. Ragged by the stress of it all, of course, but tops."""
"Taber waited. Halliday waited. Seeing that he would get no help, he"
"said, ""By the way, that little ... misunderstanding we had, the Senator"
SIR CHARLES.  I'm fond of her.  Nothing she wants that she hasn't
"got, is there?"
HUNTINGDON.  Never heard her say so.
SIR CHARLES.  [Dimly]  I don't know whether old George is a bit too
matter of fact for her.  H'm?
[A short silence.]
LADY DEDMOND.  There's a Mr. Malise coming here to-night.  I forget
if you know him.
HUNTINGDON.  Yes.  Rather a thorough-bred mongrel.
LADY DEDMOND.  He's literary.  [With hesitation]  You--you don't
think he--puts--er--ideas into her head?
"HUNTINGDON.  I asked Greyman, the novelist, about him; seems he's a"
"bit of an Ishmaelite, even among those fellows.  Can't see Clare----"
"LADY DEDMOND.  No.  Only, the great thing is that she shouldn't be"
encouraged.  Listen!--It is her-coming in.  I can hear their voices.
Gone to her room.  What a blessing that man isn't here yet!  [The
"door bell rings] Tt!  There he is, I expect."
SIR CHARLES.  What are we goin' to say?
"HUNTINGDON.  Say they're dining out, and we're not to wait Bridge for"
them.
SIR CHARLES.  Good!

"""That's what we say,"" cried Hart.  ""Here, you chaps, he speaks"
"English."""
"""Hurrah!"" said the crowd."
"""I spike Engelish,"" nodded the stranger."
"""How'd you come 'ere?"" asked the eager chorus."
The Frenchman nodded.
"""Goddam!"" he said, smiling.  ""Ship!  Por'smout'--London!  I spick"

"[She holds up her bare arms, with a motion of flight.]"
"MALISE.  [Admiring her] Ah-h-h!  [Then, as she drops her arms"
suddenly]  Play me something.
CLARE.  [Going to the piano]  I'm awfully grateful to you.  You don't
make me feel just an attractive female.  I wanted somebody like that.
"[Letting her hands rest on the notes]  All the same, I'm glad not to"
be ugly.
MALISE.  Thank God for beauty!
PAYNTER.  [Opening the door]  Mr. and Mrs. Fullarton.
MALISE.  Who are they?
CLARE.  [Rising]  She's my chief pal.  He was in the Navy.
"She goes forward.  MRS.  FULLERTON is a rather tall woman, with"
"dark hair and a quick eye.  He, one of those clean-shaven naval"
"men of good presence who have retired from the sea, but not from"
their susceptibility.
"MRS. FULLARTON.  [Kissing CLARE, and taking in both MALISE and her"
husband's look at CLARE]  We've only come for a minute.
CLARE.  They're playing Bridge in the dining-room.  Mr. Malise
"doesn't play.  Mr. Malise--Mrs. Fullarton, Mr. Fullarton."
[They greet.]
"FULLARTON.  Most awfully jolly dress, Mrs. Dedmond."
"""I have not long to live,"" said Tyapa, quietly."
Once the teacher asked how he had learned to read.
"""In prison,"" answered Tyapa, shortly."
"""Have you been there?"""
"""I was there...."""
"""For what?"""
"""Just so....  It was a mistake....  But I brought the Bible out with me"
"from there.  A lady gave it to me....  It is good in prison, brother."""
"""Is that so?  And why?"""
"""It teaches one....  I learned to read there....  I also got this"
"book....  And all these you see, free...."""
"When the teacher appeared in the dosshouse, Tyapa had already lived"
"there for some time.  He looked long into the teacher's face, as if to"
discover what kind of a man he was.  Tyapa often listened to his
"conversation, and once, sitting down beside him, said:"
"""I see you are very learned.... Have you read the Bible?"""
"""I have read it...."""
"""I see; I see.... Can you remember it?"""
_THE MONK WITH THE RED NOSE_
The next day Cæsar was finishing dressing when the servant told him
that a gentleman was waiting for him.
“Who is it?” asked Cæsar.
“It’s a monk.”
"Cæsar went to the salon and there found a tall monk with an evil face,"
"a red nose, and a worn habit."
"Cæsar recalled having seen him, but didn’t know where."
“What can I do for you?” asked Cæsar.
"“I come from His Eminence, Cardinal Fort. I must speak with you.”"
“Let’s go into the dining-room. We shall be alone there.”
“It would be better to talk in your room.”
"“No, there is no one here. Besides, I have to eat breakfast. Will you"
join me?”
"“No, thanks,” said the monk."
Cæsar remembered having seen that face in the Altemps palace. He was
doubtless one of the domestic monks who had been with the Abbé Preciozi.
"MRS. FULLARTON.  Yes, lovely, Clare.  [FULLARTON abases eyes which"
"mechanically readjust themselves]  We can't stay for Bridge, my dear;"
"I just wanted to see you a minute, that's all.  [Seeing HUNTINGDON"
"coming in she speaks in a low voice to her husband]  Edward, I want"
"to speak to Clare.  How d'you do, Captain Huntingdon?"
MALISE.  I'll say good-night.
"He shakes hands with CLARE, bows to MRS. FULLARTON, and makes"
his way out.  HUNTINGDON and FULLERTON foregather in the
doorway.
"MRS. FULLARTON.  How are things, Clare?  [CLARE just moves her"
shoulders]  Have you done what I suggested?  Your room?
CLARE.  No.
MRS. FULLARTON.  Why not?
CLARE.  I don't want to torture him.  If I strike--I'll go clean.  I
expect I shall strike.
MRS. FULLARTON.  My dear!  You'll have the whole world against you.
"CLARE.  Even you won't back me, Dolly?"
"MRS. FULLARTON.  Of course I'll back you, all that's possible, but I"
can't invent things.
"CLARE.  You wouldn't let me come to you for a bit, till I could find"
my feet?
"LADY DEDMOND.  It's getting serious, Reginald.  I don't know what's"
to become of them.  You don't think the Rector--you don't think your
father would speak to Clare?
HUNTINGDON.  Afraid the Governor's hardly well enough.  He takes
anything of that sort to heart so--especially Clare.
SIR CHARLES.  Can't you put in a word yourself?
HUNTINGDON.  Don't know where the mischief lies.
SIR CHARLES.  I'm sure George doesn't gallop her on the road.  Very
"steady-goin' fellow, old George."
"HUNTINGDON.  Oh, yes; George is all right, sir."
LADY DEDMOND.  They ought to have had children.
HUNTINGDON.  Expect they're pretty glad now they haven't.  I really
"don't know what to say, ma'am."
"SIR CHARLES.  Saving your presence, you know, Reginald, I've often"
noticed parsons' daughters grow up queer.  Get too much morality and
rice puddin'.
LADY DEDMOND.  [With a clear look]  Charles!
SIR CHARLES.  What was she like when you were kids?
"HUNTINGDON.  Oh, all right.  Could be rather a little devil, of"
"course, when her monkey was up."
"The door is opened, and PAYNTER announces ""Mr. Kenneth Malise."""
"MALISE enters.  He is a tall man, about thirty-five, with a"
"strongly marked, dark, irregular, ironic face, and eyes which"
seem to have needles in their pupils.  His thick hair is rather
"untidy, and his dress clothes not too new."
LADY DEDMOND.  How do you do?  My son and daughter-in-law are so very
sorry.  They'll be here directly.
"[MALISE bows with a queer, curly smile.]"
"SIR CHARLES.  [Shaking hands] How d'you do, sir?"
"HUNTINGDON.  We've met, I think."
"He gives MALISE that peculiar smiling stare, which seems to warn"
the person bowed to of the sort of person he is.  MALISE'S eyes
sparkle.
LADY DEDMOND.  Clare will be so grieved.  One of those invitations
MALISE.  On the spur of the moment.
"SIR CHARLES.  You play Bridge, sir?"
MALISE.  Afraid not!
SIR CHARLES.  Don't mean that?  Then we shall have to wait for 'em.
"LADY DEDMOND.  I forget, Mr. Malise--you write, don't you?"
behold in the sun.
"""Not all, my lord!"""
"""Say on!"""
The anchoress had buried her face in her black mantle. Her voice was
husky with tears.
"""My lord, you seek one bereft of reason!"""
"""Mad!"""
"""Alas!"""
A great cry came from Francesco's lips.
"""My God! This, then, is the end!"""
CHAPTER IX
THE DAWN
An undefined melancholy overshadowed the world. Autumn breathed in the
"wind. The year, red-bosomed, was rushing to its doom."
"On the summit of a wood-crowned hill, rising like a pyramid above moor"
"and forest, stood two men silent under the shadows of an oak. In the"
discoveries had been made at Benham's lodgings.
"""Indeed, sir,"" said the man, ""I believe the Superintendent wished to see"
"you."""
"""Ah, I dare say,"" said Kilshaw. ""Tell him I'm here."""
"When he was ushered into the inner room, the Superintendent confirmed"
the officer's surmise.
"""I was going to send a message to ask you to step round, sir,"" he"
remarked.
"""Here I am, but don't be long. I don't want to miss the Premier's"
"speech."""
"""Mr. Medland speaking to-day?"""
"""Of course. It's a great day with us at the House."""
"""I think it looks like being a great day all round. Well, Mr. Kilshaw,"
"you told me you knew the deceased."""
"""Yes, I knew Benham."""
"""Benyon,"" corrected the Superintendent."
"""Yes, that was his real name,"" assented Kilshaw."
"""At his lodgings there was found a packet. That's the wrapper,"" and he"
handed a piece of brown paper to Kilshaw.
CLARE.  [Shaking her head]  Reggie lives on his pay.
"MRS. FULLARTON.  [With one of her quick looks]  That was Mr. Malise,"
then?
"FULLARTON.  [Coming towards them]  I say, Mrs. Dedmond, you wouldn't"
"sing me that little song you sang the other night,  [He hums]  ""If I"
"might be the falling bee and kiss thee all the day""?  Remember?"
"MRS. FULLARTON.  ""The falling dew,"" Edward.  We simply must go,"
Clare.  Good-night.  [She kisses her.]
FULLARTON.  [Taking half-cover between his wife and CLARE]  It suits
you down to the ground-that dress.
CLARE.  Good-night.
"HUNTINGDON sees them out.  Left alone CLARE clenches her hands,"
"moves swiftly across to the window, and stands looking out."
"HUNTINGDON.  [Returning]  Look here, Clare!"
"CLARE.  Well, Reggie?"
"HUNTINGDON.  This is working up for a mess, old girl.  You can't do"
this kind of thing with impunity.  No man'll put up with it.  If
"you've got anything against George, better tell me.  [CLARE shakes"
her head]  You ought to know I should stick by you.  What is it?
Come?
"CLARE.  Get married, and find out after a year that she's the wrong"
The boy answered boldly and stoutly:
"""I am a barefooted tramp ...."""
The Captain looked critically at him.  This youngster had long hair and
"a weak face, with prominent cheek-bones and a turned-up nose.  He was"
"dressed in a blue blouse without a waistband, and on his head he wore"
"the remains of a straw hat, while his feet were bare."
"""You are a fool!"" decided Aristid Kuvalda.  ""What are you knocking"
about here for?  You are of absolutely no use to us ...  Do you drink
"vodki? ...  No? ...  Well, then, can you steal?""  Again, ""No.""  ""Go"
"away, learn, and come back again when you know something, and are a man"
"..."""
The youngster smiled.
"""No.  I shall live with you."""
"""Why?"""
"""Just because ..."""
"""Oh you ... Meteor!"" said the Captain."
"""I will break his teeth for him,"" said Martyanoff."
"""And why?"" asked the youngster."
"""Just because...."""
"him at the top of the low steps, and said:"
"""I want to talk to you, Dad."""
"He gave her a quick look, selected his hat, and followed to the door.  In"
"the cab, he put his hand on hers and said:"
"""Now, my dear?"""
But all she could get out was:
"""I want to come back to you.  I can't go on there.  It's--it's--I've come"
"to an end."""
"His hand pressed hers tightly, as if he were trying to save her the need"
for saying more.  Gyp went on:
"""I must get baby; I'm terrified that he'll try to keep her, to get me"
"back."""
"""Is he at home?"""
"""I don't know.  I haven't told him that I'm going to leave him."""
Winton looked at his watch and asked:
"""Does the baby ever go out as late as this?"""
"""Yes; after tea.  It's cooler."""
"""I'll take this cab on, then.  You stay and get the room ready for her."
"Don't worry, and don't go out till I return."""
"""Maybe there isn't a seat."""
"""Wouldn't that be terrible?"""
"""Then we'll have to wait over."""
"""Why don't you go and see?"""
Five minutes later they were walking down the west tunnel to gate
twenty-six.
"Frank Corson grinned. ""Come on, woman, I'm going to take you across"
"state lines for immoral purposes."""
"""How wonderful,"" she breathed."
*       *       *       *       *
Brent Taber was human and his triumph had been a thing of satisfaction
to him--but only momentarily. Now it had a slightly sour taste.
Not that he was unhappy. He was content and almost relaxed as he sat in
Doctor Entman's patio and worked on a Scotch and soda.
"""A nice night,"" Entman said."
"""Beautiful. Those stars are about ready to fall into our laps."""
"""Menace out there? It seems unthinkable."""
"""Doesn't it?"""
"promise."""
His hand touched her foot through the soft eiderdown.  Gyp thought: 'Why
does he come and whine to me like this?  He has no dignity--none!'  And
she said:
"""How can you promise?  You have made the girl love you.  I saw her face."""
He drew his hand back.
"""You saw her?"""
"""Yes."""
"He was silent, staring at her.  Presently he began again:"
"""She is a little fool.  I do not care for the whole of her as much as I"
care for your one finger.  What does it matter what one does in that way
"if one does not care?  The soul, not the body, is faithful.  A man"
"satisfies appetite--it is nothing."""
Gyp said:
"""Perhaps not; but it is something when it makes others miserable."""
"""Has it made you miserable, my Gyp?"""
"His voice had a ring of hope.  She answered, startled:"
"""I?  No--her."""
"""Her?  Ho!  It is an experience for her--it is life.  It will do her no"
"go on when one was tired--tired of her--and wanting only Gyp, only his"
"own wife?  That was a funny thing!  And now, when, for an hour or two, he"
"had shaken free of worry, had been feeling happy--yes, happy--this fellow"
"must come, and stand there with his face of a sphinx!  And he said"
pettishly:
"""Well, Paul! sit down.  What troubles have you brought?"""
Rosek lit a cigarette but did not sit down.  He struck even Fiorsen by
his unsmiling pallor.
"""You had better look out for Mr. Wagge, Gustav; he came to me yesterday."
"He has no music in his soul."""
Fiorsen sat up.
"""Satan take Mr. Wagge!  What can he do?"""
"""I am not a lawyer, but I imagine he can be unpleasant--the girl is"
"young."""
"Fiorsen glared at him, and said:"
"""Why did you throw me that cursed girl?"""
"Rosek answered, a little too steadily:"
"""I did not, my friend."""
"""What!  You did.  What was your game?  You never do anything without a"
"game.  You know you did.  Come; what was your game?"""
LOVE’S DISGUISES.
LOVE IN SPRING.
"GOOD to be loved and to love for a little, and then"
"Well to forget, be forgotten, ere loving grow life!"
"Dear, you have loved me, but was I the man among men?"
"Sweet, I have loved you, but scarcely as mistress or wife."
"Message of Spring in the hearts of a man and a maid,"
Hearts on a holiday: ho! let us love: it is Spring.
"Joy in the birds of the air, in the buds of the glade,"
Joy in our hearts in the joy of the hours on the wing.
"Well, but to-morrow? To-morrow, good-bye: it is over."
"Scarcely with tears shall we part, with a smile who had met."
Tears? What is this? But I thought we were playing at lover.
Play-time is past. I am going. And you love me yet!
GIPSY LOVE.
"THE gipsy tents are on the down,"
The gipsy girls are here;
And it’s O to be off and away from the town
"""I don't know, Rhoda. I should know but I don't. I should have known"
what was wrong so I could have done something about it. It just went
"sour, I guess."""
She turned and walked to the window. He wondered if there were tears in
her eyes.
"""Good-bye, Rhoda."""
"""Good-bye, Frank. I'm sorry."""
"The door hadn't quite closed. Now, as Frank Corson turned, he found it"
open. A man stood there--a man in a blue suit with empty eyes.
Frank stared at the man for long seconds. His eyes went toward the
"window. Rhoda had turned. She was watching the man in the doorway,"
looking past Frank at the creature from somewhere in space who was
neither man nor machine. _But how--?_ Frank Corson asked himself the
question. _Good God! How had this thing come about?_
"""Not--not _him_,"" he finally exploded."
Rhoda was walking forward. The look of fevered excitement was in her
"eyes. ""Please leave, Frank."" She did not look at him as she spoke. She"
kept her eyes on the man in the blue suit.
"""Not him!"""
"""Please leave, Frank."""
But it was too late. The door had closed. The man was looking at Frank.
"""Sit down,"" he said."
dragged her with them up the ladder. Lav was at the side of the boat
tearing off his blouse.
"""Oh, Lav, what'll we do! What are you going to do now?"" cried Sidney."
"""It's so black,"" wailed Pola. ""I'm--sick!"""
"""I'm going to swim ashore. It's the only way. I don't know how long"
"this old tub'll stand a sea and the wind's rising. We got to get help."""
"""You shan't swim alone, Lavender Green. We'll _all_ swim. That's"
"nothing of a swim--"""
"""You can't! You forget--Pola."""
"Sidney wheeled in consternation. ""Pola's complex!"" The girl was"
"crouched, now, on the deck, an abject, wailing figure."
"""You go with Lav, Mart,"" said Sidney in a quiet voice. ""I'll stay with"
"Pola."""
"""What do you think I am? I guess I'll stay with her too!"""
"""But your grandmother--"""
"""Oh, gran'ma!"" Mart's voice choked. ""But she'd be the one to _tell_ me"
"to stay--"""
"""It's no use our all trying it,"" muttered Lav. ""I'll get there or I"
"won't get anywhere."""
"""Maybe it's too far for you to swim!"" Sidney was at Lavender's side,"
"""You like pleasure, I believe."""
Fiorsen said violently:
"""Look here: I have done with your friendship--you are no friend to me.  I"
"have never really known you, and I should not wish to.  It is finished."
"Leave me in peace."""
Rosek smiled.
"""My dear, that is all very well, but friendships are not finished like"
"that.  Moreover, you owe me a thousand pounds."""
"""Well, I will pay it.""  Rosek's eyebrows mounted.  ""I will.  Gyp will"
"lend it to me."""
"""Oh!  Is Gyp so fond of you as that?  I thought she only loved her"
"music-lessons."""
"Crouching forward with his knees drawn up, Fiorsen hissed out:"
"""Don't talk of Gyp!  Get out of this!  I will pay you your thousand"
"pounds."""
"Rosek, still smiling, answered:"
"""Gustav, don't be a fool!  With a violin to your shoulder, you are a man."
"Without--you are a child.  Lie quiet, my friend, and think of Mr. Wagge."
But you had better come and talk it over with me. Good-bye for the
"moment.  Calm yourself.""  And, flipping the ash off his cigarette on to"
"the tray by Fiorsen's elbow, he nodded and went."
"HUNTINGDON.  Well!  I don't know him.  He may be all right, but he's"
not our sort.  And you're too pretty to go on the tack of the New
Woman and that kind of thing--haven't been brought up to it.
"CLARE.  British home-made summer goods, light and attractive--don't"
wear long.  [At the sound of voices in the hall]  They seem 'to be
"going, Reggie."
"[HUNTINGDON looks at her, vexed, unhappy.]"
"HUNTINGDON.  Don't head for trouble, old girl.  Take a pull.  Bless"
you!  Good-night.
"CLARE kisses him, and when he has gone turns away from the door,"
"holding herself in, refusing to give rein to some outburst of"
"emotion.  Suddenly she sits down at the untouched Bridge table,"
"leaning her bare elbows on it and her chin on her hands, quite"
calm.  GEORGE is coming in.  PAYNTER follows him.
"CLARE.  Nothing more wanted, thank you, Paynter.  You can go home,"
and the maids can go to bed.
"PAYNTER.  We are much obliged, ma'am."
"CLARE.  I ran over a dog, and had to get it seen to."
"PAYNTER.  Naturally, ma'am!"
CLARE.  Good-night.
"PAYNTER.  I couldn't get you a little anything, ma'am?"
CLARE.  When every day and every night!--Oh!  I know it's my fault
"for having married him, but that doesn't help."
HUNTINGDON.  Look here!  It's not as if George wasn't quite a decent
chap.  And it's no use blinking things; you are absolutely dependent
on him.  At home they've got every bit as much as they can do to keep
going.
CLARE.  I know.
HUNTINGDON.  And you've got to think of the girls.  Any trouble would
be very beastly for them.  And the poor old Governor would feel it
awfully.
"CLARE.  If I didn't know all that, Reggie, I should have gone home"
long ago.
"HUNTINGDON.  Well, what's to be done?  If my pay would run to it--but"
it simply won't.
"CLARE.  Thanks, old boy, of course not."
HUNTINGDON.  Can't you try to see George's side of it a bit?
CLARE.  I do.  Oh!  don't let's talk about it.
"HUNTINGDON.  Well, my child, there's just one thing you won't go"
"sailing near the wind, will you?  I mean, there are fellows always on"

Frank Corson lay propped on two pillows in a private room of the Park
Hill Hospital. Rhoda Kane sat in a chair beside the bed. She was pale
and very beautiful. The fire was now gone from her body and the fever
from her eyes.
"""They say he wasn't human. They say he was an android."" She shuddered,"
"looked down quickly, then slowly raised her head."
"""Yes."""
"""I'll--I'll never understand. I get sick thinking about it. I'll just"
"never understand."""
"""He was human and yet not human. He had extraordinary powers that we"
"don't begin to understand, so that what happened to you is no disgrace."""
"""It's a terrible disgrace."""
"""It happened to me, too. When he told me to sit down I had to do it. I"
"was helpless."""
"""But you fought! You overcame it."""
"Frank Corson smiled wryly. ""No, I didn't. It was just that he'd had"
"little time to work on me. It was a single mental blow, so to speak,"
"that laid me out. Like one punch in the ring. Gradually, I came out of"
"it."""
"""A woman!"" chorused the group."
"""That's what I said."""
"""Where is she now?"""
"""I don't know. I didn't see her at all. I grappled with the first"
"person I ran into. She must have gone out as you came in."" Boyd"
"indicated the side door, which was still ajar."
"""It's a lie,"" screamed Marsh."
"""It's the truth,"" stoutly maintained Emerson, ""and there was a man with"
"her, too. Who was she, Marsh? Who was the man?"""
"""She--she--I don't know."""
"""Don't lie."""
"""I'm hurt,"" reiterated the stricken man, feebly. Then, seeing the"
"bewilderment in the faces about him, he burst out anew: ""Don't stand"
"there like a lot of fools. Why don't you get him?"""
"""If I stabbed him I must have had a knife,"" Emerson said, again"
"checking the forward movement. ""You may search me if you like. See?"" He"
opened his coat and displayed his belt.
"""He's got a six-shooter,"" some one said."
"""Yes, and I may use it,"" said Emerson, quietly."
"Inside, a shadow of concern moved like a quick cloud across her"
"beautiful face. ""You don't look well, Frank."""
"""I'm quite all right, really. Haven't been sleeping too well, but"
"there's been a lot on my mind."""
"""I've been hoping you'd phone."""
"""I wanted to but there didn't seem to be anything to say. Nothing except"
"that I'm sorry I let you down so miserably."""
"""Frank! You didn't. You really didn't. It was just that--oh, it's not"
"important any more."""
"""No. It's not important now."""
"""Would you like a drink?"""
"""Thanks, no. I've come to say good-bye."""
"""Good-bye?"""
"""Yes. I'm leaving Park Hill--leaving New York. I'm going into a small"
Minnesota hospital to finish my internship. Then I'll probably practice
"out there somewhere."""
Behind the new glitter of her eyes there was stark misery.
"""Frank--Frank--what went wrong with us?"""
The appeal was a labored whisper.
"""Only think, Alicia!"" she cried. ""Dick is on his way home, and with such"
"good news. We've just had a cable from him."""
"""Coming back!"""
"""Yes. He's engaged! He met the Grangers on their tour round the"
"world--you know them, the great cotton people?--at Sydney, and he's"
"engaged to the youngest girl, Violet--you remember her? It all happened"
in a fortnight. Mary and Lord Eynesford are delighted. It's just
"perfect. She's very pretty, and tremendously well off. I do declare, I"
never thought Dick would end so well! What a happy thought it was
"sending him away! Aren't you delighted?"""
"""It sounds very nice, doesn't it? I don't think I knew her more than"
"just to speak to."""
"""Dick'll be here in four days. I've been looking for you to tell you for"
"the last hour. Where have you been?"""
"""In the Park."""
"""Alone, as usual, you hermit?"""
"""Well, I met the Medlands and Mr. Norburn, and talked to them for a"
"little while."""
"""Alicia! But it's no use talking to you. Come and find Mary."""
"""No, Eleanor, I'm tired, and--and hot. I'll go to my room."""
"""Oh, you must come and see her first."""
"""Just a moment."""
"Crane waited. He waited for what seemed like ages, but a glance at his"
watch told him it had been less than five minutes. He disconnected and
dialed again.
"""This is Crane. We got cut off. I want to talk to Porter."""
"""I'm sorry but Mr. Porter has gone for the day."""
"""Well, where can I reach him? It's important."""
"""I'm sorry. Mr. Porter left no number."""
"""When will he be back?"""
"""He didn't say."""
"Crane slammed the phone down. ""The bastards!"" he snarled. ""The lousy,"
crummy bastards. Running like a pack of scared rats. Bureaucrats!
"Damned, cowardly, self-appointed opportunists!"""
He stopped cursing and sat for a while.
When he got up and left the office he looked and felt old but he had
faced a truth. It would not be necessary to campaign next year.
It wouldn't be of any use.
"'None that can help you,' he replied; 'some that you can help.'"
"She started and looked at him wildly, her lips apart, her eyes wide"
"with hope, fear, expectation. What did he mean? What could he mean by"
this new turn? Ha!
"She had her face towards the window, and dark as the room was"
growing--outside the light was failing fast--he read the thought in
"her eyes, and nodded."
"'The Waldgrave?' he said lightly. 'Yes, he is alive, Countess, at"
present; and your steward also.'
"'They are prisoners?' she whispered, her cheeks grown white."
'Prisoners; and under sentence of death.'
'Where?'
'In my camp.'
'Why?' she muttered. But alas! she knew; she knew already.
"'They are hostages for your good behaviour,' he answered in his cold,"
"mocking tone. 'If their principal satisfies me, good; they will go"
"free. If not, they die--to-morrow.'"
'To-morrow?' she gasped.
"'To-morrow,' he answered ruthlessly. 'Now I think we understand one"
another.'
"""Nearly everything here is mine."""
Rosek shook his head.
"""The lease is in his name--you are his wife.  They can do it, I assure"
"you.""  A sort of shadow passed over his face, and he added: ""I cannot"
"help him any more--just now."""
Gyp shook her head quickly.
"""No--of course!  You ought not to have helped him at all.  I can't"
"bear--""  He bowed, and she stopped, ashamed.  ""How much does he owe"
"altogether?"""
"""About thirteen hundred pounds.  It isn't much, of course.  But there is"
"something else--"""
"""Worse?"""
Rosek nodded.
"""I am afraid to tell you; you will think again perhaps that I am trying"
"to make capital out of it.  I can read your thoughts, you see.  I cannot"
"afford that you should think that, this time."""
Gyp made a little movement as though putting away his words.
"""No; tell me, please."""
Rosek shrugged his shoulders.
"""There is a man called Wagge, an undertaker--the father of someone you"

As concerning my friend is anything amiss?
"_C. Custance._ No, not on my part; but here was Sim. Suresby--"
"_T. Trusty._ He was with me, and told me so."
_C. Custance._ And he stood by
"While Ralph Roister Doister, with help of Merrygreek,"
For promise of marriage did unto me seek.
_T. Trusty._ And had ye made any promise before them twain?
"_C. Custance._ No, I had rather be torn in pieces and slain."
"No man hath my faith and troth but Gawin Goodluck,"
"And that before Suresby did I say, and there stuck;"
But of certain letters there were such words spoken--
_T. Trusty._ He told me that too.
"_C. Custance._ And of a ring and token,"
"That Suresby, I spied, did more than half suspect"
That I my faith to Gawin Goodluck did reject.
"_T. Trusty._ But was there no such matter, Dame Custance, indeed?"
"_C. Custance._ If ever my head thought it, God send me ill speed!"

And very soon the French and English skippers were talking to each
"other at the rate of knots, while Hart sat in a crowd of Frenchmen"
and told them all about everything.
It was close on sundown when Jones returned to the _Potluck_.  He had
to be helped up the side by some of the crew.
"""Ain't we under arrest?"" they asked.  ""Does we dare come out?"""
Jones hiccupped.
"""I releases you on your own recognition,"" he said.  ""So down you come"
"and 'elp."""
"When he put his foot on the deck, he mustered all hands aft."
"""And you, Lampert, and you, Simcox!"""
The two mates came out of their cabins.
"""And where's Hart?"""
"""If you please, sir, he's drunk,"" said Billy."
"""Arrest 'im,"" said the skipper; ""what's 'e mean by it?  Now, look"
"'ere, you bally lot, what does you think of yourselves?"""
The crew appeared uneasy.

and pistol in his girdle and a white shoulder sash.
'Herr Krapp?' I said.
"'The same,' he answered, eying me gravely."
"'I am the Countess of Heritzburg's steward,' I said. I began to see"
the need of explanation. 'Doubtless you have heard that she is in the
city?'
"'Certainly,' he answered. 'In the Ritter Strasse.'"
"'Yes,' I replied. 'A fortnight ago she missed a young woman, one of"
"her attendants. She was lost in a night adventure,' I continued, my"
throat dry and husky. 'A few minutes ago I saw her looking from one of
your windows.'
'From one of my windows?' he exclaimed in a tone of surprise.
"'Yes,' I said stiffly."
He opened his eyes wide. 'Here?' he said. He pointed to his house.
I nodded.
"'Impossible!' he replied, shutting his lips suddenly. 'Quite"
"impossible, my friend. My household consists of my two sons and"
"myself. We have a housekeeper only, and two lads. I have no young"
women in the house.'
"'Yet I saw her face, Herr Krapp, at your window,' I answered"
"""Play me the 'Carnival,'"" he said.  ""We shall soon see!"""
"Gyp played.  Twice he nodded; once he tapped his fingers on his teeth,"
"and showed her the whites of his eyes--which meant: ""That will have to be"
"very different!""  And once he grunted.  When she had finished, he sat"
"down beside her, took her hand in his, and, examining the fingers, began:"
"""Yes, yes, soon again!  Spoiling yourself, playing for that fiddler!"
"Trop sympathique!  The back-bone, the back-bone--we shall improve that."
"Now, four hours a day for six weeks--and we shall have something again."""
Gyp said softly:
"""I have a baby, Monsieur Harmost."""
Monsieur Harmost bounded.
"""What!  That is a tragedy!""  Gyp shook her head.  ""You like it?  A baby!"
"Does it not squall?"""
"""Very little."""
"""Mon Dieu!  Well, well, you are still as beautiful as ever.  That is"
"something.  Now, what can you do with this baby?  Could you get rid of it"
"a little?  This is serious.  This is a talent in danger. A fiddler, and a"
"baby!  C'est beaucoup!  C'est trop!"""
"Gyp smiled.  And Monsieur Harmost, whose exterior covered much"
"sensibility, stroked her hand."
"""You have grown up, my little friend,"" he said gravely.  ""Never mind;"
"and rather looking on than taking part. 'What is it?' I said, shaking"
him roughly by the arm. 'What is the matter here?'
"'Hallo!' he answered, starting as he turned to me. 'Is it you again,"
my friend?'
I had hit on Herr Krapp!' Yes!' I cried breathlessly. 'What is it?
what is amiss?'
"He shrugged his shoulders. 'They are hanging a spy,' he answered."
"'Nothing more. Irregular, but wholesome.'"
I drew a deep breath. 'Is that all?' I said.
"He eyed me curiously. 'To be sure,' he said. 'What did you think it"
was?'
"'I feared that there might be something wrong at my lady's,' I said,"
beginning to get my breath again. 'I left her alone at sunset. And
when I saw this crowd before the house I--I could almost have cut off
"my hand. Thank God, I was mistaken!'"
"He looked at me again and seemed to reflect a moment. Then he said,"
'You have not found the young woman you were seeking?'
I shook my head.
"'Well, it occurred to me afterwards--but at which window did you see"
her?'
"'At a window on the first floor; the farthest from the door,' I"
answered.

The affair seemed to cause him intense amusement. A ray of light
appeared to Yvonne.
"“You won’t interfere with me at all, Amédée--not claim anything?”"
"“Oh, don’t be afraid. _Dès ce moment je vais me reflanquer au sapin!_ I"
shall be as dead as dead can be for you. _Suis pas méchant va!_”
"“Thank you,” said Yvonne. “You were always kind-hearted, Amédée--oh,"
it was a horrible mistake--it can’t be altered. You see that I am
helpless.”
"“Why, my child,” said he, seating himself again, “I keep on telling you"
it is a farce--like all the rest of life. I only laugh. And now let us
talk a little before I pop into the coffin again. What is the name of
the thrice happy being?”
"“Oh, don’t ask me, I beg you,” said Yvonne shivering. “It is all"
so painful. Tell me about yourself--your voice--Is it still in good
condition?”
“Never better. I am singing here this afternoon.”
“In the Kursaal?”
"“Why, yes. That’s why I am here. Oh, _ca marche--pas encore paralysée,"
celle-là_. Come and hear me. _Et ton petit organe à toi?_”
“I am out of practice. I have given up the profession.”

"Solem approached, and lifted his cap in greeting. Then he looked round"
"quickly and began to talk to the lawyer--politely, as became his position"
of a servant:
"""The Danish gentleman is going to climb the peak tomorrow. I'm to take a"
"rope and go with him."""
The lawyer was startled.
"""Is he--?"""
"The blankness of the lawyer's face was a remarkable sight. His small,"
athletic brain failed him. A moment passed in silence.
"""Yes, early tomorrow morning,"" said Solem. ""I thought I'd tell you."
"Because after all it was your idea first."""
"""Yes, so it was,"" said the lawyer. ""You're quite right. But now he'll be"
"ahead of me."""
Solem knew how to get round that.
"""No, I didn't promise to go,"" he said. ""I told him I had to go to the"
"village tomorrow."""
"""But we can't deceive him. I don't want to do that."""
"""Pity,"" said Solem. ""Everybody says the first one to climb the Blue Peak"
"will be in all the papers."""

"""What then?"""
"""I would follow you to the world's end!"""
"""As my wife?"""
"""As your wife!"""
"He held out his arms toward her, impulse rising like the sun high and"
splendid above the mists of distrust. It was an instant's
"forgetfulness, which passed as rapidly as it had come. His arms sank"
heavily to his side.
"""Have you thought what that means? If you go with me, you must leave"
"your people for ever."""
"""I would follow you gladly."""
He shook his head.
"""You do not understand. You must leave them now--now when I go against"
"them."""
"""No!"" she broke in roughly. ""You can't, Nehal, you can't. You have the"
right to be bitter and angry; you have not the right to commit a
crime. And it would be a crime. You are plunging thousands into
"bloodshed and ruin--"" He lifted his hand, and the expression in his"
eyes checked her.
"here.' And again she tried to shut the door, but I prevented her."
'Where is he?' I asked sternly.
"'He is at morning drill, if you must know,' she snapped; 'and his two"
"sons. Now, will you let me shut my door? Or must I cry out?'"
"'Nonsense, mother!' I said. 'Who is in the house besides yourself?'"
"'What is that to you?' she replied, breathing short."
"'I have told you,' I said, trying to control my anger. 'I----'"
"But, quick as lightning, the door slammed to and cut me short. I had"
thoughtlessly moved my foot. I heard the woman chuckle and go slipshod
"down the passage, and though I knocked again in a rage, the door"
remained closed.
"I fell back and looked at the house. An elderly man in a grave, sober"
"dress was passing, among others, and I caught his eye."
'Whose house is that?' I asked him.
"'Herr Krapp's,' he answered."
"'I am a stranger,' I said. 'Is he a man of substance?'"
The person I addressed smiled. 'He is a member of the Council of
"Safety,' he said dryly. 'His brother is prefect of this ward. But here"
is Herr Krapp. Doubtless he has been at St. Sebald's drilling.'
"I thanked him, and made but two steps to Herr Krapp's side. He was the"
"""Sure."" Norton grinned. ""I am that."" He disappeared down the ladder"
towards the generator room.
"Andrews turned to Alice. ""You're not going to go for that fancy"
"routine, are you?"" he demanded crossly."
"""What routine?"""
"""First he uses power for hot water, power that I was storing up. Now"
"he's going to pedal that thing to waste more power."""
"Alice shrugged. ""He's the spaceman,"" she said simply. ""If he thinks we"
"can spare the power for a bath, I could certainly use one."""
"""How can you trust the likes of him?"""
"""We've got to,"" she said. ""We've got to."""
"""I wouldn't,"" said Andrews. ""I can't."""
"She looked at her employer seriously. ""We've both got to trust him,"""
"she said quietly. ""Because, right or wrong, he is the only one who"
"knows anything about space and what's likely to happen next."""
"""At a hundred an hour,"" Andrews said for the ninetieth time or so,"
scathingly.
"Alice nodded soberly. ""But you mustn't forget that isn't going to do"
"him any good unless he gets us all home so that he can use it."""
"Reluctantly, Andrews nodded. ""I suppose you're right."""
"can have heard, that it would distress you to speak of."""
"She said nothing, but fixed her eyes on his."
"""I am right?"" he asked. ""It is about--my wife?"""
"She bowed her head. He stood silent for a moment, and she cried,"
"""It was only gossip--a woman's gossip; I did wrong to listen to it."""
"""Gossip,"" he said, ""is often true. This is true,"" and he set his lips."
"The worst often finds or makes people calm. She had flushed at first,"
"but the colour went again, and she said quietly,"
"""If you have time and don't mind, I should like to hear it all."""
"She had forgotten what this request must mean to him, or perhaps she"
"thought the time for pretence had gone by. If so, he understood, for he"
"answered,"
"""It's your right."""
"Her eyes sank to the ground, but she did not quarrel with his words. She"
stood motionless while he told his story. He spoke with wilful brevity
and dryness.
"""I was a young man when I met her. She was married, and I went to the"
"house. Her husband----"""
"""Did he ill-treat her?"""
"Frank Corson sat down. He saw the man and he saw Rhoda, but they seemed"
unimportant. Something had happened to his mind and he was busy
struggling with it. That was all that was important.
The strange lethargy that came like a cloud over his mind was beyond
understanding.

Captain Abrams looked into the closet and back at Brent Taber. His lips
"were back a little off his teeth. With Abrams, this indicated anger."
"""All right. What does Washington do about this one? Does Washington tell"
"us to be good little boys and go hand out parking tickets?"""
"""It wasn't like that,"" Taber said."
"""It doesn't much matter how it was. The thing is--how is it going to be"
"now?"""
"""You got a murder, friend. Plain and simple. What do the New York police"
"do when they get a murder?"""
"Abrams spoke bitterly. ""Sometimes they let a panel truck drive in and"
"haul the body away and that's that."""
"""Let's save the sarcasm until later. I called you in. It's your case."
"What do you want me to do?"""
"""Talk a little, maybe. The other one--now this one. The same killer?"""
"""Oh, I'm--I'm--sick!"" broke in Pola."
"""Sit up straight and talk and you won't think about it,"" commanded"
"Mart, so sternly that Pola straightened, her white face wan in the"
darkness.
"""I don't see how you _can_ talk when you're--may be--going--to die!"""
"""Well, talking helps you more than crying."""
"""But I--I don't _want_ to--die."""
"""Who does?"" retorted Mart roughly. Nevertheless, touched by Pola's"
"helplessness, she found Pola's hand and held it close in hers. ""But"
"let's face whatever happens with our heads up!"""
"""To the wind,"" breathed Sidney, shivering."
"""I--I just can't be brave like you two. I--I'm an awful coward. I can't"
help it. I've always been afraid to even try to swim. I'm afraid of
"lots of things. Oh, I'm afraid to--to--"""
Sidney caught Pola's other hand.
"""Don't say it, Pola. Maybe someone will find us. And probably you can't"
"help feeling afraid."""
Mart suddenly remembered the cookies she had brought. She found them
where she had hidden them at the back of one of the bunks.
"""Here, eat a cookie and you'll forget things. I'm hungry, aren't you,"
"too?"""
"sunny and carefree soul of yours?"""
"""Nobody! _Nobody!_"""
"""Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand--"""
"""I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me"
"Ford."""
"""Ford? _Ford?_ Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand...."""
After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few
"moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided"
"miserably. Besides, she was a girl."
"All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could"
help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to
"him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a"
little better.
"The door opened on the signal, ""Sesame."" When Butt saw somebody was"
"with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his"
fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.
"He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered"
his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump
when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.
"""An honor, Miss Sparling,"" he said in that rumbly voice. ""Please come"
"right in. There's a hurry-up draft."""
So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the

MRS. FULLARTON.  Of course--the only thing is that----
"CLARE.  [With a faint smile]  It's all right, Dolly.  I'm not coming."
"MRS. FULLARTON.  Oh!  don't do anything desperate, Clare--you are so"
desperate sometimes.  You ought to make terms--not tracks.
CLARE.  Haggle?  [She shakes her head]  What have I got to make terms

"MRS. FULLARTON.  But, Clare----"
"CLARE.  No, Dolly; even you don't understand.  All day and every day"
"--just as far apart as we can be--and still--Jolly, isn't it?  If"
you've got a soul at all.
"MRS. FULLARTON.  It's awful, really."
"CLARE.  I suppose there are lots of women who feel as I do, and go on"
"with it; only, you see, I happen to have something in me that--comes"
"to an end.  Can't endure beyond a certain time, ever."

bits.  It is the only sign of emotion she has given.

"Crane thing, I'm sure you realized that our talk was ... well, the words"
were put into my mouth. I felt the same way about the oaf as you did.
"But sometimes, in the line of duty, old man ... well, I know you were"
"reading between my lines all the time."""
"""I'm pretty good at that."""
"""I knew we understood each other."""
"""Is that what you called about?"""
"""Yes, but I've got a little tip for you. They want to see you upstairs."
I happen to know they liked the way things turned out. Just between you
"and me, the humiliation of Crane made certain high officials pretty"
"happy. I was queried and I gave you all the credit."""
"""Before or after the good Senator fell on his face?"""
"Halliday laughed. ""Okay, pal. You're entitled to your little dig. But"
"you know this--I'm with you and I always will be."""
"""And I'm with you, too, pal,"" Brent said wearily and hung up."
"The phone rang again. Automatically, Brent picked up the receiver."
"""Brent? Porter on this end. How is it with you, old man?"""

"Porter laughed. ""Just called to say, 'Good job well done.'"""
"""Thanks."""

individuality like herself!
The sound of footsteps on the gravel made her turn.  Rosek was coming
"from the drawing-room window.  Rather startled, Gyp looked at him over"
her shoulder.  What had brought him at eleven o'clock in the morning?  He
"came up to her, bowed, and said:"
"""I came to see Gustav.  He's not up yet, it seems.  I thought I would"
"speak to you first.  Can we talk?"""
"Hesitating just a second, Gyp drew off her gardening-gloves:"
"""Of course!  Here?  Or in the drawing-room?"""
Rosek answered:
"""In the drawing-room, please."""
"A faint tremor passed through her, but she led the way, and seated"
herself where she could see Betty and the baby.  Rosek stood looking down
"at her; his stillness, the sweetish gravity of his well-cut lips, his"
spotless dandyism stirred in Gyp a kind of unwilling admiration.
"""What is it?"" she said."
"""Bad business, I'm afraid.  Something must be done at once.  I have been"
"trying to arrange things, but they will not wait.  They are even"
"threatening to sell up this house."""
"With a sense of outrage, Gyp cried:"
"columns of smoke close together, and you ought to know what that means.”"
“Indian sign! Boy Scout sign! Means ‘Help is wanted’!” exclaimed Harry.
“We’ve got to go and see what it is.”
"“It may be Jimmie,” Jack suggested."
"“It’s either Jimmie or that messenger boy,” Frank said. “If it’s Jimmie,"
"he’s really in trouble, and if it’s the messenger boy, he’s doing it to"
get more of us into his clutches.”
"“Then we’d better go well armed and ready for any kind of a reception,”"
Jack advised. “No knowing what we’ll find.”
“What’ll we do with Gilroy?” asked Frank.
"“Aw, let him sleep,” advised Harry."
"“Sure, let him sleep,” Jack put in. “He’ll be all right ’till we get"
back. No one will molest the camp in daytime.”
"“Seems to me that we ought to leave someone here,” Frank said."
"“All right, you can stay if you want to!” Jack declared. “Harry and I"
are going down there to see what the trouble is about.”
"“Aw, come on, Frank!” Harry urged. “There won’t anything happen to"
"Gilroy! He may have a bad dream, but that’s about all.”"
“How far do you suppose that signal is from here?” asked Frank.
"“Not more than half a mile,” Harry explained."
"only fitting you should have an opportunity to see it first hand."""
"""Mind giving us a preview of the upcoming agenda?"" Vance leaned back."
"""We need to plan our day."""
"""Quite simply, I thought it was time you and I got reacquainted, Dr."
"Vance. It's been a long time."""
"""Eight years."""
"""Yes. Eight years . . ."" There was a pause. ""If you would excuse me a"
"moment, I must take a call."""
The speaker clicked off.
"""Michael, I've got a very bad feeling about all this."" She was rising"
"from the bath, her back to the camera. ""What do you think he's going to"
"do?"""
"He's going to kill us, Vance realized. After he's played with us a"
while. It's really quite simple.
"""I don't know,"" he lied."
"Then the speaker clicked on again. ""Please forgive me. There are so"
"many demands on my time. However, I was hoping you, Dr. Vance, would"
consent to join me this afternoon for tea. We have some urgent matters
"to discuss."""
"""I'll see if I can work it into my schedule."""
"""Given the hectic goings-on here at the moment, perhaps a quiet moment"
"""Awake, Alice?"" Norton asked brightly."
"""Awake again,"" she said unhappily. ""For.... What is it? The ninth day?"""
"""Eighth,"" he said. ""Can't go on much longer."""
"""I hope not."""
"""You look all in,"" he said softly. He sat down on the edge of the"
"divan, beside her, and put a gentle hand on her shoulder. ""Take it"
"easy, m'lady. They're really scouring space for us. We'll be all right."
"You'll see."""
*       *       *       *       *
Unexpectedly he bent and kissed her chastely on the forehead. Alice
"tensed at first, but relaxed almost immediately because the warmth of"
"that honest affection made her feel less alone and cold, in the depths"
"of uncharted space. Some of the worry and concern was erased, at least."
She stretched warmly as he rubbed her forehead with his cheek.
Then he sat up and looked down at her. He put his hand on her cheek
"gently and said, ""We'll be all right, kid."""
"""Eight days,"" she said in a hoarse whisper."
"He nodded solemnly. ""Every hour means they must be coming closer and"
"closer. Every lonely hour means that it can't be many more, because"
"they've covered all the places where we weren't. Follow me, Alice?"""
She shook her head unhappily.
CLARE.  I'd been walking up and down the Embankment for about three
hours.  One does get desperate sometimes.
MALISE.  Thank God for that!
CLARE.  Only makes it worse afterwards.  It seems so frightful to
"them, too."
"MALISE.  [Softly and suddenly, but with a difficulty in finding the"
right words]  Blessed be the respectable!  May they dream of--me!
And blessed be all men of the world!  May they perish of a surfeit
of--good form!
"CLARE.  I like that.  Oh, won't there be a row!  [With a faint"
movement of her shoulders]  And the usual reconciliation.
"MALISE.  Mrs. Dedmond, there's a whole world outside yours.  Why"
don't you spread your wings?
"CLARE.  My dear father's a saint, and he's getting old and frail; and"
I've got a sister engaged; and three little sisters to whom I'm
"supposed to set a good example.  Then, I've no money, and I can't do"
"anything for a living, except serve in a shop.  I shouldn't be free,"
"either; so what's the good?  Besides, I oughtn't to have married if I"
"wasn't going to be happy.  You see, I'm not a bit misunderstood or"
ill-treated.  It's only----
MALISE.  Prison.  Break out!
CLARE.  [Turning to the window]  Did you see the sunset?  That white
cloud trying to fly up?
_Far_ from the world.
_Far_ ...
_Far_ ***
"_Far_, *** B. F."
"_Far_ ..., J. B."
"_Farr_, John."
The arrangement of title-entries is first by the heading words; if
"they are the same, then by the next word; if that is the same,"
"by the next; and so on. Every word, articles and prepositions"
"included, is to be regarded, but not a transposed article: e.g.,"
_Uncovenanted_ Mercies.
_Under_ a Cloud.
_Under_ the Ban.
_Under_ the Greenwood Tree; a novel.
_Under_ the Greenwood Tree; a poem.
_Under_ Which King.
"_Undone_ Task, The."
_Undone_ Task Done.[53]
It makes no difference whether the words are connected with one another
in sense or not; the searcher should not be compelled to think of that.
Let the arrangement be by words as ordinarily printed. Thus _Home Rule_
"is one idea but it is two words, and its place must be determined"
"primarily by its first word _Home_, which brings it before _Homeless_."
If it were printed _Homerule_ it would come after _Homeless_. Similarly
"_Art Amateur_ is one phrase, but as the first word _Art_ is followed by"
"a word beginning with _am_, it must come before _Art_ and _Artists_,"
although its parts are more closely connected than the parts of the
latter phrase.
Butt sitting with folded arms in a corner of the brig. He grinned at
"me. ""Hi, tadpole. Like the splash?"""
"I shook my head unhappily. ""Butt, why did you do it? I'd sure love to"
"be your brother-in-law, but, gosh, you didn't have to marry Sis."" I"
pointed at some of the bustling females. Sis was going to have three
"hundred bridesmaids. ""Any one of them would have jumped at the chance"
"to be your wife. And once on any woman's passport, you'd be free. Why"
"Sis?"""
"""That's what the Captain said in the lifeboat. Told him same thing I'm"
"telling you. I'm stubborn. What I like at first, I keep on liking. What"
"I want at first, I keep on wanting until I get."""
"""Yes, but making Sis sheriff! And you'll have to back her up with your"
"blaster. What'll happen to that man's world?"""
"""Wait'll after we nest and go out to my islands."" He produced a"
"hard-lipped, smug grin, sighting it at Sis's slender back. ""She'll"
find herself sheriff over a bunch of natives and exactly two Earth
"males--you and me. I got a hunch that'll keep her pretty busy, though."""
"He tried to stand, and realized his knees were numb. He staggered"
"backward, grabbing for something to steady himself . . . and the light"
came on.
"""Yuri Andreevich, so this is where you are. What are you doing here?"""
"It was the gravel voice of his father. He felt like a child again,"
caught with his hand in his pants. What should he do? tell the truth?
"""I'm--I'm checking over the consoles, passing the time. I couldn't"
"sleep."""
"""Don't lie to me."" Andrei Androv's ancient eyebrows gathered into the"
"skeptical furrow Yuri knew so well. ""You're up to something, another of"
"your tricks."""
Yuri stared at him a moment. How had he known? A sixth sense?
"""_Moi otyets_, why are you here? You should be getting your sleep."""
"""I'm an old man. An old man worries. I had a feeling you might be in"
"here tonight, tinkering with the vehicle. You told me you were planning"
"something. I think the time has come to tell me what it is."""
Yuri took a deep breath and looked him over.
"No, it was too risky. For them both. His secret had to be ironclad."
"""It's better if you don't know."""
"""As you wish,"" the old man sighed. ""But if you do something foolish . ."
"."""
"""For me?"""
"""For you and every one. I have hurt so many. It has all been my fault."
I would give ten lives if I had them to see the harm undone. But that
"isn't possible. Oh, Lois, there is surely nothing worse than helpless"
"remorse!"""
The hand within her own tightened in its clasp.
"""Is it ever helpless, though?"""
"""I can't give the dead life--I can't give back a man's faith, can I?"""
The light of understanding deepened in Lois' eyes.
"""Beatrice--I believe I know!"""
"""Yes, I see you do. Do you despise me? What does it matter if you do?"
It has been my fear of the world and its opinion that helped to lead
me wrong. Isn't it a just punishment? I have ruined both our lives.
"Lois, I couldn't help hearing what Captain Nicholson said to you. It"
explained what you said to me about building on the ruins of the past.
That was what he did--he built a beautiful palace on me--and I wrecked
"it. I failed him."""
"""Have you really failed him?"""
"""Lois, I don't know--I am beginning to believe not. But it is too"
late. I meant to clear away the rubbish--and build. But there is no
"time."""
"""You have done your best."""
"""How about covering the door? I think it's time we got down to business"
"and traded some bonds."""
"""With pleasure."" She stepped over and glanced out. It was clear."
"""What do you think, Alex?"" Vance turned back. ""Word's going around"
there's a hot new issue of Mino Industries zero-coupons coming out
today. What do you say we go long? In for a hundred. Just take the
"lot."""
"""I heard the same rumor, this very morning,"" he smiled. ""You're right."
"My instincts say it's a definite buy."""
"""Fine."" Vance turned to MNB's jowled branch chief. ""We'd like to do a"
little trading here this morning. Mind getting the bond desk at
Westminster Union on the line? Tell Nogami we're good for a hundred in
"Mino Industries debentures, the new issue. At par."""
"""Michael."" It was Eva's voice, suddenly alarmed."
"""What?"""
"""We've got company. They look like field reps."""
"""Good God."" Novosty strode to the door and looked out. A group of four"
"leather-jacketed Japanese were headed down the hallway, two disarmed"
MNB guards in front. Also with them was Kenji Nogami.
"Turning back, he looked imploringly at Vance. ""What do we do?"""
"""Figure they came prepared."" He waved toward Eva. ""Better lose that"
.38. Put it on the table for now. Maybe we can still talk this thing
Rockman's and another on Teal's and no knowin' how many in the bay!
"Every constable on the Cape's here, damn them! And old Davies's been"
"'round all day and he ain't rigged up for any picnic!"""
"""If we don't take it off tonight Lav Green may find it--or that girl--"""
"At that someone laughed, horribly. ""Huh--_him_! Why we could twist"
"every crooked bone in his body until he wouldn't know 'em. Him--ha,"
"that's a joke! Why, a look 'ud scare him to a pulp. The girl, too."""
"Sidney, reaching her hand out instinctively, caught Lavender's and held"
it tight. She felt the writhing of his body.
"A new voice broke in above them. ""I got a better scheme. Listen."
"We'll--"" But the voices suddenly died to silence; the footsteps moved"
away.
"The four, huddled in the darkness of the cabin, drew long trembling"
breaths.
"""Lav, those diamonds are on this boat!"""
"""Sh--h. I know it. But we got to be careful. They haven't gone yet. We"
got to wait. And we'll wait until we find 'em. Damn them _I'll_ show
"them who's crooked!"""
"""Hush,"" implored Sidney. ""Of course you will"""
"""Isn't it most morning? I--I wish I was home,"" quavered Pola; but no"
one paid any heed to her.
"With the howling of the wind, the slap-slap of the water, it was"
more.
"""You know,"" she began, ""there's more to marriage than just--"""
"""So there is,"" he cut in. ""Well, we can try each other for taste."" And"
"he pulled her in, both of his great hands practically covering her"
"slim, straight back."
Neither of them said anything for a bit after he let go. Butt spoke up
first.
"""Now, me,"" he said, ""I'd vote yes."""
Sis ran the tip of her tongue kind of delicately from side to side
of her mouth. Then she stepped back slowly and looked at him as if
she were figuring out how many feet high he was. She kept on moving
"backward, tapping her chin, while Butt and I got more and more"
"impatient. When she touched the lifeboat door, she pushed it open and"
jumped out.
*       *       *       *       *
"Butt ran over and looked down the crossway. After a while, he shut the"
"door and came back beside me. ""Well,"" he said, swinging to a bunk,"
"""that's sort of it."""
"""You're better off, Butt,"" I burst out. ""You shouldn't have a woman"
"like Sis for a wife. She looks small and helpless, but don't forget"
"she was trained to run an underwater city!"""
"""Wasn't worrying about that,"" he grinned. ""_I_ grew up in the fifteen"
"long years of the Blue Chicago Rising. Nope."" He turned over on his"
"her waist: ""Ah, my Gyp!  I shall be a different being, now."""
"And Gyp went on smiling.  Between that, and stabbing these false raptures"
"to the heart, there seemed to be nothing she could do. The moment his"
"hands relaxed, she got up and said:"
"""You know there's a baby in the house?"""
He laughed.
"""Ah, the baby!  I'd forgotten.  Let's go up and see it."""
Gyp answered:
"""You go."""
She could feel him thinking: 'Perhaps it will make her nice to me!' He
turned suddenly and went.
"She stood with her eyes shut, seeing the divan in the music-room and the"
"girl's arm shivering.  Then, going to the piano, she began with all her"
might to play a Chopin polonaise.
"That evening they dined out, and went to ""The Tales of Hoffmann."" By such"
devices it was possible to put off a little longer what she was going to
"do.  During the drive home in the dark cab, she shrank away into her"
"corner, pretending that his arm would hurt her dress; her exasperated"
nerves were already overstrung.  Twice she was on the very point of
"crying out: ""I am not Daphne Wing!""  But each time pride strangled the"
words in her throat.  And yet they would have to come.  What other reason
could she find to keep him from her room?
"like another one behind it, with a raft of piles."""
"""I thought all the Company traps were up-stream."""
"""So they are. I can't tell what they're up to."""
"A half-hour later, when the new flotilla had come to anchor a short"
"distance below, Emerson's companion began to swear."
"""I might have known it."""
"""What?"""
"""Marsh aims to 'cork' us."""
"""What is that?"""
"""He's going to build a trap on each side of this one and cut off our"
"fish."""
"""Good Lord! Can he do that?"""
"""Sure. Why not? The law gives us six hundred yards both ways. As long"
"as he stays outside of that limit he can do anything he wants to."""
"""Then of what use is our trap? The salmon follow definite courses close"
"to the shore, and if he intercepts them before they reach us--why, then"
"we'll get only what he lets through."""
"""That's his plan,"" said Big George, sourly, ""It's an old game, but it"
don't always work. You can't tell what salmon will do till they do it.
"I've studied this point of land for five years, and I know more about"
"""No. In his way, I suppose he was fond of her. But--she didn't like his"
"way. She was very beautiful, and I fell in love with her, and she with"
"me. And we ran away."""
"""Is--is that all? Is there no----?"""
"""No excuse? No, I suppose, none. And I lived with her till she died four"
"years ago. And--Daisy is our daughter."""
"""And he--the husband?"""
"""He did not divorce her. I don't know why not, perhaps because she asked"
him to--anyhow he didn't. And he outlived her: so she died--as she had
"lived."""
"""And is he still alive?"""
"""No; he is dead now."" He was about to go on, but checked himself. Why"
add that horror? How the man died was nothing between her and him.
"""Have you no--nothing to say?"" she burst out, almost angrily. ""You just"
"tell me that and stop!"""
"""What is there to say? I have told you all there is to tell. I loved her"
"very much. I did what I could to make her happy, and I try to make up"
"for it to Daisy. But there is nothing more to say."""
"She was angry that he would not defend himself. She was ready--ah, so"
ready!--to listen to his pleading. But he would not say a word for
"himself. Instead, he went on,"
"""She didn't want to come, but I made her. She repented, poor girl, all"
"""What?"" She was shakily rising, pulling her yukata around her."
"""All the comforts of home. Too bad they forgot the geisha."""
"She came over and stood beside him. ""I don't believe this."""
"""Want to see if it's real, or just a mirage?"""
"She hesitantly stepped onto the decking, then walked out and bent down"
"to test the water. ""Feels wet."" She glanced back. ""So what the heck. I"
"could use it."""
"""I'm ready."" He kicked off his tabi and walked on out."
"She pulled off his _yukata_, then picked up one of the pails and began"
"filling it from a spigot on the wall. ""Okay, exalted male,"" she"
"laughed, ""I'm going to scrub you. That's how they do it, right?"" She"
stood up and reached for a sponge and soap.
"""They know how to live. Here, let me."" He picked up a second sponge and"
"began scrubbing her back in turn. ""How does it feel?"""
"""Maybe this is heaven."""
"""Hope we didn't have to die to get here. But hang on. I've got a"
"feeling the fun is just beginning."""
"He splashed her off with one of the pails, then watched as she gingerly"
climbed down into the wooden tub.
"""Michael, where do you think we are?"" She sighed as the steam enveloped"
"her. ""This has got to be Japan, but where?"""
the cotters to see how they were getting on.
"""So that's where he's gone?"" he said. ""Well, let him stay there, for all I"
"care!"""
The manufacturer cracked jokes to the very end. Of course he was a little
"depressed by the farewells, too, but he had to keep his family's courage"
"up. His wife stood holding one of his arms with both hands, and the"
children clung to his other arm.
"""I can't salute you,"" the manufacturer said to us, smiling. ""I'm not"
"allowed to say good-bye."""
"The children rejoiced at this and cried, ""No, he can't have his arm back;"
"Mummy, you hold him tight, too!"""
"""Come, come!"" the father said. ""I've got to go to Scotland, just a short"
"trip. And when you come home from the mountains, I'll be there, too."""
"""Scotland? What are you going to Scotland for?"" the children asked."
He twisted round and nodded to us.
"""These women! All curiosity!"" he said."
But none of his family laughed.
He continued to us:
"""I was telling my wife a story about a rich man who was curious, too. He"
"shot himself just to find out what comes after death. Ha, ha, ha! That's"
"the height of curiosity, isn't it? Shooting yourself to find out what"
"""I don't borrow."""
"""Ingeborg!"" said he, pretending playfully to whimper."
"""What is it?"""
"""Nothing. Can't I say 'Ingeborg' to my own wife?"""
"""I'm not your own wife,"" she said, getting up."
"""Pish! We were man and wife last night. It says so in the visitors' book."""
"She was silent at this. Yes, last night they had been man and wife; that"
"was to save getting two rooms, and travel economically. But she had been"
very foolish to agree to it.
"""'Miss Torsen,' then?"" he whimpered."
"And to put an end to the game, she paid for both of them and took her"
knapsack on her back.
They walked again. At the next stop she paid for them both without
"discussion--for the evening meal, for bed and breakfast. It grew to be a"
habit. They walked on once more. They reached the end of the valley by the
"sea, and here she revolted again."
"""Go away--go on by yourself; I don't want you in my room any more!"""
The old argument no longer held good. When he repeated that they saved
"money by it, she replied that she for her part required no more than one"
"room, and was quite able to pay for it. He joked again, whimpered,"
"""Ingeborg!"" and left her. He was beaten, and his back was bent."
"Suddenly he flung in upon us with a great noise, his colour high, his"
eyes glittering. His first action was to throw his feathered hat on
"one chair, and himself into another."
'I've seen him!' he said. 'Himmel! he is a clever fellow. He will
"worst you, cousin, yet--see if he does not. Oh, he is a clever one!'"
"'Who?' my lady said, looking at him in some displeasure."
"'Who? Tzerclas, to be sure!' he answered, chuckling."
"'You have seen him!' she exclaimed, rising."
"'Of course I have!' he answered. 'And you will see him too, one of"
these days.'
"My lady looked at me, frowning. But I shook my head. He was not drunk."
"'Where?' she asked, after a pause. 'Where did you see him, Rupert?'"
"'In the street--where you see other men,' he answered, chuckling"
"again. 'He should not be there, but who is to keep him out? He is too"
"clever. He will get his way in the end, see if he does not!'"
"'Rupert!' my lady cried in wrathful amazement, 'to hear you, one would"
suppose you admired him.'
"'So I do,' he replied coolly. 'Why not? He has all the wits of the"
"family. He is as cunning as the devil. Take a hint, cousin; put"
yourself on the right side. He will win in the end!' And the Waldgrave
"rose restlessly from his chair, and, going to the window, began to"
whistle.
"over it, and charging on and on and on through the darkness."
"To the foot of the hill and across the bottom, and up the opposite"
"slope. I do not know how far we had sped, when Steve's voice was"
"heard, calling on us to halt."
"'Pull up! pull up!' he cried, with an angry oath. 'It is a false"
alarm! What fool set it going? There is no one behind us. Donner und
Blitzen! where is Martin?'
"The horses were beginning to flag, and gladly came to a trot, and then"
to a walk.
'Here! I panted.
"'Himmel! I thought we had ridden you down!' he said, leaving my lady's"
side. His voice shook with passion and loss of breath. 'Who was it? We
"might all have broken our necks, and for nothing!'"
The Waldgrave--it was his stirrup I had caught--turned his horse
round. 'I heard them--close behind us!' he panted. There was a note of
"wildness in his voice. My elbow was against his knee, and I felt him"
tremble.
"'A bird in the hedge,' Steve said rudely. 'It has cost some one dear."
Whose horse was it struck him?'
No one answered. I left the Waldgrave's side and went back a few
"paces. The women were sobbing. Ernst and Jacob stood by them,"
breathing hard after their run. I thought the men's silence strange. I
looked again. There was a figure missing; a horse missing.
"""Never!"""
Monsieur Harmost's eyebrows rose.
"""Ah,"" he said, ""you think!  No, that is impossible!""  He walked twice"
"very quickly up and down the room; then spinning round on his heel, said"
"sharply: ""Well, we must not waste your father's time. To work."""
Winton's simple comment in the cab on the way home was:
"""Nice old chap!"""
"At Bury Street, they found Gyp's agitated parlour-maid.  Going to do the"
"music-room that morning, she had ""found the master sitting on the sofa,"
"holding his head, and groaning awful.  He's not been at home, ma'am,"
"since you--you went on your visit, so I didn't know what to do.  I ran"
"for cook and we got him up to bed, and not knowing where you'd be, ma'am,"
"I telephoned to Count Rosek, and he came--I hope I didn't do wrong--and"
he sent me down to see you. The doctor says his brain's on the touch and
"go, and he keeps askin' for you, ma'am.  So I didn't know what to do."""
"Gyp, pale to the lips, said:"
"""Wait here a minute, Ellen,"" and went into the dining-room.  Winton"
"followed.  She turned to him at once, and said:"
"""Oh, Dad, what am I to do?  His brain!  It would be too awful to feel I'd"
"brought that about."""
Winton grunted.  Gyp went on:
"""I must go and see.  If it's really that, I couldn't bear it.  I'm afraid"
_stupid_. And I kept wondering what you were doing. I coaxed mother to
let Shields bring me back and she said she would provided I came and
stayed with you tonight. Can you squeeze me in? Dug will give me his
"room, I know."""
"Sidney cast a wild glance toward Mart. She started to answer, then"
stopped. Pola looked from her to Mart and back again to Sidney.
"""What's the mystery? If you don't want me I'll go to the hotel."""
"""Oh, Pola, it isn't that. It's--it's--"""
"""Sidney Romley I'll bet you're up to something! And if you are, you"
simply have got to let me in on it! I'm just pepped up to some
"excitement. Tell me what's up."""
"The girls turned slowly and walked toward Lav and the dory, Pola"
between them.
"""It isn't any fun,"" Sidney explained slowly. ""It's something"
serious--and--and dangerous. And you'll have to ask Mart and Lav if you
"can come with us."""
"""You'll let me go, won't you, Mart?"" Pola begged with friendly"
"entreaty, forgetting she had ever thought Mart a riot."
Sidney introduced Pola to Lavender and turned away that she might not
see the pain that flashed across Lavender's face.
"""Pola came back to stay all night with me. She wants to go with us and"
"if she doesn't I guess I'll have to go back home."""
"""I damned sure intend to try."" He met his father's steely gaze."
"""So did you do it?"" Andrei Androv examined him, his ancient face ashen"
"beneath his mane of white hair. ""Did you manage to sabotage the AI"
"module?"""
"He caught himself laughing out loud. Whatever else, his father was no"
fool. He'd been a Russian too long to believe anything he heard or half
of what he saw. Intrigue was a way of life for him.
"""Let's go. They'll come looking for us soon. This is the wrong place to"
"be found."""
"""You're right."""
"""Go back to the West Quadrant. Listen to a string quartet."" He opened"
"the port and waited for his father to step out. Then he followed,"
"closing it behind them. ""There's no reason for you to be involved."
"Heads are going to roll, but why should yours be one of them?"""
"Andrei Petrovich Androv moved lightly up the metal stair, the spring in"
his step belying his age. At the top he paused and turned back.
"""You're acting out of principle, aren't you, Yuri? For once in your"
"life."""
"""I guess you could say that."" He smiled, then moved on up the steps."
"""Someday, the Russian people will thank you."""
"""Someday. Though I may not live to see it."""
"""Want to give you a little tip, too. They want you upstairs. A"
"commendation. Not generally known, though. And you deserve it. You'll be"
"called up tomorrow."""
"""You never know the day or the hour."""
"The laugh came again. ""You're humor is priceless, old man."""
"""Isn't it?"""
"""Another thing--I got pretty hot when I got wind of how the ground was"
being cut out from under you. I made it my business to do something
about it. I hate to see a good man pushed around. Of course I okayed the
orders cutting you down--a matter of routine--I had to follow through.
"But then I got busy. A thing like that won't happen again."""
"""Thanks, Porter. It warms a man to know he's got a friend--a friend like"
"you."""
"""Just between us, old man, I'm one of your admirers."" Porter laughed and"

body against the rail for support as the boat rolled in the heavy sea.
"She cupped her hands to her lips and shouted lustily. ""Come on, girls!"""
she commanded.
"""Maybe it's the pirates,"" wailed Pola."
"""I don't care if it is! I don't care _what_ it is!"" And Mart and Sidney"
lifted their chorus.

their ears. After a little they could make out the forms of two men
standing. And then someone shouted faintly.
"Pola, a solemn happiness transfiguring her face, clung to Sidney."
"""Girls,"" she whispered, ""We're going to be saved! And I'll never forget"

He was stopped short by Norton who took one long step forward to grasp
"him by the coat lapels. Andrews' face went white, because he was"
looking into the face of dark anger. Norton's other hand was clenched
"in a large, tight fist. He eyed the older man sourly for a minute, then"
shoved him backward to collapse in a chair.
"""What are you trying to do?"" sneered Norton. ""Make me mad enough to"
clip you so you can yell 'Foul!'? I know as well as you do that the law
doesn't even recognize taunts and tongue-lashings as contributory to

"Alice got up from her couch and stood between them. ""Stop it, both of"

"There was a brief, noisy interval, during which Emerson was too"

hysterically:
"""There he is, men. He tried to murder me. I--I'm hurt. I'll have him"

The seriousness of the accusation struck the young man on the instant;
he turned upon the group.
"""I didn't do that. I heard a fight going on and ran in here--"""
"""He's a liar,"" the wounded man interrupted, shrilly. ""He stabbed me!"
"See?"" He tried to strip the shirt from his wounds, then fell to"
"chattering and shaking. ""Oh, God! I'm hurt."" He staggered to a"
packing-case and sank upon it weakly fumbling at his sodden shoulder.
"""I didn't do that,"" repeated Boyd. ""I don't know who stabbed him. I"
"didn't."""
"""Then who did?"" some one demanded."
"""What are you doing in here? You'd a killed him in a minute,"" said the"
man with the lantern.
"""We'll fix you for this,"" a third voice threatened."
"""Listen,"" Boyd said, in a tone to make them pause. ""There has been a"
"mistake here. I was passing the building when I heard a woman scream,"
"and I rushed in to prevent Marsh from choking her to death."""
"calmly, and added, with a sigh, ""I have no doubt he would have landed"
"you in rather an awkward fix ... had we not taken pity upon you."""
"""Ah!""  And the angry soldier raised his hand.  ""There are two of them"
"...  One of them discovered it, the other wrote the petition, the"

"""Why the reporter?"""

"""And this reporter, who is he?"" asked Petunikoff, with interest."
"""He?  A drunkard.  He was a teacher but was dismissed.  He drank"
everything he possessed ... and now he writes for the papers and

discovered the flaws in the building.  The beams were not rightly put
"in?"""
"""He did!  I know it for a fact!  The dog!  He read it aloud in here and"
"boasted, 'Now I have caused Petunikoff some loss!'"""

"condemned her to, what manner of man he was; he must seem to destroy or"

"He opened the door softly. She was sitting in a large armchair, over a"
"little bit of bright fire; save for gleams suddenly coming and going, as"
"a coal blazed and died down again, the room was in darkness. He walked"
"up to her and knelt by the chair, his head almost on a level with hers."
"""Well, Daisy, what are you doing?"""
She put out a hand and laid it on his with a gentle pressure.
"""I'm thinking,"" she said. ""Do you want a light?"""
"""No, I like it dark best--best for what I have to say."""
"Suddenly she threw her arms round his neck, drawing him to her and"
kissing his face.
"""I'd do the same if you'd killed him yourself,"" she whispered in the"
"extravagance of her love, and kissed him again."
"""But, Daisy, you don't know."""
"""Yes, I do. He told me. He's been here."""
"""Who?"""
"""Jack Norburn. He said you would hate telling me, so he did. You mustn't"

"'It should be in this direction,' Steve said, with an accent of doubt."
'But I cannot see. We shall have the horses down.'
"'Let me go first,' I said."
"'We must not separate,' he answered hastily."
"'No, no,' I said, my teeth beginning to chatter. 'But are you sure"
that there is an eyot here?'
"'I did not go to it,' he answered, scratching his head. 'But I saw a"
"clump of willows rising well above the level, and they looked to me as"
if they grew on dry land.'
"He stood a moment irresolutely, first one and then another of the"
horses shaking itself till the women could scarcely keep their seats.
'Why do we not go on?' my lady asked in a low voice.
"'Because Steve is not sure of the place, my lady,' I said. 'And it is"
"almost impossible to move, it is so dark, and the osiers grow so"
closely. I doubt we should have waited until daylight.'
"'Then we should have run the risk of being intercepted,' she answered"
feverishly. 'Are you very wet?'
"'No,' I said, though my feet were growing numb, 'not very. I see what"
we must do. One of us must climb into a willow and look out.'
We had passed a small one not long before. I plashed my way back to

_were_ my mother.”
"“Now, don’t be unreasonable, or I shall believe that you are a tyrant.”"

are! I never should have thought it—I mean—darling! you were always

"did—oh, hang it all—but if I let you have your own way in this"

"“Well, on one condition.”"
“Any! Any!”
“It must be an absolute secret until the wedding is over. I hate

well have a good concentrated one.”
"“I agree with you, and I’ll never find fault with you again. You—”"
Miss Decker almost ran into the room.
"“Jessica!” she cried. “Oh, dear Mr. Dedham, how are you? Jessica, mother"
"has one of her terrible attacks, and I must ask you to stay with her"
while I go for the doctor myself. I cannot trust servants.”
“Let me go! let me go!” cried Teddy. “I’ll bring him back in a quarter
of an hour. Who shall—”
Her face was pale and drawn; her smile was as abstract as the mystery on
the lips of the Mona Lisa. She laid a hand on the suitcase.
"""We had our first quarrel over it, remember? We went to Puerto Rico for"

"we'll have to stay."""
"""Pola!"" Her mother called sharply."
"Pola waved her hand toward her mother. ""Yes, mamma!"" Then, to Sidney,"
"""Isn't it simply rare our meeting like this? It shows how small the"
"world is. I must run now! By-by!"" She gave the slightest flip of her"
"hand in sign of leave-taking and, turning, ran lightly up the wharf"
toward her mother.
"Sidney's eyes followed her, devouring her dainty clothes, the"
"tight-fitting motoring hat, the buckled pumps. Pola--the Pola she had"
"carried enshrined in her heart! That heart hurt now, to the core. She"
"had dreamed of a meeting sometime, somewhere, had planned just what it"
would be like and what she'd say and what Pola would say. And now Pola
had turned a shoulder upon it.
Mart's laugh behind her roused her.
"""Who's Guinevere, anyway? Her ma called her just in time--we might a"
"hurt the doll-baby!"""
"Sidney turned on Mart fiercely. ""She's a friend of mine,"" she cried, in"
"a voice she made rough to keep the tears from it. ""And she's _not_ a"
"doll-baby."""
"""All right--go and play with her then--she's crazy about you, I guess."""
"And with that Mart swung on her heel and stalked away, her head in the"
air.
Poor Sidney hurried back to Sunset Lane to hide her humiliation and her
"""Yes, yes; that's nothing!  Don't cry--don't cry!"""
"Very slowly the sobbing died away, till it was just a long shivering, but"
still the girl held her hands over her face and her face down.  Gyp felt
"paralyzed.  The unhappy girl, the red and green room, the smell of"
mutton--creeping!
"At last, a little of that white face showed; the lips, no longer craving"
"for sugar-plums, murmured:"
"""It's you he--he--really loves all the time.  And you don't love"
"him--that's what's so funny--and--and--I can't understand it.  Oh, Mrs."
"Fiorsen, if I could see him--just see him!  He told me never to come"
again; and I haven't dared.  I haven't seen him for three weeks--not
"since I told him about IT.  What shall I do?  What shall I do?"""
His being her own husband seemed as nothing to Gyp at that moment. She
felt such pity and yet such violent revolt that any girl should want to
"crawl back to a man who had spurned her.  Unconsciously, she had drawn"
"herself up and pressed her lips together.  The girl, who followed every"
"movement, said piteously:"
"""I don't seem to have any pride.  I don't mind what he does to me, or"
"what he says, if only I can see him."""
Gyp's revolt yielded to her pity.  She said:
"""How long before?"""
"""Three months."""
"her life; she was never quite happy. It was all my doing. Still, I think"
"she was happier with me, in spite of it."""
"A movement of impatience escaped from Alicia. Seeing it he added,"
"""I beg your pardon. I didn't want you to think hardly of her."""
"""I don't want to think of her at all. Was she--was she like Daisy?"""
"""Yes; but prettier."""
"""I don't know what you expect me to say,"" she exclaimed. ""I know--I"
suppose some men don't think much of--of a thing like that. To me it is
"horrible. You simply followed your-- Ah, I can't speak of it!"" and she"
seemed to put him from her with a gesture of disgust.
"He walked beside her in silence, his face set in the bitter smile it"
always wore when fate dealt hardly with him.
"""I think I'll go straight home,"" she said, stopping suddenly. ""You can"
"join the others."""
"""Yes, that will be best. I'm not due at the Council just yet."""
"""I suppose I ought to thank you for telling me the truth. I--"" Her false"
composure suddenly gave way. With a sob she stretched out her hands
"towards him, crying, ""Why didn't you tell me sooner?"" and before he"
"could answer her she turned and walked swiftly away, leaving him"
standing still on the pathway.
She was hardly inside the gates of Government House when she saw Eleanor
"Scaife, who hurried to meet her."
"""But what was the cause of it all?""  I demanded.  ""You surely know the"
"reason?"""
"""No, we cannot yet tell,"" he answered.  ""The marks puzzle us.  That mark"
on her lower lip is the most peculiar and unaccountable.  At present we
"can say nothing."""
"""Then why did you call me out?"""
"""Because I want to consult you,"" he replied.  ""The fact is, that in this"
affair there is a strong element of mystery which I don't like at all.
"And, moreover, the few seconds during which I've seen the Countess have"
plainly impressed upon me the belief that either she has had something
"to do with it, or else that she knows the truth."""
"I nodded.  This was exactly my own theory.  ""Do you think Yolande has"
"been the victim of foul play?""  I inquired a moment later."
"""That's my suspicion,"" he responded.  ""But only she herself can tell us"
"the truth."""
"""You really think, then, that a dastardly attempt has been made upon her"
"life?""  I cried incredulously."
"""Personally, I think there can be no doubt."""
"""But by whom?  No one called here after my departure."""
"""It is that mystery which we must elucidate,"" he said.  ""All I fear is,"
"however, that she may render us no assistance."""
“But if it will kill you?”
"“Bah. What do I care? When one lives, one amuses oneself. And I have"
"well amused myself, eh, Yvonne? For the rest, _je m’en fiche!_”"
He went on talking with airy cynicism. To Yvonne it seemed some horrible
"dream. The husband she had looked upon as dead was before her, gay,"
"mocking, just as she had known him of old. And he greeted her after all"
these years with the-same lightness as he had bidden her farewell.
"“_Et toi, Yvonne?_” said he at length. “_Ça roule toujours?_ You"
look as if you were brewing money. Ravishing costume. _Crépon_--not
twenty-five centimes a yard! A hat that looks like the Rue de la Paix!
_Gants de reine et petites bottines de duchesse!_ You must be doing
"golden business. But speak, _petite_, since I assure you I am not a"
ghost!”
"Yvonne forced a faint smile. She tried to answer him, but her heart was"
thumping violently and a lump rose in her throat.
"“I am doing very well, Amédée,” she said. The dreadfulness of her"
position came over her. She felt sick and faint. What was going to
happen? For some moments she did not hear him as he spoke. At last
perception returned.
"“And you are pretty,” Amédée Bazouge was saying. “_Mais jolie à"
croquer_--prettier than you ever were. And I--I am going down the hill
"at the gallop. _Tiens_, Yvonne. Let us celebrate this meeting. Come and"
see me safe to the bottom. It won’t be long. I have money. I am always
_bon enfant._ Let us remarry. From to-day. _Ce serait rigolo!_ And I
will love you--_mais énormément!_”
"""Have you ever heard the like of it? She told me to get out! I shall leave"
"tomorrow."""
"""Have you found the galoshes?"" I asked."
"""Of course,"" he replied. ""They were right in the passage. 'Here they are,'"
"I said to her. 'Yes, yes,' she said. 'Right under your nose,' I said."
"'Yes, yes, go away,' she said, and began to cry. So I went away."""
"""She'll get over it."""
"""Do you think so? Yes, I expect she will. Oh, well, it's my opinion nobody"
"can understand women, anyhow. But they're a mighty sex, the women, a"
"mighty sex. They certainly are."""
"He sat on a while, but he had no peace of mind, and soon went out again."

That evening the lady was in the dining room before us; she was there when
"we came in, and we all nodded slightly in greeting. To the actor she was"
"very kind, quite making up for her petulance of the afternoon."
When he sat down he found a letter in his table napkin: a written note
folded into the napkin. He was so surprised that he dropped everything he
"was doing to unfold and read it. With an exclamation and a smile, his"
"blue, delighted eyes splashed over her; but she was looking down into her"
"lap with her forehead wrinkled, so he put the note away in his vest"
pocket.
"Then it probably dawned on him that he had betrayed her, and he tried to"
cover it up somehow.
wings.
"The Canon came later to her room, kindly solicitous. Was she ill? Would"
she like to see a medical man? Should he sit with her? She clasped his
hand impulsively and kissed it.
“You are too good to me. I am not worth it. I am not ill. It was the
"sun, I think. Let me lie down this afternoon by myself and I shall be"
better.”
"Surprised and touched by her action, he bent down and kissed her."
“My poor little wife.”
He stepped to the window and pulled the curtain to shield her eyes from
"the glare, and promising to order some tea to be brought up later, he"
went out.
"The kiss, the term, and the little act of thoughtfulness comforted her,"
gave her a sense of protection. She had been so bruised and frightened.
Now she could think a little. Should she tell Everard? Then she broke
down again and began to cry silently in a great soothing pity for
herself.
"“It would only make him unhappy,” she moaned. “Why should I tell him?”"
She grew calmer. If Amédée would only keep his promise and leave her
"free, there was really nothing to fret about. She reassured herself with"
his words. Through all his failings toward her he had ever been “_bon
enfant_.” There was no danger.
Suddenly a thought came that made her spring from her bed in dismay. The
"""But the diamonds!"" she cried."
"""_Diamonds_--"" Cap'n Davies stared at her, his mouth open."
"""Why, yes, they're on this boat. They _must_ be! We were in the forward"
cabin watching and Jed Starrow came on board and they talked right
where we could hear. They were going to take them off and then they
decided it wasn't safe and they'd wait and they went away. And then
they must have cut the boat adrift. But we're _sure_ they're on this
"boat."""
"""So that was it! Of all the low-down dastardly tricks! Well, never mind"
"your diamonds, now. We got to get back to shore and let a few folks"
"know--"""
"""But I won't _go_ until we've looked!"" Sidney protested, almost in"
"tears. ""Why, that was why we risked everything! And Lav wants to save"
"the name of the Cape--the--the way--you do! Oh, please look!"""
"The old Captain dropped his hold of the girl's arm. ""Well, I'll be"
"ding-blasted!"" he stormed. But he motioned to Saunders. ""Climb aboard"
and give us a hand. 'Taint likely they'd hide their stuff above deck.
You look round the stern and the girls and me'll give a hunt forward.
"Of all the stubborn, crazy-headed female pieces you'll beat 'em all!"""
While Saunders searched the stern of the schooner the Captain and
"Sidney and Mart searched the fo'castle cabin. Sidney, tugging away the"
"heavy tarpaulins, disclosed a small wooden box."
"""I'm _sure_ it wasn't there before--"" she cried. ""Why--why, I was"
"_sitting_ on it--"""
"""When do you propose to make the start, Colonel?"" Nicholson asked."
"""Within an hour. The night favors us. The women must be kept in the"
center as much as possible. I have given Geoffries special charge over
them. They will be told at the last moment. There is no use in
"spoiling what little rest they have had."" He drew out a pencil and"
"began to scribble a despatch on the back of an old letter. ""I advise"
"you gentlemen to do likewise,"" he said. ""Very often a piece of paper"
"gets through where a man can not, and it is our bounden duty to supply"
"the morning periodicals with as much news as possible."""
For some minutes there was no sound save that of the pencils scrawling
the last messages of men with the seal of death already stamped upon
"their foreheads. All three had forgotten Travers, and yet from the"
moment they had begun to speak he had been awake and listening. He sat
"up now, leaning upon his elbow."
"""Nicholson!"" he said faintly."
Nicholson turned and came to his side.
"""Hullo!"" he said. ""Awake, are you? How are you?"""
Travers made no immediate answer; he took Nicholson's hand in a
feverish clasp and drew him nearer.
"""I am in great pain,"" he said. ""You don't need to pretend. I know. The"
fear of death has been on me all day. Just now I am not afraid. Is
"there no hope?"""
"""You mean--for us? None."""
"""Looks like too little, too late."" He stretched beside her."
"""What did she mean just now? About our 'contribution'?"""
"""Probably the protocol. My guess is she wants to see it destroyed."
Let's hope that'll be the end of it. The godfather's got his money. And
"Alex's problem is solved permanently."""
"Now Kenji Nogami was entering the room, an island of Zen-like calm"
amidst all the bedlam.
"""Michael, I'm so sorry."" He stepped over. ""When the money didn't show"
"up as scheduled, they called Jiro Sato and he suggested they try here."
"There was nothing I could do."""
"Vance nodded. ""That's how I figured it'd be played. We didn't move fast"
"enough on this end. It was my fault."""
"""Too bad. We came close."" He sighed. ""But I'm not going to underwrite"
"the rest of those bogus debentures. He'll have to kill me."""
"""And he'll probably do just that. The hell with it. You tried, we all"
tried. Now it looks like Tanzan Mino's scam is going to go through
whether we play or not. You might as well save your own skin. With any
"luck, we can still sort out our end, but you--you're going to have to be"
"dealing with that bastard for years to come. Think about it."""
"""I'm still deciding,"" he said finally. ""Let's wait and see how things"
"go."""
"""Alex opted for suicide. You shouldn't follow his lead."""
"'Then now go! Go out, do you hear?' she cried, stamping her foot with"
passion. 'I want nothing. Go!'
I turned and crept towards the door like a beaten hound. But I was not
"to go; when my hand was on the latch, her mood changed."
"'No, stay,' she said in a different tone. 'You may come back. After"
"all, Martin, I had rather it was you than any one else.'"
"She dried her tears as she spoke, standing up very straight and proud,"
and hiding nothing. I felt a pang as I looked at her. I had neglected
her of late. I had been thinking more of others.
"'It is nothing, Martin,' she said after a pause, and when she had"
quite composed her face. 'You need not be frightened. All women cry a
"little sometimes, as men swear,' she added, smiling."
"'You have been looking at that thing outside,' I said, grumbling."
"'Perhaps it did upset me,' she replied. 'But I think it was that I"
felt--a little lonely.'
"That sounded so strange a complaint on her lips, seeing that the echo"
"of the young sparks' laughter was barely dead in the room, that I"
"stared. But I took it, on second thoughts, to refer to Fraulein Max,"
"whom she had kept at a distance since our escape, never sitting down"
"with her, or speaking to her except on formal occasions; and I said"
bluntly--
"'You need a woman friend, my lady.'"
"Well, it was not much to go away with, but perhaps that doesn't matter. As"
long as one has a reason to go away.
*       *       *       *       *
"Later in the forenoon Eilert returned home. He was alone, but he came up"
the path carrying one of the knapsacks--the larger one. He was in a
"furious temper, and kept saying they'd better not try it on him--no,"
they'd just better not.
Of course it was the bill again.
"""She'll probably have a good deal of this sort of trouble,"" I thought to"
"myself, ""but no doubt she'll get used to it, and take it as nonchalantly"
"as it should be taken. There are worse things."""
"But the fact remains that it was I that upset them, I that had driven them"
away without their clothes; perhaps they had really expected some money to
be sent here--who knows?
"I got hold of Eilert. How big was the bill? What, was that all? ""Good"
"heavens! Here you are, here's your money; now row across to them at once"
"with their clothes!"""
"But it all proved in vain, for the strangers had gone; they had arrived"
"just in time for the boat, and were aboard it at that very moment."
"Well, there was no help for it."
"""Here's their address,"" says Eilert. ""We can send the clothes next"
"Thursday; that's the next trip the boat goes south again."""
"and Lady Eynesford, and all the rest, but what do I care if I have you"
"and him?"""
"""Me and him, Daisy?"""
"""Yes,"" she answered, smiling boldly. ""He's asked me to marry him--just"
"to show he didn't mind--and I think I will, father. We three against the"
"world! What need we care? Father, we'll beat Sir Robert!"" and she seized"
his two hands and laughed.
In vain Medland tried to tell her what he had come to say. Mighty as his
"relief and joy were, he still felt a burden lay on him. She would not"
hear.
"""Don't you see I'm happy?"" she cried. ""It can't be your duty to make me"
"unhappy. Jack doesn't mind, I don't mind!"" Her voice sank a little and"
"she added, ""It can't hurt mother now. Oh, don't be unhappy about it,"
"dear--don't, don't!"""
"They were standing now, and his arm was about her. Looking up at him,"
"she went on,"
"""They shan't beat us! They shan't say they beat us. We three, father!"""
He stooped and kissed her. There is love that lies beyond the realm of
"giving or taking, of harm or good, of wrong, or even of forgiveness."
"With all his faults, this love he had won from his daughter, and it"
"stood him in stead that night. He drew himself up to his height, and the"
air of despondency fell from him. The girl's brave love braced him to
meet the world again.
"""No, by Jove, we're not beat yet, Daisy!"" he said, and she kissed him"
"house of four stories, three gables in width. The upper stories jutted"
"out; the beams on which they rested were finely carved, the gables"
"were finished off with rich, wooden pinnacles. In each story, the"
"lowest excepted, were three long, low windows of the common Nuremberg"
"type, and the whole had a substantial and reputable air."
"The window at which I had seen Marie was farthest from the door, on"
"the first floor. To go to the door I had to lose sight of it, and"
perhaps for that reason I stood the longer. At last I went and
"knocked, and waited in a fever for some one to come. The street was a"
thoroughfare. There were a number of people passing. I thought that
all the town would go by before a dragging foot at last sounded
"inside, and the great nail-studded door was opened on the chain. A"
"stout, red-faced woman showed herself in the aperture."
'What is it?' she asked.
"'You have a girl in this house, named Marie Wort,' I answered"
"breathlessly. 'I saw her a moment ago at the window. I know her, and I"
wish to speak to her.'
The woman's little eyes dwelt on me stolidly for a space. Then she
made as if she would shut the door. 'For shame!' she said spitefully.
'We have no girls here. Begone with you!'
But I put my foot against the door. 'Whose house is this?' I said.
"'Herr Krapp's,' she answered crustily."
'Is he at home?'
"'No, he is not,' she retorted; 'and if he were, we have no baggages"
"'North,' he whispered."
"After that they were nothing to me, but I went with the rest. Our lair"
"was in some rocks overhanging the road. By the time we looked over,"
"the horsemen were below us, and we could see nothing of them; though"
"the sullen tramp of their horses, and the jingle of bit and spur,"
reached us clearly. Presently they came into sight again on the road
"beyond, riding steadily away with their backs to us."
'That is not General Tzerclas?' my lady muttered anxiously.
'Nor any of his people!' Steve said with an oath.
"That led me to look more closely, and I saw in a moment something that"
lifted me out of my moodiness. I sprang on the rock against which I
was leaning and shouted long and loudly.
"'Himmel!' Steve cried, seizing me by the ankle. 'Are you mad, man?'"
"But I only shouted again, and waved my cap frantically. Then I slipped"
"down, sobered. 'They see us,' I cried. 'They are Leuchtenstein's"
"riders. And Count Hugo is with them. You are safe, my lady.'"
"She turned white and red, and I saw her clutch at the rock to keep"
herself on her feet. 'Are you sure?' she said. The troop had halted
and were wheeling slowly and in perfect order.
"'Quite sure, my lady,' I answered, with a touch of bitterness in my"
tone. Why had not this happened yesterday or the day before? Then my
girl would have been saved. Now it came too late! Too late! No wonder
I felt bitterly about it.
aid. The thought of either was unendurable. I hated him—yet was
dependent on him.
"“To-night I met him, in his empty apartment, alone. I knew that he had"
"what was left of his money with him, that everything was packed up. I"
went prepared. I would not elope. My plan was no less than to make him
pay the balance on the necklace that he had lost—or to murder him.
"“I carried a new pistol in my muff, one which Lynn had just bought. I"
don’t know how I did it. I was desperate.
"“He told me he loved me, that Lynn did not, never had—that Lynn had"
"married me only to show off his wealth and diamonds, to give him a"
social! position—that I was merely a—a piece of property—a dummy.
“He tried to kiss me. It was revolting. I struggled away from him.
"“And in the struggle, the revolver fell from my muff and exploded on"
the floor.
“At once he was aflame with suspicion.
"“‘So—it’s murder you want!’ he shouted. ‘Well, murder it shall be!’"
“I saw death in his eye as he seized my arm. I was defenseless now. The
old passion came over him. Before he killed—he—would have his way with
me.
“I screamed. With a wild effort I twisted away from him.
"“He raised his hand to strike me, I saw his eyes, glassy. Then he sank"
back—fell to the floor—dead of apoplexy—dead of his furious emotions.
"That added the last straw. She took two steps to the table, and"
"sitting down blindly, covered her face with her hands. Her shoulders"
"began to tremble, her head sank lower and lower on the table. Her"
pride was gone.
'Heaven help us!' she whispered in a passion of grief. 'Heaven help
"us, for there is no help here!'"
"'That is better,' he said, eyeing her coldly. 'We shall soon come to"
terms now.'
In his exultation he went a step nearer to her. He was about to touch
"her--to lay his hand on her hair, believing his evil victory won, when"
suddenly two dark figures rose like shadows behind her chair. He
"recoiled, dropping his hand. In a moment a pistol barrel was thrust"
into his face. He fell back another step.
'One word and you are a dead man!' a stern voice hissed in his ear.
"Then he saw another barrel gleam in the lamplight, and he stood still."
"'What is this?' he said, looking from one to the other, his voice"
trembling with rage.
'Justice!' the same speaker answered harshly. 'But stand still and be
"silent, and you shall have your life. Give the alarm, and you die,"
"general, though we die the next minute. Sit down in that chair.'"
"He hesitated. But the two shining barrels converging on his head, the"
"two grim faces behind them, were convincing; in a moment he obeyed."
"We went down into the road on foot, a little party of nine--four women"
"and five men. The horsemen, as they came up, looked at us in wonder."
"Our clothes, even my lady's, were dyed with mud and torn in a score of"
"places. We had not washed for days, and our faces were lean with"
famine. Some of the women were shoeless and had their hair about their
"ears, while Steve was bare-headed and bare-armed, and looked so huge a"
ruffian the stocks must have yawned for him anywhere. They drew up and
"gazed at us, and then Count Hugo came riding down the column and saw"
us.
"My lady went forward a step. 'Count Leuchtenstein,' she said, her"
"voice breaking; she had only seen him once, and then under the mask of"
"a plain name. But he was safety, honour, life now, and I think that"
she could have kissed him. I think for a little she could have fallen
into his arms.
"'Countess!' he said, as he sprang from his horse in wonder. 'Is it"
really you? Gott im Himmel! These are strange times. Waldgrave! Your
pardon. Ach! Have you come on foot?'
"'Not I. But these brave men have,' my lady answered, tears in her"
voice.
He looked at Steve and grunted. Then he looked at me and his eyes
lightened. 'Are these all your party?' he said hurriedly.
"'All,' my lady answered in a low voice. He did not ask farther, but he"
"sighed, and I knew that he had looked for his child. 'I came north"
"upon a reconnaissance, and was about to turn,' he said. 'I am thankful"
that I did not turn before. Is Tzerclas in pursuit of you?'
"mother used to, and lifted her eyes... Oh, _madam_!"
"When Harry came I had his letters all ready, and the ring and a ducky"
"little brooch he’d given me—a silver bird it was, with a chain in its"
"beak, and on the end of the chain a heart with a dagger. Quite the"
thing! I opened the door to him. I never gave him time for a word.
"“There you are,” I said. “Take them all back,” I said, “it’s all over."
"I’m not going to marry you,” I said, “I can’t leave my lady.” White! he"
"turned as white as a woman. I had to slam the door, and there I stood,"
"all of a tremble, till I knew he had gone. When I opened the"
"door—believe me or not, madam—that man _was_ gone! I ran out into the"
"road just as I was, in my apron and my house-shoes, and there I stayed"
in the middle of the road... staring. People must have laughed if they
saw me....
... Goodness gracious!—What’s that? It’s the clock striking! And here
"I’ve been keeping you awake. Oh, madam, you ought to have stopped"
"me.... Can I tuck in your feet? I always tuck in my lady’s feet, every"
"night, just the same. And she says, “Good night, Ellen. Sleep sound and"
"wake early!” I don’t know what I should do if she didn’t say that, now."
"... Oh dear, I sometimes think... whatever should I do if anything were"
"to.... But, there, thinking’s no good to anyone—is it, madam? Thinking"
won’t help. Not that I do it often. And if ever I do I pull myself up
"sharp, “Now, then, Ellen. At it again—you silly girl! If you can’t find"
anything better to do than to start thinking!...”
'What is it?' I asked without curiosity.
"'A little boy gave it to me at the door,' he answered. 'I was to ask"
you to be in the street opposite Herr Krapp's half an hour after
sunset this evening.'
I gasped. 'Herr Krapp's!' I exclaimed.
"Steve nodded, looking at me queerly. 'Yes; do you know him?' he said."
"'I do now,' I muttered, gulping down my amazement. But my face was as"
"red as fire, the blood drummed in my ears. I had to turn away to hide"
my emotion. 'What was the boy like?' I asked.
But it seemed that the lad had made off the moment he had done his
"errand, and Steve had not noticed him particularly. 'I called after"
"him to know who sent him,' he added, 'but he had gone too far.'"
"I nodded and mumbled something, and went on into the house. Perhaps I"
"was still a little sore on my girl's account, and resented the easy"
"way in which she had dropped out of others' lives. At any rate, my"
"instinct was to keep the thing to myself. The face at the window, and"
"then this strange assignation, could have only one meaning; but, good"
"or bad, it was for me. And I hugged myself on it, and said nothing"
even to my lady.
"The day seemed long, but at length the evening came, and when the"
"men had gone to drill and the house was quiet, I slipped out. The"
streets were full at this hour of men passing to and fro to their
"drill-stations, and of women who had been out to see the camp, and"
were returning before the gates closed. The bells of many of the
"pointed, scriggly hand, ""To my little friend.--E. H.""  Fiorsen drew smoke"
"deep down into his lungs, expelled it slowly, and went to the piano.  He"
"opened it and began to play, staring vacantly before him, the cigarette"
"burned nearly to his lips.  He went on, scarcely knowing what he played."
"At last he stopped, and sat dejected.  A great artist?  Often, nowadays,"
he did not care if he never touched a violin again.  Tired of standing up
"before a sea of dull faces, seeing the blockheads knock their silly hands"
"one against the other!  Sick of the sameness of it all! Besides--besides,"
were his powers beginning to fail?  What was happening to him of late?
"He got up, went into the dining-room, and drank some brandy.  Gyp could"
"not bear his drinking.  Well, she shouldn't be out so much--taking"
music-lessons.  Music-lessons!  Nearly three o'clock.  If he went for
"once and saw what she really did--Went, and offered her his escort home!"
"An attention.  It might please her.  Better, anyway, than waiting here"
until she chose to come in with her face all closed up.  He drank a
little more brandy--ever so little--took his hat and went.  Not far to
"walk, but the sun was hot, and he reached the house feeling rather dizzy."
A maid-servant opened the door to him.
"""I am Mr. Fiorsen.  Mrs. Fiorsen here?"""
"""Yes, sir; will you wait?"""
Why did she look at him like that?  Ugly girl!  How hateful ugly people
"were!  When she was gone, he reopened the door of the waiting-room, and"
listened.
Chopin!  The polonaise in A flat.  Good!  Could that be Gyp?  Very good!
"He moved out, down the passage, drawn on by her playing, and softly"
turned the handle.  The music stopped.  He went in.
"As De Grammont was leaving my closet, he paused at the door, and, after a"
"moment's hesitancy, whispered:--"
"""You may expect a letter from France soon. It will come from M. l'Abbé du"
"Boise, who I hope will come soon to London on the business of my king."
"You know him not--M. l'Abbé?"" The eyebrows lifted questioningly. ""No? You"
"soon will know him, yet you will not know him. You and perhaps a lady may"
"help him in his mission. I, too, shall help him, but I, too, know him"
"not. Yet I know him. If he succeed in his mission, he will be rich, he"
"will be powerful. And I? Mon Dieu, my friend! If he succeed, my decree of"
banishment from Paris--it will be to revoke. I may return once more to
bask in the smile of my king. You must not speak; the lady must not
"speak; I must not speak when Monsieur l'Abbé comes, nor before. It is to"
"silence. Stone walls have one ear."""
"""Two, sometimes, count,"" I suggested, laughing."
"""Yes, I should have said one ears! Non, non! I forget this damnable"
"tongue of yours! When I arrive to great interest, it is to talk faster"
"than it is to think, and--"" A shrug of the shoulders finished the"
sentence.
"""Let us speak French hereafter, my dear count,"" I suggested."
"""Mon Dieu, mon Dieu! It is to me more of pain to hear my sweet language"
"murdered than to murder yours,"" answered Grammont, seriously."
"""Ah, but I speak French quite as well as I speak English. Perhaps I shall"
"not murder it,"" I replied."
"""Perhaps? We shall try,"" he said, though with little show of faith."
Travers nodded.
"""I heard you talking, but I wanted to make sure. It has all been my"
fault--every bit of it. It's decent of you not to make me feel it
"more. You are not to blame--her. You know I tempted her, I made her"
"help me. She isn't responsible. At any rate, she made a clean breast"
of it--that's something to her credit. I didn't want to--I never meant
to. I am not the sort that repents. But this last week you have been
"so decent, and Lois such a plucky little soul--she ought to hate"
"me--and perhaps she does--but she has done her best. Nicholson, are"
you listening? Can you hear what I say? It's so damned hard for me to
"talk."""
"""I can hear,"" Nicholson said kindly. ""Don't worry about what can't be"
"helped."" In spite of everything, he pitied the man, and his tone"
showed it.
"Travers lifted himself higher, clinging to the other's shoulder. His"
"voice began to come in rough, uneven jerks."
"""But it can be helped--it must be helped! Don't you see--I came"
between you and Lois purposely. From the first moment you spoke of her
I knew that you loved her--and I wanted her. I never gave your
message. I didn't dare. You are the sort of man a woman cares for--a
"woman like Lois. I couldn't risk it. But now--well, I'm done, and"
"afterward she will be free--"""
Nicholson drew back stiffly.
"""You are talking nonsense,"" he said, in a colder tone. ""No one wants"
"you to die--and in any case, you know very well we have no chance of"
"getting through this alive."""
"'ear?  But when I sent you, what use was you?  I released 'Art, who's"
repaid me by bein' unable to see an 'ole in a ladder; and I've
concluded a treaty of peace and friendship with the French.  Next
time (if so be a German ship comes ashore) I'll go out as my own
"hambassador.  No, Simcox, never more!  No, Lampert, never, never"
"more!  I just speaks to that French crowd, and they are civil and"
drink fair.  They recognised they'd met their match.  Their skipper
"says, says he, 'Captain Jones, I owns fair and square I'm not your"
"ekal at diplomatics.'  He adds, moreover, 'Captain Jones, damn me if"
"I believe your match is to be found.'  And I says, with dignity (with"
"dignity, Simcox), 'Right you are!'  That's what I says.  And as for"
"you, you ratty galoots, you'll treat 'em when you meets 'em just the"
same as if they wasn't French.  Do you 'ear me?  That's my
"hultimatum.  Now you can go.  That'll do the watch."""
He turned to the mates.
"""I thought better of you two, so I did,"" he remarked sadly.  ""But"
"there, you 'aven't 'ad my experience, and when I gets 'ome I shall"
see as them that is in power at the Furrin Office 'ears 'ow I done
"it.  Salisbury ain't my stiffness of backbone, and 'e ain't my tact."
"If so be as 'e was to invite them Frenchmen to dinner, it would be"
different.  They knows (as the French captain owned to me; fair and
square 'e owned it) they don't 'ave no nat'ral right to hislands and
col'nies.  Make the Frenchmen's 'omes 'appy and they'll stay at 'ome.
"Think it hout; you'll see 'ow it could be done.  There now, that'll"
"do you.  I disarrest you!"""
"And the ""old man"" rolled cheerfully for his cabin."
"""By my lone I done it!"" said the Guffin."
"answer, wishing to understand him."
"""Speak to me from the Bible.  There are no such men there."""
"Then the teacher began criticising the Bible.  The old man listened,"
and interrupted him after a long while.
"""Stop ...  Wait!  That means that among people known to God there are"
no Russians?  We are not known to God?  Is it so?  God knew all those
"who are mentioned in the Bible ... He destroyed them by sword and fire,"
He destroyed their cities; but He also sent prophets to teach them.
That means that He also pitied them.  He scattered the Jews and the
"Tartars ...  But what about us?  Why have we prophets no longer?"""
"""Well, I don't know!"" replied the teacher, trying to understand the old"
"man.  But the latter put his hand on the teacher's shoulder, and slowly"
"pushed him backwards and forwards, and his throat made a noise as if he"
were swallowing something....
"""Tell me!  You speak so much ... as if you knew everything.  It makes"
me sick to listen to you ... you darken my soul....  I should be better
"pleased if you were silent.  Who are we, eh? Why have we no prophets?"
"Ha, ha! ...  Where were we when Christ walked on this earth?  Do you"
"see?  And you too, you are lying....  Do you think that all die out?"
The Russian people will never disappear....  You are lying....  It has
"been written in the Bible, only it is not known what name the Russians"
are given.  Do you see what kind of people they are?  They are
numberless....  How many villages are there on the earth? Think of all
"the people who live on it, so strong, so numerous! And you say that"
"they will die out; men shall die, but God wants the people, God the"
Creator of the earth!  The Amalekites did not die out.  They are either
"German or French....  But you, eh, you!  Now then, tell me why we are"
"In the streets, the lamps were lighted, but daylight was not quite gone."
"He walked unsteadily, toward Piccadilly.  A girl of the town passed and"
"looked up at him.  Staring hard, he hooked his arm in hers without a"
"word; it steadied him, and they walked on thus together.  Suddenly he"
said:
"""Well, girl, are you happy?""  The girl stopped and tried to disengage her"
arm; a rather frightened look had come into her dark-eyed powdered face.
"Fiorsen laughed, and held it firm.  ""When the unhappy meet, they walk"
together.  Come on!  You are just a little like my wife.  Will you have a
"drink?"""
"The girl shook her head, and, with a sudden movement, slipped her arm out"
of this madman's and dived away like a swallow through the pavement
traffic.  Fiorsen stood still and laughed with his head thrown back.  The
second time to-day.  SHE had slipped from his grasp.  Passers looked at
"him, amazed.  The ugly devils!  And with a grimace, he turned out of"
"Piccadilly, past St. James's Church, making for Bury Street.  They"
"wouldn't let him in, of course--not they!  But he would look at the"
"windows; they had flower-boxes--flower-boxes!  And, suddenly, he groaned"
aloud--he had thought of Gyp's figure busy among the flowers at home.
"Missing the right turning, he came in at the bottom of the street.  A"
fiddler in the gutter was scraping away on an old violin.  Fiorsen
"stopped to listen.  Poor devil!  ""Pagliacci!""  Going up to the man--dark,"
"lame, very shabby, he took out some silver, and put his other hand on the"
man's shoulder.
"""Brother,"" he said, ""lend me your fiddle.  Here's money for you. Come;"
"lend it to me.  I am a great violinist."""
"""Vraiment, monsieur!"""
"The android advanced with his knife raised. In desperation, Taber fired"
at the lethal fist that held the weapon. And he was lucky. The hand
snapped open under the ripping impact of the bullet and the knife rang
sharply against the wall as it ricocheted to the ground.
"Only then, did the patrolman obey the order to drop. He went to one knee"
and Brent Taber fired three shots into the chest of the android.
He hesitated. There was only one slug left in the revolver. If the three
"didn't spot the android, he planned to wait for closer contact and put"
the sixth slug into the forehead.
The android shuddered. The fire and frenzy went out of him. He tried to
lift a leg and was surprised when it didn't move. He looked down at it.
"Completely bemused, he peered down at his crimson chest. He looked up at"
"Taber without anger, only with surprise. A distinct expression of"
wistful regret crossed his face as he sank to the ground.
The tenth android was dead.
The patrolman came shakily to his feet. His face was as pale as death.
"""I--I don't know what happened. Buck fever. Pure buck fever, and I've"
"been on the force for ten years."""
"""Don't worry about it,"" Taber said."
"""Don't _worry_. All of a sudden I freeze under pressure and he says,"
"'Don't worry.'"""
"""I meant it. This is no ordinary man. It wasn't buck fever at all. I"
couldn't have faced him myself if I hadn't rattled him with that lucky
"No one spoke, and I looked from one to another. The men had returned"
"from the search, and stood in a dark group round the body, which they"
"had drawn to the side of the road. It wanted an hour of daylight yet,"
"and I could not see their faces, but I read in their silence the"
answer that no one liked to put into words.
"'Be a man!' Steve muttered, after a long pause. 'God help the girl."
But God help us too if we are found here!'
"Still my lady did not speak, and I knew her brave heart too well to"
"doubt her, though she had been the first to talk of going. 'Get to"
"horse,' I said roughly."
"'No, no,' my lady cried at last. 'We will all stay, Martin.'"
"'Ay, all stay or all go!' Steve muttered."
"'Then all go!' I said, choking down the sobs that would rise. And I"
turned first from the place.
I will not try to state what that cost me. I saw my girl's face
"everywhere--everywhere in the darkness, and the eyes reproached me."
"That she of all should suffer, who had never fainted, never faltered,"
whose patience and courage had been the women's stay from the
"first--that she should suffer! I thought of the tender, weak body, and"
"of all the things that might happen to her, and I seemed, as I went"
"away from her, the vilest thing that lived."
But reason was against me. If I stayed there and waited on the road
"by the old crone's body until morning, what could I do? Whither could"
I turn? Marie was gone and already might be half a dozen miles away.
"So the bonds of custom and duty held me. Dazed and bewildered, I"
gallants. But it may not be.  I may not give you such a right. A maiden
is not free to choose her friends; and the knights of chivalry are long
"since vanished from the earth.  I would that I might call you friend,"
that sometimes we might meet and hold converse together. I trust that I
"may learn a good report of you, that one day I may speak with pride of"
having known you in your youth.  But that must suffice us.  Let it be
"enough for both.  I may not—"""
"She hesitated, and her voice died into silence. She spoke with a"
repressed emotion which he scarcely understood.  The tumult of his own
heart was such that he could not seek to gauge the depths of her
feelings.
"""If I may not be your knight, let me at least be your friend—your"
"servant!"" he pleaded.  ""And if there is anything wherein I can serve"
"you—"""
She seemed struck by the phrase.  She lifted her bent head and gazed
earnestly at him; but the words she spoke seemed strange.
"""You are the friend of Lord Sandford; is it not so?"""
"""I have been his comrade these many weeks.  He has shown me much"
"kindness and good-fellowship. I owe him gratitude."""
"""And you must know him well, I doubt not.  Tell me, Sir Grey—and I pray"
you deceive me not—what kind of a man is this same Lord Sandford?  Is he
"leal and true, faithful, loving, and loyal?  Is he better than the crowd"
"who follow at his heels and ape his manners, use his name as a"
"watchword, and fawn upon his favour?  Tell me, what think you of him?  A"
"friend must needs speak sooth."""
"""The Rajah has a charmed life,"" he said somberly. ""He is always in the"
front of his men--we can recognize him by his dress and figure--he is
"always within range, but we can't hit him. Not that I ought to wish"
"his death, though it's our only chance."" He put his hands distractedly"
"to his head. ""Heaven knows, it's too hard for a Christian man! Every"
"time I see an enemy fall, I rejoice--and then I remember that it is my"
"brother--"" He stopped, the expression on his face of profound trouble"
"giving way to active alarm. ""Hush! Some one is coming!"""
"A second time the door opened, and Travers rushed in. Lois saw his"
"face, and something in her recoiled in sick disgust. Fear, an almost"
"imbecilic fear, was written on the wide-open, staring eyes, and the"
hand that held the revolver trembled like that of an old man.
"""Quick--out by the back way!"" he stammered incoherently. ""I will lock"
the door--so. That will keep them off a minute. They are bound to look
for us here first. Nicholson is retiring with his men--they are going
to have a try to bring down the Rajah. It's our one chance. It may
"frighten the devils--they think he's a god. I believe he is, curse"
"him!"" All the time, he had been piling furniture against the door with"
"a mad and feverish energy. ""Help me! Help me!"" he screamed. ""Why don't"
"you help? Do you want to be killed like sheep?"""
Lois drew him back by the arm.
"""You are wasting time,"" she said firmly. ""Come with us! Why, you are"
"hurt!"""
He looked at the thin stream which trickled down the soiled white of
his coat. A silly smile flickered over his big face.
abandoned by God?  Have we no punishments nor prophets from the Lord?
"Who then will teach us?"" Tyapa spoke strongly and plainly, and there"
"was faith in his words.  He had been speaking a long time, and the"
"teacher, who was generally drunk and in a speechless condition, could"
"not stand it any longer.  He looked at the dry, wrinkled old man, felt"
"the great force of these words, and suddenly began to pity himself.  He"
wished to say something so strong and convincing to the old man that
Tyapa would be disposed in his favour; he did not wish to speak in such
"a serious, earnest way, but in a soft and fatherly tone.  And the"
teacher felt as if something were rising from his breast into his
throat ...  But he could not find any powerful words.
"""What kind of a man are you? ...  Your soul seems to be torn away--and"
you still continue speaking ... as if you knew something ...  It would
"be better if you were silent."""
"""Ah, Tyapa, what you say is true,"" replied the teacher, sadly. ""The"
people ... you are right ... they are numberless ... but I am a
stranger to them ... and they are strangers to me ... Do you see where
the tragedy of my life is hidden? ... But let me alone!  I shall suffer
"... and there are no prophets also ...  No.  You are right, I speak a"
great deal ...  But it is no good to anyone.  I shall be always silent
"...  Only don't speak with me like this ...  Ah, old man, you do not"
"know ...  You do not know ...  And you cannot understand."""
"And in the end the teacher cried.  He cried so easily and so freely,"
"with such torrents of flowing tears, that he soon found relief."
"""You ought to go into a village ... become a clerk or a teacher ..."
"You would be well fed there.  What are you crying for?"" asked Tyapa,"
sadly.
"the water for him to fetch, this being in his view the only reason why"
anything was carried in the hand.
"She found Monsieur Harmost fidgeting up and down the room, whose opened"
windows could not rid it of the smell of latakia.
"""Ah,"" he said, ""I thought you were not coming!  You look pale; are you"
"not well?  Is it the heat?  Or""--he looked hard into her face--""has"
"someone hurt you, my little friend?""  Gyp shook her head. ""Ah, yes,"" he"
"went on irritably; ""you tell me nothing; you tell nobody nothing!  You"
"close up your pretty face like a flower at night.  At your age, my child,"
one should make confidences; a secret grief is to music as the east wind
"to the stomach.  Put off your mask for once.""  He came close to her."
"""Tell me your troubles.  It is a long time since I have been meaning to"
"ask. Come!  We are only once young; I want to see you happy."""
But Gyp stood looking down.  Would it be relief to pour her soul out?
Would it?  His brown eyes questioned her like an old dog's. She did not
want to hurt one so kind.  And yet--impossible!
Monsieur Harmost suddenly sat down at the piano.  Resting his hands on
"the keys, he looked round at her, and said:"
"""I am in love with you, you know.  Old men can be very much in love, but"
"they know it is no good--that makes them endurable. Still, we like to"
feel of use to youth and beauty; it gives us a little warmth.  Come; tell
"me your grief!""  He waited a moment, then said irritably: ""Well, well, we"
"go to music then!"""
"It was his habit to sit by her at the piano corner, but to-day he stood"
"as if prepared to be exceptionally severe.  And Gyp played, whether from"
"overexcited nerves or from not having had any lunch, better than she had"
'Where is Marie?' I cried.
She did not answer. No one answered; and I knew. Steve swore again. I
think he had known from the beginning. I began to tremble. On a sudden
my lady lifted up her voice and cried shrilly--
'Marie! Marie!'
Again no answer. But this time I did not wait to listen. I ran from
"them into the darkness the way we had come, my legs quivering under"
"me, and my mouth full of broken prayers. I remembered a certain"
"solitary tree fronting the poplars, on the other side of the way,"
"which I had marked mechanically at the moment of the fall--an ash,"
whose light upper boughs had come for an instant between my eyes and
"the sky. It stood on a little mound, where the moorland began to rise"
"on that side. I came to it now, and stopped and looked. At first I"
"could see nothing, and I trod forward fearfully. Then, a couple of"
"paces on, I made out a dark figure, lying head and feet across the"
"road. I sprang to it, and kneeling, passed my hands over it. Alas! it"
was a woman's.
"I raised the light form in my arms, crying passionately on her name,"
"while the wind swayed the boughs overhead, and, besides that and my"
"voice, all the countryside was still. She did not answer. She hung"
"limp in my arms. Kneeling in the dust beside her, I felt blindly for a"
"pulse, a heart-beat. I found neither--neither; the woman was dead."
And yet it was not that which made me lay the body down so quickly and
stand up peering round me. No; something else. The blood drummed in my
"ears, my heart beat wildly. The woman was dead; but she was not Marie."
"She was an old woman, sixty years old. When I stooped again, after"
from above.  No sound of the dogs.  He would go up and see the baby.
"While he was crossing the hall, there came a ring.  He opened the door"
himself.  A telegram!  He tore the envelope.
"""Gyp and the baby are with me letter follows.--WINTON."""
"He gave a short laugh, shut the door in the boy's face, and ran upstairs;"
why--heaven knew!  There was nobody there now!  Nobody! Did it mean that
she had really left him--was not coming back?  He stopped by the side of
"Gyp's bed, and flinging himself forward, lay across it, burying his face."
"And he sobbed, as men will, unmanned by drink.  Had he lost her?  Never"
to see her eyes closing and press his lips against them!  Never to soak
"his senses in her loveliness!  He leaped up, with the tears still wet on"
"his face. Lost her?  Absurd!  That calm, prim, devilish Englishman, her"
father--he was to blame--he had worked it all--stealing the baby!
He went down-stairs and drank some brandy.  It steadied him a little.
"What should he do?  ""Letter follows.""  Drink, and wait? Go to Bury"
Street?  No.  Drink!  Enjoy himself!
"He laughed, and, catching up his hat, went out, walking furiously at"
"first, then slower and slower, for his head began to whirl, and, taking a"
"cab, was driven to a restaurant in Soho.  He had eaten nothing but a"
"biscuit since his breakfast, always a small matter, and ordered soup and"
a flask of their best Chianti--solids he could not face.  More than two
"hours he sat, white and silent, perspiration on his forehead, now and"
"then grinning and flourishing his fingers, to the amusement and sometimes"
"the alarm of those sitting near.  But for being known there, he would"
"have been regarded with suspicion.  About half-past nine, there being no"
"more wine, he got up, put a piece of gold on the table, and went out"
without waiting for his change.
The Lady’s Maid
_Eleven o’clock. A knock at the door._
"... I hope I haven’t disturbed you, madam. You weren’t asleep—were you?"
"But I’ve just given my lady her tea, and there was such a nice cup"
"over, I thought, perhaps...."
"... Not at all, madam. I always make a cup of tea last thing. She"
drinks it in bed after her prayers to warm her up. I put the kettle on
"when she kneels down and I say to it, “Now you needn’t be in too much"
of a hurry to say _your_ prayers.” But it’s always boiling before my
"lady is half through. You see, madam, we know such a lot of people, and"
they’ve all got to be prayed for—every one. My lady keeps a list of the
names in a little red book. Oh dear! whenever some one new has been to
"see us and my lady says afterwards, “Ellen, give me my little red"
"book,” I feel quite wild, I do. “There’s another,” I think, “keeping"
"her out of her bed in all weathers.” And she won’t have a cushion, you"
"know, madam; she kneels on the hard carpet. It fidgets me something"
"dreadful to see her, knowing her as I do. I’ve tried to cheat her; I’ve"
"spread out the eiderdown. But the first time I did it—oh, she gave me"
"such a look—holy it was, madam. “Did our Lord have an eiderdown,"
"Ellen?” she said. But—I was younger at the time—I felt inclined to say,"
"“No, but our Lord wasn’t your age, and he didn’t know what it was to"
"have your lumbago.” Wicked—wasn’t it? But she’s _too_ good, you know,"
"madam. When I tucked her up just now and seen—saw her lying back, her"
hands outside and her head on the pillow—so pretty—I couldn’t help
"thinking, “Now you look just like your dear mother when I laid her"
out!”
"""Don't be afraid, Sidney,"" Mart spoke calmly. ""You sort o' belong to"
the Cape and we Cape folks don't think anything of drowning. We sort of
"expect to, sometime--"" But here her voice broke with a tremble. ""I--I"
was thinking of gran'ma. I wish I'd been better to her. I talk back to
"her lots of times when I shouldn't."""
"""But you _are_ good to her, Mart. And--_I_ was thinking of Aunt Achsa."
I shouldn't have deceived her--about coming out here. I fooled myself
into thinking that even a lie didn't matter considering what we were
trying to do. But the honor of Cape Cod isn't worth anything happening
to Lav. And if anything does happen there won't be anyone to tell about
"Jed Starrow, anyway! Oh, Mart, I can't bear to _think_ about Lav. Why"
"did we let him do it? Dear old Lav. I've been mean to him, too. He"
adores poetry and I--I never even told him that my father was a poet
and that I know lots and lots of poems and--and--that I've written most
"a book myself."""
"""Honest, Sid, was your father a poet? And you can write it yourself?"
"Gee,"" softly. ""I wish I could do something like that. I'd rather be"
like that than anything else. I just pretend that I hate school and
books and such things--it's because I had to stop going to school to
stay with gran'ma that I've put on that I didn't have any use for it.
"Even when I was sort of laughing at you, Sid, down in my heart I was"
feeling aw'fly proud that you'd want to fool 'round with anyone like
"me--I'll _always_ be proud."""
"""Oh, Mart--"" Sidney faltered. ""I wish I could put into words what Mr."
Dugald taught me when I first came here. That it's the big inside
things that really count. He told me so's I'd see Aunt Achsa and Lav as
"they really are. And, Mart, your giving up school to take care of your"
"grandmother is a big thing, a real thing! You don't want to forget it."""
the table-cloth.
... But one day I managed to get a pair of scissors and—would you
"believe it, madam? I cut off all my hair; snipped it off all in bits,"
like the little monkey I was. Grandfather was _furious_! He caught hold
of the tongs—I shall never forget it—grabbed me by the hand and shut my
fingers in them. “That’ll teach you!” he said. It was a fearful burn.
I’ve got the mark of it to-day.
"... Well, you see, madam, he’d taken such pride in my hair. He used to"
"sit me up on the counter, before the customers came, and do it"
"something beautiful—big, soft curls and waved over the top. I remember"
"the assistants standing round, and me ever so solemn with the penny"
grandfather gave me to hold while it was being done.... But he always
"took the penny back afterwards. Poor grandfather! Wild, he was, at the"
fright I’d made of myself. But he frightened me that time. Do you know
"what I did, madam? I ran away. Yes, I did, round the corners, in and"
"out, I don’t know how far I didn’t run. Oh, dear, I must have looked a"
"sight, with my hand rolled up in my pinny and my hair sticking out."
People must have laughed when they saw me....
"... No, madam, grandfather never got over it. He couldn’t bear the"
"sight of me after. Couldn’t eat his dinner, even, if I was there. So my"
"aunt took me. She was a cripple, an upholstress. Tiny! She had to stand"
on the sofas when she wanted to cut out the backs. And it was helping
her I met my lady....
"... Not so very, madam. I was thirteen, turned. And I don’t remember"
"ever feeling—well—a child, as you might say. You see there was my"
"uniform, and one thing and another. My lady put me into collars and"
cuffs from the first. Oh yes—once I did! That was—funny! It was like
this. My lady had her two little nieces staying with her—we were at
"... Yes, madam, it was all left to me. Oh, she did look sweet. I did"
"her hair, soft-like, round her forehead, all in dainty curls, and just"
to one side of her neck I put a bunch of most beautiful purple pansies.
"Those pansies made a picture of her, madam! I shall never forget them."
"I thought to-night, when I looked at my lady, “Now, if only the pansies"
was there no one could tell the difference.”
"... Only the last year, madam. Only after she’d got a"
"little—well—feeble as you might say. Of course, she was never"
dangerous; she was the sweetest old lady. But how it took her was—she
"thought she’d lost something. She couldn’t keep still, she couldn’t"
"settle. All day long she’d be up and down, up and down; you’d meet her"
"everywhere,—on the stairs, in the porch, making for the kitchen. And"
"she’d look up at you, and she’d say—just like a child, “I’ve lost it,"
"I’ve lost it.” “Come along,” I’d say, “come along, and I’ll lay out"
your patience for you.” But she’d catch me by the hand—I was a
"favourite of hers—and whisper, “Find it for me, Ellen. Find it for me.”"
"Sad, wasn’t it?"
"... No, she never recovered, madam. She had a stroke at the end. Last"
"words she ever said was—very slow, “Look in—the—Look—in—” And then she"
was gone.
"... No, madam, I can’t say I noticed it. Perhaps some girls. But you"
"see, it’s like this, I’ve got nobody but my lady. My mother died of"
"consumption when I was four, and I lived with my grandfather, who kept"
a hair-dresser’s shop. I used to spend all my time in the shop under a
"table dressing my doll’s hair—copying the assistants, I suppose. They"
"were ever so kind to me. Used to make me little wigs, all colours, the"
"latest fashions and all. And there I’d sit all day, quiet as quiet—the"
customers never knew. Only now and again I’d take my peep from under
"""So it is, after all, a bargain that you offer me!"" he said. ""You are"
"trying to save them. You offer a high price, but I am not a merchant."
"I can not buy you, Beatrice."""
"""It is not a bargain!"" For the first time she faltered, taken aback by"
"the pitiless logic of his words. ""Can't you see that? Can't you see"
"that, however much I loved you, I could not act otherwise than implore"
you to turn back from a step that means destruction for those bound to
"me by blood and country? Could I do less?"""
"""No,"" he said slowly."
She held out her hands to him.
"""Oh, Nehal, turn back while there is yet time! For my sake, for yours,"
"for us all, turn back from a bloody, cruel revenge. The power is"
"yours. Be generous. If we have wronged you, we have suffered and are"
"ready to atone. _I_ am ready to atone. I _can_ atone, because I love"
you. I have spoken the truth to you. I have laid my soul bare to you
"as I have done to no other being. Won't you trust me?"""
"His eyes met hers with a somber, hopeless significance which cut her"
to the heart.
"""I can't,"" he said. ""I can't. That is what you have taught me--to"
"distrust you--and every one."""
"She stood silent now, paralyzed by the finality of his words and"
gesture. It was as though the shadow of her heartless folly had risen
"before her and become an iron wall of unrelenting, measured"
retribution against which she beat herself in vain. He lifted his head
"higher, seeming to gather together his shaken powers of self-control."
"gone in."""
"I stand there waiting to be at hand, to rush in to the rescue, for after"
"all I am a human being, not a brute. Several minutes pass. He has not even"
"bothered to be very quiet, for I hear him clicking the key in the lock."
"Surely I ought to hear a cry now? I hear nothing, nothing; a chair"
"scraping across the floor, that is all."
"""But good heavens, he may do her some harm! He may injure her; he may"
overpower her with rape! Ought I not to tap on the window? I--what for?
"But at the very first cry, I shall be on the spot, take my word for it."""
Not a single cry.
The hours pass; I have settled down to wait. Of course I cannot go my way
and desert a helpless woman. But the hours wear on. A very thorough
"business in there, nothing niggardly about this; it is almost dawn. It"
"occurs to me that he may be killing her, perhaps has killed her already; I"
am alarmed and about to get up--when the key clicks in the lock again and
"Solem emerges. He does not run, but walks back the way he came, down to"
the veranda of my own house. There he hangs the actor's raincoat where it
"hung before, and emerges again. But this time he is naked. He has been"
naked under the coat all this time. Is it possible? Why not? No
"inhibitions, no restraint, no covering; Solem has thought it all out. Now,"
"stark naked, he stalks to his room."
What a man!
I sit thinking and collecting myself and regaining my wits. What has
"happened? The south wing is still wrapped in silence, but the lady is not"
"dead; I can see that from Solem's fearless manner as he goes to his room,"
"lights the lamp, and goes to bed."
thought that she might go to the arms of another man made him put down
his violin with a feeling of actual sickness.  Why not?  That deep and
fearful whipping of the sexual instinct which makes the ache of jealousy
so truly terrible was at its full in such a nature as Fiorsen's.  He drew
"a long breath and shuddered.  The remembrance of her fastidious pride,"
"her candour, above all her passivity cut in across his fear.  No, not"
Gyp!
"He went to a little table whereon stood a tantalus, tumblers, and a"
"syphon, and pouring out some brandy, drank.  It steadied him.  And he"
began to practise.  He took a passage from Brahms' violin concerto and
"began to play it over and over.  Suddenly, he found he was repeating the"
same flaws each time; he was not attending.  The fingering of that thing
was ghastly!  Music-lessons!  Why did she take them?  Waste of time and
"money--she would never be anything but an amateur!  Ugh!  Unconsciously,"
he had stopped playing.  Had she gone there to-day?  It was past
lunch-time.  Perhaps she had come in.
He put down his violin and went back to the house.  No sign of her! The
maid came to ask if he would lunch.  No!  Was the mistress to be in?  She
"had not said.  He went into the dining-room, ate a biscuit, and drank a"
"brandy and soda.  It steadied him.  Lighting a cigarette, he came back to"
the drawing-room and sat down at Gyp's bureau.  How tidy!  On the little
"calendar, a pencil-cross was set against to-day--Wednesday, another"
"against Friday.  What for? Music-lessons!  He reached to a pigeon-hole,"
"and took out her address-book.  ""H--Harmost, 305A, Marylebone Road,"" and"
"against it the words in pencil, ""3 P.M."""
Three o'clock.  So that was her hour!  His eyes rested idly on a little
"old coloured print of a Bacchante, with flowing green scarf, shaking a"
"tambourine at a naked Cupid, who with a baby bow and arrow in his hands,"
was gazing up at her.  He turned it over; on the back was written in a
offence had only been that of loving her.
"Fiorsen had been taken to her room, which was larger and cooler than his"
own; and the maid was standing by the side of the bed with a scared face.
Gyp signed to her to go.  He opened his eyes presently:
"""Gyp!  Oh!  Gyp!  Is it you?  The devilish, awful things I see--don't go"
"away again!  Oh, Gyp!""  With a sob he raised himself and rested his"
forehead against her.  And Gyp felt--as on the first night he came home
drunk--a merging of all other emotions in the desire to protect and heal.
"""It's all right, all right,"" she murmured.  ""I'm going to stay. Don't"
"worry about anything.  Keep quite quiet, and you'll soon be well."""
"In a quarter of an hour, he was asleep.  His wasted look went to her"
"heart, and that expression of terror which had been coming and going"
until he fell asleep!  Anything to do with the brain was so horrible!
Only too clear that she must stay--that his recovery depended on her.
"She was still sitting there, motionless, when the doctor came, and,"
"seeing him asleep, beckoned her out.  He looked a kindly man, with two"
"waistcoats, the top one unbuttoned; and while he talked, he winked at Gyp"
"involuntarily, and, with each wink, Gyp felt that he ripped the veil off"
one more domestic secret.  Sleep was the ticket--the very ticket for him!
Had something on his mind--yes!  And--er--a little given to--brandy?  Ah!
all that must stop!  Stomach as well as nerves affected.  Seeing
things--nasty things--sure sign.  Perhaps not a very careful life before
marriage.  And married--how long?  His kindly appreciative eyes swept Gyp
"from top to toe.  Year and a half!  Quite so!  Hard worker at his violin,"
too?  No doubt!  Musicians always a little inclined to be immoderate--too
much sense of beauty--burn the candle at both ends!  She must see to
"that.  She had been away, had she not--staying with her father?  Yes."
But--no one like a wife for nursing.  As to treatment?  Well!  One would
"back of her hand with a most unchildlike gesture, and forthwith"
concealed it in her silken _faja_. Then she laid her hand once more on
the Sergeant's arm.
"""You will lead us, will you not, José Maria?"" she said pleadingly. ""I"
can trust you. You have done many great deeds. My nurse was a woman of
Ronda and told me of your exploits on the road from Madrid to Sevilla.
You will lead us to-night. Only you must leave these three in the palace
"to me. If you will, you shall have also my share of the plunder. But"
"what do I say, I know you are too noble to think only of that--as these"
"wolves do!"""
She cast a haughty glance around upon the gipsies at their card-play.
"""I, that am of Old Castile and noble by four descents, have demeaned"
"myself to mix with _Gitanos_,"" she said, ""but it has only been that I"
might work out my revenge. I told Pépe there of my plan. I showed him
"the way. He was afraid. He told ten men, and they were afraid. Fifty,"
"and they were afraid. Now there are a hundred and more, and were it not"
"that they know that all lies open and unguarded, even I could not lead"
"them thither. But they will follow you, because you are José Maria of"
"Ronda."" The Sergeant took the girl's hand in his. She was shaking as"
"with an ague fit, but her eyes, blue and mild as a summer sky, had that"
within them which was deadlier than the tricksome slippery demon that
"lurks in all black orbs, whether masculine or feminine."
"""Chica,"" he said, ""your wrongs are indeed bitter. I would give much to"
help you to set the balance right. Perhaps I may do so yet. But I cannot
be the commander of these men. They are not of my folk or country. They
have not even asked me to lead them. They are jealous of me! You see it
"as well as I!"""
"Fiorsen, who had leaped out of bed, put his hand to his head.  The cursed"
"fellow!  Cursed be every one of them--the father and the girl, Rosek and"
all the other sharks!  He went out on to the landing.  The house was
"quite still below.  Rosek had gone--good riddance!  He called, ""Gyp!""  No"
answer.  He went into her room. Its superlative daintiness struck his
fancy.  A scent of cyclamen! He looked out into the garden.  There was
"the baby at the end, and that fat woman.  No Gyp!  Never in when she was"
"wanted.  Wagge!  He shivered; and, going back into his bedroom, took a"
brandy-bottle from a locked cupboard and drank some.  It steadied him; he
"locked up the cupboard again, and dressed."
"Going out to the music-room, he stopped under the trees to make passes"
with his fingers at the baby.  Sometimes he felt that it was an adorable
"little creature, with its big, dark eyes so like Gyp's. Sometimes it"
"excited his disgust--a discoloured brat.  This morning, while looking at"
"it, he thought suddenly of the other that was coming--and grimaced."
Catching Betty's stare of horrified amazement at the face he was making
"at her darling, he burst into a laugh and turned away into the"
music-room.
"While he was keying up his violin, Gyp's conduct in never having come"
there for so long struck him as bitterly unjust.  The girl--who cared
about the wretched girl?  As if she made any real difference!  It was all
"so much deeper than that.  Gyp had never loved him, never given him what"
"he wanted, never quenched his thirst of her!  That was the heart of it."
No other woman he had ever had to do with had been like that--kept his
thirst unquenched. No; he had always tired of them before they tired of
him.  She gave him nothing really--nothing!  Had she no heart or did she
give it elsewhere?  What was that Paul had said about her music-lessons?
"And suddenly it struck him that he knew nothing, absolutely nothing, of"
where she went or what she did.  She never told him anything.
"Music-lessons?  Every day, nearly, she went out, was away for hours.  The"
much in all my life and I implored him not to report me. I don't
"remember what happened next, I was in such a state. But he did report"
me. I got a court martial and was sentenced to death for sleeping at my
post. They put me into the guard-room and I expected to be shot the next
"day. It was a rotten feeling, I can tell you. I didn't think about"
myself so much as about the wife and the little boy. I wouldn't go
through a night like that again for anything. But I went to sleep all
the same. I woke up the next morning when someone came into the
"guard-room. I didn't know where I was for a second or two, and then in a"
flash I realized I'd got to die. I don't mind admitting that I rested my
face against the wall and blubbered like a kid. Anyone would have done
"the same, I don't care what you say. But the man who'd just come in"
said:
"""'Pull yourself together, old chap--you're all right for to-day,"
anyhow.' I sat bolt upright and stared at him.
"""'They're not going to shoot me?'"
"""'Not to-day,' he answered. 'Cheer up, all sorts of things might happen"
before to-morrow.'
"""The joy I felt was so big that I can't tell you how big it was. But I"
soon felt miserable again. I couldn't understand what had happened. I
didn't know whether I was going to die or live. The uncertainty became
so terrible that I wished I'd been shot that morning--all would have
"been over then. They brought me a meal, but I couldn't eat. I asked"
"them what was going to happen, but they didn't know. Another night came,"
"but I didn't get any sleep at all. I lay tossing about on my bed, now"
"hoping, now despairing. I thought of home mostly, but once or twice I"
thought of the kids in the school where I taught--to die like this after
"the send-off they gave me! Still, they wouldn't know, they'd think I was"
Sheldon at the time—and there was a fair on the common.
"“Now, Ellen,” she said, “I want you to take the two young ladies for a"
ride on the donkeys.” Off we went; solemn little loves they were; each
had a hand. But when we came to the donkeys they were too shy to go on.
So we stood and watched instead. Beautiful those donkeys were! They
were the first I’d seen out of a cart—for pleasure as you might say.
"They were a lovely silver-grey, with little red saddles and blue"
bridles and bells jing-a-jingling on their ears. And quite big
"girls—older than me, even—were riding them, ever so gay. Not at all"
"common, I don’t mean, madam, just enjoying themselves. And I don’t know"
"what it was, but the way the little feet went, and the eyes—so"
gentle—and the soft ears—made me want to go on a donkey more than
anything in the world!
"... Of course, I couldn’t. I had my young ladies. And what would I have"
looked like perched up there in my uniform? But all the rest of the day
it was donkeys—donkeys on the brain with me. I felt I should have burst
if I didn’t tell some one; and who was there to tell? But when I went
"to bed—I was sleeping in Mrs. James’s bedroom, our cook that was, at"
"the time—as soon as the lights was out, there they were, my donkeys,"
"jingling along, with their neat little feet and sad eyes.... Well,"
"madam, would you believe it, I waited for a long time and pretended to"
"be asleep, and then suddenly I sat up and called out as loud as I"
"could, “_I do want to go on a donkey. I do want a donkey-ride!_” You"
"see, I had to say it, and I thought they wouldn’t laugh at me if they"
knew I was only dreaming. Artful—wasn’t it? Just what a silly child
would think....
"... No, madam, never now. Of course, I did think of it at one time. But"
it wasn’t to be. He had a little flower-shop just down the road and
across from where we was living. Funny—wasn’t it? And me such a one for
"""Tell it straight,"" interrupted Cherry. ""They don't understand you."""
"""Well, there ain't any Pullmans running to this resort, so I stow away"
"on a coal-burner, but somebody flags me. Then I try to hire out as a"
"fisherman, but I ain't there with the gang talk and my stuff drags, so"
I fix it for a hide-away on _The Blessed Isle_--that's her name. Can
"you beat that for a monaker? This sailor of mine goes good to grub me,"
"but he never shows for forty-eight hours--or years, I forget which."
"Anyhow, I stand it as long as I can, then I dig my way up to a hatch"
"and mew like a house-cat. It seems they were hep from the start, and"
"battened me down on purpose, then made book on how long I'd stay hid."
"Oh, it's a funny joke, and they all get a stomach laugh when I show."
When I offer to pay my way they're insulted. Nix! that ain't their
"graft. They wouldn't take money from a stranger. Oh, no! They permit me"
"to _work_ my way. The scullion has quit, see? So they promote me to his"
"job. It's the only job I ever held, and I held it because it wouldn't"
"let go of me, savvy? There's only three hundred men aboard _The Blessed"
"Isle_, so all I have to do, regular, is to understudy the cooks, carry"
"the grub, wait on table, wash the dishes, mop the floors, make the"
"officers' beds, peel six bushels of potatoes a day, and do the laundry."
"Then, of course, there's some odd tasks. Oh, it was a swell job--more"
"like a pastime. When a mop sees me coming now it dances a hornpipe, and"
I can't look a dish-rag in the face. All I see in my dreams is
"potato-parings and meat-rinds. I've got dish-water in my veins, and the"
whole universe looks greasy to me. Naturally it was my luck to pick the
"slowest ship in the harbor. We lay three weeks in the ice, that's all,"
"and nobody worked but me and the sea-gulls."""
"""You deserted this morning, eh?"""
"""I did. I beat the barrier, and now I want a bath and some clean"
clothes and a whole lot of sleep. You don't need to disturb me till

- I'd say 300.
- Let's have a look.
"No, sorry."
This wonderful casserole set costs 499 marks.
"Sorry, Hilde."
Better luck next time.
Otto.
Don't take it so hard.
- Bye.
- Bye.
I'm going over there.
Take care of him.
I saw him applauding.
- What's your name?
- Rene.
"Oh, yes."
I'm Laura.
- You work at the movie theater?
- Yeah.
- You're the... what's it called?
- Projectionist.
"Yeah, right."
- Don't do it.
- What?
Don't ask me.
Ask you what?
- Whether I liked it.
- I wasn't going to.
"Well, did you like it?"
"Yeah, it was really good."
"I thought so, too..."
You alright?
Yeah.
Okay.
Where is she?
This way.
Hey baby.
Hi.
Hey.
Hey.
You okay?
Yeah?
You're okay.
Okay.
Everything's gonna be alright.
"Oh god, what would I do without you?"
"C'mon, daddy's got you."
Let's get outta Zurich.
Not yet.
We got one more thing to do.
Damn it.
Jacob?
Jared.
"What's goin' on, buddy?"
Where are you?
Turn around.
"This isn't working out the way you wanted, is it?"
Let's go in the church.
You need to repent.
Keep going.
"You probably don't go to church much, do you?"
What the fuck is this all about?
How about Paolo?
"Balls deep, spearheading the whole thing."
"- Well, I like that."
- Joe:
"Yeah, we do, too."
"Now, uh, can we please get back to this Vernon situation?"
"Hmm, let me go put some clothes on first."
- He wants to put clothes on.
- A robe counts as clothes.
TTD:
"Here we go, Rick."
You got him.
- Man:
Go!
- Ricky:
You got him.
"Come on, he gained too much space."
Look at that route.
- What the hell was that?
"- One, two, three, throw."
He got it.
"He's nervous, man."
You're Ricky Jerret.
TTD:
"Off the line, got him."
Do it!
"Oh, my God."
Damn!
TTD:
Bam!
"He done, he done."
There it is.
There it is.
"London, it's our first time."
Okay?
- It's picking up on your an-- - [crying continues]
- She's picking up on our anxiety.
- I am so sick of sick!
- Okay.
- Please just get this off me.
- Okay.
Lift.
- Don't get it on my hair.
Yeah.
"I won't, I won't, I won't."
There you go.
There you go.
Okay.
We got it off.
There we go.
- And my shorts.
"- Okay, okay, okay."
Okay.
"- Oh, God."
- All right.
We got this.
- Gross.
- There we go.
There we go.
Yeah.
"There we go, baby."
There we-- [crying continues]
"- Nice, you guys."
- [infant screams]
[Wren] I can't.
I got you here!
I got you the compass!
I got the compass.
And you're just gonna leave me here to die?
"Have that beast eat me, to crush my bones?"
He's not a beast.
And you're not gonna die.
"I just need a head start, that's all."
Swan.
Swan!
Swan!
(BLADE ZINGS)
Whoa!
Wait.
What are you doing?
Just stay back.
Emma gave me 10 hours.
No!
"No, no, no!"
"What, you're just gonna leave her to die?"
Ten hours.
She may already be dead.
No...
No!
"You, stop!"
(GRUNTS)
Stop!
Stop!
- Aah!
- It was your daughter's wish.
(BOTH GRUNTING)
I don't care what you say.
- Yeah.
"- Phew, it smells."
- [boys cough]
It's some kind of a gas.
Come on.
[inhales deeply]
You ok now?
"Yes, thank you."
This is some kind of Science place.
- How'd you get here?
- It was Tony.
He was here.
I saw something!
What was it?
It's where Tony is.
I'm sure of it!
"A big, round shape."
A doughnut!
He's eating a doughnut.
No way!
Is it like a ball?
A great big ball?
- Yes.
- I know where he is.
Let's go!
"Hurry, let's go."
[Alfred bleats]
"Oh, thank you."
And thanks for everything.
"Come on, let's go."
We are about to make scientific history.
"[Letha] and some money, too, I hope."
"I'm gonna take them, because I know I'm not a very good mommy."
"I wasn't a very, very good mommy at all."
"And now I'm gonna be so, so good."
And I'm gonna take them all.
I just...
Okay.
Therapist to Room 5.
Therapist to Room 5.
Okay.
Best girl ever.
Mommy's best girl.
Hm?
Maybe I sh...
I should have just... watched you.
"Your meds, it's just..."
My med...
My meds?
My meds?
You watch my meds?
Why would you watch my...?
They're my...
"They're my meds, honey."
"They're my meds, huh?"
"They're Mommy's meds, not baby's meds, okay?"
- Yeah.
- It's my job.
My responsibility.
"Look at me, baby girl."
You don't do nothing wrong.
- Robin Joffe?
- Just a minute.
"Just a minute, all right?"
Ow!
Bill?
Is it really you?
"Well, there's only one of me in all the world."
You taught me that.
"Aw, Bill!"
What are the chances?
"About one in a krillion, Will."
KRILL 1:
"Quiet, you two."
I'm trying to sleep.
"Hey, everyone!"
It's Will!
KRILL 2:
"Wow, it's him!"
It's wee Willy Williams!
KRILL 3:
I thought he'd be taller.
He's back!
Will's back!
[KRILL CHEERING]
"Welcome home, Will."
But how did you find them?
They found me.
I was on my last nine legs.
"I was such a fool, Bill."
"Will, you're a legend."
"Those days are gone, my friend."
The carnivore is over.
No.
It's because of you we're all here.
It is?
Fine.
Other than work.
And no TV.
The TV's broken.
Then no computer.
I need the computer for school.
Then no...
No Stiles.
-What...
No Stiles?
-No Stiles!
And no more car privileges.
Give me your keys.
Give 'em to me!
For the love of God.
"-Mom, do you want me to..."
-No.
"Mom, come on, let me just..."
Mom.
Mom!
(sighs)
What is going on with you?
Is this about Allison?
(sighs)
Do you really wanna know?
Yeah.
Is this about your father?
"It is, isn't it?"
"Okay, you know what..."
We'll talk about this at home.
I'm gonna go get the car.
I'm the worst son ever.
I wanna go home.
- No.
- Why?
I have homework.
Can you call your mom to pick us up?
"""Us""?"
"Izzy, you're not messing this up for me."
Please don't.
Please come with us.
I wanna meet Ryan.
I'm going with your mom.
Yeah.
"Baby, Ryan."
"- Please, no."
"No, no, no."
- You come with me.
"And you can get a cab, right?"
You got taxi money in your pocket.
"No, no, no."
"Fine, fine."
"I'm coming, I'm coming."
"No, no, no."
"Fine, fine."
"I'm coming, I'm coming."

They busted it!
They busted it for good!
With a brick!
I wouldn't do it!
I wouldn't do it!
"Oh, don't talk, Bill!"
They wanted me to lay down!
"Look, Rick, you're not the only person with taste."
We happen to own a restaurant.
Whoa-ho!
"It's not a competition, Bob."
I didn't say it was.
Sounds like this guy wants to have a wine-off!
What?
!
Wine-off?
"Ooh, wine-off."
Wine-off.
Wine-off.
There's gonna be a wine-off.
We got a wine-off!

Too soon?
Too...

Don't.
"Yeah, just..."
My space.
I thought the train was crashing.
Sorry.
Trying to save you.
Whew.
"Okay, this is scarier than I thought."
"Uh, no big deal, Louise."
Just jump off a moving train.
Here I come.
Here I come.
Here I come.
- I'm not doing anything.
- Ohh!
Get out of the way!
Just pivot out!
Pivot... come on.
That's not gonna help you.
What do you want to do?
You tell me.
"I mean, we could do mitts."
"We could just hit the mitts, or you can learn how to fight."
Got it.
Move.
Breathe and move.
Don't cross your feet.
Turn it over.
Turn it over.

"Okay, don't apologize."
Right hand.
We watched it.
I remember.
I was so swollen.
"Ugh, I hated Detroit."
"Isiah, Laimbeer, Dumars."
But Worthy...
"James Worthy, he saved us."
Shot the lights out.
Fantastic.
You know that thing that I was trying to talk to you about?
Jimmy...
"No, I'm just saying that I took care of it."
I knew you would.
You did?
Mmm-hmm.
I can't believe I'm old enough to watch people play basketball in those shorts.
Hey Marissa.
Marissa?
Uh-oh.
I'll go.
Hey.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Come on.
You can tell me.
Hey... come here.

You can tell me.
We tell each other everything.

I'm going in.
What?
Just me.
Suitcase.
"Excuse me, sir."
"Uh, we'd like to ask you a few questions."
"Namely, what are you doing in town?"
Oh.
"So, what's troubling you is the nature of my game?"
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey."
Ohhh.
Oh my God...
I'm seeing myself as a child.
I'm seeing myself being conceived.
Uhn...
I got it worse than that.
I'm seeing the night before I was conceived.
My dad's jerking off.
"Well, this guy checks out clean."
A guy like you could never murder anyone.
That's okay.
"No, go back to your thoughts."
Changwook is still in the shower.
- Did you go to our room?
- Yes.
Keep working.
I'm going down to the beach.
Go ahead.
"Please, go ahead."
"Oh, it's Dori!"
Hello.

"Hello, Dori."
He looks like a really nice dog.
"Well, people say so."

- No need to.
He's the Jindo breed.
I see.
"Oh, you cutie."
Sorry for keeping you.
- Let's go.
"- Let's go, Dori."
"Good-bye, Dori."
- Good-bye.
- Bye.
How's this place?
It looks pretty cheap.
What's the rate?
"On weekdays 60,000 Won, 80,000 Won on weekends."
"Oh, it's cheaper here."
Would you like some tea?
"And, here's some dessert as well."
Good job!
Here I go!
Look out!

I will settle my accounts with you right now.
Sure thing!
Just look!
You have no escape.
Holmes!
"That's the spirit, Mac Bain!"
It can't be...!
I'm sorry that your engine is...
"No, it's all right."
I'm sitting right in front of you.

This is a pleasant surprise.

Not what I expected.
- My voice doesn't match my face?
CONOR:
Your voice does not match your face in a good way.
In a...
"Yeah, I mean..."
That sounded terrible.
Amazing.
I don't know how all this stuff fit in here before.
Good.

We need to speak to him.
Tea?
"Coffee, anyone?"
"- Er... no, thanks."
"- Er, no, I'm fine."
Tony?
"No, thank you."
"You OK, Tony?"
"You seem a little under... well, under the bed."
I'm fine.
"Tony, come out."
I'd prefer not to.
Listen.
I think we need to talk about this.
I really don't know what you mean.
"Well, me and Sid are together now."
Yeah.
I know.
And you're obviously not OK with it.
Who says I'm not?
"Well, er, you did, pretty much."
Last night.
"Oh, come on."
I was only taking the piss.
You know...
cos it's funny?
"Listen, do you mind?"
I've got an interview.
Got to get ready.
All right.
It's two full-time jobs.
Now I got Bo.
She's a handful on her own.
Bo.
"Oh, man."
Bo.
"Oh, man."
You hit that?
"- Yes, you did."
- I need a drink.
"Fine, but you're my wingman."
I'm tired of being with the ugly chick.
"Oh, my God."
That is good.
That is good.
- It makes my throat tingle.
- I don't think I have a throat left.
"That is some good shit, Mr. T."
"Oh, you."
You are the Kenziest Kenzi ever.
And Dyson...?
- Dyson is a scratchy-faced...
- Yes.
-...
"Grouchy, cooch-tease."
- Yes.
And I should've bit it off when I had the chance.
"Oh, unneeded visual, baby."
"But yes, let it all out."
Let it out.
What else?
What else?
"Ah, monsieur, let us toast our success in the desert."
To the Ark.
When we are very far from here.
That will do.
"Hey, you now..."
Come here!
Come here!
Indy!
Stay with the Ark!
Stay with the Ark!
Look out!
"Oh, my God."
Marion.

Pull on the latch!
Move up!
It's gonna blow up!

Turn it!

Turn it there!
Never mind!
Get back!
Get back!
Get the Ark away from this place immediately.
Have it put on the truck.
I'll get you for this!
Help!
"Ah Foon, that's the man."
Mousy!
Show us some tricks!
I can't.
I'm scared of him.
If I'm half as good as him...
It hurts?
I want a smile from you.
Smile again?
It hurts like hell!
Give me a sweet smile!
Mousy!
I want you to smile at Mousy in future.
Mousy!
Have you forgotten something?
- Let's go!
- Yes.
"Ah Foon, you're great!"
You've got to act tough.
I can never be tough.
I really envy you.
Will Master Huang accept me as a student?
I'll ask him.
I better be going now.
What are you doing?
"Excuse me, my friend."
Stop it!
Go away!
Excuse me...
Excuse me...
How old is she?
"About five, I think."
You like dogs?
"Oh, I got this old dog at home."
I had him 13 years.

Give me the ball.
Out.
"Hey, come on here."
"Hey, let's have that ball."
"Out, out."
Out.

"Oh, she sure has sharp teeth."
She likes you.

Was there something else?
"I'm sorry, I've forgotten your name."
"Uh, Detective Burris."
Otis Burris.
"Uh, no, ma'am, nothing else."
"Hey, yes, you are a good old dog there."
I really appreciate a dog with spirit.
I sure do.
And one that likes people too.
[Music playing]

You want to manipulate me.
You're playing stupid games.
I love you.

"Is that all you can do - torture people, kill people?"
Padre!

"This way, he won't notice when he dies."

Glad to hear it.
No one else around?
No.

Just a minute.
Cilly's been asking about you.
"She's a classy lady now, with a gentleman on the west side."
Good for her.
Good-bye.
Can you figure him out?
"Who's speaking, please?"
"No, I can't hear you."
Oh!
Henschke!
What?
No!
Franz?
He came in here!
How's he look?
Sturdy as an ox.
He wants to come back.
All right.
Thanks.
He's looking for Reinhold.
Yang E-sam. (Two-three)
Is that your real name?
"Yes, sir."
Let's go.
Get in.
Anybody home?
What is it?
Goddamn perv.
Look at this.
What does it say?
"Uncle, this is illegal."
I know.
Then why...
We should stop.
"If you won't help, wait outside."
But Uncle!
"Okay, you wait outside."
What are you staring at?
Go keep a lookout.
What the fuck?
- Son of a bitch!
- Get over here!
Get him off me!
What were you doing poking around the doghouse?
Block the door!
Get over here!
Shit!
"Seong-bok, you bastard!"
Fucking bastard!
Where is it?
Where did it go?
Over there.
Just go.
Where'd he go?

Freeze.
Right there.
Don't move!
That's there.
Let's go.

Absolutely.
"Textbook bust, sir."
"Yes, sir."
Looks like we got a full pound of the blue stuff.
And Heisenberg's real name?
James Kilkelly.
Thank you very much.
It was my pleasure.
Hey.
"You weren't home, so"
I let the delivery guys in.
I hope that's okay.
Absolutely.

A king?
Pillow top?

Thanks!
Get on!
Get on!
Hurry!
"Just get on, hurry!"

This matters to you?
You're so petty.
Let's go.
"Hey, where are you going?"
Home to Shiogama.
"Hey, should I wait for you?"
I'll be waiting.
"""Don't turn the light on"""
"""Because the moonlight"""

Some kid at the park.
You got him back?
Good.
[Inhales]
You want to go rent An Inconvenient Truth ?
So what'd you tell Frank ?
I told him right now I need to be spending some time with my daughter.
"Well, let's put it all on the table."

It's all right.
"Uh, okay, I'm going to count to three and you're going to get out of here, okay ?"
"No, no, no, you're going to hurt yourself."
Don't have a choice.
"All right, one, two, three."
"Okay, okay."
Go.
"Go, go, go, go."
Ryan ?
Ryan ?

We're swingers.
We're not into foursomes.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
She laughs when she's scared.
Get the fuck out.
"Listen, we're not, we're robbers."
"We are robbers, okay, and she's not fucking us."
No.
"All right, she's fucking this guy!"
"Oh God, oh shit, okay."
"Hello, my name is Juan."
I was...
Cleaning the pool.
"Honey, I can explain, okay?"
"This is, this is Juan."
He's...
No!
"Ah, yes, sweet little Angel."
I believe I have something that you want.
You got my attention.
The statue.
Yeah.
Bring the girl to me and you'll get it back.
Sounds like a fair trade to me.
Where you wanna meet?
I need to know the girl is still alive.
Her brother isn't.
"Listen, I'm a businessman."
The death of the little girl is trouble I just don't need.
I need proof of life.
"All right, just a minute."
Hey.
Kid.
Say hi to somebody.
M ike?

To cook Chinese food.
I didn't come back even when Grandpa died.
I trained hard.
Was it all in vain?
What's so great about ShaoIin Kung Fu?
What can you do?
I don't...
You can break logs?
You're strong.
It's just more violence.
Found it.
Good.

But the Teacher said I shouldn't.
Can't deal with the old man.
You're useless.

Don't fight it.

"I better put him over here to dry, though."
He's still wet.
There.
He can dry there.
"Hey, where did this come from?"
I found it.
Where?
The closet.
Huh.
Have you been playing with it?
Yep.
You know how?
I'll show you.
Wait a minute.
You need 2.

I saw it!
I came to check it out.
Not again!
What're you doing?
Let's go!
It's a ball...
That's obvious.
What do we do?
"Yusuki, you touch it."
It's fine.
Just touch it.
Don't.
We don't know what it is.
You're all useless.
Stop!
Don't!
Leave it!
What is it?
Tetra meets Yusuki.
Tetra?
Tetra waited for you.
"Toshi, can I take it home?"
Why you?
"Please, please"
Yusuki is our robot freak.
It's gotta be him.
- Shall we let him?
- Can I?
Really?
"Robin, can I go in now?"
- Who're you?
- Yoyo!
That's right.
You are Yoyo!
Then what was that...
Watch me catch the burglar!
What a fool!
Sure got a lot of mirrors here!
I look good in this outfit.
How come I've got...?
Thief!
"Remember, you're a burglar too!"
That's true!
Let's split to make a search!
- Better get my gear first.
- Hurry!
Catch it!
That's it!
Go tiptoe!
Gotcha!
Don't try and get away!
You're on top of me!
Not my face!
That's how I make my living.
My foot. lt's broken!
Get off!
Gotcha at last!
"Bring a rope, hurry up."
How can I?
You're on top of me.
Don't run!
You'll love it!
- Tractor-tippin's fun.
- This is ridiculous.
"All right, listen."
"When I say go, we go."
But don't let Frank catch you.
Go!
Whoa!
Wait!
Who's Frank?
Mater!
"Wait, Mater!"
"OK, here's what you do."
"You just sneak up in front of 'em, and then honk."
And they do the rest.
Watch this.
Oh!
Oh...
Oh!
Oh...
"I swear, tractors is so dumb!"
"I tell you what, buddy, it don't get much better than this."
"Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy."
Oh!
Oh!
Oh...
"I don't care who you are, that's funny right there."
"Oh, your turn, bud."
"Mater, I can't."
I don't even have a horn.
- Baby.
- I'm not a baby.
What do you think?
I don't know.
What do you think?
"Oh, I think it sounds like fun."
"I know, but here's the thing."
Tomorrow is Wednesday.
Oh.
We've already made plans.
What plans?
Me making dinner while you vacuum the rug?
Exactly.
And here's the other thing.
"If I let you take a night off,"
I have to let everybody take a night off.
Who's everybody?
What are you talking about?
It's just me!
"Mr. Monk, come on, it's one night!"
"Well, then, I guess I'll just have to say no kay."
No-kay.
No-kay.
Which is it?
No or okay?
No-kay.
No-kay.
He's trying to say okay.
That's as close as he's ever going to get.
No-kay.
No-kay.
I'm so excited.
No-kay.
She looks nervous.
Come on.
Come on.
There's no one up here.
Take your shirt off.
Come on.
"Come on, take it off."
What are you scared of?
You scared of me?

Leonard.

Wanna have some fun?
Wanna be safe out there?

I don't like this.
Get away!
Wake up.
You're having a bad dream.
You're having a bad dream.
Wake up.

Father?
You're convinced that it's genuine?
I don't know.
-Can I talk to you for a minute?
-And you will learn....
-Excuse me.
I can't talk about it now.
"What do you mean, you can't talk about it now?"
"Four days already, you can't talk about it."
"Yeah, and you don't understand."
"I can't do it anymore, Frank."
You understand?
Why can't you do it anymore?
What does that mean?
You can't do it anymore?
-It's over.

I'm not.
Go on.

"They don't put innocent people in jail. """
"Well, he was obviously wrong because they do."

They're here!
That's them!

I have to make sure you know that.
"Rose, it wasn't YOU."

"It wasn't you, Rose."
You're a very... a very sexy girl.
"And... and I know that it's unfair of me to say, now you're with Alex, but..."
"Who said I... who said that I am, I was with Alex?"
Your mother.

I can't get to sleep.
"Oh, honey."
Goddamn it.

There's nothing.
"Oh, Karl."
"Jesus Christ, Karl, don't do that."
"Very sorry, but you see, no rats."
No rats.
Thanks a lot.
That's terrific.
"Oh, my God."
Okay.
Unroll your fist.
Arm up.
Very good.
"That wasn't so bad, was it?"
Remain perfectly still.
Breathe normally.
Tell me if you feel a vibration.
Regan?
You feel anything?
Can you feel this?
Are... are you okay?
Are you okay?
Dad!
"Hey, baby."
It's me.
I...
There's something strange going on in here.
There's a zoo in your fridge.
You okay?
"No, I think I ate something bad."
So I'm gonna...
I'm gonna get out of here.
This is to be continued.
Bye.

He's going.
"He can still hear you, if you have anything you'd like to say to him."
Dad.
I love you.
But what about Jackson?
I don't want to leave him.
He'll be fine.
"Come on, Arthur."
It's time.
Wow.
- Who is this?
- It's Owen.
Arthur just passed.
Knew you'd want to know.
It was very peaceful.
His son was with him.

Is that with the spin?
You do that...
"Wait, let me try."

- Let me see it again.
I was...
We were both double-taking at the same time.

That was pretty good.
That was good.

What do you get if you cut a bra in half?
- (CHUCKLES) What?
- A yarmulke with a chin strap.
- MAN:
"Can you guys keep it down, please?"
- What?
Can you please keep it down?
I think it'd be a neat idea.
"- Stand up, Josh."
- OK.
- I'm gonna show you how to take a punch.
- I know how to take a punch.
I'm gonna show you the right way to take a punch.
"OK, hit me."
- Where?
- Right in my stomach.
"Hit me as hard as you can, just at my stomach."
That wasn't as hard as I can.
I know.
I hope not.
Hit me again.
Harder.
Seriously.
"- Yeah, OK."
- Go.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
- Harder?
- Go.
Harder.
I'm fine.
"What I did was essentially, breathing is key."
"- Think of it as, like..."
- Just hit me.
"- All right, you ready?"
OK.
- Yeah.
One...
Two...
I might change the title.
You should totally record it.
"No, it's not there yet."
Still needs some tweaks.
Not from what I've just heard.
Let's do it.
Olivia does all the recording.
I don't know how to work the equipment.
It's easy.
"All you do is press ""Record,"""

"No, no!"
"Mom, this is for Casey's own good!"
Casey?
"Take my hand, Casey, I'm right here."
"Well, I think I'll be off."
Why?
"I don't confuse you, do I, lvy?"
"I believe I do confuse you, don't I?"
I ain't confused by nobody.
Let go.
Do you hear?
Let go.
"Let go, you hear?"
"- What's he doing, lvy?"
"- Oh, you let go too!"
"Watch out, lvy love."
"- Here, here."
What's this all about?
- It's him.
He insulted her.
"- He's lying, I tell you!"
- He tried to break her arm.
"- He did, did he?"
"- Yes, yes."
Tried to break her arm.
You will?
You want another one?
No!
No!
Stop it!
Stop it!
"I'll stop it, sir."
"Hey, boys!"
"Now, boys!"
"Boys, will you...?"
I can't understand what happened.
Changed my name.
I never told her where I went.
I never saw her again.
I...
I reinvented myself.
But it didn't matter.
"No matter what I did,"
I chose
Angela.
Angela.
Like a name would protect me.
"That I dreamed I could have a life, a chance."
Didn't matter.
It wasn't done with me.
"It's coming for me, Father, I know it."
_
My name is Regan MacNeil.
I'm Chris MacNeil.
I've come to see my daughter.
I don't want to go.
Go home.
You know the way.
I don't want to go.
You'll be fine.
"Trust me, just go."
"You're too young to come, Jesse."
You won't even like it.
*Jesse:
Mark!
*
Just go!
Hey!
- Hey!
Hey!
"- Jimmy, over here!"
- Hey!
"- Hey, Tillie."
- Dammit!
- Did he see us?
Is he coming back?
- Forget it.
- What's up?
- Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!
- I didn't expect this to happen.
"- Yeah, sure!"
We've only got 50 yards to the bottom.
"Now, let's move."
- Come on!
- I can't move.
- What?
- I can't move.
"All right, let me look."
It's probably broken.
Great!
"- Here, take one of these."
- What is it?
- A pain pill.
- I don't want it.
- Shut up and take it.
- I don't want it!
Now I'll have to think of something else.
We're going to lower you down.
Cheol-yeong couldn't come.
His sow is farrowing.
What's with your face?
This ain't a joke?
"You're serious, right?"
Yeah.
"Cross your heart, or your mom's a whore?"
You prick!
This is no time for jokes.
What a fucking loser.
Go!
- Nothing?
- No.
Don't just stand around.
Check the back.
What's that?
Fucking bastard...
Byeong-gyu!
Over here.
Hurry UP-
Is that him?
Over there.
Where?
Follow me.
Where?
What the...?
Who's that?
What is that thing?
Don't come any closer.
Back off.
Back off.
Stop it.
The same voice that I heard two nights ago.
He said...
"""Do not be afraid."
"My name... is Indrid Cold""."
And he said to me...
"""In a place this size."
Equator.
Three hundred.
Three hundred will die.
Wait for me.
I will return.
"I will see you in time""."
And that was it.
It's a Iittle...
Have a look.
She knew.
I didn't see anything.
You want to hear the chief's latest phone call?
Yes?
- Thank God you're there.
- Gordon?
"I know I sounded crazy the other day, but things are getting weird out here."
"Slow down, Gordon."
- He's here.
- Who's here?
Indrid Cold.
He's standing right next to me.
Get over to Gordon's right away.
He says Indrid Cold is there.
"Gordon, let me talk to him."
Sure.
Hang on.
I saved my job.
That's good.
But how?
"Well, last night I showed my work."
I will be promoted soon.
Congratulations.
So today's dinner is your treat.
Okay?
Done.
Tell Carol as well.
Cool.
How did you come here?
"Wow, Carol!"
It's amazing!
I also feel like doing something.
Shall I go for a shoulder massage?
Very funny.
Go out.
We will meet for dinner.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
We will meet for dinner.
But what about lunch?
I am very busy right now.
I can't.
Please go.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Give me some money then.
What?
Is good.
It make you relax.
(GROANS)
Get me out of here!
Get me out!
"Oh, pardon moi!"
"Oh, pardonnez-moi, monsieur."
Let me out.
"Wait, I shall get the button."
WILBUR:
Easy!
One moment.
Stop this thing.
"Voila, we stop."
"Good, oui?"
And now to get you down.
Just one moment.
"One moment, monsieur."
"Monsieur, one moment."
(SIGHS)
And now for the landing.
(GASPING)
"Hey, hey, hey, hey!"
Let me go!
Let me go!
"There we are, monsieur."
You are next.
Shampoo?
You're a sick man.
That's it!
"I've got the merchandise all right, but I can't deliver it."
They're checking everyone in and out of the hotel.
Thank you.
"Alright, say ""kimchi""."
Kimchi.
Here.
Thanks.
No!
Get away from me!
I said don't!
Don't!
Let me go!
Please!
Please!
Don't do this!
"No, no..."
Where's the vibrator?
"Sorry, I'll go get it."
Found it.
Ready.
And... action!
"Wait, no..."
Stop...
"Please, let me go."
No streetwalkers allowed here.
You talk big for a kid.
Thanks.
See you in a bit.
But you allow that?
Delivery girls are fine.
They're not filthy like you.
"I used to be a call girl, you know."
That's an ancient term.
You're showing your age.
What are you going to do with him?
"What do you mean, ""do with him""?"
He can't stay here forever.
No.
"When he's recovered, that's for him to decide."
"You look a little flushed, dear."
Do I?
Perhaps you should get some fresh air.
"Well, when it's a little cooler, I will."
"Well, it's time for my rest, I think."
I'll look in on the patient.
Hello.
Hello.
I've had an idea.
"Now, look."
"I say the word, and you repeat it after me."
You understand?
Never mind.
You'll soon catch on.
"""Chair."" Now you say it."
"""Chair."""
Chair.
Very good!
Very good!
"""Door."""
Door.
Oh!
"Uh, ""clock."""
- Clock.
- Yes.
"""Mirror."""
- Mirror.
It smells good.
I'll just go get the clothes.
That machine's thunking again.
Paulie!
"How are you, Frank?"
"-l'm good, considering."
"-Yeah, of course."
Of course.
Coffee?
Nettie's down with the laundry.
Stay for lunch?
Osso buco.
Osso buco.
Nettie fixes it piemontese.
Peppers and everything.
"No, that's all right. I had my lunch."
-Can I get coffee?
"-No, thanks."
So.
What do you think?
"Well, same old thing."
This time it's this Calhoun guy.
I never liked him.
-He's a cracker.
-Of the worst kind.
He's out of here tomorrow.
"No, I don't think so."
What are you talking about?
He's a reed.
You push him and he bends.
Not this one.
This one's a terrier.
In our hearts you are today...
You're thirty three.
The age of Christ.
- Cheers.
Here's to you.
Bottoms up!
I bet you had forgotten.
Call us when you wake up.
Cheers.
Yes.
Psychomot.
It's you.
You are Mister...
Thomas.
Right?
- Yes.
How are you?
I just woke up.
I didn't call you.
Excuse me?
- I didn't call you.
How are we in contact?
It's normal.
Do you see the small cube next to you?
It's a narco-stopper.
It calls us when you wake up.
Dr Sorensen wanted to talk to you.
I'll go get him.
Doctor Sorensen!
Mr Thomas.
Hello.
I imagine you don't recognize me.
There it is!
"It'll soon be a steak, poor ostrich."
Let's scare it off.
-With what?
With these.
Here it comes...
We'll make you run for your feathers.
Senna.
The firefighters said that a cigar started the fire.
I don't buy it.
It was an accident.
Let me make you feel better.
Think.
-No.
"Please, think."
All grown-ups suck.
-Right.
Let me at least hold you.
"I'm hurting, Jemina."
Jemina speaking.
-What are you doing there?
Taking care of this fool.
-Good.
I want to talk to him.
-He's sleeping.
Taisto is in the hospital.
He's about to die.
It's high time to come see him.
I'll come right away.
"-Not you, honey."
"Calm down, Mom."
I've got an idea.
- Yes...
Straight ahead.
Good night!
"Come on, we can't stay herei."
- He says that...
- What does he say?
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
"Jimmy, you can't come here."
Never.
My father...
the war... he's sick.
I brought this for him.
- I see.
- Yes.
"- Pretty, isn't it?"
- Yes.
"But put it away, I can't take it."
My father musn't know.
I have to go.
I need to drop it off.
Wait.
"No, wait, listen..."
"I wanted to say, Jimmy, that I'm very happy when I'm with you."
- But I have to go.
- Wait.
What a lovely butt.
So firm.
It's marvellous.
"It's lovely, very love."
Come!
"Come, yes, like that."
- Oh!
- [Laughing]
- Albert!
- [Claire] Forget it!
Forget it!
- Why?
I need a bigger man.
- Bigger?
- Yeah.
- What do you -
- He's -
- Bigger in what way?
- He's too short for me.
- I need a tall man.
- He's too -
He's too...
He's too short?
When do we take off all our clothes?
"Ah, Helen."
Helen!
[Claire] I don't care what you say.
"Lfhe's good-looking, I don't give him to anybody."
So you mean we don't have a chance around you.
Is that what we're saying?
"- Oh, no."
I don't say that at all.
- Oh.
I take him fast and whisk him away.
- l...
I don't give any other woman a chance.
- I've noticed that.
"You know what, Helen?"
I know.
"- Well, we got 'em."
- Yeap.
- Yours look awesome on you.
"- Yea, so did yours."
"Hey, I know we never really talked about stuff... since that day."
Are we cool?
Yea.
Course.
Precious.
"Hey, you hungry or anything?"
Not really.
I'm just gonna take a walk.
"Yea, screw food."
I could use a nap if you wanna know the truth.
You want me take your bag home?
No?
This better not be Russ.
It's my Dad.
Really?
"I've tried to get the pizza place, but I..."
I pressed his number instead.
Long story.
"Hang on a sec, Phil."
See you Daze!
Hey Dad.
April?
"Are you... uhm, April?"
Hi.
Hi.
I was a friend of your father's.
I just want to let you know that...
Or for whoever's controlling him?
We have to talk to him.
We have to tell him.
He's not gonna l...
Erica!
Unh!
Over here.
"Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey!"
I think she's having a seizure.
He's alive.
"Hey, we need to get her to a hospital."
Derek... only to Derek.
When we get her to the hospital... to Derek.
To Derek.
Go.
"Hey, Scott!"
I'm staying here with you.
He can't take her alone.
Not like this.
And Matt...
"I've got to call an ambulance for him, just go."
This doesn't feel right.
It's okay.
"No, it's not."
"No, it's not right."
It doesn't... it doesn't mean anything.
But it feels like it does.
"Scott, go."
Go.
Okay.
Hello?
Over here.
Here we go.
Hey.
"Yeah, baby."
[Laughing]
We are the champions
My friends
And we'll keep on fighting
Till the end
Damn the torpedoes!
Full speed ahead!

We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
"- So far, so good."
Let's go.

[Loud Crashing]
I'm not gonna look.
- I think that's a good idea.
- Yup.
[ Chattering ]
"- Easy, easy."
- I got it.
Let's get him up.
"- Dick, where's the ticket?"
- [ Moans ]
- Answer me.
- He can't.
He's been sedated.
Why did you do that?
"Or, cut off his head, or..."
Crush the skull.
Okay.
Ah...
"Blair, I'm like 99 percent sure he's dead."
Just get it over with.
Just...
Whack his head as hard as you can.
Get a good grip.
Shit.
"Blair, you scared the shit out of me."
Ollie!
Oh fuck.
Crush the skull!
"See, it's okay."
Everything's gonna be just fine.
What's your name?
Macy.
No it's not.
It's Vivian.
Your name is Vivian Dorp.
"Will you get us a drink, pet?"
"Circulate, all right."
Enjoy yourselves.
"All right, Craig, get me a drink."
"Oh, easy!"
Excuse me.
"~ Right, I'm just going to say a few words."
~ Really?
"All right, everyone."
Gather round.
Here.
Why do you still go home?
What have you been doing?
Sleeping.
Reading.
Waiting.
What for?
You taste of sleep.
You taste of car.
New car?
- Want to take a look?
- Later.
- Wait... the car.
- Later.
Are you driving?
Are you kidding?
I'm drunk.
"Well, then you've got a long way to go."
What's wrong?
"I want to come, too."
Don't start that again.
I'm frightened.
Why?
In case she doesn't come back.
Listen.
Lizzy will get well again.
That's why I'm taking her to the vet.
Anyone there?
Come on.
Just one more hour.
I can tell you're still tired.
Luis to Dad.
How did he do today?
I hear you can handle yourself.
I guess.
Good night.
"Uh, excuse me."
Why me?
I like to think I see things in people.
Slow down.
The car is not going anywhere.
Mom.
"Hey, sweetheart."
Hi.
Hey.
Whoo.
Ah.
There you go.
Did you see what's in the driveway?
"Uh, yeah, I saw."
Hey.
"So that's yours, huh?"
Yeah.
Dad got it for me.
That was very nice of him.
Yeah.
I-
"- I know it looks like... well, awesome, but it's super safe."
Dad-
- Dad made sure.
"And I promise to always go the speed limit or below, way below."
And it gets great gas mileage.
So Dad said I can take it around the block a few times.
That okay?
Look at you!
And the other students?
Haven't seen them since the dojo closed.
Watch it!
We've grown up.
It must be hard for you.
Look what happened to Iwai.
Stay in touch.
Where do you want this?
Over there.

Ni Hao.
Fried rice please.
It's a busy day!
Better than playing soccer.
You're right.
Teacher!

What teacher?
Teacher!
I know you're here.
You can't go in there.
Fried rice!
The soup's coming!
It's Rin!
Welcome back!
Teacher!
"Teacher, the dojo?"
Did you go?
It's in ruins.
What happened?
You must be starving!
"- No, thanks, Da."
- Come on.
All right.
Good girl.
"How about you, Kay?"
"Ah, no."
I'll slip on up to bed.
I'd come up with ya... only I've an awful throat on me.
Cheerio now...
Grannie.
"Ohh, Molly"
My Irish Molly
My sweet acushla dear
I'm fairly off my trolley
"My Irish Molly, when you are near"
Still think you should tell us who the da is.
"You can think away, then."
Your mummy took it very well.
Yeah.
She was great.
"She's a bit old-fashioned, you know."
Set in her ways.
Yeah.
"No, she was great."
So were you.
Ahh.
Those your pals over there?
Yeah.
Go on over to them.
I'll be all right on me own.
"Ah, no."
Go on.
That's not enough.
But it's the same thing...
For me.
It's quite something.
You have to go outside.
- I couldn't.
Yes.
You can.
- No.
I'm sure you can.
OK.
Where is your apartment?
Defosset Street.
Near the Luxembourg Center.
Are you coming?
You remember the park.

On the right from Defosset Street.
I'll be waiting on a bench.
No.
I couldn't.
- I'm leaving.
Eva.
I couldn't.
- Do you love me?
And you?
If you can't go out for me.
I won't even ask myself.
You said there was a bond between us.
We'll see.
I'm leaving.
"Hello, welcome to my home."
That's all right.
- Did I hurt you?
"- No, you didn't spill a drop."
- I guess...
- That's funny?
I guess it's funny.
Do you think we could turn the TV off?
That's better.
- We have to relax.
- I agree.
- How are classes?
- Going well.
- And your book?
- The outline is actually...
It's coming along.
It's almost there.
It's not at all what I expected.
It's harder than I thought.
But I'll...
I'm sure that I'll get there.
I want you to get there.
What did you say?
- Rose.
- Talk to me.
"Oh, yes."
"Oh, no."
"Oh, God."
"Oh, Rose."

I don't want to do this!
"I'm sorry, Rose."

All right.
Here we go.

I couldn't find a phone.
I couldn't find a phone anywhere.
I couldn't find a phone.
Come here.
Come on.
"All right, listen."
"You go in there, and you find a phone."
"You call 911, and you stay here till help gets here."
You understand?
Go!
Let's go!
You all right?
"Hey, hey!"
"Hey, buddy!"
- I sang it four times.
- I knew you could do it.
"Hey, stay awake!"
You gotta stay awake for me.
"Come on, you gotta stay awake!"
"All right, this will do the trick."
We'll use this jack to get your leg out.
So are you a Cubs fan?
Yeah?
"Um, not enough... natural light."
Thank you.
This is it.
What's up?

- Yeah.
"Okay, whatever happens..."
- Good luck.
"- Yeah, man, you too."
"All right, mother-frickin' Avon calling."
"Let's meet Julia and her husband, John."
"John, you love your wife a lot, right?"
Just a minute.
All right.
Yeah?
That'll be $16.75.
- Here you go.
- Great.
Who the hell are you?
Who the hell are you?
Do you know this woman?
Are you kidding me?
She's my wife.
No way.
Is she dead?
- What?
- No.
"- No, wait."
"- Hold on, hold on."
"We want to ask you some questions, please."
Open this door...
- For my mom.
"- Yeah, whatever."
No.
It's over here.
In the store on the corner.
"It's swag, so I got it down on the corner."
"Go ahead, sweetheart, I'll see you."
"- Thanks, Jimmy."

There is a bomb!
Which bomb?

Which battery?

Where do you think you're going?
Where are we going?
No Te preocupes.

Nice.
"Wager, sir?"
Maybe later.
Hot night.
"Oh, they're all hot nights."
I wasn't talking about the temperature.
"Okay, wait, guys."
I'm sorry.
Do you call these 11s or Jacks?
I just get so confused.
"Oh, I win?"
Wow.
How about that?
"Honestly, you guys, this is my first time."
- Your drink?
- Oh.
Thank you very much.
"I mean, I think it's just beginner's luck."
I don't know.
This is so fun.
"All right, that's the end of my shift."
"Ladies and gentlemen, have a great night."
Wait.
I almost forgot.
McCallum's office called.
They bumped the meeting till tomorrow night.
"Eddie, look, I... she's not Mary."
Not by a mile.
But you know what?
No one everwill be.
"Hey, Ed."
I'm sorry about today.
I'm sure Gwen is very nice.
Maybe some other time.
It's about 1:00 in the morning.
"I'm a little wired, so I'm driving down to Richmond tonight."
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Bye.
Hi.
I'm sorry.

"Well, hey, Gordon."
She said she doesn't wanna talk.

Work?
I don't care about work.
"Oh, you see this?"
"This is work, ok?"
Dad...
"Ok, what else?"
My cell phone?
Work.
Definitely work.
Garbage.
"And uh, what, watch?"
You take that.
"No more work, ok?"
"Dad, what's gotten into you?"
You're embarrassing yourself.
I want you to come and have some lunch with me.
Just lunch--
"One hour, that's all."
Please.
"Ok, I'll meet you back at the van, Martin."
Ok?
Don't let him do this.
He's just messing with you again.
I'll be fine.
I promise.
Ok?
Just go.
We leave at 5:00.
Don't be late.
"Hey, you ready?"
"It's not a ghost, okay."
You have to run.
"Why would I think it's a ghost, Blair?"
Come on!
Whoa!

We have to warn 'em.
Can you get the door open?
"Blair, I have an idea."
Okay?
"We have to stay away from the wall, all right?"
"Okay, here we go."
Ready?
Oh shit.
"Come on, come on, come on."
It's not working.
I have an idea.
"Okay, hurry."
He's talking to the sheriff.
"I sure do appreciate you letting me take a look around, Mr. Tucker."
Please.
Call me Jack.
I'd rather not.
Okay.
The girls are here now.
Bring them in.
There's plenty of room.
No one's coming in here.
"Don't you want to take a look at the girls, Franz?"
No!
I'm starting to cry.

Things die.
It's part of life.
It's bad to kill.
But it's not bad to die.
You die?
"Well, yes, someday."
I die?
I don't know.
You're made of metal but you have feelings.
And you think about things.
And that means you have a soul.

I'm in a hurry.
Get in.

As long as you want.
The kids wake you up?
No.
I just couldn't sleep.
You want to talk?
No.
"It's all right, Joe."
You don't have to stay up.
You'll get through this.
Everyone's so mad at me.

Doesn't a gentleman bring enough for everybody?
This is the greatest moment of my life.
"Okay, that's it."
Time's up.
Any questions?
"After sex, you smoke."
It's a rule.
Anybody have any matches?

"I mean, I don't want to."
Oh...
Stop!

Yes!
Let's see.
"'If she is not talented, sack her.'"
'Throw her out.'
'I have thrown her sketches in the dustbin.'
What happened?
You have still not got ready.
What is this?
Who wrote this?
Mom.
- Your mom is great.
"Gul, since the time you have returned from office.."
..you seem very upset.
Today was my last day in office.
What happened?
- What?
It's a long story.
Come on.
Let's just go out for dinner.
"Are you sure, Gul?"
- Yeah.
I am sure.
Come on.
Let's just go.
- Both of you go.
I am tired.
I want to sleep.
You are sure?
- Okay.
Let's just go.
Alright.
Yes.
I will show you.
Whether I can trust him.
Take your time.
You've only just met.
"OK, Mother."
I'd like to know if it is love between Marco and me.
What do you think?
How should I know?
Hi.
What are you doing?
Watching TV.
Eating.
Could you?
Sorry.
I'll put it back.
Perhaps I should go to the movies after all.
"Oh, come off it."
Stop cleaning up his mess.
What do you mean?
- Any news about your car?
- Small-town cops.
Forget it.
Leave it.
I'll do it.
"Take this, will you?"
- Wow!
- Reflexes...
Shit!
We could spend some more time together.
We could be closer.
I mean...
I could live here.
You and I could do the ski courses together.
Yeah.
Welcome to my world.
"OK, let's go, Team Rambo."
"Hit it, girls."
"# Rambo, Rambo, he's our man"
"# If he can't do it, no one can!"
What?
Why don't I have girls?
"I invented the game, I get the cheerleaders."
That's the rules.
"Prof, I meant to say, I gave them all jobs in marketing."
Hope that's cool.
Uh-huh.
"You three are fired, in that case."
We can't afford you any more.
Er...has it started yet?
"Not yet, G-Man, you're just in time."
"Yo, Rambo."
Looks like I got a cheerleader of my own.
Please don't employ him.
"Give us a chant, G-Man."
"# Come on, Stylax, you can do it"
# Stick that ball in the bastard jug
Not bad.
# Rambo!
Paulus!
Rambo!
Agh!
OK. 53-all.
Next point wins.
Urbo!
"Yes, Paulus!"
Kevin Calhoun.
I've just been talking to a friend of yours.
- I've got the probation report.
- Where are you?
Right around the corner.
Meet me at Franklin and Hudson.
Schwartz?
- George.
- Abe called me.
He's in the back.
That's the only way in.
The back door's gated.
All right.
I got a couple marriages.
Abe.
It's your play!
Throw the card for me.
You've been practicing all your life.
"Freddie, give us a minute."
He's dead!
Schwartz is dead.
I heard it on the phone.
I was...
Get ahold of yourself.
It's okay.
You were right.
You knew it from the minute we saw him that day.
It wasn't kosher.
There was a second report.
That was only a feeling.
Now it's a fact.
5 people are dead.
"Oh, I don't know, Ellis."
Maybe you just shouldn't have made me so bloody small.
"Your ticket, madam."
Safe journey.
"Next, please."

- So you're back?
"- Yes, I am."
- And you'll stay?
- Yes.
- You can't stay here.
I know.
"But what have they done to you, Allan?"
"They didn't do anything, Mum."
It was an accident.
Something's happened.
All the old shit has to change.
I've made a decision.
My life's going to be proper now.
I'll lead a proper life.
With a job.
An apartment.
Maybe a girlfriend.
There are four walls.
You can even look out the window.
I'll take it.
I have to see whether my car will start.
It's a Ford Mustang '73.
Can I get you a beer?

- An FF?
I'm Allan.

She's still not answering.
"Yeah, Morgan."
We're on our way to Hilary Ross' house now.
She's still not answering her phone.
"All right, call local police."
He's not going to go quietly.
Do you have Mayor Wennington?
Yeah.
Keep me posted.
You got it.
Hello.
You've reached Hilary Ross.
I'm still getting nothing.
That's her car.
"All right, you two go around back."
I'll draw his fire while you flank him.
You sure you want to split up?
We gotta cover the back and the front in case he runs.
Let's go.
Aah!
Aah!
FBI!
Ohh!

"Go, go!"
He's upstairs.
Aah!
Get in here!

"Hey, I thought I told you guys to stay put."
Her fault.
We need to check for other victims.

"John, you're with me."
Don't you die.
Don't you die on me.
Come on.
You're gonna live and see what you did.

Come on.
Don't you die.

"Hey, I got it."

You don't have to say it.
You don't have to say it.
It's okay.
"It's okay, babe."
It's okay.
Okay.
I'm so glad you came.
I'm so glad you...
"Oh, babe."

I'm so pleased you're not dead!
"Indy, Indy, we have no time."
"If you still want the Ark, it is being loaded onto a truck for Cairo."
Truck?
What truck?
Let's go!
Get back to Cairo.
"Get us some transport to England- boat, plane, anything."

It's a zinger.
She's a lotto girl.
Her number came up.
Get it?
Mmm-hmm.
"Do you remember last year,"
"Hey, uh..."
I'm sorry you kids had to see that.

"Yup, yup, so true."

I have nothing left.
But I can bet something else.

You'll have my body if you win the next hand.
Or I'll take all your money.

You're brave.
You like to play.

Two cards.
No cards for you?
You think you're stronger than me.

What do you say to that.

Bastard.
Go ahead.
Take me.
Go ahead.

Um...
"He was here a couple of minutes ago, but I know he's going on soon."
"- I was just wondering, is he okay?"
"- Yeah, he seemed fine."
- Tell him to call me after.
- Okay.
All right.
Y'all having fun?
Good.
Good.
I'm glad.
"Well, our next performer is Eddie Tennenbaum, and, uh..."
- Whoo!
- Yeah.
"Yes, we all love him."
"No, he's not..."
Okay...
"He's not here, though."
I'm sorry.
He's not here.
- But he is...
"- Come on, Eddie."
I don't know where he is.
We can't find him.
Which is fine.
I'm sure he'll be here any second.
"In the meantime, I can tap-dance or something."
"In the meantime, I can tap-dance or something."
Eddie?
"Are we back there, Eddie?"
Anywhere?
"It's okay, it's okay..."
Hyo-jin.
Hyo-jin?
What is this?
You're all right?
"Morning, Dad."
But she never eats fish...
Something's wrong with her.
I heard you and Hyo-jin last night.
I asked the old lady next door to recommend a good shaman.
"I'm gonna consult with him, just so you know."
Got that?
Okay.
Good.
Hey.
Say hello.
This is my nephew.
"What, a priest?"
"Not yet, he's in training."
A deacon.
We'll need a translator to talk to the man.
You speak Japanese?
Just a little.
He lived in Japan when he was young.
What's that on your neck?
Nothing.
You've gotta be kidding me.
"What's your name, son?"
Yang E-sam.
Two-three
Is that your real name?
"Yes, sir."
Yeah.
Sure.
I'm down.
Totally cool.
We can just bypass the whole little coffee thing.
Yeah right.
Kind of awkward yeah...
I know.
Wash?
Hola!
Wash?
No I didn't pee on my hands.
Yo mama.
Hey did you see ZACH?
He's over there in the corner booth.
Ah no I didn't see him.
Did you see JP?
Yep.
I saw him.
He looks really hot tonight.
Did you talk to him?
Did you just say he looks hot?
Sorry it was really tacky.
Wasn't it?
So what's the deal with you and ZACH?
Have you guys ever hooked up before?
ZACH?
- Yep.
"Um, no not really."
Seriously?
"Yeah seriously, why are you asking?"
I just can't believe you've never hooked up with him before.
How are you?
Good.
Ow!
Richie!
It was cute when you were five.
Shut up and help me.
Ah!
Freed.
"Hey, ab..."
Sent-minded.
What is he doing here?
You know Brody's my partner.
He comes with the car.
I'll catch you later.
Could he be any more disgusting?
Ha ha.
You don't want to know.
Did you tell Steve you knew?
"Hell, no."
This is your mess.
I'm just a shoulder to cry on.
I appreciate it.
Mom knows.
Is she mad?
"You know, more hurt than mad."
I told you to tell 'em last night.
I couldn't.
The Bears were winning.
Everybody was really happy.
Exactly!
Always take advantage of a good mood.
"Well, you could always quit."
Oh.
Oh.
# Do-do-do-do do-do-do
# Do-do-do-do-do
# Do-do... #
"So, you get a turkey baster and you..."
Is that singing?
I can't hear anything.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
HE GROANS
Where's the fucking remote?
"Oh, no."
"It's all right, you don't have to go."
"I'm sorry, Norma."
I can't do it.
It's my babies here I need.
What are you talking about?
"I'm not coming back, Norm."
"And I am sorry to you three an' all, you went to so much trouble."
"Food was lovely, though."
It's all right.
I understand.
Here.
Cheers.
So what are you going to do now?
Are you gonna go home?
Nah.
She'll come round.
She's just not thinking straight.
Who?
A strange man.
He's trying to get in.
"It's okay, it's okay..."
Hyo-jin.
Hvo-jm?
What is this?
You're all right?
"Morning, Dad."
But she never eats fish...
Something's wrong with her.
I heard you and Hyo-jin last night.
I asked the old lady next door to recommend a good shaman.
"I'm gonna consult with him, just so you know."
Got that?
Okay.
Good.

You speak Japanese?
Just a little.
He lived in Japan when he was young.
What's that on your neck?
Nothing.
You've gotta be kidding me.
"What's your name, son?"
God.
I want this baby.
"But it's not that simple, is it?"
"I mean, it might turn out to be... brownish."
"Oh, right."
And is Moz racist?
No.
"That's not the point, is it?"
It's just... (KNOCK AT DOOR)
I'm comin'!
"'Ey, that's what got you into trouble in the first place."
- Hiya.
Is Moz in?
- He's off hunter-gathering.
He's out gettin' some cigs.
- Can I wait for him?
- Who are you?
Craig.
Friends call me Craigie.
Moz calls me Craigie.
I've got a delivery for him.
Really good gear.
He's been asking us to come round for ages.
- Shall I spark up a doobie?
- I suppose that's the least you could do.
Yeah.
- You haven't got a beer?
"- I have, yeah."
"- You two lesbos, then?"
- What?
- I'm bi.
She's bi-curious.
Call my assistant to set up a meeting.
Know what?
I'm good.
"Besides, I think your next picture's gonna be a prison drama."
"- Hey, still pissed at me?"
- Yep.
"Oh, come on."
I'll make it up to you the next time I'm in town.
You better.
"[Doors close, engine starts]"
That was really cute.
"Oh, stop it."
Kendall.
Ha... nice to see you.
How was San Pedro?
"Wasn't too much traffic, was there?"
What freeway did you take?
"Well played, Castle."
"You beat me, unfair and square."
All right.
Let's get this over with.
Where is she?
Her text said it was important.
I don't know.
"- Let's go, then."
- Yeah.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
What?
I don't know.
"Ah, now, Jesus..."
"- No, I do know."
- Well?
I'm not telling.
"Now, look..."
"Jesus, do you hear that?"
Gobshite!
"Now, don't start that."
Just tell us.
- I can't.
- Why not?
"- I just can't, right?"
"- Well, is he married?"
"No, he's not."
"Well, that's something I suppose."
"Ah, Kay..."
"Jesus, stop it, will you?"
"The music getting to you, is it?"
They're inside watching the telly.
"Go on, get in there."
Go.
Get in.
Go on.
Will he marry you?
"No, I don't think so."
"Ooh, the Iouser."
"That's cheatin', that is."
- It's not a game.
"- I know that, Kay."
"I mean, it's his fault as much as Sharon's... isn't it, whoever he is."
- Piss off
- I´m at the dancefloor.
- We're out of coke.
- I'II never last the night.
I've just seen Danny.
Yugo Danny.
Over there.
- What's up?
"- What's up, Simon?"
Happy Birthday.
- Thanks for the drinks.
- Order whatever you like.
- How can I help you?
- We need some blow.
- That hard-hitter blow?
- I haven't any on me.
- Can you get some?
- Maybe.
But I've no wheels.
- I'II drive.
- When do we get it?
I've got pussy going.
You'll have to take 10 grams minimum.
- We'll take 20.
If we go now.
- That'll be 2500 in cash.
- I haven't got it.
- We haven't got that much.
Then I can't help you.
Here.
- What's the PIN?
- 1632.
There's your answer.
Maybe.
Maybe not.
Come with me.
Let's confirm this.
"Schmidt, how you doing?"
"Uh, not -- not -- n-not good."
I'm -
- I'm woozy.
C-can't -- can't feel my legs.
You look nervous.
Nervous?
No.
"Well, you should be nervous, because if he's lying -- if I learn that he's wasting my time --"
"Hey, guys!"
Come here!
There's something wrong!
What?
What's wrong?
What's wrong with him?
I don't know.
He must be having some kind of allergic reaction to the drug.
I ca-
- I ca-- I can't...breathe.
He's dead.
You killed him.
What if he was lying?
!
He wasn't lying!
He gave you the answer!
Ask your guy!
Rashad!
"Oh, God, it hurts!"
Worst porn ever!
Worst porn ever!
"-Oh, make it stop!"
-I am trying!
Get the ball.
Ready?
Get the ball!
"You're cute, but you're not too smart."
Did I just throw this?
-Hi.
-Hi.
I accidentally packed these with my stuff.
-Who is this?
-Phoebe's friend's dog.
I don't know his real name.
I call him Mozzarella.
You are so cute.
"I wish I could play, but I've gotta go to work."
I hope I stop talking like this before my meeting.
"Yes, I do."
"Bye-bye, Joey."
"Seriously, I can't stop it."
Come here!
Hey!
That's Rachel.
She used to live here.
Might as well be honest with you.
We love her.
But we can't have her.
I really miss her.
"Hey, you understand, right?"
So we'll skip class tomorrow and go hiking?
I was kind of hoping to give my legs a day off.
Come on.
It'll be fun.
I know this off-leash trail.
"- Oh, I don't have a dog."
- I do.
Lola.
My pug.
- You have a pug named Lola?
"- Yeah, short for Lolita."
"- And she's getting pretty fat, dude."
- Let's get those heart rates up!
"- All right, let's go!"
"Come on, now!"
Ten rounds of jumping jacks!
"Yo, up!"
Up!
Up!
Come on!
"- Ah, hello, ladies."
"- Hi, Mrs. Whedon."
"- Hey, Mom."
- Where's Dad?
He's in the kitchen with Nicole's mom.
"OK, those two fingers on those..."
That...
Yeah.
Second fret.
Your pinky goes on the third fret there.
Hit it.
Hit again.
Where the hell did he go?
"Oh, wait."
"Wait, wait, wait."
Got him.
- Looks like it's going down.
- Take him.
Freeze!
"Hey, right there."
Don't move.
"Come on, let's get him up."
Jesus!
I think they bought it.
Absolutely.
"Textbook bust, sir."
"Yes, sir."
Looks like we got a full pound of the blue stuff.
"Oh, and Heisenberg's real name?"
James Kilkelly.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
It was my pleasure.
Hey.
"You weren't home, so I let the delivery guys in."
- I hope that's okay.
- Absolutely.
So you bought a bed.
Yeah.
"What is that, a king?"
Pillow top?
"Oh, my God."
You really are a chemistry teacher.
You mind?
Wait.
This guy's Ollie?
They fucking talk about Ollie all the time.
I thought they made him up.
What?
"It's always like, ""we went to the zoo with Ollie."
"We built a fort with Ollie."""
"""Yeah, okay."""
Nope.
He's real.
And he's really all right?
"No, I'm gonna marry some douchebag."
"Uh, hello?"
He's a good guy.
"Well, he better be."
He is.
He's good with the boys.
He likes my mother.
He likes your mother?
Sober?
Go figure.
Pain in the ass.
"Well, you know, if I don't like him, this whole thing is off."
Right.
Seriously.
Okay.
"Better, right?"
You know it's better.
"Mmm, mmm."
Fuck ratings.
I don't care about ratings.
"Well, that's easy to say..."
Charlie's taking care of it.
"Come on, come on!"
"Dale, Dale..."
Dale!
CHARLIE:
"This is 2-11 to base, 2-11 to base."
I need an ambulance out here on Sulphur Springs road right away.
That son of a bitch nailed him.
Yeah.
Dale?
"Hey, man, hey."
Hang in there.
I've got an ambulance on the way.
"I'm going to run in the house and get you some blankets, okay?"
"Are you dead, mister?"
Hmm?
"Are you dead, mister?"
"No, not quite."
Where's the lady at?
She's over there.
"Don't go away, come back."
Come back here and stay with me.
Yeah.
Just stay here with me.
How did you get the blood on yourself?
I got in a fight.
(GROANING)
What do you do with your keys?
Oh...
I lock things up.
Come here.
I can't see your face.
"No, no, no, no."
Fired?
"Wait, no."
Don't fire him.
Look.
See?
I'm moving it.
I'm moving the cable.
I'm moving...
Get him out of here.
Stan.
"Stan, don't do this, please."
Not now.
Okay?
Come on.
"It's too late, Billy."
I'm sorry.
I'm apologizing.
Mr. Logan has been terminated.
I don't want him back in the building.
You make sure you get his security pass and keys.
Get him out of here!
Stan.
Listen to me.
"It was my fault, too."
I tripped over the cable.
I...
"Natalie, this is not about you."
I've been warning this guy all summer.
"Come on, people!"
Let's get that stage reset.
Make it look good.
- Is my brother going to die?
"- No, he is not!"
"No, he is not!"
- What are you doing?
- I'm a doctor.
I need to clear an airway.

A pen?
Do you have a pen on you?
Here we go.

All right.
Come on.

Come here.
Help me out.
"Get him up, get him up."
I got him.
I got him.
- What do you got?
- A 12-year-old trapped in a culvert.
Possible fracture to the left lower extremity.
Don't jostle him.
He's hypothermic.
You can cause an arrhythmia.
I'm Dr. Ross.
I work in County ER.
I need a number six ET tube.
There we go.
- I need a portable O-2 and an ambu-bag.
You know?
I'm really lucky you became my husband.
Really?
Well now is the start of our new life.
Oh come on!
You're so handsome!
And you...
You're the fairest of them all!
Promise me that it'll only be me.
You're the only one I will love.
Promise me that you won't leave me.
I'll always be here by your side.
"You're my life, Migs."
"I love you, Joy."
"Here, I've already prepared it because I knew you were coming."
-Nice.
-There you go.
Is it nice?
.
Thank you.
-Hey Migs!
Your change!
-Buy load instead!
Thank you Migs!
-Joy!
Stay here first.
-What happened?
-We'll take care of that.

It's too low.
-Why did you come inside?
-Alex please!
Stay up.
Stay up!

Hank Aaron beats Babe Ruth.
That's nothing.
That's an easy one.
Here we go.
Are you ready?
"Okay, we got it."
We got it.
"All right, come here."
- You gotta push your leg out.
Ready?

"All right, here we go."
"All right, buddy."
It's okay.
Come here.
Come here.
"All right, listen, give me your hands."
You gotta hold on right here.
Hold on with both hands.
You hold on!
You gotta keep your head up above water.
Do you understand?
"- Yes, you do."
- I can't....
- I can't hold....
- I'll knock out these hinges.
- I can't.
Thanks.
- Nice isn't it?
- Yes.
Can we go out and try?
Yes?
Yes?
What is it?
- Can you help us?
- Yes.
What is it about?
- Are you a priest?
"- No, I'm the sexton."
Where is the priest?
He is not here.
- Can we call him?
- Yes.
Of course that's possible.
You can go with us to the police station?
And talk to the agent and explain to him?
No problem.
Open the door!
Get out!
Come one!
Thanks.
Don't you owe me any explanation?
It was all a little bit too much.
The accident.
The divorce.
What is this?
What is this?
Where is our mother?
I'm going crazy.
I don't know what to do.
I...
I need to talk to you.
I...
"Hey, Marie."
It's me.
What's up?
Yesterday I got home and found him.
He didn't even tell me he was coming.
- A man was killed?
"- A Federale, right in front of him."
"Three agents wounded, one lost his leg."
It's like what you hear about from Iraq or something.
- The IEDs.
"- Oh, Jesus."
I had to hear about it from Steve Gomez.
Hank talked to his ASAC for about an hour.
Hank could win an Oscar.
He's so damn breezy with the man.
"He hangs up the phone, goes right back to bed."
"And all he keeps saying is, ""I'm fine."
I'm fine.
"Leave me alone."""
"Baby, not now."
It's...
"It's me, Hank."
Sorry.
"Hey, buddy."
What's.?
What's up?
I just...
Do you mind if I.?
You can't tell me I'm not paying for it.
What do you want?
"Coke, speed, anything."
You might as well have the good stuff.
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Leave me.
Just get away from here.
Get help.
Get help.
"Paul, Paul, Paul..."
"Stop being so bloody noble, okay?"
Fuck!
"Help me, please!"
"Make an effort, Paul, please!"
"Hey, Mr. Gimp."
"Hey, Mr. Gimp."
"Still got one bullet left, soldier boy."
Use it.
Good idea.
You're magnificent.
I'm not finished yet.
Let's just go.
I want a word with Felix first.
He's crippled now.
He's bloody paralysed.
Just let him be.
"- Wait in the car, Paul."
I won't be long
"- No, no."
"Just go, please."
Here you go.
Thanks.
Hey.
You come here a lot?
"Yeah, 2 or 3 times a week."

It's so dark here.

Come in.
Can you milk the cow for me?
"Wait, I'll do it."
It's so dark.
How can you milk in here?
I'm used to it. I work here.
You'll get used to it if you stay.
I'll be gone before I get used to it.

It'll be about a week.
All of a week.

"If he'd have turned around, Frank, they'd have hanged us for it."
"And something, something put that cop there."
"It's an act of God, those lights went out."
Don't look back.

-Don't look back.
It's a cop.

Right now!
What are you doing?
It's the middle of the night.
Who are you?
"- No, I'm fine."
Go away.
- Go where?
She has a lot built up inside her.
Let's stay quiet for a bit.
I'm just here to look for a friend.
"Alright, I'll be quiet."
Your friend is in this room?
"Then, why are you screaming?"
Everyone's in bed at this hour.
You have to be quiet.
"Okay, sir, I'm sorry."
It's empty.
Come on over.
"Here, take this."
"- Careful, careful."
- Okay.
Slowly.
Oh no.
"Good, good."
Go ahead.
"Quiet, quiet."
Where am I?
Where is this?
Let me just finish.
My skin is way lighter than yours.
Okay.
Just wait.
You'll see.
I just have to do your whole face first.

Seeya.
Guy at 1:00.
Not cute.
Say hi.
Hi.
Hi.
- That doesn't match your skin color.
- I know.
It doesn't.
"Do you want me to finish, or do you want me to leave it how it is?"
Are you guys like girlfriends?
Maybe.
You look like you could be sisters.
- Maybe we're sisters and girlfriends.
"- Yeah, that'd be pretty cool."
But that's pretty unlikely.
- How old are you guys anyways?
- Eighteen.
I'm 18.
She's 17.

"Hey, asshole!"
You bastard!
Take off your helmet!
You want to kill me?
Kill me!

"Consider yourself lucky, asshole."
What are you looking at?
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.
- How about you?
- I'm fine.
- Let's get out of here.
"- Yeah, let's."
- Were you surprised?
"Well, what do you think?"
Yeah...
Go ahead...
She's all yours.
Whas wrong?
No good?
I can't get it up.
Angelras!
I have to get off now.
He doesn't know what he's in for!
We sure warmed her up!
What about me?
Why can't I get it up?
The bastard!
I sure hope he gets his...
"Right on a nice, sharp curve..."
Think he's got his car back?
You're nuts!
Not yet!
What are cops for?
Where's the fire?
I can't wait!
Hope he's on the accident list!
Know anyone here?
So why'd we come?
Give me time to think!
I'm not a computer!
Just take it easy.

"Watch where you go, girl!"
"Lady, you made me lose my lovebird."
I want you to be my kept bird now.
Return the bird to him.
"Lady, come home with me now."
I'll treat you well.
Now's your chance to impress Sifu.
Go and settle this.
Be brave.
Go.
"Come on, let's go."
Take her home.
"Hey, don't be a bully!"
Your bird is here!

I thought you're the masked killer.
You're the biggest coward I've ever seen.
Dry the clothes!

Why?
It's a waste of effort.
This is our family secret.

It's not practical.
Get it.
Who dropped these money?
Money?

"I tell you all about it tomorrow, but now I got many people to call."
You be there.
Goodbye.
"Hello, Axel."
Shall I call him back?
No.
I guess not.
He'll be here first thing in the morning.
"Axel, you think I don't know how it is with you?"
"Lisa, please."
No more talk.
"But all day long, you haven't eaten enough for a sparrow."
And now it's late.
Oh.
"[laughing] Oh, that."
We'll go to your place.
I'll make you some supper.
Then you have a good night's sleep.
Look.

I don't understand.
What does that mean?
I'm going to find out.
Maigret!
Maigret!
Maigret!

What's going on out here?
Why you knock my sign down?
You're not the man I knew ten years ago.
"It's not the years, honey, it's the mileage."
You are...
"Please, I don't need a nurse."

- Don't be such a baby.
"Marion, leave me alone."

What is it?
Engines have stopped.
I'm going to go check.

- We have most important friends.
Holy shit.
I sent my man for you.
You and the girl must disappear.
We have a place in the hold.
"Come on, go, go, go."
"Come on, go, my friend, go."
Where is Dr. Jones?
What's the big idea?
Let go!
"I'm not gonna leave, Jenna."
You're gonna have to come talk to me sooner or later.
Go away!
I can't!
I'm sorry.
I can't.
"I love you, and I don't deserve you, but this is our home."
"This is our home, Jenna, and I'm..."
I'm not gonna leave this porch until you talk to me.
Jenna?
Hey.
I'm not coming back.
I'm sorry.
But I'm moving into Kenny's.
I'm still gonna be his dad.
Okay.

"Sir, I would suggest that you get help before you fly again."
"Oh, I'll never be doing that"
- again.
"But I did it, didn't I?"
- Yeah.
Thanks for all your help.
- I did it!
- You did.
Are you up?
"No, I'm here."
Can I come over?
What can I say?
- Thank you.
You saved me.
- So your apartment's ready?
"Yeah, yeah."
They did a great job.
It's better than it was before.
I should've burned it down long ago.
- Ok.
Ok.
- Ok.
"Well, goodbye."
Goodbye.
- I lost the apartment.
- I know.
I don't think I'm capable of taking care of myself right now.
I need help.
I know that's a lot to ask of an ex-wife.
"David, I think that you should sleep in my basement."
Ok?
Come on.
"Oh, angel."
You're the best.
You're the best in the land.
"- Stop, please."
- This is the very best.
The very best girl ever in the whole wide world.

Fine.
"Elias, let's make a deal."
I'll play along again.
I'll talk to Lukas again.
Lukas will be alive.
"I'll make you both breakfast, put out your clothes."
"We'll do things, like before."
But you have to believe me that I'm your mom.
You won't really do that.
I promise.
Elias...
It's not your fault Lukas died.
The accident wasn't your fault.
Do you really believe her?
Hmm?
Hmm?
She's lying.
Let her prove she's our mom.

But I can't see him!

Cosette.
-What?
-Christopher!
(screaming)
"Get off her, let go, let go!"
Pang!
I've been waiting for you!
Get him!
Listen.
Spare my life.
"Last time I spared you, you didn't learn."
It's not my idea.
I disobeyed orders.
Who's orders?
Talk!
We're all hired.
Who by then?
"Lun, Lun Sanye."
(groaning)
(whipping)
(going ringing)
The great whip.
Good.
Great whip.
That's some great throwing.
But I'll never be able to do anything as good as he does.
Sanye!
What's wrong?
"Wide-Eye, Tiger-Wang and Playboy, all of them killed by that young kid!"
What?
Where is he now?
"He's out front, fighting like mad with our men."
Let's go.
No.
Like this.
"I thought this makeup thing was gonna be hard enough, but now-- ok."
Like what?
Um...
Your accent.
My accent?
"It's a little thick, honey."
"Ok, well, what the hell am I supposed to do?"
It's the way I talk.
"""Talk."" See?"
"That right there, ""talk."""
So what are you saying?
"After 7 years all of a sudden, my accent bothers you?"
It's not a question of it bothering me.
"I mean, look, are you smart?"
Sure.
Do you sound smart?
[Grunting]
O-ok.
"Um, so what else?"
Your laugh.
My laugh?
Yeah.
Ha!
"Well, I thought people think my laugh is fun."
"Yes, if you think loud, scary noises are fun."
O-ok.
So what else?
What else?
Nothing else.
Come on.
Tell me!
There's nothing else!
"Alright, Julie."
"- Happy birthday, son!"
- Happy birthday!
Cheers!
Sorry
Don't be sorry.
Are you OK?
I love you.
Me too.
"Mom, I'm just gonna go say 'hi' to Danny, okay?"
Two secs.
"Hey man, you OK?"
"- Yeah, I'm sorry I'm late."
- It's alright mate.
"Yeah listen, I need to talk to you about something."
Alright then.
What is it?
It is a...
There's a case I'm working on.
It's a murder.
And we've found something at the scene.
What?
It's blood but it's not the victim's.
We ran some DNA tests and there's a match.
"Mark, it's Jesse."
"The DNA, it's Jesse."
He's alive.
- So you're saying he's a murderer?
"- No, nobody is saying anything."
"20 years, 20 years, what the hell!"
I don't know.
Nobody knows.
Let him go away.
-Get away.
"- OK, guys, off I go."
Go away!
What crap they consume!
"When he comes to his senses, he'll take us directlyto her."
Do you still think a lady sniper is after us?
This sucker smells of a woman.
A lucky one.
Bitches!
Dirty scum!
Smelly beasts!
I'll tearyou to pieces.
You thought you'd finished Malakhov off!
Up yours!
Dirty scum!
Beasts.
Up yours.
Fuck you.
Get down!
Mines!
Get down!
Mines!
Get down!
Where are you going?
Get down!
"Come here, I'll kill you."
I'll kill you.
Olya!
Olya!
-You are alive!
"Alive, Olenka!"
What did you tell her?
"Nothing, that it was progressing."
Progressing?
What is?
Eating strawberries is work.
- She didn't want any?
- No.
The strawberries are better in Tehran.
"Fresh air, fresh milk."
I haven't seen any milk.
We're not allowed milk here.
He's right.
Don't be long.
Don't go too far!
"No, we're just here."
Good-bye.
I have bread for you.
Are you well?
Thank you.
That's kind.
You're welcome.
- How are you?
- l'm okay.
How is she?
Who?
You still ask who?
She's well.
- She's well?
- Yes.
How do you know?
My mother went to see her.
And?
- She gonna be okay in there?
Put that down!
"No, come on, come on!"
"Jess, wait!"
"Let's just talk about this, okay?"
Hold on.
"No, that's mine."
You can't take that!
"Jess, hold up."
What are you doing?
I got it!
"It's really heavy, but I got it!"
"Oh, my God, we created a monster."
- She looks like Helena Bonham Carter.
"- Oh, gosh."
"- Soft hands, Jess."
"- Jess, come on, let's share it."
"- You know, work out a system."
- Hey.
"Hey, that's my shirt."
"- No, this is my T-shirt."
- That is my shirt.
It has my name on it.
- Don't drop it.
"Jess, don't..."
"- Come on, everybody out now."
- Give me my shirt!
- I like this shirt.
"Hey, Jess, no, no, no, stop."
- Don't mind us.
We're just here for the TV.
- Who are these guys?
- Max is gone?
- Yeah.
I see you flirt with all the ladies here.
Why not?
- [Laughs]
- That's good.
- Is it?
- Make her happy and you ha -
You know what?
You're absolutely right.
That's what does it.
- I love it.
- So you do that to make other people happy.
- Oh yeah.
- That's
-That's nice.
- If you want to.
- Mm-hmm.
Some people don't like women.
I love 'em!
[Laughs]
Look at that smile.
Your eyes are starting to -
What are they starting to do?
Tear?
- They make you feel good.
- [Chuckles]
- Do you like it?
"- Oh, you must have been some devil when you were younger."
- I was never a devil.
"- Aw, I don't know."
"- You don't like me, eh?"
So let 'em wait.
Get rid of the cigar.
- Why?
- Because I said so.
That was a new cigar.
You stay here.
"If anything happens, whistle."
- Whistle?
- Don't you understand?
- What's wrong?
- Let me outta here!
Hey!
Shut up!
Let me out!
I gotta get outta here!
I want out!
I gotta get out!
Out of the way!
"Come on, let's go!"
That's not one of ours!
- It's a different car!
- Someone squealed on us!
Looks like the police!
Police?
Push him out!
- He won't squeal on us again!
- He'll slow down the cops.
I told you he'd be trouble.
"What was that, Karl?"
It's an awful road.
You can't see a thing.
- Who's there?
Stuck in her throat.
- She's a vegetable.
The Gimp has to feed her three times a day.
He has to wipe her.
She shits like crazy.
"Well, she does."
"Diapers don't come in ""size Bodil""."
She needs a double diaper.
- I'm off.
- Give her my best.
"You don't get it, Claire."
Bodil is..!
You can't get through.
She ate a fruit and turned into a vegetable.
- An olive isn't a fruit.
It's a nut.
"- No, an olive is a fruit."
- Anything above ground is a fruit.
- Chestnuts aren't fruit.
- Yes.
"- No, they're nuts."
- Nuts are fruit.
"- No, they aren't."
"Yes, they are."
Glad we got that straightened out.
- There's more if you...
- Thank you.
"Oh no, Bodil..."
- The meat balls are good.
- It's Bodil's recipe.
But I bought the peas.
- I'm going to put Bodil in a home.
"We need to jump on now, guys."
Come on.
Hobos do this everyday.
I don't understand it.
Cliff!
You think my name is Cliff?
"Oh, my God, I love it."
I'm Cliff now.
Call me Cliff.
"No, just to clarify:"
Cliff!
We have to get on that train now!
We're running out of dry land!
I have to go back for my bandana.
It's made of cotton!
Leave it!
Leave it!
"Oh, damn it!"
You chose chocolate.
It's what your bandana
I guess.
"Oh, no."
Now my overalls are stuck.
What's going on with my outfit?
"Do something, Gene!"
He's almost here!
Aah!
We have to hide the chocolate.
Oh...
Where are we going to hide it?
I don't know.
"Oh, no."
And live off what?
The Lord will provide.
I'm still waiting for the Lord to provide me with a new thresher.
I'd love to travel someday.
And I bet you will.
I could drop out of school.

I'll do it.

I wanna travel.
Son.

This is the perfect plan.

I can't thank you enough for this.

We're gonna be fine.
It's gonna be okay.

"Five agents in the East Gate, four in the garden."
The rest should be on the South Lawn.
And two policemen on the South Gate.

Keep moving!
Shots fired.
Code Black!
Code Black!
- Say again.
Say again.
"- He said ""shots fired."""
"Look, it's gotta be an AOP."
You gotta get out there.
- Stand back.
- I'm not doing anything.
You serious?
Look around.
- Stand back!
- The threat is out there!
Go out and do your job!
"Donnie, where'd you send my daughter?"
I'm sure she's fine.
We're in the safest house in the world.
"Well, not today, it's not."
Aah!
You're dead!
"You better not touch me, Sonny Curley!"
I've witnesses!
What did you do to him?
Nothing!
I just gave him a piece of advice!
I dare ya.
I bleeding' dare ya.
I told him to stop fiddling' with himself... when he thought there was no one looking!
I'll batter you!

You heard me.
"Oh, my Jesus."
"You're pregnant, you said?"
Yeah.
"That's lovely, that is."
You sure?
Yeah.
Sort of.
How much did you see?
"Don't worry, I won't tell."
So you saw everything.
No big deal.
It's not the first time.
What?
Here.
What?
It's okay.
Have a sip.
Hurry up!
Son of a bitch!
What took you so long?
Ignoring my calls?
My mother-in-law got sick.
Now you're using your mother-in-law as an excuse?
"You were taking a nap, I can tell!"
"No, I wasn't."
I swear.
Get to work.
"Excuse me, ma'am?"
What the hell?
What are you doing?
Stop her.
"Yes, sir."
"Come with me, ma'am."
Get off me!
"Sergeant, get her out of here."
"Back off, people."
What's wrong with her?
"Please, calm down."
That idiot...
"You'll be back on Monday, right?"
Not for three weeks?
Thailand?

Say hi to dad.
'Bye.
I want to cancel my card.
It got stolen tonight.
Where is your friend?
Just get it over with.
Stay down.
Is that all you've got?
Hi.
Hi.
How are you feeling?
Fine.
I'm sorry I was such a jerk.
I've felt weird lately.
Are you feeling better now?
It was a crazy night.
Maybe too crazy.
What happened to your face?
Nothing I didn't ask for.
It's Marc.
There's an after-party at Peter Skjoldmark's.
Maybe we should just stay here.
I'm quite tired.
Marc's got coke.
Come on.
I'll look after you.
Can I come back to your place afterwards?
I can't go home.
What?
I'm not pretty no more.
You are beautiful.
You hear me?
Why did he have to come back?
I wish he could have just stayed up there.
You could have married Hector.
You're just saying that.
"You're just saying that, okay?"
*
"You all right, B.?"
Huh...
"oh, yeah."
"I'm shakin', I'm shaking."
"Nah, I'm just getting started though."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
You ain't won nothin' all day.
Come on...
"That's what I'm talking about, yo."
What's good?
"How you doin', can I get in?"
My money good?
"Yeah, fuck it."
All right.
Cuanto?
"$100. a game, man."
$100.?
"Man, roll 'em, man, roll them dice, dude."
Shaking them down ain't gonna make no difference.
"(Man) All right, watch me."
"Come on six... here we go, baby, here we go."
"Four, five, six..."
"Okay, guys, we'll let him go and take her."
Out!
I'm also poor.
That's not true.
"She owns a ten story building, a farm and livestock."
That's enough!
- We'll take her.
- Yes...
"And you, douche bag, take off your pants."
"Yes, yes."
I'll take them off right away...
- I can't.
- Why not?
I crapped myself.
Drop your pants.
Now!
Faster!
Pig!
Wimp!
Put on the hood.
- No!
"- Put on the hood, bitch."
- No!
- Dammit...
Let go of me!
Help her down.
We are gentlemen.
We won't do anything to a woman.
"Come on, get out."
Count to one hundred and take off the hood.
Let's go!
Miss...
Don't do this.
What happened is not on you.
I was supposed to have his back.

It's a little new to me.
For me too.
Didn't you know I existed?
I'm sorry.
You shouldn't say sorry.
You're the only one who can't be blamed.

"Um, I'm sorry."
What was it like?
[Sighing]
Um... it was bad.
"Not as bad as New York City, but it was bad."
"Hey, mama."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
"All right, grandma, let's hand it over."

"- Right, we're not having sex."
Why don't we go inside?
Want me to cook you some hot soup?
I have the ingredients in my room.
Hot soup?
"Yeah, maybe with bean sprouts."
I'm a great cook.
But your friend may be sleeping now.
Who cares?
I can really cook well!
Sure.
Want to try something?
I saw somebody doing it before.

You've got to look smart for your date.
What if we fail?
Don't worry!
Keep your cool!
I'll give you a chance to save her.
How?
The masked killer that you most scared at will appear to-night.
Huang...you want to hit me?
No.
I was trying to get this mosquito.
Don't be afraid...
Let me teach him a lesson.
Ward me off!
Kick me!
How?
A kick below the belt!
You've kicked at the wrong place.
I knew that.
So we're going to Dallas.
Together.
But first  we sleep.

That's convenient.
- What?
- Where?
"Uh, town."
I'm meeting some friends.
How are you getting there?
"Well, I was hoping to get a ride from either Grandpa or Taylor, but obviously that's a no-go."
Or we miss our chance to cross.
Please.
You have to.
Please.
Please.

They make you look younger.

I got a long ride for some good money... we're gonna get outta here.
We're gonna drive down to Yelapa.
We're gonna get ourselves a boat.
And we're gonna go live on the ocean.
Will you be safe there?
Yeah.
We'll be safe.
Charles.
Be back in a few days.
Shit.

What happened?
Did something go wrong?
The job was wrong to begin with.
Logan!
Logan!

Who does this belong to?
Who's that?
Thought you were supposed to see shit coming.
I can track mutants.

En garde!
Wilbur!
(ALL EXCLAIMING)
Wilbur!
See?
"Oh, no!"
"Oh, no, spare me, sir."
Give me that.
"Oh, please, spare my life."
Be a good boy!
"Oh, thank you."
"Thank you, sir."
Thank you very much.
Kill you!
"And you, men, take the helm and take over!"
It's not loaded!
(WOMEN SCREAMING)
That's the signal!
"Board the boat, men!"
"Board the boat, men!"
"All right, rocket service!"
Let's drink a toast.
That was a successful voyage.
Throw it down!
No!
Throw it down!

Oh!
Call the meeting to order.
Young man!
- Why did you do it?
- He was blackmailing Mumsie...
- Ethel!
"Good night, Constable."
- Good night.
"Once he's in the pond, we'll go to the barge and destroy the cabinet's contents."
- Can't we do it without killing him?
- Of course not.
He'd just hide himself away and write it all over again.
Of course we must kill him.
Whoops!
Steady.
We mustn't hurt him.
"Come along, Ethel."
Give us a hand.
Come along!
We'll tip him out from here.
"Come along, Ethel."
Right.
Up.
There!
Give him a pull.
Come on.
Botheration!
He's stuck.
You'll have to launch him!
"Come along, Ethel!"
Shh!
You'll wake him!
Shh!
"Hurry, girl."
Hurry!
We don't connect on a single thing.
It's over.
It's not...
G...
"Look, Carly, I gotta tell you something."
I just...
I don't see a future here.
"Oh, my God."
Are you dying?
"Oh, that is so hot."
Wait.
Is that R2-D2?
Do you like Star Wars?
I love Star Wars.
Me too.
"I mean, I've only seen the new ones."
Close enough.
- So?
- Yeah.
I knew it!
I could feel it.
It's almost like we were hooking up with her together.
"You felt that, right?"
- I couldn't have performed if I did.
"- Don't you see, Ted?"
We had a bronnection.
"All right, I gotta know what she looks like."
Show me a picture.
"Well, normally, I'm above such things, but it's been a while, and, uh, Teddy's braggin'."
"Uh, here she is."
Okay.
Scrolling up.
"I was in the blouse, too!"
"She was there, too."
I see.
That's all right.
"You aren't hurt, are you?"
"I'll tell you, if I'm hurt."
She'll tell us.
Let me take a look.
What are you doing?
Will she cook for me?
What misbehaviour is this!
Go away!
Just go away...!
Don't forget!
I own the place!
And you owe me the rent!
And you're driving me out!
Don't misunderstand me!

I've got to know your secret.
Really?
What secret?

Thanks.
You can start tomorrow?
You want a drink?
Come on.

you're at the right place.
Do you know a place where I could stay?
Stay here until you find something better.
It will be fine.
Thanks.
I'll let you unpack.
You want a drink?
I don't think this is a good idea.
Here.
Cheers.
I'm gonna go.
Just relax.
What is it?
Camille is here.
What?
She says she loves you.
She misses you.
She misses Léna too.
What happened to her wasn't your fault.
Tell her I love her.
She's gone.
I am not crazy.
- Leave me.
"Let me go, you psycho."
I'm not..
I'm not psycho.
You don't believe me.
Come here.
Just let me go.
Look!
Look at them.
"That's you, age 6."
Right?
And this one...
Look at this..
"This is you, age 18."
I tried.
The nose is a little..
What are you saying?
I have never met you before.
- But the smile is the same.
- You're crazy.
"- Saira, am I right?"
- I have to go just...
- I'm going to call the cops.
I'm going to..
- Saira!
Saira!
Don't you want answers to your dreams?
It will take some time.
But you will understand everything.
"And until then, be my guest."
It's perfect.
It could end up being a hit.
We'll see.
Step by step.
"Yes, step by step."
So...
"Good night, Yitzhak."
Good night.
Get up.
Daddy.
What's wrong?
- Why didn't you get up?
What time is it?
Five after ten.
I gave you the alarm clock.
I forgot to set it.
"We're late, that's not good."
"No, it's not."
Get up.
Good morning.
"Please tell Alex we're running a bit late, we'll be right there, I just can't get a cab."
"It's Goni, Yitzhak Ben-Shmuel's daughter, I'm sorry."
Yes.
"Okay, then don't bother Alex about it."
"Okay, we'll be right there."
What are you doing?
I have to take my pills.
Come on!
Would you please hurry up?
I'm almost ready.
All I need is my shoes.
Alex.
Goni.
"Happy Birthday, Linda!"
"Oh, it is my birthday..."
"Don't worry, I'm gonna get you out of here."
Yay!
And then I'm gonna eat you.
No...!
Shush!
Where is she?
She should be out there by now!
Who's that?
I don't know... it's too early for Ethan to come back.
Aah!
I'm not decent!
Come back later!
Thank you!
I must use the kerplunker!
There's a line for the other one.
Make it fast.
"Don't tell me, make it fast."
Just go.
"Don't tell me, just go."
Just da... ah...
Make some noise.
Sing songs or something.
"Look, look..."
look at the legs on the glass.
You see the legs?
I see fe... it looks like feet.
"Oh, Linda."
"You're such a sweet, simple person."
Thanks.
"Wait, what?"
I'll care of it tomorrow.
Christine!
Anything I should know?
You come and go...
We cross paths.
I have a lot of work.
I have work too.
We managed before.
There's nothing.
If you want to talk...
I'm looking for Gilles.
Alain!
Gilles went to London.
Andrew knows Leslie's parents.
This is his place.
He's back for the trimester.
It wasn't planned.
His kids are coming.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
When did Gilles leave?
Last week.
I wrote him.
I know.
I don't have his address.
I'll forward the letter once I do.
- A number?
- We can't call him.
He calls.
You left Jean-René?
You can spend the night.
No thanks.
I'd rather not.
"Yes, please."
I'd be grateful for some fresh milk.
All right.
I'm disturbing you.
Don't worry.
- Are you well?
"- Yes, thank you."
What a fine house.
Make yourself at home.
is this Kakrahman's house?
No.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
I was told to get milk from him.
It's next door.
Where is Kakrahman's house?
Next door.
"Sorry, I didn't understand."
It's next door.
Thank you very much.
is this Kakrahman's house?
Welcome.
Good luck.
I was sent here for milk.
Can you give me some?
Go down to the cellar...
Watch your head.
This way?
Go on down.
Mind your head.
All right.
Why is it so dark here?
"There's a hurricane lamp, it's not dark."
"Yeah, I'm always in a good mood."
Like when?
Like always.
Like the night you were born.
- And then... today.
- Yep.
Okay.
Off you go to school.
"Bye, darling."
I love you so much.
"- Bye, Mom."
- Bye.
"See you later, alligator."
"- Good morning, Christine."
- Good morning.
"Good morning, ladies."
What's wrong?
You're smiling.
What do you mean?
I always smile.
No.
No you don't.
"No, it's something else."
Wait a minute-- did you have sex?
"Marly, I think you're right."
"Look, her neck muscles have relaxed and she's not doing that crazy thing with her eyes."
Admit it.
Maybe I did... and maybe I didn't.
You did.
When did you get a boyfriend?
"You don't need a boyfriend to have sex, Peggy Sue."
"Oh, yes."
Under duress.
Please hold.
"Blackleg Miner, what's going on?"
Terminal was compromised.
What's your status?
Terminal secure.
I knew you wouldn't let me down.
Numbers secure?
Of course.
That's all that matters.
Yeah.
And the girl?
All assets retired.
She's dead?
Yes.
"All right, then."
Get out!
Get out of the car!
"Hey, don't shoot, don't shoot."
I got money.
I don't want your fucking money.
Help me get her in the car.
We gotta get into town.
We need to get to a hospital.
- What happened to her?
- She's shot?
- Shot?
Out here?
- Help me!
Help me get her in.
"Okay, come on."
"Come on, come on, come on."
- I'll be fine.
- You come with me.
You first.
I'm right behind you.
Miss Voss.!
Miss Voss.!
"Okay, stay down."
"Oh, you're a lucky girl."
You're a lucky girl.
Just get behind the door there.
Just get right behind the door there.
We will take care of him.
Don't worry.
"Boy, I hope he tries something now."
"Come on, Hammond."
Just give me one reason.
"Way to go, Jack."
Way to go.
"Come on, Hammond!"
You're in a no-win situation!
Put your hands out of the car where I can see them!
"- Stand up, Hammond.!"
Stand up.!
- Get up.!
"Turn around, turn around.!"
Turn around.!
Hands on your head.!
On your head.!
You know the drill.
- You got him?
You got him.
"- We got you now, my friend."
"It's true, he freed me."
You dug a hole in the wall.
And I also have a job.
Oh!
What a tall tale!
"""If you think the night is nice, the day will be worse. """
Balla is a liar.
I'm not crazy.
Believe me!
Balla is a joker.
It's been a long time.
Haven't seen you around lately.
Is it ready?
Yes.
Let's celebrate the reunion.
Where?
Come sit with me.
They're waiting for me.
I'm in a rush.
"So, don't forget:"
"- Tuesday, at ""3 Caïmans""."
- All right!
We'll have a good time.
- How much is it?
- 1200 FM.
Where are you going tonight?
"To the ""3 Caïmans""."
We could go together.
"You need to rest, you've had a hard day."
Sure!
There's always an excuse.
"- All right, then, get dressed!"
What was the matter with you?
"I don't know, exactly... but..."
I need help.
Don't go any closer.
Why?
"What is it, Tony?"
"Tony, stop it!"
"Stop it, Tony, stop it!"
Exert a force greater than hers.
"Why are you doing this, Tony?"
Stop.
Crush her.
Kill her!
Crush her!
Crush her!
Crush her!
Finish her!
Now!
Tia.
Where are we?
What's happened?
Tony.
"Tony, we can still do it."
We can still make use of molecular control.
"OK, doc, let's do it."
Letha!
"Why don't we all go and have some... some candy and, uh, sodas and ice cream?"
Next time...
- ...next time I'll...
- Forget it.
I've lost my faith in science.
Sickle!
She brought me some milk.
There.
Do you want me to give you some?
"No, thank you kindly."
She brought it for you.
I think Farhad dug Biston on his own.
Do you know him?
Yes.
"He's a local, he lives three miles away."
A local?
Well done.
But it wasn't Farhad who dug Biston.
I know.
Who then?
It was love.
The love of Shirin.
Bravo.
You know love too.
A man without love cannot live.
How are you?
I'm okay.
Where are you going?
"As usual, we're going to eat strawberries."
- Where's Jahan?
"- Sleeping, as usual."
You'll bring him back?
"You know, he doesn't eat strawberries."
Who called?
- Mrs Godarzi.
- What did she say?
Greetings.
She wanted news.
Not red.
"Ok, bye."
Hey.
Sounds like we got here just in time.
"How can we help, maid of honor?"
I am so late.
Talk to Seven.
I'll be right back.
Hello.
Hello.
"3... 2, 1."
My keys.
Thank you.
"3... 2, 1."
And the picture.
"Oh, thanks."
I'm gonna follow her.
Make sure she makes it all the way to the elevator and out the front door.
Today's the big day!
"Ok, so the funny thing about pantyhose is, there isn't a... tag."
How do you tell which way...
is the front?
You really can't with these things.
Hi.
Is there a beautiful bride in here?
"Oh, look at you."
Nice suit.
"Oh, shut up."
You're the one who looks beautiful.
It's your day.
Gosh.
"Becca, what the hell are you doing?"
"This is going to be great, he'll get such a kick from this."
"Good stuff, Dermot."
Are you ready and settled?
Yeah.
Sid?
Yeah.
"Hi, Sid, how are you?"
"All right, yeah."
"I know we haven't met, I'm Dermot."
"Good, good."
You're the new lad?
I am.
"I'm Dermot, how are you?"
Good.
Good to meet you.
Yeah.
It's your last day.
Is it?
Yeah.
"No, it's not."
"No, shall I..."
"You're leaving, aren't you?"
You what?
"You're leaving and Sleet said I've got to sort of like, you know, just give you a surprise and give you presents for your daughter."
"Well, I'm not..."
There we go.
Wonderful.
"OK, then he's written some words for you."
"Yeah, go on."
"Yeah, this'll be good."
What?
Go on.
Me making dinner while you vacuum the rug?
Exactly.
And here's the other thing.
"If I let you take a night off, I have to let everybody take a night off."
Who's everybody?
What are you talking about?
It's just me.
"Mr. Monk, come on."
It's one night.
"Well, then"
I'll guess i'll just have to say no...
Kay.
No kay.
No kay.
Which is it?
"""No"" or ""okay?"""
Nokay.
Noookay.
He's trying to say okay.
That's as close as he's ever gonna get.
No kay.
- Nokay.
- I'll do it.
Nokay.
- She looks nervous.
"- I don't care, as long as she's lucky."
- Is it too much?
- You look great.
"Excuse me, new girl."
"New girl, you're off your mark."
- My mark?
"- Yeah, the big ""X"" on the floor."
"Your Sharon, like?"
Yeah.
"Gas, isn't it?"
But she's not married.
I know that.
Who did the damage?
We don't know.
She won't tell us.
"You'd want to find out, wouldn't you?"
"Excuse me, compadre."
What's it to you who it was?
I couldn't give a shite who it was.
"I'm not gonna buy the food, the nappies... or the little bleedin' track suits."
Dessie is!
I am in me hole!
Hang on a sec.
"Maybe I will, what?"
"Ah, so what?"
I don't care.
It's only a baby.
"Snapper, what?"
Compadre...
I can let you have some very good baby clothes.
Mucho goodo stuff.
Benetton.
- Ha ha!
Benetton.
- Very competitive price.
"Sorry, lads."
Will you take a few of these raffle tickets off me?
What for?
This.
- Mm-hmm.
"- Well, see you after lunch."
"- Right, Bob."
Later.
"- You're going down, right?"
"- Oh, yeah."
Down.
No place to eat up there.
"Why don't I, just press the button again?"
"- Oh, thanks, Bob."
See you soon.
- Right.
Later.
See you then.
"Uh, this elevator's broken."
You'll have to use that one.
"Well, that's about it for me, Bob."
"I'll be, moving along now."
- Right.
- Right.
"Hey, Bob?"
What are you doing for lunch?
"I'm doing it, Jerry."
Where are you going?
I'd better not tell.
I don't think you want to know.
Go ahead Jerry.
It won't bother me.
"Well, I'm going to a new smorgasbord place:"
Mr. Bulk.
They got all-you-can-eat for an hour.
- That's it.
Huh?
"Well, seems we still mean more to him than- than that old memory."
Yeah.
"Hey, hey, wait a minute."
You better come inside before you change your mind.
"Come on, tough guy."
Come on.
"All right, kid, shake it up."
Shake it up.
"Oh, that's grand music."
Yes.
That's grand music.
"Aw, that's grand music."
Yeah.
That's grand music.
That's lovely.
Come on.
Shake it up.
All right.
You tired?
Hmm?
"All right, come on now."
Let's pull.
Together.
"One, two..."
- three-
- Oh!
"Well, we weren't together."
"- Oh, I wish you hadn't."
- Why not?
I haven't let myself think about us.
- I didn't dare.
- Can you feel me squeezing your hand?
- A little.
Good.
All right.
Now all you gotta do is just think warm thoughts.
You gotta think Hawaii and you gotta think the Sahara Desert.
You gotta think about....
Come here!
Come on!
You listen to me.
You gotta stay awake!
"You gotta stay awake for me, all right?"
Okay.
All right?
- I'm so tired.
- I know that.
Why don't we just sing a song.
"- You know songs, don't you?"
- No.
"All right, yeah."
Yeah.
"How about ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game""?"
"All right, listen."
Come here.
I've gotta get some help.
- No!
Don't go.
Don't!
- It's okay.
"Please, don't."
"You gotta sing as loud as you can, so I can hear you."
All right?
"I know, I know, I got it."
No phones inside.
"Hey, if it were up to me, I couldn't care less."
Gone.
Done.
Okay?
Should be out by now.
Yeah.
Probably just got a last-minute broadcast.
What?
Nothing.
One sec.
No...
I can't hear.
Okay.
Eardrums.
"- Stay quiet, okay?"
- Okay.
Stay quiet.
Stay here.
"Be quiet, okay?"
Katherine.
- We're clear.
- Are you sure?
We'd know by now if somebody else were in here.
Whose hand is that?
I don't know.
- Can you hear?
- Yeah.
"If they know the code from before, they're gonna come back in."
They're gonna use it again.
"No, the codes change with every shift."
Do you want to see?
- Yes.
- Come along.
- Look at the fun.
- All right.
"- Hey, Go Through!"
- Go Through?
"The voice enters his ear from here, and goes out the other way."
He's deaf.
He can't hear.
Sir!
You want to eat mangoes?
Aam (Mangoes)?
Shall I die?
Go to sleep?
Shall I late (lie down)?
I see...
late...
You mean...
Aam late...
Aam late...
Aha!
You want to eat an Omlette!
Then say so!
I will get it!
"Come, be seated."
- This waiter...
- Forget it. lt's a daily routine.
"- Tell me, where's Baba?"
- He must be on his way.
I swear...if I don't see the two of you together I feel as if life is incomplete.
Pay heed to what I say.
Go.
Please.
Go.
"Hey, Allen."
I'm good.
"I know it's late, but I need to transfer some money."
"Sure, I can hold on a sec."
Seth!
I'm up here!
You get the bus ticket?
You're not going anywhere.
"What are you doing here, man?"
What are you doing with my girlfriend?
Nothing.
Didn't look like nothing.
Tell me.
Or I'll kill you.
Then kill me and quit talking about it.
"Dude, this place is on fire!"
We gotta go!
"Let's go, man!"
Run!
I thought basketball season was over.
"No, this is ESPN Classic."
They play all old games.
It's the Lakers-Pistons.
Right?
1986.
The finals.
Game Seven.
You remember watching this.
You were pregnant... you were pregnant with Marissa when this was on.
He even gave her a fur.
A fur collar?
I gave her that!
The little minx!
Then where is she?
We have to look for her.
"Ah, she'll come back."
"No, you have to look for her."
Me?
I'm not running after no woman.
She'll be back.
- I need a hundred.
- How much?
A hundred.
Watch your step!
You watch yours!
Miss Cilly!
Where's Reinhold?
Pretty as a painted rocking horse!
I'll see you boys later.
"What is it, doll?"
Where's Mieze?
Who?
You know where she is.
I spoke with Franz's landlady.
You were upstairs with Mieze... alone.
Look at me!
I brought Franz to work for you.
Do I have something else on my conscience now?
Tell me!
Do I?
Dumb broad!
We can't live with that.
We should have done what Connor was saying all along.
Play dead.
Go on offence.
Go on offence.
"Blair, I know what you're thinking, but I am putting you first."
"If we don't stop them, we'll never be safe."
"No, I know."
We have to do the right thing.
Hey guys.
Look.
"I know you don't have any reason to trust me right now, but, I think I have a plan."
We should pull a heist on them.
Shit.
What happened?
Tripped.
"Oh, go go go."
Blair.
Okay.
Shit.
First door.
Connor.
Open the door.
I don't know.
Don't just stand there.
C'mon.
Open the door.
Wrong door.
"Wrong door, Connor."
C'mon.
I'm trying.
Hurry.
"- Okay, you're welcome."
Where's your car?
Okay.
I'm gonna wear the hat.
"Oh, you are?"
"This way, ladies."
Okay.
Do I look like a lady?
It's tough to tell in this light.
[ Laughs ]
"Bobby Pin and Rutledge's lost brother had a ram, which was ironic, yet somehow fitting."
"Which door are you getting in, Bob?"
Oh.
I'm in over here.
Are you gonna roll my fat ass in here?
No.
Not if I can help it.
What does that mean?
Are you calling me fat?
I didn't call you fat.
I just agreed with you.
Which word?
We're doing fine.
Leg up.
Okay.
"Wait, where'd my other purse go?"
- Can I have my glasses?
- Sure.
- And my jacket?
- And your jacket.
Okay.
Okay.
"Dads, dads, dads!"
You call me that if you want to call anybody dads!
"You're my kid, see?"
Joey!
"Joe Krozac, jr.!"
"You'll get that into your head right now, or-"
"Please, don't!"
"Don't, Joe!"
You're getting all sick again!
Please!
Guess this will have to wait.
Now you've hurt your sore eye.
Here-
I've got some adhesive in my emergency pocket.
I'll just clean it up a little.
"Here's your medal, Kid."
"I can't now, I'm too busy."
I'll keep it for you.
"Well, we got a croaker."
Always come in handy in our family
"- Eh, kid?"
Huh?
"Oh, yes."
Come on.
"Wake up, kid."
"Come on, Come on, kid."
We got to walk in in style.
Oh-oh!
Honey child!
He's back!
"Oh, my darling's back!"
My boy!
I'm Matt's Elena backup.
I'm your Bonnie backup.
Now it's about me and Bonnie?
You don't get it.
Why would you?
You're everyone's first choice.
Piece of cake.
You know what?
Why don't you guys go ahead and take it for a spin?
- Really?
- Yeah.
Caroline.
You all right?
"- Lf it's not vampires, it's girlfriends."
- Mm.
"All right, roast beef, turkey."
What do you want?
"Oh, let's do the works."
Pile it high.
"All right, I like your style."
Will you grab the bread for me?
Okay.
- What are you doing?
- Just a cut.
Will you hand me that towel?
I can't.
"You got a problem with blood, Anna?"
Mm-mm.
What's the matter?
"It's just blood, Anna."
- What are you doing?
- I knew it.
You can't back out now.
Get the money for the ritual.
Where is she?
At home.
Where else would she be?
I asked the old lady next door to watch her.
You left her alone with a stranger?
Are you out of your minds?
Don't move.
Hyo-jin.
Baby.
- What's the matter?
- Oh my God!
Hyo-jin!
Hyo-jin!
Hyo-jin!
"Drop that, baby."
Don't cry.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It'll be okay.
Quick!
Call 911!
This is all the work of that Jap.
"Ever since we went to his house, my body's been in pain."
I'm burning up.
I'm seeing things.
A man's face comes out of the wall.
I don't think he's alive.
"We've gotta do something, or that bastard will get us first."
Shut the damn door!
What's in that jar?
I do!
I do!
All gone!
That's all... the next one!
Gé!
That's for Gerrit of course!
A real clodhopper's name.
Damn it!
"Christine, my girl..."
She's had...
She's been married twice!
She's been fucking married twice!
Why didn't you tell me?
What a god awful movie... I don't like nature films...
Gé... I've had Gé... I'll try Henk.
Hello Henky!
I'm the first talking goldfish.
Another one!
Another wedding?
She didn't tell me!
Why didn't you tell me?
Three times why didn't you tell me?
Married three times...
What a mess!
I'd prefer porn!
I'm in there too...
"Tiddle-dee, tiddle-door, who is number four?"
"Christine, darling..."
What's this?
What are you doing here?
"Sorry, I thought you were Christine."
The back's the same.
"Oh, OK."
"See you later, Tone."
"Bye, Tony."
Bye.
Fuck!
Take this.
It's stuff.
Maps and shit.
OK.
"You look really good, Tony."
Like you're ready for anything.
Thanks.
See you later.
I'm gonna tell you a story.
"A bloke, he wakes up one morning."
He gets dressed.
He goes down the stairs.
He makes himself a little bit of breakfast.
"He walks to the garage, he gets in his car."
He starts his car.
"Drives off, I don't know, a couple of miles."
Stops.
Gets out his car.
Has a couple of blokes pour petrol over his head and...
Sets fire to himself.
He...
What?
He sets fire to himself.
Fucking boom!
What's in the bag?
My sandwiches.
So what we got?
"Lovely, no way."
"Hey, no one's here."
Hello?
Hello?
This sushi place is really big.
I'm starving.
"Excuse me, is anyone here?"
What the hell?
Are you open?
- Here to eat?
- Yes.
So you're open?
"Yes, we are."
Have a seat.
"Oh, man."
Let's sit.
But where?
Sit here?
Anywhere.
Sit anywhere.
Forget it.
We're leaving.
What's wrong?
"Fuck, learn how to run a business right."
Let's go!
What did you just say?
You should be fucking nice to your customers.
When was I ever not nice?
And why are you swearing at me?
You don't have the right!
You little prick!
Fuck off!
Kaan?
Take Sinan and get out.
Candan is coming out.
I can't believe this.
What was it?
I can't believe it...
I have lost my voice too.
"Try a little harder, Candan."
Hello?
Candan just left.
Okay.
Continue with the operation.
God damn it.
Is it okay?
Did you get it?
"Yeah, you wish."
We are screwed.
It's a different bag.
"What do you mean ""a different bag""?"
I'm saying that it's a different bag.
The old one had 2 digits and this has 3.
Why is she changing her bag?
Okay.
Wait a second.
What is it?
They've finished.
They're leaving.
How are things with you?
It's not good at all.
Try and delay her.
I'm hanging up ...
How am I going to delay her?
Pastures new?
No?
"Anyway, I'm leaving this behind."
Do you want to take it?
What is it?
It's a gramophone.
"Go on, take it."
Who have I to give it to?
No-one.
You.
It's for you.
It's new.
"There's a record in it, Happiness Street."
I'm singing on it.
"All right, Sal?"
What's this?
I'm sailing to Canada.
I've brought him this.
Right.
"I'll send you my address, shall I?"
"Well, I will."
"Jimmy, go and get washed."
"And remember, always hold a record by its edges."
Yes?
"Is this all right, Mam?"
Yeah.
Go on.
"Well, I'll probably not see you."
No.
You know how I'm fixed.
Yeah.
Is she going with you?
You can't face the world?
Why not?
You think I'm a traitor like you!
Traitor?
Help me break his chain.
What chains?
"These chains, of course."
"Gosh, it's broken already!"
Why didn't you tell me before?
What a waste of time!
I should have left you sleep away!
Where's Hiroshima?
B must have chased him into a secret passage!
How do we get in?
I always manage.
Let me try!
Open sesame...!
I get it...!
You can't get me!
"Hiroshima, don't run!"
Bi Boo...!
Bridget!
Bi Boo!
Bi Boo!
What does she mean by that?
A mechanical chair!
Open sesame...!
That's out of fashion.
Watch this.
Bi Boo is the latest password!
Watch me!
Bi Boo!
All right!
I want to finish soon.
"And those crustaceans, known those little ones who do ..."
Yes.
"We do not know swimming, others have fluff."
What?
Fur-sinks.
More is too high.
I have acrophobia.
"Dude, the water is right there, right there!"
I do not care!
It's too cold for me!
"Atticus, for."
He is eating his wing.
Okay.
Let's do this.
Count to three.
Push me in two.
But do not let me know.
"One, two ..."
Why pushed me.
Cute penguins.
But cruel.
Will!
Will!
-What are we looking for?
-This is where're my friend.
I do not know.
"Will, please come back."
I fear the worst.
Also I fear the worst.
Why fear the best is a waste of time.
Angle out.
There you go.
"Show me you can throw one, two, three."
You need to get that elbow over your shoulder.
Not this.
This.
"One, two, three."
- All right?
- Can I do that again?
"""Let's do it again,"" she says."
You want to do it again.
"One, two, three."
Good.
Look where you're standing.
All right?
- In and out.
- Okay.
Right?
Get used to missing.
"I want you to throw one, two, and then just keep it away from me, all right?"
"One, two."
Good.
That's it.
See?
"You're moving, you're moving, you're moving."
Keep me away from you.
Move that head.
Good.
And keep moving.
Right-hand hook.
Nice!
Again.
This is the birthplace of weird.
But why today?
This guy was a lottery nut.
Isn't tomorrow night the big jackpot?
Yeah.
"Yeah, he probably knew he'd never win, which makes him a whole lot smarter than me."
What have you got?
A contact lens case.
With only one lens.
Fluid!
It's fluid!
I need a wipe.
What?
I don't have a wipe.
Give...
Give me a wipe.
Just...
I need a wipe.
Where's Natalie?
I'm your biggest fan.
I never miss a show.
"Oh, thank you."
That means a lot.
"Natalie, what's your favorite number?"
My gosh.
There are so many.
Mine's 19.
That's a good one.
Do you think it's going to come up on the show tomorrow?
Excuse me.
"Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Monk."
I got a little distracted.
"Apart from you, we don't have anyone here."
I don't know. I have exams.
"All right, off you go."
I'll see what I'll do.
Thanks anyhow.
Good-bye.
Take care.
All right.
Hello.
Have a good day.
I've brought water from the spring.
Thank you. I've brought fresh bread.
Thank you very much.
Put it over there.
I'll put it here!
I'll get breakfast.
I'll go and wake my colleagues then.
"Yesterday, I asked your sister to bring us milk."
She probably forgot.
It was me.
"No, I spoke to your sister."
"No, it was me."
- lt was you?
- Yes.
She was pregnant.
I was pregnant.
It was you?
"Yes, in person."
Seriously!
"Yes, I've had the baby and I've come back here to work."
Where is it?
- ls that your baby?
- Two months?
Two weeks.
Two months?
Connor.
"Connor, come in."
I don't see him.
How long has it been?
Just a few minutes.
Did he forget how to pick a lock?
That's not a rhetorical question.
"Yeah, no, I agree."
That's a fair question.
Hang on.
You stay in the van.
You don't need to bring that.
You're not the boss.
"Hey, Blair, maybe I should come down there."
"No, we got this, all right."
"It just, something's not right."
"Stay put, stick with the plan."
"Blair, can you hear me?"
Blair?
"Blair, Blair."
Hello?
"Hello, hello, hello, hello."
"Blair, Blair, Blair, Blair, Blair, Blair."
Shit.
Just stick to the plan.
Just stick to the plan.
"Yeah, we'll stick to the plan."
We're good.
We'll just ah...
Where'd he go?
Where is that bastard?
"Hey, man!"
Get down here.
Do you see him?
Hey!
Where did he go?
Jong-go!
I gotta catch him.
Gotta catch that bastard.
Catch that bastard.
I can't believe this...
- Gotta save my baby.
- Come on.
Let's go down.
I gotta save my little girl.
- We'll get him.
"- I've gotta find him, and save my baby."
"- Don't worry, we will."
- Okay?
"Get your act together, man."
We gotta save her.
"I know, man."
I know.
I have to save my daughter...
"Come on, man."
I have to catch that bastard.
"Don't cry, man."
"Dammit, Jong-go!"
- (Wife)
"- Please, pick up."
Shit!
"I love you, too."
Where's Nick?
He's downstairs.
Apparel was half-off at the gift shop.
Oh.
"So glad you finally made it, bro."
"Thanks for being here, man."
"Yeah, man."
I got this scene under control.
She's at nine centimeters... and I'm at 16.
Why are you two holding hands?
They slept together.
You will do anything to steal focus.
"Okay, we're getting close now."
I'm gonna need you to push.
The breathing's not working.
I don't think I can do this.
Rub her back.
Get her some ice chips.
Rub her back with ice chips.
"Oh, I'm passing out."
What?
He's passing out.
Are you okay?
Gone.
Oh!
"Okay, yeah, get him out of here."
"In fact, everybody out."
But...
Yeah.
"Bye, everyone."
Come on.
"Yeah, I skated away and called you a big baby."
"Sophie threw a rock at me and you yelled, ""you're so gay."""
I did do that.
"Oh, didn't I?"
We used to use that word a lot.
You used to be able to call anything gay.
Ugh.
Do you ever miss that?
- No.
- No.
That's hurtful.
Yeah.
"I'm sorry, Mitchell."
"You were scared, and I should've held your hand through the tunnel, and I was..."
I was not a good big sister.
I'm so sorry.
Will you forgive me?
"- Yes, yes."
- You do?
- Yes!
I forgive you.
- I love you.
"- Love you, too."
- Love you!
"- Okay, okay."
- Okay.
- Let's do this.
"- Yes, let's do this."
- Come on.
- What?
What's happening?
"No, no, no, we're going..."
-Would you give me the friggin lighter.

"Collect that dough, and fast."
Come on.

Now get them up and turn around.
- Hey!
- Hey!
What's the matter?
"Next time you roll a guy for his poke, make sure he don't know your hideout."
How did you know?
"Come here, suckers."
- How do you know this place so good?
"- Yeah, how do you know?"
Let me show you.
Here.
Look at this.
"- ""R.S.""?"
"- Hey, you ain't Rocky Sullivan!"
Rocky Sullivan!
"Hey, did you get that?"
It's Rocky Sullivan!
We tried to hook you!
What a boner!
But no handcuffs this time.
You've gotten a lot harder since you've been away.
Lvan was all over me after you left tonight.
He kept asking me stuff.
Did I talk to you?
What did I say?
He's like something that crawls out of an old pipe.
It's okay.
"in a few days, this will all be behind us."
"Uh, I can't do It."
I'm not Mikhail.
He's dead.
Come here.
Shit!
"Look, I'm positive the girl went up to 323."
The room is empty.
I was just up there.
You saw her come in.
When did she leave?
I don't-
Do you recognize this man?
Yeah.
He checked in across the hall.
- Room 305.
- Room 305.
"Okay, good."
Let's go.
Found this.
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.
Where did he go?
Tell me!
Wait.
They check on your private communications?
They can do it.
They always find out anyway.
What if you called from outside.
from a public place.
Why would I do that?
- We could talk freely.
About what?
Take down my code.
Who knows.
You may need me.
I need no one.
- It's Denis.
Xavier.
Bernard. 612.
And my name is Thomas.
Thomas?
That's a nice name.
Eva is also a pretty name.
Maybe.
But it's not mine.
You're beautiful.
Why do you say that?
- Why what?
You can't say that.
It hurts me.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I find you beautiful.
That's all.
You just want to fuck me with your damn suit.
So my being pretty or ugly.
POLICE HEADQUARTERS
Blond hair ― that's all I can tell.
It was in the young woman's left fist.
But she herself had brown hair?
So add that to the poster:
"""Suspect has fine blond hair."""
Take this to the chief.
Room 62.
What's wrong?
What is it?
It's not my fault.
What's wrong?
"You mustn't get upset, Franz."
Don't start yelling right away.
What is it?
What is it?
It's not my fault!
"""Murder in Freienwalde."""
It's not my fault!
It's...
"It's Mieze, isn't it?"
Our little Mieze.
It's all over now.
Now they've done it.
Who was it?
Who was it?
I don't know.
"All I read was ""blond hair,"""
and blond hair has to mean Reinhold.
I don't know.
I don't want to accuse anyone.
It was Reinhold.
Drop the bat.
-Lance.
Sit the fuck down.
"-What the hell are you doing, lance?"
Put that gun down.
"-Are you okay, man."
Oh shit Hyder.
"-Is he okay, roger?"
"Well, I hope he's okay, bitch."
-Just put the gun down please.
This bitch hit Hyder.
-No I didn't know it was him.
Where the hell 'd'you get a gun?
Stop talking.
-Lance.
What are you doing?
"-She's gonna call the cops, man, we're all going to Juvie."
I'm not calling anybody.
-Sit the fuck down.
Jacob.
"-Lance, chill out."
"Shut the hell up, sit back."
Lance I got it chill out.
Okay.
What are you doing.
-I'm sorry.
"[Muffled] What are you doing, Jacob stop."
"Stop that, stop fighting him."
"Quit moving, quit moving."
"Quit moving, lay the fuck down."
"It's okay, it's okay."
What are you doing?
I think the heat's startin' to get to the boy!
"Well, I'll say!"
Look how red he is.
"I think he needs a new coat of poly, man."
"- Are you sick, buddy?"
- You are lookin' peaked.
He needs a new coat of poly for sure!
- Hey!
What are you doin'?
- It's OK.
"You can trust me, right?"
"I trust you, all right."
It's him I'm worried about.
Hmm...
I trust him.
"- Come on, let's take a drive."
- A drive?
"Yeah, a drive."
Don't you big city racecars ever just take a drive?
Ah...
No.
"No, we don't."
"Hey, Stickers!"
You comin' or what?
Mm-hm!
- And you thought he was gonna run.
"- Hey, can you believe it, man?"
He actually thought Doc was a famous racecar!
That's so too much!
"OK, you got me out here."
Where are we goin'?
I don't know.
I might be back of house.
"Wrong gift, then?"
Good luck.
Hena.
Thanks.
"I plan to forget everything that happened here, too."
Goodbye.
Later.
May I come in?
It's open.
I'm coming in.
"Hello, I'm Ilia, nice to meet..."
Don't turn the light on.
But...
Leave it off.
Okay.
I need to call the office first.
"Sir, would you like a one-hour or two-hour session?"
It's up to you.
"A two-hour session, then?"
Sure.
Great.
"I'm here, it'll be a two-hour session."
"Yes, got it."
Would you wear that eye mask?
I don't like being seen.
This?
Okay.
Will you give me the body shampoo?
Not easy washing you without seeing you.
Let me wash you.
"Is it you, Chong-su?"
We have to talk to him.
We have to tell him.
He's not gonna l...
Over here.
I think she's having a seizure.
He's alive.
"Hey, we need to get her to a hospital."
Derek... only to Derek.
When we get her to the hospital... to Derek.
To Derek.
Go.
I'm staying here with you.
He can't take her alone.
Not like this.
And Matt...
"I've got to call an ambulance for him, just go."
This doesn't feel right.
It's okay.
"No, it's not."
"No, it's not right."
It doesn't... it doesn't mean anything.
But it feels like it does.
"Scott, go."
Go.
Hello?
Over here.
Is this your house?
It was.
I'll tell you all about it.
But first... did you bring the flower?
I couldn't find it.
That's okay.
You seem like you do.
-Cut it out.
-What?
She wants to swim.
-She's afraid to get wet.
-I'm not afraid.
You little tart.
"You know what, you've had it."
-Shit!
God!
I can't believe you!
-See what I have to put up with?
"-It's not so bad, is it?"
-It's freezing.
"That's because your clothes are wet, silly."
-You really are a jackass.
God!
-No.
No name-calling now.
We're all adults here.
"-That's better, isn't it?"
"-Well, it's definitely warmer."
I'd much rather be in here than out there in that cold world.
"You're so polite, Alex."
It's okay to leave the ivory tower and live a little.
-Yes.
I can drive.
"-Well, you shouldn't."
You're drunk.
I'm not drunk.
I drank less than you.
"No, you did not."
"We finally got it to stop growing, but I can tell  it still hurts her."
And there's not a goddamn thing i can do about it.
That's my job: to protect her.
And I am completely powerless.
You make me feel safe.
What?
You make me feel safe.
I just thought you should know that.
-Can I see it?
- [SUSAN] Not yet.
"[SUSAN] All right, you ready?"
Close your eyes.
[LAUGHTER]
"[SUSAN] OK, you ready?"
"Turn, turn."
Stop.
"- [SUSAN] Ready, OK, open."
"- [LING] Oh, my room!"
My room!
I love it!
"Oh, my god."
Come here!
"Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!"
I'm calling Bender!
[EVAN] Hey.
"It's OK, it's OK."
She's happy.
You made her really happy.
Look at her.
Who would do that to someone?
I don't know.
I just don't understand.
Come to the front desk.
Yes or no?
We're here.
"Fine, we don't have to."
You're leaving?
Not like I'm desperate for girls.
Nice shot.
You suck.
Watch and learn.
"""Hello dear I have to work overnight"""
"""so please take Miki to day care tomorrow."""
Hey.
Feel how hard I am.
Your room's ready.
Go ahead.
Excuse me.
Here.
"Oh, thank you."
"Oh, and this too."
What's wrong?
The cleaning lady...
She looks familiar.
"She's not your neighbor, is she?"
"If she is, we're in trouble."
"Darn, where have I seen her?"
What if we're caught?
"Hey, hey..."
I don't care anymore.
"So you can't pay up, huh?"
Maybe call the police.
She doesn't even have an ID on her.
She can't pay.
What do you mean going off and leaving Regan by herself?
Are you crazy?
Her window's wide open!
-Didn't he tell you?
-Didn't who tell me?
What's Burke got to do with it?
Nobody was here.
"When I went to get the Thorazine I had him stay with her, and...."
-I should have known better.
-I guess you should have!
How were the tests?
We have to start looking for a shrink.
"Hi, Chuck."
Come on in.
I suppose you heard.
Heard what?
You haven't heard.
Burke is dead.
He must've been drunk.
He fell from the top of the steps outside.
"By the time he hit M Street, he broke his neck."
"Oh, God!"
"Yeah, I know."
Yes.
How old are you?
Twelve.
Is there someone inside you?
Sometimes.
Who is it?
I don't know.
Is it Captain Howdy?
I don't know.
[LAUGHS]
[SOBBING]
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean what I said.
"Oh, please, give me another chance."
I just couldn't stand it.
Couldn't...
I can't do any more time.
"Please, turn me out of here."
We'll do what we can for you.
Go along now.
Next man.
[¶¶¶]
I don't know.
I don't know anything about it.
Honest.
I didn't have anything to do with it.
That's the truth.
"You gotta believe me, fellas."
I'm waiting.
I don't know.
"Don't, Stacey, don't."
"All right, I'll tell!"
Spill it!
"It was Carlisle, Polecat Carlisle."
Hanley had him do it.
I didn't have no part in it.
I just fingered him.
I didn't know what they was gonna do with him.
You can't blame me.
Polecat.
Yeah.
"Me too, buddy."
Me too.
"Me too, buddy."
Me too.
It's just I promised the girls I'd be there.
It's just I promised the girls I'd be there.
"Barb, I told you."
It's not a problem.
Just go to the meeting.
It's fine.
"Barb, I told you."
It's not a problem.
Just go to the meeting.
It's fine.
I don't want to be late.
I don't want to be late.
Well...
"Yeah, he'll be OK."
Well...
"Yeah, he'll be OK."
(DINGS BELL)
(DINGS BELL)
He will.
(MOUTHS SILENTLY)
He will.
(MOUTHS SILENTLY)
"Look, I'll be home at 7:00 on the dot, and that is a solid promise."
"Look, I'll be home at 7:00 on the dot, and that is a solid promise."
Will you give Horrie his tablet?
"Yeah, leave it with me."
Will you give Horrie his tablet?
"Yeah, leave it with me."
Shut up.
Shut up!
- l--
"- No, I'm trying to explain it!"
Harold!
"- Shut up, shut up, shut up!"
Shut up!
Do we have the right to make a phone call?
Yeah.
Yeah!
I'm sorry.
You want rights now.
You want freedoms right now.
Is it time?
Is it freedom o'clock?
- Guess what.
- What?
"Where you guys are going, they have never even heard of rights."
"Well, where are we going?"
We're innocent men!
We're innocent men!
I'm an innocent man.
I donate blood.
And toys for tots.
And now I'm in Guantánamo Bay.
See why I'm against paying taxes?
Hey!
Hey.
Fuck you!
"Dude, calm down, OK?"
Look on the bright side.
There's a sink.
Get rid of it.
Not there!
"No, not there!"
Get rid of it!
"Here, get rid of it!"
Don't let her catch you with it!
"Drink it, drink it!"
Good boy.
"Oh, it's you."
Come in.
"Well, the sign says..."
"Oh, come on in."
What are you doing?
A little spying.
"Spying, on who?"
On Gretchen.
"You see, Bob can't figure out why he hasn't been called back to active duty."
Mr. Miles?
Yeah.
Bob?
Yeah.
He's in the Army?
"Well, sure."
He's in the reserves.
"Gee, now, if they called him back to active duty, then Nancy and me..."
What?
"Oh, I was just wondering to myself."
How come he wasn't called back?
"Well, read this."
It's from Gretchen to Colonel Blair's wife.
You shouldn't read other people's mail.
That's not very nice.
"- Come on, man!"
What I'm supposed Did the police or something?
So will you do?
There are other clients.
- When you want to see a line.
- It will not.
Fuck!
You can do it!
Let me go!
- Are you deaf or something?
- Let me go!
Fuck man!
"Now you're not very talkative, is not it?"
Sorry.
"I thought that part, ladies' room."
I hope bölmüyorumdur chat with.
"- Hey, relax a bit!"
- Watch!
Watch it!
Look!
The next thing that happened to you!
"If you come here again, where is your blood."
"Are you all right, baby?"
Are you okay?
Are you sure?
Come on.
"Come on, get up."
- I told you.
"- Now, gone, come on."
Just relax.
Here you go.
OK?
Mm-nn.
"You know her, but she doesn't know about you?"
Yeah.
I don't really understand it all but that's what the doctor tells me.
"Oh, no, Al, faking or not, he's crossing the line here."
I if I wanna talk to JMJ...
Give him time.
...I have to call her.
JMJ?
Can you hear me JMJ?
Hello?
This could be thrown back in our face.
He's all over her.
We could get a law suit for sexual harassment.
This is the box.
He knows what he's doing.
He can't be second-guessed.
"Hello, JMJ?"
"Hell, Al, he's outta control."
You wanna stop it?
It's your call.
You are a mean son of a bitch.
Mean son of a bitch?
Me?
"I didn't kill eight innocent women, Pamela, you did."
- No I didn't.
"- If you didn't, you know which one did."
Mary Maude?
JMJ?
"JMJ, JMJ?"
JMJ?
- Does JMJ scare you?
Nice working with you.
Shit you're so screwed man.
"And if next time you aren't any better, I'm going to get you for real."
See you next month.
Bye.
Hey no need to do that.
We're friends now.
Don't scratch.
It's perfect already.
Just check and send.
You'll miss your bedtime.
Huh?
Damn her nail is broken.
F*ck it's almost 9PM.
You take long showers so you need spare time.
Damn you also have to apply cream.
Stop being paranoid.
No one will notice it.
This tiny.
Enough.
Done.
Stop.
Save.
Send.
Sleep.
Just hit Command-s.
Save.
Sent it.
Hey did you finish this too quickly?
I'm that cool.
Yeah yeah.
Too late to fix.
I'll be gentle.
"Simon, you mustn't go."
I love you.
Keep your hands off Luise.
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.
No.
Sorry.
Get a taxi.
- But sugar!
- See you.
- You're not going?
- Yes.
Take care now.
- Do you mind?
- What are you doing with Hanne?
Nothing.
We were just having fun.
Why not just tell your dad and your friends the truth?
Don't be jealous.
You're the one I'm crazy for.
Why didn't you call?
I left thousands of messages.
I was at my father's.
I couldn't talk.
I missed you so badly.
Come here.
Wait here.
Who is she?
Michelle.
The daughter of a business associate.
You are going to marry her.
He gets what he wants.
And I guess he wanted me.
You know what?
I've really missed you over the years.
Me too.
You know you're the only person I was ever able to talk to.
After Jesse...
Why didn't you contact me when you came back ?
"You know, no bullshit, Pru."
Just the real reason.
I don't know...
I just thought...
The past was better left there.
It's Slade.
Just checking to see if you're OK.
Where are you ?
I'm just out.
- Out where ?
- I'm just out with a friend.
A friend ?
"Yes, Slade, a friend."
I do have them.
Put her on.
Sorry ?
Pru.
Put her on.
"Hi, Pru."
How is he doing ?
He didn't seem too good the other night.
"Yeah he's fine, considering."
- Did he speak much about Jesse ?
- Not really.
Here already.
"Come on, shawn."
Prior dives At the remote location.
Have come up empty.
"But if shawn can strike Pay dirt,"
He'll prove to his dad that He still has a nose for gold.
Here we go.
Come on.
Keep it up.
Come on.
Let me see it.
Let me see it.
Yeah!
"Ooh, here we go, boys."
Here we go.
Right there.
Right there.
"Ooh, right there."
"Gold here, boys."
There's gold here.
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah!
Killing it.
I'll mark that A new wake point.
It'll be wake point 5-1.
Marking now.
"So exciting, Treasure hunting."
I think I'm gonna Start heading out...
This is the coolest Thing ever!
It is beautiful.
"We're in the gold, buddy."
It is pouring up The hose right now.
No.
Look.
Here.
Feel.
- Feel.
- Where?
Here?
Just as I thought:
Cirrhosis pectoris.
What's that mean?
That means your eyes are twin pools of desire.
"Oh, doctor."
That's nice.
The things you do say.
"That doesn't hurt anymore, huh?"
"Oh, yes."
- Yes.
Yes.
- You'll be all right in the morning.
Wait!
Wait.
My ankle.
Don't you think you ought to look at that?
No.
"No, your ankle's all right."
But I'll tell you one thing.
You wear your garter too tight.
- That stops the circulation.
That's bad.
"- There, you see?"
You did find something.
"You are my doctor, aren't you?"
You keep it away!
It burns!
"Oh, it burns!"
Who are you?
No one.
Who are you?
"She's, she's all right."
"I don't want to talk about it, okay?"
"Okay, I'll talk to you."
"I'll call as soon as it's over, all right?"
"No, I just, I'm going through something and I just have to...."
"No, no...."
There's nothing.
"Hey, thanks a lot."
-Want a drink?
-Please.
What do you drink?
Scotch.
Ice and water.
No ice.
I'll get some from the kitchen.
That's all right.
I'll take it straight.
Please sit.
Where's her father?
In Europe.
-Have you told him what's happening?
-No.
"Well, I think you should."
I told Regan that was holy water.
I sprinkled it on her and she reacted very violently.
It's tap water.
What do you want me to do?
Finish it.
"Look, you give her an inch, she takes a mile."
I think we should stop.
"Oh, babe."
Come on.
Not now.
-I'm sorry.
-No.
You're right.
I....
I didn't....
Sorry.
Can I talk to you for a second?
-You should be with her if you want.
-I don't want to.
I wanna be with you.
-I want you to be with her.
-I can't be with her.
-Why not?
-She's Sam's girlfriend.
They're about to break up.
It's obvious.
-She's throwing herself at us.
"-She's throwing herself, I can't do it."
Jane....
"Look, I've done some weird shit in my life, and I'm glad I have because I have enjoyed 99 % of it, but I'm not screwing my son's girlfriend and I won't lay there and watch you do it."
"Oh, who's gonna know?"
I'll know.
-Hey.
What took you so long?
-Sorry.
- Do I know you?
"- No, I don't think so."
"I'm her daughter, Rebecca."
Right.
I thought you'd look more like your mom.
- I'm Sarah Walker.
- It's nice to meet you.
You too.
So...
Holly?
"Oh, um..."
- I have no idea where she is.
- OK.
Thanks.
Sorry.
Rebecca.
Um...
Do you have a minute?
Could I talk to you?
"Yeah, sure."
"Hey, Becca."
Where you been?
I stopped by Ojai today.
I wanted to check out your new digs.
- You did?
- Yeah.
I got the address from some papers you had lying around.
Thought I'd surprise you.
"Well, I'm sorry that I missed you."
I was out meeting with a distributor and I didn't want to drive all the way back to the office.
"So, um, would you like me to make lunch for both of us?"
No.
- Don't stop or I'll kill you.
- I gotta stop in the next station.
Touch the brakes and I'll blow you in half.
- What's goin' on?
- I don't know.
"Sit down, buddy."
Relax.
Coke!
"Coke, you all right?"
"Hey, Coke, you all right?"
Don't answer.
"Hey, Coke, you all right?"
- Get back.
- Relax.
Keep going.
You're not gonna get away with this.
Put the gun down.
Get back!
"- Come on, now."
- I said get back!
Stop!
Hold it!
Let's get outta here!
"Come on, come on."
Shake your ass.
Can't seem to find the damn ticket.
- Where's the guy?
- He's gettin' my car.
He's in the back.
Thank you.
"- Can I help you, sir?"
- Yeah.
I have problems with food in my house.
"Could you ask aunty to cook for me, too?"
How could I do that?
You don't have to cook!
Ask her to cook for me!
It's the same thing!
God!
She must have fallen!
I'll take a look!
Where to?
Aren't you ashamed to watch a woman bathing?
!
And where are you going?
"But I'm a girl, too."
Aunty's not a girl;
She's a woman!
Do something.
"You stand and watch, while she falls inside!"
I can't even watch...
the doors are shut.
Let me see...
Relax!
I'll ask her!
Aunty!
What has happened?
Nothing.
What fell inside?
It was my blouse.
A blouse?
Did a blouse make so much of noise?
!
Did a blouse make the noise?
What do you think I'd do?
Don't worry.
You sure this is it?
Yeah.
You got it straight?
"Hi, baby."
"Come on, Fantasia, let's go."
It'll be a few minutes.
I have to pack my stuff.
What stuff?
All you had was your purse.
It won't be long.
Come on in.
Shit!
I'll be back.
That's bullshit.
I'm sticking on your ass.
She better not have bought any clothes.
What does she have to pack?
-Come on.
-Be careful.
I love you.
Did you spend any of my money?
Fantasia?
Where did she go?
"Police officers, freeze!"
Hands up or I'll blow you to fucking hell!
-What the fuck?
-Get on the floor!
Now!
Who the fuck are you?
-You bitch!
He has a child.
"I know, but, come on, you've seen them together."
She's sort of lost her mind.
- This is her fault?
- It's nobody's fault.
It's just...
I don't know.
I think he just needs to talk to somebody.
- Okay.
- I'm not gonna be late.
- I'll be at my dad's till around 11:00.
- Okay.
"God, what's happening?"
Everyone around us is falling apart.
I know.
- Have fun.
- Thanks.
- Hi!
- I got this!
I don't need it!
"- Oh, my God!"
- My God!
"Oh, my God."
My top is totally clinging.
You can see everything.
"Don't worry, I promise I won't look."
Then I'll be insulted.
"- Well, I don't want to offend you."
"- Well, then."
Your top's wet.
Okay.
Where am I going?
Goodbye.
Do you get him?
Hello?
Who am I talking to?
"No, I don't understand you."
"Oh, it's you Henschke!"
What?
Franz?
"Yes, he was here!"
What did he look like?
Proper and hale!
He will return.
Good.
"Yes, thank you."
He's looking for Reinhold.
Let's follow him!
You stay here.
Stick 'em up!
Stick 'em up!
I only got one left.
What are you doing here?
Put that away!
What do you want from me?
I wanna bury the hatchet.
"I won't fall for that, silly."
"The arm is gone, otherwise I'm fine."
What else?
Nothing else.
- I wanna know what you want from me!
- I just wanna bury the hatchet.
You probably won't believe me.
"The arm is gone, it's not gonna grow again."
- I'll take three.
"- Mm, good boy."
Get some flesh on those bones.
How's everything in here?
All right?
"You off, then?"
Oh.
"Er... yes, if you're sure you're all right."
- He won't want for anything.
- It's Adam's decision.
Are you having a laugh?
"Look around, George."
I'm a pig in shit.
- Adam.
- Sorry.
Hm.
"- Right, I'll show you to the door."
"- No, no, that's OK, we can find it."
"Of course, yes."
Like tracker dogs.
- Um... excuse me?
!
"- No, come on."
"Cheers for bringing me here, though."
Look after him.
We don't need you to tell us that.
OK?
See you.
- Shall I feed the boy now?
"- Oh, not yet, Seven."
We're going to make a night of it.
"After all, Adam's finally where he belongs."
"Damn it, Reid."
"I said, ""Don't take the vest off."""
Come closer.
I want to see both of your hands at all times.
You sit across from me.
Why are you so nervous?
I told you.
I'm not used to being around guns.
This is going to probably sting a little bit.
Whoa.
Did you see that?
I knew it.
I knew it.
"Hey, look."
He's got it.
He's got it.
He's got the chip.
I've gotta go to the Higher Authority.
I was supposed...
Not yet!
Turn it on.
Turn the chip on.
Excuse me?
"- Get off the train, Reid."
"- No, no, something's wrong."
Get off the train.
- Get out of there.
- Why isn't he moving?
How many shots would it take to move in?
Two.
First blows the window.
Second takes Bryar down.
-No.
"I'll go alone, I'll go alone."
"-No, I'll go with you."
"-No, I'll go by myself."
I'll go.
"No, I also have to get something."
"The recipe, so I can cook for you."
I'll go with you?
.
"Fine, it's up to you."
And tomorrow's your birthday!
You're already 28 years old!
What would you like me to cook for you?
It's up to you.
-No!
"Just tell me, I'll cook it for you."
-Anything.
What?
Anything you want.
"Sorry, I can't come later."
Joy said she's coming with me.
Okay then.
I'll find a way.
I really need to see you.
Yes...okay.
I'll just call you.
Yes.
Who were you talking to?
You heard it right?
"I was talking to mommy, I just asked how she's doing."
-Are you sure?
.
- Eddie.
Search him!
"Eddie, what's with the security?"
It's not our first deal.
Maybe he looks familiar.
"Here's $200,000."
We'll check the guns first.
What are you guys doing?
"Nothing special, officer."
A reunion.
Open the trunk.
Open it!
Now!
Damn you!
"You set me up, didn't you?"
Are you a cop?
Talk!
I'm no cop!
I didn't betray you.
Then how come he's here?
He's no cop!
"I stake my life on it, Eddie!"
"Lying bastard, I shouldn't have trusted you!"
The guy's a cop.
I recognize him!
You've got it wrong.
"Chang, I'll get him!"
That shithead!
Don't move!
"Goddamn mess, assho--"
Finish your sentence.
Ass... assho--
Not with a tomboy like that.
Get on.
Hold tight.
"Yeah, I know."
What's up?
Dad?
Something wrong?
Well...
How do you tell someone...
It doesn't matter.
I'm home.
They're mad at you.
Why?
Said you'd stay-in this afternoon.
I didn't.
"Anyway, you were home."
I'm here on vacation...
I do what I want.
I might go jogging.
Cousins should help out.
I'll tell your Dad.
Noriko just hangs out doing nothing
You want to be like that?
Then I won't cover for you again.
"I'm joking, please be on my side!"
"100,000 kms from Earth"
"Okay, okay, what're you barking at?"
Let's go.
Quit it.
We're going.
A storm?
My ears are popping.
Will you two break it up?
Stop it!
Hold on to yourself.
What's the matter with you?
"Jimmy, you wasted two months on this."
No collars are comin' in... ..while you're runnin' around town jerkin' off!
Now go back to work!
You're off special assignment!
Get down!
Get out!
Get outta the area!
Leave her alone!
Stay away!
Leave her alone.
There's a sniper up there!
Hey!
Hey!
Stop that man!
He's wanted by the police!
- What's the next stop into the city?
- 25th Avenue.
Hold it!
Hold it!
Police emergency.
I need your car.
When am I gonna get it back?
For Christ's sake!
Hold it!
Stop!
Halt!
- Don't stop.
- But...
Where is it?
Where's what?
"Look, when I get through working you over, you'll tell me where it is."
Or do you want to talk now?
"All right, I'll talk."
"Well, talk!"
How's Mama?
(GRUNTING)
This way.
I don't know what you're mad at me for!
"I didn't do anything to you, and I didn't do anything to your wife!"
No one ever double-crossed me.
No one living.
What do you want from me?
I know you have that diamond.
I put it in your pocket myself.
There's nothing in my...
Is this what you want?
"All right, here."
I don't want it.
Are we friends now?
BOB:
Wilbur!
Huh?
"Stop him, he's a crook!"
Hey!
"Hey, man!"
Man!
Man!
"Man, wait!"
"Mister, will you wait?"
They want...
"I mean, that's what they deal ya."
That's what they tell ya.
Yep.
Well...
"Sorry to take your time, Jack."
You have a good day.
We're almost there.
Wait.
Oh shit.
"No, forget it."
"Let's go, let's go!"
Come on.
"Look, baby, we're so close."
You can do this.
Let's go.
I can't.
"Vivian, how long have you been down here?"
Weeks.
"Once, I don't know."
This is your chance to get out.
We have to go.
I cant.
Fuck it.
Leave her.
You can't leave her.
Beautiful land you got out here.
Thank you kindly.
I guess it was just kids playing around with the phone.
Take care.
"Sorry you had to drive all this way, Sheriff."
Don't go!
"Wait, wait!"
"Granddad, what are you doing?"
!
Stop the car!
I don't want to die!
There!
Now stick that up your ass!
My car!
You hit my car!
Your fault for parking like a fucking asshole!
"Granddad, wait!"
Let's get out.
Oh!
Man!
We can't get out!
"Yes, I said it!"
"Hey, little girl."
Your daddy parked like a fucking asshole.
"Now, won't you be my neighbor motherfucker."
He's trying to start a nigga moment!
I'm from a town called Whup Mr...
Aah!
Run!
We're sorry!
We'll pay for the damage!
Just run!
We will not!
"You little niggas, get off of me!"
"Come on, honey, let's walk the other way and call the police."
- Stay down!
"Stay down, please!"
- Get off me!
Please stay down!
Tell me...
Where were you on Sept 3?
Sept 3?
I've been touring in China for the Asian Fight.
I just got back.
It was live on TV.
Sorry.
We made a mistake.
Sorry.
Jesus.
"Chairman, Don't be afraid?"
There's 10 of us.
He only has 7 bullets.
"Yes, chairman."
Don't be afraid!
Big mouth.
It's 15 bullets.
Get it?
Want one in you?
What about you?
No loyalty.
And you?
That was close...
You didn't do much to save me last night.
"But I almost died for you today, we're even."
"Bro, yours is a fake gun."
"We're friends, forget it."
Where are you sneaking off?
"You said you're sleepy, right?"
"You go back first, I'll dine with Lisa."
"You didn't sleep too, right?"
How embarrassing to fall asleep on the dinning table.
"He's in his crib, like you said."
"Well, you can't... you can't just walk out and leave him alone."
He's not alone.
He has you.
"Look, this isn't just about us."
We have a child.
You were hurt.
"And everyone thinks that maybe you need time, but Lucas doesn't care."
He needs you now.
"But... and if I'm gonna be a good father,"
I've gotta do what's best for him.
I can't fix you.
I can't... make you walk out the front door.
You have to do it yourself.
And I have to let you.
Ow!
Ow!
It's okay...
leave me alone!
Aah!
"Tammy, stop it!"
Ah!
Don't!
Leave me alone.

I don't know.
It came out of nowhere.

What's up?
Sup?
Didn't you call me?
Never mind.
Never mind?
Just tell me why you called?
Nothing.
"The Girls Group's cover, I noticed a nail was broken."
But I already got Jerd to fix it.
So it's ok.
Hey!
You sent my work to Jerd.
That really sucks.
C'mon it was just a little job.
Come on.
This is true.
"This is true, Roldy."
Ooh wee
"- Man, this is so not like me."
- Yeah.
It's like I'm a whole new Harold.
"Better, faster, stronger."
Nice.
"Man, I've never used a sick day before."
"I'm taking a whole week off from work here, man."
"And in less than eight hours, we're gonna be in Amsterdam."
- This is nuts.
This is nuts.

"It's gonna be exactly like Euro Trip, only it's not gonna suck."
- It's gonna be awesome.
- It's not not gonna be awesome.
Dude.
"Dude, this chick's giving me such a boner, it's awesome."
Thank you.
You ruined the moment.
"She's all yours, buddy."
- You wanna pause it?

"No, that's--"
Enjoy.
Just a minute.
Fuc--
"Hey, hey."
Let me in.

You've already talked about.
Why not say again?
Slab.
I did not say you were bad.
I did not say that you are weak.
-Do you love me?
It's not about that.
"No, not about that!"
"No, it's not about that!"
-It's About it!
-Not!
-You did not answer me!
"Yes, I love you."
-When You love someone...
Amends.
Do not turn your back.
You have to be careful with that.
It may never get.
"I can not do this to work with you, Edward."
I can not keep doing this.
Susan.
You can not turn your back on problems all the time.
Come on.
Come on.
-Shit.

Don't panic.
There's only 1 bullet left.
"Block it with your finger, hurry up!"
How do you know you'll be alright if I fire?

Don't worry!
Some jerk tried it once.
Then go ahead!

It's for the better.
"I'm tied down for a week, so I'll just stay put here and write."
"Mr. Director, you are wonderful."
Does it hurt?
A little.
"Damn it, this sucks."
Hello.
- Did you like the food yesterday?
"- Yes, it was delicious."
I'd like to order the soup again.
"Sure, but how's the movie director?"
He's still in pain.
- Hope he recovers soon.
- So do I.
- It'll be ready in a moment.
- Okay.
What's this?
"Oh, that?"
It's a cane.
Why?
Do you need it?
Is anyone using it?
We don't use it anymore.
My husband used it way back.
"If you need it, take it."
"Oh, thank you."
You're welcome.
- Hello.
- Hello.
"- Want some fried eggs, too?"
- Yes.
How many?
Come on.
"Should I help him along, Dad?"
"You know your dad, God bless his Irish soul..."
He was...
How shall I put it?
He was sort of killed.
Tell Tommy who killed his dad.

- I'm your son.
Let me go.
Let me go.
- Freeze!
Stop or I'll shoot!
"- Vince, no!"
"I'm sorry, Tommy."
I never meant for any of this to happen.
He was my son.
"But it's over now, because we're going in... together."
What are you gonna do?
Shoot me?
"Come on, shoot me."
You couldn't do it before.
You just don't have it in you.
Shoot your own son?
There goes that gold watch.
"I'll give her a fight, all right!"
"- No, no, no."
Wanted to write!
- What?
Wanted to write.
On the paper.
Why should I want to write on it?
I'll have some sent up to your room immediately.
Manuel!
That doesn't work either.
What were you saying just now?
- Turn it on.
- What?
Turn it...
Turn... it... on.
I can't read that.
I need my glasses.
Where are they?
"They're on your head, Mrs. Richards."
I've lost them.
They're the only pair I've got.
I can't read a thing without them.
Excuse me!
"- Now, I had them this morning..."
- Mrs. Richards...
When I was buying the vase...
"I put them on to look at it, and then I had them at tea time..."
Mrs. Richards!
Your glasses are there!

There's no version of this that feels right.
I'm looking for Sean or Beverly Lincoln?
Yes?

You like it?
They told me nobody's fucked on it yet.

You are all but useless.
You always know what to do.

I promise I'll be all right.
I will do everything to be in order.
"God, no."
Edward.

So?
Women today fast for the long lives of their husbands.
You should know all this.
I do.
But how am I concerned?
Oh God!
I thought you'd fast and pray...
I've called so many other women over.
Okay.
I'll ask them to return.
No.
Let them be since they're here.
But ask me before you do it next time.
Tea?

Just a minute.

You can't be stubborn with me.
Now quietly come downstairs.
I'm ready.
How do I look?
You always look good.
Why are you crying?
Mom doesn't listen to me!
"Yeah, it's okay."
Look.
It's written in my notebook.
Right here.
See that?
"""It looks like her number came up."""
Let's see your notebook.
I didn't write it down.
I just thought of it.
Please.
Come on.
Can you believe this guy?
You know what?
"I'm going to have your badge, Officer..."
"Come on, Shifty."
Let's walk it off.
Excuse me.
I'm Stan Lawrence.
I'm the station manager.
Here's that list you wanted.
Oh.
"Great, great, great."
I'll make sure they get it.
How long did she work here?
Not long.
Just a few weeks.
I still can't believe it.
I...
I should have put more lights back here.
"Oh, no, no, no, no."
You can't blame yourself.
It was at midnight.
–Drop your weapon!
–I killed them all!
"J.F.K, R.F.K, M.L.K."
"–Carlson, got bean bags?"
–Locked and loaded.
Run DMC.!
That's the guy?
He's a nut.
–I was told he had a bloody machete.
–I called in a kitchen knife.
"–Oh, for Christ's sakes."
–I was told to call if I found anything.
End this!
Come on.
"–Oh, my God!"
"–Just a bean bag, ma'am."
–Let's get back to Bob and Marcy.
–I released them.
–You what?
–I thought we had the guy here.
Bob didn't do it.
Marcy would've told me.
"Stay still for me, sir."
That's it.
–I'm his boss.
How is he?
"–He's gonna live, but we need him in surgery."
–Not until I see my kids.
"–Vic, don't be stupid."
They're on their way here.
They're gonna be here any second.
–Vic.
"Yes, now I can talk."
"No, I can not now."
It was an agreement.
Me neither.
Maybe tomorrow.
"They will not be here, I will give a getaway."
"Yes, we talk tomorrow."
Who was it?
'It was not anyone.
Why do you want to give a getaway?
-Henning And I are going to see in the woods.
So I want to go out at night.
Henning does not like to go there alone.
I think you're lying.
You can tell it was her mother.

And your brains.
Oops!
I noticed that.
She's a smart little thing-- smart.
Hey!
"Hey, where you going?"
She'll be all right.
Have a date.
Come on.
Come on.
Okay...
Marion.
What's this?
It's a date.
You eat 'em.
"How come you haven't found some nice girl to settle down with, raise eight or nine kids, like your friend Sallah?"
Who says I haven't?
I do.
Dad had you figured a long time ago.
He said you were a bum.
"Oh, he's being generous."
The most gifted bum he ever trained.
"You know, he loved you like a son."
Took a hell of a lot for you to alienate him.
"Not much, just you."
"Marion, get out of here!"
Duck!
Right.
Shh!
Shh!
Marion!
I didn't think you were going to...
feel that way.
I thought sometime you might want to come over and meet my sons.
Can we do that right now?
"Now as in ""now""?"
Yeah.
"Oh, good."
You're here.
You have to clean all this up.
Come on.
Come on.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Put away all this stuff.
All this stuff needs to be put away somewhere.
No.
Wait.
You're right.
This is better.
More kid-like.
Just play.
Do whatever you normally do.
Just be kids.
That's great.
Is that gonna fit in there?
"No, I don't think so."
Maybe you can put it in there.
I guess not.
"It looked like it would fit, but I guess not."
Wait.
Wait.
"- Yes, sir."
Mr. Weng!
What do you want?
"You should payJeffrey, or he might come afteryou."
That's bullshit!
I'm safe.
Look at these guys.
They're killers.
You're the boss.
You should keep your word.
Don't talk crap.
"I won't pay him, even ifyou beg."
"Mr. Weng, let me keep my word and pay him what I promised."
Then I'll bring him to you.
"Mr. Weng, if it pleases you..."
I will beg.
Go to hell!
Ifyou hadn't worked for my father for so long...
I'd have kicked the shit out ofyou!
Who is he?
He doesn't deserve your sympathy!
Why are you doing all this forJeffrey?
He's my best friend.
Cut the crap!
Come here now!
Mr. Weng's been shot.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Don't let him go!
"- Mr. Weng, you've been hurt!"
-Just kill him!
- Let's go!
They are looking for the female angle again.

Girls Like Us?

It will be.

You can have my spot.
Richard White.
That's me.
Go.
Thank you.
Honey.
"Oh, great."
"We're out of candles, and now the ice cream is melted."
"Honey, please."
Stop worrying.
Stop worrying ?
We're about to be washed out to sea.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
I'm...
I'm right ?
I thought I was exaggerating.
I'm going up there.
To do what ?
To go swim out to shore ?
I don't know.
Assess the situation...
figure it out.
I'm your mother.
It's my job.
Wait.
You can't do that.
Why not ?
I'll meet you there.
Hey.
Hi.
"Hey, Marissa come back?"
Uh uh.
You smell like smoke.
"Yeah, we, uh...hot boxed Nordlin's car."
And didn't invite me?
"Dude, that kid was messed up."
He was breathing.
"Yeah, I hope so."
I can't believe this.
This house is cursed.
You the owner?
"Yes, I am."
What happened?
Not sure yet.
But it looks like someone's been living here.
What?
It's my fault.
You're okay.
Disappointed?
Where are you going?
Don't know.
We both keep our mouths shut.
They may never know it was us.
What are you doing?
You're giving me a ride.
I don't know what happened.
I do not know why the house burned down.
What was he even doing there?
Why didn't you tell us?
Let's go.
Call or fold.
Make a decision.
- Can we try to finish?
- I'm 40 light.
You mind?
- What?
"- No, there's no going light in my game, pal."
Come on.
It's more for you if you win.
Doesn't cost you if you lose.
- Go ahead.
"- Aw, man."
- Write that down.
"- What am I, your secretary?"
Yes.
Beat his ass.
- Three nines?
"- Yeah, three nines."
Told ya.
Good.
Good.
You deserve it.
"Hey, I was a fan."
Give me at least half.
Why don't you run over to that A.T.M.
"Yeah, right."
You can finally pay me back.
"Oh, damn."
You know what?
I must have forgotten my debit card.
"Oh, what a shock."
Not after what I went through.
Sleeping curse.
"The one time I did sleep, I had horrible nightmares."
It's a side effect.
Same thing happened to me.
It did?
Mm.
I had them for months.
"Charming, my husband, he used to wake me when I cried out."
He'd light a candle.
He said it would capture the nightmares.
He'd watch over me as I fell back to sleep.
Sounds like he lives up to his name.
Yeah.
Um...
Why don't you try to sleep?
I'll watch over you.
You'll be safe.
Thank you.
(GRUNTING)
(PANTING)
(GRUNTS)
What happened here?
It's where the final battle was.
Give me your hand.
What?
Your hand.
It's cut.
Let me help.
"No, no."
It's fine.
Just...
"- Thanks, madam."
Beto...
Tomorrow I'll come to talk to you.
"- All right, madam."
Merry Christmas.
The new owners will move in next week.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
"I want to help you, but I don't know how."
I don't want to leave.
You could remarry.
"I can't live with anybody, I am a weird man."
So many years have passed.
"- Yes, madam, 30."
"Can you please leave me alone, Beto?"
"Yes, madam."
"Hello, Too."
"Fine, and you?"
I am calling to ask you for a favour.
Can you get a job for Beto?
"Yes, we all feel the same."
"Yes, I'll do that."
Of course.
I send you a kiss.
Bye.
One moment.
We'd better go.
Hello?
"Hey, Lupe!"
Why?
Right.
Can't someone else go?
"- Aw, I do like you."
My name is Murray Cornish.
I remember that.
- Do you?
- You're very charming.
- You think I'm going to -
- I think you're a charming man.
"- Da, da, da, da, da."
- [Laughs]
"Yes, I like you."
I like you too.
"You know, you're not making me too fishy."
I'm
- I'm with everything -
I don't let it go down.
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.
Are you going to live with us?
- Here?
- Yeah.
"Well, maybe someday I might."
- Not yet.
- Not yet.
It's not my time yet.
[Vocalizing]
"You could come in with me... with I, uh -with all our guys."
They'd like you.
But I would like you.
[Chuckling]
Murray's on the way.
You get it?
I got it.
"It won't be so bad, believe me."
Good night.
The fish will be pleased.
That's the third in a week.
They'll get the texts down there.
Where can I phone from?
Do you have a mobile?
"Well, me and mobiles..."
There's a phone kiosk over there.
"It's my office, but you can use it."
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
"Sophie, it's Mum."
No.
I'm still at the office.
"Yes, I know it's late."
Tomorrow lunchtime?
OK.
I'll collect him.
You can count on me.
Yes...
"Lots of love, darling."
You too...
Wait.
Wait.
It's...
It's unpredictable.
I'll...
It blocks sometimes.
- There.
- Thank you.
- Sure you're all right?
"Really, really fun."
- What are you do...?
- We're just getting into it.
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
"No, this has been a good hang, but I think it's time to bye-bye."
"- Oh, that's... that's it?"
- Yeah.
Where do your serving spoons go?
Second drawer to the left.
"Thank you, Doctor."
I really love bonding with you.
Next time let's not dwell on Matt.
"You know, he's gone."
Who the hell have you been talking t...?
- Hey.
- Hey.
"Uh, hanging out with my sisters?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, thought I'd give it a try."
Was worried it might be weird.
Turns out I'm right.
How are you... how are you doing?
Fine.
You?
Fine.
Also.
Great.
Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
(sighs)
"I came in here to yell at you, and, uh, now I'm just sad."
"Fish, fish... go on, stop that, will you?"
Lay off of that stuff.
"I don't give that fish stuff a nod, no matter how many you've caught."
- I'm sorry.
- What are you sorry about?
Always feeling sorry.
"Don't do that, kid, will you?"
Waste of time.
Come on.
I'm sor...
"I mean, ok."
Attaboy.
"You'll smarten up with me, all right."
Yes?
Washington?
"Ok, put them on."
"Yes, yes, speaking."
What?
"Yes, where?"
But what about my...
Oh.
Yes.
I'll be here all the time.
What?
"Nothing about Paul yet, darling."
They caught up with the Krozac gang and shot it out with them.
They're all dead.
But they didn't have Paul.
But what about him?
"He wasn't with them, either."
Then he has him.
He has my little boy!
"Apparently, not everybody's favorite."
And the final number is 17.
My daughter's age!
"Hi, Julie!"
"Once again, the Gold Rush numbers are 25, 52, 7, 32, 10, and 17."
"So, that's it for now."
Keep playing lotto!
You'll thank me later.
"""You'll thank me later""?"
That's my line.
I say that.
"Hurts, doesn't it?"
"You know, I might as well flush 20 bucks down the toilet once a week."
It was terrible.
Wasn't I terrible?
Yeah.
You were great.
I don't know what happened.
I just...
I got so nervous.
You were great.
It's like a tax on the stupid.
"Come on, Randy."
We're parked out front.
Great job.
"Thank you, Mr. Monk."
It was fun.
Yeah.
I'm glad you did it.
What a fun thing to do only one time and never try it again or mention it again.
Natalie?
Where are you going?
"How are you, Captain?"
Am I intruding?
"Sure, it's after midnight."
Where are you?
In a hotel.
I'm out till tomorrow night.
On a leave.
Wasn't a jailbreak.
I gotta see you fast.
"Tonight, I can't."
You'll regret it.
"Meet me in 1 hr at ""Swann's""."
Same again?
"No, thanks."
Camille OK?
She's fine.
When did you buy this?
We'll talk cars later.
What's up?
Nice welcome!
You haven't seen me in 4 years.
Don't I rate a smile?
This is a favor for a pal inside.
You made me cross Paris for a lousy scam?
I got a hot tip.
You're a piece of shit.
What is it?
Heavy duty stuff.
Real hot tip.
Want it or not?
What's the deal?
Just stay with me.
"No, I'm good."
"I fixed up the guest room for you, but I thought maybe we'd go out to lunch first."
"I kinda just wanna crash, if that's cool."
Sure.
Sure.
It's cool.
Very cool.
Do you want me to show you where the room is?
- I'll find it.
- Yeah.
You can find it.
You're good like that.
He can find it.
I hope it's your daughter... who's gonna decide which home to put you in.
"Well, this is fun."
The two of us.
Getting a chance to talk and catch up... and shoot the breeze.
So how's school?
- Good.
- Oh.
Yeah?
"Well, you certainly have a lot to say..."
To someone.
- What?
- Nothing.
You know.
I text.
So I get it.
"Sorry, what did you say, mom?"
"You know, lol."
Omg.
Om-- you know what--g.
See you later.
Don't forget the meeting!
Try to be there!
What do you say?
The work is hard.
You have to get used to it.
I don't think it's that hard.
It's just getting used to it.
Try to make it to the meeting.
I'm very tired.
I'm asking you... as the organizer.
I'll see.
I'm counting on you.
"Founé, my thurible!"
"Founé, hand me the phone."
Good morning.
"Yes, it's me."
Is the boss in?
Let me speak to him.
"Hold on, I'll go and see."
Founé!
Put Sissoko on the phone.
Who is it?
Zangué?
What's the matter?
Are the workers meeting... with your permission?
Never!
This is Balla's idea.
Incredible!
I can't trust anybody.
Don't wait for me.
"Take Kariba or Drissa with you, and follow procedure."
"He'll probably be furious, but we're used to that."
Who's we?
"Oh, me and Pauline."
It's my boss.
That's who I've been sort of seeing.
You met him that day.
Oh.
I thought he was married.
"Well, yes."
That's been the complication.
The boss I met?
Mr Stanley?
Yes.
But he is married.
I heard him saying something about his wife.
They don't get on.
They're all very showjump-y.
Who are?
The wife and the daughters.
He's got daughters?
Yes.
Two.
They do dressage.
But you haven't had an affair with him?
"Well, yes."
What did you think you were doing?
To them?
What I was doing?
To their family.
You had no right.
He was somebody's husband and he was somebody's father.
"That's wrong, Enid."
I'll be in front of the store at 7. I'll wait for you!
I wasn't going to go back to the department store.
Yes!
Oi!
What are you doing!
?
She's dead!
That's him.
That must be him.
It's revenge because she told everyone about him peeping into her room.
Who?
Who the hell is he!
?
He's not here.
He must've run away.
Where the hell is he!
?
Please don't be silly.
What do you think you're doing with that gun?
Get your hands off!
Stop it!
Stop it!
There he is.
That's him.
That's the guy!
Tomorrow night at seven.
Just one more time.
I'm used to being disappointed.
Tomorrow night at seven...
I want to see her.
I want to meet her.
I heard that you'd finished.
'Course it does.
You bugger.
Mam!
Wait!
What did he say?
Who?
Him.
Nothing.
He said he'd given me a ball or something.
A ball?
He didn't say to come with him or anything?
To Canada?
No.
No.
"Because you're staying with me, aren't you?"
"Mam, can we play the record?"
No.
I told you.
But why?
Because I don't want to hear it!
Now fasten it up.
"You don't get it out, you don't show it anybody, and you don't tell anybody."
I mean it.
"She said, ""Pop in."""
She wants me to pop in.
"I'm not making this up, am I?"
"She wants me, Tubby Baker, to come and see her in her office."
"Got to mean something, hasn't it?"
Ooh.
"One, two."
And...
"# In this grove, in this grove"
"I-I'm just finally getting lucky, I guess."
Just lucky.
You guess.
Listen!
"There's no fix, okay?"
Is it an owner?
Huh?
No!
I swear!
"Fuck, it was just a streak, okay?"
"Look, okay, okay!"
I have a source!
I have a source.
It's reliable.
I can't explain it.
It could cause some serious problems.
Was it a doctor?
Tell me what they're doing to bring in the fix!
"No, it- it's nothing like that."
"Look, you wouldn't believe me if I told you."
Bullshit.
(GRUNTING)
Can't you just ride my bets?
Yeah.
"Just make the same bets I do and-I know what ""ride"" means."
(DOOR UNLOCKS)
You are such a piece of shit.
"I hope you enjoyed the peep show, Jasper!"
I'll... take that.
"- Finn, this is-"
- IVAN:
I was just leaving.
Yeah.
"Cigar, pal?"
"Oh, thanks, pal."
(COUGHING)
It's a cigar!
It's a real cigar!
"What did you think it was, Wilbur?"
W-What did I think it was?
"Oh, I..."
I thought it was a candy cigar.
My daddy always gave me candy cigars.
Candy cigar?
Yeah.
Did it taste anything like this?
Did it taste...
I'll see.
I'll wait.
I...
I'm not sure.
"Let's try again, Wilbur."
I don't think it's the same.
We must be positive.
Pal.
I feel awful.
I got some medicine that'll fix you right up.
How do like your Scotch?
Plain or with soda?
On the rocks.
On the rocks?
"Oh, on the rocks is what my daddy always says when he orders that nasty whiskey."
I can't make up my mind about you.
Let me feel your muscle.
Come here.
I wish you wanted to go out.
I am out.
I don't live here.
"Oh, I adopted a cat."
I know.
You send me pictures.
I send them or I sent them once?
"- Oh, more than once."
- I think I'm going to name my cat Gadzookey.
You have a little situation there.
With your...
Oh.
I love him.
You should love a human.
I just don't want him to be one of those exes I have to see every few years.
You know?
He's making it really easy.
I hate that you think this is easy.
That's nice.
- Should I do anything?
"- No, no, no, just look that way."
There you go.
Smile.
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)
Think of something funny.
Nice.
There you go.
It's me.
Work it.
Work it.
"Classic, but not a comedy."
"- Yes sir, right away!"
"Back so soon, you're not dumb this time!"
What?
What happened?
Take it out!
What are you doing?
Fat Pat?
- Take him to toilet and get the 'Beast'!
- Yes Sir!
"Don't do that, I'm against violence!"
I'm against violence...!
"Boss, I can't find it!"
I don't believe!
Did he hide it there?
Not here...!
To hell with you...!
Fat Pig!
"- Boss, he calls you Fat Pig!"
- You want us to beat him up?
No need!
"I'll help him to this drink, and he'll curse no more."
There's no poison!
I don't want to take...
"Here you are, $1.00 please!"
What the hell do you want?
Want some water?
Alright?
Feeling better?
It's poison!
Damn it!
Couldn't find the American and the Jew's dead.
"And my half a million dollars too, oh hell!"
I got an MW today.
A Major Warning.
Because I called you at home?
- No.
Something else.
I'm sorry.
I'm used to it.
Besides.
I don't care.
I don't want to cause you trouble.
- Don't worry.
Promise me you'll call in case of a problem.
What would you do?
Rescue me by visiophone?
Yes.
I'd rescue you.
I love you.
That's ridiculous.
It's sincere.
- Not true.
I know what I'm feeling or not.
If you were in love.
If you loved me.
you'd go outside.
I can't.
Too bad then.
Wait.
Wait.
Listen...
It may be conceivable.
I may conceive that you come to my place.
That you come into my apartment.
I-I...
Did.
"You only dated him, what... twice?"
"Right, twice."
"So, on 50% of your dates, you slept with rob."
Or you... you could say
I only slept with him on half our dates.
Wow.
What?
Nothing.
I just...
I never thought of you as...
What?
Easy.
Easy?
"Well, you wouldn't sleep with me until our fifth date."
You were married.
So are we!
"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
Do not go there.
You categorically told me we were over.
Right.
"In fact, the night that rob and I..."
N-n-n-n...
I actually called and asked if you wanted me to cancel my date.
And what did you say?
"""Go."
"Go."""
"I meant ""go on a date,"" not ""go fuck him""!"
Oh...
God!
Why did you have to tell me?
"Left, right, face."
Forward.
Your brother was a good man.
"Yes, he was."
She won't get out of the car.
Oh...
Hey.
"Welcome home, Maggie."
"You know, I think it'll make you feel better to be with everyone."
We all miss him.
That led was not your fault.
And it's also not your fault that you survived and he didn't.
Get out of the car.
- Get out of the car.
Get out of the car.
- No.
No.
No.
"When we got back from Nam, we had a hard time too, but we got over it."
Out.
"- Take her home, Percy."
"- Come on, baby."
"It's okay, baby."
It's all right.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
"Why don't you, uh...?"
Why don't you lose that shirt?
Come on.
- Unh.
- Drop that belt.
Take your clothes off.
(Rachel) You don't have to do this.
Call for backup.
They'll kill you.
John?
I'm Armant.
Where's the little girl?
"Well, how do I know you've actually got what I want?"
Thank you.
Okay.
Let the little girl go and I'll take you to it.
I'm scared.
"Listen, listen."
"I want you to go with Rachel, okay?"
"Yes, go with Rachel."
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Lord grant me the wisdom and the strength to do what must be done.
[bell tolling]
You gotta be shitting me.
It's inside there?
This little girl was right all along?
"Well, c'mon."
Let's go to church.
"Good afternoon, Father."
You look a little lost.
May I help you?
"I once was lost, but now I'm found."
[low beeping]
"Ah, what a beautiful sound."
[fast beeping]
Stop.
Fresco.
"Hold up, hold up."
I do something wrong?
Nah.
I'm saying I want the whole thing tonight.
Oh.
Wow.
You cool with that?
Yeah.
Yeah?
"I don't want to see shit, a'ight?"
You won't see nothing.
Okay.
Damn.
(Gasping)
Damn.
Can I ask you something?
What's up?
"Well, you know when we met,"
How you said you were gonna take me out?
Yeah.
"Well, how come you don't take me out?"
How come you only ask me to come to your room?
"What, you don't like coming over here?"
"No, of course I do."
"I'm just saying, like..."
How come we don't we go out?
"You know like, to the movies, or to eat?"
Cause that shit is whack.
I don't think its whack.
Whatever.
Doesn't matter.
I still know she doesn't hate you.
How?
I'm a daughter too.
Vi?
She left.
Where did she go?
To get more bullets.
"Listen carefully, Daisy."
"When she comes back,"
I need for you to be the one to put me down.
It's very important.
Why me?
"Cause you and me are friends, right?"
"- I guess, but..."
- Will you promise me that?
- I can't.
- I need you to promise me.
- But I can't.
- I need you to do this for me.
- I can't.
- I need you to do this for me!
"- No, I can't!"
"- Don't argue with me, April!"
- But I'm Daisy.
- Just don't argue with me girl!
You promise me.
Say it.
- I promise.
- You promise?
"I said I would, didn't I?"
I have something to show you.
"It's all right, mother."
I'm home now.
"Oh, yes, yes, I know, darling."
"No, I'm all right."
"Oh, my dear!"
"Hi, dads."
I'm here.
"Oh, son!"
That's a boy.
You all right?
"- Yeah, but I have to sleep."
Leave him alone.
"Oh, it's all right, Joe."
"You see Joe, Joe Krozac is his name-"
He brought me home.
"Didn't you, Joe?"
There you are.
"You got quite a ducking, didn't you, son?"
"Here, I'll do that."
"The last time it rained, we slept in a haystack."
"You should have been with us, dads."
It was fun.
I'll bet it was.
"You know, Joe tried to make a fire, and I showed him how."
The way you showed me.
"Didn't I, Joe?"
Let's get this coat off.
"You two must have had some experience, huh?"
Yes.
"Here are your pajamas, darling."
The ones you like...
How about a big glass of hot milk?
You two could be perfect strangers.
"I think the one thing that we can agree on, today, is that you guys should be doing a lot better than just ""works."""
Pretty sure that's why you're here.
Oh.
That's it.
Great.
"Great job, everybody."
Thank you.
Lucy?
"Good day, sir."
I got room service for you.
I'm very sorry.
I didn't order that.
"I think your wife, she called me for you."
I'm...
This is just...
"Because I got a sunburn, 'cause it was..."
The sun was very strong today.
Yeah.
I know.
"This is good for sunburns, right?"
No.
Okay.
"It's good, yeah?"
It's good for sunburn?
"Okay, so I don't see anything."
See what?
There's nothing to see.
"Yeah, yeah, no, no, no."
It works great.
"Okay, I move now."
No.
You come.
We make you strong.
Cool... you want some?
!
They're really good!
They're my favorite!
- They're really really good!
- no thanks
What do you like...?
You can have anything you want...!
That's ok..
Okay...!
I guess that's it...!
I guess I could have one really!
"here, try this"
...Sorry
Owen...
Do you like me?
Yeah...
A lot.
Would you still like me... even if I wasn't a girl...?
...What do you mean...?
I don't know...
I guess Why?
No reason...
So where are you guys from?
How come you moved here...?
We... move around a lot.
"Yeah, but why would you move here?"
Nobody moves here I hate it here
Someday I'm gonna get out...
And I'll never come back...
- Right.
Good-bye now.
I'll be right there.
Four more lagers!
Two bottles of champagne.
"Well, well!"
A big spender!
"Hey, where is this guy?"
Just as I thought!
"Ah, who cares?"
Mr. Show-off!
All this wonderful champagne!
We only live once!
Cheers!
I told you:
I'm not going in.
I'm not dressed for it.
"Well, in that case ―"
"Unlike you, Mr. Fancy-Pants."
Franz isn't gonna outdo me.
Careful that his big spending doesn't land us in jail.
He's a rookie!
He's showing off for me.
Have a good time.
"Hey, kitten!"
Leave the whole box.
How much is it?
- Fifteen marks.
Wait a minute.
Here's 20 marks.
Keep the change.
Let's drink.
I'll watch over you.
You'll be safe.
Thank you.
(Grunting)
(Panting)
(Grunts)
What happened here?
It's where the final battle was.
Give me your hand.
What?
Your hand... it's cut.
Let me help you.
- No.
No.
It's fine.
"- No, it's not."
So now you're gonna be a gentleman?
"(Whispers) Giants can smell blood, and I'm always a gentleman."
(Cork pops)
(Cork thuds)
Ah!
Oh!
What the hell is that?
It's rum.
A bloody waste of it.
(Panting)
Here's the plan.
We wait for the giant to fall asleep.
"When he does, we'll sneak past him into his cave."
"It's where the treasures are, where the compass lies."
And then?
And then we run like hell.
- Okay.
- Okay?
All right.
Here's the first thing I need you to do.
"You gotta curl up like this, into a ball."
"Real tight, like that."
As tight as you can.
Okay?
That's gonna keep you warm.
I'm gonna see what that light is.
"I'll be back as fast as I can, all right?"
Like a ball.
Like that.
Now sit tight.
All right.
"- Ben, can you hear me?"
- Yeah.
- All right.
Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Did you find something?
Come on!
"Hello, is anybody there?"
It was blocked.
- I'm so cold.
"- That's all right, buddy."
Can you wiggle your toes?
No.
That's okay.
How about your fingers?
Can you move those?
There you go.
No.
(Clinking) Think!
Bob's been picking her up all week.
She's been humming stupid songs all around the house.
(Grunts) Last night she came home with green glitter in her hair.
Oh.
Stop it!
"That's right, Sue."
Mom's still in the play.
(Gasps)
What?
!
"You know, when you said lunch and bowling,"
I didn't realize you could do it all in one awesome place.
(Chuckles) Yeah.
"Hey, you're a pretty good bowler, too, you know?"
What did you end up with?
39.
39.
That's pretty good for a 7-year-old.
"No, I'm 10."
Oh.
"Well, you should be better then."
(Brakes squeal)
Okay.
Time for you to take the wheel.
(Shifts gears) What?
"Well, you gotta learn to drive some time, don't ya?"
"Um, don't I have to be 16?"
(Chuckles) Who says?
The state does.
I don't have a license.
"Phew, it smells."
It's some kind of a gas.
Come on.
You OK now?
"Yes, thank you."
This is some kind of science place.
- How'd you get here?
- It was Tony.
He was here.
I saw something!
What was it?
It's where Tony is.
I'm sure of it!
"A big, round shape."
A doughnut!
He's eating a doughnut.
No way!
Is it like a ball?
A great big ball?
- Yes.
- I know where he is.
Let's go!
"Hurry, let's go."
"Oh, thank you."
And thanks for everything.
"Come on, let's go."
We are about to make scientific history.
"And some money, too, I hope."
You will shut down the complete cooling system of the furnace.
It's a red light on the cooling system.
It must be a circuit breaker.
Restart the system.
"Tell him he's got to call me, ok?"
"As soon as you talk to him, he's got to call me. lt's important."
He doesn't know I came here to see you.
It's like he's crazy.
-Take this. lt's a couple thousand.
"-Thanks, Jimmy."
"Don't worry, everything will be all right."
I got some beautiful Dior dresses.
You want to have them?
Pick out a few for yourself.
-For my mom.
"-Yeah, whatever."
Not here. ln the store on the corner.
"It's swag, so I got it down on the corner."
"Go ahead, sweetheart, I'll see you."
-Thanks.
-Don't worry.
-l'll try.
-He's got to call me.
Over here?
Right down there.
"It's over there, right on the corner."
"Yeah, it's over there."
Right there.
No!
Go ahead!
It's right in there!
"No, Jimmy!"
I'm in a hurry!
My mom's watching the kids!
I gotta get home!
I'll come back later!
"- No, because it happened before I knew him."
- Oh.
- So he didn't think of telling me.
- All right.
- But I was angry.
All right.
Down here - There are a lot of pictures over here.
- Right in the front.
"- Oh, upstairs?"
- I think so.
- Not here?
No.
"- No, not here."
- All right.
The front of the building - in the front.
Hmm.
"Well, do you know which way, Ida?"
Maybe over there?
I'm not sure.
- I don't know.
All I know is that when you come in.
- This is the front entrance here.
- It has to be here.
- So let's have a look.
"Ida, there's no pictures here."
"- Well, it is somewhere here."
"- Okay, let's turn around."
- Yeah.
- Let's turn around.
- Yeah.
- There's one more place.
- Okay.
He's not dead.
Death cannot touch him.
The demon will soon enter your home.
You've seen the demon?
At the house of the hanged woman.
It was a dream.
It was no dream.
I laid a trap for it.
"Wait here, until he's caught."
That's all you need to do.
What are you?
A woman or a ghost?
Why do you ask?
I need to know...
If I can put my faith in you.
"Just believe, and your family will be saved."
What are you?
Someone trying to save your daughter.
A woman.
I called all her friends...
Hyo-jin?
Hyo-jin!
Baby.
When will the demon come?
It's already there.
Hyo-jin.
It's already there?
Let me ask you one thing.
What is your true form?
What do you think is my true form?
The devil.
You're the devil.
I found it.
It's on the floor.
You should be nicer.
"Eat a D, Nancy."
Sorry about that.
"Dude, that was so embarrassing, man."
"Dude, we suck."
Hey.
I took it right out before I gave it back.
"I knew we had it, man!"
- Shh!
"- Way to go, dude."
"Ooh, gets you all..."
"adrenaline, endorphins."
- I know.
- It's like a drug.
I know.
"Hey, you think this is how she felt when she took us?"
"I mean, what if we don't even recognize her?"
She might not recognize us.
"We need to get cleaned up, man."
We're less than an hour away.
"Going out for a few hours, Viv."
- See you later.
"- Okay, have good day."
- Good.
You're still here.
"- Hello, Mr. Heller."
"I almost done and, get out of here."
I go now.
"No, stay."
Please.
It's a yellow school bus.
"I heard it on the radio, but I ain't seen no school bus."
Thank you.
"You kids, now, give me this."
"All right, get in back."
Stay back there.
You stay up here.
Leave your brother alone.
- Give me that.
"- Excuse me, sir."
What do you want?
I'm looking for a yellow bus.
"All right, give me that squirt gun."
"Look, all I'm looking to do is get out of here."
- Get up in the front.
- Thank you.
"Yellow school bus, have you seen one?"
Thank you.
Are you sure you didn't see a school bus?
"Okay, I'll talk to you later."
- Nothing.
- Me neither.
Tapia Park's just over the hill.
Let's check that out.
There it is.
- What's wrong?
"- Well, that baby food is poisoned."
L.A. 15-7 Mary 4.
Code 33.
Attention all units.
Code 33.
All frequencies clear.
Hey.
Is this from Vimy Ridge?
It is.
Did you shoot Germans in it?
Say again.
Did you shoot Germans in it?
Occasionally.
I can let myself in.
Mam might be asleep.
I'll just see you in.
What's this?
Herbert Kirkby.
From the choir.
Has he done something wrong?
"No, no."
"With it being late, I thought I'd see him to the door."
Right.
Yes.
"Very good, then."
"Baker did very well, as they all did."
The concert.
"He killed Germans in this, Mam."
Very nice.
"You go in, Baker, you chump."
"Sorry you missed it, Mrs Baker."
You'll perhaps manage for a future occasion.
Right.
"You won't be too cold, will you?"
No.
We're in the sun.
"We won't be sitting long, will we?"
"Now, lunch."
"But we haven't the book, have we?"
"And I don't suppose you know it from memory, do you?"
I know.
I know what we like.
You must sing for me.
No.
"Oh, no, not that."
- Why not?
- Not that.
Not in good voice?
"- It isn't that, sir, but..."
- But it's such a pretty song.
"- Please, not tonight."
- Yes.
Sing it gaily.
- I can't!
"Truly, I can't!"
- Sing it with deep compassion then.
Or loving kindness even.
"- Sing it moodily, sing it with..."
- I can't!
You hear me?
Sing it!
Sing it!
Smile when you sing!
Be happy!
Be gay!
That's it!
That's it!
That's it!
That's it!
That's it!
Only women can make us feel that way.
She dumped you?
It's a bit more complicated than that.
Figures.
It's always complicated with them.
I say if they make you suffer.
they don't deserve you.
I wasn't in love anyway.
Then.
You'll forget her soon enough.
- I guess.
Don't let it get you down.
Have some fun.
Go to...
I mean.
Do...
I don't know.
what you enjoy doing.
Yes.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
At your service.
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Welcome to Sextoon.
Do you want to compose a new...
- No.
Do you want to call your...
- Yes.
Hello.
Thomas.
I'm happy to see you.
- Who is it?
- Huh?
Nothing.
"Sorry, not here."
It's really not there?
"No, I looked everywhere."
"Well, could you see me down here for a second?"
Me?
Why?
Only for a little while.
I just want to buy you a nice meal.
"Alright, I'll be right down."
- Okay.
- Okay.
Where are you going?
Who was it?
It's Sunhee.
She wants to see me.
Why?
I don't know.
I'll be back soon.
Take your cellphone.
What's she got to say?
"Yeah, I have my phone."
When did you arrive here?
You saw me yesterday morning.
Sure my wallet's not there?
Why do you make me repeat the same answer?
I'm sorry.
Something very important to me is in there.
You wanted to see me because of that?
Not at all.
I'm his uncle!
Jong-gu!
"Heung-guk, how could you do this?"
Sergeant.
"Did it with this, I guess."
"Stabbed him, like, 20 times?"
Holy shit.
What's that?
Looks like the body was moved here after the murder.
What a mess.
That's Cho-the husband?
Looks that way.
I'll be damned.
And the kid?
We took him to a relative
Why'd he do it?
"I don't smell booze on him, but he's not talking."
Could be high on something.
How else could he end up like that?
What the hell happened?
"How's it going, Sergeant?"
I'm his uncle!
Let go of me!
Rotten bastard.
Couldn't he use GPS?
Why do I have to take him?
Ain't that it?
Get the wire cutters.
Pull it back.
What's that stink?
So.
Cho was killed here.
I see.
I see.
"Boy, today was so exhausting."
I had a really terrible client come.
Have a seat.
"Sorry, I'm sure you don't want to hear me complain."
"You're done with work, right?"
Wanna come over?
Maybe not... tonight.
"Oh, why?"
"Oh right, sorry..."
I haven't been giving you spending money lately.
What's wrong?
Take it.
I just... can't do this tonight.
Do you hate me now?
Why are you still here?
I got kind of hungry...
Let's order some sushi.
Hello.
I'm going to miss you.
Going to room 310.
Go ahead.
It's my last day.
Last day?
I'm going home to Korea.
"Here, I want you to have this."
Wait.
May I open it?
"You'll work at a top hotel, right?"
Right...
Then you'll need a bow tie.
What's going on?
I'd really rather not discuss it.
Not discuss what?
When a person says he'd really rather not discuss it...
Is it about the show?
No.
"So, then...?"
"Believe it or not, some things are not your concern."
"Well, tell me what it is, and I'll see if I agree."
"Is it, like, something serious?"
I'm not having this conversation.
"Yeah, we are."
Come on.
I care.
Tell me.
No!
"Okay, you're starting to freak me out."
"Is it, like, cancer?"
"No, it is not cancer."
"Well, I don't know."
Is it... is it bev?
Does she have...
No.
No one has cancer!
Ed has cancer.
What?
It's okay.
You didn't know.
Jesus Christ.
What is going on?
She slept with rob.
Who?
Hi.
Hi.
"Hey, what are you doing here?"
You all right?
"I'm fine, Jason."
I'm watching the show.
"We do have to get back before sunrise, though."
Let's get a move on.
"I don't think that's a good idea, Jason."
"Come on, hon."
Let's go.
We're very close.
"Jason, I'm not going anywhere."
"It pains me to say this, but I gotta let you go."
I love you.
But we cannot do this to each other anymore.
It's over.
It's over.
"Daddy, wait."
I was wrong.
I don't want to lose you.
I'll go back to the other side.
No.
Then you...
"You,d be doing what I did."
Trying to be something that you're not.
You're 20.
Go be 20.
All right?
I will not lose you.
All right?
I cannot lose you.
"I thought so, too."
- What else do you do?
- I'm a nurse.
I'm a nurse.
I'm better at nursing...
- Better?
- Better than at acting.
God!
I can't believe I'm in such a foul mood.
"Listen, you don't have to talk to me."
I just didn't want to be rude.
"Hey, welcome."
I can't find it.
"Oh, God, where are we?"
Go back the way we came.
Take the next right.
Are you OK?
Turn left in the village.
"Well, thanks."
Are you OK?
I'll be OK.
Thanks.
Wait a second.
Do you like to go to the movies?
Not really.
- Which movie do I have to see?
- Anything you like.
They're free tickets.
Thanks.
Amen.
"Are we getting a new horse, Dad?"
We're not going to make it.
The oldest and the ugliest.
You should beat me.
If you want...
-Beat her?
"-Come on, do it!"
"Move the lights, pay attention!"
"Get out of the way, quicly, quickly!"
Yeah you want me to hate you?
Whatever you want I'll do it.
I'm so ugly and you're so beautiful I think you should hit me.
"C'mon, hit me."
"Hit me,"
"You ugly old whore, you make me sick."
Cunt!
Let me see your beautiful cock.
And let me do it for you baby.
I'll do it and you could hit me if I do it wrong.
Beg for it.
You asked for it.
Let me see your beautiful cock.
"Come on baby, I'll do it good."
Come on.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
I can't.
Do it!
Do it!
I can't.
Beg for it.
Look at yourself.
Look at yourself.
Look at yourself.
"Oh, no."
"Oh, no, no."
I understand.
"You're just nervous and jumpy, that's all."
"- Yes, sir."
"- Yes, yes."
You have that cooped-up feeling.
Yes.
"You do understand, don't you?"
"- Yes, yes."
"- Well, then..."
"Well, now, where would we go?"
We might go to Albert Hall.
Yes.
And hear a symphony.
"Albert Hall, sir?"
"Well, I sort of hoped that..."
What makes you say...?
"So you'd like to go out, huh?"
"Yes, sir."
I'll go and put my things on.
Don't hurry.
Because we're not going.
Sir?
The bill is ever so good right here.
"Now, let's see, what shall we do?"
We could play cards.
"But you're probably tired of cards, aren't you?"
You might read to me.
Yes.
Yes.
Milton's Paradise Lost would be nice.
"No, I don't think so."
"Oh, I got myself something there."
What?
A barrette.
"Oh, stop it, Carrie."
You got my shirt at the big and tall shop and you were hiding the bag from me.
"Ok, fine."
I'm sorry.
"Oh, man, I can't believe this."
"At most I thought I was, like, the biggest size at Macy's."
When did I make the crossover?
"2 years ago, Christmas."
"Oh, God!"
"Come on, honey."
What's the big deal?
It's just a big and tall store.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, let me break it down for you."
I'm certainly not tall.
You're tall.
Sure you're tall.
"What are you, 6'2""?"
"I'm 5'9""."
That's pretty damn tall.
"Oh, would you come on?"
All right.
Maybe you're a little bit big.
Why is this even a discussion?
The man is gargantuan.
"Ok, what else came from the big and tall shop?"
Tell me.
What-- this belt?
- No.
Oh no you didn't.
"Listen, it doesn't matter."
"Arrest all of us, okay."
Just take us with you.
Just get us out of here.
Help me!
Don't trust her!
"No, wait."
They're with me.
They saved me.
It's him.
He's been keeping me prisoner for weeks.
You.
Get your face on the ground right now.
He's a psychopath.
He did things to me.
I told you she's innocent.
"My God, are you all right?"
"C'mere, it's gonna be okay."
Just take me away.
Oh God.
C'mere.
Angie.
"Angie, I need backup right now."
"It's over, I can't believe it's over."

Why?
"Those videos that we saw, who was holding the camera?"
There was someone else in the room.
"Angie, I need back up right now."

Abby.
What's yours...?
I'm Owen.

Twelve.
More or less.
What about you?
"Twelve years, eight months, and nine days what do you mean, ""more or less""...?"
When's your birthday?
I don't know.
You don't know?
Don't you celebrate your birthday?
- Don't you get birthday presents?
- No.
Well... you can... have this.
If you want.
That's okay.
It's yours.
I really don't get how you did this Want me to show you?
Yeah...
"I must be gone and live, or stay and die..."
"Yon light is not day-light,"
I know it
"It is some meteor that the sun exhales,"
What were you writing back there...?

In Cook's class.
Let's see it...

"My, my."
Thank you.
My...
My pleasure.
Come and look at it.
What's it like?
Good.

I can't do this.
So many things you can't do.
"You can't swim, you can't run..."
You can't fuck.
"Oh, dear."
How d'you know that?
"But you can, Tony Stonem."
You can fuck me right now.
"- No, I couldn't."
- You want to.
"Hey, fuck you!"
I got hit by a fucking bus.
That fucks you up.
"Well, fuck you right back."
You're just not trying hard enough.
You must be so happy the way you are.
Why do you care if my dick can get hard or not?
This is fucked up beyond words.
Coward.
Fucking coward.
Coward.

Little while.
Not long.
We were ambushed.
Yeah.
"So, what?"
What?
They wanted to stop the broadcasts?
You know as much as I do.
"Yeah, but we didn't do anything wrong."
Right?
We were ambushed.
Sit back down.
All the audio files are there.
We had nothing to do with it.
So...
They can't blame us for anything.
Why are you looking at me like that?
-We're fine.
We were ambushed.
-Calm down.
I am calm.
But what are we gonna do next?
-Stop walking around on your leg.

Look.
I'd like to talk with you.
But not here.
With all that make-up.
I want to talk with you at your home.
I can't.
- Give me your calling code.
I can't see patients outside of work.

Dad?
What?
Is it morning?
You were asleep?
"Yeah, I was."
What's going on?
Well...
I wanted to talk about Ryan.
"Yeah, I know, it's cool."
We don't need to discuss it.
"Well, I think we do."
"I mean, I know you're upset, your mother and I are upset."
But our responsibility is... is to our family.
"Yeah, that's okay."
"No, I get it."
"I mean, this is a person's life we're talking about and we need to leave it in the hands of the authorities."
There's no need for sarcasm.
I'm not being sarcastic.
"Well, it's hard to tell sometimes."
Dad... it's okay.
Really.
When you want to talk about it...
"Yeah, I know."
You're the one to talk to.
Got it.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.

Hey.
For my brothers.
They are all I think about.

I don't know.
Because I'm...
Stuck here.
Yeah.
There's something here.
It's from my team.
This means the new moon.
- The light.
- When's that?
- Tonight.
- And this?
It means they can only hide five men.
You and four more.
***
It's the best chance we have.
It's your call.
The truck is hidden in the woods.
Aurora has the keys.
Good.
Gun.
- Why would I give you a gun?
- You need help.
I can help.
What do you know about guns?
You aim and squeeze and your target dies.
How do I know I can I trust you?
You don't yet.
What's going on?
These men have experience training soldiers.
"Well, I don't like to see a dog killed either."
"But after all, 250 bucks is 250 bucks."
"All right, I told you I'm buying him, and I am."
- We ain't got no time to fool with him.
"- Quiet, quiet."
Whose money is this?
"Listen, you, you're my dog, and I'm your boss."
"The sooner you learn that, the easier it's going to be for both of us."

This is a great way to stretch.
Yep.

You could do this with your partner at home.
Sure.
Let's ride this energy out!
Keep your chin up.
Yep.
"Yes, this fire has just started."
And we will not put it out.
What is he doing?
I don't really know that pose.
"Okay, now we go into the happy baby pose."
"No, no, no, no, no, no."
Please regard me.
I'm sorry?
"Please, allow me."
To do what?
Regard me.
Okay.
Yes.
Okay.
"You are doing fantastic, my dear."
Do you think I'm bad?
No.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
How can you be sure?
I know.
You're good.
"Well, since I'm good, can you get me a bowl to fetch milk?"
"When I go to the fields, I'll find one."
I want it now.
It will only take two minutes.
I'm late.
I have to go.
That lady will find you one.
Go on.
"Mim Hamideh, hello."
Do you have a milk bowl for the engineer?
"Yes, by the window."
All right.
She says to bring the bowl back.
I have to go.
Off you go.
May God give you pride.
May God give you good health.
May God give you a long life.

Aren't we going back?
"We still have some time, right?"
For what?
I want to be with you a bit longer.
When he comes...
He'll take a while to get back.
Let's just go somewhere.
Where?
Anywhere.
Let's just look for a place.
"Ah, here."
They don't even have a front desk.
Isn't it the one outside?
Is it?
Let's try the second floor.
They're all empty.
No one's here.
This is crazy.
"- No, please don't."
- I think I'm going crazy.
Be patient.
Let's meet in Seoul.
He'll go nuts if he finds out.
But I want to have you.
So bad.
- Really?
"- Yes, really."
For real.
"Then, strip."
Everything?
I don't really know you.
I....
I just feel connected to you.
I feel....
"I feel safe with you, like it's okay to be honest."
It's just one of those things.
I'm just attracted to you.
And it's not just because I think you're incredibly sexy.
"I think that you're incredibly attractive too, Sara."
I do.
You do?
Yeah.
I think about you.
Trust me.
A lot.
How do you think about me?
How?
Yeah.
Do you think about having sex with me?
Yeah.
How?
How do I think about having sex with you?
Yeah.
Do you think about me going down on you?
Yeah.
-That's part of it.
"-Yeah, me too."
I think about how you'd taste.
I'm sure you'd taste sweeter.
-Do you resist me?
-No.
-Do you give yourself over?
He's my friend too.
We really grew on each other.
Thanks.
I am counting on you.
"Don't worry about us, and watch your back."
The baron has hired some butchers to guard the place.
Fire!
Fire!
Fire?
!
Where is the fire?
"The warehouse with medicinal herbs from Ming, sir!"
"Oh, no!"
You must find his journal.
That's the only way to bring the baron down.
He won't store it in an obvious place.
He will keep it very close to him.
That idiot!
You!
Guards!
Guards!
Come quickly!
Guards!
Thief!
That way!
Go now!
Go!
But...
Just go!
I got you covered.
What?
!
It won't be a problem at all.
Good.
We're on.
What's really funny is that fucking bank job in Secaucus.
I'm in the weeds lying down.
Resting.
Here?
"This ain't no beach or park."" ""I'm resting!"" I said."
this and that.
My usual.
Nothing.

Anthony.
My head was out like this.
I'm coming around and who do I see in front of me?
"""What do you want to tell me now?"
What are you doing here?
I said to go fuck your mother.
I thought he'd shit.
The fuckers.
I wish I was big just once.
Funny.
You're really funny.
I'm funny?
you know.
It's a good story.
You're a funny guy.
You mean the way I talk?
What?
you know.
You're just funny.
"Come on, let's sit down."
Here's to the family.
Salute.
"I'm so charged, Sonny."
I never felt this way before in my whole life.
"I know, man, it's a great feeling."
"I mean, things are looking up."
This has got to be the beginning of some good stuff for us.
You know?
It's got to be.
"I'm so happy for you, man."
"Thanks, man."
How's the club?
It's great.
I couldn't ask for anything better.
I got more money than I know what to do with.
That's the way it should be.
"Yes, sir."
Oh.
We're smiling.
Must've been when we first landed.
Yeah.
You know who's in that picture?
You and me.
No.
It's me... and the godfather of my son.
You're kidding.
"That's what Julia wants, too?"
Yeah.
What do you say?
Yeah!
You bet!
I know.
Put it under there.
What are you doing that for?
I'm just passing the time.
"If you really love me, then let's make a vow... right here, together... right now."
- Okay?
- Okay.
All right.
Repeat after me-
I'm gonna be free.
I'm gonna be free.
And I'm gonna be brave.
I'm gonna be brave.
Good.
And the next one is-
I'm gonna live each day as if it were my last.
"Oh, that's good."
You like that?
Yeah.
Say it.
I'm gonna live each day as if it were my last.
Fantastically.
Fantastically.
Courageously.
Courageously.
With grace.
With grace.
You don't have to bubble-wrap everything.
It's not like you're moving to the north pole.
Oh.
That's not yours.
Get some air.
Go on.
- God.
- Take it easy.
"Breathe in, breathe out."
All right.
"I'm gonna stand up, all right?"
Because I got bad knees.
That's better.
"Okay, now listen."
The three of us are gonna work this out.
Yeah?
How?
"First thing, you'll put a dollar in my pocket, both of you."
"You want attorney-client privilege, don't you?"
So that everything you say is strictly between us.
I mean it.
Put a dollar in my pocket.
"Come on, make it official."
"Come on, do it."
"That's it, come on."
Just a dollar.
"All right, now you, ski bum."
Come on.
Give with the dollar.
- Go on.
- Be smart.
What?
- All I got is a five.
- I'll take a five.
"Come on, already."
Come on.
You can give it back tomorrow.
...How do you do it?
You gotta make each side all one color.

...You smell kinda funny.
Aren't you cold?
I don't really get cold
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.
Help me Hello?
Please...
Help me Hello?
Hey there...
Are you okay?
What happened?
I fell...
Yeah...?
Can't you get up...?
No...
"How old are you, sweetheart?"
Do you live around here...?
I live right here...
Can you carry me...?
"Okay, sweetheart... sure..."
Why don't you... here...
You got it...?
you expect me to clean it up now...!
don't you?
...fucking bitch!
How did you do it?
!
I just... twisted it.
Do I smell better now?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Renee!
Let me in.
Where's John?
Ain't he with you?
No.
"What do you mean, ""no""?"
"Cliff, where is he?"
As...
"As soon as I heard the police coming in, I told him to get out."
I screamed at him that he had to go.
But you saw him leave?
"Where is he, then?"
Where's David?
Did he make it back?
He's... waiting for us at Reg's.
"Cliff, please, do the right thing and let him go."
You can take responsibility for this.
- What are you on about?
- David's not like you.
He won't cope in prison.
Give him a chance to get away.
Nobody's going to prison.
Look.
You should have seen what we left behind.
There's enough here.
Grab your case.
Come on.
"I'm staying here, in case John comes back."
"Cooper, get to the door."
"It's gonna be like my mum, I don't know, dead."
- Your mum?
- Fucking swinging from a fucking beam.
- Your mother is not in there.
- You're not in control of this!
It's in my head.
It fucking knows.
It knows.
- It knows!
- It knows what?
It knows I got this thing with my mum.
"Cooper, I promise you, she's not in there."
- Now open the door.
"- Oh, my God."
It's the only way I can get you out.
Listen to me.
"Okay, Okay."
Fuck.
Okay.
Whatever's in there cannot harm you.
"But I can't get you out unless you open that door, Cooper."
Okay.
Would you kindly open the door?
Here we go.
Here we go.
Okay.
"Okay, okay, I'm in the room."
Where's the access point?
Access point?
- There is no access point.
- What?
We're going to have a baby.
"Which, frankly, scares the hell out of me."
It'll be great.
Yeah.
"I'm sure it will, at times."
And at times I'm sure I'll be exhausted and angry and think I've made a total mess of my life.
I'll be there.
"You will, won't you?"
Even if I get confused and strange and horrible.
"Yeah, I'll do my best."
"I will, too."
"Connie, we're gonna have a baby."
I know.
That's great.
LUC:
I'm... (STAMMERlNG)
I'm going to be a father!
You're going to be an aunt!
(CONNlE laughing)
"Girls,"
I think you should come upstairs.
I'll be right here.
"You will, won't you?"
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's good.
"That's very, very good."
Commander.
What is it?
A group of people escaped the blockade.
What?
I just didn't know if you'd like it.
It's fine.
It's fine.
It's for covering blood.
It doesn't have to match the drapes.
You want to hold him?
"He's fed, changed and burped... happy."
It's the perfect time.
"Well, you... you've got him."
Violet...
"Okay, breathe in and out."
"Shh, shh, shh."
Remember what we said?
"This time, you're just gonna breathe in and out."
You're just gonna stand there and wait.
Shh.
I can't.
I can't.
I can't.
"No... yes, you're just gonna stand there and wait until I open the door."
Breathe in and out.
Do not go in...
The closet.
"I told you, don't ring the bell."
"Oh, oh."
Did I wake him?
No.
She's in the closet again.
Don't worry.
I'm handling it.
"Yeah, no, no."
I can...
Take it nice and easy now.
- Eyes forward.
- Nice and easy.
That hand down!
- Nice and easy.
- They're on him!
Damn.!
I'd love to kill you.!
- What the...
- You got it?
- Cigarettes.
- Ha!
I wish you'd run.
I'd love to kill you.
I would love to kill you.
"But you can't run, 'cause you're busted.!"
Eyes forward!
Eyes forward!
I don't like you.
Keep your gun on him.!
Keep your gun on him.!
"Ain't nothing gonna help you, Hammond."
"I'm sorry about all this, Mr. Voss."
Your daughter is a fine young lady.
"This is the money shot, Ned."
The father-daughter reunion.
- Beautiful.
- He didn't hurt me.
He's innocent.
- He's innocent!
- Later.
That really was funny.
- Who is this man?
Just a guy that works here.
Little bit screwy.
"Go on, stand over there, will you?"
He gets excited.
"Well, we'll be going, judge."
We'll make our report to the state board.
"- Goodbye, judge."
- Goodbye.
"I want you to do me a favor, Mr. Gargan."
I want you to stay here.
"For a time, anyway."
And run this place.
Don't worry.
I'll be here.
"- Goodbye, Miss Griffith."
"- Goodbye, Judge Gilbert."
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- And good luck.
- Thanks very much.
- So Joe's all right?
- I'm afraid he's gonna live.
"You can go back, tell him the racket is his."
- What?
- The racket and the whole 5000 votes.
- After you nearly killing the guy?
- Go on.
Beat it.
- Are you staying here?
- Yep.
- So am I.
- [Indistinct]
- Get out of here.
- You.
"Come on, you, baldy."
Come on.
"Come on, move."
"All right, put it on the bar."
- What are you pullin' on me for?
- Get it on the bar.
Get the hell in there.
Put your hands on your head.
All of it.
"Smartass, you dropped something."
Pick it up.
You want that hand broken?
Get it up there.
"What else you got here, huh?"
[Cloudy] Turn around.
You're under arrest.
That goes for you too.
Get in that phone booth.
"Come on, move."
Move!
- Keep 'em up.
Keep 'em up.
That's good.
- Get in there.
"All right, face the wall, put your hands against the wall and lock yourself in."
"Hey, you, haircut."
- Where are you going?
"- You talkin' to me, baby?"
"Yeah, I'm talking to you."
You might be able to catch him.
Come with me.
But-
Please!
Go to see him in Ito.
He's important for you.
Do you have money?
"Yes, I have some."
Good.
"When you see him, give him my regards."
Yes.
You're going to get me into trouble
What have you been doing these days?
"It's incredibly hard to be with you, but at the same time,"
I'm so lonely without you.
I'm terrible.
It's too late.
Too late for what?
Why?
"No, let me go."
It's late.
Let's go home.
I've always considered you very important.
I'm in your heart.
I still do.
"Well, good night."
What are you doing here?
It's a holiday.
What's wrong with you?
"You look sick, you know."
I went to see Kayama-sensei.
Did you see him?
Hurry.
Why are we going downstairs?
I need to show you something.
"We got you, we got you."
"Let's go, let's go."
How did you?
"I heard the buzz, then I played dead."
Played dead?
Of course you did.
Oh wait.
"Connor, I..."
Riley.
I'm so sorry.
Thought I'd say goodbye.
Hey.
"I'm sorry, man."
You were the best crew I've ever had.
Listen...
"If I get out of here,"
"I swear to you,"
"I swear to you,"
I'm gonna buy your girl those boobs.
"I love you, bro."
"Oh, Connor."
No!
"It's all right, it's all right, it's all right."
It's all right.
I should have told you I tried that.
"All right, come on man."
"We gotta move, we gotta move."
What are we gonna do?
We gonna hide and wait it out?
Yeah?
Can you see what I'm doing?
It's not that nice.
- Are you all right?
"- Yeah, I'm fine."
I'm sorry.
So are we still on for tonight?
Yeah.
"Yeah, yeah."
"So, like, 8:00, right?"
You want me to pick you up?
"Yeah, 8:00."
I'll be waiting.
"All right, cool."
Bye.
Who was that?
Just this friend.
Do you have a friend I don't know?
This guy from school.
Going through a divorce.
"By the way, I was going to ask you a favor."
What?
What?
"I was gonna go out with him tonight and Jenna fucking hates him, so I'm just gonna tell her I'm with you, if that's cool."
You're fucking around on her.
What?
It's a guy from school.
No.
"Don't get me involved in this, please."
How can you fuck around on Jenna?
She's perfect.
She's beautiful.
A little too rich for my blood.
Maybe they fell out of your pocket— or maybe Cindy's.
"Now, you go home and you sleep... and you wake up and you guide the traffic through this town... and everything will be the way it was."
I'm taking him in tomorrow morning at 6:00.
That's in a few hours.
"I'd like you to come with me, Ray."
There's nothing I can say?
Okay.
Then 6:00 it is.
Yeah.
"No, Lis."
Who was he supposed to call?
Ray knows everybody.
What am I supposed to do?
Let him go in alone?
What?
You know what?
"Okay, fine."
Why don't you go home?
I mean...
"I wanna be here for you, Freddy, but—"
"Lisa's nervous, you know."
She's pregnant.
- I mean—
"- So, go on."
I'll be fine.
Yeah.
"You be careful, Freddy."
Yeah.
You too.
Shut the fuck up!
"Would ya, please?"
I can take the pills myself.
"Okay, fine."
Will you come visit?
You call and we'll make a date.
"I'll get some licorice, coffee, tea, whiskey."
You name it.
Okay.
"Take care of yourself, alright?"
Thank you for everything.
I'll be waiting.
"Let's go by the house first, I'll change my shirt."
"But I brought the one you wanted, it looks nice on you."
Where do you want to sit?
- Next to you.
I don't want to go.
You're kidding me.
"Goni, please."
"Daddy, do as I say."
Don't talk to your father like that.
Don't tell me what to do.
Goni.
Let's give it a pass.
I can't.
Daddy.
Daddy!
Daddy!
Come on.
I'm sorry.
"I'm sorry, come on."
You'll be okay.
Mr. Ben-Shmuel.
Alex Dolgin's secretary asked me to take you to the rehearsal.
"Oh, God."
"- All right, sad-arse?"
- Nina just rang from the hospital.
He's taken a turn for the worse.
But he's been asking for you.
"Look, we've done our best but he is... he's just too weak."
"Do you understand, Adam?"
"Well, look, we'll... we'll give you some time alone with him, OK?"
Dad?
Adam.
"I'm here, Dad."
Why?
What's happened?
You collapsed.
You weren't well.
You collapsed.
Are you all right?
Have you fed?
Here.
It's OK.
I've got these people looking after me.
"But they... they understand, do they?"
It's fine.
They're nice.
"Now, you give me a minute and we'll get out of here, hey?"
"No, listen."
You have to stay here.
I'm just...
I'm just so... so tired.
"You gave me too much, Dad."
You made yourself weak.
What else could we do?
- They can put the finger on you.
"- Quit waiting there, will you?"
Keep in touch.
Let me know what the doctor says.
- Get our doctor if you have to.
Come on.
- Wait a minute.
"Listen, Patsy, I'm asking you, don't go up there, will you?"
- All right.
- Wouldn't that mean--?
"Now, boys."
"Now, wait."
Now wait.
Now let's be sensible.
"Now, let's start all over again."
I'll change everything back to what it was before.
- I swear I will.
I'll change and--
- You're a liar.
"We, the jury, find you guilty of murder in the first degree."
Where did--?
Where--?
- Let's go.
Get him.
- Hurry up.
Hurry up and get him.
Let's hurry up and get him.
"Come on, boys, let's go."
Come on.
"Hurry, Patsy."
He's dead.
"Hey, come on."
"""Just tell her we're getting married""?"
"Oh, my God."
He's only 20 years old.
I've never even heard of this girl.
And how does that make you feel?
"Uh, ""my mom got married young... and still regrets it."""
That ought to do it.
"""Are you trying to tell me something?""..."
"What, is she stupid?"
"""Just that we should slow down."""
"""I h8 u, d'bag."""
What does that mean?
"Well, 8 could be ate."
"Like, ""I ate something."""
- Mm.
- And d'bag is like da bomb?
"I hate you, douche bag."
"Hey, Elka."
Thanks for letting me borrow this.
Oh.
What did you think of my mall walk mix?
Not bad.
A little surprised by all the Justin bieber.
Really?
I love her.
He's a guy.
They keep saying that.
But I'm not buying it.
What am I gonna do?
I-I broke them up.
He's gonna hate me.
"Oh, will."
"No, I cannot leave the ruins."
But their revenge will be carried out.
The four pirates are condemned.
They will perish.
We will go to meet them!
You will be too late.
That doesn't matter.
We've finally got you.
You will die here!
You little she-devils!
No magic can save you this time.
Stupid whores!
Take advantage of them again!
Tear it!
More.
Go on!
Tear!
Trash.
Bitch.
"Here I go, slut."
Hit the sluts!
Blood!
"Oh, yes!"
It's gonna hurt.
I'm gonna
- I'm gonna -
"Hurts, doesn't it?"
Arching -
You liked it?
Stop it.
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?
"Higher, all the way."
That's it.
You're awful big for 12.
"Oh, it's glands."
The whole family had glands.
"Why, my mother was 6'4""."
We called her shrimp.
"If you're only 12, you're pretty young to be traveling alone."
"Oh, well, that's all right."
I'm not scared.
I'm going be a space cadet.
Where are you going?
Home.
"Oh, here it is right here."
You're going to... (GROANING)
What's the matter?
"Oh, I'm train sick!"
The rocking.
Here's your ticket.
"Oh, I..."
I'm train sick.
The...
The rocking of the train.
I'm really sick.
I get nauseous on a train from rocking and when it goes fast and it shakes back and forth.
I'm really very sick from the train.
Would you please keep quiet?
Yeah.
"I dropped my gun, mister."
Wow!
(TITTERING)
My gun shoots milk.
But it's a bit late now.
She's a pretty girl.
I can see why you liked her.
Just one kiss and then we'll go and join the others.
What would you do without me?
Luke.
Lukey.
"I'm dying, mate."
I'm dying.
Just don't know that.
I've got holes in me.
I'm losing blood.
It's not rocket science.
I need a doctor... or I'm dead.
"One call, Luke."
"Give me one phone call, that's all I ask"
Just... just to give me a fighting chance.
I'm begging you.
That's it.
What're you doing?
"Luke, focus."
"We need... we need a phone, Luke."
Luke!
"Sorry, man."
Sorry.
This'll ease the pain.
"- Get away from me, you fucking coward!"
- I'm trying to help!
Luke.
Give me some.
What have you ever done for me?
"Everyone knows I'm a bitch, Luke."
We'll get you out of here.
- What's your name?
- Ben.
"Hey, Ben."
I'm Doug.
Let's see if I can move some of this stuff out of the way here.
- How did you get caught in here?
- We were by the canal and the water started coming real fast.
"- Just get it out, please."
Just get it out!
- Mom told us to stay out of the tunnel.
"It ain't my fault, Joey."
The water just pushed me.
"All right, settle down, fellas."
It's nobody's fault.
- Are you okay?
- I'm cold and my leg hurts.
Let me take a look at it.
It's your lucky day.
I'm a doctor.
- Let me check this.
Does this hurt?
"- Yeah, a lot."
- Try not to move it.
- Is it broken?
- It might be.
"- Oh, no."
"- No, no...."
"- Don't cry, Ben."
"Yeah, Ben."
Don't cry.
It's nothing compared to what I've seen.
"- Yes, I do."
I gotta go.
This isn't right.
"- Yeah, it is."
"- No, no, no."
"Kim, it isn't."
And I don't know what I thought was gonna happen tonight.
I definitely know what I hoped was gonna happen tonight.
But this isn't cool.
"I really, really, really want to have sex with you."
Yeah.
I can tell.
- You can tell that?
- Yeah.
Subtle signs.
But I can't.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
Michael?
Okay.
It's gonna be okay.
He's gonna come home.
He's gonna come home.
He's gonna come home.
"Hey, this is Michael..."
Do something for me.
What?
"Go home, tell her that it's over and leave her."
- I can't.
- What?
You're an amazing guy.
You wouldn't be here with me right now unless you knew something was missing in your life.
Don't kill her.
Of course not.
"But you, on the other hand..."
No!
Don't!
"Please, please."
No!
"Please, please."
David!
Please!
No!
You'll do exactly what we want.
You'll broadcast my numbers because now you know every choice has a consequence.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
My God.
Try the other zones.
Who's in the basement?
Let's see what's down there.
We're clear.
My God.
He only fired two shots.
"Oh, my God, it's David."
"Oh, my God!"
They must have thought he was dead.
Bled out.
He knew there was a gun hidden down here.
You still with me?
"Yeah, feel nauseous."
"Yeah, well, puke if you have to."
I haven't puked since college.
Why did it have to be curry?
You like curry.
Since when?
What's wrong with her?
All right.
Wait!
You can't do it like that.
"She's a bride, she should look like a bride."
Like this.
What do you think?
"It's good, right?"
"Yes, it's fine."
"- Okay, you can take it."
"- All right, I'll take the picture."
Look here.
"Three, two-"
Wait!
"Hyang Gi, don't stick too close."
Why is the bride smiling so much?
"Hold the flower up, and you come out a bit, so that your face will come out smaller."
"- Good, right?"
- Yes.
"So that your face will be smaller, right."
"Okay, okay..."
Okay...
- Are the lights fine?
- Yes.
Can you take the picture slightly lower?
Right?
I think that'll be better.
"Ji Hyung, smile!"
Smile!
- And how.
- But you seem to be doing well.
- I'm great.
- But you seem to be doing well.
- I'm great.
"Why wouldn't you be great, with a friend like Russ here?"
- Yeah.
"Look at that, huh?"
"- Oh, jeez."
"Oh, boy."
How about that?
"Don't say a word, not one."
"Cause if i hear one comment like, ""What are you talking about?""..."
- I'm gonna call the cops.
- What?
Wh-What do you mean?
It slipped out.
We're listening.
Go ahead.
"I chewed on it for three days, and I'm convinced I have evidence to fuck you both up big time."
Bull.
You don't have any evidence.
What is that?
- Stop it.
Shut up.
You shut up.
- You shut up.
Shut up!
No.
That's bullshit.
"Dick, you have the floor."
You have the floor.
"Now, you say it."
Is beautiful.
Tonight.
What?
What?
What're you doing?
"You're the guy's wife, Cora."
You told me that.
You were gonna leave me?
-I was writing you a note.
-Were you writing me a thank-you note?
-Is that what you were doing?
"-Cora, look."
Live here.
Live with the guy.
"Took a chance, we didn't make it."
Live with the man.
He wants to have a baby.
You understand?
He's changed.
He says the accident changed him and now I'm supposed to have his kid.
"How am I gonna do that, Frank?"
How am I supposed to have his baby?
I can't have his baby.
The only one I could have a baby by is you.
Okay.
Say you won't leave me.
Please.
"Just stall him, babe."
Just stall him.
-Going far?
-We're goin' to Ventura.
You know what?
I need to un-know that!
Your friend is here.
Chuck.
Thanks for coming.
"Yeah, well, I don't have a lot of time, so can we do this?"
"Hey, no, don't!"
Don't!
Shut up.
Do it.
"Okay, this is gonna sting a little at first, but after a few seconds, you're gonna be feeling much more cooperative."
"No, stop it!"
"Help me hold him, please."
Don't!
"Okay, I'm giving him a low dose, but he's gonna conk out any minute, so you guys are gonna have to act fast."
There we go.
All right.
Let's take this again.
Where's his ex-wife?
I-c-
- I c-
- I can't.
Just relax.
That's it.
Calm down.
Where did you hide her?
Cy-
- Cyprus.
She's in Nicosia...
Under the name...
Yasmine...
Sadek.
Hey...
Come on.
She killed them here.
The old woman got it the worst of it.
Her head was smashed open like a watermelon.
You saw with your own eyes?
Of course I did.
How?
The old woman tells me the Jap is a ghost.
He was gonna suck her blood dry.
The Jap?
Yeah.
The Jap with the limp.
"Oh, him!"
You've seen him?
Yeah.
How many times?
Once or twice.
Be careful.
Why?
"The old woman says, if you keep seeing him around, it's because he's stalking you."
To suck your blood dry.
Wait here for a second.
Okay.
Get your ass over here.
What?
Get over here now!
But I just found the dermatologist.
I found a witness.
"So, get over here as fast as you can."
What the...?
Where'd she go?
"We're here with you, Stan."
Stan.
Stan.
Now do you believe me?
Shut up.
There must be an explanation.
You sure you put him in the incinerator?
Yeah.
He's ashes.
I don't know who or what we just saw but it's not the same guy.
That cold.
"He's here in the house, with us."
"It's like ice in here, boss."
"What I don't understand is, why did he come to this house?"
Has he ever been here before?
Never.
I barely knew him.
I met you all for the first time last night.
Go.
Let's go.
Wait.
Don't leave me.
"Please, don't leave me."
Go on and see what it is.
He's been gone five minutes.
Where the devil is he?
I don't know.
Maybe he's with Stan.
I'm going up there.
Look!
One of my murderers is dead.
The others will also die.
I will never let him near you.
Okay?
Ever.
I know you won't.
Good?
Yeah.
Riley and I will sweep this area.
Thank you.
Can I have my gun back?
No.
"Come on, just, come on."
"You guys know what a jammer looks like, right?"
Does it have like a fan on it?
Fuck.
I knew he'd find a way to fuck this up.
He always does.
He has not changed at all.
"Ollie, can you please just stop?"
He's still my brother.
It's not in here.
What the hell?
I already checked there.
What?
Nothing.
"Dude, I'm just sayin', don't let 'im talk to you like that."
Fuck 'im.
"No, seriously, you say the word,"
"I'll clan his ass, son."
"Don't worry about it, all right."
I need you to focus.
"Come on, Riley."
Help me out.
Good!
# This is Flora's holiday... #
Yes!
# This is Flora's holiday. #
"Good night, Mr Kirkby."
Night.
I'm meeting my dad.
See you!
"See you, Hewitt."
"We've done the chairs, Mr Kirkby."
"Are you all right, Mr Kirkby?"
It's this leg.
Gets bad in the cold.
Just need a minute.
Do you want me to go and tell you when the bus is coming?
Then you don't have to stand in the cold.
I walk home.
I'm only down Pattison Street.
That's near me.
"I can walk with you, sir."
I don't think you walk as slow as me.
I can do.
I like walking slow.
"And if I walk on the side of your cold leg it might warm it up, and then it might feel better."
You can lean on me.
I'm dead strong.
I'm always carrying coal and spuds and that for Mam.
"Come on, Tubby!"
Hello!
"Oh, you came."
"Pauline, this is Tubby."
"You remember, I told you."
"Look, we gotta find a weapon."
All right?
There's nothing here.
What are you gonna do with that tiny knife?
Who are you?
- Who are you?
"- No, no."
Wait.
"Stay away, stay away."
We're not gonna hurt you.
"It was Vivian, right?"
Yeah.
Where's that guy that was with you?
I don't know.
I don't know him.
He was...
He was behind me.
Gimme your phone.
You have a phone?
Did you call someone?
"We did, we, got a call out."
Are they coming?
We're not sure.
They're not coming.
"The signal was in and out, but, it still might have gone through."
"Look, Vivian, we need to find a way out."
I can't.
I can't.
"Do you know of anything, any way out?"
Are you sure he was behind you?
Yes.
I don't trust her.
We will see how she does in the office.
I am sure she is going to do well.
"She is my friend, after all."
- Yeah.
"Anyway, you guys carry on."
I will see you later.
Yeah?
You witch..
'I am writing this diary only because..'
'..my mom wants me to maintain a diary.'
'My first day in office today.'
Gul.
"Hi, mom."
How are you?
I am fine.
You tell me.
I told you to call me up after you reach office.
"I am so sorry, mom."
I was very busy with office work.
You always make excuses.
Your papa misses you a lot.
Okay.
Tell me.
How is your office?
"Very good, mom."
Even my boss is very friendly.
Gul.
"Okay, mom."
I got to go.
Pia is calling me.
I am very late for office.
Listen.
Flank right.
Don't move!
(GRUNTS)
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Initializing Amity Sim.
JEANINE:
"Back again, are we?"
You're an even bigger fool than your mother.
"Say whatever you want to me, Jeanine."
But I'm not gonna fight you.
How very Amity of you.
I mean it.
I'm not gonna fight you.
Of course you're not.
You're gonna fight her.
The one you really hate.
What are you?
(SCOFFS)
"I'm you, Tris."
I'm the real you.
(PANTING)
I'm not gonna fight you.
I'll make you fight me.
You're not me.
I am.
I'm what they see when they look at you.
You killed Will.
And your parents.
You're deadly.
That's enough!
"No one's gonna love you, Tris."
They're never even gonna miss you.
man?
Of course he's cool.
I don't know how you're not nervous.
I'm freaking out.
Will you shut the fuck up?
You shouldn't even be here.
I'm Kent.
I spoke with you on the phone.
- How's it going?
- Good good.
huh?
- Yeah.
Every high roller in the county must be here.
- It is quite the event.
- Your boy ready?
He's always ready.
I was thinking--
Kent.
Let's get this thing started.
All right.
Let's do it.
We need to get the bets in.
Bullshit.
I'll cover anybody lays off on Victor.
let's have a good show.

"It's an island rum, infused with the essence of the coconut fruit."
Delicious.
Yes?
You like?
Very much.
Yes.
That's yummy.
It is yummy.
"It's yummy, yummy, yummy, isn't it?"
Mmm.
Yes.
"Oh, oh..."
"Slow down there, killer."
"You see, this island has so many healing curiosities."
"You know, it is good to have a drink and have a good time."
Then do it!
"Well, I guess we just go around, huh?"
"No, we gotta go through."
The path ends.
"We go off the path, we get lost+ Come on."
"No, hey, we'll make a new path."
What if there's people in there?
Joey!
"Be careful, sweetie."
"Ronnie, I'm Cynthia."
I'm always careful!
Yes!
Okay.
Okay.
Get in there.
"You,re leaving fingerprints!"
I don't know what you're doing...
You know...
What's going on?
"That should do it, right?"
What?
You gotta show us the house.
It's just over that hill.
It's just the one house.
You can't miss it.
You came all the way here.
You should see it through.
"Don't touch me, I gotta go!"
Where do you think you're going?
I said let go!
Shit...
Hey!
Mister.
Mister?
Mister?
You all right?
You fucking bastards.
We're sorry.
Fuck off.
I'm gonna get your asses sacked.
You just wait.
"We're real sorry, okay?"
Fuck you.
You deserve to get scorched by lightning.
Where are you going?
You got hit by lightning.
Hey!
What's the point of taking all those health tonics-
if it's lightning that kills you?
Yeah.
Yes!
What a world!
"It's hard to believe, isn't it?"
I jump off a bridge.
I don't die.
Go figure.
And you  being so smart.
That must be a real comfort to you at a time like this.
- Jimmy.
- Shut up!
Shut your fucking mouth!
I loved you.
You're my brother and you betrayed me for him.
You knew I was the best cop!
Say it!
- Who's the best cop?
- Jimmy was the best cop!
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.
"Tommy, let's have a drink."
Me and you.
Just like the old days.
Remember?
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
What's the matter?
"You're a drunk, aren't you?"
Drink it!
Are you too proud to drink with a dead man?
Maybe I should drink with your little dove.
Hey.
"- Leave her alone, Jimmy."
You could still bleed out.
"Emerson, lie to a girl, will you?"
- Bite down.
- I think it's starting to hurt.
Bite.
That was bizarre.
Emerson!
Yeah.
I thought you left me.
How long was I out?
Little while.
Not long.
We were ambushed.
Yeah.
"So, what?"
What?
They wanted to stop the broadcasts?
You know as much as I do.
"Yeah, but we didn't do anything wrong."
Right?
We were ambushed.
Sit back down.
All the audio files are there.
We had nothing to do with it.
So...
They can't blame us for anything.
Why are you looking at me like that?
- We're fine.
We were ambushed.
- Calm down.
I am calm.
But what are we gonna do next?
Woman:
Are you done with that?
He did not!
Hey.
What do you want from me?
"Dad, it's me."
I stuck out my neck for you.
Now you live up-- [sigh] All right.
What took you so long?
They had to make the shit.
"Okay, so I got yours with no onions."
How you like it.
"Dad, you at least have to take a bite of it."
I will.
You should call a doctor.
"I told you, it's just a panic attack."
You sure your mom's okay with you staying here?
"Yeah, she seemed fine."
Did you ask her?
- No.
- That's what I thought.
"Well, she's been really busy lately."
She's on the phone more than usual.
"How's your mom and, uh, and your aunt Callie?"
How are they doing?
Gross.
I don't know.
Okay?
- I don't ask.
- I don't blame you.
Can you watch anything else?
Yeah.
What's the news?
Nothing special.
Take care.
Mrs Parvin!
I'm bringing you soup.
May your wishes come true.
is she well?
Yes.
Have you finished?
"If you hear me, hold the line, I'm going to higher ground."
I'm going higher up.
Hold the line.
"If you hear me, I'm not hanging up."
I'm going to higher ground so we can talk.
"If we're cut off, call me back."
"Yes, hello..."
It's you.
I thought it was Mrs Godarzi.
I told you not to call me.
I'll call you.
Godarzi calls me about work.
So why have you brought me all the way up here?
"I'm sorry, go ahead."
Really?
When?
I can't be there.
Tell them you couldn't reach me.
How is she?
Better?
"Hello, are you well, father?"
I'm listening. I'll be home soon.
I've bought it for you. lt's red.
You can't do this.
"C'mon, I bet you enjoy this."
"C'mon, look at her."
Look at me.
Her name's Betty.
"Bet he's got a nice, big weenie."
Look at me...
"Please, look at me..."
"C'mon buddy, look at Betty."
Morons.
What the hell!
You morons.
Why don't you stop fucking around?
Weren't you taught to not bother others?
"Say something, dammit."
"Hey, man!"
Why don't you shut up?
"Don't hit us, we're just pretending!"
Pretend in the damn room!
"Manager, what're you doing?"
Shut the hell up!
I don't care!
I'm gonna quit this damn place!
You listen.
I'm gonna get a job at a nice hotel.
Then I'll pay you back.
And I'll find me a better girl!
Hey!
What's wrong?
Suzuki San?
I'm running away!
Need a bike?
Jesus!
Where did you get this?
From him?
I was trying to escape.
No thanks to you.
How hard were you trying?
"Well, where the hell were you?"
"Watch it, watch it."
- What are you doing?
- For the fire!
How the hell are we going to get out of here?
I'm working on it!
I'm working on it!
"Well, whatever you're doing, do it faster."
Ah...
Where are you going?
Through that wall.
"Just get ready to run, whatever happens to me."
What do you mean by that?
Indy!
Damn it!
Don't you leave me down here by myself!
Indy!
Here we go!
Get ready!
"Indy, the torch is going out!"
Indy?
Marion!
Look.
Look.
They're going to fly it out of here.
"When that Ark gets loaded, we're already going to be on the plane."
Me neither.
"Easy, now."
You went through the trouble to save my life.
It'd be a shame to kill me.
"You all right, Rodney?"
"Yeah, just peachy."
What the hell was that?
The retrovirus is having the opposite effect than we intended.
I guess so.
"Oh, god."
On the...
"Yeah, but..."
Ellia?
You poor girl.
You never deserved this.
I know part of you is still there.
"Ellia, please."
This isn't you.
Zaddik!
Are you all right?
Don't try to move.
It was Ellia... but it wasn't her fault.
Over here!
"Here, come on!"
"No, no, no!"
You people need to go back to the village!
It is not safe here.
Who is that?
Don't you remember me?
No... it can't be.
You were taken by the Daimos.
"No, father."
Franz is coming too.
"Yes, he'll join us this evening."
You know him and me are friends.
All right.
Then I can talk to you about Franz.
Sure.
Where is he?
Freienwalde.
Karl will drive us.
There must be lots you can tell me about Franz.
"Yeah, lots."
"He's a good fellow, if a bit of a softie."
He cried on the stairs last night.
He wants out.
He's not a criminal!
- He's starting that again?
- Not him ― me!
"You, kitten?"
I see.
Let's have a kiss.
Kiss me!
You're quite a girl!
You give me ideas!
To think he works with men like you!
Shame on you!
"Yeah, shame on me!"
Let me go or I'll scream!
Go ahead!
Scream your head off!
Here.
Think you can run home and rat on me to Franz?
"""Reinhold tried to kiss me, and I let him have it!"""
!
I told you dumbasses to shovel the walk!
Crap.
It's Dad.
He's coming for us.
We're so dead!
You get your asses out of there before that thing collapses and traps you in an icy tomb.
Stay strong.
We're untouchable in here.
Untouchable?
I'll show you untouchable!
He's shimmying!
"Oh, no!"
He's entering the snow fort!
I never thought this would happen!
Ah!
I'm stuck!
I can't move my arms!
My arms are stuck!
How are your arms stuck?
It's snow.
It's soft.
I'm wedged in!
My circulation's failing me!
I can feel it!
I'm gonna die in here!
He thinks he's dying.
Stop laughing!
Stop laughing at me right now!
Why are we hiding from this man?
Look at him.
These are my last breaths!
Linda's coming in.
"Uh, okay."
"Well, you do that."
I'm just gonna drink a lot of wine.
That guy must really know what he's doing.
"Why, because he's slurping?"
Mm...
Ugh!
"Oh, my."
Excuse me!
Hey!
Hi!
Are you some kind of an expert?
I just overheard you doing that sound...
Oh.
I'm a wine enthusiast.
Although I'm not enthused by this first flight.
Oh!
He's hysterical.
You should come taste with us.
Oh!
You can give us tips on how to get tipsy.
Sure.
"Lin, no."
I don't want to drink with that guy.
Why?
"I do, Bobby."
He's an expert.
"Well, I was looking forward to a relaxing day off."
"I wasn't even gonna talk to you that much, to be honest."
I just don't want to drink with the guy...
Hi...
"Well, what do they say?"
That I should die.
"That I'm worthless, that I'm evil, stupid."
- I'm so sorry.
- That I'm...
"No, it's, um..."
"Yeah, it's terrifying."
Do they ever say good things?
"You know, like:"
"""Your hair smells like cupcakes."""
Or:
"""I don't wanna leave you."""
"No, they never say that."
"Well, then your voices are idiots."
- What is it?
- It's a labyrinth.
"You think of a question,"
- okay?
- A question.
Mm-hm.
Something in your life that needs an answer and then you just walk the path.
And maybe you'll get an answer.
Okay.
A question.
Lucy.
- He hates you.
- This is when you die.
I can't.
I can't do this.
You're disgusting.
- I can't.
- You're disgusting.
Just stay in bed.
Leave me alone!
It's great the way you sell yourself.
Why me?
You're the one who yelled.
You can't eat up everything in the fridge.
Why not?
I bought the food.
Why do I have to sell myself anyway?
"Because you want to live here, you bum."
You're nuts.
Why don't you stay here?
Would it bother you if Marco lived here a while?
"No, why?"
He asked me.
I'd like him to stay.
"Yeah, sure."
Why not?
- What are you doing?
- What do you think?
What?
Why?
I don't want to have to sell myself.
Don't worry.
I've done it for you.
Thanks.
"But no, thanks."
Stay here!
After all the trouble I went to!
I don't want trouble!
I just want to live here!
You're nuts!
It's right here.
"Oh, here it is."
Here it is.
I feel like I'm going crazy.
- What are you doing?
- You want it?
There's the medicine.
That's why I wanna go as far away as I can.
I can't save you.
I can't watch you go do this over and over and over again.
"- Oh, no."
"No, no..."
- It's just...
I can't.
"Every time I think you're going to get better, you don't."
- It's too much.
"- No, wait."
Mommy's coming.
Mommy's coming.
"Oh, no, look, they're all over the..."
I'm gonna get them.
I'm gonna get all the pills.
I'm gonna pick them all up.
Every single one.
"I'm getting them all picked up, and then..."
And then...
And then...
"Here, you hold them for me."
"You hold them for me, honey."
That's good.
Okay.
"I'm gonna get them, and I'm gonna take all my pills."
"You are the most beautiful boy, you are the most beautiful fucker."
We want to see you fuck her.
Fuck her!
"Get him, Margaret you whore."
Do it!
Give it to me baby.
Do it!
I can't.
Come on!
You can do it!
You whore.
Do it!
Come on Margaret.
Do it!
Let's go!
What for?
Let's go!
You made me do it.
This pussy has teeth no one should fuck me ever.
"What did you do with him, Margaret?"
I can't...
So where's the body?
I don't know.
Would somebody look on the roof.
Nothing out here.
What's in the box?
Was it a magic trick?
"No, Ann, it's no magic trick, I keep dead bodies in so I can fuck 'em."
"Adrian, you should leave me alone."
You should leave me alone.
What are you talking about?
I can.
You all right?
What do you mean?
You look a bit...
I'm fine.
"Loudest club in the west, mate."
You gonna be all right?
Yeah.
I'll be fine.
"Hey, Tony..."
"Hey, Cass."
Are we going somewhere?
"Oh, yes..."
- You sure you're ready for this?
- I'm totally ready.
Isn't that sweet?
I'm sad about them.
Aren't you?
I'm fine and dandy.
Good.
We're just fine and dandy...
Come on.
You can buy me a drink.
"I think that since Sid and Michelle are together, we should do the same."
"What, go out?"
Yeah!
Get dressed up?
Go on a date?
Yeah!
"And we'd talk and eat dim sum,"
- and I'd take you home...
- And I'd walk you upstairs...
But I'd knock my head on the door frame and fall down.
The bell rang!
I'll murder that guy!
I'll murder him!
They're trying to pull a fast one!
We've been crossed!
I'll kill that tagger!
He called me a fink!
- What's he talking about?
"- Tell him, Tiny!"
Tell him!
- It looks bad!
- Yeah!
- I can see all right!
"- Okay, it's your funeral!"
"Hurry up and tell him, Tiny!"
"We ain't got much time, so listen!"
"You got to lay down, Stoker!"
- Lay down?
- It's in the bag!
There's 20 bucks extra in it for you!
Maybe 30!
- But I can stop him!
"- No, you can't, Stoker!"
This is Little Boy's fix!
He's paying us to go in the tank!
You know Little Boy if you cross him!
You gotta go down!
Go down on the first good punch!
- Take the count!
Let's get out of here!
- Yeah!
Ten seconds!
"But please, I can't accept."
What a nice pear!
"I'm Clemenza, you still have my goods?"
Did you look inside?
I'm not interested in things that don't concern me.
A friend of mine has a nice rug.
Maybe your wife would like it.
Sure she would.
But who has money for a rug?
It would be a present.
I know how to return a favor.
"Yeah, sure."
My wife would like it.
That son of a bitch!
He isn't home!
"Damn, he didn't even leave the key."
"Well, he won't mind."
Come on in.
"Hey, Vito, come on in!"
This is your friend's place?
This is a real palace.
One of the best.
"Vito, give me a hand, will you?"
"Look how pretty it is, Santino!"
Come on in.
It's all right.
Hyman's in there.
-Would you like a tuna sandwich?
"-No, thank you."
...pick up of two by Holden.
Second and eight for S.C...
-Mr.
"No one, right?"
That's where people come in.
That what people see.
"No, this is the wrong..."
It's 0-3.
That's not 0-3.
You're pretty.
You have a pretty mouth.
"All the pretty girls in the hallway, you know?"
And you can come with me.
It's good.
You look good.Who the fuck?
Who the fuck?
It's gonna be a long day.
Nadia!
I look awful.
Can we try something new?
What kind of statement would you like to make?
Something that says... don't fuck with me.
Fuck!
Shit!
Perfect.
Just sprucing up for some marathon shmoozing.
"Sorry, I'm just looking for an earring."
I think you look perfect as you are.
Very funny.
It's nice.
It suits you.
Is it new?
You don't remember?
I was wearing it the night we met.
the opera.
Your only friend is me.
"If I conk out, you're dead."
"Here's my direct line, so you can't forget it."
"Give me a lead, fast."
That gang...
I want their names first.
"Nobody knows them, I swear!"
I want news from you.
Stay in touch.
So I know you're OK.
Good seeing you again.
How'd you get that?
It's nothing.
At work.
Why not tell me what you do?
I don't want to lose you.
"You get home late, leave early."
Lots of cops live that way.
Many wind up all alone.
What are you after?
Nothing.
I just do my job.
"Get up, lazybones!"
"- Say: ""Morning, Dad""."
"- Morning, Dad."
And give him a kiss.
No school today?
Never on Wednesday.
You know that.
"Yeah, if I knew it's Wednesday."
Mom in?
Rushing as usual.
"Karen, that was worth $60,000!"
I need that money!
That's all we got!
They had a search warrant!
That's all the money we had!
I was depending on that!
Why did you do that?
I had to!
They were going to find it!
-They wouldn't have found it!
-They would have!
I swear!
They would've found it!
Why did you do that?
-They would have found it.
-Why did you do that?
"Oh, my God!"
-l had to do it.
"-Oh, my God!"
No!
"Paulie, I'm really sorry."
I don't know what else to say.
I know I fucked up.
"Yeah, you fucked up."
But I'm all right now.
"I can be trusted now, Paulie. I'm clean."
"On my kids, I'm clean."
You looked in my eyes and lied to me.
You treated me like a fucking jerk.
Like I was never nothing to you.
"Paulie, after what you said, I couldn't come to you."
"You know, I was ashamed."
Then I'll just get back to work.
"Trevor, not yet."
I need to ask you for a UA.
Look like rain.
Radio says there's a storm on the way.
They said right.
I'd say it's already here.
You are on the first shift?
- Yeah.
- Me too.
"Funny, I never seen you before."
I've been here.
I work in the pit.
I just picked up Reynolds' shift.
Where's Reynolds?
Feds picked him up.
On warrant.
I'm Ivan.
Trevor.
"Well, I guess I'd better begin by..."
I hear that Tucker guy can be a real prick.
You got that right.
I'll see you around.
What's wrong?
I just want to lie here.
We can do that.
I'm so tired.
"You can fall asleep if you want, off the meter."
That is the problem.
I can't sleep.
Nothing helps.
Don't worry about it honey.
Mom!
Let's go.
What are we going to do?
I don't know.
Let's try this car.
"No, no, no, no, please, please, I don't want to go in that one."
"Please, Mom, please, I don't want to go in that one."
"Please, Mom, please, I don't want to go."
All right.
"Let's go down the road, see if we can get in that tourist castle we passed."
"It'll be okay, Billy."
mike'll take us home now.
[bell rings]
"Back, go on."
- Let's find a phone.
- Okay.
"Uh, operator, get me the highway patrol, please."
How do you feel?
"Aw, I'm all right."
You okay?
"Yeah, I'm okay."
[car honks]
Is that them already?
"Uh, you guys stay here."
I'm gonna go down there and talk to 'em.
- It'll be all right.
- Okay.
"How ya doing, Billy?"
Okay.
"[woman] Mike, what's the matter?"
"Mike, tell me what's wrong?"
[woman screams]
Let's get you outta here.
- You good?
-Yeah.
(COCKS GUN)
Stop.
Let him go.
"Wait, you're not gonna shoot me?"
"Once a stiff, always a stiff."
(GUNFIRE)
Go!
"Four, how did you get past security?"
FOUR:
You know me.
Scary boyfriend skills.
What is it?
You weren't there.
You didn't even hear that.
"Tris, we need to leave now, all right?"
"I'm sorry, Four."
What?
I'm sorry I didn't tell you that I was gonna go.
I wanted to say goodbye and I just didn't know how.
I didn't know how.
What are you talking about?
So even though I didn't get to say it in real life at least I get to say it now.
Even if it is just in the sim.
"Tris, we're not in a sim."
Don't you think I'd know if I was in a sim?
"Four, you're not in a sim."
You are the sim.
"Wait, wait."
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
- R-Right.
Turn the right tap.
- He's messing with you!
It's up to Chris.
He's saying left so that you'll pick right.
Maybe it's because I don't wanna hurt Gemma.
You don't care who you hurt.
One.
Left.
- I choose the left tap.
- Left tap turning on.
"Good call, Chris."
"Babe, babe, I'm sorry."
"I'm sorry, babe, he made me choose."
I suppose a date's out of the question now.
I'm so sorry.
"He made me choose, all right?"
He just made me.
"Round, and round, and round it goes... where it stops... nobody knows."
All right.
I'll play.
Truth.
Why us?
Why you?
Why us five?
Why did you choose us?
A photograph by Felix's bed.
Five faces scratched out.
- Your faces.
- That doesn't prove anything.
"- Fucking hell, a photograph."
- It was good enough for Felix... it's good enough for me.
Let's go.
"Shiv, we have met before."
In our past life.
What?
I was a princess and you were a warrior.
And we were in love.
What...what...what...
Zak killed you to make me his.
And the same thing is going to repeat again.
"Shiv, are you getting me?"
You lost your life because of me.
"Shiv, we can't be together anymore."
Just...just...just a second.
One second.
"Just give me a second, okay?"
- Listen to me.
"- Just a second, okay?"
Very important.
You nitwit!
Where is your Hidimba!
That bloody old hag!
You ask why am I cussing?
She has made my life hell.
- My girlfriend has lost it.
- Shiv!
"Past life, king and queen and what not she is talking about."
I'll stab her to death if I see her.
Let her know.
What?
I am on the other side of the island.
Wait a second.
Hey!
Yeah.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
But I can't work like this.
"So, you're going to have to choose."
All right.
Then I guess I quit.
Thank God.
"Well, call the station manager, and tell him to find somebody else."
"No, I quit you."
I quit us.
"Monk, stop crying."
I don't know where she is.
It's going to be okay.
No.
"No, I can't, Monk."
I'm at the gym.
"No, you don't want to come down here."
Believe me.
There are naked people here.
Look.
I tell you what.
I've got to work late tonight.
Why don't you come by the office?
Good.
Okay.
See you then.
"Hello, everybody."
I'm Natalie Teeger.
Who's ready to make lotto history?
Our super jackpot is worth $212 million.
Why did I make her choose?
Of course she'd choose to leave.
Why do you ask?
Might she remember?
Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
She's going to be well?
"Karl, if you put this in Regan's bedroom, I want you to tell me."
"Now, did you?"
"No, not me."
I didn't.
This was under Regan's pillow.
Did you put it there?
"Of course, I didn't."
I didn't put it.
"Excuse me, madam."
What?
-A man to see you.
-What man?
You're a very nice lady.
-Thank you.
-You're a nice man.
I'll come back when she's feeling better.
"No, she was heavily sedated."
It's serious?
"Yes, I'm afraid it is."
May I ask...?
We still don't know.
Watch out for drafts.
"A draft in the fall, when the house is hot, is a magic carpet for bacteria."
"Excuse me, madam."
Anything else?
"No, Karl, we're fine."
Thank you.
It's all right.
Does Kim know about this?
Yeah.
From you?
I haven't had a chance to talk to her myself yet.
"You square this with her, Chase, you understand me?"
Just make that right.
And get back to me as soon as Nina gives you anything.
I will.
Are we up yet?
Yep.
"Video's piped in, voice analysis, vitals, transcription."
- We're all set.
"- Nick, do you copy?"
"- Yeah, I read you."
- We're ready to go.
"All right, recording to hard drive now."
"So, Tony's doing this?"
Yeah.
Is that going to be weird for you?
What do you mean?
Didn't-didn't he and Nina go out?
Yeah.
We set?
Yeah.
All right.
I want you to do a hi-res on her eyes.
She's tired.
We might be able to pick up a tell.
Okay.
"So, we all right?"
Yeah.
We're fine.
"Look man, you don't have to be nice to me cause I'm going out with Haley, okay?"
I'm not.
Team sucks on a day without you man.
Ask Whitey.
I'm trying to avoid him.
That's cool.
Do what you got to do.
Usually do.
Am I hallucinating?
Did I just see you talking to Lucas?
"No, he was trying to talk to me."
The whole nice guy thing's wearing kind of thin.
You want to walk to English?
"Actually, I think I'm gonna cut out of here a little bit early."
Wanna join me?
Are you serious?
"Yeah, why not?"
You up for it?
"I can't, Nathan."
Alright.
"Well, look, I gotta get out of here so I'll catch you later."
Okay.
You know what?
Catch me now.
- Oh My God!
"- Nice, huh?"
"So, are we trying to get killed?"
"I told you, my dad's in Charlotte, it's okay."
I've never seen you like this.
Now you have.
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.
Let's get a drink.
Thanks.
Excuse me.
This came for you earlier.
And your wife called.
She said to call her back.
What's wrong?
A guy wants to see you.
He's drunk and he has a shotgun.
Who are you guys?
We're police.
We heard you wanted to see us.
Put down the shotgun.
"No, you guys aren't cops."
We don't sleep in uniform.
Put that down.
- Wanna see my badge?
- Stay back.
I'll show you my badge and you put down the shotgun.
It's not loaded.
I only wanted to talk.
I'm sorry.
Beatriz was my girlfriend.
He killed her.
He killed Adela too.
He chops them up and dumps them in the river.
That's why they only found the foot.
What foot?
It was her shoe.
I gave it to her.
She said she was coming back.
Back from where?
"You know, even when they're all grown-up,"
"people say to their kids,"
"""You were always my little boy."""
You really were.
Maybe we... we were blessed that...
Please don't go.
Please don't leave me.
I can't do this on my own.
"Dad, I'm scared."
What's gonna happen?
I don't know.
"Oh, God, Adam."
I don't know.
Dad?
Nina!
Nina!
"- It's OK, it's OK."
"All right, all right."
- What does he need?
"I'm sorry, Adam."
I think he knew it was gonna happen.
That's why he came back to Wales.
He wanted to die here.
- This is it.
I'm on my own.
"- Oh, no, you're not."
You and Nina are just dealing with a problem.
That's all I am to you.
"Look, I can't pretend to know how you're feeling, cos personally I haven't been through it."
I know.
You're just a kid.
"Yeah, but, whatever you're feeling... you can tell me, I'll listen."
Now tell me his name.
- Are you interrogating him?
"- Yes, I am."
Don't you dare!
He's dying!
He's got blood in his lungs and they're filling up and there's fuck all in here that I can use to stop it.
I can still hear all this.
"Okay, Dad."
Just relax.
Just keep calm.
Fine.
"Clare, what do you need?"
Okay.
I need something sharp to stab into his chest to release the pressure.
- That's fine.
I have a knife.
- That's no good.
"- A valve, I need a valve."
- I've got a pen in my back pocket.
"- Yes, a pen."
A pen will work.
- Here.
Okay?
Yes.
Perfect.
"Take that bit out, then slice off the end."
"All right, Dad, just keep breathing for me."
That's right...
I've got you...
I've got you...
- Are you good?
- All right.
"Marcia's a very pretty girl, isn't she?"
Oui.
"Yes, sir."
"That's what frightens you, isn't it?"
"Why no, sir, I..."
You're afraid I'll become interested in Marcia.
"Why well, if you..."
If you want to...
What?
!
What?
!
You're not very clear.
"Well, sir, I..."
Oh.
"Oh, you poor child."
"I'm such a tease, aren't I?"
Such a tease.
"Yes, sir."
What a lucky man I am to be loved this way.
But supposing I did have to leave you for a while?
"Leave, sir?"
When?
"I'm not saying when, I said ""suppose."""
Well...
Supposing I had to take a trip from time to time?
You...
You mean... soon?
"Well, now, I don't know."
"Oh, you mustn't look so worried."
"It won't be for a long, long time."
"Oh, I see."
"Blair, we gotta help her."
"We're gonna help her, but we can't help anyone until we get a signal."
It's gonna take two seconds to get our-
- Both of you stop.
Blair's right.
"Connor, shut up."
I'll help her.
Riley and I got this.
"Hey, what?"
No.
Right?
Fuck it.
Let's do it.
We're staying together.
Just go find a signal.
Go.
"We'll go, we'll go."
No.
Wait.
The door.
Spirits.
"Oh, no no no."
Connor!
Yeah.
Are you okay?
"Yeah, we're fine."
"Look, we're gonna, we're gonna figure out how to get her out of that thing, then we'll find a way out."
"Just, find a signal."
"No, we're not leaving you."
"Blair, just go find a signal, okay."
"We gotta go, we gotta go."
We'll be back.
"John, listen..."
I've never done what you do.
I know.
Just ask him for the time.
"Or a light, or whatever."
You can do that.
I'll do the rest.
Do you want some fudge?
I've eaten tonnes.
I'd better save some for Manuela.
You OK?
I feel a bit...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Can you...stop the car.
Stop the car.
"""It's done."""
Are either of the kid's fathers gonna turn up to this dance of theirs?
Abby's dad sends money in a card each birthday.
"Rob's dad, nothing at all."
I could come if you want.
To the dance.
They'd love that.
"They think you're great, you know?"
Rob said you were cool.
Got some catching up to do.
"Like you said, you're not going anywhere, right?"
"They're good kids, Jess."
You've done a brilliant job with them.
I can't find my shoe anywhere.
I'll need it for the beach.
"'This is freedom, isn't it?"
- I feel weird.
- I can't breathe.
- Did you take something?
- Franz gave me a pill.
- Simon's with your sister.
In the VIP Lounge.
You can't allow that.
"- Go home, Luise."
- You can't make me.
Mum will freak if she hears you came here on a school night.
Go home.
- I hate you.
- Go home.
And you come with me.
Move over.
- Where are you going?
- For a wash.
- Will you be back?
- Maybe.
You bastard!
She's my little sister!
Why did you do that magazine?
- Can't you just forget it?
- It was so way out of line.
- I don't regret it.
- So you'd do it again?
- If I have to.
- I don't need shit like this.
Keep your hands off Luise.
"Simon, you mustn't go."
- Please don't be too rough.
- Haven't you done it before?
I will finish it.
"But it isn't, see?"
I'm finishing it.
Hello Jerd.
This is Je speaking.
Yes.
Are you free now?
I've got a job for you.
It's for Adidas.
"You can, right?"
So you're free?
Okay.
Where are you now?
"Okay, I will send you the file."
Bye.
Yoon.
Save the file for me now.
"No, I won't."
Yoon.
No.
This isn't the time to be afraid of losing a job.
Have you lost it man?
I'm not afraid.
"You are not afraid, huh?"
What do you call this?
I said I'll send the rest tomorrow morning.
You have another half.
You won't make it in time.
You taught me that freelance work is all about being responsible.
"If you can't make it, don't take the job, remember?"
But I will finish in time.
Is this in time?
But it's not good.
There you are.
I had a dream about you.
Yeah?
Hope a good one.
"There was some kind of... disaster... nuclear, maybe, I don't know."
[muttering]
Seemed like the whole world was burned.
And I was looking for you.
"I couldn't find you, and I was..."
I was calling your name.
So not a good one.
You've been working too hard.
So why don't we stay in bed all day?
Order some food in.
Watch movies.
What?
What is it?
It's Sunday.
Yeah.
I know what day it is.
"Yeah, it's Marius' deadline."
Yeah.
"I know that, too."
"If you ruin Eddie's hands, you'll never get a chance to expose Mukherjee."
So you want me to give Eddie a pass.
Yeah.
"Hey, tell me something."
Yeah.
"I need to ask you something, and I want you to be honest with me."
Of course.
Do you still care about Marius?
No.
I don't know what it is.
Do you?
Not yet.
Now we are done here.
I apologize again.
For what?
Keeping me waiting or lying to me?
Both.
Good evening.
Sabine will show you out.
"Picked the wrong House to crash, Ma'am."
Chthon is pretty picky.
I was looking for my daughter.
She was there.
"A lot of people pass through them, Ma'am."
What's that?
An extract of garlic.
I'd say this is gonna hurt a little but I'd be lying.
I've always hated garlic.
This will be the last time you'll be able to smell it.
I promise.
"Oh my god, mom!"
What are you doing?
Get out of the way.
"You're gonna have to kill me first, you son of a bitch."
Blade.
Krista?
"Mum, we're gonna get you out of here."
"I'm a little busy, sweetheart."
"Mom, look at me!"
You've to come with me now!
I don't repeat things.
"And I hope I don't offend you, but I don't respect Korean men too much."
There are some good men though.
"Yeah, I guess."
Take care of your leg.
Hope your script comes out great.
I'm sure you'll do well.
I really like you.
"Yes, good-bye."
Moonsook.
Thank you.
It was under the bed.
"Oh, really?"
When are you going home?
The day after tomorrow.
How about you?
I'm going now.
Hope you think things over well.
"Yes, I will."
I'll be going.
Good-bye.
My car...
We'll push it for you.
"- We'll push, you drive."
"- So I have to get in, right?"
Here we go.
Steer to the left a bit.
- Like this?
- Left.
"Left, like this?"
I think it's getting out!
- Thank you so much.
I wouldn't hurt you.
I'm sorry.
Are you expecting somebody?
No.
Can I talk to my sister for a minute?
It's okay.
I had this whole speech planned. so-- wait wait.
Just-- what I'm trying to say is that l-- but it wasn't for lack of trying.
Dad split... and Mom passed away.
And we got stuck with Rod.
And... you know?
I'm not your responsibility anymore.
I know that.
That's what I came here to say.
I know you're not a little girl anymore.
And... you-- you grew up to be this really beautiful woman.
And you deserve better.
And I'm gonna have to learn to let you go. but I'm gonna try.
okay?
Thank you.
Thank you.
He's not such a bad guy.
I know.
He's not.
I'm gonna go.
Are you okay?
it was my mom's ring.
I didn't know he had it.
I'm gonna be leaving.
I want you to come with me.
Of course.
- Yeah?
Honey!
Where you going?
I have to help them.
"No, no no."
"The cops are gonna be here any second, and you're two strikes."
"Okay, you're right, you're right."
"They're gonna be here, I'm gonna buy them some time."
"Well, what about us?"
"Take the van, go down the street, wait for me there."
"No, that's not the plan."
"Fuck the plan, Blair, okay."
He's gonna kill them.
How could you?
I loved you!
Hey.
Hey you.
This is the police.
"All right, freeze."
Fuck face.
"We know you're up there, all right?"
"We want you to come out, and reach for the sky, or..."
I will shoot you in the face.
Oh shit.
Shit.
"Shit, shit."
Hey!
Police!
"Freeze, fuck face!"
Hands in the air.
Stop.
Reach for the sky or I will shoot you in the face.
"What do you know about me, boy?"
We watched it for two weeks.
Oh God.
Oh God.
You're lying to me.
You have to be lying.
What?
"I don't know anything about robbing, but I do know that two weeks is not enough time."
"No, two weeks is the perfect amount of time."
It's not enough time.
That's more than enough time.
"Yeah, so much time."
Oh my God.
We can do a lot in two weeks.
Plenty of time.
An eternity.
"Hey, you know what?"
"My driver and our lookout, they're calling the cops right now, so you're gonna be okay."
Everything's over.
Now we just all need to sit tight.
What?
No.
"No, no no no."
"No, we can't do that."
He's gonna be back here.
He's gonna kill us.
You don't understand.
Who?
Him.
He's not right in the head.
He did things to me.
You want a tissue?
Never mind.
You have a slow leak.
"Guido, he fix."
You make-a such a nice new road.
You come to my shop.
Luigi take-a good care of you.
Even though you not a Ferrari.
"You buy four tires, I give you a full-a size spare"
- absolutely free!
"- Look, I get all my tires for free."
"I like your style, eh?"
You drive the hard bargain.
OK.
Luigi make you a new deal.
"You buy one tire, I give you three for free!"
"Oh, would you look at that?"
"Ramone, Ramone!"
Then Luigi make you a new new deal.
"No, no, no, no."
Deal me out.
Pass.
"No, thank you."
"- No, no, no, no."
No.
- This is it.
My last offer.
"You buy one tire, I give you seven-a snow tires for free!"
Done.
"You interested, you call me."
You know where I am.
Ah!
Stop!
Let me...
You're a beautiful girl.
You know that?
That's what they love around here.
They need girls like you.
"And with me in your corner, you're in like Flynn."
"Thanks a lot for helping, really."
Good.
That's nice.
That's what I like to hear.
I like to be thanked.
No.
"I'm sorry, I don't want to."
Come on.
Get off me.
Don't play hard to get.
Get away.
Get off me!
I don't mind if you don't.
Get back.
Get away!
"Come on, we're gonna trade favors."
Tit for tat.
"You wash my back, I'll wash yours."
Definitely not a funny way to die.
Crockett I though!
t you were off.
Since when has that mattered?
Who's in the bag?
Morty Price.
The comic?
He got a nice slice from a steak knife.
Definitely not a funny way to die.
"You're not embarrassed, are you?"
Of course not.
"I just thought you were working, that's all."
I took off.
For this?
Yeah.
Didn't your father ever teach you how to tie a tie?
"No, he didn't."
You know...
I didn't mean to make you do anything
You didn't want to do.
I'm chillin' yo.
"Oh shit, my dude..."
That's a nigga right there.
"No gas, no gas!"
Oh!
You just gonna stand there?
You're not gonna say anything?
"Yo, what you want me to say, yo?"
It ain't like they lying.
"You know, you're fucked up."
Yo.
"Yo, you ain't my girl."
"You need to chill the fuck out, a'ight?"
"Oh, so I'm good enough for you to fuck"
"And for me to suck your dick,"
But I'm not your girl?
"Well, then fuck you..."
fuck you!
"Yo, you good?"
"I'm good, yo."
"Wait, Chris."
"That's a shame, Frankie."
Lot of unanswered questions.
You want your fight?
You got your fight.
"You and me, right now."
"- Well, I..."
No.
- What?
"Daddy, you can beat him."
Come on.
- You're next.
- It'll be like the old days.
I will kill you.
I will knock your nose off your face.
"You wanna knock something, you knock it off of me."
- That's right.
"- All right, you got a fight."
"Greg, get my gloves."
"- I'm sorry, bro."
"- Yeah, well, sorry's not gonna get our money back."
- He was so fast.
- You should have moved around a little more and tired him out.
- We have nothing.
- I don't know what to say.
- I gave it my best.
- Yeah.
You know what?
Your best wasn't good enough.
"- Hey, you have the time?"
"- Aw, not you again."
We don't have any money.
We just lost it all.
Four years.
Oh?
"Killed his girlfriend, Ida, while on the booze."
Not bad for a beginner.
Eats her fill and then she's off.
- What did he come looking for?
- Me!
Do I owe you?
I'll pay you back.
So you were in the can?
"- Yeah, but that's over."
- You're quite a guy.
I'm a street vendor now:
"Matches, newspapers, suspenders."
You can't make money that way.
The main thing is to go straight.
Am I right?
- You're right.
What's your name?
Reinhold.
"See ya, Reinhold."
"You used to be my gal, Cilly."
Not anymore.
Maybe we can be friends again.
Get the fat guy for us.
We can use him.
He's done time in Tegel.
The two new guys are lightweights.
We're gonna get that guy.
- Looks real solid.
- Yeah.
And not too bright.
I can see it now.
It's gonna be great.
Lex.
It's Gina.
Please call me back.
I found who you've been searching for.
I know who the traveler is.
"After the funeral, I plan on taking some time off."
Get the jet ready.
Zurich.
You can't run away.
"No matter where you go, I'll always be there."
You can't get rid of me.
You need my help.
There's still good inside you.
I know it.
I don't want your help.
Don't go to Zurich.
I'm going.
I have to.
Dad was right.
"If you open the box, it will destroy you."
It's all I have left.
It's not true.
You still have me.
I'm done listening to you.
You make me weak.
Long night.
It's good to see the sun again.
It's too bad Lionel's not here to see it.
Lex closed the funeral to any and all guests.
"In other words, Lex is the only one invited."
There are a lot here.
- What's after that?
- Nothing.
I know what there is.
Nothing.
- Nothing?
- There's a road near the tree.
I'll tell you what there is.
"""Near hhe hree is a wooded lane, greener hhan hhe dreams of God."""
What's after the tree?
Read the address.
"It says a tall, single tree."
There's a lot on this hillside.
is it very tall?
"Yes, it says it's very tall."
It must be different from the others then.
The single tree?
There are so many.
They're all on the hill.
That's what it says here.
I don't think this will get us anywhere.
There it is.
"There, look, a single tree!"
- Where?
- Up there.
I see it...
What a big tree!
Look at it.
He was right.
"Jahan, take a look."
Where?
"Too late now, you'll have to look up through the roof but you won't see it."
Hi Zeke.
Hello young lovers.
I got to get back to class.
See you back in class...
Striktly hands of Bro.
"Zeke, I wouldn't do that."
She's just my friend.
You wouldn't?
That's what best-buds do don't they?
Yeah!
I can think about a dozen times...
-
I have been the best friend you ever have.
"Saved your ass, lie for you, stolen for you."
"Zeke, I am telling you."
Nothing is going on.
So we are on the same page?
Yeah.
"Ok, come on, let's hang out."
I steal 6 packs of beer how does that sound?
"Tonight, me and you we are going to the movies."
Leo is in a new movie.
You got to see it.
"I can't, I have to work tonight."
Why do you work in that awful place?
"I need the money, I have to save up to college."
"Alright, whatever."
I ask Mimi to go with me.
"Ok, see you later."
Bye!
All hands on deck.
Jake?
Get 'em!

"Let go, you!"
"Oh, you!"
You bully you!
You great big brute.!
You bully you.!
You brute.!
"Let go of me, you brute.!"
Let go of me.!
- No.
Come on.
- Let go of me!
Really!
You men cover the back.
You come with me.
You're under arrest!
"- Marjorie, are you all right?"
"- Yes, I think so."
But where have you been?
Locked in a garage.
Had to dig my way out.
I got here as soon as I got the police.
How are you holding up?
Good.
Come on.
Let's go.
Hello?
- Jane!
- Mum...
We're here now.
Shh.
"Let's pack up your things, and we'll drive you home."
"Erm... no, it's all right."
I want to stay here.
- Erm...
- OK.
- OK.
- I'll be fine.
I promise.
"Would you both stay, just for a little bit?"
Of course we will.
As long as you need us to.
What do you want?
I wanted to return this to you... make sure you got it.
It was David's.
One of the lads at the station was meant to get it back to you a couple of weeks ago.
He forgot.
Can't trust men to get anything right.
Ta.
Take care of yourself.
"One glowing review, you're the Sheriff of Hackney?"
It's just...
It's just what?
"You don't want to spend the rest of your life in uniform, like me?"
"- Let's get him out, okay?"
"- Please, please, get me out of here!"
It's gonna be a piece of cake.
When I was a kid I used to build....
- I used to build forts in these tunnels.
- You did?
Yeah.
"You gotta watch, because when it rains, the water comes up really quick."
"Joey, listen to me."
You go find a phone.
You call 911.
You tell them to send a rescue squad.
"All right, Joey?"
Go!
Go!
"- Well, where's he going?"
"- Well, this grate is locked."
- I'm gonna need a little help.
- But you said you could do it.
- What's that light down there?
- I don't know.
- I'm gonna check it out.
- Don't leave!
- I'll be right back.
- Wait.
Just don't!
"Ben, listen to me."
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I promise you that.
"But you gotta do me a favor, okay?"
You gotta trust me.
Can you do that?
Just think about it.
"Think about it, boys!"
All right.
I'm hitting it.
You dudes give up that easy?
I'm not a cop.
Then lift your shirt.
Show me you're not wearing a wire.
"All right, you know what?"
Just to show you you're being an asshole.
I'm blinded by white.
Douchebag.
Come on.
I was joking.
Come on.
Don't walk away angry.
Sit down.
Come on.
"I mean, what are you complaing about?"
"You got abs, man."
Kinda.
"Whatever, dude."
I'm not even sure I want to buy anymore.
I think you turned me off to the whole thing.
Come on.
Don't be like that.
"I just need you to prove it, you know?"
Prove you're not a cop.
How the hell am I supposed to do that?
I don't know.
I got it.
Go over there and punch that dude right in the face.
"- Oh, you don't?"
- No.
"Well, how would you say it?"
I don't know.
I'd call her up and ask her to a dance.
Or a movie?
"Yeah, or a movie and we'd go and get something to eat."
Or drink?
"No, not any girl I'd propose to."
"Oh, I see."
"Well, go on."
"Well, then when the time came, I guess I'd hold her hand."
You mean like this?
Yeah.
Then what would you say?
I'd say:
"""Betty, I'm crazy about you."
"Will you marry me?"""
"Well, let me think."
"Yes, Ed, I guess I will."
"- Well, then we're engaged."
- I think that's what they call it.
Oh.
"- It's swell, isn't it?"
- Yeah.
"Hey, what will your mother say?"
"She'll probably say, ""Thank, heavens. """
- Come on.
Let's get out of here.
- Okay.
How you like the sodas?
"- Okay, Nick, take it out of there."
I'm tired.
I've got to do something.
Come on!
Let's go and take care of this.
"Tom, I can't find Franz."
"Please give him my best regards, and give him this."
This is the video footage.
I've decided not to do the project.
He'll be upset then.
"I'm sorry, but I think it's for the best."
I'm upset too.
Didn't you like the mask?
The mask was great.
I'm not so certain.
It's not your fault.
Who's fault is it then?
Certainly it's not yours.
Take care Tom.
I've been waiting for you.
I had the late shift.
Now I've got no time.
What are you doing?
Shopping free of charge
Help!
Do you live here now?
You came here to ask me that?
Something has happened.
What?
A supermarket was held up.
A woman was shot.
Is he shoplifting now?
What are you up to there?
Look at this.
4 more break-ins on casino boulevard.
It's getting so you can't walk out the door anymore.
"Well, you can walk out the door."
You just can't go left.
That's not the point.
"A man should be able to walk out his front door, turn right, turn left, or walk right out into the street if he wants to."
"Don't make me lock you in the house, dad, ok?"
"Well, hello."
Ooh.
That shirt looks sexy on you.
Does it?
"I, uh, hadn't noticed."
"Hi, I'm Doug."
I'm a pisces.
I like walks in the rain and bags of pork rinds.
"Work it, baby."
Work it.
"I got the trash, babe."
That'll be our deal.
"Every time you buy me a shirt, I take out the trash."
"Oh, that's ok, honey."
I got it.
I got it.
"No, really."
It's fine.
What--what is this?
Barry's big and tall shop?
What?
"Oh, that's trash, baby."
You got my shirt at the big and tall shop?
Did I?
"Go, I'll pay you later."
I can't start the day... with debts.
So what do you want?
I also start the day with debts...
"What am I working for, then?"
I don't give a damn.
Beat it!
I have no money.
What do you want?
Come back later!
"Just think a bit, I have to earn a living."
"Go on, beat it!"
I won't flee...
"Hi, Korotoumou."
You could wait until the morning is over.
Korotoumou... do you have my money?
Don't insult me!
- Aren't you a bitch!
"- Yes, I am."
"I have your money, but I won't pay you."
You'll pay me.
Is the Mecca wall painted... with your shit?
And yours?
Fucking bitch!
You old whore!
Calm down!
Have you no shame?
"Traoré, breakfast is ready."
What's the matter?
I don't feel like talking.
I'm worried.
- You know them well.
who cares?
OK.
You're ugly.
You're the ugliest woman of Earth.
Everyone knows it but me.
To me.
You're beautiful.
You don't know me.
When will I know you?
Enough.
I mean...
In two weeks?
A year?
Ten years?
How much time does one have to fall in love?
You're not in love with me.
You just want to leave your apartment.
No.
I don't want to leave.
You don't want to and yet you're suffocating.
So you fall in love with the first woman who cries in front of you.
You want her to get you out.
- No.
I'm fine here.
Not me.
I'm not buying it.
You're not even handicapped.
But I am.
You revel in your phobias.
Of course.
I revel in them.
That's what phobias are.
Don't worry.
I stuck a bloody Band-Aid in it before we left.
Holy crap.
Look at that!
Cool!
A diving board!
Oh... my...
God.
This is the greatest thing ever.
And someone just dumped it here for us to find.
We've got to take it home!
What are we gonna do with it?
I don't know.
But...
look at it!
It's... it's got the... and it's... up and... and bounce and... and bounce!
He's right.
We need it.
"One, two, three... go!"
"One, two, three... go!"
"One, two, three, go!"
"One, two, three, go!"
"Aah, Jamie, this is ridiculous!"
"You'll eat dead bugs out of the zapper, for God's sake, why won't you eat your peas?"
You love peas!
Come on.
This is name-brand stuff.
It's three times the price of the food I eat!
"If you want to breathe, you have to open your mouth."
See?
There's no reason for...
"Now you're just going to have to eat some eyebrow, too."
Do you wanna leave ?
I like this place.
It's been a long time since we came here.
Your mother is gonna wait.
It was at least a year and a half ago.
"I wanted to take a book with me, and I forgot."
It was quite sunny !
You had to insist to bring me here.
As usual I dithered.
Aferwards I was happy.
Things were never the same after that.
"Try to sleep now, sweet heart."
Was it Francois who's just called ?
"Yes, he is on the way."
You didn't tell him.
No.
I don't want him to worry.
It's bad enough with you being upset.
This should be him.
Mom ?
Yes sweet heart ?
How do I look ?
Great.
Hi François !
Everything's alright ?
Yes !
How is he ?
Did he sleep ?
No even if he's really quite exhausted.
"He can't sleep, can he ?"
And he keeps asking about you.
"I go see him, and then I will make us dinner."
So you didn't take the bedtime pills?
I did.
But I still couldn't sleep.
That's odd.
So how are you today?
Feeling better?
Let's have a look.
C'mon.
This side.
They're all dry.
Let me check your neck.
Wow they are all gone.
Lift up your t-shirt.
"So there aren't anywhere else, right?"
All gone.
So you are cured.
"Yes, I am."
Why you sound like you knew it already?
Oh that's why you didn't wear a jacket.
"You know if you're all better, you didn't have to come."
Done.
Congrats.
So next month we won't see each other anymore.
"It's all good, doc."
Thanks a lot.
Hey...
You are okay.
It's all good.
You understand.
It's all good.
"Before you went you knew this would happen, right?"
So what's wrong with you now?
"Yeah, but my dad was only 12."
"Well, if I was older, do you think that I would make a very good husband?"
"If you were older, I think you'd make a wonderful husband."
I'll be back when I'm 25.
Will you wait?
That's a long time to wait.
It won't be as long as you think.
Now don't move.
I'll be right back.
Nancy?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What are we fightin' about?
I don't know.
I guess I do.
I'm jealous.
Of Wilbur?
He's only 14 years old.
He is?
"Well, how old did you think he was?"
"Oh, much older."
"I mean, he's very mature for 14."
I thought he was at least 15.
"Oh, Bob, you're so silly."
(CLEARING THROAT)
Now let's see.
"""Nancy, I know I'm not very much,"""
"""but I am old enough."""
"""And I couldn't love you any more if I were 100 years old."""
"No, that's no good."
"""Nancy, honey, if you marry me,"""
"""I'll be the happiest, luckiest man in the whole world."""
Mama!
Calm down.
This was a bad idea.
Hop out.
"Good for you, Jay."
It has to be when he is ready.
- Nope.
He's driving.
- What?
- What?
I-I can't.
- You're doing it now.
"Jesús, take the wheel."
He's terrified to be in the back.
Now you're gonna put him in the front seat so that he can kill all of us?
!
Can you not make this fear worse?
I watched Dede coddle Mitchell when he was afraid of the dark.
"Till he was seven, he'd only blink one eye at a time..."
Gave a lot of girls a very wrong idea.
"Manny, you don't want to do this right?"
"No, I really don't."
"Okay, papi, you know what?"
Let's switch.
I'm going to drive.
"I've got a bombshell, mom."
"Ay, papi, thank you, but this is a very weird thing to say when we're in this position."
"No, I've decided I'm never driving."
Uh... unh-unh-unh-unh!
No way.
You there.
You there.
"- Tennison, are you hurt?"
- No.
No.
It's...
It's not my blood.
It's...
It's David Bentley's.
He's dead.
Let's get you to the station and get you cleaned up.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
"We'll get you in the car, all right?"
"Take her to the station, OK?"
When are you coming back?
I don't think I am.
What?
"Do you know what my mum said to me, when I was joining the force?"
No doubt the same as mine.
That you were mad.
She said I'd end up dead.
And you think this has proved her right?
"Kath, you can't give up."
You've got a shot at joining CID.
I'd give my right arm to be in your shoes.
"It's not giving up, accepting your limitations."
I need someone to look up to.
I'm not much of a role model.
You're not if you quit.
Funeral's tomorrow.
So surreal.
He was standing right in front of me.
You're the one who makes me feel I've made a flop out of this.
"I'm telling you, the only one."
"Say, Jim, that's not bad."
That's good work.
- Have you always been able to draw?
"- Yeah, a little."
Come on.
Let me see you draw me.
Come on.
Let me see if you can get my puss on paper.
Go.
Come on.
A professional tried to draw me once.
He couldn't get me.
Couldn't touch me.
"Well, you shouldn't be hard to do."
"Well, come on."
Let me see you do it.
"How do you want me, full face or sideways?"
Look over there.
You're a cinch.
"You know, the more I see it, the better I like it."
The pan or the picture?
"Oh, why, the picture, of course."
Hm.
"I'm crazy about you, baby."
"You know that, don't you?"
"- Are you, Patsy?"
- Mm-hm.
Gets worse all the time.
It's got me worried.
- Why?
"Run,run,run!"
"Go,baby!"
"Go, go, go!"
"Go to second, go to second!"
"Go, baby, go!"
"Go to third, go to third, ziggy!"
"Go, babe!"
"Run, run, run!"
Home run!
Home run!
Home run!
Slap me some skin!
"Oh, my god, you did it!"
Ah!
You cannot ruin this one.
"It's hand wash only, so make sure and tell bonnie,"
Or i guess you can tell your dad.
Maybe your dad does the laundry now.
Maybe he does.
I was thinking
"Now that you are gone a little bit,"
Maybe we could have some girlfriend time.
That'd be cool.
Are you ever coming back?
"Yeah, of course."
I'm gonna come back all the time.
I made a playlist for you.
Are you trying to take my room?
Can i?
"No, you can't."
"Maybe when i go to college, though."
We should go get pizza.
I might as well get a dog or something.
When it comes to sex.
the man has to be in charge.
In every way.
"He has to take me when he wants, where he wants."
I'm just Woman.
just a sex object for this man.
And I need that.
And I like it.
You're right.
I swear...
Seriously.
How are you getting home?
- Leave your horn here.
- I'll take it.
- Leave it here.
- I'll drop it off tomorrow.
- By bus.
I promise.
- With the graveyard shift.
I'm the Fuhrer of this party.
- I'll take it with me.
"- No, leave it here."
Leave it.
You'll bust it.
- We need it.
- You guys have no sense of reality.
Of what's real.
How will you get home?
I have to open the door first.
How will you get home?
With who?
He'll get his wheels back.
Don't worry.
Right where he left them.
He'll never press charges.
"""Beauty Salon"""
Well...
What do you know?
Don't you feel stupid?
Dangerous characters.
"Not bad, huh?"
You can't get any?
Like a little feel?
Hands up.
And fast!
"Tough luck, boys."
I'm trying out my new gun.
Is my third car stolen this year.
I'm a little fed up.
Get it?
We didn't steal it.
We just borrowed it.
"We returned it, didn't we?"
Here it is.
It never even moved.
Tell that to the cops.
Go call them.
"No, wait!"
Why bother the cops?
We didn't hurt anyone.
We just went for a ride.
Just killing time like we were hitch-hiking and you picked us up.
You weren't around.
That must have been cute as hell.
"But yeah, she lost the lisp."
"She grew into a beautiful, smart woman."
"Look, I know what Audrey did to you."
"And as far as I can see, right now, this is your chance to get back at her."
Ahem.
Didn't you say you were gonna buy me a drink?
- Is she in?
- Of course she's in.
You got to pay her tab.
Pay the tab.
Son of a bitch.
"All right, so when we get the money and I put it in the safe, I'll let you call Audrey,"
- and you can be the hero.
"- Yeah, absolutely not."
"You're not coming with me, and I'm not giving you the money."
Raven.
"Raven, it's okay."
Come here.
Come here.
Come here.
Come here.
Come here.
It's okay.
"You sure you're okay, Mia?"
Of course.
A little fall never hurt anyone.
"Uh, what's her name?"
The girl with the wild horse.
Her name is Zoe.
And she's our friend.
"Let's go, let's go."
Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my fucking head!
"Cooper, I'm gonna shut it off, okay?"
I just need to connect.
Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my head!
"Oh, my God."
Where am I?
Who are you?
I can't stop it.
I don't know who I am.
So I...
So I need to go home.
The interface has data tendrils like roots.
They've dug in deeper than they're meant to.
"Threaded through your brain, taken over whole areas, I can't stop it."
"I can't remove it, and I can't stop it."
But I...
But I don't know who I am.
I don't know...
I don't know who I am.
I don't know who I am.
I don't know.
"On behalf of Saito Game Team, I most humbly apologize."
Who are you?
What have you done to me?
- What have you done to me?
"- Put him with the others, please."
"No, no, no, no!"
"No, no, no!"
I hit something on the road.
Jimmy'll tell you.
What happened to him?
I haven't seen you in so long.
What happened to him?
"You, too."
How are you?
Why are you up so late?
"Well, he came in."
Youse came in.
I'm so happy to see him.
Go inside.
Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll make you something to eat.
-Go to sleep.
We're leaving.
-l can't.
Not while he's home.
I haven't seen him in so long.
I want to see him.
You go inside.
"This stuff is great, but it's like lead."
"Tell me, where you been?"
I haven't seen you.
You haven't called.
Where have you been?
"Mom, I been working nights."
And tonight we were out late.
We took a ride out to the country and we hit one of them deer.
That's where all the blood is from.
Jimmy told you.
"It reminds me, I need this knife."
"Larry, Kim."
- It is so nice to meet you.
- Hi.
I did sort of a half get-up there.
"- For my niece, fake niece..."
- I should've done a full stand.
I think a full get-up would've...
It's the thought that counts.
"Listen,"
I hope...
"it's kind of weird, but I'd really love for you to take a look at my reel if you wouldn't mind."
"You know, I mean, I could take a look at it."
I'm not really...
I'm not doing TV right now.
"- That's fine, it's fine."
- How you doing?
I'm doing really well.
Thank you.
How are you?
- You look fabulous by the way.
"- Oh, why thank you."
"So Anna Nicole Smith, she's got uh... some pair of knockers on her, huh?"
"They're not real though, are they?"
Huh?
- Whoa.
- Hey.
What's all... what's all that?
Look at all his gifts.
I thought you said we weren't supposed to bring a present.
He said no gifts.
I don't get it.
- Hello.
"Let's see your fingers, prune girl."
"Talk to the hand, 'cause the face ain't gonna listen."
"He asked me to come up with something new, something fresh."
You read it.
It was good.
- Yes.
- It was the funniest script we've had all year!
"Yes, it was."
So what was their problem?
"Hey, I want to hear."
"Oh, yeah?"
"I want to sing opera, but I can't, so I don't."
That downstairs is...
"Well, your dad has a high-pressure job."
What's a high-pressure job?
"It's when you don't get to do what you want and when you do, you don't have time to do it."
Do spies have high-pressure jobs?
Only when they're caught.
I'm never caught.
You're right.
You never are.
"Oh, look, a ugly water bug!"
Hey!
Caught ya.
Here she is.
Night.
Good night.
Good night.
You want me to tuck you in?
Golly can do it.
"""'The time has come,' the Walrus said."
"""To talk of many things."""
Come on.
"One, two, three!"
Wow.
That train is not moving very fast.
This window won't open.
That's why we need to get back in there.
Could pick up the pace.
You're not going fast enough.
I am too going fast enough.
No job is done until the paperwork is complete.
Stand by.
Where the hell is Rudy?
Okay.
"Oh, boy!"
"Oh, oh..."
"Oh, wow..."
It's not that bad.
You're making a big deal.
Wow.
You're making...
Come on.
It's like my grandpa.
It's not that bad.
Where the hell have you been?
Pull me up.
Hand me the chocolate and then I'll pull you up.
Hand you the chocolates?
Yeah.
And then I'll pull you up.
How do I know that once I hand you the chocolate you're not gonna just leave me out here and take the chocolate?
I wouldn't do that.
That's what I would do.
He's cute.
I know how to make him feel better.
"No, I know a better way."
Lift him up.
"Oh, goodness."
"Oh, goodness, what have you done?"
"What are you doing this time, Jimmy?"
He's still conscious?
Yes.
Hello.
You'll be fine.
You just gotta get a little bit power.
"Ladies, could you give us a little space, please?"
Thank you.
"You're a big deal, you know?"
You're not the only one wronged by Akan.
You and I want the same thing.
This might hurt a bit.
Here we go.
That's wonderful.
Now we can take you back to my lab.
"I'm Jimmy, by the way."
I realize this is very confusing for you.
But it's better if I show you at the lab.
Hello?
"Oh, thank you."
They're Here.
They must have followed you.
I can't...
I can't let them see me like this.
I can't let...
I'm sorry.
"No, stop!"
Look out for the cow!
"Come on, no, not there!"
please stop.
"No, stop!"
We can't go there yet.
people just aren't ready for you.
That was close.
"We can't go running around like that, okay?"
Look!
That would be okay to eat.
It's been there for months.
We gotta hide!
"You know, hide?"
"It's when you-- You know, when you--"
"Just get behind something, quick!"
We took him to a relative
Why'd he do it?
"I don't smell booze on him, but he's not talking."
Could be high on something.
How else could he end up like that?
What the hell happened?
"How's it going, Sergeant?"
I'm his uncle!
Let go of me!
Rotten bastard.
Couldn't he use GPS?
Why do I have to take him?
Ain't that it?
Get the wire cutters.
Pull it back.
What's that stink?
You're late!
The last 15 minutes..
"I've been a fucking roller coaster of emotions, mate."
I didn't know if I was ever gonna see you again.
So I lit some of this.
"I fired on my nerves damn you, you know?"
And there you are.
It's okay.
You've just lost power.
Come on.
"Hey, bring me some of this strong Russian shit, girls."
"Okay, now where is that ... pump?"
Where's that?
Did you get it?
Did you get the fucking...?
Yeah?
"Fuck you, no!"
This is it.
"This is it, yeah."
Okay.
"Okay, hold this, lady."
Shit.
"Okay, we gotta get this little fucker in there."
Whom I kidding with?
I'm not in condition to do this.
"I'm sorry, I'm in no condition to do this, mate."
I'm in no condition.
I'm sorry.
I'm in no condition to do this.
What's wrong with his hand?
Who is he?
Is he a robot?
I'm not dating...
I know.
I get it.
"What about you, smart guy?"
Did you really think this one through?
"Well, I have a right to display my art."
"Oh, give it up."
I'm gonna have to side with chloe on this one.
I wanted it in my show. it's my best picture.
There's a red dot on it.
Who bought it?
"oh, god. that feels weird."
Nobody bought it.
"I didn't want anyone to have it,"
"So i-i put a ""sold"" sticker on it."
Yeah.
Maybe.
Out of my way!
you!
"Oh, pooh. you're late. sorry you missed all the fun."
Oh!
not really.
I brought my own fun.
"Hello, andrea. come in early tomorrow."
Do you mind?
I want to show you your new office.
i think you're gonna like it.
"If you need to make a copy, it's super convenient."
"Okay, so you don't like practical jokes."
That's good to know. that's how a friendship grows!
Come on.
I'll walk you out.
"If she doesn't pay, it comes out of my pocket."
Why call the police?
We'll make her parents pay.
Do you really need the police?
I feel bad for her.
"What, are you willing to pay what she owes?"
"No, but..."
"She won't tell us her address, she's a runaway."
Hey!
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Hey!
He's not coming back.
"He hasn't replied yet, right?"
You were tricked.
Shut up!
He said he's not doing that anymore.
He tells that lie to everyone.
Get your hands off me!
What're you doing here?
Ow...
Let's go.
He went and fought for her.
What about you?
They must be in round two.
Take it easy.
I have to go.
"Does your husband do this to you, too?"
"No, he won't even lay a finger on me."
Sergeant Fujita must be asleep with your kid now.
Don't...

Just think.
This is our chance to get our big break.
I think a crazy plan is coming our way.
"If we can just get the song to Livi, she'll help launch my career."
I'll be rich and famous.
"And what happened to ""us""?"
"We're a band, remember?"
"Yeah, what good is fame if you don't have your friends?"
That's just it.
We'll all be famous.
As if.

"Oh, nothing."
It's just so much fun listening to you guys think you could be pop stars.

"Oh, please."
Last night was terrible.
You look good.
That's impossible at my age.
Even more now... that I'm dying.
Don't say that.
I'm dying!
"Come on Jacoba, you have to be strong!"
I don't want to!
I'm dying...
It's all because of your son.
It's a girl.
Don't you remember?
Why do you blame her?
He's a selfish person.
"When he was small, he was so quiet."
Probably he was thinking what he was going to do later.
He was really cute.
And very obedient.
You know already what happened when he grew up.
He turned out to be so ugly!
Now that we're married I can tell you...
He took away my house.
You said the house was for me.
But he came back and took it away.
So I told him I was leaving to die in other place.
Don't listen to her.
She doesn't know what she's saying.
I know what I'm saying!
Who's that?
She's a nun.
She takes care of you.
You're younger.

I don't want to get into this.
I gotta have time.
I can't get any more time.
"- Give me some fuckin' time, will you?"
- You're not gonna get it.
We found a set of works on the kid driving the sports car over there.
His girlfriend's in the back of the car.
She's dead.
- Give the car a complete toss.
- I say we keep sitting' on Boca.
"Jimmy, give it up."
Give it up.
It's all over with.
"If there was a deal, it's gone down by now."
We blew it.
We blew our warrants.
We blew our cover.
"Walter, listen."
I know the deal hasn't gone down.
I— I know it.
I can feel it.
I'm dead certain.
"Last time you were dead certain, we ended up with a dead cop."
Hey!
Hold— Hold on!
Hold on!
"Break it up, both of you!"
Will you two break it up?
Stop it now.
I sleep just fine.
Ok.
And I came to realize it's that fear that's the worst of it.
That's the real enemy.
So... get up.
Get out in the real world.
And you kick that bastard as hard as you can right in the teeth.
Do it again.
Go on.
"$10,000 even."
Same as last time.
It's totally accurate.
"You and I, we are gonna feed this machine."
- I want it running 24 hours a day.
- Right on.
"Not yours, I take it."
"We got 10, 20, 30,"
"44, 45 each."
3 pounds should be 48 each.
- Who's short?
- Ok.
"Don't freak, all right?"
We didn't get ripped off.
Badger hasn't kicked in his full amount.
"I know he's planning on pulling an all-nighter, so he's probably still in the sack."
Then wake him up.
He can sleep after we're paid.
Why you gotta be such a hard on?
You're not his pal.
You're his boss.
This only works when they're scared of you.
Jack off.
Are you?
"If I've got a plan, what is it?"
You tell me.
That's the way to do it!
Is this a test?
Yes.
What will it do to us?
Kill us.
That's the way to do it!
"So, come on then - plan, do I have one?"
I knew straight away.
"No, you didn't."
Course I did.
Show me!
Why should I?
Because we'll be dead in under 30 seconds.
Do I have a plan?
"If we'd been escaping, we'd be climbing down the building."
"If we'd been hiding, we'd be on the other side of the roof."
But we're standing right here.
So?
So!
After you.
After you.
"After you, I'm wearing a dress."
"Eyes front, soldier!"
My eyes are always front!
Mine aren't.
Stop it!
No!
I understand you're the previous governess.
I regret to inform you the position is taken.
Every bit of it has been skewed and twisted.
It's Crystal.
She's the one who's done this.
It has to be her.
Hi-yah!
Come on!
Yah!
Hi-yah!
"- That's it, that's all of 'em."
- Close the gate.
"All right, you two, you're finished here."
"It doesn't have to be like this, Matt."
But you don't get to decide that.
I don't want you near those horses again.
Same goes for Will Vernon.
You tell him that.
Let's go.
"We can't let this happen, Ty."
All those beautiful horses.
He's gonna send them to auction.
He's gonna let them die.
"Okay. don't worry about it, all right?"
"We'll figure this out, just one step at a time."
"Amy, look."
At least he's still free.
This isn't over yet.

ls he dead?
"Hey, come on."
Get that out of here.
Come on.
"- Jim, Butch, Mac, where you going?"
- Get out of here.
- Get out or we'll give it to you too.
- What are you trying to do?
Go to the pen?
You can't get away with this.
Go back there and put out that fire.
- We're gonna finish the job.
- You're playing into Thompson's hands.
- He'll hang you for this.
- Thompson's dead.
Thompson's dead?
"- Yeah, we took care of him."
"- Listen, kids, you gotta stop where you are."
Whatever you do will be another rap to beat.
I wouldn't give you a bum steer.
I'm in as bad a fix as you are.
- You think I ran out on you?
I didn't.
"- Sure, you ran out."
You ran.
Go on.
I didn't.
I meant to come back the day after I left.
I got into a fight and shot a rat.
I think I killed him.
I'm on the lam now.
"If they get me, it may mean the chair."
- What do you get for--?
I'm so hungry.
"I thought there was a cracker, or like some fruit left or some shit."
I don't know.
Put that away.
"Oh, I'm sorry."
Are you here to hurt me?
No no no.
No no.
"No no, we don't wanna hurt you."
Okay.
Not at all.
I'm sorry about him.
Yeah.
"We're robbers, and we're stuck down here with you."
You're robbers?
Yeah.
You don't make any sense.
We were pulling a heist.
I'm the leader.
He's part of my crew.
"Yeah, don't, don't judge us on our rugged exterior."
Find anything yet?
Nothing.
I think we just should have sent that text.
"Look, it was a good plan, okay."
"We found the jammer, we killed it, we could have gotten a phone call out."
So no one knows that you're here?
No.
Wait a minute.
Why would you rob this place?
"We, we thought it was legit."
There was no one here.
"Honest, that night, when you walked out of my place I made as if I didn't care."
I did care.
"After you'd gone, I kept wishing you'd come back."
"Truly, I did."
"This man, Hyde, will never trouble you again."
I give you my word.
How do you know?
He'll come back!
He'll come back and kill me!
No.
He won't come back.
I'll see to it.
"Oh, you don't know him, sir."
"Oh, you don't know him."
"He ain't human, he ain't!"
I gave you my word.
You'll never see Hyde again.
You must believe me.
"I believe you, sir."
I believe you.
You must go now.
"Yes, sir."
"Yes, sir."
"For a moment, I thought..."
Goodbye.
"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have admitted such a person."
I didn't know she was hysterical.
That's all right.
I'm glad you admitted her.
"Now, about the wedding, we've got a lot to discuss."
- We've never been married before.
- Let's not get upset.
I'm sorry.
No need to be sorry.
It's my fault.
I knew this day would come.
I thought I'd be okay.
"But in reality, I can't take it."
I am sorry too.
I am so sorry.
I didn't mean to leave you hanging.
"But there comes a time when we have to choose, right?"
And I just didn't choose work like you did.
Can I ask you to do one thing for me?
"Even if there's no work, call me sometime."
I'll call for sure.
"As soon as I give birth, you'll be the first person I call."
Oh shit.
I can't.
I have to call my dad.
Then I will call you 2nd.
You go do whatever you want to do then.
That photo I have lots of pimples.
Erase them for me.
No hurry.
Your deadline is 2 days.
Beyotch.
Make my boobs a little bigger too.
- Is this man the best you can do?
- When did I have time?
I'm always with you.

There is only one thing to do.
Give the signal.
"- When, now?"
- As soon as we can.
"So we won't think about it now, will we?"
"No, sir."
"When I do go, it will break your heart, won't it?"
"Yes, sir."
Well...
What would my little cherub like to do this evening?
"Oh, sir, could we go out?"
Out?
"You mean gad about a bit, see the sights?"
"Yes, sir."
"Oh, you'd like it, wouldn't you, sir?"
"Well, now, I don't know."
I don't know.
That might be very charming.
Where would we go?
"Oh, they say that the Empire and such places..."
They do?
Who does?
"Well, Marcia, sir."
She says it's ever so gay.
"- Oh, really?"
- Yes.
"We can go, can't we?"
They say that the bill is ever so good.
And I haven't been out for so long.
No.
"No, that's right."
"You haven't, have you?"
You do look a little pale.
Yes.
"Yes, that's true."
"Not that I am complaining, you understand..."
And I'm proud of you.
All right.
And that's that.

"Charlie, I think you'd better go up and get fixed up."
"Go ahead, kid."
"Sit down, Jim."
Sit down.
I'm not going to ask you why you beat it.
I can guess that easy.
"Well, we'll let that go."
"I wanna ask, I want you to tell me the truth."
What's the matter?

That-that's a lot of money.
How can I be sure you've got him?
"Well, you'll just have to take that on faith."
She slowly walked into my room...
Go on...
OK.
And one day...
I saw a woman at a subway.

That's already too late.

Driving a ten-wheeler must pay pretty well.
Are you awake?
Don't tell me you've banged me.
I'm not that desperate.

Kanji.

"Sir, Shreekant called off Jimmy's engagement"
I'll wait outside.

The prince..?
How?
Your Grace.
What?
The Crown Prince?
Yes.
Crown Prince.
Your Grace.
It's a pleasure to see you.
Shall I call for Yuning?
"No, I came to see you."
And how may I be of service?
Go see the Crown Prince.
I'm certain you can convince him.
The Crown Prince.
He's not in.
What?
Where is he?
Let's go.
"Lady Bong, Lady Bong?"
Your Grace.
We're leaving.
I want to see the Crown Prince again.
Huh?
"Yes, Your Grace."
Only through sincerity do we truly live...
It balances personal relations and is the basic virtue for all...
Prince...
Has all this business upset you?
"Yes, sir."
What happened to the Crown Prince is my fault.
"Okay, I'm done."
It's yours.
Your folks...
Hello.
"Kerim, we've arrived but we don't know where to go."
Where are you?
I don't know...
We've followed the road signs but...
- Can't you ask somebody over there?
"- There's no one to ask, around here."
"Is it my brother, give me the phone."
Give it to me.
- Abi?
- It's me.
Yenge.
What happened?
Fatmagül?
"- Fatmagül, you OK?"

"Hang up, I'll call you soon."
Come pick us up from here.
Fatmagül...
Pull yourself together.
"It's OK, don't be afraid."
You've just passed out.
Calm down.
Don't be afraid.
Is your foot too bad?
Where are they?
What's happening over there?
Seen it?
You got a rip in it.
Jack:
Is that a rip? man:
"Why don't you film down there, Jack?"
Let's see if we see a cup.
"Come on, that's it."
Jesus.
"You're not a student now, you know."
You're a working man.
There's no excuse.
Just here. man:
Is this where we're going?
Jack:
Yeah.
man:
"Two small beef burgers, believe it or not."
Imagine what the large ones are like or the medium ones.
"Ridiculous, isn't it?"
Unbelievable.
"Anyway, here you go, Jack."
This way.
I'm gonna sit in the car.
[seagulls crying]
What do you got?
Jack:
This. man:
Oh.

Why are you looking in the vegetable section?
TV and Video is over there.
Come.
We have to loot his shop.
- Speak softly.
What if he hears?
He is deaf.
Come sir.
"You sit here, and you sit here."
What will you take?
- I don't want anything.
Where did he go?
- I am here.
Why do you always do this?
- Did someone fall again?
"Not there, he fell here."
"I offer a chair, and you make him fall."
"Sorry sir, but he cannot see."
But he is good at his work.
Hello.
"- Not here, do it here."
Hello.
"- Not to the door, here."
Hello.
"- Come quickly, don't leave me alone with him."
We're coming.
"We'll be there soon, right Mukaddes?"
Almost there...
We missed the ferryboat.
But it's OK.
Are you crying?
But don't cry.
- Fatmagül's crying.
"- Come on, wrap it up Rahmi."
- Fatmagül?
- Yes?
I'll come and save you from that man.
- I'm going to the toilet.
Keep an eye on the kid.
- You heard me?
- I did.
- We'll be there soon.
OK?
- OK.
- God be with you.
"Don't be sad, don't cry."
I'll be with you by the evening.
I kiss your cheeks.
"- Abi, can you move the truck?"
- I am hanging up.
- The truck...
"- Yes please, there's a car behind."
I can't move it now...
"Murat, go fetch your mom."
Run!
"Sorry, my wife will be here now."
Ow! man:
Does it hurt?
Sasha:

Nice clean shave.
"Good job, buddy."
Here.
Sasha:
This is not clean. man:
Here's what we do.
Sasha:

And we put a little piece on there.
See?
And it sticks to the bloody part.
"And voila, he's done."
"Hey, wait."
"High five, buddy."
You survived it.
[animal bells ring]
man:
"Guys, it's not good to fall in love with girls"
"You have wives, so you are all right."
Whereas I don't have a wife.
Bitch. man:
What day is it today? man #2:
Good luck!
I'm so sorry.

He means to say you sing so well.
- Oh!
That's great!
You people chase goons and dacoits... ...and today you were chasing the music?
"Baby, you've yet not seen our talents."
But it's not good to move around freely.
"Yes, I know."
You've got a zero knowledge of music.
I am also a police officer's daughter.

One more day and they'll be bugs.
"Hey, Sunghee, come here."
Now what...

I swore to Sai Baba that I dont hit anybody on Thursday.
"Bhadra, may be the person sitting is the one we want."
Life is bitter.

I'm going to stay at your place for a few days for your punishment.
No.
My husband hates it when you visit.
No he doesn't.
He's just acting like it.

Let's go outside.
Sit!
This is strange.

We too didn't like it.
- What?
- Nothing.
And yes.
Listen!
I've a habit of drinking milk two times a day.

He's hanging on.
Trusting lads.
"You always said trusting lads was my problem, Bov."
I trust lads too much.
Trust the Yank too much.
This is how you prove your point?
Backstabbing me?
Teaming up with Tommy Hatcher to kill the Major?
Kill my fucking brother?
I'll kill Tommy.
"Just say the word, and I'll do it."
I don't need you for that.
I don't need you for anything anymore.

"No, sir."
"No, sir."
Let me go home.
My younger brother... ...is suffering from fever.
I had to do this for his treatment.
I've no support in life.

She was suffering from Asthma.
I didn't have money to give her the treatment.

What are we going to do?
"Also, exposure causes early onset."

We have to go this very minute.
"Okay, um...I'm on board."
"We'll change our last names, and then we'll call the cops."
"Right, right, right!"
They'll take her into custody.
She's no longer our problem.
I like that.
-Move!
Go!
-What?
GO!

"Yeah, I don't need to know that."
"No, no, no, no."
I am an expert in discharge.

"Nasal, Vaginal, Anal."
Our short webseries tells these stories.
It helps maintain the illusion.
"Miss Watson, she's a friend of mine."
She asked me to come.

"Mm, college man."
"Hi, I'm Lila."
Which Greek god are you?
"Lila, Russ and I are trying to talk here."
"Russ, is it?"

"Here's a little present for you, trashman."
Stop complaining.
Last time was the Big Sister.
Now you want me to be gay.
"No, thanks."
I don't want anything going through my back door.

Happy birthday.

This is strange.

No one knows who I am.
Open it.
Any story.
"Tenderly, as if whispering."
I'm busy here.
I have nothing to say.
I love...you.
Not that.
Something with a plot.
Oh I don't know.
What plot.
Hurry...
A long time ago...
In my ear.
Whisper!
"A long time ago, I was dating this woman."
She was a real virgin.
Really?
Yeah.
And so...?
"What do you mean, so?"
"Once she did it with me, she was no longer a virgin."
That's it?
Yes.
More specifically.
How did you meet her?
She lived next door.
And then?
"Well, then, one day."
Try to make it dramatic.
Like a movie.
Alright.
"One night, a night of brilliant moonlight,"
I was asleep... when the door opened quietly.
Catch him.
There he goes.

"Hey, I told you to draw me better."
"Look, my eyes are closed again."
Watch here.
Like this.
It's not working very well.
"Mom, do you regret it?"
Regret?
About me.
Do you regret it?
Why should I feel any regret?
It was my fault.
"No, it's Dad's fault."
Who is he?
His name is Venkat.
He is handsome and 6 feet tall.
That is the main problem.
Thank you.
Do you want another?
- It is enough for now.
Are you Venkat?
Yes.
Boss is calling you.
Get in to the jeep.
- Which boss?
This territory has only one boss.
Bhadram sir.
Why does he wants me?
Hey!
He got some work.
Shut up and get in to the jeep.
The boy is with me.
You go.
I will drop him at the house and follow you.
Who is he?
He is talking opposite to what we say.
Put both of them in the jeep.
Come on.
What is this?
Why are you so angry with us?
Sorry sir.
I said I will come.
Please leave the boy.
I would not cause any harm just caress him.
Take the boy home.
"Narin, please..."
Narin!
Narin!
No Narin!
NO!
It is not going to end like this...
This is not going to end like this.
1...2...3...4...5 1...2...3...4...5
Why did you save me?
Why did you?
I won't leave you Narin
I won't leave you...
Your life won't be like this.
I promise.
I promise...
Narin...
"Wake up, let's eat..."
Haven't you left?
How could I leave you?
I am not leaving.
I am here.
Don't do it.
Don't...
Don't cry...
I feel very ashamed before you.
Don't tell anybody.
I promise.
I won't tell anybody.
"But you have to promise me, too..."
"Whatever happens, don't give up on life."
Life is very valuable.
"You saw the bottom of the pain, Narin."
I'm not going to make it.
"Hey, put him down."
Down.
Let him down.
"Bastard, why did you let him fall off, huh?"
Go drive the ambulance.
Don't stare at me.
- Did you hit my friend?
- I didn't.
I did.
Just get in the ambulance.
Go.
Don't make me hit you too.
Go.
Hurry up.
This is amazing.
How's the sea?
It's alright.
Really?
I was thinking about going.
"Hey, how much are those two bottles of pepsi?"
"Well, it's been paid for."
"The man at that table has paid, sir."
What's this?
He's your next victim.
No way.
This is way too much.
"The last time, I had to put up with that Che."
"It's disgusting, eww..."
Don't get too dramatic.
Hey.
I've always managed.
You have to--
Sick!
You're so sick!
I'm so sorry.
I know.
The doctor said that you're gonna be okay.
He said it's just gonna take a little time.
We're leaving tomorrow.
It's not safe for us here now.
"- You all right, mate?"
- How is he?
He's hanging in.
"So, what now?"
You let Tommy know I want a straightener.
- Tomorrow.
- All right.
We finish this once and for all.
Somewhere quiet.
Away from old bill.
"Ike, your mate runs security at Trinity Wharf?"
- Yeah.
- Get hold of him.
Set it up.
Sure.
Come on.
What's going on?
Ben and I are on the noon flight to Boston.
You can't leave him.
He was trying to protect us.
"- You can't do this to him, Shannon."
"- Yes, she can."
She has to.
Then who the hell are you?
I'm...
I was sent by Jun Young-ju.
Jun...
Jun Young-ju
That name sounds really familiar...
Is it you?
Are you her new guy?
"No, I just..."
She sent me...
"Shut up, bastard."
Tell her this.
If she's got something to say.
"Beat it, punk."
What now?
Young-joo wants to breakup.
The excessive violence...
"Get lost, bastard!"
"Get a life, you shit."
-What?
"-Wait, wait..."
I delivered the message.
You heard it?
No I didn't!
Keep your nose out of other people's relationships!
"I don't deal with relationships, only break-ups!"
Go!
Beat it!
"Hey, I didn't hear anything."
Get lost!
"You don't get it, do you?"
"You listen to me, god damn it!"
Moron.
Have you been walking all this time?
Stupid..
"Ugh, again with that!"
Crap...
I'm dying here.
-What's with the car?
It's totally laid out.
- So does that make you happy?
Why are you hitting me?!
You are pissed off again..
"Ah, hot hot."
What...
Why he...
Wow...
I told you my major was Astrophysics.
We make spaceships so a car's nothing.
- Hey!
You don't even have a license!
- A driver's license?
- All a student need is a student ID.
-You funny.
"Oh, no!"
Get out!
- What.. -Jump!
What kind of person is your husband?
A good person!
But we don't love each other.
"My husband's a good person, too."
"He had an affair and so I did, too."
And that's howl ended up like this.
Who is it?
For the middle of nowhere.
You ready?
Come on.
Hey there.
"Hey, we're looking for, um,"
Abby Wilson.
She's not home.
Is there anything I can do for you?
"That's ok, we can come back."
"I'm sorry, but you look so familiar."
"Yeah, Abby's my mom."
Oh.
I'm Jamie.
"Um, you guys want to come inside?"
Right this way.
You guys sure you don't want anything?
"We got fresh O.J., coconut water, some mango guava something."
Water's fine.
Cool.
"So, ahem, are we, like, related?"
"Oh, no."
"Uh, Abby's not my mom."
Oh.
Good.
"Yeah, she, uh, she dated my old man back in the day."
"He was kind of a deadbeat, so when they broke up, she took me in."
Put me through school.
Didn't freak out when I totaled her car.
Twice.
She sounds...Great.
- Yeah.
- Jamie?
Don't worry about Yuning.
My mother and her cronies want to banish Yuning because of me.
They think he's a threat to my crown.
Prince.
But I have no right to the throne.
And so I won't allow an innocent like Yuning to be hurt.
What are you saying?
No right to your throne?
Does the Crown Prince know?
Does he?
Sire.
The Crown Prince to see you.
- Yun?
"- Yes, Sire."
Yun.
Father.
"Well, then, what is it?"
I'd like to see the Crown Prince.
He's gone to see the King.
What?
What's your business here?
Your Grace.
"Now, what did you want to tell me?"
"Father, I have no right to be Crown Prince."
What?
"I have a basic obligation to the Royal House, the court and the nation."
"But I'm quite ill, Father."
I refuse to hide the truth just to keep a crown.
You're ill?
What are you saying?
Yun.
Well?
Someone else gave my mouth a six and one third.
What's wrong with my mouth?
"God, I'm having a nervy B."
We've only gone over the plan a gazillion times.
You don't need to have a breakdown.
Just stick to your lines and we'll be fine.
Okay.
How's my hair?
Very Keira Knightley.
"Just get in there, you minger."
"Remember, lower your voice so you sound sexier."
Okay.
"- Hi there, how are you?"
"- Oh, fine, thanks."
- Can I get some onions please?
- Onions.
Red ones?
- Yeah.
- How many?
"Just a pound, please."
- A pound.
- Yeah.
"- These are nice ones, these are."
- Great.
What are you doing?
Jas?
"Hey, Jas."
Quelle surprise.
What a shock to see you here.
I want this brother.
That's fine.
Just stop playing with your hair.
What are cannibals doing here?
Those are also the robots I built.
-Then stop them!
-Well that is...
They will let you go if you pay $100.
This is too much.
Making money even with this?
"If you pay extra $500, they will make you their chief."
How does that sound like?
"Atom, where in the world are you?"
"Hey, Pura."
Where are you going?
Don't go too far.
Pura!
Watch out!
"You must be Zora, right?"
What a suction power!
I could get rid of it if Pura weren't with me.
It's not that smart.
"That's not your mom, Pura."
There it is!
Follow it immediately.
Don't lose it!
Huh?
What is that?
Waterfall...
Let's take a rest.
"Ah, Pura."
Where are you going?
What's wrong?
Is something there?
All right.
- The ocean!
- Really?
-You'll be back by nightfall.
Which ocean?
A tumbling open Ocean
We need to be careful.
Since your husband's is cop.
The back seat!
-Why the flowers?
- A present for you!
What's this?
You didn't wear any?
Getting bold.!
Why?
Are you cold?
Cold wind is getting in underneath.
"- Next time, let's really go to Manila."
- Don't joke.
- You don't believe me?
- No I don't.
Shall I make reservations now?
"In the summer, we'll go."
Like a honeymoon.
- I can't go.
-You promised.
I'm in front of my house.
Okay.
I'll be home soon.
-What's wrong?
- Did I leave the stove on?
The rice cooker?
- It only takes him 30 minutes to get home.
What are you doing?
Which is this way to console someone?
What consolation means to the ruined people?
We're goner!
We're ruined!
"I pray to God, why he didn't picked me?"
Those goons could have kidnapped me in place of Radha.
- God!
My God!
She's a young girl!
And that young boy.
Mohit!
Come here.
Just rub my back.
"Mohit, come here, dear."
My God!
Mohit!
Rub my back.
Come here.
"Come, dear."
Come!
Rub my back.
Why are you rubbing it softly?
Do it with pressure.
That's good!
Whatever you say.
But the girl is really nice. t seems we've got a spring in the garden.
Our life passed between thieves and criminals.
But she sings so well!
What a dance!
Wow!
Rub in my front body too.
Go.
Go.
- Who is that imposter?
Hello.
"Play it, play it."
"Go ahead, feed Him."
- What's wrong with the mic?
Take a look.
- What's wrong with the mic?
Where's everyone going?
"Go, go."
- No.
Where are you going?
- Go.
Get down.
Play it.
- Wait everyone.
Wait.
Even Siddeshwar Maharaj is asking you to go.
"Go, go, leave."
- Leave me.
What have you done?
"No, papa."
"- Fool, breaking pots during exam times."
"Stop it, stop it."
Go and feed some butter to the Lord.
I won't stop you next time.
Stop you fool!
You'll be punished for your unpardonable sin.
He will punish you Himself.
He will punish you.
Don't try to scare me in the name of Lord.
Could we get off that subject?
"I want us to be friends, Harry."
I want us to trust each other.
Then be honest with me.
"If you knew who he was, would you tell me?"
May.
"Oh, what, Ben?"
Wait.
Aunt May.
"Oh, my."
"Oh, Peter."
"Oh, for a second there, I thought I was years ago."
"Everybody's gone, aren't they?"
Did they have a good time?
I'm sure they did.
You okay?
Of course.
But you go home.
And be careful.
I don't like that scooter thing you drive around.
I'm worried about you.
You're so alone.
And I saw the letter from the bank.
"Oh, my."
You did?
"Oh, well."
So?
I'm a little behind.
Everybody is.
"Anyway, I don't want to talk about it anymore."
"I'm tired, and you better start back home."
"Here, kiddo."

- Love your hair.

"No, I love the air."
"Anyway, with my freeze ray I will stop..."
"- Hey, doc."
"- Moist, my evil, moisture buddy, what's going on?"
Life of crime.
Got your mail.
"Hey, didn't you go on a date last night?"
Conflict Diamond told me you were doubling with Bait And Switch.
Yeah.
Yeah?
It was alright.
I kinda thought I was supposed to end up with Bait but...
I hear you.
I saw Penny today.
You talked to her?
So close.
Just a few weeks from a real audible connection.
I'm gonna ask...
Oh my God!
Is that from the league?
"It's from him, that's his seal, isn't it?"
The leader?
Oh my God!
I got a letter from Bad Horse!
That's so hardcore.
"Bad Horse is legend, he rules the league with an iron hoof."
Still you better give them a call.
They are really worried.
"Especially Cemre Abla, she called me at least 20 times."
- 20?
"- Okay, maybe 10."
Where have you been?
I was worried to death!
Here I am.
"See you, bro!"
"Okay, go on."
Thanks.
God bless.
Your phone was off.
Yunus said he didn't know where you were.
I was scared.
"Here I am, in one piece."
Don't panic.
- Called you father?
- Mhm.
We kept waiting at the gates for you to come out.
"You escaped from us, huh?"
Where did you go?
What did you do?
There was a error.
I just had to fix it.
"That Barış jerk, I fixed him."
I knew you'd do something like that.\
"Don't worry, from now on."
That punk can't do anything to you.
You don't worry.
Okay?
Okay.
I'll prepare some mango juice for you.
"That's the problem, Kishen."
You don't have to make mango juice.
Why?
"- I helped you, didn't it?"
- Yes.
So what can you do for me?
Give my life?
"- No, no."
"- Yes, I can give my life."
"No, no, no."
- I will do it.
Kishen.
Listen.
You will have to do a small favour for me.
"Yes, tell me."
Remember Mala.
Mala.
That witch Mala.
"- Yes, that witch Mala."
You will have to.. - What?
I've to treat her to mango juice.
"- No, no, no."
You've to make her.. fall.
She's already fallen quite low.
How much further do you want me to make her fall down?
"No, no, I don't mean literally."
How do I explain to you?
Yes.
You've to..
No.
"- Oh, God."
Am I looking like a mad person?
No.
The marriage will take place at the decided moment.
The bride will come.
Kasi will bring her.
We share the same blood.
"Boss, Kasi has come."
"Uncle, did I not tell you?"
Kasi has come.
Shailaja has come.
Kasi!
Kasi!
"Uncle, did I not tell you?"
I know that you will bring her.
You are a true brother.
Tell me where she is.
Brother!
You made me your younger brother.
You also gave me everything.
But I could not do what you wanted.
I came here because he spared my life.
I dont want such a life.
I dont want this life.
No.
Give it to me.
I am telling you.
Get up.
What are you saying?
Are you mad?
"Uncle, he says that he wants to die."
"Aunty, he says that he wants to die."
"Hey, dont die."
"Don't say anything to Cemre, okay?"
Don't let her know.
Or I won't forgive you.
"Okay abla, don't worry."
You said Cemre wasn't going to come.
It seems she changed her mind.
- Hello Sami Amca.
- Hey Cemre.
I thought you wouldn't come.
"I didn't mean to disappoint you, but... here I am."
Let me help.
- Let me help you.
- A moment.
"Could you hold these, Cemre?"
My hand is empty.
- I'll take them back.
- I could help you till the door.
"No no, you give them to me."
You can go sit in the car if you want.
Don't worry about us.
Go see your son.
"Right, for 15 minutes or so."
"Sami Amca, can you give these to Kuzey?"
From Demet and me.
Put in my pocket.
And this is my letter.
- Okay.
- Say him hello from us.
- I will.
- Kiss Kuzey for me.
Let's get in the car if you want.
"Thank you, I'm fine here."
It's none of your business.
Sit down.
Look at your friend.
Who got bit by a stroke.
"Yes, Sylvester."
Gaze at her and make her pay.
Pay money?!
See...
Stop laught at him.
Hush!
This is a hospital.
What's the matter?
"Nurse, get him out of the hospital."
Why you call me out?
He's my buddie.
"Good, follow me, sir."
Is it OK?
Don't you play tricks!
We contacted his family... ...but they denied know him.
We found these in his pocket.
Stop looking at him.
What do you said?
Shut your big mouth.
You're a big mouth!
What is this?
These are blood-stayed but they aren't your friend's.
"Mom, let's go look for him."
Look for who?
Your husband.
I saw him with a woman yesterday.
He's got a mistress.
Don't you know that?
He plays very well.
"And he seems very friendly. yes, Julio, my best friend is very friendly and"
likes all the girls.
Sorry if I missed some chunks.
I've only been learning Spanish for 2 years!
"So here x is 0, y is 2."
So let's see.
3 times 0 plus 6 times 2 is equal to 0 plus 12.
"Doesn't equal 2, it equals 12."
This one doesn't work.
I'm just taking 3 times x plus 6 times y and seeing what it equals.
"In this case, we have 3 times 0 plus 6 times y."
Plus 6 times 6.
Well that's 0 plus 36.
That doesn't equal 2.
Can't be that choice.
"This one, we have 3, this 3, times 1."
Plus 6 times this y.
6 times minus 1/6.
So let's see.
That's 3.
That's equal to 3.
"And then, 6 times 1/6 is 1, but we have a negative out there."
So it's minus 1.
That is equal to 2.
So that works.
3 times 1 plus 6 times negative 1/6 is equal to 2.
So our answer is C.
Problem 29.
Let me see if I need to cut and paste this one in.
All right.
"So yeah, I think it's a good idea."
"Wow, no way."
None
You're wearing a gold necklace today.
Today's fashion is...
This is being filmed.
Why does that matter?
Zelo says his socks are a 'miss' to his fashion today.
So he doesn't want to be filmed.
- Super star Zelo!
"- No, no."
Stop filming.
"Are you playing the ""solitude game""?"
"This must be the ""solitude game"" you enjoy."
How'd you know that?
I'm scared!
I'm scared!
"Dog, you say, ruff!"
It's not a Korean dog.
You're not a Korean dog but hand!
Hand!
"Don't do that, don't do that."
Right.
"Dog will... hand, hand."
I told you not to do that.
This does connect to usb.
- I bought a few LP's too.
- He bought LP's!
- There are more LP discs in Korea.
- I gotta go to Chung-gye-cheon now.
"Finally, we head to our first MV shooting."
None
"- Hey, gimme the room key."
Give us dinner.
You can go up now.
"Ha Ni, you finished everything too?"
"Yes, I'll finish up the rest."
"Okay, then it's a favor."
Good night.
Ha Ni.
Welcome.
Why aren't you sleeping yet?
I want to drink some water.
"Eun Jo, you didn't sleep yet."
"This time, you helped with a lot of things."
Thank you.
Punk.
He has some cuteness to him.
You were here.
I guess I ended up moving back in.
Just don't get in the way.
Okay.
"Ah, you came?"
Why are you still here and not leaving?
I was going to go after finishing this.
Go upstairs first.
"Ha Ni, go up."
"Ha Ni, wait."
"Today, Bong Joon Gu's first piece of work was a success."
Yeah.
"Ha Ni, you haven't eaten dinner yet, have you?"
"I knew it would be like that, so I made these."
"Sit down, sit down."
"Father, sit down please."
Here.
Let him!
What do you mean?
He's got a mistress!
"And a kid, too!"
You let him do that?
Are you not going?
Fine.
I'll go myself.
I'll chop him to pieces.
No sweat!
"Don't do anything stupid, Moon!"
"Moon, don't!"
Leave me alone!
Stop it!
What's are you doing?
Then go with me!
"Listen to me, will you?"
Leave me alone.
Listen to me!
I approved him of doing that.
Stop it!
What?
You approved of hime?
You mean you had know it?
You approved him for the sale of thousand bucks?
"Moon, get on the car."
Where're you heading?
I've no idea.
"In that case, I'll just drop you alone the way."
I've to go to work.
What did you say?
"Did I hear ""work""?"
Whoa.
*(revving engine)*
Aah!
Principal Cooper?
Can you believe these people don't separate their paper from plastic?
"Egbert, down, now."
Just doing... my part to save the environment.
"Liz, wake up."
You've got to help me with my stories.
Your stories?
Don't tell me you didn't write them.
Of course I wrote them.
"OK, so maybe I didn't write them."
Jess.
It's not my fault.
I didn't get in until 3:00.
We went to the movies.
All night?
What did you see?
I don't know.
Russ was in the way.
Anyway...
"Liz, please."
Here's the pen.
I'm begging.
Why can't you do it?
I have to put on my makeup.
You've got two hours.
I know.
"It'll be tight, but I can just skip my bikini wax."
"I'm sorry, Jess, but this is your assignment."
You'll have to do it yourself.
I should stay out of danger.
Run!
Who are you?
I am a lieutenant of the police!
"If you fear this sword, then move aside!"
"I mean, I'll attack you!"
Halt!
What's this?
Why are you here?
I was worried you'd be in danger!
That you'd be caught!
You'll be in danger if you're with me.
So go back!
What about you?
The police are everywhere!
What if they see a lady from a noble house involved with thieves?
I don't care.
Then do what you want.
I don't care.
Who hit me?
Damn it.
What do I do with you?
It's better for you to be a hostage than a thief.
- Move aside!
- Stand your ground!
Move aside.
"If she gets hurt, we'll all be in trouble."
Miss Eun Hye...?
- Follow him!
"- Yes, Sir!"
Miss Eun Hye...!
Miss Eun Hye!
Take care.
We might not be able to see again until the trial.
You want anything from us?
No.
Just your good health.
Tell the lawyer if you wanna eat anything.
I'll cook and send it over.
"Okay, but it's not needed."
"I took a vow, when you get out of this place... ..."
I will feed orphans.
Look...
Stay away from the prison dogs.
- God be with you.
- Stay away from them.
Inshallah you'll be out after the first trial.
We'll see.
Inshallah.
We got the appointment for 13th of the month.
"Oh that, I got it."
I wish you the best.
Good for you...
"Goodbye, son."
See you.
- See you.
- Goodbye.
Handan Pakel.
Can I have my bag?
Have a good day.
"Ilyas, where are you?"
"Okay, I'm coming."
Can I have my ID as well?
Sami Tekinoğlu.
Let's just have a drink.
Alright.
I'll be back.
- Slow.
- Yes.
- Slow.
- Yes.
What are you doing?
We can drink with our clothes off.
At least our tops.
Let's do it when it feels right.
It feels right to me.
"Okay, then I'll show..."
I'll show you up to here... so can't we just stay like this and just talk?
No!
You've changed all of a sudden.
Humans are like that.
Then undress up to there at least.
Yes.
What are you doing?
Why are you undressing?
Let's just do it once.
Do what?!
Just once...
Come this way.
Look.
- This is funny.
Really!
- Let's just do it once.
Look.
Can you buy some more liquor?
We've drunk all.
Why not?
You challenged him to a race.
Look.
He called the lift for you.
All right.
I'll reconsider.
What's up?
Do we have to walk the rest?
Rex wanted to show you he can both call and stop a lift.
I think he's shown me enough for today.
"Hello, Anna."
What are you doing here?
"Mummy, Daddy's here."
"I know, darling."
- Did you come for something?
- Just what we agreed on.
"- One, two..."
- You can take the lot.
I want what I was awarded in the divorce settlement.
They're taking my job off me.
Have you been drinking?
Did you hear what I said?
I've lost my job.
Don't you care?
You didn't ask how Anna and I are.
"Come on, darling."
You're still talking about yourself.
"No, I don't really care."
"Bye, Dad."
I hope we've got enough to last.
Höilerer isn't here.
There should be enough.
Yeah.
Thank you.
"I--Yeah, I love--"
I love you too.
I do.
Yeah.
"Yeah, my parents know."
Yes.
"Well, Grandma, they call it being gay now."
"You don't have to say ""homosexual."""
It's not--Yeah.
"Yes, it's not a disease."
Thank you.

"Here, throw some cheese to those ducks."
Get closer to them.
"I'm taking a video, Sarah."
Sarah:
They might bite me. man:
"No, they won't bite."
Ducks don't bite.
Come on.
I'm making a video.
Walk on out into them.
It'll be a good video. man #2:
Would you like me to take both of you? man:
Oh. man #2:
Take another picture of you? man:
Thank you. man #2:
Just tell me what do you want me to do. man:

Take care.
You...
Yue Canglong is here to revenge for his senior
Yue Canglong?
"Miss Mu, hurry."
Hurry!
"You aren't going anywhere,"
I'll cut out your hearts and eat them.
You're dead.
You're awake.
Do you want some water?
Did you see my face?
No.
No?
Really?
Why would I lie?
"When I fainted, you could have lifted up my veil."
"I was cleaning up your wound,"
I wasn't aware of that.
You cleaned up my wound?
Then you saw my body?
That of course.
Come here.
You want water?
What was that for?
How dare you see my body?
I'll kill you.
The blood is clear now.
Let me find you some herbal medicine.
Don't pretend to be kind.
Red Python
"Tuan Yu, catch it."

My son wishes that I would just stay sick.
"I don't scold him, I don't go drinking..."
How long has it been hurting?
Yes?
- Just... since the accident.
"- No, I don't mean that."
Haven't you had abdominal pain?
It must've been quite severe.
Listen carefully to what I tell you.
I already told your husband.
"Wait a minute, wait!"
Time out!
Wait!
I didn't mean to hit you.
Nice job.
You're the best human sandbag.
Excuse me!
"Sorry, but could you do me a favor?"
- Me?
- Yes.
"If he asks who you are,"
-just tell him you're someone I know.
-Yes...
Yes... hello?
I am...
What is... your name?
"Mi-ryung, Song Mi-ryung."
"Well, I'm an acquaintance of Song Mi-ryung."
And next?
I want to break up with him.
"- Okay, come."
Are you blind since childhood?
- Yes.
"Me too. . . . it's okay, don't worry."
It's okay. . .say hello to aunty.
Come.
What is your name?
- Babu.
"Babu, are you Hindu or Muslim?"
Where did he go?
Strange!
I asked him his religion and he disappeared?
It's time for my bus to come.
Who throws such things on the street like that?
Hey guy! . . . idiot!
Why are you. . . .
What are you doing in the middle of the street?
Damn !
What are you doing?
Move!
Move!
Can't you hear?
The traffic has got jammed because of you.
Mangoes?
You sell mangoes?
I don't eat mangoes.
I don't sell mangoes.
The traffic has got jammed because of you.
"If you have finished work, go home."
Why tell me?
I am stuck here.
Why are you troubling me?
"- Don't forget what I told you last night, OK?"
Vural.
- Don't (do something silly).
- OK.
"Naci, take Vural where he needs to go."
- What's the matter?
"- Last night, he kept me up till morning."
- What's his problem?
- He says Kerim didn't do anything.
- Get out of here.
- He meant it.
Selim!
He says that the girl was unconscious.
And Kerim was just sitting beside her.
He was gonna tell Kerim everything but I talked him out of it.
Is he out of his mind?
"- Selim, what are you doing there?"
"- Coming, dad."
He really didn't do it?
God damn it.
Now we're done for!
It's on the Internet now.
We can't stop it now.
It'll be on the newspapers tomorrow.
God damn it!
Did you talk to Kerim?
These idiots don't know where he is.
"I'm calling him, uncle."
He's not picking up.
Stop calling him.
He'll think it's a big deal.
Let him think it's a big deal.
Why hasn't he?
"Oh, he's got some idea he's looking for somebody."
Oh.
Passport and all the rest was just to throw us off.
Maybe.
May have planned to change places with Priamos at the last minute.
"They were friends, weren't they?"
They had a fight.
I told you.
You think I'm lying?
They'll be closing the net.
We'd better get downtown.
What about me?
I'll get you a cab.
"Oh, no, you don't."
I'm going along.
I gotta get to Gus 'cause we're gonna get married.
You said he was dead.
"Look, I've got some rights."
"After all, I was the one who called you, wasn't I?"
Yeah.
You were the one.
( somber theme playing )
"Hey, Gus."
"Come on, Gus."
"Are we home, Johnny?"
"No, Gus."
I had to get off the streets.
We're in an alley over by the river.
Are they going to catch us?
Not a chance.
How do you feel?
Tell Kerim to call him.
"OK, a second."
Need a pen...
Where did I put them...
"- A moment, there..."
"- Okay, no need to rush."
I'm writing.
"OK, I'll save it to my cell phone as well."
He'll be waiting for Kerim to call.
- OK.
"- Tell him to go meet him, he'll help him."
- Thanks to him.
- And how are you?
- Do you need anything?
"- No, thank you very much."
"- Good night, see you."
- See you.
Come on.
Get inside.
You'll catch a cold.
Take these on your shoulders then.
"Have your medicine, too."
That lawyer named Münir knows where they are.
He knows or he knows not.
What is it to you?
Just forget about them.
You know what...
I didn't believe a word he said to me.
He's a bastard like the others.
"Look, brother..."
I know it's hard to accept but...
Everyone knows about it now...
"I told you that I don't want to kill anyone, why aren't you leaving?"
Have you forgotten our enemy?
Charge.
Follow me.
"Mercy, please"
I didn't know you're so able.
"Miss Mu, could you slow down?"
I'm afraid.
Let me down.
What was that for?
Shut up.
"I didn't tell you to talk, shut up."
Why?
You are very violent.
Let me go.
I don't want to be with you.
Shut up.
I won't.
Shut up.
I won't.
I'll curse if you don't let me go.
Go ahead if you have guts.
"In my whole life,"
I've been cursed by many people.
Why don't you?
"I pity you, that's why I won't."
"Don't think I'm scared of you,"
"I'll kill you, are you scared now?"
I'm not scared.
"Miss Mu, wait, Miss Mu."
Miss Zhong.
"Of all the people, you want her help?"
Your yenge is calling.
If you say her anything...
What's the matter sir?
You're bothering our customers.
"- It's okay, we're sorry."
"- You can go out, and sort it out there if you want."
It's all right.
It's over now.
"- You couldn't wake up, huh?"
- I wasn't sleeping.
And we departed in the morning.
We're half way there.
- When do you think you'll be here?
- Hopefully before it's dark.
- Where are you?
- We're in a hotel in Beyoglu.
"Okay, we'll come there then."
Is it Fatmagül?
"- What's Fatmagül doing, is she with you?"
"- Give it to me, let me talk with her."
- Her brother wants to talk.
- Give it to me.
Hello?
Hello?
No body is there.
- Abi...
- Are you all right sister?
"- I am OK, are you coming?"
- We're on our way.
We hit the road before the dawn.
Are you OK?
- I think about all the time.
Don't hurt her.
Ow... my leg hurts.
It's hard to walk with this.
"Well, it's a part of the plan."
"Dow, your leg is not lame."
I never thought you would be this stupid.
Ha ha.
"Why don't you kill me now, you lying bitch."
- Don't you dare call her that.
- Lying bitch.
Are you insulting my wife?
What?
What?
Let's go Rung.
I'm so sick of his face.
"Just a minute, Dow."
Let me take my revenge.
"You forced me to call you ""lord"""
I'll get you back now.
"Hey, what are you going to do?"
I'll leave this with you so you will think of me.
"Call me ""Baron"""
- What Baron?
- You won't call?
"Call me ""Ananda"""
"Call me ""Ananda""."
- I command you.
- Ow...
"Now your life depends on the weather, Che."
"Let's go, Dow."
"Let's go, Rung."
You bastards.
I don't know.
Maybe because I'm so lonely?
"Is your husband quiet, too?"
My husband?
As he walked out of the wedding hall he closed his mouth and he's been quiet ever since.
"Ah, It's cold."
Don't.
You're going to get my clothes wet.
Stop it.
My shoes are all wet.
So what!
They're not mine.
You look lonely.
I'll buy lunch today.
Whatever you want!
"But, at student cafeteria."
"They're freshmen, aren't they?"
How do you know?
Because they look tacky.
It's good!
"Back in my day, it wasn't."
"Did you go to college, too?"
Why?
Anything say that I can't?
"No, of course not."
What was your major?
What do you think?
I don't know.
Philosophy.
Huh?
It can't be!
Brat...
- Don't hit me!
Don't hit me!
- Come here right now!
- Come any closer and I'll jump and kill myself!
- Hey.. this is the first floor.
You won't die.
Ah..
It's the first floor.
Don't come any closer.
Don't.
Come over here right now!
Mom..
You dirty bastard.
Why did you bring my mother?
Why bring my poor mother here?!
I'm gonna kill myself!
Listen bitch!
Do that in your own home!
Why you!
Bitch!
You call yourself a friend?!
"You bastard, you fooled around, too!"
Remember?
He secretly loved a woman for 3 years.
And I couldn't even tell anyone... ...because I thought my mom would worry...
-Why the hell are you here?
- Come here now!
- Do you have no shame?
The neighbors!
-What's the big deal?
It's not our neighborhood.
- Come on.
- Okay!
Did he say something?
Forget it.
"Okay, you handle these customers, I'll go to the counter."
What if anyone steals something.
What do you want?
- TV and Video.
I bought this clock from you.
It came with a guarantee of one year.
Then come after one year.
None of its needles move.
What?
- None of its needles move.
I'll repair it for you in a jiffy.
Key.
Here's the key.
The parts of this car are no good.
"- This was not a car, it was a clock."
Clock?
Shouldn't you have told me before?
And why did you bring a clock here?
You should have taken it to a clock shop.
Strange man.
You bought so many things?
- Yes.
Just a minute.
"Okay, I'll make the bill, you make the payment."
Bill?
- Yes.
Pay him money.
"- Here, take."
What are you doing?
Tell me.
- No.
"Kanji, what are you doing?"
Why are you scared?
Take the gun.
"Get down now, come on."
The phone's ringing again.
Forget it.
You switched of your mobile.. ..that's why they're calling on the landline now.
Tell them I am not at home.
They say if we don't arrange for the money.. ..we'll have to vacate the house in a month.
I had so many dreams.
I wanted to make Jigna a pilot.
And my son a cricketer.
But soon I'll even lose this house.
Everything's lost.
Everything will be fine.
What will be fine?
All I have is the shop property.
"I'll sell that and repay the mortgage. "" Om Jai Jagdish Hare. """
""" Swami.. """
Yes.
"Yes, he's here."
It's Nimish.
- Who?
Who Nimish bhai?
- The estate agent.
Oh yes.
"Yes, Nimish."
Go ahead.
Did you find a buyer for that property?
What are you saying?
"Oh, this is a deathtrap right here, I swear."
"Okay, I'm just gonna leave that place."
"Oh, God, there he is."
(high-pitched static)
I knew I shouldn't have gone towards the tunnel.
"Oh, no, I'm in a fence."
"Oh, my God, what am I supposed to do?"
"(gasping) Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."
He's gonna find me.
"- ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - Oh, my God."
(high-pitched static) (footsteps crunching)
"- ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - Oh, whoa, no, no, no, no, no, no."
"No, no, no, no, no."
"No, no, no, no, no."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
I don't see him. - ♪ (jolting chord) ♪ - Oh!
Oh-ho!
- (high-pitched static) - What the heck?
Please don't be in here.
"Oh, my God."
I thought there was something behind me.
(laughs) (sighs) Okay.
(pulsating echo)
"Oh, no!"
No!
No!
No!
- No!
No!
No!
- (high-pitched static) (muffled scream)
- Don't hurt her.
- I'm not going to.
We have to get out of here.
They won't take me.
They won't take me.
Not again.
No!
No!
Manuel!
No!
No!
Manuel!
Hello?
"Pablo, where are you?"
"Malena, listen."
The son-of-a-bitch who's behind this is connected with the military.
Where did you find the diary?
What the fuck does that matter?
"- In the car, right?"
- So what?
"Pablo, do me a favor and just for once try and think with your head."
Who could have written that diary?
Think about it.
"No, not that, Malena."
Dad was a son-of-a-bitch.
"He may have been a son-of-a-bitch to you, but not to me."
I was thinking...
"Imagine he had the diary, but he found it and it wasn't his."
Whose was it otherwise?
Some other doctor's.
How should I know?
Give him a break.
Let's call it even if I go to bed with you.
500 bucks?
"You're not telling me that it'll cost $4,500 to get laid with you?"
What do you think you are?
Julia Roberts?
Let me get it straight.
I nerver paid for getting laid.
Come on!
There's no one it the house except us.
Relax!
I won't hurt you.
Answer me.
What color is your panty?
Guess.
Black and white.
Show me.
What's that?
This is no panty.
What the best!
Let's get on with it.
Why are you laughing?
Something funny going on here?
"Must be your mom, isn't it?"
She wants to put me into jail?
"You only listen to your mom, don't you?"
You'll regret this: it's my first time.
Your first time?
Are you pulling my leg?
Every girl I've fucked told me it's her first time.
You think this is the Middle Ages?
First time my foot!
"It's my first time, too -- I mean for today."
"You, don't tickle me!"
Don't tickle me!
Don't tickle me!
I'm going to kill you.
I have to start from the toe...
"This won't do, you make me laugh."
Put on a serious expression!
Serious!
I bought some!
This way.
Oh!
They're made in China.
I can't trust them.
They're okay.
"If you're nervous, I'll use two."
I don't use any Chinese products even at home.
- Wait!
- Now what?
The buttons can't get ripped.
Wait.
Let me catch my breath.
I'm breathing so hard I think I'm going to suffocate.
You're really nervous.
Can't we just have a drink?
You want me to go buy some?
We can have it delivered.
No.
I'll go buy some.
Delivery's expensive!
Just have it delivered.
No.
I'll just go out and get some..
A woman by the water took off her clothes and...
"You love me, don't you?"
Don't talk nonsense.
Love?
"In the chat room, yes."
Not in reality.
No.
"I love you, too."
Alright?
I love you.
Don't go.
"Love, my ass!"
Bastard.
"Are you selling out love now, too?"
You bastard.
You deserve it.
I love you.
For real.
What happened with the college student?
- He's going off to complete his army duty.
-Why?
All of a sudden?
He's running off from my husband.
That hurts.
"If the sun comes up will he come, When the wind blows he'll leave."
"When I look at you, you're ignoring me."
Please wind stop blowing.
Why are you eating everything?
Stop eating the bone.
"It's no use holding you, you just go away."
Please wind stop blowing.
I don't know
"If you don't want to do it, just say so."
It's so tacky hedging like this.
I'm not good at talking.
You're driving me crazy.
Really.
Do you know howl feel every time I go home after we meet?
No.
What do you think?
You don't think about that?
No.
Your underwear.
Can't you give me a call when you're not coming home?
It's not a big deal.
- Eat before you go.
- That's okay.
I'll just go.
Where are you going?
I'm going to look for a job.
You never last three days.
"Still, I'm going to look."
I don't want to shrivel up and die at home like this.
- It's tingling.
"-Why, why, why?"
"Ah, My beard?"
- Yes.
Go shave!
- I don't want to.
- Go shave!
Go now!
- Let's just do it.
- Don't get it on me.
- Come here.
- 30 minutes?
We can get there before he arrives.
How can we get there in 30 minutes?
Don worry.
"Oh, just leave it."
It won't explode.
- It probably will.
- Really?!
"Oh, no."
Why is it so loud.
Who is it..
What the hell?
What's he doing here...
How?
- Don't open the door!
"Hey, why is he here?"
- He happened to call I told him you're here.
- Go home and fight it out!
- Crazy bitch.
Hurry up and leave.
Do you know how many days you've been here already?
- My husband told me to send you home.
- Crazy bitch.
Tell him I'm not here.
You're crazy.
Hurry up and come out.
- Hey!
That man might kill me!
- Then beg him to kill you first!
"- I beg him to do that, he might really do it!"
- Then beg for your life instead!
Whatever!
"Yes, sure."
"No, father."
Mother has told you not to play flute.
You just keep quiet.
Can't you see sir is going to pay us a big amount.
"C'mon, sit down."
"- Yes, go ahead."
Father!
Father!
- That's it?
Are you done?
Pasha sir!
I'll play flue.
Let me rest for some time.
"No, father."
You will not play flute.
I'll play it.
"Pasha sir, I'll play flute."
Will you play flute?
"C'mon, go on."
Ramu!
Your wife died.
Father!
"No one understand the language of flute, my child."
They only understand the language of stick.
Only of the stick.
"C'mon, I'll teach you my language."
"You name is Jaikishan, right?"
- Yes.
"But I'll call you only Kishna, you know why?"
Because you play such nice flute.
From where did you learn it?
They were only a first pass.
You're my friends and I want you to be 110% satisfied.
"Not to worry, I'll redo them."
"Oh, Rarity."
You don't have to do that.
They're fine.
I want them to be better that just fine.
I want you to think they're absolutely perfect.
Are you sure?
"I mean, we wouldn't wanna impose."
"Oh, it's no ???."
"Really, I insist."
"Well, in that case..."
"Thank you again, Rarity."
What have I gotten myself into?
Hello?
"You wanted to see me, Rarity?"
Fluttershy!
Your new-new gown's ready.
I completely revised it and I know you're going to love it.
What do you think?
I... ...love it.
"Oh, you're just saying that."
"No, no."
I do.
It's... nice.
"""Nice""?"
Nice.
"If you don't like it, you should just tell me."
"Oh, but I do like it."
Like it or love it?
Um... both?

- No.
"- So it's fine, then?"
- Yes.
It's fine.

"- What's your problem, bro?"
- Take that hand away.
"Lay a hand on that boy again, I'll rip your hand off."
"- They are just joking around, abi."
- They won't joke around from now on.
No one will raise a hand against this boy again.
No one will make him do their stuff from now on.
"- Abi, it's not a big deal."
- It is a big deal for me!
It is a big deal.
"What is going on, brother?"
What is your problem?
"You are my problem, dick heads."
I ruined my youth not to be like him.
- So that you won't have to see them again.- I will come.
I'm not scare of seeing them.
I will come and look into their eyes.
Deep into their eyes...
It's time.Let's go.
- Is the courthouse far from here?- No.
"- Has Mustafa come?- He must have, yes."
"- Does he know I am here?- No, are you scared of him?"
Don't be scared.He can't harm you as I'm here.
I am in İzmir.I came here for some business.
Sent by the companyto control a shipment.
How are you?
How is dad?
I may visit you once my work is done.
"I won't come thereif you don't want me, mom."
"Okay, okay."
I'm busy.
Let us not talk about it right now.
I'll call you later.
"Okay, see you later."
Which flight did you say?
Don't you have a sooner flight?
"Okay, book that ticket for me please."
"For 10 minutes, please.I'm on my way to the airport."
Help me out.
Please.
"I'm on my way to the airport.Yes, yes."
I'm trying to catch that flight.
"Okay, okay thanks."
- Fatmagül.- It's okay.
I'm fine.
"- Come, Kerim."
Why are you doing this?
Damn it!...
Damn it!...Damn it!
Damn ..
"Dalyan, I don't know how my son is."
Maybe he's dying.
I have to look into Mahir's eyes and ask for forgiveness...
Don't deprive me of this!
Don't deprive me of this!
"Thank you, my brother."
Come on.
Now stab me...
Then go to bed.
They will find me alone. as i don't want to bring any trouble to you.
"Hello, Kemal."
Why didn't you tell me that Mahir got shot?
I called you but you weren't there.
And how is he now?
"He's in the hospital, unconscious."
Who did it?
Did they arrest anyone?
No Abi.
No one got arrested.
"Ok, Ok."
Look Kibrit.
How much do you make out of rooster fights?
Is it enough?
I always find a way to make money.
"I should find a new way for you to make money, Kibrit."
You're right.
But all the ways are taken.
It's a heavy traffic.
I will after we do it once.
I feel so refreshed.
Thought I was gonna die.
"The dumber they are, the stronger they are."
What did you just say?!
What?
Are you yelling at me?
"I mean, what did you say?"
I said you're good.
I heard what you were saying.
Dammit!
I did you a favor.
What did you say!
You did me as a favor?
What a crap!
Where did you pick up such bad manners?
Don't you think you're going too far?
You're feeling pretty mighty all of a sudden.
It wasn't good because you were good.
It's because I was born sensitive.
"Still, aren't you being too hard on me?"
"Alright, brat."
Such pride...
If you only studied like that.
Dammit!
"Okay, okay."
Enough!
A man doesn't get pissed off over such things...

Somewhere Only We Know
"""Somewhere Only We Know"" is a song by English band Keane. It is their third single. The song is played using a piano, drums and bass. The song was the first single from the album ""Hopes and Fears"". The single was very popular in the United Kingdom and world wide."
Composition and recording.
"""Somewhere Only We Know"" was composed by Tim Rice-Oxley in 2001."
"The song was first played on the guitar, just before Dominic Scott left the band. It was recorded as a demo the same year with piano instead of the guitar. Keane recorded the final version in 2003 at the Helioscentric Studios, East Sussex for the album."
Keane played this song at the historical concert Live 8 in London.
Information of songs.
Somewhere Only We Know.
"The drummer for Keane, Richard Hughes, said that the band had been asked if the song was about a place. He said that Rice-Oxley had said that to the members of the band it might be about a place or a feeling. He also said that the song can mean something to each person and each person can relate the song to their own memories. He felt that the song was more of a theme than being about any single place or time."
"Look at the interview for this song, the place that only we know is when friends get High together."
The song is related to trees:
"The letters č, š, ž and dž are like the English sounds in ""ch""in, ""sh""in, vi""s""ion and ""j""uice."
"The letters ď, ľ, ň, and ť are called “soft consonants” and are pronounced with the blade of the tongue at the roof of the mouth."
"The letters c, dz and j are also soft, like ""ts"" in ba""ts"", ""ds"" in ro""ds"", and ""y"" in ""y""es."
"Signs over a vowel show that the vowel is pronounced long: á, é, í, ó, ý ú. A long vowel is never followed in the next syllable by a short vowel."
"The letter ô is like English ""wo""man, and ä is the same as the letter e."
"The letter ch is like ""ch"" in Scottish lo""ch"". V is more like English ""w""."
"The letters b, d, ď, dz, dž, g, h, z, ž are voiceless when they are at the end of a word (for example, 'd' will sound like 't')."
"The accent is always on the first syllable of the word. That is different from Russian, for example, in which the stress can be anywhere."
"Like other Slavic languages, Slovak is difficult for English-speakers to pronounce., especially because several consonants often come together. In the sentence: “Strč prst skrz krk!” there is not one single vowel (it means: “Stick a finger through your neck!”)!"
Grammar.
"The grammar is similar to Russian, but there are some differences. Slovak, unlike Russian, has a separate word for “to be”:"
"Unlike English, Slovak does not have articles (such as “the” and “a”)."
"There are three genders in Slovak, therefore it is important to know whether a noun is masculine, feminine or neuter. There is no article to make it obvious (unlike in German), but it changes the adjective's ending."
"Like many other European languages, Slovak verbs agree with the person, and there are different forms for 'I', 'you', 'he', etc. Verbs have different aspects to show whether or not the action is complete. There are also different cases that show how a word is used in a sentence. Different prepositions use different cases. All of that makes grammar quite complicated for English-speakers."
Sample words and phrases.
The numbers from 1 to 10 are .
"Use the familiar form when talking to a child, and the polite form when talking to an adult."

What it means.
"This eschatological parable follows the Olivet discourse in Luke 21:5-28 (and Matthew 24 and Mark 13). New buds appear on the branches of trees when Winter ends. The buds open into blossoms and green leaves in Spring. Fruit starts to appear as Summer arrives. When the signs of the end of the age start to happen, it means Jesus will return soon."
Counting the cost
Counting the cost is the name of a pair of parables Jesus told. The two parables are written in the New Testament in Luke 14:25-33.
What Jesus said.
"Large crowds were travelling with Jesus, and turning to them he said:"
What it means.
"The disciples of Jesus gave up everything they had for the kingdom of God, even their lives. To follow ""God's salvific aim"" meant to put family and possessions in second place. Christians believe the cost of being a disciple is worth the promised rewards."

The Parable of Drawing in the Net is a parable of Jesus written in the New Testament in Matthew 13:47–52. It is a parable about the final judgment. It is the seventh and last parable in the chapter which began with the Parable of the Sower.
What Jesus said.
The parable:
What it means.
"It is, like The Tares and the Wheat and The Sheep and the Goats, a parable about the final judgment. Here, the edible fish must be separated from the inedible fish after they caught with a net."
"Four of his disciples were fishermen and Jesus spoke using imagery they understood. Because it is a parable about the end of the age, a modern interpretation can be considered, with the net representing the Internet. Jesus's next words about old and new treasures indicated he did have in mind a future time. At that time, ""true teachers of the kingdom display the kingdom's treasure for all to see."""
Parable of the Faithful Servant
"The Parable of the Faithful Servant (or Parable of the Door Keeper) is a parable of Jesus written in the New Testament in Matthew 24:42-51, Mark 13:34-37, and Luke 12:35-48."
What Jesus said.
The parable:
What it means.
"The parable immediately precedes the Parable of the Ten Virgins in the Matthew 25. It means ""be prepared and remain alert."" The exact time of Jesus' Second Coming is unknown."
"The bridegroom is Jesus Christ. The wedding banquet is his wedding banquet. The advice is for the church, his bride, while she waits for him. He has chosen her. ""That privilege brings responsibility and that responsibility entails accountability."" Priests will be judged more severely than pagans who never heard of Jesus."
Parable of the Friend at Night
"The Parable of the Friend at Night (Importunate Neighbour), is a parable of Jesus written in the New Testament in Luke 11:5-8. A man refuses to help his neighbour during an emergency at midnight. His neighbour persists in asking until he changes his mind."
What Jesus said.
The parable:
"Based on the Parable of the Ten Virgins, the unexpected arrival of the neighbour's guest at midnight could mean it is Jesus himself."
What it means.
Hanamachi
"A hanamachi (花街) is a Japanese word used to call a neighborhood where courtesans and geisha lived and worked. The word's literal meaning is ""flower town"". These neighborhoods used to have many ""okiya"" (""geisha houses"") and ""ochaya"" (""tea houses"", where geishas entertained guests). The term ""hanamachi"" is used in modern Japan to call the areas where modern-day geisha are still living and working. Today, ""hanamachi"" are rare outside of Kyoto."
Japanese traditional dance
"There are two types of Japanese traditional dance: ""Odori"", which was created in the Edo period; and ""Mai"", which was created in the western part of Japan. Odori came from ""Kabuki"" drama, where it is danced by men. Mai derives from ""Noh"" drama, also danced by men. Today it is usually danced by female dancers, and is mostly done in houses, instead of on stage."
"A type of the Mai style of Japanese dance is the ""Kyomai"" or Kyoto style dance. Kyomai was created in the 17th century Tokugawa cultural period. Noh drama, music and dance was heavily influenced by the elegance of the manners of the Japanese Imperial Court. Kabuki drama, and hence Odori, was a more democratic form, but still (viewed with modern eyes) quite traditional."
Parkour
"Parkour is an activity in which the goal is to move from one place to another as quickly and efficiently as possible, using the abilities of the human body. Parkour helps to overcome barriers, and is practiced in rural and urban areas. Parkour practitioners are called ""traceurs"", or ""traceuses"" for females."
"Founded by David Belle in France, practitioners only use efficient movements to develop their bodies and minds, and to be able to overcome barriers in an emergency. It may also be a form of entertainment or a hobby."
"Acrobatics (such as flips and wall flips) are not part of parkour, because of inefficiency in a difficult situation (emergency). Freerunning is the branch of parkour, when such flips are used rather than efficient movement."
"In 1988, David Belle was 15 years old. His father Raymond Belle was a great fireman. David was influenced by his father. He left school at the age of 16 and his father helped him to make him stronger. David and his classmates began to create new actions to train themselves. They named it parkour."

Taxi
"A taxi (taxicab or cab in the United States) is a car, or other vehicle which is used for public transport. People use them to get to where they want to go. This means there are no stops in between where they get on and where they get off. Many big cities have taxis."
"In most other types of public transport, such as a bus, tram, or train, the rider does not get to choose the locations where they want to get picked up or dropped off. These vehicles often take certain roads or follow a very specific route. Because of this, they usually do not stop exactly where people want to go."
"Riding a taxi is a lot like having your own car, but you don't drive it. You only tell the taxi driver where you want to go and he or she will take you there. How much you pay for the ride, in most cases, depends on how far you are going from where you get on. It is common for the price for a taxi ride to be more expensive than other forms of transport."
History.
"The first taxi-type system started in Paris and London in the early 17th century. These were carts pulled by (carriages) and could be hired. The monarchies that ruled these cities controlled the rules. In the 19th century, Hansom cabs were mostly used because of their higher level of safety."

Stone fruit
"A stone fruit, also called a drupe, is a fruit with a large ""stone"" inside. The stone is sometimes called the seed, but that is a mistake, as the seed is inside the stone. The stones can also be called a pit. These fruits are edible and used frequently in cooking."
Identification.
What makes a fruit?
"A fruit is the matured ovary of a flower. Fruits consist of two main parts: the pericarp, or ovary wall, and the seed(s)."
"The pericarp has three layers: the exocarp (skin/rind), the mesocarp (bulk of the pericarp), and the endocarp (innermost layer)."
Berries vs. drupes.
"The two main classes of fleshy fruits are berries and drupes, or stone fruits."
"Berries have a fleshy mesocarp and endocarp, and may have multiple seeds."
"Drupes have a fleshy mesocarp, but a tough endocarp, and of course, a ""stone"" or ""pit"" at its center. Drupes typically have only a single seed."

Life history.
Humpback whales can live up to 45 years. They migrate between the places they feed in the winter and the places they give birth in the summer. They usually live alone.
Feeding.
"Humpback whales eat krill and small fish, for example herring, capelin, and sand lance. They scoop up their food in their large mouths. Sometimes they round up their prey by swimming in tight circles and blowing curtains of bubbles around them. They often hunt in small groups, called pods."
Whale song.
"The male whale is known to sing for up to 22 hours at a time. Because whales do not have vocal cords, they make songs by forcing air through their nasal passages. Every male has a different song. We don't yet know why they sing, it might be to call a female or scare away other males. The songs are made up of a pattern of low notes repeated over a period of hours or days. The whales slowly change their songs over a period of years."
Other sounds.
"Both the male and female humpback whales make other sounds, such as moans and grunts, to communicate with each other."

Pronunciation.
"Slovak is written using the Latin alphabet, but some letters have special signs (called diacritics)."
"As Chingphulon Konthousu grew up, she was known for her beauty and gentleness. She used to go to woods, lakes and open meadows for fun. One day, while Tampha was out in an open field with her friends, a strong wind blew. Tampha was lifted up by a whirlwind towards the sky. Her friends could do nothing but watch. The wind took her to heaven, the abode of Salailen. He was waiting for her."
"Tampha was unhappy about being far away from her parents and friends. To please her, Salailen promised her that the people of her native place would attain immortality and be safe from all diseases. Still, her parents, family and friends cried for the loss of her. Salailen told them that Tampha was safe with him. He told them about the promises he kept to her. Many years had passed and Salailen and Tampha had a son. She and Salailen named their son Khoriphaba."
"Tampha's parents wanted to see her. So they planned to meet her. Men went on a hunting expedition with their hunting dogs across the Thangjing Hills. Unfortunately, they could not catch even one animal. The tired hunters rested under the shade of a tree. Meanwhile, one of their favorite hunting dogs wandered away. The dog saw a large python sitting in sun. It barked at the python. The python killed it. Later, the hunters found the dead dog and carried it home. They prepared a funeral for the dog. The smoke from the funeral rose up towards the sky."
"Up in Heaven, Tampha saw the smoke rising from her native place. She knew it was for a funeral. She worried about her people. Perhaps someone had died even though Salailen had promised to keep them safe from disease. She asked Salailen about his promises. Salailen told her that the funeral was only for a dog. She did not believe him and wanted to see her parents. Reluctantly, Salailen allowed her to meet people under some conditions. She should leave only after their son Khoriphaba had gone to sleep and should come back before he woke up. Also, she should not consume any earthly foods or drinks. Then, he placed a golden ladder (or ""golden stairs"" in another version) for her to climb down. She landed on the Thangjing Hill and then went to Konthoujam, her native land. She met her near and dear ones. Her mother offered Tampha delicious foods."
"Tampha did not accept her mother's offers. However, her mother caught hold of her and tried to force her to eat. Tampha told her mother of the conditions with which she was leaving heaven to meet them on earth. Then, her mother arranged a shade with seven layers of false ceiling, enclosed by seven layers of drapery. Her plan was to block the vision of Salailen from above. Inside the shades, she served out delicious food for Tampha. Poor Tampha was compelled to eat what her mother had so lovingly prepared for her. But the God Salailen saw it happen even through the drapes. As Tampha started eating, Salailen proclaimed from heaven that she could not come back to his abode. He spat a blob of spit on her hand (or ""on her food"" in another version). The golden ladder (or ""golden stairs"" in another version) was also lifted up. Poor Tampha was abandoned from heaven. Salailen also took back his promises of immortality and immunity to disease."
"Later, she lived in the outskirts of Konthoujam. Since then, she came to be known as Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi."

Transport.
The main A38 road goes through Bromsgrove. The M5 motorway passes by the west side of the town. The M42 motorway starts at the north of the town.
"Bromsgrove train station is in the south of the town. The station is at the bottom of the ""Lickey Incline"". The Lickey Incline is the steepest hill for trains in Britain. An extra locomotive has to help push heavy freight trains up the hill. There are many passenger trains to Birmingham, Worcester and Hereford. There is a plan to build a new, better train station in Bromsgrove. The new station will cost about £10 million to £12 million."
There is also a bus station in the town centre. Buses travel from the bus station to many places in Worcestershire and the West Midlands.
Diploglossus
Diploglossus is a genus of lizards in the family Anguidae. It has nineteen described species. They are found in North and South America.
Graham's number
Graham's number is a very big natural number that was defined by a man named Ronald Graham. Graham was solving a problem in an area of mathematics called Ramsey theory. He proved that the answer to his problem was smaller than Graham's number.
"Graham's number is one of the biggest numbers ever used in a mathematical proof. Even if every digit in Graham's number were written in the tiniest writing possible, it would still be too big to fit in the observable universe."
Context.
Ramsey theory is an area of mathematics that asks questions like the following:
"It turns out that for this simple problem, the answer is ""yes"" when we have 6 or more points, no matter how the lines are colored. But when we have 5 points or fewer, we can color the lines so that the answer is ""no""."
"By asking that the 4 points lie on a plane, we have made the problem much harder. We would like to know: for what values of ""n"" is the answer ""no"" (for some way of coloring the lines), and for what values of ""n"" is it ""yes"" (for all ways of coloring the lines)? But this problem has not been completely solved yet."
"In 1971, Ronald Graham and B. L. Rothschild found a partial answer to this problem. They showed that for ""n""=6, the answer is ""no"". But when ""n"" is very large, as large as Graham's number or larger, the answer is ""yes""."
"One of the reasons this partial answer is important is that it means that the answer is eventually ""yes"" for at least some large ""n"". Before 1971, we didn't know even that much."
"There is a much smaller limit for the same problem called N. It is equal to formula_1, where formula_2. This weaker upper bound for the problem, attributed to an unpublished work of Graham, was eventually published and named by Martin Gardner in Scientific American in November 1977."
Definition.
"Graham's number is not only too big to write down all of its digits, it is too big even to write in scientific notation. In order to be able to write it down, we have to use Knuth's up-arrow notation."
"We will write down a sequence of numbers that we will call g1, g2, g3, and so on. Each one will be used in an equation to find the next. g64 is Graham's number."
"First, here are some examples of up-arrows:"
"After that, g2 is equal to formula_18; the number of arrows in this number is g1."
"g3 is equal to formula_19, where the number of arrows is g2."
"We keep going in this way. We stop when we define g64 to be formula_19, where the number of arrows is g63."
This is Graham's number.

History.
"Legends say that one day, an old man was taking care of his flock when an old lady called to him. She asked the man to get her some water to drink. The man said he would do this. He went to a nearby well and got water for the woman. The woman then asked him to take care of her hair. That night, the man had a dream. The woman appeared in his dream. She asked him to build a small temple for her. The next day, the man told his friends and neighbors about his dream. They set up a small hut and began to worship the woman as a goddess. People have believed that she chose this place because she thought it would be a good place to live. It is believed that the area had many types of trees. The area still has many trees today."
"The Dutch ruled the area in 1658. They ruled from 1658 until the British took control in 1796. During this time, a history book was written by A. Muthuthambipillai. The book says that Saravanamuthu Mudaliar was a Panchayat judge. It says that he held his court in a place now called 'Sathiyakadu'. This place was is in Tolpura at that time. With the permission of the Governor of Holland, a temple was built at Tolpura."
Architecture.
"According to documents from near the year 1650, the temple was built using burnt bricks. Laterm descendants of the original builders rebuilt the temple using stone. The cost of rebuilding the temole were paid for by the people of Valakkamparai in Tholpuram."
Special events.
The main religious festivals at the temple are celebrated during June or July. They include the Chariot Festival.
Wedding hall.
There is a large air-conditioned hall at the temple. It is used for the weddings of the Hindu people. The wedding hall can also be used for other activities. The hall can hold a maximum of 500 people. This hall started functioning in 2015.

"Akkrum belonged to the former municipality of Boarnsterhim until 2014, and to the municipality of Utingeradeel until 1984."
It has a railway station that connects Akkrum with Leeuwarden in the north and Heerenveen in the south. Motorway A32 is to the right of the village.
The village of Nes is just right of Akkrum.

Maruoka Castle
"Maruoka Castle (丸岡城, ""Maruoka-jō"") is in Sakai, Fukui Prefecture. It is also called Kasumi-ga-jō (霞ヶ城). The castle tower was built between 1624 to 1644. It is one of the twelve existing castle towers in Japan (現存十二天守, ""genzon-jūni-tenshu""), and also one of the national important cultural properties."
History.
"In 1576, Nobunaga Oda ordered Katsutoyo Shibata to build Maruoka Castle to get ready for the ikkō-ikki, a rebellion by believers of the Jōdo Shinshū sect of Buddhism in the 15th-16th centuries. In 1613, Narushige Honda became the first lord, castle owner, of the Maruoka Castle. After the Honda family, the Arima family were lords of Maruoka Castle from 1695 to 1869. Shigesumi Arima was lord from 1772 to 1830. He rebuilt the local domain economy. On 8 July 1948,  an earthquake hit Fukui. The quake destroyed the castle tower of Maruoka Castle. But, in 1955 the castle tower was repaired by recycling more than 70% of the original materials of Maruoka Castle."
Structure.
"Maruoka Castle’s stone walls are about 6.2 meters high. The stone walls were built using ""nozura-zumi"" (野面積み), an architectural method to build stone walls with a good system of drains. This protects the building from damage by heavy rain. Maruoka Castle is also famous for its steep stairs. The stairs that go up from the first floor to the second floor are at an angle of 65 degrees. The stairs from the second floor to the third floor are at an angle of 67 degrees."
Events.
Cherry Blossom Festival.
"About 400 cherry trees were planted around Maruoka Castle, and this place was chosen as one of the Japan’s Top 100 Cherry Blossom Viewing Sites in 1990. There is a Cherry Blossom Festival there every year."
"""A Brief Message From the Heart "" Letter Contest (一筆啓上賞, ""ippitsukeijō-shō"")."
"Shigetsugu Honda, whose son was the first lord of Maruoka Castle, sent a letter to his wife during a war at Shitaragahara in 1575."
"""A brief message. Don't start a fire. Don't make Osen cry. Feed my horses."""
"This letter is said to be famous for the shortest letter in Japan, and there is a stone monument engraved with this letter in Maruoka Castle. In 1993, this contest was started to let more people know that the shortest letter was in Maruoka Castle."

Kate Smith really sold a song
I don't know just what went wrong
those were the days!
"In 1975 Rob Reiner, Sally Struthers, Jean Stapleton, and Carroll O'Connor sung ""Those were the Days"" but changed the name to ""These are the days."" The song was for the live audience but was not but on television. The lyrics were different and it was about what was currently going on and realizing the changes. This was the only time that Reiner and Struthers were also singing with Stapleton and O'Connor."
Remembering You.
"""Remembering You"" was the closing theme song for ""All in the Family"". The song would play after each episode had ended and the credits were being shown. The song was composed by Roger Kellaway. The lyrics were never added to the show but Carroll O'Connor did sing them when he was an television. During the song the clips from ""Those were the Days"" would play but instead it would be backwards. It used to just be a piano playing but lyrics sung by Archie Bunker actor, Carroll O'Connor were added. In the episode ""Stewie Loves Lois"" of ""Family Guy"" this song was played for the end credits:"
"Got a feelin' it's all over now - All over now, we're through."
"And tomorrow I'll be lonesome, Remembering You."
Got a feelin' the sun will be gone - The day will be long and blue.
"And tomorrow I'll be cryin', Remembering You."
"There'a far away look in your eye when you try to pretend to me,"
That everything is the same as it used to be.
"I see it's all over now - All over now, we're through."
And tomorrow I'll be startin' Remembering You.

Toe socks are socks that wrap each toe separate from the others. Socks can be worn on the feet. Socks come in an array of different colors. Generally, white socks are worn for everyday or athletic use, and dark socks (black, brown, gray, or navy blue) are worn with business or formal wears. Some dress socks have patterns on them; these are called ""argyles""."

History.
Early history.
Mandalay was started by King Mindon. He started the city on 13 February 1857. He built Mandalay as the new capital city of the Kingdom of Burma.
Mindon's city was in size. There were rivers on each side. It had 144 square blocks in a grid. In the middle was a palace that was 16 square blocks in size.
The palace had four walls that were each long. Around the walls was a moat that was wide and deep. Each wall had turrets (towers) for watchmen. These turrets were placed every . Each turret had a spire made of gold. Each side had three gates and five bridges across the moat.
"The king also built some other buildings in the city. These buildings were the Kuthodaw Pagoda, the ""Pahtan-haw Shwe Thein"" upasampada hall, the ""Thudamma"" ""Good Dharma"" zayats (), and a library for the Pāli Canon. A ""zayat"" is a building where Buddhism is taught."
"In June 1857, the king moved the royal palace to Mandalay. The palace had been in Amarapura. The building was taken apart. Each piece was moved by elephants to Mandalay. The palace was put back together and finished on 23 May 1859. The palace is now at the bottom of Mandalay Hill."
"Mandalay was the capital for 26 years. It was the last royal capital of the Konbaung Dynasty. (The Konbaung Dynasty were the last rulers of the Kingdom of Burma before it was taken over by the British Empire.) On 28 November 1885, the British conquered Burma. This ended the Third Anglo-Burmese War. King Thibaw Min and Queen Supayalat were sent into exile."
Mandalay in British Burma (1885-1948).
Mandalay was still an important city in British Burma. The city of Rangoon became the capital of Burma.
"The British wanted to make Mandalay an important commercial city. They did not want it to be important for politics, education, or other reasons. Mandalay was connected to Yangon by railroad in 1889. The first college in Mandalay wasn't built until 1925."
The royal palace was looted by the British. All of the treasures were stolen. Some treasures can be seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The British changed the name of the palace to Fort Dufferin. British soldiers used the palace as a barracks (a place to camp.)
"Mandalay was the most important city for Burmese culture during the time the British were in charge. It was also the most important place for Buddhist learning. The Burmese people saw Mandalay as a symbol. Between World War I and World War II, there were many protests in Mandalay against the British."
"During the time the British were in charge, many people moved to Mandalay from India. (India was also a British colony.) From 1904 to 1905, a plague happened. About one third of the people of Mandalay left to get away from the disease."
"During World War II, Mandalay was bombed by the Japanese. The British moved all of their airplanes to India. Mandalay had no defenses against the Japanese air raids. On 3 April 1942, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service bombed the city. Three-fifths (3/5) of the houses were destroyed. More than 2,000 civilians (people who are not military) were killed."
The Japanese soon invaded Burma. The Imperial Japanese Army took over the city of Mandalay. They were in charge from May 1942 until March 1945. The palace citadel was made into a supply depot. (A supply depot is a building that stores supplies like food and machines.)
The Allied forces bombed the city after the Japanese took it over. Much of the palace was destroyed. Only the royal mint and watch tower were not destroyed. The palace was rebuild in the 1990s.
Mandalay today (1948 - now).
"In 1948, the British left Burma. Mandalay was still the most important city for culture, education, and commerce in Upper Burma."
"Until the 1990s, most students went to university in Mandalay. Until 1991, there were only three universities in Upper Burma: Mandalay University, The University of Medicine, Mandalay, and the Defense Services Academy. All of these universities are in Mandalay. Only some other cities had schools called ""Degree Colleges."" These were small schools that were part of Mandalay University. These colleges had classes in a small number of subjects."
"From 1962 to 1988, Ne Win was in charge of the government. He was very isolationist. This means that he did not want Myanmar to be part of global trade or tourism. In the 1980s, Mandalay was the second biggest city in Myanmar. It looked like a town with low buildings, dusty streets, and more bicycles than cars."
"During the 1980s, there were two big fires. In May 1981, a fire destroyed more than 6,000 buildings. 36,000 people were left homeless. On 24 March 1984, there was another fire. This fire destroyed 2,700 buildings. 23,000 more people were made homeless."
"Fires are still a big problem. In February 2008, there was another big fire in Mandalay. It destroyed the Yadanabon Market. This was the second-biggest market in the city. In February 2009, a fire destroyed 320 houses. More than 1,600 people were made homeless."
"The fires during the 1980s destroyed a lot of buildings. This made a lot of land empty. Many Chinese people in Burma bought this land. A lot of these people had come from Yunnan in China. Many Chinese people came to Upper Burma and Mandalay from Yunnan and Sichuan in the 1990s. 250,000 to 350,000 people from Yunnan came to Mandalay in the 1990s. Today, about 30% to 40% of the people of Mandalay are Chinese. The native Burmese people complain that Mandalay is now like a part of China."
"The Chinese have rebuilt the parts of the city that burned down. They built apartment buildings, hotels, and shopping centers. They helped make Mandalay again an important city for trade and commerce. It now connects trade for Upper Burma, Lower Burma, China, and India."
Mandalay has grown much bigger over time. It now includes what used to be Amarapura. (Amarapura was where King Mindon's capital city used to be before he moved it to Mandalay.) Mandalay celebrated its 150th birthday on 15 May 2009 at 4:31:36 am.
Important places.
There are many important places and buildings in Mandalay.
Mandalay Palace.
The royal palace in Mandalay is a very important building. A lot of it was burned down during World War II. The royal mint and watch tower did not burn down. The rest of the buildings were rebuilt.

Gameplay.
"Two players competed. At the start, a computer image of the ""Scrabble"" board was shown. A letter would be given in the center space. The host told the players the number of letters in the word, and then read a clue to the word. The player would take two numbered tiles. These tiles were placed in a slot, giving the player two letters. The player would then choose a letter to place in the word. If the letter was in the word, it was placed into the word. The player then made a guess to the word or placed the other tile. If the player could not guess the word after placing the tile, they took two more tiles. Play continued until the player guessed the word (done by the player hitting their buzzer) or there was only one letter left in the word. If a correct guess was made, the player won the word. If an incorrect guess was made, play passed to the other player. Three words won the game. Two games were played with two different players."
"Three of the letters were ""Stoppers,"" a letter that was not in the word. If one of those letters were chosen, the player lost their turn."
"Some of the letters were placed into blue and pink squares. If the player guessed the word after placing a letter into one of these squares, they won a bonus. A blue square was worth $500, while a pink square was worth $1,000 to Count Money"
"If all three stoppers were chosen, there was a 2-2 tie, or time was running short, Speedword was played. In Speedword, each letter in the word was revealed one at a time. The first player to buzz in with a correct guess won the word. 3 Stoopers 1 or 2"
Scrabble Sprint.
"The two winning players of the main game played in the Scrabble Sprint. Here, the winners of the two games competed to guess four words in the fastest time. The four words were six, seven, eight, and nine letters long. The winner of the first game played first. For each word, the player was told the number of letters in the word, and then was given a clue. When the host said to start, the clock started counting up. The player was given two letters, and selected one to place in the word. When the player wanted to guess the word, they hit a buzzer and made their guess. If correct, they moved on to the next word. If incorrect, ten seconds was added to their time, and they had to play another word of the same length. Once the player guessed all four words, the clock stopped. This set the time for the second player to beat."
"The second player played with the same four words. This time around, the clock counted down. If the second player got all four words within this time, the player won. If not, the first player won."
Bonus Sprint.
"The winner of the Scrabble Sprint moved on to the Bonus Sprint. Here, the player had to get two words within ten seconds. The rules were the same as the Scrabble Sprint. If the player got both words, they won a jackpot that started at $5,000 and increased by $1,000 each day that it was not won."

This is done by tapping and holding the screen in order to make the bird dive. The game play mainly revolves around timing your taps so that the bird goes down hills and flies up them. The game's day trip version is separated into several islands, which have different layouts and change every 24 hours. The game features special goals that allow players to upgrade their nest, which adds a score multiplier usually X2. These challenges go around reaching specific islands or performing certain tricks a number of times in one game. The game's visuals change daily along with the islands' layouts."

William Taylor Adams
"William Taylor Adams (July 30, 1822 – March 27, 1897), was an American writer and children's magazine editor. He used the pen name ""Oliver Optic"". Adams was born in Medway, Massachusetts."
"In 1853, he wrote his first novel, ""Hatchie, the Guardian Slave"". Adams taught in the Boston public schools for many years. While teaching, he discovered what kinds of books boys liked best.

They also threw away the books of other boys' writers. Adams kept writing boys' books though. He got good reviews from the critics. His books sold well. They were reprinted many times.
"Alameda, California"
Alameda is a city in California.
History.
The city was founded in 1853 as 3 smaller towns. At the west end it was called Woodstock. The east end was called Fernside. In the 1940s the land was filled to make Bay Farm Island.
Three Kingdoms.
"Between 57 BC and the year 668 there were three kingdoms in the Korean Peninsula and Manchuria. The names of the kingdoms were: Silla, Goguryeo and Baekje. In the year 372, the religion Buddhism came from China to Korea. Buddhism was very important in Korea."
"In the year 660, the kingdom of Silla invaded the kingdom of Baekje. In the year 668 the kingdom of Silla invaded the kingdom of Goguryeo. The people of Goguryeo ran away and made a new kingdom with the name Balhae. After a little time, the kingdom of Balhae was invaded by Liao Dynasty."
"When Silla was the only country, it had the name Unified Silla. In the Silla kingdom Buddhism was very important."
The northern and southern kingdoms.
"In the year 698, Balhae was founded by allies of Goguryeo. We call the time when united Silla and Balhae were existing together (698∼926) ""The northern and southern kingdoms period""."
Goryeo.
In the year 918 the kingdom of Goryeo began. The name Korea comes from Goryeo. The kingdom of Goryeo had power until the year 1392.
"The kingdom of Goryeo wrote the law in books, and had a big government. Buddhism was very important in the kingdom of Goryeo. Bronze-type printing technology was invented in Goryeo Dynasty. This is known as the world's oldest bronze-type printing technology."
"The Mongol empire conquered Goryeo and forced Korea to pay a tribute in Korean girls and eunuchs to the Mongol court with about 500,000 Korean girls and eunuchs taken to Yuan China. Mongol and Central Asian Semu Hui Tammachi army officials in Korea itself also took Korean women as concubines and Korea officials complained about it, begging the Mongol court to withdraw them from Korea. Koreans wrote erotic songs about how Korean women were seduced by Central Asian Muslims in their bakeries."
"An amusing incident is reported as having occurred about this time. A courtier named Pa-gyu observed to the king, “The male population of the country has been decimated but there are still plenty of women. For this reason it is that the Mongols take so many of them. There is danger that the pure Koryŭ stock will become vitiated by the intermixture of wild blood. The king should let each man take several wives and should remove the restrictions under which the sons of concubines labor."" When the news of this came to the ears of the women they were up in arms, as least the married portion ; and each one read to her spouse such a lecture that the subject was soon dropped as being too warm to handle. When the king passed through the streets with Pa-gyu in his retinue the women would point to the latter and say “There goes the man who would make concubines of us all."""
Joseon.
"In the year 1392 a man from the military of Korea went to China. His name was Yi Seonggye. His job was to attack Yuan China. But he returned without doing it. When he came back to Korea, he changed the kingdom. He became king."
"The name of the kingdom was Joseon. In the year 1394, the people of Joseon moved the capital to Seoul. The religion of Buddhism was not important. A new religion, Confucianism was important. Confucianism came from China."
In the year 1443 King Sejong ruled Joseon. He invented the Korean alphabet Hangeul.
"In the year 1592 and the year 1598 the people from Japan fought Korea. A man from the military made very strong ships, including the famous turtle ship. The name of the man was Yi Sun-sin. With the strong ships, the people of Korea won."
The people of Joseon were friends with the people of China.
"Today, North Koreans use the name Joseon (officially Chosŏn) to mean Korea."
19th century.
In the 19th century the people of Korea did not want to trade with other people. People called Korea Hermit Kingdom.
"The people of the United States and Japan wanted to trade with Korea. Before 1876, people failed when they tried to use force to trade with Korea. In the year 1876 the military of Japan fought Korea. Korea and Japan made a contract to trade."
"In 1895 Japan won the First Sino-Japanese War in the Korean peninsula. This ended Chinese influence in Korea. Empress Myeongseong, also called Queen Min, wanted the Russian Empire as a friend, to help Korea against Japan. Agents of the Ambassador of Japan killed her in October 1895."
"In 1905 Japan won the Russo-Japanese War. In the year 1910, the emperor of Japan made Korea a colony of Japan."
Colony of Japan to today.
Korea was occupied by Japan from 1910 to 1945.
"When World War II started, the policy of the Japanese government changed. The government made the religion of Japan (Shinto) the religion of Korea."
In 1945 Japan lost World War II. The United States and Soviet Union made a contract. United States occupied the south of Korea and Soviet Union occupied the north of Korea.
The people of Korea wanted to be independent. The United States and the Soviet Union agreed the people of Korea would be free and independent. But soon the United States and Soviet Union were not friends and the Cold War started. United States and Soviet Union refused to settle a deal. In 1948 the people in the south made an independent country called South Korea (also called the Republic of Korea). The United States helped them. In 1948 the people in the north also made a country North Korea (also called the DPRK or Democratic People's Republic of Korea). The Soviet Union helped North Korea.
"In 1950 a war started in Korea. The name of the war was the Korean War. The war ended in 1953, but no peace treaty was signed. The border line between North and South was almost the same in the end as it was before the war."
English as a second language
"English as a second language is a common phrase which has related acronyms, including"
"In some countries, most notably where the weather is warm, there is a tradition to take a nap right after noon, or early in the afternoon. This tradition is called siesta, and is most common in Spain and Latin America. Some stores and services close while their owners and/or employees take their siesta."
Word.
"The word ""sleep"" comes from the old Old Germanic verbs for sleep. In Old and Middle High German, it was called ""SLAF"". The original meaning of the word was ""to slap"", which was related to the word for ""flabby"" (not hard or firm)."
"Many words related to ""sleep"" have very different meanings. For example, ""sleep"" may be used to mean death, so that ""putting an animal to sleep"" means to kill the animal without pain. ""Sleep with someone"" can also have a sexual meaning."
What sleep is for.
"Sleep helps the brain function. The details are not fully understood, but it is important to get enough sleep for the body and the brain to be healthy and to work properly. In general, animals (and people) sleep at periodic intervals, such as once a day. Certain animals send out signals to the others that they will soon go to sleep. Yawning is such a signal."
"Both humans and many animals sleep about once a day. Some animals, such as cats, sleep many times a day for short periods up to 15 hours a day (or even longer)."
"When people sleep, they often have dreams. Probably some animals do, too."
"Not only people sleep, but all mammals and birds, and most fish, reptiles and other animals also too."
Brief stages of sleep.
There are four stages during sleep:
"While humans sleep, REM and NREM are sleep patterns that help with long-term memory, remembering information, procedural memory, and creative thinking."
Different types of sleep.
REM sleep.
"In mammals and birds, sleep can be divided into two categories. In one of them, the eyes move rapidly. It is called REM-sleep (rapid eye movement). Most dreams take place in this phase. as the body becomes relaxed and the eyes move while sleeping. This phase helps prepare one for the next day. REM-sleep occurs normally at intervals throughout the night, and the periods of REM-sleep increase in length in the second half of the night. It is often encountered 90 minutes after falling asleep, and continues to occur every 90 minutes. REM-sleep was first discovered in 195253."
"REM sleep is found in mammals and songbirds, but is ""poorly established"" in reptiles and fish. According to a survey:"
NREM sleep.
"The other category, where this movement of the eyes does not happen, is called NREM-sleep (Non-REM sleep). In general, dreams do not occur during this time. There are three or four stages of NREM-sleep. Stage I is just barely sleeping, or dozing. Stage II is also light sleep. Normally, in adult humans, about half of the time spent asleep is spent in light sleep. Stages III and IV are called deep sleep. Deep sleep is necessary for growth and healing. It can be quite difficult to awaken someone who is in stage III or stage IV sleep. Sometimes, stages III and IV are combined and called stage III."
"Adult humans normally sleep in cycles of 90 to 110 minutes each. The night's sleep can be 4 or 5 of these cycles. Each cycle includes, in this order: stage I, stage II, stage III (IV), and REM."
Getting enough sleep.
"People who regularly get less than 8 hours of sleep a night tend to complain more and feel very fatigued throughout the day. Getting the appropriate amount of sleep is extremely important, as it could affect one’s body and increase the chances of serious health problems. For each age group, there are different amounts of sleep that are recommended:"
- Toddlers (4 to 12 months): 12 to 16 hours (w/ naps)
- Toddlers (1–2 years): 11 to 14 hours (w/ naps)
- Preschoolers (3–5 years): 10 to 13 hours (w/ naps)
- Grade Schoolers (6 to 12 years): 9 to 12 hours
- Teenagers(13–18 years): 8 to 10 hours
- Adults (including old age): 7 to 9 hours
The timing of sleep and the amount of it are both important. Both are different for different people. Some adults sleep best from 22:00 to 05:00 or 06:00 or 07:00. Some sleep best from midnight to seven or eight. These variations are normal.
"How much sleep is enough also depends on age. Children need more sleep than adults. Newborn babies sleep about 18 hours per day. Small babies sleep many times a day; human babies do not develop circadian rhythms before they are 3 – 4 months old. At the age of 1 year, they sleep for about 14 hours."
"A nine-year-old should sleep about 9–10 hours per day and teenagers, too, also need that much sleep. Adults who sleep less than about 8 hours a day perform worse than those who sleep that long."
Bad habits.
Poor habits could affect one’s sleep schedule in many ways without taking notice. A few habits that are very common and ruin sleep are:
"Hemingway's sentences were short, the way he had been taught to write at the Kansas City Star newspaper. He wrote about what he knew and felt. He used few descriptive words. His statements were clear and easily understood."
"He had learned from earlier writers, like Ring Lardner and Sherwood Anderson, but Hemingway brought something new to his writing. He was able to paint in words what he saw and felt. In later books, sometimes he missed. Sometimes he even looked foolish. But when he was right he was almost perfect."
Marriage with Pauline Pfeiffer.
"With the success of his novel, Hemingway became even more popular in Paris. Many people came to see him. One was an American woman, Pauline Pfeiffer. She became Hadley's friend. Then Pauline fell in love with Hemingway."
"Hemingway and Pauline saw each other secretly. One time, they went away together on a short trip. Years later, Hemingway wrote when he returned that ""...I wished I had died before I ever loved anyone but her. She was smiling and the sun was on her lovely face."""
"But they wouldn't stay married. Hadley knew Hemingway was also in love with Pfeiffer. Hemingway was seeing her in secret, even though he was married with Pauline. Because of this, Ernest Hemingway and Hadley separated. She kept their son. He agreed to give her money he earned from his books. In later years, he said that his marriage to Hadley as the happiest time of his life."
"At twenty-five, Hemingway was living in Paris. He was a famous writer. But the end of his first marriage made him want to leave the place where he had first become famous. Much later he said, ""the city was never to be the same again. When I returned to it, I found it had changed as I had changed. Paris was never the same as when I was poor and very happy."""
"Hemingway and his new wife returned to the United States in 1928. They settled in Key West, an island with a fishing port near the southern coast of Florida."
His well-known books.
"Before leaving Paris, Hemingway sent a collection of his stories to New York to be published. The book of stories, called ""Men Without Women"", was published soon after Hemingway arrived in Key West."
The Killers.
"One of the stories was called ""The Killers."" In it, Hemingway used a discussion between two men to create a feeling of tension and coming violence. This was a new way of telling a story. Here is an example:Nick opened the thingy and went into the room. Ole Andreson was lying on the bed with all his clothes on. He had been a heavyweight prizefighter and he was too long for the bed. He lay with his head on two pillows. He did not look at Nick."
"""What was it?"" He asked."
"""I was up at Henry's,"" Nick said, ""and two fellows came in and tied me up and the cook, and they said they were going to kill you."""
"It sounded silly when he said it. Ole Andreson said nothing, ""they put us out in the kitchen,"" Nick went on. ""They were going to shoot you when you came in to supper."""
"Ole Andreson looked at the wall and did not say anything. ""George thought I ought to come and tell you about it."""
"""There is not anything I can do about it,"" Ole Andreson said."
"Any new book by Hemingway was an important event for readers. But stories like ""The Killers"" shocked many people. Some thought there was too much violence in his stories. Others said he only wrote about gunmen, soldiers, fighters, and drinkers."
This made Hemingway angry. He felt that writers should not be judged by those who could not write a story.
"Hemingway was happy in Key West. In the morning he wrote, in the afternoon he fished, and at night he went to a public house and drank. One old fisherman said: ""Hemingway was a man who talked slowly and very carefully. He asked a lot of questions. And he always wanted to get his information exactly right."""
A Farewell to Arms.
"Soon afterwards, he heard that his father had killed himself. Hemingway was shocked. He said, ""My father taught me so much. He was the only one I really cared about."""
When Hemingway returned to work there was a sadness about his writing that was not there before.
"His new book told about an American soldier who served with the Italian army during World War One. He meets an English nurse, and they fall in love. They flee from the army, but she dies during childbirth. Some of the events are taken from Hemingway's service in Italy. The book is called ""A Farewell to Arms""."
"Part of the book talks about the defeat of the Italian army at a place called Caporetto:""At noon we were stuck in a muddy road about as nearly as we could figure, ten kilometres from Udine. The rain had stopped during the forenoon and three times we had heard planes coming, seen them pass overhead, watched them go far to the left and heard them bombing on the main highroad. . . .""Later we were on a road that led to a river. There was a long line of abandoned trucks and carts on a road leading up to a bridge. No one was in sight. The river was high and the bridge had been blown up in the center; the stone arch was fallen into the river and the brown water was going over it. We went up the bank looking for a place to cross. . . . we did not see any troops; only abandoned trucks and stores. Along the river bank was nothing and no one but the wet brush and muddy ground. """
Death in the Afternoon.
"""A Farewell to Arms"" was very successful. It earned Hemingway a lot of money. Because of this money, he could travel to other places."
"One place he visited was Spain, a country he loved. He said, ""I want to paint with words all the sights and sounds and smells of Spain. And if I can write any of it down truly, then it will represent all of Spain."""
"He wrote a book called ""Death in the Afternoon"". It describes the Spanish custom of bull fighting. Hemingway believed that bull fighting was an art, just as much as writing was an art. And he believed it was a true test of a man's bravery, something that always concerned him."
The Snows of Kilimanjaro.
"Hemingway also travelled to Africa. He had been asked to write a series of reports about African hunting. He said, ""Hunting in Africa is the kind of hunting I like. No riding in cars, just simple walking and feeling the grass under my feet."""
"The trip to Africa resulted in a book called ""The Green Hills of Africa"" and many smaller stories."
An inquest into Duggan's death began on 16 September 2013. On 8 January 2014 a jury decided that his death was a lawful killing. It was decided that it was lawful because the police officer who shot Duggan told the jury he believed that Duggan was holding a gun and was going to shoot it. Witness B said that Duggan was not holding a gun. He said that Duggan was holding a mobile phone. There was a gun in a sock 10–14 feet away from where Duggan was shot. The sock and the gun did not have Duggan's DNA on them. Duggan's family were angry about the jury's verdict.
On 11 January there was a vigil for Duggan outside Tottenham police station. Hundreds of prostesters were there.
Background.
Tension with police.
There was tension between black people and the police in Tottenham before and since the Broadwater Farm riot in 1985.
Duggan.
"Duggan was born on 15 September 1981 to a white mother, Pamela Duggan, and a black father, Bruno Hall. He grew up in Broadwater Farm. At age 13, he left home to live with one of his maternal aunts in Manchester. Duggan had three children with his partner Semone Wilson at the time of his death, as well as three other children by other women."
"After his death police and other people said that he was a drug dealer. His family and friends said that he was not. Tony Thompson of the ""London Evening Standard"" wrote that Duggan may have been one of the first members of North London's ""Star Gang"". Duggan's family said that ""He was not a gang member and he had no criminal record."" Duggan had been convicted of having cannabis in 2000 and having things that he knew had been stolen in 2007. ""The Daily Mail"" said that he had also been arrested many times. The things he was arrested for included the murder of Gavin Smith and attempted murder. He was not charged with the murder of Smith because there was not enough evidence."
In March 2011 Duggan's cousin had been stabbed to death at a nightclub. Some people said that this made Duggan want to carry a gun.
"Duggan was under investigation by Operation Trident. ""Trident have jammed me,"" he wrote in a text message minutes before his death."
Shooting.
"Officers of the Metropolitan Police Service stopped a cab that was carrying Duggan as a passenger at about 6:15pm on 4 August 2011. They did this because they had been told that Duggan had a gun. A firearms officer said that Duggan got out of the cab and pulled a gun from his waistband. He then ran away. Police shot him twice. An eyewitness said that Duggan ""was shot while he was pinned to the floor by police."" Paramedics came, but he died before he could be taken to hospital. A 9mm gun was found 10–14 feet away from where Duggan was shot on the other side of the fence. Witnesses told the IPCC that they saw police throw the gun over the fence."
Aftermath.
Police waited a day and a half to tell Duggan's family to tell them that Duggan was dead.
Riots.
The 2011 riots started with the peaceful protest of Duggan's death.
"At about 5:30pm on 6 August 2011, Duggan's family and people living in the area marched from Broadwater Farm to Tottenham Police Station. They chanted ""we want answers"". Around 8pm a 16-year-old girl was beaten by police with a baton. A witness said that she had thrown something at the police. Around 8:20pm members of a crowd waiting to speak to a police officer set fire to two police cars. The next day people rioted in other areas of London. Most of the rioters were young men. On August 9 a man died after being shot in Croydon on August 8. On August 10 three men were killed in a hit-and-run. A man died on 8 August from injuries from an attack by a mob. By 15 August 2011, about 3,100 people had been arrested."
Media coverage.
"Duggan's death quickly became a big news story. Duggan was called a 'gangster' and a 'thug' by the ""Daily Mail"". On September 8 2011 an article by Martin Samuda, a friend of Duggan, was published in ""The Guardian"". Duggan's brother Shaun Hall also wrote an article for ""The Guardian"" in September 2013 which said that Duggan's family did not trust the police anymore."
Funeral.
On 9 September 2011 there was a funeral for Duggan. Thousands of people were there.
Father's death.
In 2012 Duggan's father died from cancer.
Inquest.
A public inquest into Duggan's death started on 16 September 2013. The jury learned that Duggan had been killed by a 9mm hollow-point round. A hollow-point bullet. Two witnesses said that they saw a police officer move something from the minicab to the place where the gun was found. Duggan's lawyers argued that police had put the gun found near where Duggan was killed there to make Duggan's killing look lawful. The officer who killed Duggan said Duggan was still holding a gun when both shots were fired. 9 of the jury decided that Mark Duggan threw the firearm on to the grass.
Protests.
On 11 December 2013 students protested outside the Royal Courts of Justice during the inquest.
Verdict.
On 8 January 2014 the jury decided that Duggan's death had been a lawful killing. People living in Tottenham said that there may be more riots because of this.
Prince of Condé
"The title of Prince of Condé was a title used in France while the country was a monarchy For example prior to 1793. The holder of the title was a member of the extended royal family and therefore held the rank and further title of prince of the blood and the style of Serene Highness but the style was only used when in writing. The holder of the title also held the important further rank of First Prince of the blood. The heir was usually given the title of Duke of Bourbon and at other times the Duke of Enghien. The title was ""only"" to be inherited by the male line as females were expelled from to succeeding to titles. The title existed for almost two centuries and during that time the prince was one of the highest ranking prince behind that of the actual royal family."

Floppy disk
"The floppy disk (or a 3 1/2 floppy for today's standard) is a removable magnetic storage medium. Floppy disks are used for moving information between computers, laptops or other devices. Some early digital cameras, electronic music instruments and older computer game consoles use floppy disks. Floppy disks are inserted in to a floppy disk drive or simply floppy drive to allow data to be read or stored."
Floppy disks store much less data than a CD-ROM disk or USB flash drive. A normal 3 inch disk can store 1.44 megabytes of data. This is usually enough for simple text documents.
"A special type of floppy disk was made in the late 1980s. It could store 2.88 MB of data. They did not become popular. Larger size floppy disks became available in the 1990s. The two most popular were the Zip drive and the Jaz drive, both made by Iomega."
"Floppy disk technology has been around since the early 1970s (the 8-inch floppy was the first). Today, floppy disks have been replaced by other storage media, like USB flash drives. Floppy disks and drives are no longer manufactured, but are still widely-available as new old stock."
The floppy drive.
"A floppy drive (often called drives “A” and “B” on a computer running DOS or Windows) can be connected to or installed in a personal computer (PC). It is the part of a computer that reads and writes the disk that can be removed. A disk, often called a ""floppy disk"", is used to store files and carry them from one computer to another by using the floppy drive. The floppy drive reads the disk (or diskette) and the user is then able to open and change the files saved on the disk."
Nat King Cole
"Nathaniel Adams Coles, professionally known as Nat King Cole, (March 17, 1919 - February 15, 1965) was an American jazz musician, singer and songwriter. He was born in the southern city of Montgomery, Alabama. His father was a Christian minister. Millions of Nat King Cole’s recordings were sold while he was alive. He died of lung cancer in February, 1965, when he was forty-five years old. People around the world still enjoy listening to the music of one of America’s greatest performers of popular and jazz music."
Early years.
"When Cole was four years old, his parents moved the family to North Chicago, Illinois. His younger brother was Freddy Cole. He learned to play the piano when he was very young. His mother was the only piano teacher he ever had. He gave his first public performance when he was four. By the time he was twelve, Cole was playing piano at his father’s church. His father was pastor of the First Baptist church in North Chicago, Illinois for 29 years."
His interest in jazz.
"Cole played piano in New York City and Los Angeles, California when he was a young man. In 1937, he formed a group that played jazz music. Oscar Moore played the guitar and Wesley Prince played the bass. The trio reportedly did not need a drummer because Cole’s piano playing kept the beat so well. They named the group, The King Cole Trio. At the same time, Cole also changed his name into Nat King Cole. The trio soon became very popular. Nat sang some songs, but mostly played the piano."
Well-known popular singer.
"By the middle 1940s, Nat King Cole was beginning to be known as a popular singer as well as a jazz piano player. He was one of the first musicians to record with new Capitol Records."
"The first song he recorded for Capitol was “Straighten Up and Fly Right.” He wrote the song. The words were based on his father’s teachings. The song became one of the biggest hits of 1943. It sold more than 500,000 copies."
"Nat recorded hundreds of songs. Some of the most popular include “Sweet Lorraine,” “Nature Boy,” “Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer,” “When I Fall in Love,” and “Mona Lisa.” In 1950, the American film industry gave him an award for his recording of “Mona Lisa.” That song made him famous as a singer."
"Nat King Cole also acted in movies. The best known one is ""Saint Louis Blues"". He played the part of the jazz composer W.C. Handy. He also appeared in a movie about himself called ""The Nat King Cole Story""."
"In the 1950s, he sang with some of the best known orchestras of the time."
He received many awards during his life. He also received many more after his death. One was a 1990 Grammy Award for lifetime achievement.
His success as a black man.
"By 1956, Nat King Cole was known internationally. He signed an agreement to perform at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada."
Cole often performed in places that only admitted white people. Black leaders did not like this about him. Cole said he tried to take legal action against those places but often failed.
"Cole earned more money and moved to California. He bought a house in an area where white people lived. At that time, many white Americans did not want to live near blacks. White home owners nearby protested the purchase of a house by a black family. Cole and his family refused to leave and lived in the house without problems."
"Cole was the first black man to have his own television program. His program began on NBC Television in 1956. NBC agreed to support ""The Nat King Cole Show"" for a while. It hoped American companies would pay to sell their products on the program. However, major companies were not willing to advertise on a program that had a black performer. They believed that white people in the southern part of the United States would not buy their products. Many Americans watched the show, but NBC stopped production after a year."
His family.
"Nat King Cole was married two times. In 1936, he married a dancer, Nadine Robinson. Their marriage failed. In 1948, he married Maria Ellington. They had three children. They also adopted and raised two other children."
Jarvis Cocker
"Jarvis Branson Cocker (born 19 September 1963) is an English musician. He is best known for being the frontman of the Britpop band Pulp. In 2012, Cocker started presenting Jarvis Cocker's Sunday Service on BBC Radio 6 Music."

"He released his first solo album ""Jarvis"" on 13 November 2006. Cocker's second album ""Further Complications"" was released May 18, 2009."
The Sims 4
"The Sims 4 is a life simulation video game developed by Maxis and The Sims Studio and published by Electronic Arts. The game was released on September 2, 2014 and is the sequel of The Sims 3. The game is available on Microsoft Windows and OS X."
It was revealed during Gamescon via gameplay demo and release trailer.
"The game does not require an internet connection to play, but it will need an Origin account and internet access during the initial installation process."
Gameplay.
"The Sims 4 is made from the same idea of the other games in the series. The player controls their Sims' everyday lives. The game is open-ended and has barely any limits. The lots are connected with a large map. Sims can go to lots close to where they are by walking there, but can use their cell phones to go anywhere."
Create-A-Sim.
"Create-A-Sim is needed to create Sims characters. With no Sims, you can't play the game. Sims 4's Create-A-Sim is easier to use than it is in other Sims games. The Sim's body type can be changed by clicking and dragging parts of the Sim's body. There is a slider to change how muscular the Sim is and another slider to change how fat the Sim is."
"A Sim's clothing can be customized by the player. Mods can change this, but mods can also damage the game. Sims have several outfits. Each outfit is made in Create-A-Sim. They wear different outfits in different situations: an everyday outfit, a formal outfit, an athletic outfit, a sleep outfit, a party outfit, and swimwear. The player can change the Sims' outfits at any time in Live Mode."
Traits.
"Traits are what give Sims their personalities. Every trait you give a Sim will add something to their personality. For example, giving a Sim the cheerful trait will make them happy more often. When you are first creating your Sim you can give them three traits, and when you choose their aspiration you get one more. After that you can give them more traits by completing aspirations. There is no limit to the number of traits a Sim can have. The aspirations are:"
"• Active, which makes the Sim more likely to exercise (the Lazy trait cannot be used with this)"
"• Creative, the Sim is more likely to read books, paint, etc. This can link well with most traits."
"• Genius, the Sim is very intelligent. They will become upset if they have not read in a while, and can link well with the Creative trait."
"• Happy, the Sim is cheerful and optimistic. They will become tense around people with the 'Sad' trait."
"• Sad, the Sim is the opposite of the Happy trait, which means a Sim can't have both traits."
"• Playful - The Sim is more likely to have the Playful moodlet, and is the opposite of the Snob trait. It links well with the Immature trait."
Aspirations
"A Sim's aspiration is their biggest goal. You can change your Sim's aspiration whenever you want. The first aspiration you choose when you are creating your Sim will give you a special trait, but changing your Sim's aspiration after that won't change your Sim's traits. Each aspiration gives your Sims a set of tasks to complete. When you complete all these tasks you will get a second special trait. The trait you get will be different for each aspiration. These can be completed if wanted using cheat codes in the game."
Child and Toddler Sims have their own group of aspirations to complete. These aspirations cannot be given to adult and teen Sims.
Live Mode.
"Sims can only move and be controlled while the player is playing in Live Mode. In Live Mode, 1 second of real time=1 minute in in-game time. In Live Mode, the player can control one Sim in the selected household."
Relationships.
"Sims can form relationships by talking to other Sims. The way your Sims treat who they're talking to will affect their relationships. If they are nice to a sim they will have a friendly relationship, but if they are mean they will have a bad relationship. Your Sims can also have romantic relationships with other Sims."
Needs.
"The 6 needs in the game are Fun, Energy, Hunger, Bladder, Social and Hygiene.This can change with the Vampire game pack, as the needs are Vampire Energy, Thirst, Hygiene, Social and Fun."
"One story is one of Hemingway's best. The story, called ""The Snows of Kilimanjaro"", tells of Hemingway's fears about himself. It is about a writer who betrays his art for money and is unable to remain true to himself."
For Whom the Bell Tolls.
"In 1936, the Civil War in Spain gave him a chance to return to Spain and test his bravery again. He agreed to write about the war for an American news organization."
"It was a dangerous job. One day, Hemingway and two other reporters were driving a car near a battlefield. The car carried two white flags to show they were not fighting. But rebel gunners thought the car was carrying enemy officers. Hemingway was almost killed. Later he said that ""bullets are all the same. If they do not hit you, there is no story. If they do hit you, then you do not have to write it. """
"The trip to Spain resulted in two works: a play called ""The Fifth Column"", and a novel called ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"". The novel tells the story of an American who has chosen to fight against the fascists. He realizes that there are lies and injustice on his side. But he sees no hope except the victory of his side. During the fighting, he escapes his fear of death and of being alone. He decides that ""he can live as full a life in seventy hours as in seventy years."""
Later days and his married life.
"The book was a great success. Hemingway enjoyed being famous. His second marriage was ending. He divorced Pauline and married reporter Martha Gellhorn. He had met her while they were working in Spain. They decided to live in Cuba, near the city of Havana. Their house looked out over the Caribbean Sea."
But this marriage did not last long. Hemingway was changing. He began to feel that whatever he said was right. Martha went on long trips to be away from him. He drank heavily to forget his loneliness.
"When America entered World War Two, Hemingway went to Britain as a reporter. Later he took part in the invasion of Europe and the freeing of Paris."
"During the war, Hemingway met another reporter, Mary Walsh. In 1945, when his marriage to Martha was legally over, he married Mary."
"After the war, Hemingway began work on his last important book, ""The Old Man and the Sea"". It is the story of a Cuban fisherman who refuses to be defeated by nature."
"Hemingway said, ""I was trying to show the experience of the fisherman so exactly and directly that it became part of the reader's experience."""
"In 1954, Hemingway won the Nobel Prize for Literature. But he was too sick to take part in the ceremony."
"Ernest Hemingway was 60 years old, but he said he felt like he was 86. Even worse, he felt that he no longer was able to write. He seemed to be living the story about the writer who had sold his writing skill in order to make money."
"In 1961, Ernest Hemingway shot himself dead. Among the papers he left was one that described what he liked best:"
"""To stay in places and to leave. . . to trust, to distrust. . . to no longer believe and believe again. . . to watch the changes in the seasons. . . to be out in boats. . . to watch the snow come, to watch it go. . . to hear the rain. . . And to know where I can find what I want."""
"Ernest Hemingway owned many cats, especially cats with extra toes. Today these cats are sometimes called ""Hemingway cats"" in his honor. His house in Key West, Florida is now a home for his cats and their kittens."
"The article above is a rewriting of public domain material, provided by Voice of America Special English"
MSN
"MSN (formerly the Microsoft Network), is a web portal (a website used to enter the Internet)."
Web portal.
"The web portal launched on August 24 1995 by Microsoft. The site was launched at around the same time as Windows 95. Through MSN, people can create an e-mail account using MSN Hotmail, a blog using MSN Spaces, a group using MSN Groups and plenty more. It is now the #2 visited site in the world behind Yahoo!. Many people have come across this site in one way or another because it is the default main page of Internet Explorer."
MSN Messenger.
"MSN is also the name for MSN Messenger (now called Windows Live Messenger). It is an instant messenger, which allows people to communicate through conversations over an internet connection. As well as conversations using text, this program also allows voice and video conversations. You can even use small ""emoticons"" to express what you are trying to say. Messages are sent and received very quickly from around the globe. Its current messenger client is Windows Live Messenger."
MSN Hotmail.
Hotmail is a free email service from MSN. It started in 1995. It was bought by Microsoft in 1997. Microsoft Hotmail accounts are used to log in to MSN Messenger.
Reed (instrument)
"A reed is a piece of dry bamboo that is used in some musical instruments such as saxophones, clarinets and oboes. The musician blows air through the mouthpiece where the reed is firmly placed, and the air makes the reed vibrate; this vibration in the mouthpiece produces sound all along the instrument, which is changed into specific musical notes depending on the physical nature of the instrument."
"Musical instruments that use reeds are members of the woodwind family, because many years ago the instruments were all made of wood. Today the instruments can be made of metal (brass, silver, gold), wood, or a hard plastic made to look like wood."
"The bassoon family of instruments and the oboe family of instruments play with a double reed. Players play through blowing air through the double reed, making the reeds vibrate. A mouthpiece is not needed."
"He wrote seven stories, six short ones, and two non-fiction ones. Three of his stories, four collections of his short stories, and three non-fiction ones were released after he died. Because he did many exciting things, some people say that, of the many characters he created in his books, he was his best creation."
Hemingway's early life.
"Ernest Hemingway was born in 1899. He grew up in Oak Park, Illinois, near the midwestern city of Chicago. He was the second child in a family of six. His father was a doctor. His mother was a painter and a pianist."
"Each summer, the family traveled to their holiday home in northern Michigan. Ernest's father taught him how to catch fish, hunt, set up a camp, and cook over a fire."
"At home in Oak Park, Ernest wrote for his school newspaper. He tried to write like a famous sports writer, Ring Lardner, and he made his writing skills better."
Start as a news reporter.
"In 1917, Hemingway decided not to go to a university. The United States had just entered World War I and he wanted to join the Army, but they rejected him because his eyesight was not good enough."
"Ernest found a job with the ""Kansas City Star"" newspaper in Kansas City, Missouri. He reported news that happened at the hospital, police headquarters, and the railroad station. One reporter said: ""Hemingway liked to be where the action was."""
"The Kansas City Star told its reporters to write short sentences, and to report unusual details of an incident. Hemingway quickly learned to do both."
His life outside of America.
Hemingway worked for the newspaper for nine months. He then joined the Red Cross to help on the battle fields of Europe. His job was to drive an ambulance and to take wounded soldiers off the battlefield.
"The Red Cross sent him to Italy. There, he soon saw the first wounded. This was when a weapons factory in Milan exploded. Later, he was sent to the battle front. He went close to the fighting to see how he could act in the face of danger. Soon, he was seriously wounded."
"Soon after healing, the war ended. Hemingway returned to the United States. After less than a year he had changed forever: he needed to write about what he had seen. Hemingway wrote many short stories about people who experienced World War I."
Gone to Chicago.
"Some time later, Hemingway left home for Chicago to prove to himself, and to his family, that he could earn a living from his writing."
"But he ran out of money and began to write for a newspaper again. The Canadian newspaper, the Toronto Star, loved his reports in Chicago. They hired him and paid him well."
"In Chicago, Hemingway also met Sherwood Anderson. Anderson was one of the first American writers to write about common people. Hemingway saw that Anderson's stories showed life as it really was. This was similar to what he wanted to do."
Anderson gave Hemingway advice about his writing. He told Hemingway to move to Paris. Life was less costly there. Anderson said that Paris had many young artists and writers from many nations.
In Paris.
"Hemingway decided to move to Paris. Before he did, in America, he married a woman he had recently met. Her name was Hadley Richardson."
"Paris was cold and grey when Hemingway and his new wife arrived in 1921. They lived in one of the poorer parts of the city. Their rooms were small and they did not have water from pipes. But the ""Toronto Star"" employed him as its European reporter, so they had enough money for the two of them to live. That job gave Hemingway time to write his stories."
"Hemingway enjoyed exploring Paris, learning French customs, and meeting friends. Some of these new friends were artists and writers who had come to the city in the 1920s. Among them were poet, Ezra Pound, and writers Gertrude Stein, John Dos Passos, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Seeing that Hemingway was a good writer, they helped him publish his stories in the United States. He was thankful for their support at the time, but later denied that he had received their help."
"Hemingway travelled all over Europe. He wrote about politics, peace conferences, and border disputes, as well as sports, skiing, and fishing. Later he would write about bullfighting in Spain. The ""Toronto Star"" was pleased with his work, and wanted more of his reports, but Hemingway was busy with his own writing."
"He said this: ""Sometimes, I would start a new story and could not get it going. Then I would stand and look out over the roofs of Paris and think. I would say to myself: 'All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence you know.' So finally, I would write a true sentence and go on from there. It was a wonderful feeling when I had worked well."""
His first success in 1925.
"Hemingway's first book of short stories was called ""In Our Time"". One of its stories, ""Big Two Hearted River,"" told of the effects of war on a young man who was taking a long fishing trip in Michigan. Hemingway had learned from his father, when he was a boy, about living in the wild."
"The story is about two kinds of rivers. One is calm and clear, and is where the young man fishes. The other is a dark, threatening swamp. The story shows its main character trying to forget his past, as well as the war. He does not talk much about the war. The reader learns about the young man, not because Hemingway tells his readers what the man thinks, but because he shows that man learning about himself. Many people believe it is one of the best modern American stories of all time. Because of this, ""Big Two Hearted River"" is often published in collections of best writing."
"After the book was published in 1925, Hadley and Hemingway returned to the United States for the birth of their son, after which they quickly returned to Paris."
"Writing ""The Sun Also Rises""."
Hemingway was working on a long story. He wanted to publish a novel so he would be recognized as a serious writer. And he wanted the money a novel would earn.
"The novel was called ""The Sun Also Rises"". It is about young Americans in Europe after World War One. The war had destroyed their dreams and had given them nothing to replace those dreams. The writer Gertrude Stein later called these people members of ""The Lost Generation."""
"The book was an immediate success. At the age of 25 Ernest Hemingway was famous. Many people, however, did not like Hemingway's art because they did not like what he wrote about."
Description.
"The soft-feathered, brown birds reach up to in height. Their feathers are in a double layer which helps keep the emu cool. They have bare skin on the sides of the face and their neck. They can weigh up to . They have two large legs, with three toes on each foot. Their wings are very short, about"
", and are hidden under their feathers."
They can live up to 10–20 years
The emu is common over most of mainland Australia. It avoids very thick forests and very dry areas. Emus can travel great distances at a fast trot. If necessary they can run at up to for some distance at a time. They may travel long distances to find food. One emu was found to have traveled .
Diet.
"They feed on a variety of plants (seeds, flowers, new growth) and insects. Because of their size they need to eat a lot."
Breeding.
"Emus are solitary birds. However, the young chicks stay with the father until they are 18 months of age. The breeding season is between February and July, when the female can lay between 5-15 eggs in a ground nest built by the male. The male then sits on the eggs for 8 weeks until hatching. The baby chicks have very clear stripes on the feathers which act as camouflage."
"On the east coast of Australia, emus were once common but have become uncommon with increased human population. On the other hand, the development of farms and the supply of water for stock have increased the range of the Emu in arid (dry) regions. Emus are farmed for their meat, oil and leather. The first emu farms began in Western Australia during the 1970s."
In captivity.
There are approximately 1100 emus in zoos.
The history of the name.
"The first written description of the emu was under the name of the New Holland Cassowary in Arthur Phillip's ""Voyage to Botany Bay"", published in 1789. The species was named by ornithologist (bird expert) John Latham, who worked on Phillip's book. He provided the first descriptions of and names for many Australian bird species. Its scientific name, Dromaius novaehollandiae, is from the Latin words, meaning ""fast-footed New Hollander"". The history of the common name, ""emu"", is not certain, but is thought to have come from an Arabic word for large bird. This word was later used by Portuguese explorers to describe the related Cassowary in New Guinea. In Victoria, some Indigenous Australian words for the emu were ""Barrimal"" in the Djadja wurrung language, ""myoure"" in Gunai, and ""courn"" in Jardwadjali."
Kiwi
"The kiwi is a type of bird from New Zealand. They are the genus Apteryx of the family Apterygidae. There are several species and sub-species of kiwi. The kiwi is a symbol for New Zealand. People from New Zealand are nicknamed ""Kiwis""."
"They have a long beak and brown feathers. The feathers look like fur. Kiwi cannot fly, and their wings are so small that they cannot usually be seen. Kiwi cannot see well, but they can hear very well. They are the smallest ratite birds."
Life.
"Kiwi are night (nocturnal) birds. They mostly eat invertebrates, like worms and insects. Kiwi keep a territory where they live alone or with their mate. In their territory they build several small caves where they sleep, or lay their eggs."
Kiwi are monogamous; the male and female stay together until one of them dies. The male and female live in the same territory and raise their children together.
"Female kiwi lay 1-3 eggs. Compared to the size of the mother, the eggs are the largest of any bird species. Kiwi are mature when they are 2 years old, and they can live more than 20 years. One kiwi kept in a zoo even reached 35 years old."
Eggs.
"The female brown kiwi lays enormous eggs, which are almost one-sixth of her own body weight. These eggs take 11 weeks to incubate, the longest time for any bird. In comparison, Yellow-breasted Chats' eggs take only 11 days, and chickens' eggs take 21 days."
Habitat.
"Kiwi prefer to live in burrows they make in forested areas. They either make their burrows in the ground like rabbits, in between the roots of trees, or in hidden sheltered places such as hollow logs. Kiwi line their burrows with leaves to make them more comfortable and warm. Sometimes they hide the entrance to their burrows using piles of twigs. Kiwi may have more than ten different burrows in their territory and will swap between them sometimes."
Kiwi are threatened by many mammals. Stoats are the main threat for the kiwi chicks. Ferrets and dogs kill adult kiwi.
Dodo
"The dodo ""(Raphus cucullatus)"" is an extinct species of flightless bird from Mauritius."
"Like many other island birds, they lost the power of flight because it was no advantage where they lived. Dodos were in the same family as the pigeon. They were endemic to (only lived on) the island of Mauritius. They became extinct in the late 17th century."
The Dodo has become a symbol of extinction caused by the arrival of humans in ecosystems where humans had never before lived.
Description.
The house sparrow is small bird. It is between 14–18 centimeters (5.5–7.1 in) long. It weighs between 24–39.5 grams (0.85–1.4 oz). Females are smaller than males.
"Male and female house sparrows are different colors. The male is brown, gray and white. It has a black throat. The female and young house sparrows are brown and dark yellow or cream. They have streaks (stripes) on their heads and wings."
Habitat.
"The house sparrow lives close to humans, often near human houses in towns or cities. It also lives near farms and makes a nest in a bush or small tree. It can have two or three broods per year. This means it has two or three sets of eggs and chicks each year."
"Nest sites are varied, though cavities are preferred. Nests are most frequently built in the eaves and other crevices of houses. Holes in cliffs and banks, or tree hollows, are also used.p52–57 A sparrow sometimes digs out its own nests in sandy banks or rotten branches. More often it uses the nests of other birds, such swallows' nests in banks and cliffs, and old tree nest holes. It often uses deserted nests. Sometimes it takes over active nests by driving away or killing the occupants. Tree hollows are more commonly used in North America than in Europe. This puts the sparrows in competition with bluebirds and other North American cavity nesters so the native bird population declines."
Conservation.
"The number of house sparrows in the United Kingdom has gone down, perhaps because their hedgerow habitat has shrunk. They are now 'endangered' in the United Kingdom. However, in other countries, the bird is still very common. Hedges are necessary to the bird because predators cannot usually get at their nests. They would have no defence against magpies (for example) if face-to-face."
Sparrows in Mao's China.
"Sparrows eat some grain. So Mao decided that sparrows should be eliminated in China. The result was a disastrous famine, with grain yields a fraction of what went before. Apparently no-one knew enough about sparrows. They are major predators of locusts. With few sparrows, locusts thrived and ate much of the wheat. It is difficult in an autocracy to tell leaders they are wrong."
Couch
"A couch, sofa or settee is a kind of furniture that is designed to seat more than one person. It usually has a place to rest your arm on each side. Couches are normally found in the living room or in front of the TV."
"In the 17th and 18th centuries, a couch was thought as a long, upward seat for resting on. One end would slope up high enough to provide a place for the head to rest."
"Some late 18th-century kinds of couches had an arm running partly down one side, and this type continued to be made in England. In Greek places, there were flowing designs with all kind of elegant colors. Many of them had scrolled ends and short legs. The couch was later taken over by the overstuffed sofa during the Victorian age."
Expression.
"Because the couch is usually set in front of the TV, it is the main place where people usually sit and watch it. Lazy people would eventually seem to be stuck to it all the time. This person, a person who does not do a lot of physical activity, was called a ""couch potato"". This was also because potatoes do not move at all, and does not do anything but just sits there. This may also be considered as slang. Couch came from the word ""couche"", which means, ""a bed, lair,"" or from the word ""coucher"", which means ""to lie down."""
Types.
"The most common types of couches in homes are the ""love seats"" for two, or the ""sofa"" for more than two. Other couches include the ""divan"" or the ""fainting couch"", which usually does not have a back. Couches are usually bought in a set together with cushions, which give them a bouncey and decorative comfortable touch."
Jena Lee
"Jena Lee (born 29 July, 1987 in Chile) is a French singer."
"She was adopted by a French family at the age of nine months. In 2007, Jena Lee met Sulee B Wax, who was interested in her work. At this point in time Lee wrote the song ""Some Share"". The song was used in an album by Sherifa Luna. Jena Lee wrote six out of the thirteen songs that are on Sherifa Luna's album."
"In 2008, Jena Lee won the Urban Music Nation contest by Skyrock. Her first single ""J'aimerais Tellement"" was released in April 2009 along with a music video. It was at the top of the French single charts for eleven weeks. It had the highest number of downloads in November 2009."
Sinik
Sinik (real name Thomas Gerard Idir; born on 26 June 1980) is a famous French rapper. His parents are Algerian. Thomas was four years old when his parents moved to Bergères in France.
Porridge
"Porridge is a food which is made with a cereal, usually oats. The oats are boiled in water or milk, or both. It is usually served hot in a bowl or dish. Some people add things to their porridge such as sugar or syrup. In Scotland salt is often added."
"Porridge is a traditional food in many countries in Northern Europe. It is usually eaten for breakfast. In some countries barley or other grains may be used. Porridge is cooked in saucepans or in a microwave. Traditionally, it was cooked in large metal kettles over hot coals. Porridge was often served as food for prisoners in prisons. This is why in English there is a slang expression ""doing porridge"" which means ""being in prison"". Porridge is also given to people who are ill because it is healthy and easy to eat and digest."
"Semolina and gruel are foods which are quite similar to porridge. Semolina is usually served as a pudding. Gruel is a thinner version of porridge that may be also drunk and may not need to be cooked. Oliver Twist, in the famous book by Charles Dickens, was given gruel to eat."
"Schreuder died on 30 January 2021 in Amersfoort, Netherlands at the age of 91."
Bunki Bankaitis-Davis
"Danute ""Bunki"" Bankaitis-Davis (January 2, 1958 – January 29, 2021) was an American road racing cyclist. She won a gold medal at the 1992 UCI Road World Championships in the team time trial. She competed at the 1988 Summer Olympics in the women's road race finishing 14th."
"Bankaitis-Davis died on January 29, 2021 at the age of 63."
Khoriphaba
Khoriphaba () is a God in Meitei mythology and religion of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). He is the son of Sky God Salailen. He came down from heaven to earth to search for his mother and then for a bride. He is best known for wrestling with Loyalakpa in the Lai Haraoba festival. He is also a polo playing God.
Description.
"God Khoriphaba is a Lainingthou. In Ancient Meitei language, ""Lai"" means God or Deity and ""Ningthou"" means King or Ruler. However, the term ""Lainingthou"" carries many meanings. It may refer to ""king of gods"", ""godly king"" or ""kingly god"". Since Khoriphaba is not the king of gods, he is a kingly god."
Khoriphaba is a sportsman. He participated in polo as well as wrestling championships.
"Among the deities, God Khoriphaba and God Loyalakpa possess the epithets of being the best wrestlers. The two powerful gods wrestled during the Lai Haraoba festival."
"God Khoriphaba is one of the polo player gods. He participated in the divine polo match. During the godly polo championship, Khoriphaba joined the southern team. His team was led by God Thangjing while his opponent's team (northern team) was led by God Marjing."
Mythology.
"God Khoriphaba was born with the divine union of God Salailen (alias Soraren) and Goddess Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi at Heaven. When Khoriphaba was three months old (or ""three years old""), his parents got separated. His mother was abandoned from entering into Heaven. So, little Khoriphaba was looked after by the 1000 queens of heaven. But he cried for his mother. Salailen tried to pacify the baby's cry but in vain. He gave him milk but it was of no use. He summoned his nobles and subjects. He asked them to make his son stop crying. Thousands of gods and goddesses tried but all of them failed to stop the boy's cry. Finally, Chingkheirel Apamba tried his luck. He sang hymns in praise of the baby God. Suddenly, the boy stopped crying. At this, Salailen named his son ""Khoiriphaba""."
"One day, Angoupalba Yaibirel Sidaba found Khoiriphaba crying near a tree. He brought the boy to his home. He asked his family to take care of the boy. The clan members looked after the child like their own child. They named him ""Puthiba""."
"One day, Khoiriphaba heard some women talking about him. They said, ""Look how cute the child is! We love him so much! His mother would have loved him many times than we love him. How much his mother would have suffered for the loss of the child."" Khoiriphaba immediately asked them about his mother. But none knew the answer to his question. So, he decided to search for his mother by himself."
God Khoriphaba descended from sky down to earth in search for his lost mother Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi.
"He came to Moirang near Khoiri Keithel. The sun already set when he was there. Not knowing what to do, he started crying. God Thangjing and his consort Koiren Leima came to him. They came to know about the identity of the boy. The divine couple took care of Khoiriphaba."
"Under the guardianship of God Thangjing, Khoiriphaba grew up. He made many friends. He was nine years old. He started wrestling (), race, and so on. He was always the champion of all the competitions. This made his friends fell jealous of him. So, one of his friends told him about how he grew up under the care of Thangjing. Khoriphaba was told that they would not allow him to play with them because he was an inferior God. Khoriphaba felt dejected for many days. Thangjing noticed it and asked him. Khoiriphaba narrated him the incident. So, Thangjing decided that Khoiriphaba should be sent to his mother without further delaying. He summoned all the 27 friends of Khoiriphaba. He asked them to challenge Khoiriphaba for wrestling and race championships. None were ready for the challenge. Then Thangjing asked them about a tug of war in which all of them would stand together at one side and Khoiriphaba alone at another side. There was a condition. If they won, they would be the winner. But if Khoiriphaba won, they should send Khoiriphaba off to his mother's place at Haorok Konthou, carrying him on a palanquin. The 27 friends accepted the challenge. But all of them got defeated in the hands of Khoiriphaba."
"On the next day, the 27 friends proceeded for the journey with Khoiriphaba on a palanquin towards Haorok Konthou. They came from a long distance from Moirang. On the way, they came across a beautiful place. They could not control themselves to rest at the beautiful place for a while. They requested Khoiriphaba who agreed. The beautiful place where they rested was named ""Toubul"" (). Some friends were waiting for the resting friends at another place. The place where they waited was named ""Ngaikhong"". After some time, little by little, all of his friends left Khoiriphaba alone. So, Khoiriphaba continued his journey alone. On the way, he came across a river. On the river, many women were fishing using nets. Since morning, they could not catch a single fish. He was helped by a woman to cross the river."
"Finally, he reached Haorok Konthou. The people of the place were greatly awed to see him. They have heard of his quest. But Goddess Tampha was not at the place. Due to the fear of Salailen, the villagers sent her off to another place. She was looked after by the Kabui tribes in the hills. So, Khoriphaba set off for the next journey riding on his mare Ngangrubi."
"On reaching the village of the Kabui tribes in the hills, he was warmly welcomed by the tribesmen. He finally met his long departed mother. He proposed her to return home back to heaven. But she did not agree because she was abandoned by her husband. So, he sadly left his mother."
"There are also legends about God Khoriphaba looking for a bride. He veiled his face and hold a polo-stick over his shoulder. While searching for a lover, he was riding on a mare."
"God Khoriphaba reached Koubru's place. God Koubru offered him to choose any lady of his choice from his place. Khoriphaba chose Goddess Nungthel Leima. But Nungthel Leima was already the consort of Loyalakpa. So, God Koubru could not give him the desired lady. Koubru did not want to take back his own words. He asked Khoriphaba to choose any lady but he should do it blindfolded. Blindfolded Khoiriphaba attempted to choose but he could not get Goddess Nungthel Leima. This action is enacted by the maibis in the Lai Haraoba festival."
Worship.
"During the Lai Haraoba festival, there is a special ritual named ""Kanglei Thokpa"" dedicated to God Khoriphaba. In this ritual, a group of maibis sing a song depicting Khoriphaba's search for a bride."

"""The goddess of the hills, my beloved"
"The jewel, which I am unable to part with"
"On such a day, I follow your footprints"
I fail to find you...
"On the next day, Kongyamba announced to the people,"
"&lt;poem&gt;""It is evil for land if a poor man win the race. It might bring scarcity more than the people can bear. Let's say this among the people before the race begin.""&lt;/poem&gt;"
"This words spread among the public. Khamba was stopped and told that his name was not in the list of the contestants. Khamba believed them. So, he sadly returned home. He told everything to Khamnu. The two siblings told Nongtholba about it. Nongtholba went to the king. The king told Khamba to participate if it was not still late to join."
"Khamba and Feiroijamba went to the starting place of the race. The race was about to be started. Khamba ran swiftly as fast as he could. Then, Kongyamba's men interrupted Khamba on his way. But Khamba stroke all of them aside. At last, he reached up Kongyamba. Kongyamba was running slowly as he got tired. Suddenly, fifteen horsemen of Kongyamba stopped Khamba. But Khamba kicked out all of them from his way."
"Finally, Khamba reached the final destination. He was the champion and Kongyamba was the second. Both saluted the King. The King was more pleased with Khamba."
The false oracle and the feral bull.
"Kongyamba was thinking about an evil plot against Khamba. But the Gods did not give him any evil hints in his dreams. So, he built a hut. Inside the hut, he tried to connect with a spirit. But he failed. One day, he met fisher women from the Khuman kingdom in the region of Moirang. Both the Khuman kingdom and the Moirang kingdom were in shores of the Loktak lake."
"The women came to Moirang besides having their own fishing area. So, Kongyamba asked them the reason for coming to Moirang."
"The women told him:&lt;poem&gt;""There is a great bull that lurks among the reeds of the shores of the lake, and it had claimed life of many. So, we dare not to fish there.""&lt;/poem&gt;"
"Suddenly, an idea came to Kongyamba's mind. He went to the king. He acted as a person possessed by a divine spirit. Kongyamba told the King,"
"&lt;poem&gt;""God Thangjing had spoken in my ears and I have his behest upon me. Verily said the God, I am sated with offerings of flesh and fish, but this year, my heart longs for the sweet savour of the flesh of the mighty bull that lurks in the reeds that border the water of the lake. My servant Khamba vows that he will bring it for my honor and for the welfare of the State.""&lt;/poem&gt;"
"The king called and asked Khamba about his promise. Khamba denied it. There resulted a great conflict between Khamba and Kongyamba. Later, Khamba told the king he would catch the bull if it was the God’s will."
"The king was pleased with Khamba. So, he promised him to give Princess Thoibi hand in marriage if he succeeded in the adventure. Minister Thonglen put seven marks on the lintel post of the capital city. It was the record of the King’s promise."
The king of Moirang sent an embassy to the king of Khuman. The embassy proposed the great sport to be organized. The Khuman king agreed. A grand Colosseum was built. The Colosseum could hold a capacity of the audiences from both the two kingdoms.
"Khamba captured the bull. He was bringing it to the two Kings' residing place. On the way back, Kongyamba came to him before anyone saw them. Kongyamba pretended to help Khamba to hold the bull. Kongyamba hold the rope. When everyone saw, Kongyamba claimed that he had captured the bull. He added that he even rescued Khamba who fell into the ditch. Once again, there was a great conflict between Khamba and Kongyamba over the claim. The two Kings could not find out who was right. So, Kongyamba was asked to fight the bull within an enclosure. But Kongyamba got frightened of the bull. So, he climbed up on the heights to save himself. Khamba faced the bull bravely. He once again captured the bull."
Royal archery contest and Nongban's advantage of gaining favour.
"Annually, a Royal archery contest was held in honour of God Thangjing in Ancient Moirang. The contest was for the royalties of the Moirang kingdom. Nongban Kongyamba was selected to pick up the arrows shot by the King. Khamba was selected to pick up the arrows shot by the Crown Prince (King’s younger brother). Chingkhu Akhuba, the Crown Prince asked his daughter Thoibi about his Coat Of Golden Embroidery. But Thoibi had already given the coat to Khamba. So, she told him a white lie."
"On the day of the competition, the target was set. The royal priests sang charms over the arrows and the bows of the contestants. The King shot his arrows. Kongyamba fetched the arrows and gave back to the king. For the Crown Prince, Khamba was to fetch the arrows. The Crown Prince shot his arrows so swiftly. Khamba ran swiftly to pick them up. At this, Khamba's outer cloth get loosened. The Crown Prince saw the inner cloth worn by Khamba. It was his golden embroidered coat. He got furious. When Khamba gave him the arrow, he did not take it. He turned away from Khamba. Kongyamba took the arrow from Khamba. He gave it to the Prince. The Prince was pleased with Kongyamba. He told Kongyamba that princess Thoibi would be given to him within five days. From this time onwards, Nongban Kongyamba gained favor from Thoibi's father, the Crown Prince."
Torture by Elephant: Collective evil planing of Nongban and Thoibi's father against Khamba.
"The Crown Prince and Nongban Kongyamba planned an evil plot to kill Khamba. They sent messengers to Khamba. The messengers told Khamba that he was called by the Crown Prince. On his way, Khamba was interrupted by Kongyamba and his men. Kongyamba asked Khamba to give up Thoibi. Khamba replied that he will not give up."
"As a result, they fought. Khamba threw Kongyamba's men upon the ground. Khamba knelt upon Kongyamba's belly. He pressed Kongyamba's throat. He was about to kill Kongyamba. But Kongyamba's men dragged Khamba off. They beat Khamba. His clothes were torn. They bound him so that he could not move. The Prince also came up on his elephant. He told the men to beat him. They fastened him to the elephant's leg with ropes. However, the elephant driver knew that Khamba was innocent. So, he bound him leaving him some spaces to breathe."
"Then they stimulated the elephant to harm Khamba. But God Thangjing let it not to move. Finally, Kongyamba hit the elephant with a spear to move in pain. But it did not harm Khamba."
"In that night, Goddess Panthoibi told Thoibi in her dream that her beloved man was bound by her father’s orders to the elephant and was nearly killed. Thoibi arose and took a sword. She immediately came to the spot for Khamba. The criminals feld from the spot. She saved Khamba from the criminals as well as the elephant."
"The news was informed to Khamnu, Feiroijamba, Nongtholba and Thonglen. Nongtholba, Feiroijamba and Thonglen went to the Royal Court with all their armies. Feiroijamba said to the Court three times about the harsh cruelty to Khamba. However, the Prince did not pay attention to the complaint."
"Nongtholba and Prince Chingkhu Akhuba had a conflict on the matter. The conflict could not be resolved without the King. Finally, both went to the King for the judgement."
"Before their arrival, Princess Thoibi had already informed the king all the crimes committed by her own father."
"The King proclaimed that all the criminals would be punished. So, Nongban Kongyamba, Prince Chingkhu Akhuba (Thoibi's father) and other men were sent in the prison. The King told the Prince to stay there untill Khamba was well again."
"The King sent his own men to take care of injured Khamba. He sent him gifts every day. Thoibi personally took care of Khamba. He got well again. So, Nongban Kongyamba and the Prince were set free."
Plot to kidnap Princess Thoibi.
"The Prince asked his daughter Thoibi to marry Kongyamba. But she rejected. So, in anger, he exiled her to Kabaw chiefdom. He did not want to see her anymore."
"During her exile, Thoibi always missed her beloved Khamba as well as her hometown. God Thangjing softened her father's heart. He sent men to bring her back. However, he asked Kongyamba to forcibly elope Thoibi from her return journey."
"Kongyamba and his men were waiting for Princess Thobi's return. When they saw the princess returning, his men shouted,"
"Experts say ""Fanfare for the Common Man"" was an example of the way Copland changed the kind of music he wrote during the 1940s. He began writing music that was more easily understood and more popular. Copland wrote about this in 1941 in his book, ""Our New Music""."
He wrote that the radio and record player was helping people who had never listened to music before to enjoy music. He said that there was no reason to continue writing music as if these things had not been invented. So he decided to write music in a simpler way.
His interest and activities beyond music.
"Copland spread his ideas about music in other ways. He taught at the New School for Social Research in New York City and at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. One of the many awards he received was the Pulitzer Prize. He won it in 1945 for his famous music for a ballet called ""Appalachian Spring."" It is one of his most popular works. The last part of the ballet is based on a traditional song, ""A Gift to be Simple""."
"Copland also wrote music for several major movies. He won an Academy Award in 1950 for composing the music for the movie ""The Heiress"". Then he began experimenting with what is called the twelve-tone system. His music was no longer as easy to understand, nor as popular."
"Copland stopped composing at the end of the 1960s. Yet he continued to be active as a conductor and speaker. In 1982, Queens College of the City University of New York established the Aaron Copland School of Music."
"Copland was a strong supporter of liberal ideas. In the early 1950s, he and other famous writers, actors and intellectuals were accused of supporting communism. Public opinion changed, though. In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. It is America's highest award to civilians. Aaron Copland died in 1990 at the age of 90. But his music lives on."

464 BC
464 BC is a year in the pre-Julian Roman calendar. It was at the time known as year 290.
Diphthong
"A diphthong (pronounced ""DIF-thong"" or ""DIP-thong"") is a vowel where the speaker has to move their mouth into two different positions to make. It is a vowel where two different vowel qualities can be heard. Examples are:"
"waist, die, noise, road, house, fierce, bear, sure. Each of these is a different vowel sound."
"A monophthong is a simple vowel sound that a person does not have to move his or her mouth to make, like the ""oo"" sound in ""book."" In a diphthong, the person combines two different monophthongs, as with the ""oi"" sound in the word ""oil"". The speaker starts with the mouth in the position to make an ""o"" sound, then quickly moves the mouth to make a hard ""e"" sound. Another example is the ""ou"" sound in the word ""house"". The mouth starts out making a sound like the soft ""a"" sound in ""flat"", then moves to make the a hard ""oo"" sound like the one in ""caboose""."
"Just like with every other part of language, the exact way to pronounce a diphthong is a little different for different accents."
"The word diphthong is derived from the old Greek language. Here, ""di"" means ""two"" or ""double"", while the part ""-phthong"" means ""sound"" or ""tone"", from the basic word ""phthalein"", which means ""speak"", ""creating sound by the voice""."
"A diphthong can be a lexeme of a language and as such it may be one syllable, but rarely."
The Price is Right
"The Price is Right is a USA game show on CBS. The current version started in 1972, and was hosted by Bob Barker for a long time. However, in 2006, Bob Barker announced that he would leave the show. His last episode aired in June 2007. Comedian Drew Carey is now the host; his first episode aired in October 2007."
"In this game, a person uses his shopping skills to correctly guess the price of different products, like in a market. Some products are simple household items, like toothpaste and vitamins. Other items are more expensive products, like furniture and cars. After the third and sixth games, the ""Showcase Showdown"" is played. The three players who got on stage in both halves of the show spin a wheel. They get two spins of the wheel. They have to be closest to $1.00 without going over. The person with the highest total moves on to the Showcase at the end of the show. If a player gets $1.00, they win $1,000 and get another spin. If they hit the $1.00 space on that spin, they win another $25,000. If they hit the 5¢ or 15¢ space, they win another $10,000. In the Showcase, the winners of the two Showcase Showdown games are shown prize packages. They make a bid on them, and whoever comes closest to the price of their showcase without going over wins it. If they are $250 or less from the price of their showcase, they win both showcases. If someone's bid was higher than the price of the real price, that person went over, and was disqualified from winning in that round."
"From 1956 - 1963, the show aired on NBC and was hosted by Bill Cullen. From 1963 - 1965, the show aired on ABC and was also hosted by Bill Cullen."
"Three nighttime syndicated versions of the show aired. The first one aired from 1972 to 1980. Until 1977, it was hosted by Dennis James. For the rest of its run, it was hosted by Bob Barker. From 1985 - 1986, another nighttime version of the show, named ""The Nighttime Price Is Right"", was made and was hosted by Tom Kennedy. A third nighttime version, ""The New Price Is Right"", was made from 1994 - 1995 and was hosted by Doug Davidson. Also special million dollar prime-time episodes where people could play different versions of games for $1,000,000 were made due to CBS shows being canceled."
Monophthong
"A monophthong (pronounced ""Mono-F-thong"") is simply a vowel. The word monophthong comes from the old Greek language. ""Mono"" means ""one"" or ""single"", and the ""-phthong"" means ""sound"" or ""tone"", from the basic word ""phthalein"", which means ""to speak"", ""create sound with the voice"". The word monophthong shows that a vowel is spoken with exactly one tone and one mouth position. For example, when you say ""teeth"", then while you are creating the sound of the ""ee"", nothing changes for that sound."
A monophthong can be a lexeme of a language and as such it can as well be a syllable. There is no shorter syllable than a single monophthong.
Kalua
"Kalua is a Hawaiian cooking method. The word ""kalua"" means ""to cook in an underground oven"" in Hawaiian. The oven is a hole in the ground called an imu. Kalua is most often used to cook pig. Kalua pig is a popular food at luaus."
"Grebes have narrow wings. Some grebes find it difficult to fly. There are two species of grebe that cannot fly at all. This means that if grebes are in danger, they will dive under water instead of flying away like other birds do."
"Grebes can have long or short bills. If they eat insects in the water, they will have a short bills. If they eat crustaceans (for example, crabs) they will have a long, sharp bill."
"Most grebes are brown, white and red/orange. They have many, waterproof feathers. This means they can easily float on water and dive into water without getting cold or wet. In spring and summer, grebes have orange crests on their heads. This is so they can attract a mate. Some grebes do a mating ritual. This is when they ""dance"" in the water."
Grebes make their nest from plants found in the water. The nests float on top of the water. Baby grebes can swim when they are born. They are usually brown and white and do not get their orange crests until they are adults.
Habitat.
"Grebes live in freshwater (lakes or rivers). Some species of grebe will go to saltwater (sea/ocean) when they are migrating. This is when birds fly to live in a different place in summer or winter. Grebes only migrate if they live in North America, Europe or Asia. Grebes in South America, Africa and Asia do not migrate. They are found in every continent on earth."
Funeral director
"A Funeral Director also called a mortician or undertaker is a person who has the job of organizing a funeral. This often includes embalming and burial or cremation of the dead, as well as the planning and arrangement of the actual funeral ceremony. They place the body into a coffin or casket. If people are going to come and look at the body before burial, the funeral director will have the body dressed, and made up with cosmetics to make it look better."
Mangrove
"Mangroves are trees or shrubs that grow in salty water in hot places like the tropics. Mangroves make a special saltwater woodland or shrubland habitat, called a ""mangrove swamp"", ""mangrove forest"", ""mangrove"" or ""mangal"". Mangroves grow on 1/3 of tropical shores. They are also found in sub-tropical Africa, Asia, and the southwest Pacific. Their twisted, tangled roots collect sediment. Over time, the sediment may become islands, or extend the shoreline."
Description.
"Mangroves live right in the sea, or at the sea edge. Their seeds fall from the tree and grow roots as soon as they touch any kind of soil. During low tide, they may fall in soil rather than water and start growing where they fall. If the water level is high, they may be carried far away from where they fell. Mangrove trees are often the beginning of what will one day be a small island. As soil and other things collect in their roots, little bodies of land are formed – just the right place for other island vegetation to grow. This is an example of seed dispersal by water."
"Mangroves have special root-like structures. They are aerial roots or ""pneumatophores"". These stick up out of the soil, and are covered in lenticels. They take in oxygen through their pores. These ""breathing tubes"" may reach heights of up to 30 cm, and in some species, over 3 m. Smaller roots with air passages move oxygen from the air to parts of the plant underwater. For more information please visit a geography site https://www.kidsgeog.com THANK YOU Mangrove"
Benefits.
"Mangrove roots give clear water to the coral reefs which often surround them. They trap dirt and clean water by filtering land runoff and removing pollutants. The tree also protects the shoreline (and, through this, the coral reefs) from being eroded by storm waves. Mangrove thickets are a good place for many coral-reef fish, shrimp, and crabs to grow."
BBC account.
"Mangroves are a group of about 80 different salt-tolerant species of trees. They can live along the intertidal zones of tropical and sub-tropical coastlines. Their roots stand the ebb and flow of tides. The roots slow the flow of the tidal waters. This lets sediment settle and build up as nutrient-rich mud. The habitat is a valuable shelter and breeding site for fish. It stabilises coastlines, and reduces erosion from storm surges and tsunamis."
Great crested grebe
"The great crested grebe is a water bird. It is a member of the grebe family. Its scientific name is ""Podiceps cristatus""."
Description.
The great crested grebe is a medium sized bird. It is 46–51 cm long. Its wingspan (both wings open) is 59–73 cm long.
"The bird is white, brown and black, and it has orange crest feathers on its head. It has a long, sharp pink bill. Baby great crested grebe have black and white stripes on their heads."
Habitat and behaviour.
"The great crested grebe is found in Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. It is the biggest grebe in Europe. It lives in freshwater lakes. It eats crustaceans (for example, crabs), insects and small frogs. It dives into the water to find food."
"The bird has an interesting mating ritual. This means two birds (male and female) do a ""dance"" in the water before they mate. Grebes dance every time the pair meets, and the dance varies according to the circumstance. Returning to the nest is different from meeting out on the water, for instance. Most dances end in a bout of head-shaking."
"The great crested grebe makes a nest from plants. The nest floats on top of the water. A pair of grebes will usually have two eggs. When the babies are born, they cannot swim. Their parents teach them to swim and dive. Sometimes the babies will sit on their parents backs while the parents swim in the water."
Conservation.
"The bird nearly became extinct in the United Kingdom in the 19th century. This is because people wanted to use their orange head feathers. People wanted to put the feathers on their hats and clothes. The RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) stopped this. There are now many great crested grebe in the United Kingdom, where their conservation status is ""green"" (""least concern"")."
Other zinc compounds are:
Occurence.
"Five isotopes of zinc are found in nature. 64Zn is the most common isotope, with 48.63% of naturally occurring Zinc. This isotope has a half-life of 4.3x1018 years. This is so long, that its radioactivity can be ignored. Similarly, (0.6%), with a half life of 1.3x1016 years is usually considered to not be radioactive. The other isotopes found in nature are (28%), (4%) and (19%)."
"Zinc is not found as a metal in the earth's crust. Zinc is only found as zinc compounds. Sphalerite, a mineral that is made of zinc sulfide, is a main ore of zinc. Very little zinc is in the ocean. Zinc ore is normally found with copper and lead ores."
"There are some other zinc ores, such as smithsonite (zinc carbonate) and a zinc silicate mineral. They are less common."
Preparation.
The zinc sulfide is concentrated by flotation. There is a detergent that collects the zinc sulfide. The impurities sink to the bottom and are removed. Then the zinc sulfide is heated in air to make zinc oxide and sulfur dioxide.
The sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfur trioxide.
The sulfur trioxide reacts with the zinc oxide to make zinc sulfate. This makes a soluble form of zinc which can be processed more.
"The zinc sulfate is purified and electrolyzed. This electrolysis makes oxygen, zinc, and sulfuric acid. This makes a pure zinc that is known as ""SHG"" or special high grade."
The sulfuric acid is reused in place of the sulfur trioxide to leach more zinc oxide.
Zinc oxide can also be reduced by carbon to zinc metal and carbon dioxide at high temperatures. This is a blast furnace process similar to how iron is made.
This form of zinc is cheaper but is not pure.
Zinc is the fourth most commonly used metal in the world. About 10 million tons are made every year.
Uses.
As a metal.
Zinc is used in electrical batteries. The alkaline cell and the Leclanche cell are the ones that use zinc the most. It becomes oxidized and provides electrons for the battery to run.
"About 59% of zinc is used for corrosion prevention, which includes galvanizing. 47% of the world's zinc is used for galvanizing. This is used to protect another metal, usually iron, from rusting. The zinc coating corrodes instead of the iron. The zinc coating can be placed on the metal in two ways. The metal can be dipped into a pot of melted zinc. The zinc can also be electroplated on to the metal. Dipping lasts longer but has a patchy surface that some do not think looks nice. It is also used in motorboats and pipelines to slow rusting. The motor of a motorboat often has a ""bullet"" of zinc, that will corrode easily, but will help other metal parts of the motor to stay rust free."
"Zinc is used in alloys. Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. Brass is the most common zinc alloy. Zinc can form alloys with many other metals. Zinc aluminium is an alloy of zinc and aluminium, which makes good bearings. Commercial bronze has zinc in it. Sometimes cadmium telluride is reacted with zinc to make cadmium zinc telluride, a semiconductor. Nickel silver is another zinc alloy."
"Zinc can be used in the pipes of a pipe organ. An alloy of tin and lead was used in the past. Zinc is used in the US penny, which only has a thin layer of copper. The core is zinc. Older pennies were made completely out of bronze."
"A mixture of powdered zinc and sulfur can be used to propel a model rocket. This reaction makes zinc sulfide, heat, light, and gases. Zinc sheet metal is used to make zinc bars."
As zinc compounds.
About 1/4 of zinc is used to make zinc compounds. Zinc oxide can be used for sunscreen or paint pigment. Zinc oxide also is a semiconductor. Zinc chloride is used to preserve wood so it does not rot. Some fungicides have zinc in them. Zinc sulfate is used in dyes and pigments. Zinc sulfide is used in fluorescent bulbs to convert the ultraviolet light to visible light.
In biology.
"Humans need a little bit of zinc to help their body run well. If they do not get enough zinc in their food, they can get a mineral deficiency. Almost two billion people have a zinc deficiency. Zinc deficiency makes one more easily get infections. Some people say that when we get colds, we should take more zinc. Others say that zinc does not make a difference. There are medicines that one can use when they have a cold. People add tiny amounts of zinc compounds to vitamin pills and cereals to make sure that they get enough zinc. Most single-tablet vitamins have zinc in them. Zinc is found in at least 100 enzymes. It is the second most common transition metal other than iron. Zinc also is used by the brain. The human body contains 2 to 4 grams of zinc. A zinc enzyme helps remove carbon dioxide from blood. Whole wheat has much zinc in it."
Safety.
"Large amounts of zinc metal are toxic. It can dissolve in stomach acid. When too much zinc is eaten, copper and iron levels go down in the body. Zinc compounds can be corrosive in the stomach. Zinc compounds put in the nose can ruin the sense of smell."
Zinc ions are very toxic to fish and many things that live in water.
Zebra
"Zebras are mammals of the family ""Equidae"". Zebras are African horses. They are in the same genus as the common horse, ""Equus caballus"", and donkeys. Zebras are known for having many black and white stripes. There are three main species of zebra, Grevy's Zebra, the Plains Zebra, and the Mountain Zebra."
Appearance.
"0 (zero) is also used as a numerical digit used to represent that number in numerals. It is used to hold the place of that digit, because correct placing of digits affects a numeral's value."
Examples:
Telling zero and the letter O apart.
"The number 0 and the letter O are both round, though of different widths. The difference is important on a computer. For one thing, a computer will not do arithmetic with the letter O, because it does not know that it should have been a zero."
"The oval-shaped zero and circular letter O came into use together on modern character displays. The zero with a dot in the centre seems to have begun as a choice on IBM 3270 controllers (this has the problem that it looks like the Greek letter theta). The slashed zero, looking like the letter O with a diagonal line drawn inside it, is used in old-style ASCII graphic sets that came from the default typewheel on the well-known ASR-33 Teletype. This format causes problems because it looks like the symbol formula_1, representing the empty set, as well as for certain Scandinavian languages which use Ø as a letter."
"The rule which has the letter O with a slash and the zero without was used at IBM and a few other early mainframe makers; this is even more of a problem for Scandinavians, because it looks like two of their letters at the same time. Some Burroughs/Unisys computers display a zero with a backwards slash. And yet another convention common on early line printers left zero without any extra dots or slashes but added a tail or hook to the letter O so that it resembled an inverted Q or cursive capital letter O."
"The letters used on some European number plates for cars make the two symbols look different. This is done by making the zero rather egg-shaped and the O more circular, but most of all by cutting open the zero on the upper right side, so the circle is not closed any more (as in ). The style of letters chosen is called """" (abbr.: ""FE Schrift""), meaning ""script which is harder to falsify"". But those used in the United Kingdom do not make the letter o and the number 0 look different from each other, because there can never be any mistake if the letters are correctly spaced."
In paper writing you do not have to make the 0 (zero) and O (letter O) look different at all. Or you may add a slash across the zero in order to show the difference.
Zeroes of a function.
"Functions are explained in the Function (mathematics) article. If the function ""f""(""x"") = 0, then ""x"" is called a zero (or root) of the function ""f"". For example, if the function ""f""(""x"") is ""x""2 − 1, then the zeroes of the function are +1 and −1, because ""f""(+1) = (+1)2 − 1 = 0, and ""f""(−1) = (−1)2 − 1 = 0."
"Zeroes of a function are used because they are another way to talk about solving an equation, which is a main goal in algebra. If we want to solve an equation like ""x""2 = 1, then we can subtract the right-hand side of the equation from both sides, in this case 1. Whatever we get on the left-hand side, in this case ""x""2 − 1, can be called a function ""f""(x). The right-hand side has to be zero, because we subtracted it from itself. So ""f""(x) = 0. Finding the zeroes of this function is the same as solving this equation. In the paragraph before, the zeroes of this function are +1 and −1, so they are the solutions of this equation. We got this equation by subtracting the same thing from both sides, so we also have solutions to the equation we started with, in this case ""x""2 = 1. More generally, if we could find zeroes of functions, we could solve any equation."
Zoology
"Zoology is the science of studying animal life. It is part of biology. The word is pronounced ""Zō-ölogy"", not ""Zoo-ology"". Animal life is classified into groups called phyla, of which there are at least thirty."
"Zoologists are scientists who study animals. They may work in laboratories, or do field research. The methods are many and various. At the heart, they cover the structure, function, ecology and evolution of animals. The structure is investigated by dissection, and microscopic examination. The function is investigated by observation and experiment. Palaeontology supplies information about extinct animals. Zoologists may be employed by universities, museums, or by zoos."
Short-list of zoologists.
Some zoologists:
Zinc
"Zinc, sometimes called spelter, is a chemical element. It is in the group of metals called the transition metals. It is sometimes considered a post-transition metal. Its symbol on the periodic table is ""Zn"". Zinc is the 30th element on the periodic table, and has an atomic number of 30. Zinc has a mass number of 65.38. It contains 30 protons and 30 electrons. In total, 29 isotopes of zinc are known, and five of these occur in nature. Some isotopes are radioactive. Their half-lives are between 40 milliseconds for 57Zn and 5x1018 years for 70Zn."
Zinc is a metal that is mostly used for galvanizing and batteries. It is the fourth most common metal used by people.
Properties.
Physical properties.
"Zinc is a shiny bluish grey metal. When it has just been cut, zinc has a whitish-grey color. If it is exposed to air, it will not stay shiny for long. Its melting point is (), and its boiling point is (). This temperature is lower than most transition metals but higher than tin or lead. It can be melted on a cooking stove. It boils at a low temperature for a metal. It is not magnetic. When heated a little, it becomes very flexible. If it is heated more, it becomes very brittle. It forms alloys easily with other metals."
Chemical properties.
"Zinc is a reactive metal. It is about as reactive as aluminium and more reactive than most of the more common metals, such as iron, copper, nickel, and chromium. It is less reactive than magnesium. Zinc can react with acids, bases, and nonmetals. It does not rust in air, though. A coating of zinc oxide and zinc carbonate forms on the surface of the zinc when it is in air. This coating stops corrosion. Acids can dissolve this coating and react with the zinc metal. This reaction of zinc with an acid makes a zinc(II) salt such as zinc chloride and hydrogen gas. This is a very common chemical reaction. The reaction below is the reaction with hydrochloric acid."
"Zinc can burn when powdered or in small pieces to make zinc oxide, a white powder. The flame is bright blue-green."
Zinc oxide can dissolve in strong bases. This reaction happens in some batteries that have zinc in them.
"Zinc is a chalcophile. This means that it would rather react with sulfur and elements below it on the periodic table than oxygen. That is why zinc sulfide is the most common zinc ore, not zinc oxide."
Chemical compounds.
"Zinc can make chemical compounds with other elements. These chemical compounds are only in one oxidation state: +2. A +1 compound has been found but it is hard to make. There are no other oxidation states other than +1 or +2. Most of these compounds have no color. If they have a color, it is not the zinc that is making the color."
Zinc chloride is one of the most common zinc compounds. They are quite unreactive. They are a little acidic when dissolved in water. They make a green flame when heated in a fire.
"Cats have anatomy similar to the other members of the genus ""Felis"". The genus has extra lumbar (lower back) and thoracic (chest) vertebrae. This helps to explain the cat's spinal mobility and flexibility. Unlike human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones. These allow cats to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their heads."
"The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a powerful and specialized jaw. Compared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth: this is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents. Cats, like dogs, walk directly on their toes, with the bones of their feet making up the lower part of the visible leg."
"Cats walk very precisely. Unlike most mammals, when cats walk, they use a ""pacing"" gait (walking style); that is, they move the two legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side. This trait is shared with camels and giraffes. As a walk speeds up into a trot, a cat's gait will change to be a ""diagonal"" gait, similar to that of most other mammals: the diagonally opposite hind and forelegs will move at the same time. Most cats have five claws on their front paws, and four on their rear paws. On the inside of the front paws there is something which looks like a sixth ""finger"". This special feature on the inside of the wrists is the carpal pad. The carpal pad is also found on other cats and on dogs."
Behaviour.
"Cats are active carnivores, meaning that in the wild they hunt live prey. Their main prey is small mammals (like mice). They will also stalk, and sometimes kill and eat, birds. Cats eat a wide variety of prey, including insects such as flies and grasshoppers. Their main method of hunting is ""stalk and pounce"". While dogs have great stamina and will chase prey over long distances, cats are extremely fast, but only over short distances."
"The basic cat coat colouring, tabby (see top photo), gives it good camouflage in grass and woodland. The cat creeps towards a chosen victim, keeping its body flat and near to the ground so that it cannot be seen easily, until it is close enough for a rapid dash or pounce. Cats, especially kittens, practice these instinctive behaviours in play with each other or on small toys. Cats can fish. They use a flip-up movement of a front paw which, when successful, flips the fish out of water and over the cat's shoulders onto the grass. Dutch research showed this to be an innate (inherited) behaviour pattern which developed early and without maternal teaching."
"Cats are quiet and well-behaved animals, making them popular pets. Young kittens are playful. They can easily entertain themselves with a variety of store-bought or homemade toys. House cats have also been known to teach themselves to use lever-type doorknobs and toilet handles."
Cats are fairly independent animals. They can look after themselves and do not need as much attention as dogs do.
"Cats use many different sounds for communication, including meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, squeaking, chirping, clicking and grunting."
"Body posture is also important. The whole shape of the body changes when a cat is relaxed, or when it is alert. Also, the position of their ears and tail are used for communication, as well as their usual functions."
"These ways of communication are very important. They are used between a mother cat and her kittens. They are also used between male and female cats; and between cats and other species, such as dogs. A mother cat protecting her kittens will fight off the largest dog. She gives good warning with a frightening display, hissing furiously, showing her claws, arching her back, and making her hair stand on end. If that fails, she attacks the dog's face with her claws. It has been said that no dog ever tries such an attack a second time."
Mating.
"Cats only mate when the queen is ""in heat"". Heat periods occur about every two weeks and last 4 to 6 days. Mating in cats is a spectacular event. Several toms may be attracted to a [queen] in heat. The males will fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. At first, the female will reject the male, but eventually the female will allow the male to mate. The female will utter a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her. This is because a male cat's penis has a band of about 120-150 backwards-pointing spines, which are about one millimeter long. When the penis is withdrawn, the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which is a trigger for ovulation. After mating, the female will wash her vulva thoroughly. If a male attempts to breed with her at this point, the female will attack him. After about 20 to 30 minutes. once the female is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat."
"Because ovulation is not always triggered, females may not get pregnant by the first tom which mates with them. A queen may mate with more than one tom when she is in heat, and different kittens in a litter may have different fathers. The cycle ceases when the queen is pregnant."
"The gestation period for cats is about two months, with an average length of 66 days. The size of a ""litter"" is usually three to five kittens. Kittens are ""weaned"" at between six and seven weeks, and cats normally reach sexual maturity at 5–10 months (females) and to 5–7 months (males). Females can have two to three litters per year, so might produce up to 150 kittens in their breeding life of about ten years."
Birth and after.
"Pregnant queens deliver their litters by themselves, guided by instinct. The queen finds the safest place she can. Then she will clean it thoroughly, with her tongue, if necessary. Here she will quietly give birth. She licks the newborn kits clean. In the wild, leaving a scent is risking a dangerous encounter with other animals. The kits are born blind and with closed eyes. They ""suckle"" on her teats, and sleep a good deal. After two weeks or so, their eyes open. At that stage they have blue eyes, but not the best sight. A bit later, the best developed kit will totter out of the nest. The others follow. They will soon recognise you as a living thing: that is a great moment. At first, they go back to the nest to feed and sleep. After some more days they leave the nest for good, but still they may sleep together in a 'kitten heap'."
"The queen, meanwhile, has left the nest from time to time, to hunt, feed, and also to urinate and defecate. Unlike the tom, she covers up her business to hide her scent. Very soon, the kits will urinate anywhere they please unless one trains them. This is done after they are weaned, when they are ready for some kitten food. Here is how to do it:"
"What you have done is exactly what the queen would do in the wild. You have triggered a reflex which all kittens have. The thing is, the tray is artificial, and your queen may do her business outside. But at least when young, kittens need a tray. Your next job is to call the vet, who will tell you when to bring the kits for their vaccination."
"Kittens play endlessly. It is how they do their learning. They will play their favourite games, such as 'hide and pounce', with almost anyone or anything. Soft balls on strings are a standard toy; so is a scratching post."
"With cats there is a limit to how far you can train them. They are at least as intelligent as dogs, but they are not pack animals. They like to do their own thing, and owners do best by fitting in. ""Never hit a cat"": if you do, the relationship will never be the same again. If you really want to dissuade them, try hissing. It has been said that no one really owns a cat; many cats collect extra owners, and may change house if they do not like the treatment..."
"If your kitten was born in your home do not let it out of the house until it is two to three months old. If you have the mother, she will look after the kit. But if you have got the kit from a vet or dealer, keep it in for several weeks. When it does go out, you need to watch over it. The main problem is that it may easily get lost. In time, the kit will learn every inch of the house and garden. Then, you can happily let it roam."
Grooming.
"Cats are very clean animals. They groom themselves by licking their fur. The cat's tongue can act as a hairbrush and can clean and untangle a cat's fur. Still, owners may buy grooming products to help the cat take care of itself. After licking their fur, cats sometimes get hairballs. A hairball is a small amount of fur that is vomited up by animals when it becomes too big. This is quite normal. Owners brush their cats to try to prevent a lot of hairballs."
Food.
"Many house cats eat food which their owners give them. This food is manufactured, and designed to contain the right nutrients for cats. There are many different types of cat food. These come in many different flavors and costs are often very small."
"There is moist canned food and also dry cat food which comes in different sized cans or bags and formulas. There are kitten formulas, cat formulas, health formulas, formulas for reducing a cat's weight, and many others. It seems obvious that the food should be mostly meat, as that is most of a cat's natural diet. But remember, when they catch mice, they also eat the bones. So there is need for formulas to have more than just meat."
"Cats should not be fed a daily diet of dog food. It could make the cat blind, as it has no taurine, which is a nutrient for the eyes."
Health concerns.
"Cats do get diseases, and prevention is better than cure. It is most important to get a young cat vaccinated against some of the most deadly diseases. If a cat gets a disease, a veterinarian (animal doctor) can offer help. Some cats, depending on breed, gender, age, and general health, may be more susceptible to disease than others. Regular visits to a vet can keep a cat alive many extra years by catching sickness and disease early."
"Cats that roam outside will get fleas at some time. Cat fleas will not live on people, but fleas will not hesitate to bite anyone nearby. Owners may choose to buy anti-flea collars, but any areas where the cat normally sleeps need to be cleaned up. A vet or local pet-shop may offer advice about fleas. It is recommended that people quickly take action when a cat gets fleas because fleas can make cats uncomfortable."
"House cats can become ""overweight"" through lack of exercise and over-feeding because people don't watch them. When they get ""spayed"" or neutered (""fixed""), they tend to exercise less. Spaying is done for queens, and neutering is done for toms. It is important to fix cats, and here are some reasons. First of all, if a female cat has kittens, they will need homes. Finding homes for kittens is often quite difficult. If a tom is not fixed, it develops a disgusting smell. Breeders who have entire toms keep them in a special hut outside the house, for that reason. Fixing also helps to avoid over-population. Over-population means that there are too many cats, and some will be put to sleep (put down) in animal pounds (animal shelters)."

Right.
and I'm Brian.
Right.
Just a moment
"Okay Nancy, then I guess the, today's subject is benefits in the job other than salary."
"I don't,"
"no,"
"I haven't recently, um."
Well we can talk about something else.

Yeah.
but I haven't been to any games recently.
"But, uh, I try to catch the game every weekend that I can."
"Oh, really?"
Yeah.
"Okay,"
is that for T I
"or,"
"No,"
it's for Cooper Industries.
Okay.
"Are they primarily electronic, then?"
Yeah.
Okay.
Well
"Well that,"
"they have a, you know, worldwide,"
but
Right.
all we do here is make transformers electronics and stuff like that.
"Oh, okay."
Great.
"Yeah,"
how do you like it down there in Texas?
It's real nice.
Yeah?
Been here all my life.
"Oh, no doubt."
Yeah.
Okay.
I've never been to Texas.
"I've been to Oklahoma,"
"but, uh, that's about as far as,"
"Oh, it's, Oklahoma's nothing like it."
Yeah?
Yeah.
My mom's an L V N.
"Oh, really."
Yeah.
"So, what are you planning to go into?"
Do you want to be an R N
"or,"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Um, I haven't really picked a field."
"I haven't, I, I don't know, I've thought a lot about labor and delivery"
but I don't know.
Uh-huh.
Try that.
"That's what my mom does, labor and delivery."
"Oh, really."
Wow.
"Yeah,"
she loves it.
"She, she really, uh, enjoys."
Is she a nurse in Dallas?
"No,"
she's a nurse in San Antonio
Oh.
"but, uh, she's been, she's been working a, uh, on a late shift."
"She works the, uh, I guess the graveyard's what you'd call it."
Uh-huh.
She works the graveyard shift.
"And she's worked that for, oh, years, when I was small."
Um.
"Uh, I guess probably going on twenty years now."
Wow.
Really?
Yeah.
Have you ever been to a Cowboy's game?
"I haven't,"
huh-uh.
"Um, it's pretty nice."
We we decided just to watch them at home
But.
That's good.
"At least you, uh, follow the game a little bit."
Yeah.
"Um, yeah,"
I'm not a fanatic about it.
I don't know who played when and who does what like some guys are.
"I just like to watch,"
"and, and hopefully they win"
Uh-huh.
That's about the extent of it.
Yeah.
"Right now I'm in, um, college,"
"so I'm more into college football than professional, I think."
"Oh, I see."
"What, uh, school are you going to?"
"Um, I'm at B Y U."
"B Y U,"
okay.
"Yeah,"
so.
"Leslie, what are you studying?"
Nursing.
Nursing.
Great.
"Okay,"
whereabouts is that?
That's between Houston and Dallas.
"Okay,"
all right.
It's the oldest town in Texas.
Is that right?
Yeah.
"Wow,"
that's pretty wild.
"We have, uh, Lake Sam Rayburn out here and Lake Nacogdoches,"
so we do a lot of boating on.
"Okay,"
so you got some lakes around you can do that on.
Yeah.
You do skiing and stuff
"or,"
"Yeah,"
little bit.
Yeah?
All right.
Just got through snow skiing
Yeah?
Yeah.
All right.
Just came back from Denver
"but,"
"Yeah,"
that sounds good.
"Yeah,"
"we've, uh, our,"
the snow up here is really kind of starting to melt now.
"enjoy it, but not for profession, no."
Yeah.
And besides that I kind of learned I wasn't really that good
I gave up.
Yeah.
"Course, my mom thought I was,"
"but, uh, you know,"
"Of course,"
parents always do.
"Oh, yeah,"
"so,"
They're nice that way.
Yes.
"Well, what else can we uh, talk about,"
"uh,"
"Uh, well, I don't,"
"so you listen to kind of church music, gospel?"
"No,"
"no,"
"I, I listen to K V I L."
"Oh, yeah?"
Yeah.
Yeah.
"So I listen to the radio,"
I like the pop music.
"Oh, yeah."
"I like people like Neil Diamond and all, all the folks that you're not supposed to like,"
but that's who I go for
"Oh, yeah,"
the jeezer music as I call it.
"Oh, the jeezer music."
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
L A LAW is one of them.
Uh-huh.
"Although this year's, it's a little easier to miss than last year. With the new cast and everything."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
it's hard to follow.
"Right,"
"and, uh, I like ROSIE O'NEILL."
"Oh, I've never seen that one."
THE TRIALS OF ROSIE O'NEILL with Sharon Gless.
"Okay,"
yeah.
"She,"
"I've seen a, uh, the previews for that."
It's very good.
"It, it's probably very much a woman's uh, show."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, and then there's a new sitcom on that is, Tim Allen's, uh, what is it, uh, HANDYMAN."
"That's not what, uh,"
HOME IMPROVEMENT.
"Oh, we never miss that,"
or we try not to miss that.
"It's hysterical, isn't it?"
"Oh, we think it is, so funny."
Did you catch the Christmas?
"Oh, just part of it"
"I thought it was, you know,"
"and it had such a good story, too."
Uh-huh.
Did you see the end of it?
No.
"IN SEARCH OF SPOCK, or, no, JOURNEY HOME, I think that was."
"Yeah,"
uh-huh.
"Are, you're a real life Trekkie?"
I think so
I really like them.
"I, I wouldn't go so far as being a Trekkie,"
but
Uh-huh.
"uh,"
"Well, I've gone to, you know, one for real live Trek Convention"
"but,"
"Oh, really?"
"Yeah,"
"I saw James Doohan, you know, the guy that plays, uh, Scotty."
"Huh, did you get to talk to him?"
No
It was crowded.
Not in a crowd like that.
Huh-uh.
No.
"It was like, uh, want an autograph, want to stand in line for about four hours."
Yeah.
Wow.
It was a pretty crowded place.
Huh. They have some good management principals in this NEW GENERATION.
"Oh, yeah,"
"yeah,"
"I,"
"it's, it's kind of funny."
"I, uh, was reading in, uh, a book. Uh, trying to think,"
"I can't quite remember the name of the book,"
Okay.
"Uh, aluminum plants."
There's like two aluminum plants .
"What are you, what are you studying there at Heidelberg ?"
Computer engineering.
"Oh, yeah."
What year?
"Uh, just finished up my fourth semester."
"Well, great."
Yeah.
Yeah.
I hope that works out well.
"Yeah,"
it's a big change.
Yeah.
"I spent,  twenty years as a mechanic"
"What's,"
"so,"
"Oh, did you?"
Yeah.
"Well, you've got some experience behind you in the work force."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Are you, uh, shooting for a bachelor's now, or a master's, or what?"
I'm working on a bachelor's degree.
"Oh, okay,"
good.
I'm working on a bachelor's degree.
It'll be
Hope it's a good program there.
Pardon?
Hope it's a good program there.
"Oh, okay,"
"well,"
My boss listens to that.
We listen to ninety-seven point nine
"and that's his station, so I call it the jeezer music."
"Okay,"
now what kind of music do you listen to?
"Well, I listen to like ninety-seven point one, you know, more,"
What what is that?
"It's more, uh,"
"I don't know how to explain it,"
"kind of pop, you know, rock."
Rock.
Yeah.
Hard rock?
"Well, not hard"
Not hard rock.
"Just kind of,"
Not like the eagle.
Huh?
Is that the eagle?
Yeah.
"Okay,"
"I know, I know what the eagle is."
"It's not too hard,"
"it's,"
That's not too hard.
You know.
But it's not enough to put you to sleep
"True,"
true.
Which some of the songs on K V I L can.
"But, that is God's country,"
it has to be.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Do they still have the, uh, the scenic, uh, roadways that cut through the center of some of those trees?"
"Uh, no,"
"they don't,"
"they,"
"the last one, well,"
"the first time I was there, the, the tree was still standing,"
but it has since come down.
Okay.
Yeah.
"But, they are huge."
"If you've never seen them, it's, it's very awe inspiring."
"No,"
"so far, New Orleans is far west as I've gotten. Well, New Orleans and, uh, Minneapolis."
Uh-huh.
"Uh-huh,"
"well, there is lots of pretty country further west."
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
We're hoping one of these days soon after we're out of school to head that way.
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"and you just need to take the little one. Show them all the, all the pretties before they go away."
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
Yeah.
They seem to be trailing out quickly.
Yeah
because there is lots to see
"Okay,"
I'm back on.
Okay.
"Um, you say you watch evenings mostly?"
I watch evenings because I work all day.
I used to watch daytimes.
Uh-huh.
"Um, mainly like ALL MY CHILDREN, that kind of thing."
"Oh, so ..."
"And then sometimes OPRAH and sometimes DONAHUE,"
but now it's mainly evenings.
Do you have any that you like well enough that you tape them when you're not going to be there?
Yes.
Which ones?
"I tape THIRTY SOMETHING, and L A LAW."
Oh.
Those are the two I like the best.
"Oh, two they're going to change."
"Well, one they're taking,   off."
I know.
"It's going to be history, I know."
I don't know what's going to
"yeah,"
we like L A LAW.
Uh-huh.
"We don't watch THIRTY SOMETHING,"
but that's kind of young for us.
My husband and I are grandparents.
"Oh, well. Well ..."
"So we don't watch, uh, that type of show,"
but we like L A LAW.
"We like, that."
"so,"
"Yeah,"
right.
And I like the FRUGAL GOURMET.
"Oh, I do, too"
"Oh, I do, too,"
"but I just seem to, to miss a lot of these programs."
I don't know why.
"I just,"
"if I can catch them, I do. Or if I remember."
"Well, there's very few that, you know, my life would stop if I didn't catch."
"But, uh, now I do,"
"before I go to work, I tape my soap opera."
"Oh, yeah."
I watch one
"and,"
"Well, I watch two,"
but one's a half-hour
and one's an hour
"and, and they lead into each other."
Oh.
And that's the BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL and AS THE WORLD TURNS.
"Oh, okay."
"And I've watched the, AS THE WORLD TURNS since I was a little girl"
"Yeah,"
that's been on for years.
"So it's just, you know,"
"it's, it's, something I've done for the last probably twenty-five years."
"Oh, and so you get to come home and watch them"
"Yes,"
"and I don't have anyone else at home,"
so I have freedom to watch whatever I want.
"Well, course, see, I listen to K V I L for the contests."
I mean
"Oh, yeah,"
"got the bumper sticker, too?"
"Oh, yes,"
"oh, yes."
You can't drive a car without bumper sticker
and you know they're going to call you up.
Someday.
Yeah
"Well, listen, I've enjoyed talking."
"I, I'm sure that the switchboard will probably give us that sign off message very shortly anyway."
Okay.
I appreciate it.
Okay.
Catch you later.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Okay
Okay
Have you done this very long?
"Uh, well, yeah,"
"for the last, uh, couple of months."
"Yeah,"
that's the same with us.
Yeah.
"Well, what kind of car would you buy?"
"Well, it's kind of hard to say,"
"uh, because I don't think we're going to buy another car for about three years."
"We just bought, uh, a car, uh, last year and then bought one in eighty-nine"
"Oh, okay."
"and, uh,"
And there's some Coke
"and you know, just help yourself to anything."
"So it was, it was, you know, the best,"
Wow.
that was a long time ago
and that was only for a few years.
Just once a week.
Yeah.
But I don't know.
I think people that treat their baby-sitters like that get a lot better baby-sitters.
"Oh, yeah."
That's true.
And they stick around for longer.
"Because I mean after I figured out I was getting eighty cents an hour, I said bag it."
And I quit you know.
Yeah.
I was just like but I'm wasting my time.
Yeah.
I really liked the little girl and everything
but I thought ...
"She does take up,"
and they do take up a lot of your time.
That ...
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
I ...
They're very demanding
Uh-huh.
"Well, and she was really spoiled."
They didn't make her eat anything she didn't want or anything.
"So, basically, they fed her cookies for breakfast and lunch."
And the mom was a dentist
and then it doesn't sell
and then the bank's  holding the bag.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well.
Huh.
"As, as you know, anything that involves the government is, works half as well as it's supposed to costs three times as much. Right?"
That's right
Hence the savings and loan problem we have.
"Yeah,"
that's true.
"But, uh, you know, my home is, uh, fairly simple."
It's designed to be added on to.
Uh-huh.
That's good.
Yeah.
"Well, I figure it's just me and my wife"
"but, you know, I like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot,"
so I want  to have a shop.
Yeah.
How big a lot do you got it on?
Ten acres.
Wow.
That's nice.
That's real nice.
"Well, yeah."
It's really nice too because I can't see my nearest neighbor.
He's on the other side of a hill.
Oh.
And my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon.
Seriously.
God.
"I guess, he's a big help out in your garden."
Right.
He likes to dig around a little bit.
"His mother comes in and says, why did you let him play in the dirt,"
I guess he's enjoying himself.
That's right.
"It's healthy,"
why not.
Yeah.
"He was eating the dirt,"
I wouldn't worry about it.
No.
It won't hurt them.
"I was a big dirt eater, supposedly, when I was a child"
and I turned out okay
"so, don't worry about it."
Just let him enjoy himself
"So you think that you want to move away from the big city, uh?"
"Well, that's what I've always,"
I was raised up in a town that was about ten thousand people.
Yeah.
So you're just the opposite from me.
"You want to go back to that, uh,"
"After we got married we moved, ended up moving to the Houston area."
Yeah.
Yeah.
So are you from Texas?
Yeah.
You are.
"So it's not, you know,"
that's true
"Houston, in itself, is a pretty tough place."
Yeah.
"I'm  you know, I, I just, uh, I would,"
"And, uh,"
"I, I, I'm not a morning person"
so I would begrudge the time it takes me in the morning to catch my morning news.
"I get up just barely in time to get up, get ready and get off to work"
and then at work  I have no time to read the news.
Oh.
"Yeah,"
right.
"Once you get to work, I wouldn't either,"
huh-uh.
No
"But I've always been a morning person to get up, you know."
Uh-huh.
but I can't stay up late at night to watch the late news
so I guess that's why I watch it at five o'clock
Yeah.
"But anyhow. Well, listen, I guess that's about it then."
Okay.
It's been nice talking to you Tony.
Nice talking to you.
I'll probably talk to you again.
I had a friend who was in this
and he said that he got calls from the same caller sometimes.
"Oh, really?"
Yeah.
"Oh, well that hasn't happened to me yet."
"So, you never know,"
it might this time.
That's right.
"Okay, Tony."
That's pretty good.
"Well, in the winter time, I can see, see another guy"
"but, you know, he's"
Uh-huh.
"I can just make out his place, you know. I've got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten miles to the north."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And, uh,"
"Oh, that's pretty good."
Yeah.
"Well, I took a lot of time in choosing this site because the, the house has no heating or air conditioning."
Uh-huh.
"Oh, you, you, you don't plan on putting any, any of that in?"
"Well, it's got a, a very small furnace."
Uh-huh.
"And a, uh, we'll use a wood burning stove as well."
Yeah.
"But, in the house itself, I've been working inside, you know, these, these many months"
Uh-huh.
and I have not had to use the heat.
Wow.
Because it's all geothermal.
Yeah.
That's pretty good.
"And with all the,"
"see I've got,"
on the south side is all glass.
"Well, as much as I could get in it, you know. And, uh, the east side is glass."
Yeah.
"I've got one, two, three, four, five, six windows in the east side on forty-eight feet."
So it's almost all glass.
Wow.
"And, uh,"
My wife would love that
"Oh, yeah."
"I mean, you know.  There's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows."
She loves lots of windows.
That's great.
"So, uh,"
Is it a single story?
"Well, not really."
"It's, uh, it's on the side of a hill."
"Oh, I see."
"So the first, you know,"
"the, the, the,"
what I call residential level at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I see."
"And the side that's on the, uh, the other side is about six feet high."
Oh.
So I've got a pretty good grade there.
Yeah.
"And then when I put the verandas which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north, south and east sides that will define the shop."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"that's kind of like, like a Victorian style?"
Exactly.
Yeah.
"I, I've always liked that."
"The,"
"you know, I, we don't have much yard"
but I built a small deck in the back.
Uh-huh.
"But, you know, I, I see these magazines where, you know, dig your, your own deck."
"and she'd gotten all new underwear,"
"and I was like, Laura.  How did you get all this stuff?"
"imitates a woman's ""Well, I just got paid."""
"And, and I was like, oh."
"Had some money in her pocket, yeah."
It was there.
It was burning.
It had to be spent.
"You know, and I'm like"
and she said everything was on sale.
"Oh, oh, that's good,"
at least it was on sale
"That's good honey,"
I'm glad you bought it on sale
What else can you say?
That's right.
I do recommend the for savings bit.
"They, uh, they take it out or your paycheck before you see it because it doesn't hurt."
Yeah.
"I think,"
Yeah.
You don't notice it.
I think that's probably a really good idea.
"You know, you don't even think about it if it's gone."
Huh-uh.
"Yeah,"
"so, uh, until you really need it"
"and then you realize, you've got a couple of thousand dollars built up someplace else."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"see I was,"
"when I had, when I was living alone and I had my own house and things, uh, I put one, I was paid twice a month,"
"and I was just like, we've got to quit this."
And she's like no I don't want her to starve.
But I don't want to make her eat something she doesn't want to eat
"Oh, shoot."
"My mom would be like, uh eat it or don't eat anything."
Eat this or <laughter>.
That's right.
"So, I can see the concerns on what different people want."
Yeah.
"Because some,"
"I mean, you know, if I was setting up a daycare, there would be so many needs you would have to customize your service to."
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Cause some parents won't put up anything. Where others would.
"I think,"
"yeah,"
"I think the best way to go would just be to, to be able to do it out of your basement."
Uh-huh.
"And just have like at the most, like ten kids."
And all from maybe people that you know type of thing.
No.
Instead of trying actually to set up a daycare where you don't know the people coming in and ...
That's true.
"I, I'd love to do it."
But I just don't trust people now.
There's too many lawsuits.
Yeah.
"I just, I think it's a bigger risk than ..."
More than what it's worth?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It would scare me.
I know .
"I mean, jeez if, if the judge was doing it himself, without any checks and balances  whose to say."
Yeah.
"It,"
there would be much more of that
Yeah
no doubt.
Are you involved in the legal system at all?
No.
"But I .  I tend to follow it just to, just to know what's going on."
Okay.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
I've got some friends that are lawyers
so.
"Yeah,"
I do too
so.
One of them just got his law degree.
"But, uh, to tell you the truth, I'm not real familiar with, uh, the system of jurisprudence the way it is right now."
No.
I really haven't studied it in depth.
Yeah.
"I know a little more about civil cases when, than criminal cases. Which is,"
Yeah.
"it's more in how you present it versus, you know, who's right."
I'm sure of it.
"Because a lot of those things, it's all, it's in, it's largely a matter of viewpoint. And who can argue their case better."
Yep.
"Uh, it's kind of weird."
"I don't know,"
you I always think about watching the PEOPLE'S COURT or something. And how weird those cases get.

""Ruth Shorts"" could carry 2.5 tons of cargo as well as a few passengers. Occasionally, the boat would sport a sail if the weather permitted it. Captain Shorts had no schedule; he left when he wanted or when there was enough people to make the trip worthwhile. Shorts would row during the day and when dusk fell he would row ashore and camp on land with his passengers for the night. Captain Shorts would row sixty-five miles per trip."
"In 1884, Shorts owned and operated the ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"". She was a steamer that operated on the same route the ""Ruth Shorts"" did. The ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"" had the capacity to carry five tons of freight and several passengers. She ran on kerosene. After only a short time in operation, the ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"" was destroyed by a fire."
"In 1887, Shorts salvaged the engine from the burned ""Mary Victoria Greenhow"" and modified it so that it was powered by burning wood, and he installed this engine in his new boat, the ""Jubilee"". The ""Jubilee"" was thirty feet long and could tow a barge. In 1889, only two years after she began operation, she sank."
"In 1890, Shorts partnered with Thomas Ellis to improve the lake service in the Okanagan. Ellis could provide the funds that Shorts needed. Together, they had a new boat ordered. Meanwhile, Shorts took the engine from the ""Jubilee"" and attached it to a scow and called his new creation the ""City of Vernon"". He used the ""City of Vernon"" until the new boat was ready. The new boat, named ""Penticton,"" was a twin screw steamer. After only two years of operation, Shorts and Ellis sold the ""Penticton"" to Leon Lequime of Kelowna for five thousand dollars."
"Shorts had never been big on luxury, so when the Canadian Pacific Railway entered the lake service with the SS ""Aberdeen"", Shorts could not, despite his many efforts, compete with them. Not long after the ""Aberdeen"" was launched Shorts left the lake service. He headed for the Klondike hoping to strike it rich."

= = = William Meschin = = =
"William Meschin (sometimes William le Meschin; died between 1130 and 1135) was an Anglo-Norman nobleman and baron. The brother of the earl of Chester, Meschin participated in the First Crusade. After returning to England, he acquired lands both from King Henry I of England and by his marriage to an heiress."
"Meschin built Egremont Castle on his lands and with his wife was a benefactor of a couple of religious foundations. He died sometime between 1130 and 1135, with his estates eventually being divided amongst the descendants of his three daughters."
"Meschin was the brother of Ranulf le Meschin, the Earl of Chester. They were the sons of Ranulf de Briquessart, the viscount of the Bessin, and his wife, Matilda, the daughter of Richard le Goz, Viscount of Avranches. The boys were also nephews of Hugh d'Avranches, who was Earl of Chester. There was also an older brother, Richard, who died young, and a sister, who married Robert de Grandmesnil. Meschin went on the First Crusade and was present at the Siege of Nicaea in 1097."
"Meschin was given Gilsland by his brother, in order to protect the approaches to Carlisle. Due to attacks by the Scots, Meschin was unable to hold it. In compensation, King Henry I of England gave him lands around Allerdale in Cumberland, which centred on Egremont. These lands comprised the lordship, or feudal barony of Egremont. Through his wife, he acquired Skipton, and the lordship, or barony of Skipton. Besides these lands, Meschin also was awarded two escheated properties in Leicestershire, some of which had earlier been lands of Roger de Busli. Other properties in Leicestershire were previously held by Durand Malet and William Blund in the ""Domesday Book"". Meschin also held lands in Lincolnshire and Cheshire from his brother."
"Meschin built the original parts of Egremont Castle at Egremont. It was a motte-and-bailey stone castle on the River Ehen. He and his wife also founded the Augustinian priory of Embsay Priory. Katrina Legg argues that Meschin's main motive for the foundation was to show support for a monastic order that enjoyed the patronage of King Henry I. Against this, Legg feels that Meschin's wife's motives were more probably religious, as she was close to Thurstan, the Archbishop of York. Another religious foundation of Meschin's was St Bees Priory, a daughter house of St Mary's Abbey, York. St Bees was founded around the same time as Embsay, Embsay was founded between 1120 and 1121, and St Bees was founded sometime after 1120."
"Meschin married Cecily, daughter of Robert de Rumily. They had one son, Ranulf Meschin, and three daughters, Alice, Avice, and Matilda. Another son, Matthew, who was the eldest son, died before his parents."
"Meschin died between 1130 and 1135. His widow married Henry de Tracy, and she died around 1151. Skipton went to Alice, who married William fitzDuncan. Alice and her first husband also acquired Egremont, after the death of her brother Ranulf without heirs. After the death of fitzDuncan, Alice married Alexander fitzGerold. Avice married William de Courcy. Avice married as her second husband William Paynel, son of Ralph Paynel, as his second wife. Before 1153 Avice had married as her third husband Walter, the son of Alan de Percy. Matilda married twice – first to Philip de Belmeis and second to Hugh de Mortimer. All three daughters were the eventual co-heirs of their father, after their brother died without offspring between 1135 and 1140. Meschin's lands were divided between their descendants, with parts ending up with the Counts of Aumale, the family of the Courcys, and the last and smallest part to the Mortimer family."

"""White Lies"", released in July 2007, is the first single from Paul van Dyk's album ""In Between"". It features vocals from Jessica Sutta, former member of the Pussycat Dolls."
"""I had a lot of fun working with Jessica. Her lascivious voice and sexy attitude reflects the theme of the single perfectly."" said Paul van Dyk via press release."
Jessica also spoke about working with Paul Van Dyk:
The single received positive reviews.
"""Paul Van Dyk makes a grand return to the club scene with his new single ""White Lies and Jessica Sutta also proves that Nicole Scherzinger isn't the only Pussycat Doll who can sing lead. The combination of these two results in a great song with some great remixes. While only one mix is what you'd expect from Paul Van Dyk, all of the mixes are excellent and worth checking out."""
"""Paul Van Dyk and Alex M.O.R.P.H do the Berlin Mix"" - It showcases all of the elements that make up a great trance mix. Synthesizers and pumped-up drums and beats zoom around frantically with the only vocals being that of Jessica singing the title of the song. It's a perfect choice for those late night punters who don't need a lot of singing with their music."
"If you want to actually hear the vocals, go directly to the ""L.A. Mix"". This mix uses all of the vocals and is actually not as euphoric-sounding as the first mix. The beats are rougher and the trance element is essentially missing. It almost sounds like a Dave Aude remix. Perhaps his influence rubbed off on Van Dyk for this particular version. The added elements of flamenco guitar and punched up drums make this mix a stellar one. This sound is a refreshing change to what we are used to from him."
"""The Dave Spoon Mix"" continues in the same direction as the previous mix. The keyboards are the main attraction here, though during most of the mix they overpower Jessica's vocals."
"Finally, the ""Aural Float Remix"" is a dreamy electronic mix, not at all good for dancing to but perfect for a chilled out evening at home. The song moves along lazily and feels very atmospheric, never attempting to do anything related to a dance floor."
"The video shows Sutta performing suggestive dances in burlesque outfits in two different locations: on a bed in a white outfit, being watched by people through the windows; and on stage dancing around a chair, in a black outfit while Van Dyk plays the DJ."
"The video closely resembles Madonna's video for ""Open Your Heart"" as well as Bob Fosse's choreography for his ""Mein Herr"" routine from Cabaret. The video was directed by Steven Antin and produced by Looking Glass Films in Hollywood, California."
"The track has been a success on the American dance charts, peaking at #3 on Billboard's Hot Dance Airplay chart in August 2007, becoming Paul Van Dyk's highest charting single. On Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play chart, it debuted in the top 40 in late August 2007, since then it has also hit the #3 spot. It has reached #80 on the UK Singles Chart in August 2007."
"On Billboard's Hot Dance Singles Sales chart it has been #1 for four weeks. It has also reaching #38 in Germany's pop charts, #4 in Turkey's top 100, #14 in Finland and #8 in Canada's top 40 charts."

Anna of Foix-Candale (1484 – 26 July 1506) was Queen of Hungary and Bohemia as the third wife of King Vladislaus II.
"Anne was the daughter of Gaston of Foix, Count of Candale and Infanta Catherine of Navarre. Her mother was the youngest daughter of Queen Eleanor of Navarre, and Gaston IV, Count of Foix. Anne grew up at the French royal court in Blois. She was educated in Latin and the Classics."
"The nephew of the French monarch, the Duke of Longueville, is reported to have been in love with her and wished to marry her, but he was prevented because a political marriage was planned for Anne. The elderly, twice-divorced and childless king Vladislaus II of Hungary of the Jagiellon dynasty had been searching a wife capable of giving him a son. His sights were set on a powerful alliance, and Anne, closely related to French royalty, was a good choice. So Anne got engaged in 1500, the marriage contract confirmed in 1501, and she wed Vladislaus by proxy at the French court in Blois in 1502. On her way to Hungary, she was much celebrated in Italy and in Venice, causing a conflict between France and Hungary over who should pay the expenses. On 29 September 1502, Anne wed Vladislaus in Székesfehérvár and she was crowned Queen of Hungary there that same day."
"Anne brought a French court and French advisors with her to Hungary. The relationship was happy at least from the king's view, and he is reported to have regarded her as a friend, assistant and a trusted advisor. She incurred debts in Venice and was said to favour this city all her life. In 1506, her signature was placed on a document alongside the king's regarding an alliance with the Habsburgs. On July 23, 1503 Anne gave birth to a daughter, known as Anna Jagellonica, and on July 1, 1506 to the long-awaited male heir, the future king Louis II. She enjoyed great popularity, but her pregnancies ruined her health. She died in Buda on July 26, 1506, a little more than three weeks after the birth of her son due to complications from delivery. She was 22."

"Spitz became one of America's leading high jumpers while still at Flushing High School, placing fourth in the 1929 national championships with a jump of 1.89 m (6 ft in)."
"In March 1930 he jumped 1.94 m (6 ft in), breaking the US high school record of Walter Marty. At the national championships he repeated his fourth-place finish from the previous year. He graduated from high school that spring and entered New York University."
"Spitz set his first indoor world record on February 7, 1931 at the Millrose Games, jumping 2.00 m (6 ft 7 in) and defeating the previous record holders Harold Osborn and Bert Nelson. He also had the best outdoor jump in the world that year, clearing 2.01 m (6 ft in) at Travers Island and attempting the world outdoor record height of 2.04 m (6 ft in) three times. At the national championships, however, he only cleared 1.90 m (6 ft 3 in) and was yet again beaten to fourth place."
"Spitz was the world's best high jumper in 1932. On February 6 he improved his own indoor world record to 2.02 m (6 ft in), again at the Millrose Games. A week later at Boston he broke the record again, jumping 2.04 m (6 ft in), a mark that exceeded Osborn's outdoor world record as well. Spitz also won his first national indoor championship that year, clearing a meeting record 2.00 m (6 ft 7 in) on that occasion."
"Spitz injured his ankle that spring, and while he remained in good form the injury gave him on-and-off trouble. He was forced to scratch from the annual meet of his own club, the New York Athletic Club, in early June. But he managed to return in time for the Olympic Trials, and after he jumped 2.03 m (6 ft 8 in) in workouts ahead of the Trials and 1.99 m (6 ft in) in the competition itself, tying for first with Bob Van Osdel and Corny Johnson, he was again considered the leading Olympic favorite."
"At the Olympics, however, the injured ankle bothered him again and he only managed to place ninth, clearing no higher than 1.90 m (6 ft 3 in)."
"Spitz defended his national indoor title in 1933, jumping 2.03 m (6 ft in) for a meeting record. At the outdoor championships, however, he was beaten by Johnson and shared second place with Marty, who had broken the outdoor world record earlier that year."
"In 1934 Spitz's indoor supremacy was seriously threatened by Marty, who had never jumped indoors before. At the Millrose Games on February 5 Spitz and Marty tied, both jumping 2.00 m (6 ft 7 in). In the New York Athletic Club indoor games on February 17, however, Marty beat both Spitz and his indoor record, clearing 2.05 m (6 ft in) on his third attempt. At the national indoor championships Spitz and Marty tied for first again, both clearing 2.01 m (6 ft in) this time to share the title."
"Although unable to improve his indoor best, Spitz made his best outdoor jumps that year. He won at the Penn Relays with a jump of 2.01 m (6 ft in) and went an inch higher with an additional exhibition jump. He then cleared 2.03 m (6 ft 8 in) in his home meet at Travers Island, his official outdoor best. Spitz and Marty, both now collegiate seniors, faced each other again at the NCAA championships and again tied, although Marty was victorious in the jump-off. At the national championships Spitz cleared 2.02 m (6 ft in), but had to be content with third place as both Johnson and Marty managed to jump an inch higher."
"Spitz continued his jumping career after graduating, but with decreasing success. At the 1935 national championships he still placed second to Johnson, clearing 1.98 m (6 ft 6 in). At the 1936 Olympic Trials he only managed 1.93 m (6 ft 4 in), sharing fourth place with six other jumpers."
"Spitz jumped in an era in which most jumpers from the American west coast (such as Marty) used the western roll, whereas east coast jumpers tended to prefer the eastern cut-off or other developments of the old scissors style. Spitz, a New Yorker, belonged to the latter group, although his technique was largely self-taught and incorporated elements of the roll."

= = = Pavane (Fauré) = = =
"The Pavane in F-sharp minor, Op. 50, is a pavane by the French composer Gabriel Fauré written in 1887. It was originally a piano piece, but is better known in Fauré's version for orchestra and optional chorus. Obtaining its rhythm from the slow processional Spanish court dance of the same name, the Pavane ebbs and flows from a series of harmonic and melodic climaxes, conjuring a haunting Belle Époque elegance. The piece is scored for only modest orchestral forces consisting of string instruments and one pair each of flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, and horns. A typical performance lasts about six minutes."
"The original version of the ""Pavane"" was written for piano and chorus in the late 1880s. The composer described it as ""elegant, but not otherwise important."" Fauré intended it to be played more briskly than it has generally come to be performed in its more familiar orchestral guise. The conductor Sir Adrian Boult heard Fauré play the piano version several times and noted that he took it at a tempo no slower than 100 quarter notes per minute. Boult commented that the composer's sprightly tempo emphasised that the ""Pavane"" was not a piece of German romanticism, and that the text later added was ""clearly a piece of light-hearted chaffing between the dancers""."
"Fauré composed the orchestral version at Le Vésinet in the summer of 1887. He envisaged a purely orchestral composition, using modest forces, to be played at a series of light summer concerts conducted by Jules Danbé. After Fauré opted to dedicate the work to his patron, Elisabeth, comtesse Greffulhe, he felt compelled to stage a grander affair and at her recommendation he added an invisible chorus to accompany the orchestra (with additional allowance for dancers). The choral lyrics were based on some inconsequential verses, ""à la"" Verlaine, on the romantic helplessness of man, which had been contributed by the Countess's cousin, Robert de Montesquiou."
"The orchestral version was first performed at a Concert Lamoureux under the baton of Charles Lamoureux on November 25, 1888. Three days later, the choral version was premiered at a concert of the Société Nationale de Musique. In 1891, the Countess finally helped Fauré produce the version with both dancers and chorus, in a ""choreographic spectacle"" designed to grace one of her garden parties in the Bois de Boulogne."
"From the outset, the Pavane has enjoyed immense popularity, whether with or without chorus. With choreography by Léonide Massine a ballet version entered the repertoire of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in 1917, where it was alternatively billed as ""Las Mininas"" or ""Les Jardins d'Aranjuez"". For Massine, the music had ""haunting echoes of Spain's Golden Age"" parallelling the formality and underlying sadness he found in the paintings of Velázquez. Some critics found the ballet pallid, but Diaghilev retained a fondness for the piece, and kept it in the company's repertoire until the end of his life."
"Fauré's example was imitated by his juniors, who went on to write pavanes of their own: Debussy's Passepied in his ""Suite bergamasque"" and Ravel's ""Pavane pour une infante défunte"", and ""Pavane de la belle au bois dormant"" in ""Ma mère l'oye""."
"The lyrics, which are optional in the orchestral version, were written by the French Robert de Montesquiou."

= = = Dave Smith Motors = = =
"Dave Smith Motors is a car dealership in Kellogg, Idaho, that attracts customers from all over the country. The dealership has a reputation for being the ""World’s Largest Ram Dealer""."
"Dave Smith Motors started in October 1965 in Wallace, Idaho. He purchased the small Chevrolet dealership from Mort Keane. At that time, the Chevrolets were sold mainly to miners, loggers, smelter workers and local businessmen in northern Idaho’s Silver Valley. Five years later, he moved the dealership to Kellogg, Idaho. Today Dave Smith Motors carries Chrysler, General Motors, and Nissan products, according to the Dave Smith website,(Dave Smith.com)."
"Idaho’s Silver Valley was founded in the 1800s silver boom and is one of the richest silver mining regions in the world. The community is located along Interstate 90 in northern Idaho’s Shoshone County. The valley thrived for decades as one of the nation’s greatest mining regions. Then, in 1981, the Bunker Hill mine in Kellogg closed. Over 2,000 jobs left with the mine sending the area into an economic downturn. The region also lost a lot of jobs in the timber industry. The population of the valley plummeted and car dealerships were losing the battle to stay in business. Dave Smith nearly lost the dealership."
As other dealerships were going out of business in the valley Dave Smith bought up nine other new car dealerships and sold all the brands under one roof. He also cut prices in an attempt to make up in volume what was lost in mark-ups. At any given time the dealership has more new vehicles on lots in town than the population of Kellogg.
Dave Smith Motors was one of the first car dealerships to take advantage of the Internet.
"In the late 1990s when many dealerships saw the Internet as a threat, Dave Smith embraced the Internet and used it as a tool to increase sales. Since the beginning of the list, Dave Smith Motors has ranked high on Ward’s Auto e-Dealer 100 list. Dave Smith Motors uses the Internet to reach beyond the geographic confines of their remote location in Kellogg, Idaho."
"The Internet changed the playing field for dealerships because Chrysler Corporation (now Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) allocates more cars to dealerships that sell more, a policy that rewards dealers who are able to boost their sales. Despite the concerns of competing dealerships Chrysler continued to ship even more vehicles to Dave Smith Motors, and assured other dealers that they could increase sales by improved customer service and referrals. The other dealerships were not pleased. In 1998 twenty-five Chrysler dealerships in five states threatened to boycott Chrysler Corporation if they did not reduce the number of cars they allocated to Dave Smith Motors. The Federal Trade Commission considered their boycott illegal and the group settled the charges before the boycott began."
"Dave Smith Motors is one of the largest employers in Shoshone County, and the largest private company in Kellogg."

For the next few decades, he worked as the director new projects at Service Industries Pakistan, expanding it to one of the largest manufacturer of footwear and motor cycle / cycle tyres and tubes. It is listed on the stock exchanges of Pakistan and has annual sales of Rs. 6 billion. he is a director on the board of Servis Tyres."
"On 6 October 2008 President of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari, patron of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) appointed Butt as chairman of the PCB. He has been involved in several controversies during his career, presiding over Pakistan during a time when security concerns—including a shooting incident involving the Sri Lankan tour bus—stripped the country of several international fixtures. He has made several attacks on current and former PCB officials and the Senate of Pakistan."
"Butt was born in Sialkot, Punjab in 1938. He began his first-class career against a touring Marylebone Cricket Club squad on 16 January 1956 while playing for Pakistan Universities. Batting at number three, he scored 35 and 97, falling three short of a debut century thanks to the bowling of Billy Sutcliffe and the catching hands of Ken Barrington. The match ended in a draw. A month later he faced the MCC once more, this time for Punjab: he scored 43 and 18 as the MCC triumphed by an innings and 29 runs. Butt went on to make several successful appearances in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy over the winter of 1956/57, scoring 225 runs at 56.25 including a maiden century of 147 runs. He promptly toured the West Indies but only featured in one first-class match before returning to the 1958/59 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy where he had a less successful second season: 73 runs from three matches at 24.33, failing to pass 50. He nevertheless went straight into the Test team for the home series against the West Indies."
"Butt played Test cricket between 1959 and 1962. He made his Test debut at Karachi on 20 February 1959. The tourists, bowled out cheaply for 146 in the first innings, conceded a 10-wicket defeat with Butt scoring 14 and 41 not out as a specialist opener. He scored two, 21, 47* and two in the rest of the series. Between 26 March and 4 December he played two more Tests against Australia, scoring a career-best 58 in the second Test. He was then left out of the team until 1962, where he toured England for three Test matches. He struggled, scoring 10, 33, one, six, 10 and six before being dropped."
"Construction of the Air Station was undertaken in 1936 with funds provided by the Federal Public Works Administration. The M.H. Golden Co. was the contractor. The area had to be dredged from the bay and filled and brought up to grade level. Long piles were driven in the soil at the building sites for stabilization. The contract called for one hangar with lean-to, a mess hall, a barracks building, two aprons, a runway to the field, and a small wooden seaplane ramp. During and prior to this time a Coast Guard Air Detachment was maintained on Lindbergh Field in one-half of a commercial hangar. This detachment was led by Elmer F. Stone after May 21, 1935. Stone is one of Coast Guard Aviation's most colorful figures."
"In April 1937, the Air Station was commissioned. The first commanding officer was LT S.C. Linholm, who later became Commander of Eleventh Coast Guard District. There had, however, been an Air Patrol Detachment active in San Diego between 1934 and 1937. At the time this was the only Coast Guard air base in California."
"Coast Guard Air Station San Diego saw no radical changes as a result of the declaration of war in 1941. The unit continued to watch and report the activities of fishing boats in the area, to provide assistance in cases of distress, and to provide transportation by air for other government departments. Air Sea Rescue operations were given primary focus from October 1943 on. Between January 1 and December 1, 1944, a total of 124 aircraft went down in waters covered by this unit. Of the 201 pilots and crewmen involved, 137 were saved, 59 were killed outright by mid-air collisions or impact with the water, two are missing, and three who might have been saved were lost because of improper equipment or the failure to locate them promptly."

"Constantine ""Gene"" Mako ( ; January 24, 1916 – June 14, 2013) was an American tennis player and art gallery owner. He was born in Budapest, capital of Hungary. He won four Grand Slam doubles titles in the 1930s. Mako was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1973."
"His father, Bartholomew Mako (), graduated from the Budapest Academy of Fine Arts in 1914. He started to work as a draftsman for his mentor Viktor Madarász. He was an avid soccer player himself. He fought in World War I. After the war, he left Hungary with his wife, Georgina Elizabeth Farkas Mako () and only son, traveling first to Italy, then stopping for three years in Buenos Aires, Argentina, before settling in Los Angeles, California. There he created works for public places like churches, libraries and post offices. Gene attended to the Glendale High School and the University of Southern California although he was offered a Hungarian University Scholarship in the meantime. He quit before graduation."
"In 1934 he won the NCAA championships in singles and the doubles (with Phillip Caslin) while playing for the University of Southern California where he lettered at USC for three years (1934-36-37). He also won the boys' singles event at the U.S. National Championships in 1932 and 1934 and the boys' doubles in 1932, 1933 and 1934."
"Mako was especially successful as a doubles player with his partner and friend Don Budge. They competed in seven Grand Slam finals, four of which they won."
"In 1936 Gene Mako and Alice Marble won the finals at the US Mixed Doubles Championships against Sarah Palfrey and Don Budge (6:3 and 6:2). They won the Newport Casino Invitational Tournament three consecutive times, from 1936 to 1938."
"From 1935 to 1938 Mako was a member of the United States Davis Cup team and played in eight ties. The US team won the Davis Cup in 1937, defeating the United Kingdom in the final at Wimbledon, and again in 1938 in the final against Australia at the Germantown Cricket Club in Philadelphia. As a Davis Cup player he compiled a record of six wins and three losses."
"Mako was in the U.S. Top Ten in 1937 and 1938 (reaching as high as No. 3), and was ranked World No. 8 by A. Wallis Myers of The Daily Telegraph in 1938. That year he reached the U.S. final at Forest Hills versus his double partner, Don Budge, who was in pursuit of the first Grand Slam. Unseeded, Mako reached his only major singles final on victories over sixth-seed Frank Kovacs and the third and first foreign seeds, Franjo Punčec and John Bromwich."
"In 1939 he was suspended and banned from playing for breaching the amateur rules. He and Don Budge allegedly accepted a sum of 20A£ for an exhibition match in Australia, which was against amateurism. Afterwards he continued to play tennis at that time during the Second World War while serving in the Navy. He also played professional basketball while stationed in Norfolk, Virginia."
In 1973 Mako was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. In 1999 he was elected to the University of Southern California (USC) Athletic Hall of Fame.
"He possessed strong serve and powerful smashes but due to several injuries in his career, he had to give up his power game. He preferred a volleying style, which he perfected with quickness, good angle selection and pacing paired with strategy."
"Apart from being a sportsman, Mako composed music in his early 20s. He's the author of two songs, namely ""Lovely as Spring"" and ""What Did You Dream Last Night?"". He also starred in the 1938 musical ""Happy Landing"" and the 1941 war comedy ""Caught in the Draft"", although he remained uncredited in both movies. Mako married actress Laura Mae Church in Manhattan in 1941. A month later, World War II broke out, and he joined the United States Navy. After this, he worked in a broadcasting studio.

Romuald Désiré Peiser (born 3 August 1979) is a French former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper.
"Peiser was born in Phalsbourg, Moselle. After unsuccessfully emerging through Paris Saint-Germain FC's youth system – only appeared for the reserves – he played in Germany with Bayer Leverkusen II and KFC Uerdingen, both in the lower leagues; subsequently, he spent one season in the Swiss Challenge League with FC Vaduz."
"Peiser made his top flight debut in the 2003–04 campaign, only missing four Liga I games as FC Rapid Bucureşti finished in third position. He returned to his country for the following four years, spending two apiece with Troyes AC and FC Gueugnon and being part of the former team's Ligue 1 roster in 2005–06 (no league appearances)."
"In 2008, aged 29, Peiser moved countries again, going on to start for both Portuguese sides he represented, Associação Naval 1º de Maio and Académica de Coimbra, both in the Primeira Liga. His first match in the competition took place on 4 October 2008 while at the service of the former, in a 1–1 home draw to C.F. Os Belenenses."
"On 9 July 2014, Peiser signed with his first non-European club, joining Ottawa Fury FC of the North American Soccer League. In July of the following year, he broke a record in the competition – in both the original and modern-day incarnation – for the longest shutout record."
"In December 2016, 37-year-old Peiser moved to fellow league team San Francisco Deltas. He won the Soccer Bowl in his first season, keeping a clean sheet in the decisive match against New York Cosmos (2–0 at the Kezar Stadium)."
"In March 2018, Peiser signed with United Soccer League side Penn FC. After retiring later in that year, he worked as goalkeeper coach at Sacramento Republic FC."

"Eaton Chapel is a private chapel to the north of Eaton Hall in Eaton Park, near the village of Eccleston, Cheshire, England. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building."
"Building of the chapel commenced in 1869, soon after the estate was inherited by Hugh Grosvenor, the 3rd Marquess of Westminster, in conjunction with a major rebuilding of the hall. Grosvenor became the 1st Duke of Westminster in 1874. He appointed Alfred Waterhouse as architect and the building was completed in 1884. When the Waterhouse hall was demolished in 1963, the chapel was retained."
"The chapel is built in buff sandstone with a grey slate roof. Internally the stone is in pink and buff bands. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave that is continuous with a three-bay chancel. The chancel terminates with a three-sided apse containing the altar. The chapel is oriented with the altar at the west end. The last bay at the east end constitutes a narthex (ante-chapel) with a gallery. On the south of the chapel is a tower which is free-standing, but joined to the chapel at the lower two storeys, and by a bridge above. At the southeast corner is a staircase turret. On the south side of the nave and in the apse are two-light windows and at the east end behind the gallery is a four-light window. The tower has six stages and contains tall lancet bell-openings. Above these is the clock stage, corbelled out from the shaft of the tower and surmounted by pinnacles at each corner. On each side is a clock face made from vitreous enamel; each clock face is in diameter. Over this is a spire decorated with gables and pinnacles. The staircase turret is surmounted by a spire."
"The narthex at the east end has a groin vaulted oak roof, and is paved with black marble and with encaustic tiles. A stone screen leads into the nave. This also has a groin vaulted roof, but built in stone. Between the nave and the chancel is a low alabaster screen. A continuation of this screen leads to the pulpit: this is also constructed in alabaster with Devonshire marble columns. The reredos and the font are also made in alabaster. The benches in the nave and chancel are in walnut and have carved ends. In the chancel is a recumbent effigy in alabaster of Constance, 1st Duchess of Westminster, by Joseph Boehm. For the effigy, Boehm worked from plaster casts of the face and hands taken after her death."
"The stained glass in the windows of the south side of the nave and the apse, and the mosaics in the blank on the north side of the nave were designed by Frederic Shields. These were commissioned in 1876 and made by Heaton, Butler and Bayne. The two-manual organ is in an alcove on the south side of the chancel. It was built in 1870–71 by Charles Whitley of Chester and is still in good working order. The clock tower contains a carillon of 28 bells which were cast by Chavalier Severian Van Aerschodt of Louvain; it plays 31 tunes. The clock was manufactured by Gillet's of Croydon."
"The chapel continues to be the private chapel of the Grosvenor family and is used for family christenings, confirmations and memorial services. Each December it is made available for up to eight charities to arrange carol concerts. The chapel is also open to the general public on three annual open days."

= = = Walsh convention = = =
Walsh is a convention used in the card game of bridge in response to an opening bid of 1. The convention has its origins in the Walsh System developed by Richard Walsh.
"In general, the Walsh convention is not used in four-card major systems such as Acol, but may be employed in some five-card major systems; especially those that use a prepared club, rather than better minor. The opening bid of 1 will therefore have shown either clubs or a balanced hand."
"When responder is too weak to force to game diamond suits are bypassed in favour of major suits, regardless of the length of the diamond suit. For example, holding , the response to the opening bid of 1 would be 1 rather than the normal 1."
"Continuations vary according to other details of the system being played. If Checkback Stayman is being played, then the auction 1 – 1; 1NT – 2 would show this hand and end the auction. If New minor forcing is being used, then 3 is used as the sign off bid instead."
"When the values to force to game are held, the procedure is abandoned, and suits are bid in the normal order. Responders reverse from diamonds into a major thus becomes game forcing. So, holding , the auction starts 1 – 1; 1NT – 2."
"The main purpose of the convention is to avoid missing major suit fits when opener has something akin to a weak notrump, and would rebid 1NT over the normal 1 response. The major suit fit is likely to provide a safer resting place when the hands are weak, as well as potentially scoring better (a concern perhaps only at matchpoints)."
It is a form of Canapé and thus the responses of 1 and 1 to a 1 opener are alertable in the UK under EBU regulations.

Sa Coma is more family oriented, and evening entertainment centres on hotels, rather than in bars or clubs."
"Some of the shops in Sa Coma also cater for tourists, with many products in the supermarkets being imported from tourists' home countries. In addition to the duty-free and sport shops, there are 'Perfumerías' (perfume shops) and a Carrefour hypermarket within Sa Coma town (previously owned by Eroski)."

= = = The Guns of Brixton = = =
"""The Guns of Brixton"" is a song by the English punk rock band The Clash. It was written and sung by bassist Paul Simonon, who grew up in Brixton, South London. The song has a strong reggae influence, reflecting the culture of the area and the reggae gangster film ""The Harder They Come""."
"""The Guns of Brixton"" was the Clash's first song to be composed and sung by Paul Simonon. By the time of ""London Calling"", Simonon had learned to play guitar and started contributing more to the songwriting."
"The band, separated from manager Bernard Rhodes, had to leave their rehearsal studio in Camden Town and find another location. They began work on ""London Calling"" during the summer of 1979 at the Vanilla Studios in Pimlico. The band quickly wrote and recorded demos, and in August 1979 entered Wessex Studios to begin recording the album. Produced by Guy Stevens, who at the time had alcohol and drug problems and whose production methods were unconventional, it was recorded within a matter of weeks, with many songs, including ""The Guns of Brixton"", recorded in one or two takes. It was also revealed that while recording the lead vocals for the song, Simonon sang while staring directly at a CBS executive who had visited the studio during the sessions, giving Simonon the desired amount of emotion in his voice."
"A section of the song is sung by a very young Maria Gallagher, accompanied by her father Mick Gallagher on the keyboard, as a reprise at the end of the song ""Broadway"" on the 1980 Clash album ""Sandinista!"""
"""The Guns of Brixton"" predates the riots that took place in the 1980s in Brixton, but the lyrics depict the feelings of discontent in the area because of the heavy-handedness of the police, the recession and other problems at the time. The lyrics refer to a Brixton-born son of Jamaican immigrants who ""feel[s] like Ivan...at the end of ""The Harder they Come"""", referring to Ivanhoe Martin's death in the 1972 film ""The Harder They Come"". Simonon was originally doubtful about the song's lyrics, which discuss an individual's paranoid outlook on life, but was encouraged to continue working on it by Joe Strummer."
"""The Guns of Brixton"" was not initially released as a single, but a version of the song, taken from the remastered version of ""London Calling"" and remixed by Jeremy Healy, was released by CBS as a CD single, 7-inch vinyl and 12-inch vinyl entitled ""Return to Brixton"" in July 1990 (catalog number 656072-2). It reached #57 on the UK Singles Chart."
"""The Guns of Brixton"" was a mainstay in the Clash's live set. When performing the song live, Simonon would switch instruments with Strummer because he was unable to play the bass line whilst singing lead vocals at the same time."
"A somewhat heavier, faster version than the one found on ""London Calling"" appeared on the 1999 live compilation """"."
"Norman Cook (also known as Fatboy Slim) sampled the bass line for Beats International's 1990 song ""Dub Be Good to Me"", which became a #1 hit in the UK. Simonon, interviewed by Scott Rowley in October 1999 for ""Bassist Magazine"", said that he ""was surprised that it became number one that was quite shocking. And the fact that it was my performance that they had lifted. The smart thing would've been to copy it and change it slightly, but they just lifted it straight off. So, really, I have done ""Top of the Pops"", but I met up with Norman [Cook] and we came to an arrangement which was much needed at the time. But I thought it was a really good idea and it was quite reassuring for that to happen to my first song."""
"Cypress Hill sampled the baseline on ""What's Your Number?"" from the 2004 album ""Till Death Do Us Part."" The song also features Tim Armstrong on guitar."
"Jimmy Cliff covered the song on his 2011 ""Sacred Fire EP"", and 2012 album ""Rebirth"", produced by Armstrong. Will Hermes has called the cover ""the sound of history circling in wondrous ways"" because the song references Cliff's character Ivan from ""The Harder They Come""."
"Reverend and the Makers frontman Jon McClure stated that his band's song ""Nostalgia"" from the album ""ThirtyTwo"" was ""my attempt at a modern 'Guns of Brixton'""."

"“Zi Mo (子莫) holds on to the middle… Holding on to the middle is closer to being right, but to do this without the proper measure is not different from holding to one extreme.”"
1. Pòtí:
"Mencius’ contemporary Zi Mo wanted to rectify the deviation of heterodox teachings, but did not realize that he himself fell into deviation."
2. Chéngtí:
"The fact is, the middle is defined as “not deviant,” and the correct application of the middle is the proper measure. Zi Mo wanted to rectify the deviant ways of Yang Zi (楊子) and Mo Zi (墨子), but did not know the proper measure, so this was but another deviation. This was the standard Mencius used to repudiate his error and to establish our way."
3. Qǐjiǎng:
"To elaborate, for our Way is the principal one, but the manifestations are many; egoism and indiscriminate love certainly deviate from the Way. And our way uses the one principle to join together the many, but those who hold on to egoism or indiscriminate love are certainly holding on to an extreme which leads nowhere. Thus there was Zi Mo who understood the errors of Yang Zi and Mo Zi, and thereupon mediated between the two in order to grasp the middle course."
4. Qǐgǔ:
"Zi Mo would probably say, I cannot bear to be like Yang Zi, who cut off all ties with others in a niggardly fashion; I simply stop short of loving indiscriminately."
I have not time to be like Mo Zi who joyfully sacrifices himself for others: I simply stop short of being an egoist.
"Because one rejects egoism, one may be thought to be escaping from the error of Yang Zi and heading towards benevolence."

He relates the story of the Great Flood and also the Tower of Babel. After he tells his stories, his two wives decree that he is their king and god. Belshazzar asks what can break their bond, and Daniel informs him that “The Hand of God,” can break up Belshazzar, Vanity, and Idolatry. Belshazzar gets upset with Daniel and threatens his life. Daniel says that God will save him. Vanity and Idolatry tell Belshazzar that Daniel is annoying them and they want to leave. As they leave, Belshazzar tells Daniel he owes his life to the two queens, not to God. The Thought tells Daniel that he has learned a valuable lesson – by invoking the hand of God, his life can be spared in future situations."
"Death and Daniel enter and discuss Belshazzar and his sins of vanity and idolatry. Death offers to kill Belshazzar for Daniel, as an agent of an angry God. Daniel gives Death permission to visit Belshazzar and scare him, but not kill him. Daniel wants to save his soul. Death is upset about only being allowed to show himself to and warn Belshazzar and not take his soul. He calls for Thought. Thought joins Death and is scared of him. Death asks Thought where Belshazzar is. Thought tells Death that Belshazzar is with his two wives in the garden. Death asks Thought to take him there. Thought does because he doesn't have the courage to say no."
"Belshazzar, Idolatry, and Vanity enter. The ask Belshazzar why he looks so sad and stops talking so suddenly. Belshazzar says he doesn't know the source of the intense pain he feels. It is Death approaching that none of the trio can see. Death shows himself to Belshazzar who is shocked and terrified. He asks Death who he is; Death tells Belshazzar that he is a creditor here to collect a debt that Belshazzar owes. Thought rethinks his decision to lead Death to Belshazzar. Belshazzar asks what he owes. Death shows him a book that has the debt listed, but Belshazzar states that the book is one he lost. Death says the debt was written down by Belshazzar himself. He reads back what Belshazzar wrote about owing his life to Death. Death tells Belshazzar that today is not the day that he has come to collect the debt, but that the day is coming. Death exits."
"Belshazzar, Idolatry, Vanity, and Thought are still together. The two queens want to know what is troubling Belshazzar. He says he is not sure – some phantom visited him. To please Belshazzar, the queens take turns complimenting each other. They all sit down and Idolatry fans Belshazzar with the feather from her hat while Vanity sings to him about his greatness to continue to soothe him."
"Death is angry because the queens have soothed Belshazzar into a sleep. Death says he will haunt Belshazzar in his dream. The queens leave the garden and Thought also falls asleep. Death sees Belshazzar asleep and decides to kill him. He draws his sword, but Daniel enters and says, “No,” while holding back the arms of Death. Death inquires why he cannot kill the king. Daniel says Belshazzar has not lived his whole life and it is not time yet for him to die. Death argues that Belshazzar's life is a mockery to both God and Death."
"While Belshazzar is asleep, in his dream the queens enter with a Statue – it is Belshazzar as a god. The queens praise Belshazzar and build him up. The Statue warns Belshazzar in his sleep that he needs to leave Idolatry and Vanity behind or else he will suffer because of them. The Statue tells the dream queens that the great God decrees them gone. Belshazzar wakes up and is troubled by what he saw and felt in his sleep. He starts to question keeping so much stock in Idolatry and Vanity. However, Idolatry seduces him again and he returns to his former self. Thought suggests Belshazzar throw a feast to shake off all of the melancholy. Belshazzar calls for the gold wine glasses and wine reserved for presenting the Eucharist to be used, because he deserves the best. Idolatry and Vanity set the table for the feast while Thought sings."
"Death comes to the feast in a disguise and makes a plea to God to loose his hand in order to kill Belshazzar due to his sacrilegious behavior against the Eucharist on top of his sins of Idolatry and Vanity. Belshazzar demands wine, and Death, being mistaken for a servant, brings him a golden cup of poisoned wine declaring that in the cup is both Life and Death. Belshazzar toasts himself, drinks the wine, and then there are several increasingly loud thunder claps. A hand appears in the clouds and writes nonsense words that neither Idolatry, Vanity, Belshazzar, nor Thought can decipher. Idolatry says Daniel can read them and calls him to do it."
"Daniel comes and interrupts the words that translate to mean that: One, God has numbered Belshazzar's days on earth. Two, Belshazzar has been weighed in the balance and been found wanting. Three, Belshazzar's kingdom will be a wasteland ravaged by his enemies when Belshazzar dies. All this because Belshazzar has profaned the sacred golden sacramental cups meant only to be used for the Eucharist. Death tells Belshazzar know that there was “death,” or poison, in the cups. Belshazzar cries out for Idolatry to save him, but she cannot. He calls out to Vanity to help him, but she cannot. Belshazzar asks Thought to help him, but Thought reminds him that he did not take heed of the warnings he received. Belshazzar finally calls on Daniel. Daniels says he is God's agent and Belshazzar must take his punishment. Belshazzar wonders who could save him – Death says no one. Death says “Die, thou sinner,” draws his sword, and stabs Belshazzar in the heart. As Death and Belshazzar wrestle, Belshazzar calls out a warning to all men. Idolatry lays down her worship of all other gods for God Himself, asks for forgiveness for Calderón's faults, and says that his intentions as the playwright was to point back to God."

The film stars Sanjay Dutt, Ritesh Deshmukh, Arshad Warsi, Aashish Chaudhary and Javed Jaffrey in the lead roles while Asrani, Sanjay Mishra, Vijay Raaz, Manoj Pahwa and Tiku Talsania are featured in supporting roles. It is heavily inspired from Rat Race which is a 2001 American comedy film directed by Jerry Zucker, and some scenes are shot-for-shot copies from other Mr. Bean Movies. It is the first installment of ""Dhamaal film series"". The film was remade on 2008 Kannada movie ""Mast Maja Maadi""."
"In 2011, the film spawned a sequel, under the title of ""Double Dhamaal"", with the lead cast reprising their roles."
"A third sequel, under the name ""Total Dhamaal"" was released in February 2019, with only Deshmukh, Warsi and Jaffrey returning with an entirely new cast and a fresh story, having no connections to ""Dhamaal"" and ""Double Dhamaal."""
"Four good-for-nothing friends - Roy (Ritesh Deshmukh), Adi (Arshad Warsi), Boman (Aashish Chaudhary), and Manav(Javed Jaffrey) - are kicked out of their house by their landlady (Suhasini Mulay) for not paying their rents. Desperate to earn money, they devise up a plan. Adi tells Manav to steal a painting from the house. They decide to sell it to the son of the late Businessman Dwiwedi. However, Manav accidentally picks up a blank painting not knowing the reality. They humorously sell the painting for Rs.20,000 to Dwiwedi. They then pick up the original painting with the intention to sell it to Mr. Aggarwal, not knowing that he has been murdered. The case is handled by Inspector Kulkarni (Murli Sharma). He learns that before Mr. Aggrawal was murdered, he was speaking on the phone to somebody and he mentioned the words ""horse"" and ""grass."" He interprets these words to be some code language. The four arrive at Agrawal's residence. Kulkarni demands to see the painting. Seeing the horse and grass on the painting, he immediately arrests them."
"On the highway, Kulkarni drops the four on the road after realizing that they are innocent. The four are overjoyed until they suddenly witness a car accident of Don Bose (Prem Chopra). He tells them that he has hidden a treasure of 10 crore in the St. Sebastian garden in Goa under a big 'W'. He tells them to divide the money equally among themselves and then dies. They come across Inspector Kabir Nayak (Sanjay Dutt) who has been trying to arrest Bose for the past ten years. He tries to extract information from the four but in vain, they escape from there and decide to travel to Goa. Desperate for his promotion, Kabir is determined to capture the four. All four friends steal Boman's car which belongs to his father Nari (Asrani), who loves his car more than his son and threw his son out after he damaged his car. The friends manage to steal their car but not before hitting Nari on the head and making him unconscious. Roy loses control of the car in a forest and hits it against a tree, breaking both headlights. They decide to spend the night in the car. The next day Kabir is transferred to Yavatmal for failing to capture Bose. Furious he walks towards his table where Nari is waiting for him to file a complaint against his son for stealing his car. He gives Kabir the photos of Boman and his car. Meanwhile, all four come across a broken bridge which is the only way through the forest. They decide to jump the car but Boman is reluctant to do so. They manage to jump the car on the other side but it blasts off."
"Kabir tracks the four down after discovering the destroyed car. He is able to learn the location of the treasure due to Manav's dumbness. He ties all four of them to a tree and sets off. However they manage to escape and it is revealed that Roy had actually cut the engine wires of Kabir's car so he must have not gone too far. They reach a dhabha and pretend to be detectives. They make the villagers believe that Kabir is a member of the Pasha gang and lures them to capture him for the reward would be Rs. 15 lakhs. Kabir defeats the villagers and he and the four arrive at a settlement - 60% would belong to the four and 40% would belong to Kabir. But Boman insists on having his money separately for damaging his car from the rest of the three. Consequently, a fight ensues and is decided that whoever reaches the treasure first would take all the money."
"All four part ways and try to reach Goa as soon as possible. Roy encounters a dacoit Babubhai (Sanjay Mishra) and agree to divide the money among themselves provided they reach Goa as soon as possible. Boman also encounters his father. Though Nari initially wants to kill his son, changes his mind after he learns about the ten crores. Adi and Manav travel together. Kabir nearly escapes death as he hangs off a cliff and is rescued by some school children whose school bus he stole. All of them go through a series of humorous adventures before reaching Goa. All of them except Kabir reach the garden at the same time. Finally Roy explains that it is useless finding the treasure alone and all agree to find the money together. They all search for the big 'W'. Manav is able to locate the Palm trees which make the shape of a 'W' when a crow defecates on Adi. But Kabir arrives there and tells them to divide the money against them to which all agree. They dig there and are able to find the money. But again a fight ensues over the payment for the damage of the car. All are enraged when Adi and Manav decide to pay the money as one unit but are separate units while taking money. The fight goes on during which Kabir takes all the money and runs. He tries to escape in a hot air balloon on a beach but finds it tied to a pole. He dives in an effort to cut the rope but is beaten up by the rest who pursue him. The balloon blows off shore and all are disheartened. Conditions change when the wind changes direction and the balloon again blows onshore. They follow the balloon in a towing van. The balloon clashes against a pole and the bag falls down. All of them try to collect as much money as they can when suddenly some spot lights focus on them and a crowd cheers loudly behind them. They are actually standing in stage where a function is being held by an organisation named 'Help Orphans'. Seeing the money everybody thinks they have come here to donate money. All of them get emotional and all decide to donate the money for the orphans. The film ends on a happy note conveying that the fate of the money was already decided. It never belonged to the four friends. They were just a medium which helped the money reach its true destination."
"The film's soundtrack is composed by Adnan Sami with lyrics penned by Sameer. The songs, ""Dekho Dekho"" and ""Miss India Marthi Mujhpe"", were both known as the title song, since the main chorus of both the songs included the title ""Dhamaal""."

"Soyarabai was a saint from the Mahar caste in 14th century Maharashtra, India. She was a disciple of her husband, Chokhamela."
"Soyarabai framed large literature using blank verse of her own devising. She wrote much but only about 62 works are known. In her Abhang she refers to herself as Chokhamela's Mahari, accuses god for forgetting Dalits and of making life bad. Her most basic verses concern the simple food she gives the god. Her poems describe her devotion towards god and voice her objections to untouchability."
"Soyarabai believed that ""The body only can be impure or polluted, but the soul is ever clean, pure knowledge. The body is born unclean and so how can anybody claim to be pure in body? The body has much pollution. But the pollution of the body remains in the body. The soul is untouched by it."""
Soyarabai undertook an annual pilgrimage to Pandharpur with her husband. They were harassed by orthodox Brahmins but never lost their faith and peace of mind.
= = = Atmospheric optics ray-tracing codes = = =
Atmospheric optics ray tracing codes - this article list codes for light scattering using ray-tracing technique to study atmospheric optics phenomena such as rainbows and halos. Such particles can be large raindrops or hexagonal ice crystals. Such codes are one of many approaches to calculations of light scattering by particles.
"Ray tracing techniques can be applied to study light scattering by spherical and non-spherical particles under the condition that the size of a particle is much larger than the wavelength of light. The light can be considered as collection of separate rays with width of rays much larger than the wavelength but smaller than a particle. Rays hitting the particle undergoes reflection, refraction and diffraction. These rays exit in various directions with different amplitudes and phases. Such ray tracing techniques are used to describe optical phenomena such as rainbow of halo on hexagonal ice crystals for large particles."
Review of several mathematical techniques is provided in series of publications.
The 46° halo was first explained as being caused by refractions through ice crystals in 1679 by the French physicist Edmé Mariotte (1620–1684) in terms of light refraction
Jacobowitz in 1971 was the first to apply the ray-tracing technique to hexagonal ice crystal. Wendling et al. (1979) extended Jacobowitz's work from hexagonal ice particle with infinite length to finite length and combined Monte Carlo technique to the ray-tracing simulations.
"The compilation contains information about the electromagnetic scattering by hexagonal ice crystals, large raindrops, and relevant links and applications."

Basically, this album gave me a chance to breathe and breathe fire on mothafuckas I’ve been wanting to breathe fire on. So it’s really giving me a little outlet right now. Once I whack niggas on this mothafuckin’ album then I’m gonna fall back on they ass and just chill for the summertime, get my dick sucked and drink drinks with umbrellas and shit in them, nigga. Just like Tony Soprano said, niggas is getting wacked. Niggas is getting’ clipped. This album is strictly for niggas that’s getting they nuts clipped."" On May 14, 2013, Freddie Gibbs announced that his debut album ""ESGN"" would be released in July.

He produced that. It’s showing people that I’m the staple of the game when it comes to Gary [Indiana]. Michael Jackson is dead, so I gotta pick up the torch and run with it for my city. Actually, I am the only person grabbing it. I am just doing what I got to do. I’m the eastside moonwalker. I stay high, baby.” He also spoke about “Freddie Soprano”, saying: ""That’s the definitive verse from the album. Basically, telling y’all what it is. How I feel about what’s what."" He spoke about “F.A.M.E.” which features Daz Dillinger and Spice 1, saying: ""[The acronym stands for] ‘Fuck All My Enemies.’ You know who I am talking about. If you an enemy—fuck you. I grew up listening to Daz and Spice-1. If it wasn’t for guys like that, I wouldn’t be rapping. Any project I do, I try to pay homage to guys that I respect. Last project I fucked with Jadakiss. He's one of the guys that when I came up, I came up listening to. He's still an athlete in this game. He's still one of the best in it. He don’t get his credit. I always try to pay homage to the guys that were instrumental in my career with me coming up. That's why I linked up with Daz and Spice-1. [This is a diss] track to anybody who want it. If the shoe fits, wear it. I’m talking shit about all of you niggas. If the shoe fits, wear it. If you pick up the shoe and you put it on. You want to take to Twitter and you want to get on your track and say something about Freddie Gibbs, make sure you got your hardhat on."" He spoke about “Lay It Down” which is produced by Willie B, saying: ""Shout out to Willie B. He fuck with Jay Rock and them. He produced that shit. That’s one of them hard-hitting joints. It’s going straight to the point. Lay it down. That’s a robbing song."" He also spoke about “Have U Seen Her” which features Hit Skrewface, saying: ""This is featuring my boy Screwface. SMKA, they produced that. That’s one of them bangers. It’s hard.”"
"""ESGN"" received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, which indicates ""generally favorable reviews"", based on 5 reviews. Anthony Asencio of HipHopDX gave the album three and a half stars out of five, saying ""Ultimately, ""ESGN"" may not be a cultural event. It doesn’t introduce a new sound, nor does it feature many moments we haven’t heard before. Yet what makes this album important are all the reasons Hip Hop needs Freddie Gibbs. On any one album, he can give you pieces of Tupac, UGK, Three 6 Mafia, and blend them into a harmony that would make Bone Thugs-n-Harmony proud. And on that point, ESGN is a massive success."" Chris Mench of ""XXL"" gave the album an L, saying ""None of this criticism is to say that ""ESGN"" is a bad album. Freddie is a talented rapper with great flow and a wise selection of collaborators, and many songs are individually effective. Rather, it is simply an album that lacks a clear perspective on the many heavy topics it tackles. A first time listener may walk away feeling very familiar with Freddie Gibbs’ sound, but still unsure of who exactly he is."" David Amidon of PopMatters gave the album a seven out of ten, saying ""For those hip-hop fans forever in pursuit of the latest glass-shattering bass and semi-auto mob rules, ""ESGN"" is likely 2013’s flagship release. This is Gibbs’ deep breath; let's see what direction he takes off running in next."""
"Chris Bosman of Consequence of Sound gave the album four out of five stars, saying ""Gibbs’ EPs and mixtapes tend to run long, and ""ESGN"" – at 19 tracks — is no exception. The length is a weakness. The bleakness of Gibbs’ world, even when it's going well, can leave you gasping. The shock is somewhat lost in the number of tracks. In the scheme of the album, it's a minor quibble. ""ESGN"" digs new paths through rap's hallowed grounds. It may not be the crossover success that those who ride for Gibbs would love to see, but it doesn’t diminish this excellent record."" Jonah Bromwich of Pitchfork Media gave the album a 6.9 out of 10, saying ""On “Hundred Thousand"", Gibbs supplies a perfect—and, true to form, concise—review of ""ESGN"" himself. “Ain’t trying to be the man, just trying to maintain.” Callin an album ""more of the same"" sounds dismissive but its something that fans are often happy to receive and there are those for whom 20 tracks of Gibbs rapping nearly perfectly will be enough. But for everyone else, ""ESGN"" comes as an unwelcome reversion to the mean. It's the sound of a rapper more than happy to maintain his narrow lane after being burned by the industry, one who's lost the ambition to leave his comfort zone, at least for the time being."""

""Life Got Cold"" was promoted through various live performances and has since been performed on three of Girls Aloud's concert tours. Described as a ""surprisingly poignant"", the melancholic ballad received favorable reviews from contemporary music critics; however, it was criticised for its similarities with Oasis."
"""Life Got Cold"" is a ballad written in D minor. The chord progressions vary throughout the song but the different chords include B, C, Dm, Gm, and Am. Following typical verse-chorus form, the song consists of a verse followed by a bridge and chorus. The verses are ""talk-sung"", while the bridge and chorus are song over guitar strumming. The middle 8 is a slower version of the bridge. The song tells the tale of young love that ended ""when summer slipped away."" ""Life Got Cold"" was a late addition to ""Sound of the Underground"", completed by Xenomania shortly before the album's release. Producer Brian Higgins did not take the idea of a Girls Aloud version of the song seriously until he heard the group sing it, because a track working ""has always got to be based on an artist's performance, not the music itself. But they sang it, and they really nailed the melancholic aspect of it, and it sounded beautiful."" The lyrics focus on ""the directionlessness of modern life."""
"The song received attention because of similarities between the guitar riff of ""Life Got Cold"" and that of the 1995 Oasis hit ""Wonderwall"". A BBC review stated ""part of the chorus sounds like it is going to turn into Wonderwall by Oasis."" A source told ""The Sun"" that Girls Aloud ""are all big Oasis fans so I'm sure they won't mind comparisons with their classic love song."" Warner/Chappell Music has since credited Oasis songwriter Noel Gallagher. Girls Aloud later made a cameo appearance in Oasis' 2007 rockumentary ""Lord Don't Slow Me Down""."
"""Life Got Cold"" was not originally the choice for Girls Aloud's third single. Polydor Records had originally chosen ""Some Kind of Miracle"" to be released, but the plan was dropped after an overwhelming fan response to ""Life Got Cold"". The single was released on 18 August 2003 in the UK. It was available on two different CD single formats and as a cassette tape. The first CD featured a cover of the Duran Duran song ""Girls on Film"" as the b-side, which would later become the title for a Girls Aloud DVD, as well as a remix of ""No Good Advice"". The disc's enhanced section features the ""Life Got Cold"" music video and a photo gallery. The second disc included both the radio edit and album version of ""Life Got Cold"", as well as the 29 Palms Remix Edit and the Stella Browne Edit. It also came with a free fold-out poster. The cassette also featured an exclusive b-side, an original track entitled ""Lights, Music, Camera, Action"". The photos featured on the single's artwork were reshot at the last minute, following the group's request."
"""Life Got Cold"" received positive reviews from music critics, although it did receive criticism due to the similarities with the song Wonderwall by Oasis. BBC called the song a ""charming ballad"" that was ""a sweet but slightly sad pop song."" RTÉ.ie thought ""Life Got Cold"" was ""surprisingly poignant."""
"However, some noted that the chorus held many similarities to that of the Oasis song ""Wonderwall"". The songwriters dismissed claims of plagiarising Oasis. Allmusic referred to it as ""a solid ballad, suggesting a less intellectual Dido."""
"The song entered the UK Singles Chart at number three, behind Blu Cantrell's ""Breathe"" and Lemar's ""Dance (With U)"". It spent a second week in the top ten, slipping to number eight. The song spent a total of nine weeks in the top 75 overall, a far cry from the fourteen weeks ""No Good Advice"" or the twenty-one weeks that ""Sound of the Underground"" spent in the chart. ""Life Got Cold"" also debuted at number three on the Irish Singles Chart, but managed to rise to number two the following week. It spent two further weeks in the top ten, then two weeks in the top twenty. The single barely missed the top ten of the Netherlands Top 40, instead peaking at number eleven. It has since become the group's 16th best selling single domestically."
"The music video for ""Life Got Cold"" was directed by Phil Griffin, who previously directed the videos for ""Sound of the Underground"" and ""No Good Advice"". The band members are seen in stunted movement, wandering around an abandoned city setting. Both group and individual shots are shown in various scenes. Nadine Coyle is seen in front of an abandoned building, while Sarah Harding is next to a car and a phone booth. Nicola Roberts is alone in a kitchen as pouring rain can be seen on the window. Cheryl Cole is shown in an alleyway, while Kimberley Walsh is alone on a street curb. The group are shown together on an abandoned bus, in an alley at night, and sat in front of the abandoned building. The video has a slightly blue hue to it, suggesting coldness and darkness. It also makes use of lens flares."
"The video can be found on two of Girls Aloud's official DVD releases, ""Girls on Film"" (2005) and ""Style"" (2007)."
"""Life Got Cold"" was first performed live by Girls Aloud at two summer festivals in 2003, Pop Beach and Live & Loud. The first televised performance occurred on """" on 19 July 2003. The group performed in black-and-white business casual attire, as seen in the music video and on the single's artwork. They performed on ""CD:UK"" once more the following month, although Cheryl was absent due to illness. Girls Aloud also appeared on ""Diggin' It"", ""Popworld"", ""Top of the Pops"" and ""Top of the Pops Saturday"" (twice)."
"Girls Aloud performed ""Life Got Cold"" on three of their concert tours. For 2005's What Will the Neighbours Say? Live, Girls Aloud were positioned at the top of a staircase as they sang the song in colourful, simple evening gowns. The song was given a reggae reworking for 2007's The Sound of Girls Aloud: The Greatest Hits Tour. The song was also included on the bands reunion tour, Ten - The Hits Tour 2013."
