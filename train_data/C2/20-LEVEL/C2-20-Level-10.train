At this work experience .
In .
Do they?
I asked for some once.
You did?
"No, I never pick up the phone, they do that, pick up one phone and speak for a minute, while that ones ringing they say hold on a minute, and pick up the other one."
What's it about then?
", it's only about this erm, I have to do the practice."
Huh?
Have to do the practice.

You should  at Peter's.
I don't know Peter's .
"No, I don't actually."
Cos I don't know his  can't do it.
Quit easy though isn't it?
"All you do is, stick it through, phone your number, push the button, it's gone through."
I get fed up doing the .
"Yeah, but, even when you leave school that's what happens don't it?"
"I, I mean you usually start off with the boy  everybody has to start at the bottom,."
.
you know?
They never asked me
if they could  or the flue in so it's
"That's right, say it like that!"
never been  repaired.
neglecting the .
"Well having said, what, what is it all about?"
"It's because  the  no, no water heater should be in the bathrooms!"
So where's that gonna go then?
"Well it must either go in the kitchen or in the cupboard somewhere, but you know?"
That's what they've er  put it to.
what you said to me.
Oh yeah.
Oh well we'll have to move won't we?
Yeah.
"It's working, like gas-wise, like I say, it is  it's virtually, it's just the ventilation clearing out the  the fumes  which are given"
Mm.
off from it.
Do you see what I mean?
"Well it is  isn't there a, there's a chimney above there isn't there?"
Yeah.
"That's right, yeah, but  but now  like I said, you're gonna have to , to have your certain pipes."
"Like, have you seen them all going round?"
They got long poles on the back step.
Will it'll be longer than that ?
No  cos they haven't done this one  because it shouldn't be in here!
Even in the fire?
Yeah.
Right.
"Yeah, I mean, it shouldn't be in here, like, that's why they haven't  that's why they've put it there."
That's why they hung on the to the shipment cos these aren't supposed to be in  the bathrooms.
Right.
No bloody way he said!
Did he?
"I thought to myself well yo if Laura had a house and then thought Pete was in that in that position, I'd of helped him."
Did he really?
Yeah  well they've had they've had a big  today.
Who have?
.
Oh?
Well I thought she said I ain't gotta  then have they?
A hundred pou thous thousand in debt  they had two lo two bloody great Morgan cars!
About what was that?
Well I reckon that's her  either his mother or her mother.
Yeah.
Cos when I was coming home from Pete's  a bloke stopped me  er  whatever's that noise?
I dunno.
A bloke stopped and he said er  can you tell me where  is?
"I said well you're in the   oh he said I'll tell you what I want, a little black and white house  I said it's just there look  I said nearly you're nearly on top!"
"He got a few yards down, he said  so I said well  have yo you haven't come round to view the house today have you?"
"Oh no he said, I said because they got a funeral on, he said that's what we've coming for, we're coming to pick granddad up."
Oh.
Well I thought well I didn't want people going round there
No.
"Well  that was a waste of their time if they'd have gone round there to view them, weren't it?"
Yeah.
So that  was not having a lot of flipping luck is she?
No.
But they haven't put them out their home.
No.
"Alright, but I think they've gotta re-house them first haven't they?"
I dunno.
"Well yeah they just shove you out on the street, they gotta  especially if you got children they gotta re-house you."
Yeah.
Yeah but well you look that  that jaguar  four litres!
. Four litre car!
Yeah but what are you gonna do with four litres?
I dunno.
Well quite.
It does about  eighteen miles to the gallon.
How many miles do we do to the gallon?
I hope we do something like thirty six.
Thirty six!
Don't think it's much more than that.
"How can his, well  if ours is one point six  there's three times"
No it doesn't work that way.
It doesn't work like that?
No.
So what  how long will it take him to get eighty miles filling up every ?
Well I mean do they have huge tanks?
"I mean they take  if you, if you filled up you could put I think it's about twenty six gallons in that car."
And how many can we put in?
Nine?
Eleven?
Cor.
Eleven.
"It was eight, nine."
I think this might take eleven.
So how much do they spend if they filled it ?
"Don't forget if you've got all that weight, you've got that you're gonna lose even more petrol."
"So if you filled that up, how much would that cost them?"
"Well, twenty six  I think it's something like  isn't it something like two pounds a gallon now?"
"You don't, they do it all by litres now so it's really hard"
About fifty P?
"About fifty, fifty pounds?"
Fifty pounds to fill up!
How am I gonna get them in the van?
What van?
"In, back into the caravan."
On me own.
Oh.
"It's a double mattress, a double bedded mattress."
I can't bloody lift that.
So the only thing that I would suggest is to
Well still Mark will be  there.
Or he could come down with you on Saturday?
Or Sally maybe would be able to come down with you Saturday and help you?
Unless we went over the same day that Susan went over.
And kept the mattresses till Susan goes.
But the understanding is  that like Mark has got the caravan this week.
Mm.
"But if they had a booking to go into it, Mark's gotta get out."
Oh well he could ring you up and you could take them back down but at least they would be dried.
Cos if anybody  who could they come on if they caught cold and and
Well I dunno.
You or him?
I dunno.
It's like fighting a losing battle isn't it?
If someone else
I wouldn't worry at all.
I wouldn't hesitate.
It's an embarrassment for people to come in and catch cold and think it's your mattresses that's done it.
Mm.
"If those men were not working on the gas I would go over there now, and I'd switch the fire and I'd leave it on."
Mm.
Yes.
The thing is old Mark is there to see to it.
Mark won't be there to see to it?
"oh right, oh I didn't realize, there were just two parcels on the erm"
Yeah look
"on the thing and, and I picked them both up"
you see.
I thought they were both for me.
Oh dear.
Ah!
Oh well erm
Yeah I didn't fancy
let's see
going up to the senile
No I don't I don't blame you.
Erm
I sort of started to feel a bit ill before so
Yeah.
Well do er do come in er  well did you have a pleasant trip down?
"Erm yeah it was okay, it wasn't too bad."
Mm.
Alright  cos I think we've been sent these on approval to see if we want to adopt them for course material
Yeah.
you see so erm
They seem quite nice.
Yeah.
"Erm well I, I don't know quite what erm they'll be teaching you out of in your er abnormal course but erm er I do find the, the  the sort of current generation of American textbooks quite erm"
Mm.
"quite a nice, quite exciting erm I tell you what, swivel that swivel chair round and, and sit on that"
Okay.
Do you have a drink please or
Yes of course.
Now erm what sort of flavours appeal?
"Now we've got ordinary tea, we've got herbal tea, we've got coffee out of a coffee machine, we've got Lapsang Souchong, we've got ordinary tea  I've mentioned that already haven't I?"
Erm
Cos a lot of stuff isn't in.
They could be put a manager in and   the benefits.
I suppose they would.
Mm.
Perhaps they do.
And then there's staff there to run it.
I dunno.
"Well the man with the bike, that's his business."
"And the ma and the people then with clothes last year, who were they now?"
To the shop?
Was M was Mark's caravan warm?
"Well he didn't have a fire on, nothing."
He was just lying there watching telly and reading the paper and
Did he have a paper?
Mm.
"Should have brought it back, did you?"
No.
He bought the Saturday one that's got the week  part in it.
Why didn't he come over and fetch the car then?
"Because he said there's no point, I don't want it."
"Well I've got to take his over now, he'll have to bring me back."
Yeah.
"What I was going to tell him, if he was to come over, take my car there  when I'd have taken this car over, I would have had a car to come back."
Well that's what he said.
He said you'd better keep the car there in case his won't be ready or something.
Mm.
Lot of kids about though.
In another couple of weeks  spring then.
Would if the weather would take up.
But still they book regardless of weather don't they?
Mm.
Mm.
"But she said they tell you that and she said they tell you, it's on computer she said, but animals do go in the vans."
"Well I can tell you one thing, animals will not go into ours."
And I tell you she's got a different contract with me altogether.
"You read our contract didn't you, last night?"
It's there in black and white.
"Mm I know, that's what she said."
I don't how she knows.
"If I, if if I found out there was animals in our caravan, I'd take them to town."
But how do you know if you're not there every second?
"You  you for one, like her, when you went to the caravan, you'd smell it like that."
Oh I .
But you'd smell it wouldn't you?
Mm.
And they know this.
"Cos there are dogs there, great big ones."
Yeah.
Mm big white ones.
"That   that man yesterday, he paid six thousand pound for his caravan."
He s he said that on the tape.
Mhm.
I listened to the tape with her last night.
He paid six thousand pound.
We paid fourteen thousand seven hundred for ours.
Mm.
"He hasn't got, ours is a gold golden olympic."
He's not having the rent we're having.
No.
He's got a .
He hasn't got a brand new caravan.
But he nearly gave six thousand pound for it.
That's what they said though.
Yeah I know.
Two ounces as well as all the ginger?
"And puts it into roast in the oven, and takes it out after fifty minutes  and then  you get  Philadelphia cheese and white wine  melt it down in the wine"
Mm mm!
"stirring a bit more  you know, crushed root ginger"
Mm mm.
and that's your sauce to serve on the side.
"I tell, you've never eaten anything like it!"
Is it nice?
I could eat the tail.
Really?
It's gorgeous.
"But i , I keep saying to Michael it's so expensive!"
"I mean root ginger's like a pound a pound, or two pound a pound."
"No, not really."
"It's not, it's not as expensive as it used to be."
It's got more and more popular strangely enough.
But she does ginger tea.
Oops.
So do I?
Oh I haven't drunk ginger tea before.
Well I'll make you ginger tea.
Well we never tried that before.
"But that's sounds what, can I just ask again, so you have a roast chicken yo , and you  mix two"
A pound of Philadelphia cheese.
Yeah.
But she does about two pound of root ginger.
Most normal people would have half a pound at the most.
That's two good roots.
You crush it or do you chop
"Two whole, bash it."
it up?
Bash it?
"And walked round  ah so they er  got a, sort of court bailiff involved."
"For sixty two pound, it must of cost them more than that!"
Cost a lot of money I would of thought.
They obviously don't like him do they?
No  well  erm  it's a big firm so
Perhaps it's
what they did in  is er  .
Yeah but he's got his self a bad name now isn't he?
Yeah.
"It made me laugh when your mum kept on about him last night, about having all his hampers stolen."
Yeah.
Twenty two grand!
Ridiculous innit?
The blokes on the make isn't he?
Yeah.
You see he's  and then he had the cheek to charge me for insurance!
Well I expect him to pay the insurance.
Who did pay the insurance?
"did, but I  gonna give it back."
"Well I should think so,gonna get twenty two grand out of it!"
"Cos he'd have taken them to court and said well he didn't even pay it, I did!"
Well actually they erm  I think the  maximum they'll pay out is eighteen thousand.
Yeah but I don't think that's gonna be such an easy case to .
"Well, I don't."
You know it looks to me
They said they'd got it.
"they think that it's all cut and dry, well  they haven't got the  then people will come round and investigate yet!"
No.
Mum that'll come out on the tape!
Well I can't stop it cos the kettle's boiling!
Don't be silly!
Mum is there any shandy please?
Oh Sari .
Yes I spoke to her .
"Yes, she's definitely going isn't she?"
"Mm, mm."
"Any, anybody else."
Anybody else thinking of going?
Any other offers?
"Cos, cos you're going by car are you or?"
"I'll, I'll drive yeah, so there are three seats spare in my car, vehicle."
So that you  Plymouth .
"Instead of writing a check, send the cheque ."
If you can stand the strain of the noise and diesel engine all that way.
.
All the girls in the back.
"You can get there, you can get there, perhaps, if you can get there"
I've got a seat in the back mate.
"You can get there on motorway, erm, all the way practically, can't you?"

M four .
Right is there anybody else cos we have got forms haven't we?.
.
"It's not that long if that's the case then, er, not that long a journey either."
No.
It's motorway all the way.
"Erm, anybody else interested for it, you said not didn't you."
It's not to late to book I think it says something about surcharge after sixth of March or something on the form doesn't it?
We'll make it  .
I don't think she was in  no.
.
Oh dear god    Those chrysanthemums done well.
"They have, yes  they're er  they're good value those a pot, I mean  but  they're reasonably  when did you get it?"
It must be about three weeks ago.
Can't think what it was for now.
I think it was one of those impromptu ones.
I know  it wasn't my birthday you just came in with it didn't you ?
It's  birthday.
I mean the only trouble is they're no use afterwards are they?
Must have had a brainstorm
I said they're no use afterwards are they?
I don't  I don't know.
Because they're forced I reckon.
Oh.
I think they'll grow if you put them in the garden  eventually.
Well
"Well I mean they won't flower again, that's for certain you see and it's it's gotta be"
"No, well not this year anyway, they  they could"
Oh right.
"Have you got, oh ta look  take this as well."
Yes I'm taking it.
Oh.
I'm going to have a go at this   today.
"They've dried out a bit, been too tacky to do anything with."
"Bye bye chaps, don't let them out."
No  see you then.
Did they try and drag you up the farm yesterday?
"Well he's, he actually was off the lead and he went straight through right to the other gate"
Oh and you kept them off the road did you?
You didn't just er
Oh yes well the gate was open so

Bloody hell.
And that's before the M O T.
Yeah  yeah.
"The other week it cost me fifty quid to go to the, to get it tuned you know?"
"Cars, honest to god."
"You want some money today don't you, just to ruddy  eh?"
They work out twenty five pounds an hour  in garages.
"Oh, oh well  well you don't go there do you, unless you've got   bloody hell."
"Well our M O T guy, fair do   you know and he'll say  so and so wants doing, can you take it away and do it?"
Yeah.

Yeah.
Oh aye.
You do it there they only charge  fifteen is it or something if they do it.
But I mean you know as you just said then they'd wanna charge you per hour it's

beyond the working man.
"Now Shirley, you're still messing about with this little job here."
Well I wanted the sander.

Yes.
"I I I I went to to a place first and er I  and I I went home you know, without them knowing."
mother took me back  by the hair
Mhm.
By my hair.
Did did they know you'd gone home?
Pardon?
Did they know that you went?
No.
No?
"What did your mother say then, was she cross with you?"
"No she said, Oh, she said, What do you want?"
"So I says, I I don't like there I want to go I want to come back."
"So she said, Look here my dear girl, she said, you go back and tell the lady that you"
Do you remember how much they paid you?
Pardon?
well there was a lot of call for that.
Mhm.
"And women worked in that department, whereas the men worked at the huge broadloom"
Mhm.
"looms which are very heavy, very heavy, and through fashion, fashion changing and I mean people don't have these things any more."
A lot of pubs and hotels will do the the their places out in these narrow sections so if one gets worn they can lift it up and
"Mhm, yeah."
replace it.
"But houses, when you're doing a house you, you don't tend to do that now, you just have your broad loom"
Mm.
and fit it in.
So in that relationship
"the d the, the women are redundant as it were."
Yes.
"There only is two, well there are two, one, they do shiftwork."
Mhm.
And mum and Chrissy slept in the car.
"and and th that's ri they were, they, mum was gonna stay at home and I was gonna take you for a ride on the train"
Yeah.
and then mum decided she was going to come so we took the car.
"And we might, might well have been on that train that had the crash."
Yes.
Thank goodness we didn't.
Well it was one of those things wasn't it?
Well it's a good job mum came.
Mm mm.
"I hope, I hope ."
Well we went past the crash and we could see that there was something going on but we weren't sure what it was.
"It happened just after we went past the, just before."
You could see  er  a couple of Land Rovers going down with flashing blue lights and things towards
I
the crossing.
And th th and they would be police ones if they'd got blue lights and
Mm mm.
"so did you, could you hear the sirens?"
No I couldn't.
"But erm  when we, by the time we got into Hull I heard it on the radio what had happened  and we went to the toy fair and then we came back  and there was er  you could see all the ambulances and everything still there."
And the train was there leaning over.
But half of it was still on the rails.
Yes it was the front coaches went off.
Front coaches?
Onto the side I think.
Well what sort of express?
It was erm  well what do you think it would be?
Er  I think it must have been a multiple unit.
That's right.
It was a diesel multiple unit.
And it was before you had your pacers and sprinters.
"Yeah but I mean it depends what sort of bloke he is, and I mean if he is like that"
He  you know what a big head he is.
Yeah but I mean you don't know what he's like to his kids do you?
Well she said he he's done nothing but bully them.
Well then the kid's right ain't he?
"Well  you heard what he said he wants his children to have a good education and he pushes them  all the time, they've gotta  if they do anything"
Yeah.
they've gotta be brilliant at it  But
Yeah.
you see some children ain't got it in them and  you know
Oh yeah.
but you heard what Ashley said about swimming.
Made them  yeah.
"Well, to me if a child has got a   by all means encourage along  but you shouldn't push them into anything cos  later on in life they get a bloody complex about everything  you know if they"
I don't know.
if they've got a job or something they're frightened they're not gonna do well and
"Where do you draw the line between  you know, not sort erm  encouraging and not"
Well I do it all look at  it's the way you say it.
"Well that's what I'm saying, so perhaps the kid was right in what he said."
Well yeah but I wouldn't
Been a bastard to him well
Well would you like your son to say  I think
Well no but I don't to think I am like that with Jonathan.
Well no.
Well I don't like
But he's always been like that with them kids you know yourself  if they do anything it's gotta be done
"Well you know how he is, if you say too much to him, don't do that, don't shout at me!"
He soons  starts squawking and  wiping his eye and stamping about the place  but if he's like that  all the while to them  so what is .
They've all gone off to Fiji.
Who has?
"The parents, he said he was going didn't he?"
Oh him as well?
Cos I wasn't sure of some of the answers.
And that it it's saying which of the following days of action has the group participated in.
I mean cos we haven't really sort of really done a proper day of action have we?
We've done little bits and pieces.
I know we did the returnable bottles.
.
I mean cos and we did that stall on peat but we didn't really take part in the peat day of action did we?
.What do you think?
Fiona and I did the electricity
What  at the supermarket .
Is that the global warming and electricity privatization?
That one?
Was it?
It was erm efficiency  of
Oh fuel and efficiency.
Right that one then.
"Oh we didn't, we didn't do the ozone layer one did we?"
Did you do a stall  on that ozone layer?
We did do something.
With the
"Oh we did, yes."
"with the, with er snow remember?"
That was Christmas last year wasn't it?
Oh yes that was
That was ozone.
Yes it was we did
Oh so I'll put down for that then.
Oh it looks quite good .
Right.
Have you written to your MP about fuel efficiency?
Yes I did.
We did.
`` Will you do as I tell you then ? ''
"`` Yes , I will . ''"
`` Then get Joe on the long-distance at once and tell him to bring out a license and ring tonight . ''
"`` Oh , I could n't , '' wailed the aghast Miranda , `` it -- it would be so -- so indelicate . ''"
Rilla shut her little white teeth together with a snap .
"`` Heaven grant me patience , '' she said under her breath ."
"`` I 'll do it then , '' she said aloud , `` and meanwhile , you go home and make what preparations you can ."
When I ` phone down to you to come up and help me sew come at once . ''
"As soon as Miranda , pallid , scared , but desperately resolved , had gone , Rilla flew to the telephone and put in a long-distance call for Charlottetown ."
"She got through with such surprising quickness that she was convinced Providence approved of her undertaking , but it was a good hour before she could get in touch with Joe Milgrave at his camp ."
"Meanwhile , she paced impatiently about , and prayed that when she did get Joe there would be no listeners on the line to carry news to Whiskers-on-the-moon ."
"`` Is that you , Joe ?"
"Rilla Blythe is speaking -- Rilla -- Rilla -- oh , never mind ."
Listen to this .
"Before you come home tonight get a marriage license -- a marriage license -- yes , a marriage license -- and a wedding-ring ."
Did you get that ?
And will you do it ?
"Very well , be sure you do it -- it is your only chance . ''"
Flushed with triumph -- for her only fear was that she might not be able to locate Joe in time -- Rilla rang the Pryor ring .
This time she had not such good luck for she drew Whiskers-on-the-moon .
`` Is that Miranda ?
Oh -- Mr. Pryor !
"Well , Mr. Pryor , will you kindly ask Miranda if she can come up this afternoon and help me with some sewing ."
"It is very important , or I would not trouble her ."
Oh -- thank you . ''
"Mr. Pryor had consented somewhat grumpily , but he had consented -- he did not want to offend Dr. Blythe , and he knew that if he refused to allow Miranda to do any Red Cross work public opinion would make the Glen too hot for comfort ."
"Rilla went out to the kitchen , shut all the doors with a mysterious expression which alarmed Susan , and then said solemnly , `` Susan can you make a wedding-cake this afternoon ? ''"
`` A wedding-cake ! ''
Susan stared .
"Rilla had , without any warning , brought her a war-baby once upon a time ."
"Was she now , with equal suddenness , going to produce a husband ?"
"`` Yes , a wedding-cake -- a scrumptious wedding-cake , Susan -- a beautiful , plummy , eggy , citron-peely wedding-cake ."
`` He wished Miranda many happy returns of the day .
"She did not look very happy , but perhaps you could not expect that under the circumstances . ''"
"`` Anyhow , '' thought Rilla , `` I can write a perfectly killing account of it all to the boys ."
How Jem will howl over Sir Wilfrid 's part in it ! ''
But if Rilla was rather disappointed in the war wedding she found nothing lacking on Friday morning when Miranda said good-bye to her bridegroom at the Glen station .
"The dawn was white as a pearl , clear as a diamond ."
Behind the station the balsamy copse of young firs was frost-misted .
The cold moon of dawn hung over the westering snow fields but the golden fleeces of sunrise shone above the maples up at Ingleside .
Joe took his pale little bride in his arms and she lifted her face to his .
Rilla choked suddenly .
It did not matter that Miranda was insignificant and commonplace and flat-featured .
It did not matter that she was the daughter of Whiskers-on-the-moon .
"All that mattered was that rapt , sacrificial look in her eyes -- that ever-burning , sacred fire of devotion and loyalty and fine courage that she was mutely promising Joe she and thousands of other women would keep alive at home while their men held the Western front ."
"Rilla walked away , realising that she must not spy on such a moment ."
"She went down to the end of the platform where Sir Wilfrid and Dog Monday were sitting , looking at each other ."
Sir Wilfrid remarked condescendingly : `` Why do you haunt this old shed when you might lie on the hearthrug at Ingleside and live on the fat of the land ?
Is it a pose ?
Or a fixed idea ? ''
"Whereat Dog Monday , laconically : `` I have a tryst to keep . ''"
When the train had gone Rilla rejoined the little trembling Miranda .
"`` Well , he 's gone , '' said Miranda , `` and he may never come back -- but I 'm his wife , and I 'm going to be worthy of him ."
I 'm going home . ''
`` Do n't you think you had better come with me now ? ''
asked Rilla doubtfully .
Nobody knew yet how Mr. Pryor had taken the matter .
`` No .
"If Joe can face the Huns I guess I can face father , '' said Miranda daringly ."
`` A soldier 's wife ca n't be a coward .
"Come on , Wilfy ."
I 'll go straight home and meet the worst . ''
"There was nothing very dreadful to face , however ."
"Perhaps Mr. Pryor had reflected that housekeepers were hard to get and that there were many Milgrave homes open to Miranda -- also , that there was such a thing as a separation allowance ."
"When she reached the yard at Green Gables Mrs. Lynde 's loud , decided tones floated out through the open kitchen window ."
"`` Mrs. Lynde has come up to give me good advice about tomorrow , '' thought Anne with a grimace , `` but I do n't believe I 'll go in ."
"Her advice is much like pepper , I think ... excellent in small quantities but rather scorching in her doses ."
I 'll run over and have a chat with Mr. Harrison instead . ''
This was not the first time Anne had run over and chatted with Mr. Harrison since the notable affair of the Jersey cow .
"She had been there several evenings and Mr. Harrison and she were very good friends , although there were times and seasons when Anne found the outspokenness on which he prided himself rather trying ."
"Ginger still continued to regard her with suspicion , and never failed to greet her sarcastically as `` redheaded snippet . ''"
"Mr. Harrison had tried vainly to break him of the habit by jumping excitedly up whenever he saw Anne coming and exclaiming , `` Bless my soul , here 's that pretty little girl again , '' or something equally flattering ."
But Ginger saw through the scheme and scorned it .
Anne was never to know how many compliments Mr. Harrison paid her behind her back .
He certainly never paid her any to her face .
"`` Well , I suppose you 've been back in the woods laying in a supply of switches for tomorrow ? ''"
was his greeting as Anne came up the veranda steps .
"`` No , indeed , '' said Anne indignantly ."
She was an excellent target for teasing because she always took things so seriously .
"`` I shall never have a switch in my school , Mr. Harrison ."
"Of course , I shall have to have a pointer , but I shall use it for pointing ONLY . ''"
`` So you mean to strap them instead ?
"Well , I do n't know but you 're right ."
"A switch stings more at the time but the strap smarts longer , that 's a fact . ''"
`` I shall not use anything of the sort .
I 'm not going to whip my pupils . ''
"`` Bless my soul , '' exclaimed Mr. Harrison in genuine astonishment , `` how do you lay out to keep order then ? ''"
"`` I shall govern by affection , Mr. Harrison . ''"
"`` It wo n't do , '' said Mr. Harrison , `` wo n't do at all , Anne ."
` Spare the rod and spoil the child . '
When I went to school the master whipped me regular every day because he said if I was n't in mischief just then I was plotting it . ''
"`` Methods have changed since your schooldays , Mr. Harrison . ''"
`` But human nature has n't .
"Mark my words , you 'll never manage the young fry unless you keep a rod in pickle for them ."
The thing is impossible . ''
"`` Well , I 'm going to try my way first , '' said Anne , who had a fairly strong will of her own and was apt to cling very tenaciously to her theories ."
I do n't believe in whipping children MUCH .
"I think , as you say , Anne , that there are better ways of managing as a rule , and that corporal punishment should be a last resort ."
"But on the other hand , as Jane says , I believe there is an occasional child who ca n't be influenced in any other way and who , in short , needs a whipping and would be improved by it ."
Corporal punishment as a last resort is to be my rule . ''
"Gilbert , having tried to please both sides , succeeded , as is usual and eminently right , in pleasing neither ."
Jane tossed her head .
`` I 'll whip my pupils when they 're naughty .
It 's the shortest and easiest way of convincing them . ''
Anne gave Gilbert a disappointed glance .
"`` I shall never whip a child , '' she repeated firmly ."
`` I feel sure it is n't either right or necessary . ''
`` Suppose a boy sauced you back when you told him to do something ? ''
said Jane .
"`` I 'd keep him in after school and talk kindly and firmly to him , '' said Anne ."
`` There is some good in every person if you can find it .
It is a teacher 's duty to find and develop it .
"That is what our School Management professor at Queen 's told us , you know ."
Do you suppose you could find any good in a child by whipping him ?
"It 's far more important to influence the children aright than it is even to teach them the three R 's , Professor Rennie says . ''"
"`` But the Inspector examines them in the three R 's , mind you , and he wo n't give you a good report if they do n't come up to his standard , '' protested Jane ."
"`` I 'd rather have my pupils love me and look back to me in after years as a real helper than be on the roll of honor , '' asserted Anne decidedly ."
"`` Would n't you punish children at all , when they misbehaved ? ''"
asked Gilbert .
"`` Oh , yes , I suppose I shall have to , although I know I 'll hate to do it ."
But you can keep them in at recess or stand them on the floor or give them lines to write . ''
`` I suppose you wo n't punish the girls by making them sit with the boys ? ''
said Jane slyly .
Gilbert and Anne looked at each other and smiled rather foolishly .
"Once upon a time , Anne had been made to sit with Gilbert for punishment and sad and bitter had been the consequences thereof ."
"`` Well , time will tell which is the best way , '' said Jane philosophically as they parted ."
"Anne went back to Green Gables by way of Birch Path , shadowy , rustling , fern-scented , through Violet Vale and past Willowmere , where dark and light kissed each other under the firs , and down through Lover 's Lane ... spots she and Diana had so named long ago ."
"She walked slowly , enjoying the sweetness of wood and field and the starry summer twilight , and thinking soberly about the new duties she was to take up on the morrow ."
I must not even come here any more .
You understand that ? ''
`` Yes . ''
There was an unconscious revelation in the girl 's mournful eyes as she turned them on Alan .
It thrilled him to the core of his being .
She loved him .
"If it were not for that empty marriage form , he could win her , but the knowledge was only an added mocking torment ."
Alan had not known a man could endure such misery and live .
A score of wild questions rushed to his lips but he crushed them back for Lynde 's sake and held out his hand .
"`` Good-bye , dear , '' he said almost steadily , daring to say no more lest he should say too much ."
"`` Good-bye , '' Lynde answered faintly ."
When he had gone she flung herself down on the moss by the spring and lay there in an utter abandonment of misery and desolation .
Pain and indignation struggled for mastery in Alan 's stormy soul as he walked homeward .
So this was Captain Anthony 's doings !
He had sacrificed his daughter to some crime of his dubious past .
Alan never dreamed of blaming Lynde for having kept her marriage a secret ; he put the blame where it belonged -- on the Captain 's shoulders .
Captain Anthony had never warned him by so much as a hint that Lynde was not free to be won .
It had all probably seemed a good joke to him .
Alan thought the furtive amusement he had so often detected in the Captain 's eyes was explained now .
He found Elder Trewin in his study when he got home .
The good Elder 's face was stern and anxious ; he had called on a distasteful errand -- to tell the young minister of the scandal his intimacy with the Four Winds people was making in the congregation and remonstrate with him concerning it .
"Alan listened absently , with none of the resentment he would have felt at the interference a day previously ."
A man does not mind a pin-prick when a limb is being wrenched away .
"`` I can promise you that my objectionable calls at Four Winds will cease , '' he said sarcastically , when the Elder had finished ."
"Elder Trewin got himself away , feeling snubbed but relieved ."
"`` Took it purty quiet , '' he reflected ."
`` Do n't believe there was much in the yarns after all .
Isabel King started them and probably she exaggerated a lot .
I suppose he 's had some notion like as not of bringing the Captain over to the church .
"But that 's foolish , for he 'd never manage it , and meanwhile was giving occasion for gossip ."
It 's just as well to stop it .
"He 's a good pastor and he works hard -- too hard , mebbe ."
"But I have been going to see Madge Oliver for some time , and we are engaged ."
"We are thinking of being married this fall , and we hope you will not object . ''"
Burton 's frankness nearly took away his father 's breath .
Old John fairly choked with rage .
"`` You young fool , '' he spluttered , bringing down his hoe with such energy that he sliced off half a dozen of his finest young turnip plants , `` have you gone clean crazy ?"
"No , sir , I 'll never consent to your marrying an Oliver , and you need n't have any idea that I will . ''"
"`` Then I 'll marry her without your consent , '' retorted Burton angrily , losing the temper he had been trying to keep ."
"`` Oh , will you indeed !"
"Well , if you do , out you go , and not a cent of my money or a rod of my land do you ever get . ''"
`` What have you got against Madge ? ''
"asked Burton , forcing himself to speak calmly , for he knew his father too well to doubt for a minute that he meant and would do just what he said ."
"`` She 's an Oliver , '' said old John crustily , `` and that 's enough . ''"
"And considering that he had settled the matter , John Ellis threw down his hoe and left the field in a towering rage ."
Burton hoed away savagely until his anger had spent itself on the weeds .
"Give up Madge -- dear , sweet little Madge ?"
Not he !
"Yet if his father remained of the same mind , their marriage was out of the question at present ."
And Burton knew quite well that his father would remain of the same mind .
Old John Ellis had the reputation of being the most contrary man in Greenwood .
When Burton had finished his row he left the turnip field and went straight across lots to see Madge and tell her his dismal story .
"An hour later Miss Susan Oliver went up the stairs of her little brown house to Madge 's room and found her niece lying on the bed , her pretty curls tumbled , her soft cheeks flushed crimson , crying as if her heart would break ."
"Miss Susan was a tall , grim , angular spinster who looked like the last person in the world to whom a love affair might be confided ."
But never were appearances more deceptive than in this case .
"Behind her unprepossessing exterior Miss Susan had a warm , sympathetic heart filled to the brim with kindly affection for her pretty niece ."
She had seen Burton Ellis going moodily across the fields homeward and guessed that something had gone wrong .
"`` Now , dearie , what is the matter ? ''"
"she said , tenderly patting the brown head ."
Madge sobbed out the whole story disconsolately .
Burton 's father would not let him marry her because she was an Oliver .
"And , oh , what would she do ?"
"`` Do n't worry , Madge , '' said Miss Susan comfortingly ."
`` I 'll soon settle old John Ellis . ''
They then quarrelled ; the cause of the quarrel was insignificant ; with anyone else than Eugene a reconciliation would soon have been effected .
But Eugene never was friendly with your father from that time .
I think he was jealous of old Grandfather 's affection ; thought the old man loved your father best .
"And then , as I have said , he was very eccentric and stubborn ."
"Well , your father went away to college and graduated , and then -- we were married ."
Grandfather Page was very angry with him for marrying me .
He wanted him to marry somebody else .
He told him he would disinherit him if he married me .
I did not know this until we were married .
But Grandfather Page kept his word .
"He sent for a lawyer and had a new will made , leaving everything to Eugene ."
"I think , nay , I am sure , that he would have relented in time , but he died the very next week ; they found him dead in his bed one morning , so Eugene got everything ; and that is all there is of the story , Dorinda . ''"
`` And Uncle Eugene has been our enemy ever since ? ''
"`` Yes , ever since ."
"So you see , Dorinda dear , that I can not ask any favours of Uncle Eugene . ''"
"`` Yes , I see , '' said Dorinda understandingly ."
"We kept thinking of poor Laura and Magsie at home , dining off potatoes on Thanksgiving !"
But at least Aunt Susanna was satisfied .
When Kate and I were washing the dishes she came out quite beamingly .
"`` Well , my dears , I must admit that you made a very good job of the dinner , indeed ."
The turkey was done to perfection .
"As for the mince pies -- well , of course Miranda Mary made them , but she must have had extra good luck with them , for they were excellent and heated to just the right degree ."
"You did n't give anything to the McGinnis dog , I hope ? ''"
"`` No , we did n't give him anything , '' said Kate ."
Aunt Susanna did not notice the emphasis .
When we had finished the dishes we smuggled our platter and tureen out of the house and went home .
Laura and Margaret were busy painting and studying and were just as sweet-tempered as if we had n't robbed them of their dinner .
But we had to tell them the whole story before we even took off our hats .
"`` There is a special Providence for children and idiots , '' said Laura gently ."
We did n't ask her whether she meant us or Tony McGinnis or both .
There are some things better left in obscurity .
I 'd have probably said something much sharper than that if anybody had made off with my Thanksgiving turkey so unceremoniously .
By the most curious coincidence he had opened his heart to me too .
"Being a man , he was n't so discursive as Anne ; he said his say in four pages , but I could read the heartache between the lines ."
He wrote that he was going to Klondike and would start in a month 's time .
He was sick of living now that he 'd lost Anne .
"He said he loved her better than his life and always would , and could never forget her , but he knew she did n't care anything about him now after the way she 'd acted , and he wanted to get as far away from her and the torturing thought of her as he could ."
"So he was going to Klondike -- going to Klondike , Nora May , when his mother was writing to him to come home every week and Anne was breaking her heart for him at St. Mary 's ."
"Well , I folded up them letters and , says I , `` Grandpa Holland , I guess my birthday celebration is here ready to hand . ''"
I thought real hard .
I could n't write myself to explain to those two people that they each thought the world of each other still -- my hands are too stiff ; and I could n't get anyone else to write because I could n't let out what they 'd told me in confidence .
"So I did a mean , dishonourable thing , Nora May ."
I sent Anne 's letter to Gilbert and Gilbert 's to Anne .
"I asked Emma Matilda to address them , and Emma Matilda did it and asked no questions ."
I brought her up that way .
Then I settled down to wait .
In less than a month Gilbert 's mother had a letter from him saying that he was coming home to settle down and marry Anne .
He arrived home yesterday and last night Anne came to Springdale on her way home from St. Mary 's .
They came to see me this morning and said things to me I ai n't going to repeat because they would sound fearful vain .
They were so happy that they made me feel as if it was a good thing to have lived eighty years in a world where folks could be so happy .
They said their new joy was my birthday gift to them .
The wedding is to be in September and I 'm going to Montrose in August to help Anne with her quilts .
"I do n't think anything will happen to prevent this time -- no quarrelling , anyhow ."
Those two young creatures have learned their lesson .
"You 'd better take it to heart too , Nora May ."
It 's less trouble to learn it at second hand .
"Do n't you ever quarrel with your real beau -- it do n't matter about the sham ones , of course ."
"Do n't take offence at trifles or listen to what other people tell you about him -- outsiders , that is , that want to make mischief ."
What you think about him is of more importance than what they do .
"To be sure , you 're too young yet to be thinking of such things at all ."
But just mind what old Aunt Susanna told you when your time comes .
Bertie 's New Year He stood on the sagging doorstep and looked out on the snowy world .
"His hands were clasped behind him , and his thin face wore a thoughtful , puzzled look ."
"The door behind him opened jerkingly , and a scowling woman came out with a pan of dishwater in her hand ."
"`` No , it was Laddie , '' said Ernest , refusing to take any credit at all ."
"We hurried home and arrived at Uncle Richard 's about ten , just as they were going to bed ."
"When Uncle Richard heard what had happened , he turned very pale , and murmured , `` Thank God ! ''"
"Aunt Kate got me out of my wet clothes as quickly as possible , put me away to bed in hot blankets and dosed me with ginger tea ."
I slept like a top and felt none the worse for my experience the next morning .
At the breakfast table Uncle Richard scarcely spoke .
"But , just as we finished , he said abruptly to Ernest , `` I 'm not going to sell Laddie ."
"You and the dog saved Ned 's life between you , and no dog who helped do that is ever going to be sold by me ."
Henceforth he belongs to you .
I give him to you for your very own . ''
"`` Oh , Mr. Lawson ! ''"
"said Ernest , with shining eyes ."
I never saw a boy look so happy .
"As for Laddie , who was sitting beside him with his shaggy head on Ernest 's knee , I really believe the dog understood , too ."
The look in his eyes was almost human .
Uncle Richard leaned over and patted him .
`` Good dog ! ''
he said .
`` Good dog ! ''
"At Five O'Clock in the Morning Fate , in the guise of Mrs. Emory dropping a milk-can on the platform under his open window , awakened Murray that morning ."
"Had not Mrs. Emory dropped that can , he would have slumbered peacefully until his usual hour for rising -- a late one , be it admitted , for of all the boarders at Sweetbriar Cottage Murray was the most irregular in his habits ."
"`` When a young man , '' Mrs. Emory was wont to remark sagely and a trifle severely , `` prowls about that pond half of the night , a-chasing of things what he calls ` moonlight effecks , ' it ai n't to be wondered at that he 's sleepy in the morning ."
"And it ai n't the convenientest thing , nuther and noways , to keep the breakfast table set till the farm folks are thinking of dinner ."
"But them artist men are not like other people , say what you will , and allowance has to be made for them ."
And I must say that I likes him real well and approves of him every other way . ''
"If Murray had slept late that morning -- well , he shudders yet over that `` if . ''"
"But aforesaid Fate saw to it that he woke when the hour of destiny and the milk-can struck , and having awakened he found he could not go to sleep again ."
It suddenly occurred to him that he had never seen a sunrise on the pond .
Doubtless it would be very lovely down there in those dewy meadows at such a primitive hour ; he decided to get up and see what the world looked like in the young daylight .
He scowled at a letter lying on his dressing table and thrust it into his pocket that it might be out of sight .
He had written it the night before and the writing of it was going to cost him several things -- a prospective million among others .
So it is hardly to be wondered at if the sight of it did not reconcile him to the joys of early rising .
"As for washing dishes , Mr. Harrison never made any pretence of doing it unless a rainy Sunday came ."
"Then he went to work and washed them all at once in the rainwater hogshead , and left them to drain dry ."
"Again , Mr. Harrison was `` close . ''"
When he was asked to subscribe to the Rev. Mr. Allan 's salary he said he 'd wait and see how many dollars ' worth of good he got out of his preaching first ... he did n't believe in buying a pig in a poke .
"And when Mrs. Lynde went to ask for a contribution to missions ... and incidentally to see the inside of the house ... he told her there were more heathens among the old woman gossips in Avonlea than anywhere else he knew of , and he 'd cheerfully contribute to a mission for Christianizing them if she 'd undertake it ."
"Mrs. Rachel got herself away and said it was a mercy poor Mrs. Robert Bell was safe in her grave , for it would have broken her heart to see the state of her house in which she used to take so much pride ."
"`` Why , she scrubbed the kitchen floor every second day , '' Mrs. Lynde told Marilla Cuthbert indignantly , `` and if you could see it now !"
I had to hold up my skirts as I walked across it . ''
"Finally , Mr. Harrison kept a parrot called Ginger ."
Nobody in Avonlea had ever kept a parrot before ; consequently that proceeding was considered barely respectable .
And such a parrot !
"If you took John Henry Carter 's word for it , never was such an unholy bird ."
It swore terribly .
Mrs. Carter would have taken John Henry away at once if she had been sure she could get another place for him .
"Besides , Ginger had bitten a piece right out of the back of John Henry 's neck one day when he had stooped down too near the cage ."
Mrs. Carter showed everybody the mark when the luckless John Henry went home on Sundays .
"All these things flashed through Anne 's mind as Mr. Harrison stood , quite speechless with wrath apparently , before her ."
"In his most amiable mood Mr. Harrison could not have been considered a handsome man ; he was short and fat and bald ; and now , with his round face purple with rage and his prominent blue eyes almost sticking out of his head , Anne thought he was really the ugliest person she had ever seen ."
All at once Mr. Harrison found his voice .
"`` I 'm not going to put up with this , '' he spluttered , `` not a day longer , do you hear , miss ."
"Bless my soul , this is the third time , miss ... the third time !"
"Patience has ceased to be a virtue , miss ."
"I warned your aunt the last time not to let it occur again ... and she 's let it ... she 's done it ... what does she mean by it , that is what I want to know ."
"That is what I 'm here about , miss . ''"
`` Will you explain what the trouble is ? ''
"asked Anne , in her most dignified manner ."
She had been practicing it considerably of late to have it in good working order when school began ; but it had no apparent effect on the irate J. A. Harrison .
"`` Trouble , is it ?"
"Bless my soul , trouble enough , I should think ."
"The trouble is , miss , that I found that Jersey cow of your aunt 's in my oats again , not half an hour ago ."
"The third time , mark you ."
I found her in last Tuesday and I found her in yesterday .
That is not the way God works .
"But work He does , Miss Oliver , and in the end His purpose will be fulfilled . ''"
"`` Sound and orthodox -- sound and orthodox , '' muttered Susan approvingly in the kitchen ."
Susan liked to see Miss Oliver sat upon by the minister now and then .
"Susan was very fond of her but she thought Miss Oliver liked saying heretical things to ministers far too well , and deserved an occasional reminder that these matters were quite beyond her province ."
In May Walter wrote home that he had been awarded a D.C. Medal .
"He did not say what for , but the other boys took care that the Glen should know the brave thing Walter had done ."
"`` In any war but this , '' wrote Jerry Meredith , `` it would have meant a V.C. ."
But they ca n't make V.C. 's as common as the brave things done every day here . ''
"`` He should have had the V.C. , '' said Susan , and was very indignant over it ."
"She was not quite sure who was to blame for his not getting it , but if it were General Haig she began for the first time to entertain serious doubts as to his fitness for being Commander-in-Chief ."
Rilla was beside herself with delight .
"It was her dear Walter who had done this thing -- Walter , to whom someone had sent a white feather at Redmond -- it was Walter who had dashed back from the safety of the trench to drag in a wounded comrade who had fallen on No-man 's - land ."
"Oh , she could see his white beautiful face and wonderful eyes as he did it !"
What a thing to be the sister of such a hero !
And he had n't thought it worth while writing about .
His letter was full of other things -- little intimate things that they two had known and loved together in the dear old cloudless days of a century ago .
"`` I 've been thinking of the daffodils in the garden at Ingleside , '' he wrote ."
"`` By the time you get this they will be out , blowing there under that lovely rosy sky ."
"Are they really as bright and golden as ever , Rilla ?"
It seems to me that they must be dyed red with blood -- like our poppies here .
And every whisper of spring will be falling as a violet in Rainbow Valley .
"`` There is a young moon tonight -- a slender , silver , lovely thing hanging over these pits of torment ."
Will you see it tonight over the maple grove ?
"`` I 'm enclosing a little scrap of verse , Rilla ."
I wrote it one evening in my trench dug-out by the light of a bit of candle -- or rather it came to me there -- I did n't feel as if I were writing it -- something seemed to use me as an instrument .
"I 've had that feeling once or twice before , but very rarely and never so strongly as this time ."
That was why I sent it over to the London Spectator .
It printed it and the copy came today .
I hope you 'll like it .
It 's the only poem I 've written since I came overseas . ''
"The poem was a short , poignant little thing ."
Dick bounded to his side and raised him .
His face desperately worked ; his whole body was shaken by contorting spasms .
`` Is the arrow black ? ''
he gasped .
"`` It is black , '' replied Dick , gravely ."
"And then , before he could add one word , a desperate seizure of pain shook the wounded man from head to foot , so that his body leaped in Dick 's supporting arms , and with the extremity of that pang his spirit fled in silence ."
"The young man laid him back gently on the snow and prayed for that unprepared and guilty spirit , and as he prayed the sun came up at a bound , and the robins began chirping in the ivy ."
"When he rose to his feet , he found another man upon his knees but a few steps behind him , and , still with uncovered head , he waited until that prayer also should be over ."
"It took long ; the man , with his head bowed and his face covered with his hands , prayed like one in a great disorder or distress of mind ; and by the bow that lay beside him , Dick judged that he was no other than the archer who had laid Sir Daniel low ."
"At length he , also , rose , and showed the countenance of Ellis Duckworth ."
"`` Richard , '' he said , very gravely , `` I heard you ."
"Ye took the better part and pardoned ; I took the worse , and there lies the clay of mine enemy ."
Pray for me . ''
And he wrung him by the hand .
"`` Sir , '' said Richard , `` I will pray for you , indeed ; though how I may prevail I wot not ."
"But if ye have so long pursued revenge , and find it now of such a sorry flavour , bethink ye , were it not well to pardon others ?"
"Hatch -- he is dead , poor shrew !"
"I would have spared a better ; and for Sir Daniel , here lies his body ."
"But for the priest , if I might anywise prevail , I would have you let him go . ''"
A flash came into the eyes of Ellis Duckworth .
"`` Nay , '' he said , `` the devil is still strong within me ."
But be at rest ; the Black Arrow flieth nevermore -- the fellowship is broken .
"They that still live shall come to their quiet and ripe end , in Heaven 's good time , for me ; and for yourself , go where your better fortune calls you , and think no more of Ellis . ''"
"CHAPTER VIII -- CONCLUSION About nine in the morning , Lord Foxham was leading his ward , once more dressed as befitted her sex , and followed by Alicia Risingham , to the church of Holywood , when Richard Crookback , his brow already heavy with cares , crossed their path and paused ."
`` Is this the maid ? ''
"he asked ; and when Lord Foxham had replied in the affirmative , `` Minion , '' he added , `` hold up your face until I see its favour . ''"
He looked upon her sourly for a little .
"`` Ye are fair , '' he said at last , `` and , as they tell me , dowered ."
"How if I offered you a brave marriage , as became your face and parentage ? ''"
"`` My lord duke , '' replied Joanna , `` may it please your grace , I had rather wed with Sir Richard . ''"
`` How so ? ''
"he asked , harshly ."
I met another clever man a few evenings ago .
A lot of us went for a sail on the harbour .
Mrs. Braddon 's house party came too .
We had three big white boats that skimmed down the moonlit channel like great white sea birds .
"There was another boat far across the harbour , and the people in it were singing ."
"The music drifted over the water to us , so sad and sweet and beguiling that I could have cried for very pleasure ."
One of Mrs. Braddon 's guests said to me : `` That is the soul of music with all its sense and earthliness refined away . ''
I had n't thought about him before -- I had n't even caught his name in the general introduction .
"He was a tall , slight man , with a worn , sensitive face and iron-grey hair -- a quiet man who had n't laughed or talked ."
"But he began to talk to me then , and I forgot all about the others ."
I never had listened to anybody in the least like him .
"He talked of books and music , of art and travel ."
"He had been all over the world , and had seen everything everybody else had seen and everything they had n't too , I think ."
"I seemed to be looking into an enchanted mirror where all my own dreams and ideals were reflected back to me , but made , oh , so much more beautiful !"
On my way home after the Braddon people had left us somebody asked me how I liked Paul Moore !
"The man I had been talking with was Paul Moore , the great novelist !"
I was almost glad I had n't known it while he was talking to me -- I should have been too awed and reverential to have really enjoyed his conversation .
"As it was , I had contradicted him twice , and he had laughed and liked it ."
"But his books will always have a new meaning to me henceforth , through the insight he himself has given me ."
It is such meetings as these that give life its sparkle for me .
But much of its abiding sweetness comes from my friendship with Margaret Raleigh .
You will be weary of my rhapsodies over her .
"But she is such a rare and wonderful woman ; much older then I am , but so young in heart and soul and freshness of feeling !"
"She is to me mother and sister and wise , clear-sighted friend ."
To her I go with all my perplexities and hopes and triumphs .
She has sympathy and understanding for my every mood .
I love life so much for giving me such a friendship !
This morning I wakened at dawn and stole away to the shore before anyone else was up .
I had a delightful run-away .
"The long , low-lying meadows between `` The Evergreens '' and the shore were dewy and fresh in that first light , that was as fine and purely tinted as the heart of one of my white roses ."
"On the beach the water was purring in little blue ripples , and , oh , the sunrise out there beyond the harbour !"
All the eastern Heaven was abloom with it .
"Any day , any hour , might bring John Lincoln to Plainfield ."
What should she do ?
Hide from him ?
Refuse to see him ?
But he would find out the truth just the same ; she would lose his friendships and respect just as surely .
"Sidney trod the way of the transgressor , and found that its thorns pierced to bone and marrow ."
Everything had come to an end -- nothing was left to her !
In the untried recklessness of twenty untempered years she wished she could die before John Lincoln came to Plainfield .
The eyes of youth could not see how she could possibly live afterward .
* * * * * Some days later a young man stepped from the C.P.R. train at Plainfield station and found his way to the one small hotel the place boasted .
After getting his supper he asked the proprietor if he could direct him to `` The Evergreens . ''
Caleb Williams looked at his guest in bewilderment .
"`` Never heerd o ' such a place , '' he said ."
"`` It is the name of Mr. Conway 's estate -- Mr. James Conway , '' explained John Lincoln ."
"`` Oh , Jim Conway 's place ! ''"
said Caleb .
`` Did n't know that was what he called it .
Sartin I kin tell you whar ' to find it .
You see that road out thar ' ?
"Well , just follow it straight along for a mile and a half till you come to a blacksmith 's forge ."
Jim Conway 's house is just this side of it on the right -- back from the road a smart piece and no other handy .
You ca n't mistake it . ''
"John Lincoln did not expect to mistake it , once he found it ; he knew by heart what it appeared like from Sidney 's description : an old stately mansion of mellowed brick , covered with ivy and set back from the highway amid fine ancestral trees , with a pine-grove behind it , a river to the left , and a harbour beyond ."
"He strode along the road in the warm , ruddy sunshine of early evening ."
It was not a bad-looking road at all ; the farmsteads sprinkled along it were for the most part snug and wholesome enough ; yet somehow it was different from what he had expected it to be .
And there was no harbour or glimpse of distant sea visible .
Had the hotel-keeper made a mistake ?
Perhaps he had meant some other James Conway .
Presently he found himself before the blacksmith 's forge .
"Beside it was a rickety , unpainted gate opening into a snake-fenced lane feathered here and there with scrubby little spruces ."
"It ran down a bare hill , crossed a little ravine full of young white-stemmed birches , and up another bare hill to an equally bare crest where a farmhouse was perched -- a farmhouse painted a stark , staring yellow and the ugliest thing in farmhouses that John Lincoln had ever seen , even among the log shacks of the west ."
"He knew now that he had been misdirected , but as there seemed to be nobody about the forge he concluded that he had better go to the yellow house and inquire within ."
Stephen went off to the States and went into business with his uncle and married a Yankee .
"He 's never been home since , though his mother has been up to see him once or twice ."
His wife died two years ago and he 's sending the boy home to his mother for a spell .
He 's ten years old and I do n't know if he 'll be a very desirable pupil .
You can never tell about those Yankees . ''
Mrs Lynde looked upon all people who had the misfortune to be born or brought up elsewhere than in Prince Edward Island with a decided can-any-good-thing-come-out-of-Nazareth air .
"They MIGHT be good people , of course ; but you were on the safe side in doubting it ."
She had a special prejudice against `` Yankees . ''
Her husband had been cheated out of ten dollars by an employer for whom he had once worked in Boston and neither angels nor principalities nor powers could have convinced Mrs. Rachel that the whole United States was not responsible for it .
"`` Avonlea school wo n't be the worse for a little new blood , '' said Marilla drily , `` and if this boy is anything like his father he 'll be all right ."
"Steve Irving was the nicest boy that was ever raised in these parts , though some people did call him proud ."
I should think Mrs. Irving would be very glad to have the child .
She has been very lonesome since her husband died . ''
"`` Oh , the boy may be well enough , but he 'll be different from Avonlea children , '' said Mrs. Rachel , as if that clinched the matter ."
"Mrs. Rachel 's opinions concerning any person , place , or thing , were always warranted to wear ."
"`` What 's this I hear about your going to start up a Village Improvement Society , Anne ? ''"
"`` I was just talking it over with some of the girls and boys at the last Debating Club , '' said Anne , flushing ."
`` They thought it would be rather nice ... and so do Mr. and Mrs. Allan .
Lots of villages have them now . ''
"`` Well , you 'll get into no end of hot water if you do ."
"Better leave it alone , Anne , that 's what ."
People do n't like being improved . ''
"`` Oh , we are not going to try to improve the PEOPLE ."
It is Avonlea itself .
There are lots of things which might be done to make it prettier .
"For instance , if we could coax Mr. Levi Boulter to pull down that dreadful old house on his upper farm would n't that be an improvement ? ''"
"`` It certainly would , '' admitted Mrs. Rachel ."
`` That old ruin has been an eyesore to the settlement for years .
"But if you Improvers can coax Levi Boulter to do anything for the public that he is n't to be paid for doing , may I be there to see and hear the process , that 's what ."
"I do n't want to discourage you , Anne , for there may be something in your idea , though I suppose you did get it out of some rubbishy Yankee magazine ; but you 'll have your hands full with your school and I advise you as a friend not to bother with your improvements , that 's what ."
"But there , I know you 'll go ahead with it if you 've set your mind on it ."
You were always one to carry a thing through somehow . ''
"Ask my man Tom , if ye misdoubt me ."
"Seven pieces of good Gascon wine , a ship that was mine own , and was my father 's before me , a Blessed Mary of plane-tree wood and parcel-gilt , and thirteen pounds in gold and silver ."
Hey !
what say ye ?
"A man that fought the French , too ; for I have fought the French ; I have cut more French throats upon the high seas than ever a man that sails out of Dartmouth ."
"Come , a penny piece . ''"
"Neither Dick nor Lawless durst answer him a word , lest he should recognise their voices ; and they stood there as helpless as a ship ashore , not knowing where to turn nor what to hope ."
"`` Are ye dumb , boy ? ''"
inquired the skipper .
"`` Mates , '' he added , with a hiccup , `` they be dumb ."
"I like not this manner of discourtesy ; for an a man be dumb , so be as he 's courteous , he will still speak when he was spoken to , methinks . ''"
"By this time the sailor , Tom , who was a man of great personal strength , seemed to have conceived some suspicion of these two speechless figures ; and being soberer than his captain , stepped suddenly before him , took Lawless roughly by the shoulder , and asked him , with an oath , what ailed him that he held his tongue ."
"To this the outlaw , thinking all was over , made answer by a wrestling feint that stretched the sailor on the sand , and , calling upon Dick to follow him , took to his heels among the lumber ."
The affair passed in a second .
"Before Dick could run at all , Arblaster had him in his arms ; Tom , crawling on his face , had caught him by one foot , and the third man had a drawn cutlass brandishing above his head ."
"It was not so much the danger , it was not so much the annoyance , that now bowed down the spirits of young Shelton ; it was the profound humiliation to have escaped Sir Daniel , convinced Lord Risingham , and now fall helpless in the hands of this old , drunken sailor ; and not merely helpless , but , as his conscience loudly told him when it was too late , actually guilty -- actually the bankrupt debtor of the man whose ship he had stolen and lost ."
"`` Bring me him back into the alehouse , till I see his face , '' said Arblaster ."
"`` Nay , nay , '' returned Tom ; `` but let us first unload his wallet , lest the other lads cry share . ''"
"But though he was searched from head to foot , not a penny was found upon him ; nothing but Lord Foxham 's signet , which they plucked savagely from his finger ."
"`` Turn me him to the moon , '' said the skipper ; and taking Dick by the chin , he cruelly jerked his head into the air ."
`` Blessed Virgin ! ''
"he cried , `` it is the pirate ! ''"
`` Hey ! ''
cried Tom .
"`` By the Virgin of Bordeaux , it is the man himself ! ''"
repeated Arblaster .
"`` What , sea-thief , do I hold you ? ''"
he cried .
`` Where is my ship ?
Where is my wine ?
Hey !
have I you in my hands ?
`` The innocent should surely come before the guilty . ''
"`` Why , David , '' said he , `` the innocent have aye a chance to get assoiled in court ; but for the lad that shot the bullet , I think the best place for him will be the heather ."
"Them that havenae dipped their hands in any little difficulty , should be very mindful of the case of them that have ."
And that is the good Christianity .
"For if it was the other way round about , and the lad whom I couldnae just clearly see had been in our shoes , and we in his -LRB- as might very well have been -RRB- , I think we would be a good deal obliged to him oursel 's if he would draw the soldiers . ''"
"When it came to this , I gave Alan up ."
"But he looked so innocent all the time , and was in such clear good faith in what he said , and so ready to sacrifice himself for what he deemed his duty , that my mouth was closed ."
Mr. Henderland 's words came back to me : that we ourselves might take a lesson by these wild Highlanders .
"Well , here I had taken mine ."
"Alan 's morals were all tail-first ; but he was ready to give his life for them , such as they were ."
"`` Alan , '' said I , `` I 'll not say it 's the good Christianity as I understand it , but it 's good enough ."
And here I offer ye my hand for the second time . ''
"Whereupon he gave me both of his , saying surely I had cast a spell upon him , for he could forgive me anything ."
"Then he grew very grave , and said we had not much time to throw away , but must both flee that country : he , because he was a deserter , and the whole of Appin would now be searched like a chamber , and every one obliged to give a good account of himself ; and I , because I was certainly involved in the murder ."
`` O ! ''
"says I , willing to give him a little lesson , `` I have no fear of the justice of my country . ''"
`` As if this was your country ! ''
said he .
"`` Or as if ye would be tried here , in a country of Stewarts ! ''"
"`` It 's all Scotland , '' said I. `` Man , I whiles wonder at ye , '' said Alan ."
`` This is a Campbell that 's been killed .
"Well , it 'll be tried in Inverara , the Campbells ' head place ; with fifteen Campbells in the jury-box and the biggest Campbell of all -LRB- and that 's the Duke -RRB- sitting cocking on the bench ."
"Justice , David ?"
"The same justice , by all the world , as Glenure found awhile ago at the roadside . ''"
"This frightened me a little , I confess , and would have frightened me more if I had known how nearly exact were Alan 's predictions ; indeed it was but in one point that he exaggerated , there being but eleven Campbells on the jury ; though as the other four were equally in the Duke 's dependence , it mattered less than might appear ."
"Still , I cried out that he was unjust to the Duke of Argyle , who -LRB- for all he was a Whig -RRB- was yet a wise and honest nobleman ."
`` Hoot ! ''
"said Alan , `` the man 's a Whig , nae doubt ; but I would never deny he was a good chieftain to his clan ."
"And what would the clan think if there was a Campbell shot , and naebody hanged , and their own chief the Justice General ?"
"But I have often observed , '' says Alan , `` that you Low-country bodies have no clear idea of what 's right and wrong . ''"
"At this I did at last laugh out aloud , when to my surprise , Alan joined in , and laughed as merrily as myself ."
"`` Na , na , '' said he , `` we 're in the Hielands , David ; and when I tell ye to run , take my word and run ."
"`` Then I shall send him right home , '' said Daisy , with decision ."
"`` People do n't do so at parties , it is n't proper . ''"
`` I shall never ask him any more . ''
`` That would do .
"He 'd be sorry not to come to the dinner-ball , would n't he ? ''"
`` I guess he would !
"we 'll have the splendidest things ever seen , wo n't we ?"
"Real soup with a ladle and a tureem -LSB- she meant tureen -RSB- and a little bird for turkey , and gravy , and all kinds of nice vegytubbles . ''"
"Daisy never could say vegetables properly , and had given up trying ."
"`` It is ` most three , and we ought to dress , '' said Nan , who had arranged a fine costume for the occasion , and was anxious to wear it ."
"`` I am the mother , so I sha n't dress up much , '' said Daisy , putting on a night-cap ornamented with a red bow , one of her aunt 's long skirts , and a shawl ; a pair of spectacles and large pocket handkerchief completed her toilette , making a plump , rosy little matron of her ."
"Nan had a wreath of artificial flowers , a pair of old pink slippers , a yellow scarf , a green muslin skirt , and a fan made of feathers from the duster ; also , as a last touch of elegance , a smelling-bottle without any smell in it ."
"`` I am the daughter , so I rig up a good deal , and I must sing and dance , and talk more than you do ."
"The mothers only get the tea and be proper , you know . ''"
"A sudden very loud knock caused Miss Smith to fly into a chair , and fan herself violently , while her mamma sat bolt upright on the sofa , and tried to look quite calm and `` proper . ''"
"Little Bess , who was on a visit , acted the part of maid , and opened the door , saying with a smile , `` Wart in , gemplemun ; it 's all weady . ''"
"In honor of the occasion , the boys wore high paper collars , tall black hats , and gloves of every color and material , for they were an afterthought , and not a boy among them had a perfect pair ."
"`` Good day , mum , '' said Demi , in a deep voice , which was so hard to keep up that his remarks had to be extremely brief ."
"Every one shook hands and then sat down , looking so funny , yet so sober , that the gentlemen forgot their manners , and rolled in their chairs with laughter ."
"`` Oh , do n't ! ''"
"cried Mrs. Smith , much distressed ."
"`` You ca n't ever come again if you act so , '' added Miss Smith , rapping Mr. Bangs with her bottle because he laughed loudest ."
"`` I ca n't help it , you look so like fury , '' gasped Mr. Bangs , with most uncourteous candor ."
"`` So do you , but I should n't be so rude as to say so ."
"He sha n't come to the dinner-ball , shall he , Daisy ? ''"
"cried Nan , indignantly ."
`` I think we had better dance now .
"Did you bring your fiddle , sir ? ''"
"asked Mrs. Smith , trying to preserve her polite composure ."
"`` It is outside the door , '' and Nat went to get it ."
"`` Better have tea first , '' proposed the unabashed Tommy , winking openly at Demi to remind him that the sooner the refreshments were secured , the sooner they could escape ."
"`` No , we never have supper first ; and if you do n't dance well you wo n't have any supper at all , not one bit , sir , '' said Mrs. Smith , so sternly that her wild guests saw she was not to be trifled with , and grew overwhelmingly civil all at once ."
Jem and Walter were yours but Shirley is mine .
And I can not bear to think of him flying -- his machine crashing down -- the life crushed out of his body -- the dear little body I nursed and cuddled when he was a wee baby . ''
"`` Susan -- do n't , '' cried Anne ."
"`` Oh , Mrs. Dr. dear , I beg your pardon ."
I ought not to have said anything like that out loud .
I sometimes forget that I resolved to be a heroine .
This -- this has shaken me a little .
But I will not forget myself again .
Only if things do not go as smoothly in the kitchen for a few days I hope you will make due allowance for me .
"At least , '' said poor Susan , forcing a grim smile in a desperate effort to recover lost standing , `` at least flying is a clean job ."
"He will not get so dirty and messed up as he would in the trenches , and that is well , for he has always been a tidy child . ''"
"So Shirley went -- not radiantly , as to a high adventure , like Jem , not in a white flame of sacrifice , like Walter , but in a cool , business-like mood , as of one doing something , rather dirty and disagreeable , that had just got to be done ."
"He kissed Susan for the first time since he was five years old , and said , `` Good-bye , Susan -- mother Susan . ''"
"`` My little brown boy -- my little brown boy , '' said Susan ."
"`` I wonder , '' she thought bitterly , as she looked at the doctor 's sorrowful face , `` if you remember how you spanked him once when he was a baby ."
I am thankful I have nothing like that on my conscience now . ''
The doctor did not remember the old discipline .
But before he put on his hat to go out on his round of calls he stood for a moment in the great silent living-room that had once been full of children 's laughter .
"`` Our last son -- our last son , '' he said aloud ."
"`` A good , sturdy , sensible lad , too ."
Always reminded me of my father .
I suppose I ought to be proud that he wanted to go -- I was proud when Jem went -- even when Walter went -- but ` our house is left us desolate . ' ''
"`` I have been thinking , doctor , '' old Sandy of the Upper Glen said to him that afternoon , `` that your house will be seeming very big the day . ''"
Highland Sandy 's quaint phrase struck the doctor as perfectly expressive .
Ingleside did seem very big and empty that night .
"Yet Shirley had been away all winter except for week-ends , and had always been a quiet fellow even when home ."
Was it because he had been the only one left that his going seemed to leave such a huge blank -- that every room seemed vacant and deserted -- that the very trees on the lawn seemed to be trying to comfort each other with caresses of freshly-budding boughs for the loss of the last of the little lads who had romped under them in childhood ?
Susan worked very hard all day and late into the night .
"When she had wound the kitchen clock and put Dr. Jekyll out , none too gently , she stood for a little while on the doorstep , looking down the Glen , which lay tranced in faint , silvery light from a sinking young moon ."
But Susan did not see the familiar hills and harbour .
She was looking at the aviation camp in Kingsport where Shirley was that night .
"`` He called me ` Mother Susan , ' '' she was thinking ."
"As for me , I had n't any real objection to marrying him , after all , for if he was short of romance he was good-natured and has a fat bank account ; but I hated to be driven into it that way ."
"`` You 'd better take him , Melissa , '' I said entreatingly ."
`` I 've had one husband and that is enough . ''
"`` More than enough for me , thank you , '' said Melissa sarcastically ."
"`` Isaac is a fine man and has a lovely house ; and you are n't sure the Kingsbridge man really means anything , '' I went on ."
"`` I would rather , '' said Melissa , with the same awful calmness , `` jump down from this roof and break my neck , or be devoured piecemeal by that fiend down there than marry Isaac Appleby . ''"
It did n't seem worth while to say anything more after that .
We sat there in stony silence and the time dragged by .
"I was hot , hungry , thirsty , cross ; and besides , I felt that I was in a ridiculous position , which was worse than all the rest ."
We could see Isaac sitting in the shade of one of his apple trees in the front orchard comfortably reading a newspaper .
I think if he had n't aggravated me by doing that I 'd have given in sooner .
"But as it was , I was determined to be as stubborn as everybody else ."
We were four obstinate creatures -- Isaac and Melissa and Julius Caesar and I .
At four o'clock Isaac got up and went into the house ; in a few minutes he came out again with a basket in one hand and a ball of cord in the other .
"`` I do n't intend to starve you , of course , ladies , '' he said politely , `` I will throw this ball up to you and you can then draw up the basket . ''"
"I caught the ball , for Melissa never turned her head ."
"I would have preferred to be scornful , too , and reject the food altogether ; but I was so dreadfully thirsty that I put my pride in my pocket and hauled the basket up ."
"Besides , I thought it might enable us to hold out until some loophole of escape presented itself ."
Isaac went back into the house and I unpacked the basket .
"There was a bottle of milk , some bread and butter , and a pie ."
"Melissa would n't take a morsel of the food , but she was so thirsty she had to take a drink of milk ."
"She tried to lift her veil -- and something caught ; Melissa gave it a savage twitch , and off came veil and hat -- and all her front hair !"
You never saw such a sight .
"I 'd always suspected Melissa wore a false front , but I 'd never had any proof before ."
"Melissa pinned on her hair again and put on her hat and drank the milk , all without a word ; but she was purple ."
I felt sorry for her .
And I felt sorry for Isaac when I tried to eat that bread .
It was sour and dreadful .
"As for the pie , it was hopeless ."
"I tasted it , and then threw it down to Julius Caesar ."
"Julius Caesar , not being over particular , ate it up ."
"I thought perhaps it would kill him , for anything might come of eating such a concoction ."
"Presently Wendy took the hat , because John said it struck against his knee as he flew ; and this , as we shall see , led to mischief , for Tinker Bell hated to be under an obligation to Wendy ."
"In the black topper the light was completely hidden , and they flew on in silence ."
"It was the stillest silence they had ever known , broken once by a distant lapping , which Peter explained was the wild beasts drinking at the ford , and again by a rasping sound that might have been the branches of trees rubbing together , but he said it was the redskins sharpening their knives ."
Even these noises ceased .
To Michael the loneliness was dreadful .
` If only something would make a sound ! '
he cried .
"As if in answer to his request , the air was rent by the most tremendous crash he had ever heard ."
The pirates had fired Long Tom at them .
"The roar of it echoed through the mountains , and the echoes seemed to cry savagely , ` Where are they , where are they , where are they ? '"
Thus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference between an island of make-believe and the same island come true .
"When at last the heavens were steady again , John and Michael found themselves alone in the darkness ."
"John was treading the air mechanically , and Michael without knowing how to float was floating ."
` Are you shot ? '
John whispered tremulously . '
"I have n't tried yet , ' Michael whispered back ."
We know now that no one had been hit .
"Peter , however , had been carried by the wind of the shot far out to sea , while Wendy was blown upwards with no companion but Tinker Bell ."
It would have been well for Wendy if at that moment she had dropped the hat .
"I do n't know whether the idea came suddenly to Tink , or whether she had planned it on the way , but she at once popped out of the hat and began to lure Wendy to her destruction ."
"Tink was not all bad : or , rather , she was all bad just now , but , on the other hand , sometimes she was all good ."
"Fairies have to be one thing or the other , because being so small they unfortunately have room for one feeling only at a time ."
"They are , however , allowed to change , only it must be a complete change ."
At present she was full of jealousy of Wendy .
"What she said in her lovely tinkle Wendy could not of course understand , and I believe some of it was bad words , but it sounded kind , and she flew back and forward , plainly meaning ` Follow me , and all will be well . '"
What else could poor Wendy do ?
"She called to Peter and John and Michael , and got only mocking echoes in reply ."
She did not yet know that Tink hated her with the fierce hatred of a very woman .
"And so , bewildered , and now staggering in her flight , she followed Tink to her doom ."
"CHAPTER V THE ISLAND COME TRUE Feeling that Peter was on his way back , the Neverland had again woke into life ."
"We ought to use the pluperfect and say wakened , but woke is better and was always used by Peter ."
In his absence things are usually quiet on the island .
"cried Alan , `` if I make a boat , I 'll make a body to take it back again !"
"So deave me with no more of your nonsense , but walk -LRB- for that 's what you 've got to do -RRB- -- and let Alan think for ye . ''"
"All night , then , we walked through the north side of the Carse under the high line of the Ochil mountains ; and by Alloa and Clackmannan and Culross , all of which we avoided : and about ten in the morning , mighty hungry and tired , came to the little clachan of Limekilns ."
"This is a place that sits near in by the water-side , and looks across the Hope to the town of the Queensferry ."
"Smoke went up from both of these , and from other villages and farms upon all hands ."
"The fields were being reaped ; two ships lay anchored , and boats were coming and going on the Hope ."
"It was altogether a right pleasant sight to me ; and I could not take my fill of gazing at these comfortable , green , cultivated hills and the busy people both of the field and sea ."
"For all that , there was Mr. Rankeillor 's house on the south shore , where I had no doubt wealth awaited me ; and here was I upon the north , clad in poor enough attire of an outlandish fashion , with three silver shillings left to me of all my fortune , a price set upon my head , and an outlawed man for my sole company ."
"`` O , Alan ! ''"
"said I , `` to think of it !"
"Over there , there 's all that heart could want waiting me ; and the birds go over , and the boats go over -- all that please can go , but just me only !"
"O , man , but it 's a heart-break ! ''"
"In Limekilns we entered a small change-house , which we only knew to be a public by the wand over the door , and bought some bread and cheese from a good-looking lass that was the servant ."
"This we carried with us in a bundle , meaning to sit and eat it in a bush of wood on the sea-shore , that we saw some third part of a mile in front ."
"As we went , I kept looking across the water and sighing to myself ; and though I took no heed of it , Alan had fallen into a muse ."
At last he stopped in the way .
`` Did ye take heed of the lass we bought this of ? ''
"says he , tapping on the bread and cheese ."
"`` To be sure , '' said I , `` and a bonny lass she was . ''"
`` Ye thought that ? ''
cries he .
"`` Man , David , that 's good news . ''"
"`` In the name of all that 's wonderful , why so ? ''"
says I. `` What good can that do ? ''
"`` Well , '' said Alan , with one of his droll looks , `` I was rather in hopes it would maybe get us that boat . ''"
"`` If it were the other way about , it would be liker it , '' said I. `` That 's all that you ken , ye see , '' said Alan ."
"`` I do n't want the lass to fall in love with ye , I want her to be sorry for ye , David ; to which end there is no manner of need that she should take you for a beauty ."
Let me see '' -LRB- looking me curiously over -RRB- .
"`` I wish ye were a wee thing paler ; but apart from that ye 'll do fine for my purpose -- ye have a fine , hang-dog , rag-and-tatter , clappermaclaw kind of a look to ye , as if ye had stolen the coat from a potato-bogle ."
"Come ; right about , and back to the change-house for that boat of ours . ''"
"I followed him , laughing ."
"`` David Balfour , '' said he , `` ye 're a very funny gentleman by your way of it , and this is a very funny employ for ye , no doubt ."
"`` I do n't reckon there 'd be much amusement in it ... more worry and bother than anything else , I should say ."
It would n't be so risky if they were even as old as you were when I took you .
I would n't mind Dora so much ... she seems good and quiet .
But that Davy is a limb . ''
Anne was fond of children and her heart yearned over the Keith twins .
The remembrance of her own neglected childhood was very vivid with her still .
"She knew that Marilla 's only vulnerable point was her stern devotion to what she believed to be her duty , and Anne skillfully marshalled her arguments along this line ."
"`` If Davy is naughty it 's all the more reason why he should have good training , is n't it , Marilla ?"
"If we do n't take them we do n't know who will , nor what kind of influences may surround them ."
"Suppose Mrs. Keith 's next door neighbors , the Sprotts , were to take them ."
Mrs. Lynde says Henry Sprott is the most profane man that ever lived and you ca n't believe a word his children say .
Would n't it be dreadful to have the twins learn anything like that ?
Or suppose they went to the Wiggins ' .
Mrs. Lynde says that Mr. Wiggins sells everything off the place that can be sold and brings his family up on skim milk .
"You would n't like your relations to be starved , even if they were only third cousins , would you ?"
"It seems to me , Marilla , that it is our duty to take them . ''"
"`` I suppose it is , '' assented Marilla gloomily ."
`` I daresay I 'll tell Mary I 'll take them .
"You need n't look so delighted , Anne ."
It will mean a good deal of extra work for you .
"I ca n't sew a stitch on account of my eyes , so you 'll have to see to the making and mending of their clothes ."
And you do n't like sewing . ''
"`` I hate it , '' said Anne calmly , `` but if you are willing to take those children from a sense of duty surely I can do their sewing from a sense of duty ."
It does people good to have to do things they do n't like ... in moderation . ''
"VIII Marilla Adopts Twins Mrs. Rachel Lynde was sitting at her kitchen window , knitting a quilt , just as she had been sitting one evening several years previously when Matthew Cuthbert had driven down over the hill with what Mrs. Rachel called `` his imported orphan . ''"
"But that had been in springtime ; and this was late autumn , and all the woods were leafless and the fields sere and brown ."
The sun was just setting with a great deal of purple and golden pomp behind the dark woods west of Avonlea when a buggy drawn by a comfortable brown nag came down the hill .
Mrs. Rachel peered at it eagerly .
"`` There 's Marilla getting home from the funeral , '' she said to her husband , who was lying on the kitchen lounge ."
"Thomas Lynde lay more on the lounge nowadays than he had been used to do , but Mrs. Rachel , who was so sharp at noticing anything beyond her own household , had not as yet noticed this ."
"`` And she 's got the twins with her , ... yes , there 's Davy leaning over the dashboard grabbing at the pony 's tail and Marilla jerking him back ."
Dora 's sitting up on the seat as prim as you please .
"I never shall forget it , and I 'll do anything for you ."
Yes !
I 'll write and ask Mrs. Piper to lend us her ermine cloak for the king .
See if I do n't ! ''
"Shrieks of delight hailed this noble offer , for no one had dared to borrow the much-coveted mantle , but all agreed that the old lady would not refuse Jill ."
"It was astonishing how smoothly everything went after this , for each was eager to help , admire , and suggest , in the friendliest way ; and when all were dressed , the boys found a party of very gay ladies waiting for them round the couch , where lay the brightest little Princess ever seen ."
"`` Oh , Jack , I 'm to act !"
Was n't it dear of the girls to choose me ?
Do n't they look lovely ?
Are n't you glad ? ''
"cried Jill , as the lads stared and the lasses blushed and smiled , well pleased at the frank admiration the boyish faces showed ."
`` I guess I am !
"You are a set of trumps , and we 'll give you a first-class spread after the play to pay for it ."
"Wo n't we , fellows ? ''"
"answered Jack , much gratified , and feeling that now he could act his own part capitally ."
`` We will .
"It was a handsome thing to do , and we think well of you for it ."
"Hey , Gus ? ''"
"and Frank nodded approvingly at all , though he looked only at Annette ."
"`` As king of this crowd , I call it to order , '' said Gus , retiring to the throne , where Juliet sat laughing in her red table-cloth ."
"`` We 'll have ` The Fair One with Golden Locks ' next time ; I promise you that , '' whispered Ed to Mabel , whose shining hair streamed over her blue dress like a mantle of gold-colored silk ."
"`` Girls are pretty nice things , are n't they ?"
Kind of 'em to take Jill in .
"Do n't Molly look fine , though ? ''"
and Grif 's black eyes twinkled as he planned to pin her skirts to Merry 's at the first opportunity .
`` Susy looks as gay as a feather-duster .
I like her .
"She never snubs a fellow , '' said Joe , much impressed with the splendor of the court ladies ."
"The boys ' costumes were not yet ready , but they posed well , and all had a merry time , ending with a game of blind-man 's - buff , in which every one caught the right person in the most singular way , and all agreed as they went home in the moonlight that it had been an unusually jolly meeting ."
"So the fairy play woke the sleeping beauty that lies in all of us , and makes us lovely when we rouse it with a kiss of unselfish good-will , for , though the girls did not know it then , they had adorned themselves with pearls more precious than the waxen ones they decked their Princess in ."
Chapter XI .
"`` Down Brakes '' The greatest people have their weak points , and the best-behaved boys now and then yield to temptation and get into trouble , as everybody knows ."
Danger !
"` Are you sure , Wendy ? '"
` Oh yes . '
Mrs. Darling quivered and went to the window .
It was securely fastened .
"She looked out , and the night was peppered with stars ."
"They were crowding round the house , as if curious to see what was to take place there , but she did not notice this , nor that one or two of the smaller ones winked at her ."
"Yet a nameless fear clutched at her heart and made her cry , ` Oh , how I wish that I was n't going to a party to-night ! '"
"Even Michael , already half asleep , knew that she was perturbed , and he asked , ` Can anything harm us , mother , after the night-lights are lit ? '"
"` Nothing , precious , ' she said ; ` they are the eyes a mother leaves behind her to guard her children . '"
"She went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them , and little Michael flung his arms round her ."
"` Mother , ' he cried , ` I 'm glad of you . '"
They were the last words she was to hear from him for a long time .
"-LSB- Illustration : PETER FLEW IN -RSB- No. 27 was only a few yards distant , but there had been a slight fall of snow , and Father and Mother Darling picked their way over it deftly not to soil their shoes ."
"They were already the only persons in the street , and all the stars were watching them ."
"Stars are beautiful , but they may not take an active part in anything , they must just look on for ever ."
It is a punishment put on them for something they did so long ago that no star now knows what it was .
"So the older ones have become glassy-eyed and seldom speak -LRB- winking is the star language -RRB- , but the little ones still wonder ."
"They are not really friendly to Peter , who has a mischievous way of stealing up behind them and trying to blow them out ; but they are so fond of fun that they were on his side to-night , and anxious to get the grown-ups out of the way ."
"So as soon as the door of 27 closed on Mr. and Mrs. Darling there was a commotion in the firmament , and the smallest of all the stars in the Milky Way screamed out : ` Now , Peter ! '"
"CHAPTER III COME AWAY , COME AWAY !"
For a moment after Mr. and Mrs. Darling left the house the night-lights by the beds of the three children continued to burn clearly .
"They were awfully nice little night-lights , and one can not help wishing that they could have kept awake to see Peter ; but Wendy 's light blinked and gave such a yawn that the other two yawned also , and before they could close their mouths all the three went out ."
"There was another light in the room now , a thousand times brighter than the night-lights , and in the time we have taken to say this , it has been in all the drawers in the nursery , looking for Peter 's shadow , rummaged the wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out ."
"It was not really a light ; it made this light by flashing about so quickly , but when it came to rest for a second you saw it was a fairy , no longer than your hand , but still growing ."
"It was a girl called Tinker Bell exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf , cut low and square , through which her figure could be seen to the best advantage ."
She was slightly inclined to embonpoint .
"A moment after the fairy 's entrance the window was blown open by the breathing of the little stars , and Peter dropped in ."
"He had carried Tinker Bell part of the way , and his hand was still messy with the fairy dust ."
"` Tinker Bell , ' he called softly , after making sure that the children were asleep , ` Tink , where are you ? '"
"She was in a jug for the moment , and liking it extremely ; she had never been in a jug before ."
"` Oh , do come out of that jug , and tell me , do you know where they put my shadow ? '"
"Thereupon he fell in a muse , looking in the embers of the fire ; and presently , getting a piece of wood , he fashioned it in a cross , the four ends of which he blackened on the coals ."
Then he looked at me a little shyly .
`` Could ye lend me my button ? ''
says he .
"`` It seems a strange thing to ask a gift again , but I own I am laith to cut another . ''"
"I gave him the button ; whereupon he strung it on a strip of his great-coat which he had used to bind the cross ; and tying in a little sprig of birch and another of fir , he looked upon his work with satisfaction ."
"`` Now , '' said he , `` there is a little clachan '' -LRB- what is called a hamlet in the English -RRB- `` not very far from Corrynakiegh , and it has the name of Koalisnacoan ."
"There there are living many friends of mine whom I could trust with my life , and some that I am no just so sure of ."
"Ye see , David , there will be money set upon our heads ; James himsel ' is to set money on them ; and as for the Campbells , they would never spare siller where there was a Stewart to be hurt ."
"If it was otherwise , I would go down to Koalisnacoan whatever , and trust my life into these people 's hands as lightly as I would trust another with my glove . ''"
`` But being so ? ''
"said I. `` Being so , '' said he , `` I would as lief they didnae see me ."
"There 's bad folk everywhere , and what 's far worse , weak ones ."
"So when it comes dark again , I will steal down into that clachan , and set this that I have been making in the window of a good friend of mine , John Breck Maccoll , a bouman * of Appin 's . ''"
* A bouman is a tenant who takes stock from the landlord and shares with him the increase .
"`` With all my heart , '' says I ; `` and if he finds it , what is he to think ? ''"
"`` Well , '' says Alan , `` I wish he was a man of more penetration , for by my troth I am afraid he will make little enough of it !"
But this is what I have in my mind .
"This cross is something in the nature of the crosstarrie , or fiery cross , which is the signal of gathering in our clans ; yet he will know well enough the clan is not to rise , for there it is standing in his window , and no word with it ."
"So he will say to himsel ' , THE CLAN IS NOT TO RISE , BUT THERE IS SOMETHING ."
"Then he will see my button , and that was Duncan Stewart 's ."
"And then he will say to himsel ' , THE SON OF DUNCAN IS IN THE HEATHER , AND HAS NEED OF ME . ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` it may be ."
"But even supposing so , there is a good deal of heather between here and the Forth . ''"
"`` And that is a very true word , '' says Alan ."
"`` But then John Breck will see the sprig of birch and the sprig of pine ; and he will say to himsel ' -LRB- if he is a man of any penetration at all , which I misdoubt -RRB- , ALAN WILL BE LYING IN A WOOD WHICH IS BOTH OF PINES AND BIRCHES ."
"Then he will think to himsel ' , THAT IS NOT SO VERY RIFE HEREABOUT ; and then he will come and give us a look up in Corrynakiegh ."
"And if he does not , David , the devil may fly away with him , for what I care ; for he will no be worth the salt to his porridge . ''"
"`` Eh , man , '' said I , drolling with him a little , `` you 're very ingenious !"
But would it not be simpler for you to write him a few words in black and white ? ''
"`` And that is an excellent observe , Mr. Balfour of Shaws , '' says Alan , drolling with me ; `` and it would certainly be much simpler for me to write to him , but it would be a sore job for John Breck to read it ."
He would have to go to the school for two-three years ; and it 's possible we might be wearied waiting on him . ''
"And then there was water there , and water 's a thing that dauntons even me ."
"No , no , '' said Alan , `` it 's no you that 's to blame , it 's me . ''"
I asked him why .
"`` Why , '' said he , `` I have proved myself a gomeral this night ."
"For first of all I take a wrong road , and that in my own country of Appin ; so that the day has caught us where we should never have been ; and thanks to that , we lie here in some danger and mair discomfort ."
"And next -LRB- which is the worst of the two , for a man that has been so much among the heather as myself -RRB- I have come wanting a water-bottle , and here we lie for a long summer 's day with naething but neat spirit ."
"Ye may think that a small matter ; but before it comes night , David , ye 'll give me news of it . ''"
"I was anxious to redeem my character , and offered , if he would pour out the brandy , to run down and fill the bottle at the river ."
"`` I wouldnae waste the good spirit either , '' says he ."
"`` It 's been a good friend to you this night ; or in my poor opinion , ye would still be cocking on yon stone ."
"And what 's mair , '' says he , `` ye may have observed -LRB- you that 's a man of so much penetration -RRB- that Alan Breck Stewart was perhaps walking quicker than his ordinar ' . ''"
`` You ! ''
"I cried , `` you were running fit to burst . ''"
`` Was I so ? ''
said he .
"`` Well , then , ye may depend upon it , there was nae time to be lost ."
"And now here is enough said ; gang you to your sleep , lad , and I 'll watch . ''"
"Accordingly , I lay down to sleep ; a little peaty earth had drifted in between the top of the two rocks , and some bracken grew there , to be a bed to me ; the last thing I heard was still the crying of the eagles ."
"I dare say it would be nine in the morning when I was roughly awakened , and found Alan 's hand pressed upon my mouth ."
`` Wheesht ! ''
he whispered .
`` Ye were snoring . ''
"`` Well , '' said I , surprised at his anxious and dark face , `` and why not ? ''"
"He peered over the edge of the rock , and signed to me to do the like ."
"It was now high day , cloudless , and very hot ."
The valley was as clear as in a picture .
"About half a mile up the water was a camp of red-coats ; a big fire blazed in their midst , at which some were cooking ; and near by , on the top of a rock about as high as ours , there stood a sentry , with the sun sparkling on his arms ."
"All the way down along the river-side were posted other sentries ; here near together , there widelier scattered ; some planted like the first , on places of command , some on the ground level and marching and counter-marching , so as to meet half-way ."
"Higher up the glen , where the ground was more open , the chain of posts was continued by horse-soldiers , whom we could see in the distance riding to and fro ."
"Lower down , the infantry continued ; but as the stream was suddenly swelled by the confluence of a considerable burn , they were more widely set , and only watched the fords and stepping-stones ."
"I took but one look at them , and ducked again into my place ."
"It was strange indeed to see this valley , which had lain so solitary in the hour of dawn , bristling with arms and dotted with the red coats and breeches ."
he asked .
`` I thought ye were of the other party . ''
Matcham began to sob .
`` What cheer ! ''
cried Dick .
`` Now the saints behold us !
would ye snivel for a word ? ''
"`` Ye hurt me , '' sobbed Matcham ."
`` Ye hurt me when ye threw me down .
Y ' are a coward to abuse your strength . ''
"`` Nay , that is fool 's talk , '' said Dick , roughly ."
"`` Y ' had no title to my windac , Master John ."
I would ` a ' done right to have well basted you .
"If ye go with me , ye must obey me ; and so , come . ''"
"Matcham had half a thought to stay behind ; but , seeing that Dick continued to scour full-tilt towards the eminence and not so much as looked across his shoulder , he soon thought better of that , and began to run in turn ."
"But the ground was very difficult and steep ; Dick had already a long start , and had , at any rate , the lighter heels , and he had long since come to the summit , crawled forward through the firs , and ensconced himself in a thick tuft of gorse , before Matcham , panting like a deer , rejoined him , and lay down in silence by his side ."
"Below , in the bottom of a considerable valley , the short cut from Tunstall hamlet wound downwards to the ferry ."
"It was well beaten , and the eye followed it easily from point to point ."
Here it was bordered by open glades ; there the forest closed upon it ; every hundred yards it ran beside an ambush .
"Far down the path , the sun shone on seven steel salets , and from time to time , as the trees opened , Selden and his men could be seen riding briskly , still bent upon Sir Daniel 's mission ."
"The wind had somewhat fallen , but still tussled merrily with the trees , and , perhaps , had Appleyard been there , he would have drawn a warning from the troubled conduct of the birds ."
"`` Now , mark , '' Dick whispered ."
`` They be already well advanced into the wood ; their safety lieth rather in continuing forward .
"But see ye where this wide glade runneth down before us , and in the midst of it , these two score trees make like an island ?"
There were their safety .
"An they but come sound as far as that , I will make shift to warn them ."
"But my heart misgiveth me ; they are but seven against so many , and they but carry cross-bows ."
"The long-bow , Jack , will have the uppermost ever . ''"
"Meanwhile , Selden and his men still wound up the path , ignorant of their danger , and momently drew nearer hand ."
"Once , indeed , they paused , drew into a group , and seemed to point and listen ."
"But it was something from far away across the plain that had arrested their attention -- a hollow growl of cannon that came , from time to time , upon the wind , and told of the great battle ."
"It was worth a thought , to be sure ; for if the voice of the big guns were thus become audible in Tunstall Forest , the fight must have rolled ever eastward , and the day , by consequence , gone sore against Sir Daniel and the lords of the dark rose ."
"`` Oh , that is the postmaster 's son , '' said Alan disappointedly ."
`` That puts us further off the scent than ever .
The letter was probably dropped in the box at the office and there will consequently be no way of tracing the writer . ''
"`` Well , I ca n't tell you anything more , '' said Emily ."
`` You 'll have to ask Lynde for the truth . ''
This Alan was determined to do whenever he should meet her .
"He did not go to the house with Emily but wandered about the shore , watching for Lynde and not seeing her ."
"At length he went home , a prey to stormy emotions ."
He realized at last that he loved Lynde Oliver .
He wondered how he could have been so long blind to it .
He knew that he must have loved her ever since he had first seen her .
The discovery amazed but did not shock him .
There was no reason why he should not love her -- should not woo and win her for his wife if she cared for him .
She was good and sweet and true .
Anything of doubt in her antecedents could not touch her .
"Probably the world would look upon Captain Anthony as a somewhat undesirable father-in-law for a minister , but that aspect of the question did not disturb Alan ."
"As for the trouble of the letter , he felt sure he would easily be able to clear it away ."
Probably some malicious busybody had become aware of his frequent calls at Four Winds and chose to interfere in his private affairs thus .
For the first time it occurred to him that there had been a certain lack of cordiality among his people of late .
"If it were really so , doubtless this was the reason ."
At any other time this would have been of moment to him .
But now his thoughts were too wholly taken up with Lynde and the estrangement on her part to attach much importance to anything else .
What she thought mattered incalculably more to Alan than what all the people in Rexton put together thought .
"He had the right , like any other man , to woo the woman of his choice and he would certainly brook no outside interference in the matter ."
After a sleepless night he went back to Four Winds in the morning .
Lynde would not expect him at that time and he would have more chance of finding her .
"The result justified his idea , for he met her by the spring ."
Alan felt shocked at the change in her appearance .
She looked as if years of suffering had passed over her .
"Her lips were pallid , and hollow circles under her eyes made them appear unnaturally large ."
He had last left the girl in the bloom of her youth ; he found her again a woman on whom life had laid its heavy hand .
"A burning flood of colour swept over her face as they met , then receded as quickly , leaving her whiter than before ."
`` Of course you may !
"This proves to me that we have a hold on the boy 's heart , and I would no more send him away now than I would my own Rob . ''"
"Dan heard a soft little sound , as if Mrs. Jo thanked her husband without words , and , in the instant 's silence that followed , two great tears that had slowly gathered in the boy 's eyes brimmed over and rolled down his dusty cheeks ."
"No one saw them , for he brushed them hastily away ; but in that little pause I think Dan 's old distrust for these good people vanished for ever , the soft spot in his heart was touched , and he felt an impetuous desire to prove himself worthy of the love and pity that was so patient and forgiving ."
"He said nothing , he only wished the wish with all his might , resolved to try in his blind boyish way , and sealed his resolution with the tears which neither pain , fatigue , nor loneliness could wring from him ."
`` Come and see his foot .
"I am afraid it is badly hurt , for he has kept on three days through heat and dust , with nothing but water and an old jacket to bind it up with ."
"I tell you , Fritz , that boy is a brave lad , and will make a fine man yet . ''"
"`` I hope so , for your sake , enthusiastic woman , your faith deserves success ."
"Now , I will go and see your little Spartan ."
Where is he ? ''
"`` In my room ; but , dear , you 'll be very kind to him , no matter how gruff he seems ."
I am sure that is the way to conquer him .
"He wo n't bear sternness nor much restraint , but a soft word and infinite patience will lead him as it used to lead me . ''"
`` As if you ever like this little rascal ! ''
"cried Mr. Bhaer , laughing , yet half angry at the idea ."
"`` I was in spirit , though I showed it in a different way ."
"I seem to know by instinct how he feels , to understand what will win and touch him , and to sympathize with his temptations and faults ."
"I am glad I do , for it will help me to help him ; and if I can make a good man of this wild boy , it will be the best work of my life . ''"
"`` God bless the work , and help the worker ! ''"
"Mr. Bhaer spoke now as earnestly as she had done , and both came in together to find Dan 's head down upon his arm , as if he was quite overcome by sleep ."
"But he looked up quickly , and tried to rise as Mr. Bhaer said pleasantly , `` So you like Plumfield better than Page 's farm ."
"Well , let us see if we can get on more comfortably this time than we did before . ''"
"`` Thanky , sir , '' said Dan , trying not to be gruff , and finding it easier than he expected ."
"`` Now , the foot !"
Ach !
this is not well .
We must have Dr. Firth to-morrow .
"Warm water , Jo , and old linen . ''"
"Mr. Bhaer bathed and bound up the wounded foot , while Mrs. Jo prepared the only empty bed in the house ."
"It was in the little guest-chamber leading from the parlor , and often used when the lads were poorly , for it saved Mrs. Jo from running up and down , and the invalids could see what was going on ."
"When it was ready , Mr. Bhaer took the boy in his arms , and carried him in , helped him undress , laid him on the little white bed , and left him with another hand-shake , and a fatherly `` Good-night , my son . ''"
"There 's hills and heather enough between here and the two seas , David ; and I will own I 'm no very keen to stay where I 'm no wanted . ''"
"This pierced me like a sword , and seemed to lay bare my private disloyalty ."
`` Alan Breck ! ''
I cried ; and then : `` Do you think I am one to turn my back on you in your chief need ?
You durs n't say it to my face .
My whole conduct 's there to give the lie to it .
"It 's true , I fell asleep upon the muir ; but that was from weariness , and you do wrong to cast it up to me -- '' `` Which is what I never did , '' said Alan ."
"`` But aside from that , '' I continued , `` what have I done that you should even me to dogs by such a supposition ?"
"I never yet failed a friend , and it 's not likely I 'll begin with you ."
"There are things between us that I can never forget , even if you can . ''"
"`` I will only say this to ye , David , '' said Alan , very quietly , `` that I have long been owing ye my life , and now I owe ye money ."
Ye should try to make that burden light for me . ''
"This ought to have touched me , and in a manner it did , but the wrong manner ."
"I felt I was behaving badly ; and was now not only angry with Alan , but angry with myself in the bargain ; and it made me the more cruel ."
"`` You asked me to speak , '' said I. `` Well , then , I will ."
"You own yourself that you have done me a disservice ; I have had to swallow an affront : I have never reproached you , I never named the thing till you did ."
"And now you blame me , '' cried I , `` because I cannae laugh and sing as if I was glad to be affronted ."
The next thing will be that I 'm to go down upon my knees and thank you for it !
"Ye should think more of others , Alan Breck ."
"If ye thought more of others , ye would perhaps speak less about yourself ; and when a friend that likes you very well has passed over an offence without a word , you would be blithe to let it lie , instead of making it a stick to break his back with ."
"By your own way of it , it was you that was to blame ; then it shouldnae be you to seek the quarrel . ''"
"`` Aweel , '' said Alan , `` say nae mair . ''"
"And we fell back into our former silence ; and came to our journey 's end , and supped , and lay down to sleep , without another word ."
"The gillie put us across Loch Rannoch in the dusk of the next day , and gave us his opinion as to our best route ."
"This was to get us up at once into the tops of the mountains : to go round by a circuit , turning the heads of Glen Lyon , Glen Lochay , and Glen Dochart , and come down upon the lowlands by Kippen and the upper waters of the Forth ."
"Alan was little pleased with a route which led us through the country of his blood-foes , the Glenorchy Campbells ."
"He objected that by turning to the east , we should come almost at once among the Athole Stewarts , a race of his own name and lineage , although following a different chief , and come besides by a far easier and swifter way to the place whither we were bound ."
"But the gillie , who was indeed the chief man of Cluny 's scouts , had good reasons to give him on all hands , naming the force of troops in every district , and alleging finally -LRB- as well as I could understand -RRB- that we should nowhere be so little troubled as in a country of the Campbells ."
"Alan gave way at last , but with only half a heart ."
"`` It 's one of the dowiest countries in Scotland , '' said he ."
"`` There 's naething there that I ken , but heath , and crows , and Campbells ."
But I see that ye 're a man of some penetration ; and be it as ye please ! ''
"I turned my back , accordingly , upon the sea , and did not look again till I had counted many hundreds ."
The boat was still heading for the island .
"The next time I counted the full thousand , as slowly as I could , my heart beating so as to hurt me ."
And then it was out of all question .
She was coming straight to Earraid !
"I could no longer hold myself back , but ran to the seaside and out , from one rock to another , as far as I could go ."
"It is a marvel I was not drowned ; for when I was brought to a stand at last , my legs shook under me , and my mouth was so dry , I must wet it with the sea-water before I was able to shout ."
All this time the boat was coming on ; and now I was able to perceive it was the same boat and the same two men as yesterday .
"This I knew by their hair , which the one had of a bright yellow and the other black ."
"But now there was a third man along with them , who looked to be of a better class ."
"As soon as they were come within easy speech , they let down their sail and lay quiet ."
"In spite of my supplications , they drew no nearer in , and what frightened me most of all , the new man tee-hee 'd with laughter as he talked and looked at me ."
"Then he stood up in the boat and addressed me a long while , speaking fast and with many wavings of his hand ."
"I told him I had no Gaelic ; and at this he became very angry , and I began to suspect he thought he was talking English ."
"Listening very close , I caught the word `` whateffer '' several times ; but all the rest was Gaelic and might have been Greek and Hebrew for me ."
"`` Whatever , '' said I , to show him I had caught a word ."
"`` Yes , yes -- yes , yes , '' says he , and then he looked at the other men , as much as to say , `` I told you I spoke English , '' and began again as hard as ever in the Gaelic ."
"This time I picked out another word , `` tide . ''"
Then I had a flash of hope .
I remembered he was always waving his hand towards the mainland of the Ross .
`` Do you mean when the tide is out -- ? ''
"I cried , and could not finish ."
"`` Yes , yes , '' said he ."
`` Tide . ''
"At that I turned tail upon their boat -LRB- where my adviser had once more begun to tee-hee with laughter -RRB- , leaped back the way I had come , from one stone to another , and set off running across the isle as I had never run before ."
"In about half an hour I came out upon the shores of the creek ; and , sure enough , it was shrunk into a little trickle of water , through which I dashed , not above my knees , and landed with a shout on the main island ."
"A sea-bred boy would not have stayed a day on Earraid ; which is only what they call a tidal islet , and except in the bottom of the neaps , can be entered and left twice in every twenty-four hours , either dry-shod , or at the most by wading ."
"Even I , who had the tide going out and in before me in the bay , and even watched for the ebbs , the better to get my shellfish -- even I -LRB- I say -RRB- if I had sat down to think , instead of raging at my fate , must have soon guessed the secret , and got free ."
It was no wonder the fishers had not understood me .
"The wonder was rather that they had ever guessed my pitiful illusion , and taken the trouble to come back ."
I had starved with cold and hunger on that island for close upon one hundred hours .
"But for the fishers , I might have left my bones there , in pure folly ."
"The ground became more and more uneven , full of pits and hillocks ."
"And with every step of the ascent the wind still blew the shriller , and the trees bent before the gusts like fishing-rods ."
"They had just entered one of the clearings , when Dick suddenly clapped down upon his face among the brambles , and began to crawl slowly backward towards the shelter of the grove ."
"Matcham , in great bewilderment , for he could see no reason for this flight , still imitated his companion 's course ; and it was not until they had gained the harbour of a thicket that he turned and begged him to explain ."
"For all reply , Dick pointed with his finger ."
"At the far end of the clearing , a fir grew high above the neighbouring wood , and planted its black shock of foliage clear against the sky ."
For about fifty feet above the ground the trunk grew straight and solid like a column .
"At that level , it split into two massive boughs ; and in the fork , like a mast-headed seaman , there stood a man in a green tabard , spying far and wide ."
"The sun glistened upon his hair ; with one hand he shaded his eyes to look abroad , and he kept slowly rolling his head from side to side , with the regularity of a machine ."
The lads exchanged glances .
"`` Let us try to the left , '' said Dick ."
"`` We had near fallen foully , Jack . ''"
Ten minutes afterwards they struck into a beaten path .
"`` Here is a piece of forest that I know not , '' Dick remarked ."
`` Where goeth me this track ? ''
"`` Let us even try , '' said Matcham ."
"A few yards further , the path came to the top of a ridge and began to go down abruptly into a cup-shaped hollow ."
"At the foot , out of a thick wood of flowering hawthorn , two or three roofless gables , blackened as if by fire , and a single tall chimney marked the ruins of a house ."
`` What may this be ? ''
whispered Matcham .
"`` Nay , by the mass , I know not , '' answered Dick ."
`` I am all at sea .
Let us go warily . ''
"With beating hearts , they descended through the hawthorns ."
"Here and there , they passed signs of recent cultivation ; fruit trees and pot herbs ran wild among the thicket ; a sun-dial had fallen in the grass ; it seemed they were treading what once had been a garden ."
Yet a little farther and they came forth before the ruins of the house .
It had been a pleasant mansion and a strong .
"A dry ditch was dug deep about it ; but it was now choked with masonry , and bridged by a fallen rafter ."
"The two farther walls still stood , the sun shining through their empty windows ; but the remainder of the building had collapsed , and now lay in a great cairn of ruin , grimed with fire ."
Already in the interior a few plants were springing green among the chinks .
"`` Now I bethink me , '' whispered Dick , `` this must be Grimstone ."
It was a hold of one Simon Malmesbury ; Sir Daniel was his bane !
Did you ever see such a rookery ?
And perched right close to the road too .
An old house with its windows gone always makes me think of something dead with its eyes picked out . ''
"`` I think an old , deserted house is such a sad sight , '' said Anne dreamily ."
`` It always seems to me to be thinking about its past and mourning for its old-time joys .
"Marilla says that a large family was raised in that old house long ago , and that it was a real pretty place , with a lovely garden and roses climbing all over it ."
"It was full of little children and laughter and songs ; and now it is empty , and nothing ever wanders through it but the wind ."
How lonely and sorrowful it must feel !
Perhaps they all come back on moonlit nights ... the ghosts of the little children of long ago and the roses and the songs ... and for a little while the old house can dream it is young and joyous again . ''
Diana shook her head .
"`` I never imagine things like that about places now , Anne ."
Do n't you remember how cross mother and Marilla were when we imagined ghosts into the Haunted Wood ?
To this day I ca n't go through that bush comfortably after dark ; and if I began imagining such things about the old Boulter house I 'd be frightened to pass it too .
"Besides , those children are n't dead ."
They 're all grown up and doing well ... and one of them is a butcher .
And flowers and songs could n't have ghosts anyhow . ''
Anne smothered a little sigh .
She loved Diana dearly and they had always been good comrades .
But she had long ago learned that when she wandered into the realm of fancy she must go alone .
The way to it was by an enchanted path where not even her dearest might follow her .
"A thunder-shower came up while the girls were at Carmody ; it did not last long , however , and the drive home , through lanes where the raindrops sparkled on the boughs and little leafy valleys where the drenched ferns gave out spicy odors , was delightful ."
But just as they turned into the Cuthbert lane Anne saw something that spoiled the beauty of the landscape for her .
"Before them on the right extended Mr. Harrison 's broad , gray-green field of late oats , wet and luxuriant ; and there , standing squarely in the middle of it , up to her sleek sides in the lush growth , and blinking at them calmly over the intervening tassels , was a Jersey cow !"
Anne dropped the reins and stood up with a tightening of the lips that boded no good to the predatory quadruped .
"Not a word said she , but she climbed nimbly down over the wheels , and whisked across the fence before Diana understood what had happened ."
"`` Anne , come back , '' shrieked the latter , as soon as she found her voice ."
`` You 'll ruin your dress in that wet grain ... ruin it .
She does n't hear me !
"Well , she 'll never get that cow out by herself ."
"I must go and help her , of course . ''"
Anne was charging through the grain like a mad thing .
"Diana hopped briskly down , tied the horse securely to a post , turned the skirt of her pretty gingham dress over her shoulders , mounted the fence , and started in pursuit of her frantic friend ."
cried his daughter .
"` Well , that is not worth much , my dear , ' said he ."
"` Besides , you have rings enough , I should think . '"
"` Never mind , I like it , ' replied the princess ."
"But as soon as she was alone , to her amazement , the ring suddenly left her finger and became a man ."
"You can imagine how frightened she was , as , indeed , anybody would have been ; but in an instant the man became a ring again , and then turned back to a man , and so it went on for some time until she began to get used to these sudden changes . '"
"I am sorry I frightened you , ' said Hans , when he thought he could safely speak to the princess without making her scream . '"
"I took refuge with you because the old hill-man , whom I have offended , was trying to kill me , and here I am safe . '"
"` You had better stay here then , ' said the princess ."
"So Hans stayed , and he and she became good friends ; though , of course , he only became a man when no one else was present ."
"This was all very well ; but , one day , as they were talking together , the king happened to enter the room , and although Hans quickly changed himself into a ring again it was too late ."
The king was terribly angry .
` So this is why you have refused to marry all the kings and princes who have sought your hand ? '
he cried .
"And , without waiting for her to speak , he commanded that his daughter should be walled up in the summer-house and starved to death with her lover ."
"That evening the poor princess , still wearing her ring , was put into the summer-house with enough food to last for three days , and the door was bricked up ."
"But at the end of a week or two the king thought it was time to give her a grand funeral , in spite of her bad behaviour , and he had the summer-house opened ."
"He could hardly believe his eyes when he found that the princess was not there , nor Hans either ."
"Instead , there lay at his feet a large hole , big enough for two people to pass through ."
Now what had happened was this .
"When the princess and Hans had given up hope , and cast themselves down on the ground to die , they fell down this hole , and right through the earth as well , and at last they tumbled into a castle built of pure gold at the other side of the world , and there they lived happily ."
"But of this , of course , the king knew nothing ."
` Will anyone go down and see where the passage leads to ? '
"he asked , turning to his guards and courtiers . '"
I will reward splendidly the man who is brave enough to explore it . '
For a long time nobody answered .
"The hole was dark and deep , and if it had a bottom no one could see it ."
"At length a soldier , who was a careless sort of fellow , offered himself for the service , and cautiously lowered himself into the darkness ."
"But in a moment he , too , fell down , down , down ."
"Was he going to fall for ever , he wondered !"
"Oh , how thankful he was in the end to reach the castle , and to meet the princess and Hans , looking quite well and not at all as if they had been starved ."
"They began to talk , and the soldier told them that the king was very sorry for the way he had treated his daughter , and wished day and night that he could have her back again ."
"` We must rest here as best we can , ' spoke Covan to the cows ."
And they bowed their heads and lay down in the place where they stood .
"Then came the black raven of Corri-nan-creag , whose eyes never closed , and whose wings never tired ; and he fluttered before the face of Covan and told him that he knew of a cranny in the rock where there was food in plenty , and soft moss for a bed ."
"` Go with me thither , ' he said to Covan , ` and you shall lay aside three-thirds of your weariness , and depart in the morning refreshed , ' and Covan listened thankfully to his words , and at dawn he rose up to seek his cows ."
` Farewell ! '
cried the black raven .
"` You trusted me , and took all I had to offer in return for the food you once gave me ."
"So if in time to come you need a friend , wish for me , and I will not fail you . '"
"As before , the cows were standing in the spot where he had left them , ready to set out ."
"All that day they walked , on and on , and on , Covan son of Gorla walking behind them , till night fell while they were on the banks of a river ."
"` We can go no further , ' spake Covan to the cows ."
"And they began to eat the grass by the side of the stream , while Covan listened to them and longed for some supper also , for they had travelled far , and his limbs were weak under him ."
"Then there was a swish of water at his feet , and out peeped the head of the famous otter Doran-donn of the stream ."
"` Trust to me and I will find you warmth and shelter , ' said Doran-donn ; ` and for food fish in plenty . '"
"And Covan went with him thankfully , and ate and rested , and laid aside three-thirds of his weariness ."
"At sunrise he left his bed of dried sea-weed , which had floated up with the tide , and with a grateful heart bade farewell to Doran-donn ."
"` Because you trusted me and took what I had to offer , you have made me your friend , Covan , ' said Doran-donn ."
"` And if you should be in danger , and need help from one who can swim a river or dive beneath a wave , call to me and I will come to you . '"
"Then he plunged into the stream , and was seen no more ."
"The cows were standing ready in the place where Covan had left them , and they journeyed on all that day , till , when night fell , they reached the cottage ."
"Joyful indeed was the old man as the cows went into their stables , and he beheld the rich milk that flowed into the pail of the golden-haired maiden with the silver comb ."
"` You have done well indeed , ' he said to Covan son of Gorla ."
"` And now , what would you have as a reward ? ' '"
"I want nothing for myself , ' answered Covan the Brown-haired ; ` but I ask you to give me back my brothers and my sister who have been lost to us for three years past ."
"You are wise and know the lore of fairies and of witches ; tell me where I can find them , and what I must do to bring them to life again . '"
The old man looked grave at the words of Covan .
"` Yes , truly I know where they are , ' answered he , ` and I say not that they may not be brought to life again ."
But the perils are great -- too great for you to overcome . '
"` Tell me what they are , ' said Covan again , ` and I shall know better if I may overcome them . '"
"` Listen , then , and judge ."
"In the mountain yonder there dwells a roe , white of foot , with horns that branch like the antlers of a deer ."
On the lake that leads to the land of the Sun floats a duck whose body is green and whose neck is of gold .
"And for the exposure -- if ye were an ugly hunchback , and the children gecked at you upon the street , ye would count your body cheaper , and an hour of glory worth a life ."
"Howbeit , if ye will , let us ride on and visit the other posts ."
"Sir Richard here , my namesake , he shall still hold this entry , where he wadeth to the ankles in hot blood ."
Him can we trust .
"But mark it , Sir Richard , ye are not yet done ."
The worst is yet to ward .
Sleep not . ''
"He came right up to young Shelton , looking him hard in the eyes , and taking his hand in both of his , gave it so extreme a squeeze that the blood had nearly spurted ."
Dick quailed before his eyes .
"The insane excitement , the courage , and the cruelty that he read therein filled him with dismay about the future ."
"This young duke 's was indeed a gallant spirit , to ride foremost in the ranks of war ; but after the battle , in the days of peace and in the circle of his trusted friends , that mind , it was to be dreaded , would continue to bring forth the fruits of death ."
"CHAPTER III -- THE BATTLE OF SHOREBY -LRB- Concluded -RRB- Dick , once more left to his own counsels , began to look about him ."
The arrow-shot had somewhat slackened .
"On all sides the enemy were falling back ; and the greater part of the market-place was now left empty , the snow here trampled into orange mud , there splashed with gore , scattered all over with dead men and horses , and bristling thick with feathered arrows ."
On his own side the loss had been cruel .
"The jaws of the little street and the ruins of the barricade were heaped with the dead and dying ; and out of the hundred men with whom he had begun the battle , there were not seventy left who could still stand to arms ."
"At the same time , the day was passing ."
"The first reinforcements might be looked for to arrive at any moment ; and the Lancastrians , already shaken by the result of their desperate but unsuccessful onslaught , were in an ill temper to support a fresh invader ."
"There was a dial in the wall of one of the two flanking houses ; and this , in the frosty winter sunshine , indicated ten of the forenoon ."
"Dick turned to the man who was at his elbow , a little insignificant archer , binding a cut in his arm ."
"`` It was well fought , '' he said , `` and , by my sooth , they will not charge us twice . ''"
"`` Sir , '' said the little archer , `` ye have fought right well for York , and better for yourself ."
Never hath man in so brief space prevailed so greatly on the duke 's affections .
That he should have entrusted such a post to one he knew not is a marvel .
"But look to your head , Sir Richard !"
"If ye be vanquished -- ay , if ye give way one foot 's breadth -- axe or cord shall punish it ; and I am set if ye do aught doubtful , I will tell you honestly , here to stab you from behind . ''"
Dick looked at the little man in amaze .
`` You ! ''
he cried .
`` And from behind ! ''
"`` It is right so , '' returned the archer ; `` and because I like not the affair I tell it you ."
"Ye must make the post good , Sir Richard , at your peril ."
"` Summer can not show a more beautiful sight , ' she said , with her eyes shining ."
"` And one ca n't get a fellow like this in summer either , ' said the young man , pointing to the Snow-man ."
` He 's a beauty ! '
"The girl laughed , and nodded to the Snow-man , and then they both danced away over the snow ."
` Who were those two ? '
asked the Snow-man of the yard-dog .
` You have been in this yard longer than I have .
Do you know who they are ? '
` Do I know them indeed ? '
answered the yard-dog .
"` She has often stroked me , and he has given me bones ."
I do n't bite either of them ! '
` But what are they ? '
asked the Snow-man .
` Lovers ! '
replied the yard-dog .
"Turley fell to the tomahawk of the terrible Panther , who ultimately cut a way through the pirates with Tiger Lily and a small remnant of the tribe ."
To what extent Hook is to blame for his tactics on this occasion is for the historian to decide .
Had he waited on the rising ground till the proper hour he and his men would probably have been butchered ; and in judging him it is only fair to take this into account .
What he should perhaps have done was to acquaint his opponents that he proposed to follow a new method .
"On the other hand , this , as destroying the element of surprise , would have made his strategy of no avail , so that the whole question is beset with difficulties ."
"One can not at least withhold a reluctant admiration for the wit that had conceived so bold a scheme , and the fell -LSB- deadly -RSB- genius with which it was carried out ."
What were his own feelings about himself at that triumphant moment ?
"Fain -LSB- gladly -RSB- would his dogs have known , as breathing heavily and wiping their cutlasses , they gathered at a discreet distance from his hook , and squinted through their ferret eyes at this extraordinary man ."
"Elation must have been in his heart , but his face did not reflect it : ever a dark and solitary enigma , he stood aloof from his followers in spirit as in substance ."
"The night 's work was not yet over , for it was not the redskins he had come out to destroy ; they were but the bees to be smoked , so that he should get at the honey ."
"It was Pan he wanted , Pan and Wendy and their band , but chiefly Pan ."
Peter was such a small boy that one tends to wonder at the man 's hatred of him .
"True he had flung Hook 's arm to the crocodile , but even this and the increased insecurity of life to which it led , owing to the crocodile 's pertinacity -LSB- persistance -RSB- , hardly account for a vindictiveness so relentless and malignant ."
The truth is that there was a something about Peter which goaded the pirate captain to frenzy .
"It was not his courage , it was not his engaging appearance , it was not -- ."
"There is no beating about the bush , for we know quite well what it was , and have got to tell ."
"This was a very important point , and needed much discussion ."
A thousand names were proposed and rejected for a thousand silly reasons .
"One was another reminded the queen of somebody she did not like ; but at length an idea flashed into the queen 's head , and she called out : ' I know !"
We will call her Muffette . '
"` That is the very thing , ' shouted the frog , jumping high into the air ; and so it was settled ."
The princess Muffette was about six months old when the frog noticed that the queen had begun to grow sad again .
` Why do you have that look in your eyes ? '
"she asked one day , when she had come in to play with the baby , who could now crawl ."
"The way they played their game was to let Muffette creep close to the frog , and then for the frog to bound high into the air and alight on the child 's head , or back , or legs , when she always sent up a shout of pleasure ."
"There is no play fellow like a frog ; but then it must be a fairy frog , or else you might hurt it , and if you did something dreadful might happen to you ."
"Well , as I have said , our frog was struck with the queen 's sad face , and lost no time in asking her what was the reason . '"
"I do n't see what you have to complain of now ; Muffette is quite well and quite happy , and even the Lion Fairy is kind to her when she sees her ."
What is it ? '
` Oh !
if her father could only see her ! '
"broke forth the queen , clasping her hands ."
` Or if I could only tell him all that has happened since we parted .
"But they will have brought him tidings of the broken carriage , and he will have thought me dead , or devoured by wild beasts ."
"And though he will mourn for me long -- I know that well -- yet in time they will persuade him to take a wife , and she will be young and fair , and he will forget me . '"
"And in all this the queen guessed truly , save that nine long years were to pass before he would consent to put another in her place ."
"The frog answered nothing at the time , but stopped her game and hopped away among the cypress trees ."
"Here she sat and thought and thought , and the next morning she went back to the queen and said : ' I have come , madam , to make you an offer ."
"Shall I go to the king instead of you , and tell him of your sufferings , and that he has the most charming baby in the world for his daughter ?"
"The way is long , and I travel slowly ; but , sooner or later , I shall be sure to arrive ."
"Only , are you not afraid to be left without my protection ?"
Ponder the matter carefully ; it is for you to decide . '
"` Oh , it needs no pondering , ' cried the queen joyfully , holding up her clasped hands , and making Muffette do likewise , in token of gratitude ."
But in order that he may know that you have come from me I will send him a letter . '
"And pricking her arm , she wrote a few words with her blood on the corner of her handkerchief ."
"Then tearing it off , she gave it to the frog , and they bade each other farewell ."
"It took the frog a year and four days to mount the ten thousand steps that led to the upper world , but that was because she was still under the spell of a wicked fairy ."
"By the time she reached the top , she was so tired that she had to remain for another year on the banks of a stream to rest , and also to arrange the procession with which she was to present herself before the king ."
"You see , sir , here it is ."
"I get a rough answer , do I not ?"
"Well , if I speak back , pikes will be going in two shakes ; if I do n't , Silver will see there 's something under that , and the game 's up ."
"Now , we 've only one man to rely on . ''"
`` And who is that ? ''
asked the squire .
"`` Silver , sir , '' returned the captain ; `` he 's as anxious as you and I to smother things up ."
"This is a tiff ; he 'd soon talk 'em out of it if he had the chance , and what I propose to do is to give him the chance ."
Let 's allow the men an afternoon ashore .
"If they all go , why we 'll fight the ship ."
"If they none of them go , well then , we hold the cabin , and God defend the right ."
"If some go , you mark my words , sir , Silver 'll bring 'em aboard again as mild as lambs . ''"
"It was so decided ; loaded pistols were served out to all the sure men ; Hunter , Joyce , and Redruth were taken into our confidence and received the news with less surprise and a better spirit than we had looked for , and then the captain went on deck and addressed the crew ."
"`` My lads , '' said he , `` we 've had a hot day and are all tired and out of sorts ."
"A turn ashore 'll hurt nobody -- the boats are still in the water ; you can take the gigs , and as many as please may go ashore for the afternoon ."
I 'll fire a gun half an hour before sundown . ''
"I believe the silly fellows must have thought they would break their shins over treasure as soon as they were landed , for they all came out of their sulks in a moment and gave a cheer that started the echo in a faraway hill and sent the birds once more flying and squalling round the anchorage ."
The captain was too bright to be in the way .
"He whipped out of sight in a moment , leaving Silver to arrange the party , and I fancy it was as well he did so ."
"Had he been on deck , he could no longer so much as have pretended not to understand the situation ."
It was as plain as day .
"Silver was the captain , and a mighty rebellious crew he had of it ."
The honest hands -- and I was soon to see it proved that there were such on board -- must have been very stupid fellows .
"Or rather , I suppose the truth was this , that all hands were disaffected by the example of the ringleaders -- only some more , some less ; and a few , being good fellows in the main , could neither be led nor driven any further ."
It is one thing to be idle and skulk and quite another to take a ship and murder a number of innocent men .
"At last , however , the party was made up ."
"Six fellows were to stay on board , and the remaining thirteen , including Silver , began to embark ."
Then it was that there came into my head the first of the mad notions that contributed so much to save our lives .
"If six men were left by Silver , it was plain our party could not take and fight the ship ; and since only six were left , it was equally plain that the cabin party had no present need of my assistance ."
It occurred to me at once to go ashore .
"In a jiffy I had slipped over the side and curled up in the fore-sheets of the nearest boat , and almost at the same moment she shoved off ."
"No one took notice of me , only the bow oar saying , `` Is that you , Jim ?"
"""YES, I KNOW WELL ENOUGH WHERE IT IS,"" said the North Wind; ""once in my life I blew an aspen-leaf thither, but, I was so tired I couldn't blow a puff for ever so many days, after. But if you really wish to go thither, and aren't afraid to come along with me, I'll take you on my back and see if I can blow you thither."""
"Yes! with all her heart; she must and would get thither if it were possible in any way; and as for fear, however madly he went, she wouldn't be at all afraid."
"""Very well, then,"" said the North Wind, ""but you must sleep here to-night, for we must have the whole day before us, if we're to get thither at all."""
"Early next morning the North Wind woke her, and puffed himself up, and blew himself out, and made himself so stout and big, 'twas gruesome to look at him; and so off they went high up through the air, as if they would never stop till they got to the world's end."
"Down here below there was such a storm; it threw down long tracts of wood and many houses, and when it swept over the great sea, ships foundered by hundreds."
"So they tore on and on no one can believe how far they went and all the while they still went over the sea, and the North Wind got more and more weary, and so out of breath he could scarce bring out a puff, and his wings drooped and drooped, till at last he sunk so low that the crests of the waves dashed over his heels."
"""Are you afraid?"" said the North Wind."
"""No!"" she wasn't."
"But they weren't very far from land; and the North Wind had still so much strength left in him that he managed to throw her up on the shore under the windows of the castle which lay East of the Sun and West of the Moon; but then he was so weak and worn out, he had to stay there and rest many days before he could get home again."
"Next morning the lassie sat down under the castle window, and began to play with the gold apple; and the first person she saw was the Long-nose who was to have the Prince."
"""What do you want for your gold apple, you lassie?"" said the Long-nose, and threw up the window."
"""It's not for sale, for gold or money,"" said the lassie."
"""If it's not for sale for gold or money, what is it that you will sell it for? You may name your own price,"" said the Princess."
"""Well! if I may get to the Prince, who lives here, and be with him to-night, you shall have it,"" said the lassie whom the North Wind had brought."
"Yes! she might; that could be done. So the Princess got the gold apple; but when the lassie came up to the Prince's bed-room at night he was fast asleep; she called him and shook him, and between whiles she wept sore; but all she could do she couldn't wake him up. Next morning, as soon as day broke, came the Princess with the long nose, and drove her out again."
"So in the daytime she sat down under the castle windows and began to card with her carding-comb, and the same thing happened. The Princess asked what she wanted for it; and she said it wasn't for sale for gold or money, but if she might get leave to go up to the Prince and be with him that night, the Princess should have it."
"But when she went up she found him fast asleep again, and all she called, and all she shook, and wept, and prayed, she couldn't get life into him; and as soon as the first gray peep of day came, then came the Princess with the long nose, and chased her out again."
"So, in the daytime, the lassie sat down outside under the castle window, and began to spin with her golden spinning-wheel, and that, too, the Princess with the long nose wanted to have. So she threw up the window and asked what she wanted for it. The lassie said, as she had said twice before, it wasn't for sale for gold or money; but if she might go up to the Prince who was there, and be with him alone that night, she might have it."
"Yes! she might do that and welcome. But now you must know there were some Christian folk who had been carried off thither, and as they sat in their room, which was next the Prince, they had heard how a woman had been in there, and wept and prayed, and called to him two nights running, and they told that to the Prince."
"That evening, when the Princess came with her sleepy drink, the Prince made as if he drank, but threw it over his shoulder, for he could guess it was a sleepy drink. So, when the lassie came in, she found the Prince wide awake; and then she told him the whole story how she had come thither."
"""Ah,"" said the Prince, ""you've just come in the very nick of time, for to-morrow is to be our wedding-day; but now I won't have the Long-nose, and you are the only woman in the world who can set me free. I'll say I want to see what my wife is fit for, and beg her to wash the shirt which has the three spots of tallow on it; she'll say yes, for she doesn't know 'tis you who put them there; but that's a work only for Christian folk, and not for such a pack of Trolls, and so I'll say that I won't have any other for my bride than the woman who can wash them out, and ask you to do it."""
"So there was great joy and love between them all that night. But next day, when the wedding was to be, the Prince said:"
"""First of all, I'd like to see what my bride is fit for."""
"""Yes!"" said the step-mother, with all her heart."
"""Well,"" said the Prince, ""I've got a fine shirt which I'd like for my wedding shirt, but somehow or other it has got three spots of tallow on it, which I must have washed out; and I have sworn never to take any other bride than the woman who's able to do that. If she can't, she's not worth having."""
"Well, that was no great thing they said, so they agreed, and she with the long-nose began to wash away as hard as she could, but the more she rubbed and scrubbed, the bigger the spots grew."
"""Ah!"" said the old hag, her mother, ""you can't wash; let me try."""
"But she hadn't long taken the shirt in hand before it got far worse than ever, and with all her rubbing, and wringing, and scrubbing, the spots grew bigger and blacker, and the darker and uglier was the shirt."
"Then all the other Trolls began to wash, but the longer it lasted, the blacker and uglier the shirt grew, till at last it was as black all over as if it had been up the chimney."
"""Ah!"" said the Prince, ""you're none of you worth a straw; you can't wash. Why there, outside, sits a beggar lassie, I'll be bound she knows how to wash better than the whole lot of you. COME IN, LASSIE!"""
he shouted.
"Presently the cab drew up near the pillar, and there was the dragon, his ugly purple head shining in the sun, and his ugly purple mouth half open."
"Uncle James said: ""Good morning, sir. We have brought you a small present for your birthday. We do not like to let such an anniversary go by without some suitable testimonial, especially to one who is a stranger in our midst. Our means are small, but our hearts are large. We have but one Princess, but we give her freely do we not, my child?"""
"The Princess said she supposed so, and the dragon came a little nearer."
"Suddenly a voice cried: ""Run!"" and there was Tom, and he had brought the Zoological guinea pig and a pair of Belgian hares with him. ""Just to see fair,"" said Tom."
"Uncle James was furious. ""What do you mean, sir,"" he cried, ""by intruding on a State function with your common rabbits and things? Go away, naughty little boy, and play with them somewhere else."""
"But while he was speaking the rabbits had come up one on each side of him, their great sides towering ever so high, and now they pressed him between them so that he was buried in their thick fur and almost choked."
"The Princess, meantime, had run to the other side of the pillar and was peeping around it to see what was going on. A crowd had followed the cab out of the town; now they reached the scene of the ""State Function"" and they all cried out: ""Fair play play fair! We can't go back on our word like this. Give a thing and take a thing? Why, it's never done. Let the poor exiled stranger dragon have his birthday present."" And they tried to get at Tom but the guinea pig stood in the way."
"""Yes,"" Tom cried. ""Fair play is a jewel. And your helpless exile shall have the Princess if he can catch her. Now then, Mary Ann."""
"Mary Ann looked around the big pillar and called to the dragon: ""Bo! you can't catch me,"" and began to run as fast as ever she could, and the dragon ran after her. When the Princess had run a half mile she stopped, dodged around a tree, and ran back to the pillar and around it, and the dragon after her. You see, he was so long he could not turn as quickly as she could. Around and around the pillar ran the Princess. The first time she ran around a long way from the pillar, and then nearer and nearer with the dragon after her all the time; and he was so busy trying to catch her that he never noticed that Tom had tied the very end of his long, tight, whipcordy tail to the rock, so that the more the dragon ran around, the more times he twisted his tail around the pillar."
"It was exactly like winding a top only the peg was the pillar, and the dragon's tail was the string. And the magician was safe between the Belgian hares, and couldn't see anything but darkness, or do anything but choke."
"When the dragon was wound onto the pillar as much as he possibly could be, and as tight like cotton on a reel the Princess stopped running, and though she had very little breath left, she managed to say, ""Yah who's won now?"""
"This annoyed the dragon so much that he put out all his strength spread his great purple wings, and tried to fly at her. Of course this pulled his tail, and pulled it very hard, so hard that as he pulled the tail had to come, and the pillar had to come around with the tail, and the island had to come around with the pillar, and in another minute the tail was loose, and the island was spinning around exactly like a top. It spun so fast that everyone fell flat on their faces and held on tight to themselves, because they felt something was going to happen."
"All but the magician, who was choking between the Belgian hares, and felt nothing but fur and fury."
"And something did happen. The dragon had sent the kingdom of Rotundia spinning the way it ought to have gone at the beginning of the world, and as it spun around, all the animals began to change sizes. The guinea pigs got small, and the elephants got big, and the men and women and children would have changed sizes too, if they had not had the sense to hold on to themselves, very tight indeed, with both hands; which, of course, the animals could not be expected to know how to do. And the best of it was that when the small beasts got big and the big beasts got small the dragon got small too, and fell at the Princess's feet a little, crawling, purple newt with wings."
"""Funny little thing,"" said the Princess, when she saw it. ""I will take it for a birthday present."""
"But while all the people were still on their faces, holding on tight to themselves, Uncle James, the magician, never thought of holding tight he only thought of how to punish Belgian hares and the sons of gardeners; so when the big beasts grew small, he grew small with the other beasts, and the little purple dragon, when he fell at the Princess's feet, saw there a very small magician named Uncle James. And the dragon took him because it wanted a birthday present."
"So now all the animals were new sizes and at first it seemed very strange to everyone to have great lumbering elephants and a tiny little dormouse, but they have gotten used to it now, and think no more of it than we do."
"All this happened several years ago, and the other day I saw in the Rotundia Times an account of the wedding of the Princess with Lord Thomas Gardener, K.C.D., and I knew she could not have married anyone but Tom, so I suppose they made him a Lord on purpose for the wedding and K.C.D., of course, means Clever Conqueror of the Dragon."
"If you think that is wrong it is only because you don't know how they spell in Rotundia. The paper said that among the beautiful presents of the bridegroom to the bride was an enormous elephant, on which the bridal pair made their wedding tour. This must have been Fido. You remember Tom promised to give him back to the Princess when they were married. The Rotundia Times called the married couple ""the happy pair."" It was clever of the paper to think of calling them that it is such a pretty and novel expression, and I think it is truer than many of the things you see in papers."
"Because, you see, the Princess and the gardener's son were so fond of each other they could not help being happy and besides, they had an elephant of their very own to ride on. If that is not enough to make people happy, I should like to know what is. Though, of course, I know there are some people who could not be happy unless they had a whale to sail on, and perhaps not even then. But they are greedy, grasping people, the kind who would take four helps of pudding, as likely as not, which neither Tom nor Mary Ann ever did."
III. The Deliverers of Their Country
"It all began with Effie's getting something in her eye. It hurt very much indeed, and it felt something like a red-hot spark only it seemed to have legs as well, and wings like a fly. Effie rubbed and cried not real crying, but the kind your eye does all by itself without your being miserable inside your mind and then she went to her father to have the thing in her eye taken out. Effie's father was a doctor, so of course he knew how to take things out of eyes he did it very cleverly with a soft paintbrush dipped in castor oil."
"When he had gotten the thing out, he said: ""This is very curious."" Effie had often got things in her eye before, and her father had always seemed to think it was natural rather tiresome and naughty perhaps, but still natural. He had never before thought it curious."
"Effie stood holding her handkerchief to her eye, and said: ""I don't believe it's out."" People always say this when they have had something in their eyes."
"""Oh, yes it's out,"" said the doctor. ""Here it is, on the brush. This is very interesting."""
"Effie had never heard her father say that about anything that she had any share in. She said: ""What?"""
"The doctor carried the brush very carefully across the room, and held the point of it under his microscope then he twisted the brass screws of the microscope, and looked through the top with one eye."
"""Dear me,"" he said. ""Dear, dear me! Four well-developed limbs; a long caudal appendage; five toes, unequal in lengths, almost like one of the Lacertidae, yet there are traces of wings."" The creature under his eye wriggled a little in the castor oil, and he went on: ""Yes; a batlike wing. A new specimen, undoubtedly. Effie, run round to the professor and ask him to be kind enough to step in for a few minutes."""
"""You might give me sixpence, Daddy,"" said Effie, ""because I did bring you the new specimen. I took great care of it inside my eye, and my eye does hurt."""
"The doctor was so pleased with the new specimen that he gave Effie a shilling, and presently the professor stepped round. He stayed to lunch, and he and the doctor quarreled very happily all the afternoon about the name and the family of the thing that had come out of Effie's eye."
"In the latter part of 1880, at a time when the Washington monument had reached a height of 160 feet, an adventurous and patriotic cat ascended the interior of the shaft by means of the ropes and tubing. When the workmen arrived at the upper landing the next morning, and began to prepare for the day's work, pussy took fright and, springing to the outer edge, took a ""header"" of 160 feet to the hard earth below. In the descent which was watched closely by two score of men, the cat spread herself out like a flying squirrel and alighted on all fours. After turning over on the ground a few times in a dazed manner, she prepared to leave the grounds and had gotten almost beyond the shadow of the monument, when a dog belonging to one of the workmen pounced upon her and killed her, she, of course, not being in her best running trim, after performing such an extraordinary feat. One of the men procured the body of the dead feline, smoothed out her silky coat, and turned the remains over to a representative of the Smithsonian Institution, who mounted the skin and placed it under a glass case. The label on the case tells this wonderful story in a few words: ""This cat on September 23, 1880, jumped from the top of Washington's monument and lived."""
A Brave Queen
"Long ago, when this country was a wild land, there lived a beautiful and brave queen named Boadicea."
"Her husband, the king, was dead, but she had two daughters whom she loved very much."
"Boadicea was queen of a part of Britain. There were no large towns in her land, but there were forests of fine trees, and fields of corn, and wide stretches of grass-land where many cattle and sheep roamed and fed."
"Her people were called Iceni. They were tall and strong, with blue eyes and yellow hair. The men were brave fighters and good hunters. They hunted the bears and wolves which lived in the forests, and they fought the foes of their beautiful queen."
"They made spears to fight with, and strange carts called war-chariots to fight in. These chariots were drawn by swift horses, and, upon the wheels, long sharp knives were fixed. The Iceni drove the chariots very fast among their foes, and the knives cut down and killed many of them."
The Romans from over the sea were the most dangerous enemies of Boadicea and her people.
"In those days the Romans were the best fighters, and the strongest and wisest people in the world. They came in ships to Britain. They had been told that it was a good country, and they hoped to take it for themselves. Some of them came to Boadicea's land, and took a part of it and of her riches. And when she tried to stop them from doing this, they seized her and the two princesses and beat them cruelly."
"This wicked act made the Iceni very angry. From all parts of the land, fierce fighting-men came marching in haste to avenge themselves on their enemies, bringing with them their spears and their war-chariots. When all were gathered together, they fell upon the Romans."
"There were so many of them, and they were so fierce, that the Romans could not stand against them. Thousands were killed, and the rest ran away to their ships."
"But there were many more Romans in other parts of Britain, and when these heard how their friends had been beaten, they came marching in haste to punish the Iceni."
"The Iceni did their best to get ready to defend themselves, but many of their brave men had been slain and others were wounded and weary, so they could not hope again to win a victory over their strong foes."
"Before the battle, Queen Boadicea, with her fair hair waving in the wind, stood before her soldiers and spoke to them. She told them of the wrong which the Romans had done, and begged them to fight bravely for their country. Then she got into her chariot, and with her daughters lying at her feet, drove to and fro, so that all might see them."
"And the soldiers shouted, and promised to fight to the end for their brave queen."
"They did fight long and bravely, until most of them were killed, but their foes were too strong for them. When Queen Boadicea saw that her brave soldiers were beaten, she drank some poison which killed her. She thought it better to die than to be again taken prisoner by the cruel Romans."
King Alfred and the Cakes
"Once, when good King Alfred of England was forced to flee from his strong foes the Danes, he hid himself in a wood. In this wood, there was a small cottage, and Alfred asked the woman who lived there if he might go in and rest."
"Now the woman did not know the king, but she saw that he was an English soldier, and that he was very tired, so she let him come in and sit in her kitchen."
"Upon the hearth before the fire, some cakes were baking, and the woman told the stranger that if he watched them, and took care that they did not burn, she would give him some supper. Then she went away to do her work."
"At first, King Alfred watched the cakes carefully; when they were well cooked on one side he turned the other to the fire. But, after a time, he began to think of his country, and of his poor people, and then he forgot his task."
"When the woman came back, the cakes were black and burnt. ""You are an idle fellow,"" cried she angrily. ""You would be quite ready to eat the cakes, but you will not take the trouble to watch them."""
"While she was loudly scolding, her husband came home. He knew King Alfred. ""Hush, wife!"" cried he. ""It is our noble lord the king!"""
"When the woman heard this, she was much afraid, and she begged Alfred to forgive her."
"The king smiled, and said: ""I will gladly forgive you for your scolding, good wife, if you will forgive me for spoiling your supper."""
"Not Angles, but Angels"
"In old days the people of England were not all free, as they are now."
"Sometimes young men, and women, and little children were sold as slaves, and had to work hard for their masters."
"Many of these slaves were sent to Rome, for the Romans thought the tall, fair Angles very beautiful, and liked to have them as their servants."
"""Ugh, ugh!"" he said as soon as he got his noses inside the door. ""I smell Christian blood and bone in my house."""
"""Yes, just think! A raven came flying past here with a thigh-bone, which he dropped down the chimney,"" said the Princess. ""I threw it out, but the raven brought it back again. At last I got rid of it and made haste to clean the room, but I suppose the smell is not quite gone,"" she said."
"""No, I can smell it well,"" said the troll; but he was tired and put his heads in the Princess's lap, and she went on scratching them till they all fell a-snoring. Then she called the hens, and the soldier came and cut off all the six heads as if they were set on cabbage stalks."
"She was no less glad than her elder sister, as you may imagine, and danced and sang; but in the midst of their joy they remembered their youngest sister. They went with the soldier across a large courtyard, and, after walking through many, many rooms, he came to the hall of gold where the third sister was."
"She sat at a golden spinning-wheel spinning gold yarn, and the room from ceiling to floor glistened and glittered till it hurt one's eyes."
"""Heaven preserve both you and me, what do you want here?"" said the Princess. ""Go, go, else the troll will kill us both."""
"""Just as well two as one,"" answered the soldier. The Princess cried and wept; but it was all of no use, he must and would remain. Since there was no help for it he would have to try if he could use the troll's sword on the table in the front hall. But he was only just able to move it; it was still larger and heavier than the other two swords."
"He then had to take the horn down from the wall and take three draughts from it, but was only just able to stir the sword. When he had taken three more draughts he could lift it, and when he had taken another three he swung it as easily as if it had been a feather."
"The Princess then settled with the soldier to do the same as her sisters had done. As soon as the troll was well asleep she would call the hens, and he must then make haste and come in and put an end to the troll."
"All of a sudden they heard such a thundering, rambling noise, as if the walls and roof were tumbling in."
"""Ugh! Ugh! I smell Christian blood and bone in my house,"" said the troll, sniffing with all his nine noses."
"""Yes, you never saw the like! Just now a raven flew past here and dropped a human bone down the chimney. I threw it out, but the raven brought it back, and this went on for some time,"" said the Princess; but she got it buried at last, she said, and she had both swept and cleaned the place, but she supposed it still smelt."
"""Yes, I can smell it well,"" said the troll."
"""Come here and lie down in my lap and I will scratch your heads,"" said the Princess. ""The smell will be all gone when you awake."""
"He did so, and when he was snoring at his best she put stools and cushions under the heads so that she could get away to call the hens."
"The soldier then came in in his stockinged feet and struck at the troll, so that eight of the heads fell off at one blow. But the sword was too short and did not reach far enough; the ninth head woke up and began to roar."
"""Ugh! Ugh! I smell a Christian."""
"""Yes, here he is,"" answered the soldier, and before the troll could get up and seize hold of him the soldier struck him another blow and the last head rolled along the floor."
You can well imagine how glad the Princesses became now that they no longer had to sit and scratch the trolls' heads; they did not know how they could do enough for him who had saved them. The youngest Princess took off her gold ring and knotted it in his hair. They then took with them as much gold and silver as they thought they could carry and set off on their way home.
"As soon as they tugged at the rope the captain and the lieutenant pulled up the Princesses, the one after the other. But when they were safely up, the soldier thought it was foolish of him not to have gone up before the Princesses, for he had not very much belief in his comrades. He thought he would first try them, so he put a heavy lump of gold in the basket and got out of the way. When the basket was half-way up they cut the rope and the lump of gold fell to the bottom with such a crash that the pieces flew about his ears."
"""Now we are rid of him,"" they said, and threatened the Princesses with their life if they did not say that it was they who had saved them from the trolls. They were forced to agree to this, much against their will, and especially the youngest Princess; but life was precious, and so the two who were strongest had their way."
"When the captain and lieutenant got home with the Princesses you may be sure there were great rejoicings at the palace. The King was so glad he didn't know which leg to stand on; he brought out his best wine from his cupboard and wished the two officers welcome. If they had never been honoured before they were honoured now in full measure, and no mistake. They walked and strutted about the whole of the day, as if they were the cocks of the walk, since they were now going to have the King for father-in-law. For it was understood they should each have whichever of the Princesses they liked and half the kingdom between them. They both wanted the youngest Princess, but for all they prayed and threatened her it was of no use; she would not hear or listen to either."
They then asked the King if they might have twelve men to watch over her; she was so sad and melancholy since she had been in the mountain that they were afraid she might do something to herself.
"Yes, that they might have, and the King himself told the watch they must look well after her and follow her wherever she went and stood."
"They then began to prepare for the wedding of the two eldest sisters; it should be such a wedding as never was heard or spoken of before, and there was no end to the brewing and the baking and the slaughtering."
"In the meantime the soldier walked and strolled about down in the other world. He thought it was hard that he should see neither people nor daylight any more; but he would have to do something, he thought, and so for many days he went about from room to room and opened all the drawers and cupboards and searched about on the shelves and looked at all the fine things that were there. At last he came to a drawer in a table, in which there lay a golden key; he tried this key to all the locks he could find, but there was none it fitted till he came to a little cupboard over the bed, and in that he found an old rusty whistle. ""I wonder if there is any sound in it,"" he thought, and put it to his mouth. No sooner had he whistled than he heard a whizzing and a whirring from all quarters, and such a large flock of birds swept down, that they blackened all the field in which they settled."
"""What does our master want to-day?"" they asked."
"If he were their master, the soldier said, he would like to know if they could tell him how to get up to the earth again. No, none of them knew anything about that; ""But our mother has not yet arrived,"" they said; ""if she can't help you, no one can."""
"So he whistled once more, and shortly heard something flapping its wings far away, and then it began to blow so hard that he was carried away between the houses like a wisp of hay across the courtyard, and if he had not caught hold of the fence he would no doubt have been blown away altogether."
A big eagle bigger than you can imagine then swooped down in front of him.
"""You come rather sharply,"" said the soldier."
"""As you whistle so I come,"" answered the eagle. So he asked her if she knew any means by which he could get away from the world in which they were."
"""You can't get away from here unless you can fly,"" said the eagle, ""but if you will slaughter twelve oxen for me, so that I can have a really good meal, I will try and help you. Have you got a knife?"""
"""No, but I have a sword,"" he said. When the eagle had swallowed the twelve oxen she asked the soldier to kill one more for victuals on the journey. ""Every time I gape you must be quick and fling a piece into my mouth,"" she said, ""else I shall not be able to carry you up to earth."""
"He did as she asked him and hung two large bags of meat round her neck and seated himself among her feathers. The eagle then began to flap her wings and off they went through the air like the wind. It was as much as the soldier could do to hold on, and it was with the greatest difficulty he managed to throw the pieces of flesh into the eagle's mouth every time she opened it."
"At last the day began to dawn, and the eagle was then almost exhausted and began flapping with her wings, but the soldier was prepared and seized the last hind quarter and flung it to her. Then she gained strength and brought him up to earth. When she had sat and rested a while at the top of a large pine-tree she set off with him again at such a pace that flashes of lightning were seen both by sea and land wherever they went."
"Close to the palace the soldier got off and the eagle flew home again, but first she told him that if he at any time should want her he need only blow the whistle and she would be there at once."
"In the meantime everything was ready at the palace, and the time approached when the captain and lieutenant were to be married with the two eldest Princesses, who, however, were not much happier than their youngest sister; scarcely a day passed without weeping and mourning, and the nearer the wedding-day approached the more sorrowful did they become."
"At last the King asked what was the matter with them; he thought it was very strange that they were not merry and happy now that they were saved and had been set free and were going to be married. They had to give some answer, and so the eldest sister said they never would be happy any more unless they could get such checkers as they had played with in the blue mountain."
"That, thought the King, could be easily managed, and so he sent word to all the best and cleverest goldsmiths in the country that they should make these checkers for the Princesses. For all they tried there was no one who could make them. At last all the goldsmiths had been to the palace except one, and he was an old, infirm man who had not done any work for many years except odd jobs, by which he was just able to keep himself alive. To him the soldier went and asked to be apprenticed. The old man was so glad to get him, for he had not had an apprentice for many a day, that he brought out a flask from his chest and sat down to drink with the soldier. Before long the drink got into his head, and when the soldier saw this he persuaded him to go up to the palace and tell the King that he would undertake to make the checkers for the Princesses."
"He was ready to do that on the spot; he had made finer and grander things in his day, he said. When the King heard there was some one outside who could make the checkers he was not long in coming out."
"""Is it true what you say, that you can make such checkers as my daughters want?"" he asked."
"""Yes, it is no lie,"" said the goldsmith; that he would answer for."
"""That's well!"" said the King. ""Here is the gold to make them with; but if you do not succeed you will lose your life, since you have come and offered yourself, and they must be finished in three days."""
"The next morning when the goldsmith had slept off the effects of the drink, he was not quite so confident about the job. He wailed and wept and blew up his apprentice, who had got him into such a scrape while he was drunk. The best thing would be to make short work of himself at once, he said, for there could be no hope for his life; when the best and grandest goldsmiths could not make such checkers, was it likely that he could do it?"
"""Don't fret on that account,"" said the soldier, ""but let me have the gold and I'll get the checkers ready in time; but I must have a room to myself to work in,"" he said. This he got, and thanks into the bargain."
"The time wore on, and the soldier did nothing but lounge about, and the goldsmith began to grumble, because he would not begin with the work."
"""Don't worry yourself about it,"" said the soldier, ""there is plenty of time! If you are not satisfied with what I have promised you had better make them yourself."" The same thing went on both that day and the next; and when the smith heard neither hammer nor file from the soldier's room the whole of the last day, he quite gave himself up for lost; it was now no use to think any longer about saving his life, he thought."
But when the night came on the soldier opened the window and blew his whistle. The eagle then came and asked what he wanted.
"""Those gold checkers, which the Princesses had in the blue mountain,"" said the soldier; ""but you'll want something to eat first, I suppose? I have two ox carcases lying ready for you in the hay-loft yonder; you had better finish them,"" he said. When the eagle had done she did not tarry, and long before the sun rose she was back again with the checkers. The soldier then put them under his bed and lay down to sleep."
Early next morning the goldsmith came and knocked at his door.
"""What are you after now again?"" asked the soldier. ""You rush about enough in the day, goodness knows! If one cannot have peace when one is in bed, whoever would be an apprentice here?"" said he."
"Neither praying nor begging helped that time; the goldsmith must and would come in, and at last he was let in."
"And then, you may be sure, there was soon an end to his wailing."
"But still more glad than the goldsmith were the Princesses, when he came up to the palace with the checkers, and gladdest of all was the youngest Princess."
"""Have you made them yourself?"" she asked."
"""No, if I must speak the truth, it is not I,"" he said, ""but my apprentice, who has made them."""
"""I should like to see that apprentice,"" said the Princess. In fact all three wanted to see him, and if he valued his life, he would have to come."
"He was not afraid, either of women-folk or grand-folk, said the soldier, and if it could be any amusement to them to look at his rags, they should soon have that pleasure."
"The youngest Princess recognised him at once; she pushed the soldiers aside and ran up to him, gave him her hand, and said:"
"""Good day, and many thanks for all you have done for us. It is he who freed us from the trolls in the mountain,"" she said to the King. ""He is the one I will have!"" and then she pulled off his cap and showed them the ring she had tied in his hair."
"It soon came out how the captain and lieutenant had behaved, and so they had to pay the penalty of their treachery with their lives, and that was the end of their grandeur. But the soldier got the golden crown and half the kingdom, and married the youngest Princess."
"""Heaven bless and help us! what a stout heart you have got!"" said the old dame. ""Don't you see we have got amongst Trolls?"""
"""Stuff and nonsense!"" said the lad; ""no harm if we have."""
"In a little while, back came the man with an ox so fat and big, the lad had never seen its like, and he gave it one blow with his fist under the ear, and down it fell dead on the floor. When that was done, he took it up by all the four legs and laid it on the glowing embers, and turned it and twisted it about till it was burnt brown outside."
"After that, he went to a cupboard and took out a great silver dish, and laid the ox on it; and the dish was so big that none of the ox hung over on any side. This he put on the table, and then he went down into the cellar and fetched a cask of wine, knocked out the head, and put the cask on the table, together with two knives, which were each six feet long. When this was done he bade them go and sit down to supper and eat. So they went, the lad first and the old dame after, but she began to whimper and wail, and to wonder how she should ever use such knives. But her son seized one, and began to cut slices out of the thigh of the ox, which he placed before his mother. And when they had eaten a bit, he took up the cask with both hands, and lifted it down to the floor; then he told his mother to come and drink, but it was still so high she couldn't reach up to it; so he caught her up, and held her up to the edge of the cask while she drank; as for himself, he clambered up and hung down like a cat inside the cask while he drank. So when he had quenched his thirst, he took up the cask and put it back on the table, and thanked the man for the good meal, and told his mother to come and thank him too, and, a-feared though she was, she dared do nothing else but thank the man. Then the lad sat down again alongside the man and began to gossip, and after they had sat a while the man said:"
"""Well! I must just go and get a bit of supper too;"" and so he went to the table and ate up the whole ox hoofs, and horns, and all and drained the cask to the last drop, and then went back and sat on the bench."
"""As for beds,"" he said, ""I don't know what's to be done. I've only got one bed and a cradle; but we could get on pretty well if you would sleep in the cradle, and then your mother might lie in the bed yonder."""
"""Thank you kindly, that'll do nicely,"" said the lad; and with that he pulled off his clothes and lay down in the cradle; but, to tell you the truth, it was quite as big as a four-poster. As for the old dame, she had to follow the man who showed her to bed, though she was out of her wits for fear."
"""Well!"" thought the lad to himself, ""'twill never do to go to sleep yet. I'd best lie awake and listen how things go as the night wears on."""
"So, after a while, the man began to talk to the old dame, and at last he said:"
"""We two might live here so happily together, could we only be rid of this son of yours."""
"""But do you know how to settle him? Is that what you're thinking of?"""
said she.
"""Nothing easier,"" said he; at any rate he would try. He would just say he wished the old dame would stay and keep house for him a day or two, and then he would take the lad out with him up the hill to quarry corner-stones, and roll down a great rock on him. All this the lad lay and listened to."
"Next day the Troll for it was a Troll as clear as day asked if the old dame would stay and keep house for him a few days; and as the day went on he took a great iron crowbar, and asked the lad if he had a mind to go with him up the hill and quarry a few corner-stones. With all his heart, he said, and went with him; and so, after they had split a few stones, the Troll wanted him to go down below and look after cracks in the rock; and while he was doing this the Troll worked away, and wearied himself with his crowbar till he moved a whole crag out of its bed, which came rolling right down on the place where the lad was; but he held it up till he could get on one side, and then let it roll on."
"""Oh!"" said the lad to the Troll, ""now I see what you mean to do with me. You want to crush me to death; so just go down yourself and look after the cracks and refts in the rock, and I'll stand up above."""
"The Troll did not dare to do otherwise than the lad bade him, and the end of it was that the lad rolled down a great rock, which fell upon the Troll and broke one of his thighs."
"""Well! you are in a sad plight,"" said the lad, as he strode down, lifted up the rock, and set the man free. After that he had to put him on his back and carry him home; so he ran with him as fast as a horse, and shook him so that the Troll screamed and screeched as if a knife were run into him. And when he got home, they had to put the Troll to bed, and there he lay in a sad pickle."
"When the night wore on, the Troll began to talk to the old dame again, and to wonder how ever they could be rid of the lad."
"""Well,"" said the old dame, ""if you can't hit on a plan to get rid of him, I'm sure I can't."""
"""Let me see,"" said the Troll; ""I've got twelve lions in a garden; if they could only get hold of the lad, they'd soon tear him to pieces."""
"So the old dame said it would be easy enough to get him there. She would sham sick, and say she felt so poorly, nothing would do her any good but lion's milk. All that the lad lay and listened to; and when he got up in the morning his mother said she was worse than she looked, and she thought she should never be right again unless she could get some lion's milk."
"""Then I'm afraid you'll be poorly a long time, mother,"" said the lad, ""for I'm sure I don't know where any is to be got."""
"""Oh! if that be all,"" said the Troll, ""there's no lack of lion's milk, if we only had the man to fetch it;"" and then he went on to say how his brother had a garden with twelve lions in it, and how the lad might have the key if he had a mind to milk the lions. So the lad took the key and a milking pail, and strode off; and when he unlocked the gate and got into the garden, there stood all the twelve lions on their hind-paws, rampant and roaring at him. But the lad laid hold of the biggest, and led him about by the fore-paws, and dashed him against stocks and stones till there wasn't a bit of him left but the two paws. So when the rest saw that, they were so afraid that they crept up and lay at his feet like so many curs. After that they followed him about wherever he went, and when he got home, they lay down outside the house, with their fore-paws on the door sill."
"""Now, mother, you'll soon be well,"" said the lad, when he went in, ""for here is the lion's milk."""
He had just milked a drop in the pail.
"But the Troll, as he lay in bed, swore it was all a lie. He was sure the lad was not the man to milk lions."
"When the lad heard that, he forced the Troll to get out of bed, threw open the door, and all the lions rose up and seized the Troll, and at last the lad had to make them leave their hold."
"That night the Troll began to talk to the old dame again. ""I'm sure I can't tell how to put this lad out of the way he is so awfully strong; can't you think of some way?"""
"""No,"" said the old dame, ""if you can't tell, I'm sure I can't."""
"""Well!"" said the Troll, ""I have two brothers in a castle; they are twelve times as strong as I am, and that's why I was turned out and had to put up with this farm. They hold that castle, and round it there is an orchard with apples in it, and whoever eats those apples sleeps for three days and three nights. If we could only get the lad to go for the fruit, he wouldn't be able to keep from tasting the apples, and as soon as ever he fell asleep my brothers would tear him in pieces."""
"The old dame said she would sham sick, and say she could never be herself again unless she tasted those apples; for she had set her heart on them."
All this the lad lay and listened to.
"asked the peasant. “Oh, I have not got the money,” replied the woman; “he had happened to forget his money-belt, but he will soon bring it, and he left good security behind him.” “What kind of security?” asked the man. “One of the three cows, which he shall not have until he has paid for the other two. I have managed very cunningly, for I have kept the smallest, which eats the least.” The man was enraged and lifted up his stick, and was just going to give her the beating he had promised her. Suddenly he let the stick fail and said, “You are the stupidest goose that ever waddled on God’s earth, but I am sorry for you. I will go out into the highways and wait for three days to see if I find anyone who is still stupider than you. If I succeed in doing so, you shall go scot-free, but if I do not find him, you shall receive your well-deserved reward without any discount.”"
"He went out into the great highways, sat down on a stone, and waited for what would happen. Then he saw a peasant’s waggon coming towards him, and a woman was standing upright in the middle of it, instead of sitting on the bundle of straw which was lying beside her, or walking near the oxen and leading them. The man thought to himself, “That is certainly one of the kind I am in search of,” and jumped up and ran backwards and forwards in front of the waggon like one who is not very wise. “What do you want, my friend?” said the woman to him; “I don’t know you, where do you come from?” “I have fallen down from heaven,”"
"replied the man, “and don’t know how to get back again, couldn’t you drive me up?” “No,” said the woman, “I don’t know the way, but if you come from heaven you can surely tell me how my husband, who has been there these three years is. You must have seen him?” “Oh, yes, I have seen him, but all men can’t get on well. He keeps sheep, and the sheep give him a great deal to do. They run up the mountains and lose their way in the wilderness, and he has to run after them and drive them together again. His clothes are all torn to pieces too, and will soon fall off his body. There is no tailor there, for Saint Peter won’t let any of them in, as you know by the story.” “Who would have thought it?”"
"cried the woman, “I tell you what, I will fetch his Sunday coat which is still hanging at home in the cupboard, he can wear that and look respectable. You will be so kind as to take it with you.” “That won’t do very well,” answered the peasant; “people are not allowed to take clothes into Heaven, they are taken away from one at the gate.” “Then hark you,” said the woman, “I sold my fine wheat yesterday and got a good lot of money for it, I will send that to him. If you hide the purse in your pocket, no one will know that you have it.” “If you can’t manage it any other way,” said the peasant, “I will do you that favor.”"
"“Just sit still where you are,” said she, “and I will drive home and fetch the purse, I shall soon be back again. I do not sit down on the bundle of straw, but stand up in the waggon, because it makes it lighter for the cattle.” She drove her oxen away, and the peasant thought, “That woman has a perfect talent for folly, if she really brings the money, my wife may think herself fortunate, for she will get no beating.” It was not long before she came in a great hurry with the money, and with her own hands put it in his pocket. Before she went away, she thanked him again a thousand times for his courtesy."
"When the woman got home again, she found her son who had come in from the field. She told him what unlooked-for things had befallen her, and then added, “I am truly delighted at having found an opportunity of sending something to my poor husband. Who would ever have imagined that he could be suffering for want of anything up in heaven?” The son was full of astonishment. “Mother,” said he, “it is not every day that a man comes from Heaven in this way, I will go out immediately, and see if he is still to be found; he must tell me what it is like up there, and how the work is done.” He saddled the horse and rode off with all speed. He found the peasant who was sitting under a willow-tree, and was just going to count the money in the purse. “Have you seen the man who has fallen down from Heaven?” cried the youth to him. “Yes,”"
"answered the peasant, “he has set out on his way back there, and has gone up that hill, from whence it will be rather nearer; you could still catch him up, if you were to ride fast.” “Alas,” said the youth, “I have been doing tiring work all day, and the ride here has completely worn me out; you know the man, be so kind as to get on my horse, and go and persuade him to come here.” “Aha!” thought the peasant, “here is another who has no wick in his lamp!” “Why should I not do you this favor?” said he, and mounted the horse and rode off in a quick trot. The youth remained sitting there till night fell, but the peasant never came back. “The man from Heaven must certainly have been in a great hurry, and would not turn back,” thought he, “and the peasant has no doubt given him the horse to take to my father.” He went home and told his mother what had happened, and that he had sent his father the horse so that he might not have to be always running about."
"“Thou hast done well,” answered she, “thy legs are younger than his, and thou canst go on foot.”"
"When the peasant got home, he put the horse in the stable beside the cow which he had as a pledge, and then went to his wife and said, “Trina, as your luck would have it, I have found two who are still sillier fools than you; this time you escape without a beating, I will store it up for another occasion.” Then he lighted his pipe, sat down in his grandfather’s chair, and said, “It was a good stroke of business to get a sleek horse and a great purse full of money into the bargain, for two lean cows. If stupidity always brought in as much as that, I would be quite willing to hold it in honor.” So thought the peasant, but you no doubt prefer the simple folks."
105 Stories about Snakes
First Story.
"There was once a little child whose mother gave her every afternoon a small bowl of milk and bread, and the child seated herself in the yard with it. When she began to eat however, a snake came creeping out of a crevice in the wall, dipped its little head in the dish, and ate with her. The child had pleasure in this, and when she was sitting there with her little dish and the snake did not come at once, she cried,"
"“Snake, snake, come swiftly Hither come, thou tiny thing, Thou shalt have thy crumbs of bread, Thou shalt refresh thyself with milk.”"
"Then the snake came in haste, and enjoyed its food. Moreover it showed gratitude, for it brought the child all kinds of pretty things from its hidden treasures, bright stones, pearls, and golden playthings. The snake, however, only drank the milk, and left the bread-crumbs alone."
"Then one day the child took its little spoon and struck the snake gently on its head with it, and said, “Eat the bread-crumbs as well, little thing.” The mother, who was standing in the kitchen, heard the child talking to someone, and when she saw that she was striking a snake with her spoon, ran out with a log of wood, and killed the good little creature."
"From that time forth, a change came over the child. As long as the snake had eaten with her, she had grown tall and strong, but now she lost her pretty rosy cheeks and wasted away. It was not long before the funeral bird began to cry in the night, and the redbreast to collect little branches and leaves for a funeral garland, and soon afterwards the child lay on her bier."
Second Story.
"An orphan child was sitting on the town walls spinning, when she saw a snake coming out of a hole low down in the wall. Swiftly she spread out beside this one of the blue silk handkerchiefs which snakes have such a strong liking for, and which are the only things they will creep on. As soon as the snake saw it, it went back, then returned, bringing with it a small golden crown, laid it on the handkerchief, and then went away again. The girl took up the crown, it glittered and was of delicate golden filagree work. It was not long before the snake came back for the second time, but when it no longer saw the crown, it crept up to the wall, and in its grief smote its little head against it as long as it had strength to do so, until at last it lay there dead. If the girl had but left the crown where it was, the snake would certainly have brought still more of its treasures out of the hole."
Third Story.
"A snake cries, “Huhu, huhu.” A child says, “Come out.” The snake comes out, then the child inquires about her little sister: “Hast thou not seen little Red-stockings?” The snake says, “No.” “Neither have I.”"
"“Then I am like you. Huhu, huhu, huhu.”"
106 The Poor Miller’s Boy and the Cat
"In a certain mill lived an old miller who had neither wife nor child, and three apprentices served under him. As they had been with him several years, he one day said to them, “I am old, and want to sit in the chimney-corner, go out, and whichsoever of you brings me the best horse home, to him will I give the mill, and in return for it he shall take care of me till my death.” The third of the boys was, however, the drudge, who was looked on as foolish by the others; they begrudged the mill to him, and afterwards he would not have it. Then all three went out together, and when they came to the village, the two said to stupid Hans, “Thou mayst just as well stay here, as long as thou livest thou wilt never get a horse.” Hans, however, went with them, and when it was night they came to a cave in which they lay down to sleep. The two sharp ones waited until Hans had fallen asleep, then they got up, and went away leaving him where he was. And they thought they had done a very clever thing, but it was certain to turn out ill for them. When the sun arose, and Hans woke up, he was lying in a deep cavern. He looked around on every side and exclaimed, “Oh, heavens, where am I?”"
"Then he got up and clambered out of the cave, went into the forest, and thought, “Here I am quite alone and deserted, how shall I obtain a horse now?” Whilst he was thus walking full of thought, he met a small tabby-cat which said quite kindly, “Hans, where are you going?” “Alas, thou canst not help me.” “I well know your desire,” said the cat. “You wish to have a beautiful horse. Come with me, and be my faithful servant for seven years long, and then I will give you one more beautiful than any you have ever seen in your whole life.” “Well, this is a wonderful cat!” thought Hans, “but I am determined to see if she is telling the truth.” So she took him with her into her enchanted castle, where there were nothing but cats who were her servants. They leapt nimbly upstairs and downstairs, and were merry and happy. In the evening when they sat down to dinner, three of them had to make music."
"One played the bassoon, the other the fiddle, and the third put the trumpet to his lips, and blew out his cheeks as much as he possibly could. When they had dined, the table was carried away, and the cat said, “Now, Hans, come and dance with me.” “No,” said he, “I won’t dance with a pussy cat. I have never done that yet.” “Then take him to bed,” said she to the cats. So one of them lighted him to his bed-room, one pulled his shoes off, one his stockings, and at last one of them blew out the candle. Next morning they returned and helped him out of bed, one put his stockings on for him, one tied his garters, one brought his shoes, one washed him, and one dried his face with her tail. “That feels very soft!” said Hans. He, however, had to serve the cat, and chop some wood every day, and to do that, he had an axe of silver, and the wedge and saw were of silver and the mallet of copper."
"So he chopped the wood small; stayed there in the house and had good meat and drink, but never saw anyone but the tabby-cat and her servants. Once she said to him, “Go and mow my meadow, and dry the grass,” and gave him a scythe of silver, and a whetstone of gold, but bade him deliver them up again carefully. So Hans went thither, and did what he was bidden, and when he had finished the work, he carried the scythe, whetstone, and hay to the house, and asked if it was not yet time for her to give him his reward. “No,” said the cat, “you must first do something more for me of the same kind. There is timber of silver, carpenter’s axe, square, and everything that is needful, all of silver, with these build me a small house.” Then Hans built the small house, and said that he had now done everything, and still he had no horse. Nevertheless the seven years had gone by with him as if they were six months. The cat asked him if he would like to see her horses?"
"“Yes,” said Hans. Then she opened the door of the small house, and when she had opened it, there stood twelve horses, such horses, so bright and shining, that his heart rejoiced at the sight of them. And now she gave him to eat and drink, and said, “Go home, I will not give thee thy horse away with thee; but in three days’ time I will follow thee and bring it.” So Hans set out, and she showed him the way to the mill. She had, however, never once given him a new coat, and he had been obliged to keep on his dirty old smock-frock, which he had brought with him, and which during the seven years had everywhere become too small for him. When he reached home, the two other apprentices were there again as well, and each of them certainly had brought a horse with him, but one of them was a blind one, and the other lame. They asked Hans where his horse was. “It will follow me in three days’ time.” Then they laughed and said, “Indeed, stupid Hans, where wilt thou get a horse?”"
"“It will be a fine one!” Hans went into the parlour, but the miller said he should not sit down to table, for he was so ragged and torn, that they would all be ashamed of him if any one came in. So they gave him a mouthful of food outside, and at night, when they went to rest, the two others would not let him have a bed, and at last he was forced to creep into the goose-house, and lie down on a little hard straw. In the morning when he awoke, the three days had passed, and a coach came with six horses and they shone so bright that it was delightful to see them! and a servant brought a seventh as well, which was for the poor miller’s boy. And a magnificent princess alighted from the coach and went into the mill, and this princess was the little tabby-cat whom poor Hans had served for seven years. She asked the miller where the miller’s boy and drudge was? Then the miller said, “We cannot have him here in the mill, for he is so ragged; he is lying in the goose-house.”"
Then the King’s daughter said that they were to bring him immediately.
"So they brought him out, and he had to hold his little smock-frock together to cover himself. The servants unpacked splendid garments, and washed him and dressed him, and when that was done, no King could have looked more handsome. Then the maiden desired to see the horses which the other apprentices had brought home with them, and one of them was blind and the other lame. So she ordered the servant to bring the seventh horse, and when the miller saw it, he said that such a horse as that had never yet entered his yard. “And that is for the third miller’s boy,” said she. “Then he must have the mill,” said the miller, but the King’s daughter said that the horse was there, and that he was to keep his mill as well, and took her faithful Hans and set him in the coach, and drove away with him. They first drove to the little house which he had built with the silver tools, and behold it was a great castle, and everything inside it was of silver and gold; and then she married him, and he was rich, so rich that he had enough for all the rest of his life. After this, let no one ever say that anyone who is silly can never become a person of importance."
107 The Two Travellers
"Hill and vale do not come together, but the children of men do, good and bad. In this way a shoemaker and a tailor once met with each other in their travels. The tailor was a handsome little fellow who was always merry and full of enjoyment. He saw the shoemaker coming towards him from the other side, and as he observed by his bag what kind of a trade he plied, he sang a little mocking song to him,"
"And now the magnificent castle belonged to the girl alone. She at first did not know how to reconcile herself to her good fortune. Beautiful dresses were hanging in the wardrobes, the chests were filled with gold or silver, or with pearls and jewels, and she never felt a desire that she was not able to gratify. And soon the fame of the beauty and riches of the maiden went over all the world. Wooers presented themselves daily, but none pleased her. At length the son of the King came and he knew how to touch her heart, and she betrothed herself to him. In the garden of the castle was a lime-tree, under which they were one day sitting together, when he said to her, “I will go home and obtain my father’s consent to our marriage. I entreat thee to wait for me here under this lime-tree, I shall be back with thee in a few hours.” The maiden kissed him on his left cheek, and said, “Keep true to me, and never let any one else kiss thee on this cheek. I will wait here under the lime-tree until thou returnest.”"
"The maid stayed beneath the lime-tree until sunset, but he did not return. She sat three days from morning till evening, waiting for him, but in vain. As he still was not there by the fourth day, she said, “Some accident has assuredly befallen him. I will go out and seek him, and will not come back until I have found him.” She packed up three of her most beautiful dresses, one embroidered with bright stars, the second with silver moons, the third with golden suns, tied up a handful of jewels in her handkerchief, and set out. She inquired everywhere for her betrothed, but no one had seen him; no one knew anything about him."
"Far and wide did she wander through the world, but she found him not."
"At last she hired herself to a farmer as a cow-herd, and buried her dresses and jewels beneath a stone."
"And now she lived as a herdswoman, guarded her herd, and was very sad and full of longing for her beloved one; she had a little calf which she taught to know her, and fed it out of her own hand, and when she said,"
"“Little calf, little calf, kneel by my side, And do not forget thy shepherd-maid, As the prince forgot his betrothed bride, Who waited for him ’neath the lime-tree’s shade.”"
"the little calf knelt down, and she stroked it."
"And when she had lived for a couple of years alone and full of grief, a report was spread over all the land that the King’s daughter was about to celebrate her marriage. The road to the town passed through the village where the maiden was living, and it came to pass that once when the maiden was driving out her herd, her bridegroom travelled by. He was sitting proudly on his horse, and never looked round, but when she saw him she recognized her beloved, and it was just as if a sharp knife had pierced her heart. “Alas!” said she, “I believed him true to me, but he has forgotten me.”"
"Next day he again came along the road. When he was near her she said to the little calf,"
"“Little calf, little calf, kneel by my side, And do not forget thy shepherd-maid, As the prince forgot his betrothed bride, Who waited for him ’neath the lime-tree’s shade.”"
"When he was aware of the voice, he looked down and reined in his horse."
"He looked into the herd’s face, and then put his hands before his eyes as if he were trying to remember something, but he soon rode onwards and was out of sight. “Alas!” said she, “he no longer knows me,” and her grief was ever greater."
"Soon after this a great festival three days long was to be held at the King’s court, and the whole country was invited to it."
"“Now will I try my last chance,” thought the maiden, and when evening came she went to the stone under which she had buried her treasures."
"She took out the dress with the golden suns, put it on, and adorned herself with the jewels. She let down her hair, which she had concealed under a handkerchief, and it fell down in long curls about her, and thus she went into the town, and in the darkness was observed by no one. When she entered the brightly-lighted hall, every one started back in amazement, but no one knew who she was. The King’s son went to meet her, but he did not recognize her. He led her out to dance, and was so enchanted with her beauty, that he thought no more of the other bride."
"When the feast was over, she vanished in the crowd, and hastened before daybreak to the village, where she once more put on her herd’s dress."
"Next evening she took out the dress with the silver moons, and put a half-moon made of precious stones in her hair. When she appeared at the festival, all eyes were turned upon her, but the King’s son hastened to meet her, and filled with love for her, danced with her alone, and no longer so much as glanced at anyone else. Before she went away she was forced to promise him to come again to the festival on the last evening."
"When she appeared for the third time, she wore the star-dress which sparkled at every step she took, and her hair-ribbon and girdle were starred with jewels. The prince had already been waiting for her for a long time, and forced his way up to her. “Do but tell who thou art,”"
"said he, “I feel just as if I had already known thee a long time.”"
"“Dost thou not know what I did when thou leftest me?” Then she stepped up to him, and kissed him on his left cheek, and in a moment it was as if scales fell from his eyes, and he recognized the true bride. “Come,”"
"said he to her, “here I stay no longer,” gave her his hand, and led her down to the carriage. The horses hurried away to the magic castle as if the wind had been harnessed to the carriage. The illuminated windows already shone in the distance. When they drove past the lime-tree, countless glow-worms were swarming about it. It shook its branches, and sent forth their fragrance. On the steps flowers were blooming, and the room echoed with the song of strange birds, but in the hall the entire court was assembled, and the priest was waiting to marry the bridegroom to the true bride."
187 The Hare and the Hedgehog
"This story, my dear young folks, seems to be false, but it really is true, for my grandfather, from whom I have it, used always, when relating it, to say complacently, “It must be true, my son, or else no one could tell it to you.” The story is as follows. One Sunday morning about harvest time, just as the buckwheat was in bloom, the sun was shining brightly in heaven, the east wind was blowing warmly over the stubble-fields, the larks were singing in the air, the bees buzzing among the buckwheat, the people were all going in their Sunday clothes to church, and all creatures were happy, and the hedgehog was happy too."
"The hedgehog, however, was standing by his door with his arms akimbo, enjoying the morning breezes, and slowly trilling a little song to himself, which was neither better nor worse than the songs which hedgehogs are in the habit of singing on a blessed Sunday morning."
"Whilst he was thus singing half aloud to himself, it suddenly occurred to him that, while his wife was washing and drying the children, he might very well take a walk into the field, and see how his turnips were going on. The turnips were, in fact, close beside his house, and he and his family were accustomed to eat them, for which reason he looked upon them as his own. No sooner said than done. The hedgehog shut the house-door behind him, and took the path to the field. He had not gone very far from home, and was just turning round the sloe-bush which stands there outside the field, to go up into the turnip-field, when he observed the hare who had gone out on business of the same kind, namely, to visit his cabbages. When the hedgehog caught sight of the hare, he bade him a friendly good morning. But the hare, who was in his own way a distinguished gentleman, and frightfully haughty, did not return the hedgehog’s greeting, but said to him, assuming at the same time a very contemptuous manner, “How do you happen to be running about here in the field so early in the morning?” “I am taking a walk,” said the hedgehog. “A walk!” said the hare, with a smile. “It seems to me that you might use your legs for a better purpose.” This answer made the hedgehog furiously angry, for he can bear anything but an attack on his legs, just because they are crooked by nature. So now the hedgehog said to the hare, “You seem to imagine that you can do more with your legs than I with mine.” “That is just what I do think,” said the hare."
"“That can be put to the test,” said the hedgehog. “I wager that if we run a race, I will outstrip you.” “That is ridiculous! You with your short legs!” said the hare, “but for my part I am willing, if you have such a monstrous fancy for it. What shall we wager?” “A golden louis-d’or and a bottle of brandy,” said the hedgehog. “Done,” said the hare. “Shake hands on it, and then we may as well come off at once.”"
"“Nay,” said the hedgehog, “there is no such great hurry! I am still fasting, I will go home first, and have a little breakfast. In half-an-hour I will be back again at this place.”"
"Hereupon the hedgehog departed, for the hare was quite satisfied with this. On his way the hedgehog thought to himself, “The hare relies on his long legs, but I will contrive to get the better of him. He may be a great man, but he is a very silly fellow, and he shall pay for what he has said.” So when the hedgehog reached home, he said to his wife, “Wife, dress thyself quickly, thou must go out to the field with me.”"
"“What is going on, then?” said his wife. “I have made a wager with the hare, for a gold louis-d’or and a bottle of brandy. I am to run a race with him, and thou must be present.” “Good heavens, husband,” the wife now cried, “art thou not right in thy mind, hast thou completely lost thy wits? What can make thee want to run a race with the hare?” “Hold thy tongue, woman,” said the hedgehog, “that is my affair. Don’t begin to discuss things which are matters for men. Be off, dress thyself, and come with me.” What could the hedgehog’s wife do? She was forced to obey him, whether she liked it or not."
"So when they had set out on their way together, the hedgehog said to his wife, “Now pay attention to what I am going to say. Look you, I will make the long field our race-course. The hare shall run in one furrow, and I in another, and we will begin to run from the top. Now all that thou hast to do is to place thyself here below in the furrow, and when the hare arrives at the end of the furrow, on the other side of thee, thou must cry out to him, ‘I am here already!’”"
"Then they reached the field, and the hedgehog showed his wife her place, and then walked up the field. When he reached the top, the hare was already there. “Shall we start?” said the hare. “Certainly,” said the hedgehog. “Then both at once.” So saying, each placed himself in his own furrow. The hare counted, “Once, twice, thrice, and away!” and went off like a whirlwind down the field. The hedgehog, however, only ran about three paces, and then he stooped down in the furrow, and stayed quietly where he was. When the hare therefore arrived in full career at the lower end of the field, the hedgehog’s wife met him with the cry, “I am here already!” The hare was shocked and wondered not a little, he thought no other than that it was the hedgehog himself who was calling to him, for the hedgehog’s wife looked just like her husband. The hare, however, thought to himself, “That has not been done fairly,” and cried, “It must be run again, let us have it again.” And once more he went off like the wind in a storm, so that he seemed to fly. But the hedgehog’s wife stayed quietly in her place. So when the hare reached the top of the field, the hedgehog himself cried out to him, “I am here already.” The hare, however, quite beside himself with anger, cried, “It must be run again, we must have it again.” “All right,” answered the hedgehog, “for my part we’ll run as often as you choose.” So the hare ran seventy-three times more, and the hedgehog always held out against him, and every time the hare reached either the top or the bottom, either the hedgehog or his wife said, “I am here already.”"
"At the seventy-fourth time, however, the hare could no longer reach the end. In the middle of the field he fell to the ground, blood streamed out of his mouth, and he lay dead on the spot. But the hedgehog took the louis-d’or which he had won and the bottle of brandy, called his wife out of the furrow, and both went home together in great delight, and if they are not dead, they are living there still."
"The youth went straight to the palace. The princess was already expecting him, and accommodated herself to her destiny. The wedding was solemnized, and now he was king, and lord of all the kingdom. He never told her where he had concealed himself for the third time, and who had helped him, so she believed that he had done everything by his own skill, and she had a great respect for him, for she thought to herself, “He is able to do more than I.”"
192 The Master-Thief
"One day an old man and his wife were sitting in front of a miserable house resting a while from their work. Suddenly a splendid carriage with four black horses came driving up, and a richly-dressed man descended from it. The peasant stood up, went to the great man, and asked what he wanted, and in what way he could be useful to him? The stranger stretched out his hand to the old man, and said, “I want nothing but to enjoy for once a country dish; cook me some potatoes, in the way you always have them, and then I will sit down at your table and eat them with pleasure.” The peasant smiled and said, “You are a count or a prince, or perhaps even a duke; noble gentlemen often have such fancies, but you shall have your wish.” The wife went into the kitchen, and began to wash and rub the potatoes, and to make them into balls, as they are eaten by the country-folks. Whilst she was busy with this work, the peasant said to the stranger, “Come into my garden with me for a while, I have still something to do there.” He had dug some holes in the garden, and now wanted to plant some trees in them. “Have you no children,” asked the stranger, “who could help you with your work?” “No,” answered the peasant, “I had a son, it is true, but it is long since he went out into the world. He was a ne’er-do-well; sharp, and knowing, but he would learn nothing and was full of bad tricks, at last he ran away from me, and since then I have heard nothing of him.”"
"The old man took a young tree, put it in a hole, drove in a post beside it, and when he had shovelled in some earth and had trampled it firmly down, he tied the stem of the tree above, below, and in the middle, fast to the post by a rope of straw. “But tell me,” said the stranger, “why you don’t tie that crooked knotted tree, which is lying in the corner there, bent down almost to the ground, to a post also that it may grow straight, as well as these?” The old man smiled and said, “Sir, you speak according to your knowledge, it is easy to see that you are not familiar with gardening. That tree there is old, and mis-shapen, no one can make it straight now. Trees must be trained while they are young.” “That is how it was with your son,” said the stranger, “if you had trained him while he was still young, he would not have run away; now he too must have grown hard and mis-shapen.”"
"“Truly it is a long time since he went away,” replied the old man, “he must have changed.” “Would you know him again if he were to come to you?” asked the stranger. “Hardly by his face,” replied the peasant, “but he has a mark about him, a birth-mark on his shoulder, that looks like a bean.” When he had said that the stranger pulled off his coat, bared his shoulder, and showed the peasant the bean. “Good God!” cried the old man, “Thou art really my son!” and love for his child stirred in his heart. “But,” he added, “how canst thou be my son, thou hast become a great lord and livest in wealth and luxury? How hast thou contrived to do that?” “Ah, father,” answered the son, “the young tree was bound to no post and has grown crooked, now it is too old, it will never be straight again. How have I got all that? I have become a thief, but do not be alarmed, I am a master-thief. For me there are neither locks nor bolts, whatsoever I desire is mine. Do not imagine that I steal like a common thief, I only take some of the superfluity of the rich. Poor people are safe, I would rather give to them than take anything from them. It is the same with anything which I can have without trouble, cunning and dexterity I never touch it.” “Alas, my son,” said the father, “it still does not please me, a thief is still a thief, I tell thee it will end badly.” He took him to his mother, and when she heard that was her son, she wept for joy, but when he told her that he had become a master-thief, two streams flowed down over her face. At length she said, “Even if he has become a thief, he is still my son, and my eyes have beheld him once more.” They sat down to table, and once again he ate with his parents the wretched food which he had not eaten for so long. The father said, “If our Lord, the count up there in the castle, learns who thou art, and what trade thou followest, he will not take thee in his arms and cradle thee in them as he did when he held thee at the font, but will cause thee to swing from a halter.” “Be easy, father, he will do me no harm, for I understand my trade. I will go to him myself this very day.” When evening drew near, the master-thief seated himself in his carriage, and drove to the castle. The count received him civilly, for he took him for a distinguished man. When, however, the stranger made himself known, the count turned pale and was quite silent for some time. At length he said, “Thou art my godson, and on that account mercy shall take the place of justice, and I will deal leniently with thee. Since thou pridest thyself on being a master-thief, I will put thy art to the proof, but if thou dost not stand the test, thou must marry the rope-maker’s daughter, and the croaking of the raven must be thy music on the occasion.” “Lord count,” answered the master-thief, “Think of three things, as difficult as you like, and if I do not perform your tasks, do with me what you will.” The count reflected for some minutes, and then said, “Well, then, in the first place, thou shalt steal the horse I keep for my own riding, out of the stable; in the next, thou shalt steal the sheet from beneath the bodies of my wife and myself when we are asleep, without our observing it, and the wedding-ring of my wife as well; thirdly and lastly, thou shalt steal away out of the church, the parson and clerk. Mark what I am saying, for thy life depends on it.”"
"The master-thief went to the nearest town; there he bought the clothes of an old peasant woman, and put them on. Then he stained his face brown, and painted wrinkles on it as well, so that no one could have recognized him. Then he filled a small cask with old Hungary wine in which was mixed a powerful sleeping-drink. He put the cask in a basket, which he took on his back, and walked with slow and tottering steps to the count’s castle. It was already dark when he arrived. He sat down on a stone in the court-yard and began to cough, like an asthmatic old woman, and to rub his hands as if he were cold. In front of the door of the stable some soldiers were lying round a fire; one of them observed the woman, and called out to her, “Come nearer, old mother, and warm thyself beside us. After all, thou hast no bed for the night, and must take one where thou canst find it.” The old woman tottered up to them, begged them to lift the basket from her back, and sat down beside them at the fire. “What hast thou got in thy little cask, old lady?” asked one. “A good mouthful of wine,” she answered. “I live by trade, for money and fair words I am quite ready to let you have a glass.” “Let us have it here, then,” said the soldier, and when he had tasted one glass he said, “When wine is good, I like another glass,” and had another poured out for himself, and the rest followed his example. “Hallo, comrades,” cried one of them to those who were in the stable, “here is an old goody who has wine that is as old as herself; take a draught, it will warm your stomachs far better than our fire.” The old woman carried her cask into the stable. One of the soldiers had seated himself on the saddled riding-horse, another held its bridle in his hand, a third had laid hold of its tail. She poured out as much as they wanted until the spring ran dry. It was not long before the bridle fell from the hand of the one, and he fell down and began to snore, the other left hold of the tail, lay down and snored still louder. The one who was sitting in the saddle, did remain sitting, but bent his head almost down to the horse’s neck, and slept and blew with his mouth like the bellows of a forge. The soldiers outside had already been asleep for a long time, and were lying on the ground motionless, as if dead."
"When the master-thief saw that he had succeeded, he gave the first a rope in his hand instead of the bridle, and the other who had been holding the tail, a wisp of straw, but what was he to do with the one who was sitting on the horse’s back? He did not want to throw him down, for he might have awakened and have uttered a cry. He had a good idea, he unbuckled the girths of the saddle, tied a couple of ropes which were hanging to a ring on the wall fast to the saddle, and drew the sleeping rider up into the air on it, then he twisted the rope round the posts, and made it fast. He soon unloosed the horse from the chain, but if he had ridden over the stony pavement of the yard they would have heard the noise in the castle. So he wrapped the horse’s hoofs in old rags, led him carefully out, leapt upon him, and galloped off."
"When day broke, the master galloped to the castle on the stolen horse."
"The count had just got up, and was looking out of the window. “Good morning, Sir Count,” he cried to him, “here is the horse, which I have got safely out of the stable! Just look, how beautifully your soldiers are lying there sleeping; and if you will but go into the stable, you will see how comfortable your watchers have made it for themselves.”"
"The count could not help laughing, then he said, “For once thou hast succeeded, but things won’t go so well the second time, and I warn thee that if thou comest before me as a thief, I will handle thee as I would a thief.” When the countess went to bed that night, she closed her hand with the wedding-ring tightly together, and the count said, “All the doors are locked and bolted, I will keep awake and wait for the thief, but if he gets in by the window, I will shoot him.” The master-thief, however, went in the dark to the gallows, cut a poor sinner who was hanging there down from the halter, and carried him on his back to the castle. Then he set a ladder up to the bedroom, put the dead body on his shoulders, and began to climb up. When he had got so high that the head of the dead man showed at the window, the count, who was watching in his bed, fired a pistol at him, and immediately the master let the poor sinner fall down, and hid himself in one corner. The night was sufficiently lighted by the moon, for the master to see distinctly how the count got out of the window on to the ladder, came down, carried the dead body into the garden, and began to dig a hole in which to lay it. “Now,” thought the thief, “the favourable moment has come,” stole nimbly out of his corner, and climbed up the ladder straight into the countess’s bedroom. “Dear wife,” he began in the count’s voice, “the thief is dead, but, after all, he is my godson, and has been more of a scape-grace than a villain. I will not put him to open shame; besides, I am sorry for the parents. I will bury him myself before daybreak, in the garden that the thing may not be known, so give me the sheet, I will wrap up the body in it, and bury him as a dog burries things by scratching.” The countess gave him the sheet. “I tell you what,”"
"continued the thief, “I have a fit of magnanimity on me, give me the ring too,—the unhappy man risked his life for it, so he may take it with him into his grave.” She would not gainsay the count, and although she did it unwillingly she drew the ring from her finger, and gave it to him. The thief made off with both these things, and reached home safely before the count in the garden had finished his work of burying."
"What a long face the count did pull when the master came next morning, and brought him the sheet and the ring. “Art thou a wizard?” said he, “Who has fetched thee out of the grave in which I myself laid thee, and brought thee to life again?” “You did not bury me,” said the thief, “but the poor sinner on the gallows,” and he told him exactly how everything had happened, and the count was forced to own to him that he was a clever, crafty thief. “But thou hast not reached the end yet,” he added, “thou hast still to perform the third task, and if thou dost not succeed in that, all is of no use.” The master smiled and returned no answer. When night had fallen he went with a long sack on his back, a bundle under his arms, and a lantern in his hand to the village-church."
"In the sack he had some crabs, and in the bundle short wax-candles. He sat down in the churchyard, took out a crab, and stuck a wax-candle on his back. Then he lighted the little light, put the crab on the ground, and let it creep about. He took a second out of the sack, and treated it in the same way, and so on until the last was out of the sack."
"Hereupon he put on a long black garment that looked like a monk’s cowl, and stuck a gray beard on his chin. When at last he was quite unrecognizable, he took the sack in which the crabs had been, went into the church, and ascended the pulpit. The clock in the tower was just striking twelve; when the last stroke had sounded, he cried with a loud and piercing voice, “Hearken, sinful men, the end of all things has come! The last day is at hand! Hearken! Hearken! Whosoever wishes to go to heaven with me must creep into the sack. I am Peter, who opens and shuts the gate of heaven. Behold how the dead outside there in the churchyard, are wandering about collecting their bones. Come, come, and creep into the sack; the world is about to be destroyed!” The cry echoed through the whole village. The parson and clerk who lived nearest to the church, heard it first, and when they saw the lights which were moving about the churchyard, they observed that something unusual was going on, and went into the church. They listened to the sermon for a while, and then the clerk nudged the parson and said, “It would not be amiss if we were to use the opportunity together, and before the dawning of the last day, find an easy way of getting to heaven.” “To tell the truth,” answered the parson, “that is what I myself have been thinking, so if you are inclined, we will set out on our way.” “Yes,” answered the clerk, “but you, the pastor, have the precedence, I will follow.” So the parson went first, and ascended the pulpit where the master opened his sack. The parson crept in first, and then the clerk. The master immediately tied up the sack tightly, seized it by the middle, and dragged it down the pulpit-steps, and whenever the heads of the two fools bumped against the steps, he cried, “We are going over the mountains.” Then he drew them through the village in the same way, and when they were passing through puddles, he cried, “Now we are going through wet clouds.” And when at last he was dragging them up the steps of the castle, he cried, “Now we are on the steps of heaven, and will soon be in the outer court.” When he had got to the top, he pushed the sack into the pigeon-house, and when the pigeons fluttered about, he said, “Hark how glad the angels are, and how they are flapping their wings!” Then he bolted the door upon them, and went away."
"Next morning he went to the count, and told him that he had performed the third task also, and had carried the parson and clerk out of the church. “Where hast thou left them?” asked the lord. “They are lying upstairs in a sack in the pigeon-house, and imagine that they are in heaven.” The count went up himself, and convinced himself that the master had told the truth. When he had delivered the parson and clerk from their captivity, he said, “Thou art an arch-thief, and hast won thy wager. For once thou escapest with a whole skin, but see that thou leavest my land, for if ever thou settest foot on it again, thou may’st count on thy elevation to the gallows.” The arch-thief took leave of his parents, once more went forth into the wide world, and no one has ever heard of him since."
193 The Drummer
"A young drummer went out quite alone one evening into the country, and came to a lake on the shore of which he perceived three pieces of white linen lying. “What fine linen,” said he, and put one piece in his pocket. He returned home, thought no more of what he had found, and went to bed. Just as he was going to sleep, it seemed to him as if some one was saying his name. He listened, and was aware of a soft voice which cried to him, “Drummer, drummer, wake up!” As it was a dark night he could see no one, but it appeared to him that a figure was hovering about his bed. “What do you want?” he asked. “Give me back my dress,”"
"answered the voice, “that you took away from me last evening by the lake.” “You shall have it back again,” said the drummer, “if you will tell me who you are.” “Ah,” replied the voice, “I am the daughter of a mighty King; but I have fallen into the power of a witch, and am shut up on the glass-mountain. I have to bathe in the lake every day with my two sisters, but I cannot fly back again without my dress. My sisters have gone away, but I have been forced to stay behind. I entreat you to give me my dress back.” “Be easy, poor child,” said the drummer. “I will willingly give it back to you.” He took it out of his pocket, and reached it to her in the dark. She snatched it in haste, and wanted to go away with it. “Stop a moment, perhaps I can help you.” “You can only help me by ascending the glass-mountain, and freeing me from the power of the witch. But you cannot come to the glass-mountain, and indeed if you were quite close to it you could not ascend it.” “When I want to do a thing I always can do it,” said the drummer; “I am sorry for you, and have no fear of anything. But I do not know the way which leads to the glass-mountain.” “The road goes through the great forest, in which the man-eaters live,” she answered, “and more than that, I dare not tell you.” And then he heard her wings quiver, as she flew away."
"By daybreak the drummer arose, buckled on his drum, and went without fear straight into the forest. After he had walked for a while without seeing any giants, he thought to himself, “I must waken up the sluggards,” and he hung his drum before him, and beat such a reveille that the birds flew out of the trees with loud cries. It was not long before a giant who had been lying sleeping among the grass, rose up, and was as tall as a fir-tree. “Wretch!” cried he; “what art thou drumming here for, and wakening me out of my best sleep?” “I am drumming,” he replied, “because I want to show the way to many thousands who are following me.” “What do they want in my forest?”"
"demanded the giant. “They want to put an end to thee, and cleanse the forest of such a monster as thou art!” “Oho!” said the giant, “I will trample you all to death like so many ants.” “Dost thou think thou canst do anything against us?” said the drummer; “if thou stoopest to take hold of one, he will jump away and hide himself; but when thou art lying down and sleeping, they will come forth from every thicket, and creep up to thee. Every one of them has a hammer of steel in his belt, and with that they will beat in thy skull.” The giant grew angry and thought, “If I meddle with the crafty folk, it might turn out badly for me. I can strangle wolves and bears, but I cannot protect myself from these earth-worms.” “Listen, little fellow,” said he; “go back again, and I will promise you that for the future I will leave you and your comrades in peace, and if there is anything else you wish for, tell me, for I am quite willing to do something to please you.” “Thou hast long legs,” said the drummer, “and canst run quicker than I; carry me to the glass-mountain, and I will give my followers a signal to go back, and they shall leave thee in peace this time.” “Come here, worm,” said the giant; “seat thyself on my shoulder, I will carry thee where thou wishest to be.” The giant lifted him up, and the drummer began to beat his drum up aloft to his heart’s delight. The giant thought, “That is the signal for the other people to turn back.”"
"After a while, a second giant was standing in the road, who took the drummer from the first, and stuck him in his button-hole. The drummer laid hold of the button, which was as large as a dish, held on by it, and looked merrily around. Then they came to a third giant, who took him out of the button-hole, and set him on the rim of his hat. Then the drummer walked backwards and forwards up above, and looked over the trees, and when he perceived a mountain in the blue distance, he thought, “That must be the glass-mountain,” and so it was. The giant only made two steps more, and they reached the foot of the mountain, where the giant put him down. The drummer demanded to be put on the summit of the glass-mountain, but the giant shook his head, growled something in his beard, and went back into the forest."
"And now the poor drummer was standing before the mountain, which was as high as if three mountains were piled on each other, and at the same time as smooth as a looking-glass, and did not know how to get up it."
"He began to climb, but that was useless, for he always slipped back again. “If one was a bird now,” thought he; but what was the good of wishing, no wings grew for him."
"Whilst he was standing thus, not knowing what to do, he saw, not far from him, two men who were struggling fiercely together. He went up to them and saw that they were disputing about a saddle which was lying on the ground before them, and which both of them wanted to have. “What fools you are,” said he, “to quarrel about a saddle, when you have not a horse for it!” “The saddle is worth fighting about,” answered one of the men; “whosoever sits on it, and wishes himself in any place, even if it should be the very end of the earth, gets there the instant he has uttered the wish. The saddle belongs to us in common. It is my turn to ride on it, but that other man will not let me do it.” “I will soon decide the quarrel,” said the drummer, and he went to a short distance and stuck a white rod in the ground. Then he came back and said, “Now run to the goal, and whoever gets there first, shall ride first.” Both put themselves into a trot; but hardly had they gone a couple of steps before the drummer swung himself on the saddle, wished himself on the glass-mountain, and before any one could turn round, he was there. On the top of the mountain was a plain; there stood an old stone house, and in front of the house lay a great fish-pond, but behind it was a dark forest. He saw neither men nor animals, everything was quiet; only the wind rustled amongst the trees, and the clouds moved by quite close above his head. He went to the door and knocked. When he had knocked for the third time, an old woman with a brown face and red eyes opened the door. She had spectacles on her long nose, and looked sharply at him; then she asked what he wanted. “Entrance, food, and a bed for the night,” replied the drummer. “That thou shalt have,” said the old woman, “if thou wilt perform three services in return.” “Why not?” he answered, “I am not afraid of any kind of work, however hard it may be.” The old woman let him go in, and gave him some food and a good bed at night. The next morning when he had had his sleep out, she took a thimble from her wrinkled finger, reached it to the drummer, and said, “Go to work now, and empty out the pond with this thimble; but thou must have it done before night, and must have sought out all the fishes which are in the water and laid them side by side, according to their kind and size.” “That is strange work,” said the drummer, but he went to the pond, and began to empty it. He baled the whole morning; but what can any one do to a great lake with a thimble, even if he were to bale for a thousand years?"
"When it was noon, he thought, “It is all useless, and whether I work or not it will come to the same thing.” So he gave it up and sat down."
"Then came a maiden out of the house who set a little basket with food before him, and said, “What ails thee, that thou sittest so sadly here?” He looked at her, and saw that she was wondrously beautiful."
"“Ah,” said he, “I cannot finish the first piece of work, how will it be with the others? I came forth to seek a king’s daughter who is said to dwell here, but I have not found her, and I will go farther.” “Stay here,” said the maiden, “I will help thee out of thy difficulty. Thou art tired, lay thy head in my lap, and sleep. When thou awakest again, thy work will be done.” The drummer did not need to be told that twice."
"As soon as his eyes were shut, she turned a wishing-ring and said, “Rise, water. Fishes, come out.” Instantly the water rose on high like a white mist, and moved away with the other clouds, and the fishes sprang on the shore and laid themselves side by side each according to his size and kind. When the drummer awoke, he saw with amazement that all was done. But the maiden said, “One of the fish is not lying with those of its own kind, but quite alone; when the old woman comes to-night and sees that all she demanded has been done, she will ask thee, ‘What is this fish lying alone for?’ Then throw the fish in her face, and say, ‘This one shall be for thee, old witch.’” In the evening the witch came, and when she had put this question, he threw the fish in her face. She behaved as if she did not remark it, and said nothing, but looked at him with malicious eyes. Next morning she said, “Yesterday it was too easy for thee, I must give thee harder work."
"To-day thou must hew down the whole of the forest, split the wood into logs, and pile them up, and everything must be finished by the evening.” She gave him an axe, a mallet, and two wedges. But the axe was made of lead, and the mallet and wedges were of tin. When he began to cut, the edge of the axe turned back, and the mallet and wedges were beaten out of shape. He did not know how to manage, but at mid-day the maiden came once more with his dinner and comforted him. “Lay thy head on my lap,” said she, “and sleep; when thou awakest, thy work will be done.” She turned her wishing-ring, and in an instant the whole forest fell down with a crash, the wood split, and arranged itself in heaps, and it seemed just as if unseen giants were finishing the work. When he awoke, the maiden said, “Dost thou see that the wood is piled up and arranged, one bough alone remains; but when the old woman comes this evening and asks thee about that bough, give her a blow with it, and say, ‘That is for thee, thou witch.’”"
"The old woman came, “There thou seest how easy the work was!” said she; “but for whom hast thou left that bough which is lying there still?”"
"“For thee, thou witch,” he replied, and gave her a blow with it. But she pretended not to feel it, laughed scornfully, and said, “Early to-morrow morning thou shalt arrange all the wood in one heap, set fire to it, and burn it.” He rose at break of day, and began to pick up the wood, but how can a single man get a whole forest together? The work made no progress. The maiden, however, did not desert him in his need."
"She brought him his food at noon, and when he had eaten, he laid his head on her lap, and went to sleep. When he awoke, the entire pile of wood was burning in one enormous flame, which stretched its tongues out into the sky. “Listen to me,” said the maiden, “when the witch comes, she will give thee all kinds of orders; do whatever she asks thee without fear, and then she will not be able to get the better of thee, but if thou art afraid, the fire will lay hold of thee, and consume thee. At last when thou hast done everything, seize her with both thy hands, and throw her into the midst of the fire.” The maiden departed, and the old woman came sneaking up to him. “Oh, I am cold,” said she, “but that is a fire that burns; it warms my old bones for me, and does me good! But there is a log lying there which won’t burn, bring it out for me. When thou hast done that, thou art free, and mayst go where thou likest, come; go in with a good will.”"

"versions, the explanation of which would require a much greater"
knowledge of German hymnody than the author possesses. An effort has
been made to bring the spelling into conformity with the modern German
practice of omitting the “h” where it was formerly used with the “th”;
the use of “ss” instead of “sz”; and printing the initial letter of the
"pronouns referring to Deity, in lower case rather than with capitals."

"White flashes dance along the deep,"
That moans as if uneasily
It turned in an unquiet sleep.
Ridge after rocky ridge upheaves
A toppling crest that falls in spray
Where the tormented beach receives
The buffets of the sea’s wild play.

"Where the sky rests, a visible wall."

The sails that fly before the squall.
UNDER THE CLIFFS.
BRIGHT light to windward on the horizon’s verge;
"To leeward, stormy shadows, violet-black,"
And the wide sea between
A vast unfurrowed field of windless green;
The stormy shadows flicker on the track
Of phantom sails that vanish and emerge.

"I watch the white sun walk across the sea,"
I seem to half surprise
In the evasions of those eyes.

Quogge Myre stared at his little disciple with contempt; a sneer played
about his puffy lip--became too tense for silence:
"“This man repeats what I say--what I _used_ to say--like flattery,” he"
said.
Lovegood smiled grimly:
"“Oh,” said he--“_he_ stays in Paris sometimes now. And there are the"
French newspapers.”
Myre shrugged his shoulders:
“I have changed all my ideas on these subjects----”
But the ridiculous figure of Ffolliott strolled nervously up to the
"group, and interrupting the critical vapourings of Quogge Myre, he said"
with affected drawl:
"“D’you know, I feel such an awful ass--and I don’t get used to it.”"
Lovegood gazed at him solemnly:
"“Young fellow,” said he--“you must not be egotistical--it’s bad for the"
morals. Try and forget yourself in that disguise.”

THE LAST EXIT.
"OUR love was all arrayed in pleasantness,"
A tender little love that sighed and smiled
"At little happy nothings, like a child,"
A dainty little love in fancy dress.
But now the love that once was half in play
Has come to be this grave and piteous thing.
Why did you leave me all this suffering
For all your memory when you went away?
"You might have played the play out, O my friend,"
Closing upon a kiss our comedy.
"Or is it, then, a fault of taste in me,"
Who like no tragic exit at the end?
Myre went suddenly dumb....
"Sir Gilders Persimmon had shuffled over to Fosse, who was wetting his"
"lips, eager to leap into the debate, when Myre’s yawing should give"
"opportunity, and, button-holing the fussy little man, the deaf old"
gentleman asked him:
"“You said, sir, that the reformed rake did what?”"
"“No, Sir Gilders--I said that the man who does not play whist is laying"
up a sad old age----”
The old gentleman poked him slyly in the lean ribs:
"“Makes the best husband, eh! Indeed, yes--very likely--very likely. But"
it’s dangerous doctrine--it’s----”
"“No, Sir Gilders,” shrieked the perspiring little man--“I say the man"
"who does not play _whist_.” He coughed--his voice breaking. “Oh, damn"
"this old gentleman!” he added, moving irritably away from him...."
Quogge Myre turned to Pangbutt:
"“Now, Pangbutt, mind you, I don’t say that this Anthony Bickersteth is"
a Balzac; but he has the true genius for literature. How can you define
"these things? It is there, or it is not there!”"
Fosse skipped up to the group:
“What _I_ say--what _I_ say----”
"Leaning across the table, over the beer,"
"While the music maddened the whirling skirts of the ball,"
"As the midnight hour drew near,"
"There with the women, haggard, painted and old,"
"One fresh bud in a garland withered and stale,"
"She, with her innocent voice and her clear eyes, told"
Tale after shameless tale.
"And ever the witching smile, to her face beguiled,"
"Paused and broadened, and broke in a ripple of fun,"
"And the soul of a child looked out of the eyes of a child,"
Or ever the tale was done.
"O my child, who wronged you first, and began"
First the dance of death that you dance so well?
Soul for soul: and I think the soul of a man
Shall answer for yours in hell.

waking life. It may be worth while to bring forward a few dreams which
incidentally illustrate the moral attitude of the dreamer.
A lady narrated the following dream immediately on awakening: 'I had
murdered a woman from some moral or political motive--I forget what--and
had come in great agony to my husband with her shoes and watch-chain. He
"promised to help me, and while I was wondering what could be done for"
"the benefit of the woman's family, some one came in and announced that a"
"lecture was about to be given on the beauty of nakedness. I then went,"
with several prim and respectable ladies of my acquaintance [the names
"were given], into a crowded hall. The lecturer who--so far as appearance"
"is concerned--was a well-known Member of Parliament, then entered and"
"gave a most eloquent address on Whitman, nakedness, ugly figures, etc."
He especially emphasised the fact that the reason people are shocked at
nakedness is that they usually only see unbeautiful bodies which repel
"them because they are unlike their ideals. Then he put out his hand, and"
"“You are bothering me and preventing me from drinking my coffee,” he"
"said, with exquisite politeness, and touched the bell."
"“Be careful!” exclaimed the monk, seizing Cæsar’s arm with violence."
"“Don’t you touch me again,” said Cæsar, pulling away violently, his"
"face pale and his eyes flashing. “If you do, I have a revolver here with"
"five chambers, and I shall take pleasure in emptying them one by one,"
"taking that lighthouse you carry about for a nose, as my target.”"
“Fire it if you dare.”
Fortunately the waiter had come in on hearing the bell.
"“Do you wish anything, sir?” he asked."
"“Yes, please escort this clerical gentleman to the door, and tell him on"
the way not to come back here.”
Days later Cæsar found out that there had been a great disturbance at
the Altemps palace in consequence of the calls he had made. Preciozi
"had been punished and sent away from Rome, and the various Spanish"
monasteries and colleges warned not to receive Cæsar.

CHAPTER XV
THE LAW--AND THE PROFITS
Sallie saw how Jasper Slyne's face blanched at sight of that very
"untimely intruder, whose keen eyes seemed to take in the situation there"
at a glance.
"Mr. Jobling had fallen backward into a convenient armchair and, with"
"both hands clapped to his nose, was moaning most piteously. Captain Dove"
"was standing over him, with features inflamed, in a very bellicose"
"posture and glaring at the new-comer, toward whom Slyne had turned"
inquiringly.
"""You're--looking for some one, M. Dubois?"" Slyne asked, in a tone of"
"polite surprise, which, Sallie knew, was assumed."
"""A thousand pardons,"" returned that individual. ""I am indeed looking for"
"some one--whom I thought to find here. I had no intention, however, of"
"intruding upon a lady--"" He bowed profusely to Sallie. ""It may be,"" he"
"suggested, ""that I have mistaken the number. Is not this the suite 161?"""

"""Eleven dead, sixty-four injured,"" the purser answered mechanically."
"""And no more army stationed south of Icebox."" His right ear twitched"
"irritably. ""But what're they saying?"""
"Suddenly we heard. ""By authority vested in me under the Pomona College"

We all waited breathlessly for Butt's reply. The seconds ambled on and
"there was no clatter of electrostatic discharge, no smell of burning"
flesh.
Then we heard some feet walking. A big man in a green suit swung out
"into the crossway. That was Butt. Behind him came the Captain, holding"
"the blaster gingerly with both hands. Butt had a funny, thoughtful look"
"to have been particularly active in helping to take a Dutch merchantman,"
"the _Gertruycht_. Hanged in chains at Cape Coast Castle in April, 1722, at"
the age of 23.
"SWAN, CAPTAIN."
"Commanded the _Nicholas_, and met Dampier when in the _Batchelor's"
Delight_ at the Island of Juan Fernandez in 1684. The two captains cruised
"together off the west coast of South America, the _Nicholas_ leaving"
"Dampier, who returned to England by way of the East Indies."
"SWAN, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer."
Of the _Cygnet_. Left England as an honest trader. Rounded the Horn and
"sailed up to the Bay of Nicoya, there taking on a crew of buccaneers who"
had crossed the Isthmus of Darien on foot. Dampier was appointed pilot or
"quartermaster to the _Cygnet_, a post analogous to that of a navigating"
"officer on a modern man-of-war, while Ringrose was appointed supercargo."
"Swan had an adventurous and chequered voyage, sometimes meeting with"
"successes, but often with reverses. Eventually he sailed to the Philippine"
"Islands, where the crew mutinied and left Swan and thirty-six of the crew"
"behind. After various adventures the _Cygnet_, by now in a very crazy"
"state, just managed to reach Madagascar, where she sank at her anchorage."

8. Psalm Versions.
"The use of the psalms in singing, first on the Continent, then in"
"England and Scotland, and later in America, brought forth many metrical"
"versions of the psalter, the principal ones being the following:"
"a. _The Genevan Psalter_, begun 1539, published complete in 1562. It was"
"made at the request of John Calvin by Clément Marot, court poet of"
"France, and Theodore Beza, a French scholar. It became the psalm book"
"for the Reformation churches on the continent, and is spoken of as the"
most famous book of praise the Christian Church ever produced. It was
issued in at least one thousand editions and translated into a number of
"tongues. Some of the original tunes are still in use, e.g., “Old"
Hundredth.”
"b. _The Anglo-Genevan Psalter_, Geneva, 1556. This was used by John"
"Knox, the Scottish reformer, and his followers who fled the persecutions"
"of “Bloody Mary,” and formed a congregation at Geneva. The book"
incorporated some of the Sternhold and Hopkins versions which were in
"use in England, and added others."
"c. _The Old Version_, Sternhold and Hopkins, completed in 1562. Used in"
"England for 134 years. It is entitled, _The Whole Booke of Psalmes_, but"
"Spriggs's part, for as he was sailing off the west end of Cuba he again"
met the man-of-war which had so nearly caught him before in the bay.
"Spriggs clapped on all sail, but ran his ship on Rattan Island, where she"
"was burnt by the _Spence_, while Captain Spriggs and his crew escaped to"
the woods.
"SPRINGER, CAPTAIN."
He fought gallantly with Sawkins and Ringrose in the Battle of Perico off
"Panama on St. George's Day in 1680. He gave his name to Springer's Cay,"
one of the Samballoes Islands. This was the rendezvous chosen by the
"pirates, where Dampier and his party found the French pirate ship that"
rescued them after their famous trudge across the Isthmus of Darien.
"STANLEY, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer."
With a few other buccaneers in their stronghold at New Providence Island
"in 1660, withstood an attack by a Spanish fleet for five days. The three"
"English captains, Stanley, Sir Thomas Whetstone, and Major Smith, were"
carried to Panama and there cast into a dungeon and bound in irons for
seventeen months.
"STEDMAN, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer."
"In 1666, with Captain Searle and a party of only eighty men, he took and"
"plundered the Dutch island of Tobago. Later on, after the outbreak of war"
"with France, he was captured by a French frigate off the Island of"
"Guadeloupe. Stedman had a small vessel and a crew of only 100 men, and"
"found himself becalmed and unable to escape, so he boldly boarded the"
"HE stands, a patient figure, where the crowd"
Heaves to and fro beside him. In his ears
"All day the Fair goes thundering, and he hears"
"In darkness, as a dead man in his shroud."
"Patient he stands, with age and sorrow bowed,"
And holds a piteous hat of ancient yean;
And in his face and gesture there appears
The desperate humbleness of poor men proud.
"What thoughts are his, as, with the inward sight,"
He sees those mirthful faces pass him by?
Is the long darkness darker for that light.
The misery deeper when that joy is nigh?
"Patient, alone, he stands from morn to night,"
Pleading in his reproachful misery.
THE OLD LABOURER.
"HIS fourscore years have bent a back of oak,"
His earth-brown cheeks are full of hollow pits;
His gnarled hands wander idly as he sits
Bending above the hearthstone’s feeble smoke.
Threescore and ten slow years he tilled the land;
He wrung his bread from out the stubborn soil;
He saw his masters flourish through his toil;
He held their substance in his horny hand.
"instant death to the Spanish guards if they cried out, then cut the cables"
and sailed out of the bay. As soon as it was light the Spanish ship
"commenced a furious bombardment of Rackam's empty vessel, thinking he was"
still aboard her.
"In the summer of 1720 he took numbers of small vessels and fishing boats,"
"but nothing very rich, and was not above stealing the fishermen's nets and"
landing and taking cattle. In October Rackam was chased near Nigril Bay by
a Government sloop commanded by a Captain Barret. After a short fight
"Rackam surrendered, and was carried a prisoner to Port Royal."
"On November 16th Rackam and his crew were tried at St. Jago de la Vega,"
convicted and sentenced to death. Amongst the crew were two women dressed
"as men, Anne Bonny and Mary Read. The former was married, in pirate"
"fashion, to Rackam."
"On the morning of his execution Rackam was allowed, as a special favour,"
"to visit his Anne, but all the comfort he got from her was ""that she was"
"sorry to see him there, but if he had fought like a man, he need not have"
"been hanged like a Dog."""
"Rackam was hanged on November 17th, 1720, at Gallows Point, at Port Royal,"
Jamaica.
"RAPHAELINA, CAPTAIN."
Much dreaded by the merchant sailors navigating the South Atlantic. In
1822 he controlled a fleet of pirate vessels in the vicinity of Cape
Antonio.
"forthcoming he would cut the throats of all his prisoners, many of them"
"the leading merchants of the town. While waiting for the Governor's reply,"
Richards and his companions scandalized the towns-folk of Charleston by
their outrageous and swaggering conduct.
"RICHARDSON, JOHN."
"His father was a goldsmith at New York. John, tiring of the trade of"
"cooper, to which he was apprenticed, ran away to sea. For many years he"
served both in men-of-war and in merchant ships. Although an unmitigated
"blackguard, he did not commit piracy nor murder until some years later,"
"when, being at Ancona, he met a Captain Benjamin Hartley, who had come"
there with a loading of pilchards. Richardson was taken on board to serve
"as ship's carpenter, and sailed for Leghorn. With another sailor called"
"Coyle, Richardson concocted a mutiny, murdered the captain in the most"
"brutal manner, and was appointed mate in the pirate ship. As a pirate"
Richardson was beneath contempt. His life ended on the gallows at
"Execution Dock on January 25th, 1738."
"RICHARDSON, NICHOLAS."
"One of Captain Quelch's crew. Taken out of the brigantine _Charles_, and"
tried for piracy at Boston in 1704.
"RIDGE, JOHN."
Of London.
"One of Major Stede Bonnet's crew. Hanged in 1718 at Charleston, South"
"But fortunately for women, Infidels are more numerous than they ever"
"were before, and the power of the Church is dying of dry rot, or as Col."
"Ingersoll wittily says, of the combined influence of softening of the"
brain and ossification of the heart.

"being dismissed, I whistled long."
Naughty old gentleman!...
The next morning Pa did not return. Mid-day passed. Evening stole
on.... The dusk saw me descend at the doors of the address in St.
John’s Wood from mine hansom cab.
"I must preach the decencies; thus I, strengthening the intention as I"
rang.
"‘Sir Pompey Malahide is here,’ said I sternly to the smart maid that"
opened the door.
"‘Yes, sir,’ said she."
"‘I desire to see my father,’ said I, and marched boldly towards the"
furious racket that filled the room near at hand--the paternal roar
"distinctly discernible, bassoonlike as though he cried small coal."
I flung open the door--burst upon the riot----
On the floor lay the Byronic Bartholomew Doome with three children
"rolling over him--three, no less!--another in his arms--Sir Pompey"
"Malahide, my father, on all fours, pretending to be a she-bear, his"
"coat-tails over his head, shaking a footstool in his teeth, and"
growling like an ass in pain--and seated on the immaculate waistcoat of
the dark mysterious Bartholomew the most beautiful young woman I have
ever seen. The din infernal--and Pa the worst part of the din.
"screeching gargoyles, instead, devoted all their efforts to merely"
hurling their attenuated bodies on the two men as though they wished
to capture them alive.
"Finally, however, the nature of the battle changed. The tallest of the"
attackers opened his tiny mouth and piped a signal. The ring of
weaving tall bodies surrounding the two opened and became a U. The
"creatures in the curve of the U raised their shock-tubes and, with"
"none of their own kind behind the victims to share in its discharge,"
released whatever power it was that lurked in them.
The shock was terrific. Without the glass and metal of the ship to
"protect them, out in the open and defenceless, Brand and Dex got some"
indication of its real power.
"Writhing and twitching, feeling as though pierced by millions of red"
"hot needles, they went down. A swarm of pipe-like bodies smothered"
"them, and the fight was over."
CHAPTER III
_The Coming of Greca_
The numbing shock from the tubes left the Earthmen's bodies almost
paralyzed for a time; but their brains were unfogged enough for them
to observe only too clearly all that went on from the point of their
capture.
"""What do you want it for?"""
"""Give it to me ...  Perhaps there is something in it about us ..."""
"""About whom?"""
"""About the village."""
"They laughed at him, and threw him the paper.  He took it, and read in"
"it how in the village the hail had destroyed the cornfields, how in"
"another village fire destroyed thirty houses, and that in a third a"
"woman had poisoned her family,--in fact, everything that it is"
"customary to write of,--everything, that is to say, which is bad, and"
which depicts only the worst side of the unfortunate village.  Tyapa

delight at the sad news.
"He passed the whole Sunday in reading his Bible, and never went out"
"collecting rags on that day.  While reading, he groaned and sighed"
"continually.  He kept the book close to his breast, and was angry with"
any one who interrupted him or who touched his Bible.
"""Oh, you drunken blackguard,"" said Kuvalda to him, ""what do you"
"understand of it?"""
"""Nothing, wizard!  I don't understand anything, and I do not read any"
"books ...  But I read ..."""
"""Therefore you are a fool ..."" said the Captain, decidedly. ""When there"
"are insects in your head, you know it is uncomfortable, but if some"
"thoughts enter there too, how will you live then, you old toad?"""
domineeringly:
“Giovanni Battista!”
“What is it?”
"“That’s enough, that’s enough! I can hear you from here.”"
"“That’s my wife,” said Giovanni Battista, “she doesn’t like me to be"
lacking in respect for plaster saints.” “You are a pagan!” screamed the
"old woman. “You shall see, you shall see what will happen to you.”"
"“What do you expect to have happen to me, darling?”"
"“Leave her alone,” exclaimed the elder son, ill at ease; “you always"
have to be making mother fly into a rage.”
"“No, my boy, no; she is the one who makes me fly into a rage.”"
"“Giovanni Battista is used to living among gods,” said Kennedy, “and he"
despises saints.”
"“No, no,” replied the cast-maker; “some saints are all right. If all"
"the churches had figures by Donatello or Robbia, I would go to church"
"oftener; but to go and look at those statues in the Jesuit churches,"
"those figures with their arms spread and their eyes rolling.... Oh, no!"
I cannot look at such things.”
Cæsar could see that Giovanni Battista expressed himself very well;
but that he was not precisely a star when it came to working. After the
"mould for the bas-relief was cleaned and fixed, the cast-maker invited"
Cæsar and Kennedy to have a glass of wine in a wine-shop near by.

"Or, The Career of Joy Kent"
_By Isabel Woodman Waitt_

"When Joy Kent finds herself alone in the world, thrown on her own"
"resources, after the death of her father, she looks about her, as do"
"so many young girls, fresh from the public schools, wondering how she"
can support herself and earn a place in the great business world about
"her. Still wondering, she sends a letter to a number of girls she had"
"known in school days, asking that each one tell her just how she had"
"equipped herself for a salary-earning career, and once equipped, how"
she had found it possible to start on that career. In reply come
"letters from the milliner, the stenographer, the librarian, the"
"salesgirl, the newspaper woman, the teacher, the nurse, and from girls"
who had adopted all sorts of vocations as a means of livelihood. Real
"Mr. Myre read the letter; and, as he read, his face became more like"
the hue of badly-made paste.
"He was a long time reading it, Gaston Latour’s sleepy eyes never"
leaving him.
"He burst into a harsh laugh, and flung the letter into the air:"
"“A challenge, eh? ... ha-ha! ho-ho-ho!... Tell your cousin, Monsieur"
"Latour, that the duel is relegated to the limbo of opera-bouffe."
Ho-ho-ho! We do not do these things in England.”
He prepared himself for a flight of oratory.
Gaston Latour nudged the other youth--they bowed solemnly and withdrew.
“Ho-ho! ha-ha-ha!” laughed Quogge Myre.
The following morning Mr. Quilliam O’Flaherty Macloughlin Myre’s name
"was posted in every club in Paris, and struck from the list of those to"
which he had belonged; so it came about that he had to live his day at
cafés.
"And it was as he stood at a table, giving authoritative utterance with"
"loud yawing voice to a group of youths that sat about him, vowing that"
he had determined to shake the dust of Paris from off his splay feet
"and to start a great renaissance of the English drama, when a handsome"
"young woman, sister to Gaston Latour, entered the place, walked"
"straight up to Mr. Myre, and struck him a sounding buffet on the ear"
that sent his hat flying from his head.

"“That is the Hungarian violinist Kolozsvar,” said Susanna."
"“Kolozsvar, Kolozsvar!” they heard everybody saying."
“Is he a great virtuoso?” Cæsar asked Kennedy.
"“No, I think not,” answered Kennedy. “It seems that this Hungarian’s"
"speciality is playing the waltzes and folk-songs of his own country,"
which is certainly not anything great; but his successes are not
"obtained with the violin, but among the women. The ladies in London"
"fight for him. His game is to pass himself off as a fallen man,"
"depraved, worn-out. There you have his phraseology.... They see a man to"
"save, to raise up, and convert into a great artist, and almost all of"
them yield to this temptation.”
"“That is comical,” said Cæsar, looking curiously at the fiddler and his"
lady.
"“To a Spaniard,” replied Kennedy, “it is comical; and probably it would"
be to an Italian too; but in England there are many women that have a
"purely imaginative idealism, a romanticism fed on ridiculous novels, and"
"they fall into traps like these, which seem clumsy and grotesque to you"
"here in the South, where people are more clear-sighted and realistic.”"
"Cæsar watched the brave fiddler, who played the role of a man used up,"
to great perfection.
"After tea, Susanna invited them to go up to her rooms, and Laura and her"
brother and Kennedy and Mr. Russell went.
"PAINE, CAPTAIN PETER, _alias_ LE PAIN. A French buccaneer."
"He brought into Port Royal in 1684 a merchant ship, _La Trompeuse_."
"Pretending to be the owner, he sold both ship and cargo, which brought"
"about great trouble afterwards between the French and English Governments,"
because he had stolen the ship on the high seas. He was sent from Jamaica
"under arrest to France the same year, to answer for his crimes."
"PAINTER, PETER."
"This Carolina pirate retired and lived at Charleston. In August, 1710, he"
"was recommended for the position of public powder-receiver, but was"
"rejected by the Upper House. ""Mr. Painter Having committed Piracy, and"
"not having his Majesties Pardon for the same, Its resolved he is not fit"
"for that Trust."" Which only goes to show how hard it was for a man to live"
down a thing like piracy.
"PARDAL, CAPTAIN MANUEL RIVERO."
"Known to the Jamaicans as ""the vapouring admiral of St. Jago,"" because in"
"July, 1670, he had nailed a piece of canvas to a tree on the Jamaican"
coast with this curious challenge written both in English and Spanish:
"""I, Captain Manuel Rivero Pardal, to the chief of the squadron of"
privateers in Jamaica. I am he who this year have done that which follows.
"I went on shore at Caimanos, and burnt 20 houses and fought with Captain"
"Ary, and took from him a catch laden with provisions and a canoe. And I am"
"he who took Captain Baines and did carry the prize to Cartagena, and now"
"am arrived to this coast, and have burnt it. And I come to seek General"
"listening to every word--""very curious!"""
"""Did you feel any strange sensation on the left side of your neck"
"beneath the ear, or upon your lower lip?"" inquired Deane earnestly."
"She reflected for a moment, then said:"
"""Now that I remember, there was a curious numbness of my lip."""
"""Followed immediately by unconsciousness?"""
"""Yes, almost immediately."""
"The doctors exchanged glances, which showed that the mark upon the lip"
was the chief enigma of the situation.
"Trepard glanced at his watch, dissolved yet another pillule of hydrated"
"peroxide of iron, and handed her the draught to swallow.  The antidote"
had acted almost like magic.
"""You are absolutely certain that no person entered the room after Ingram"
"had left?"" repeated Deane, as though not yet satisfied."
"""Absolutely."""
"Dick Deane turned his eyes full upon me, and I divined his thoughts.  He"
was reflecting upon the conversation held between us before we entered
that room.  He was endeavouring to worm from her some clue to her
secret.

"A Christian hymn is a lyric poem, reverently and devotionally"
"conceived, which is designed to be sung and which expresses the"
"worshiper’s attitude toward God, or God’s purposes, in human life."
"L. F. Benson, America’s foremost hymnologist, defines a hymn in these"
simple words:
The Christian hymn ... is a form of words appropriate to be sung or
chanted in public devotions.
"A hymn is to be sung _by a congregation_. Its message must be simple,"
"not subtle. It must read well and sing well. In modern usage, the hymn"
is not limited to the praise of God but includes other moods of worship
such as resignation and consecration.
2. The Beginnings of Christian Song.
Hymn singing has always been associated with Christian worship. Jesus
"and the Twelve sang a hymn, presumably a portion of the _Hallel_ (Ps."
"115-118), after the Supper was ended. Paul and Silas sang hymns, “songs"
"of the night,” during the midnight hours of their imprisonment in"
Philippi. The great Apostle recognized the value of song when he
exhorted the churches thus:
Be filled with the Spirit; speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns
"and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the"
"Lord. Eph. 5:18, 19."
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and
"admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,"
singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. Col. 3:16.
"""Nothing to report,"" announced Barracombe, as Aubyn relieved him as"
"officer of the watch. ""A jolly fine night. I shouldn't wonder if we"
"were favoured by a visit from a Zeppelin or two."""
"""A pretty jamb in the harbour,"" said Terence, giving a quick glance"
"at the maze of vessels. ""Fortunately, I hear, we've several seaplanes"
"at our disposal."""
Barracombe wished his relief good-night and descended the ladder to
retire to the seclusion of his cabin and sleep the sleep of
"exhaustion, for he had had a strenuous time before the cruiser left"
Devonport.
During the first hour nothing unusual occurred. The midshipman of the
"watch reported ""Rounds all correct, sir,"" to which Aubyn replied with"
"the stereotyped ""Very good."" Across the harbour came the faint hail"
of the Night Guard as the picquet boat studiously visited every
vessel within the limits of the breakwater.

"Lilly's house on the Strand within three hours, to meet the French king's"
"ambassador, and to receive the instructions which George's letter had"

the person we had expected to see.
"The evening before, she was ready to die of fright because we believed"
"that the Abbé was George Hamilton, and now, since I had found he was not,"
she was ready to die of disappointment--so she assured me.
"At the appointed time, De Grammont, the Abbé, and I took the count's"

"TOWNLEY, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer."
A buccaneer who in the year 1684 was one of the mixed English and French
"fleet blockading Panama. On this occasion, he commanded a ship with a crew"
of 180 men. By the next year the quarrels between the English had reached
such a pitch that Townley and Swan left Davis and sailed in search of
"their French friends. In May, 1685, Townley was amongst the company that"
"took and sacked Guayaquil. In January, 1686, Townley rescued the French"
"pirate Grogniet and some 350 Frenchmen who, when attacking the town of"
"Quibo, were surprised by a Spanish squadron, which burnt their vessels"
while the crews were on shore. Townley then sailed north with his French
comrades and sacked Granada.
"His next adventure was to take the town of Lavelia, near to Panama, where"
he found a rich cargo which the Viceroy had placed on shore because he was
afraid to send it to sea when so many pirates were about.
"In August of the same year, Townley's ship was attacked by three Spanish"
"men-of-war. A furious fight took place, which ended by two of the Spanish"
ships being captured and the third burnt. In this action the gallant
"Townley was gravely wounded, and died shortly afterwards."
"TRISTRIAN, CAPTAIN. French buccaneer."
"In the year 1681 Dampier, with other malcontents, broke away from Captain"
Sharp and marched on foot across the Isthmus of Darien. After undergoing
"terrible hardships for twenty-two days, the party arrived on the Atlantic"
"seaboard, to find Captain Tristrian with his ship lying in La Sounds Cay."
"The buccaneers bought red, blue, and green beads, and knives, scissors,"
"_Elizabeth and Katherine_, off the coast of West Africa. Fitting her out"
"for a pirate, they named her the _Flying King_, and Sample was put in"
"command. In company with Captain Low, he sailed to Brazil and did much"
mischief amongst the Portuguese shipping. In November of the same year the
two pirate ships were attacked by a very powerful man-of-war. Lane got
"away, but Sample was compelled to run his ship ashore on the coast. Of his"
"crew of seventy men, twelve were killed and the rest taken prisoners, of"
"whom the Portuguese hanged thirty-eight. Of these, thirty-two were"

"outside, since everybody now-a-days wanted you to subscribe to"
"something, and it was so disagreeable having to say ""no."" She was"
not a great walker so she could not enjoy the Talbot woods; the sea

"""Ask him what he thinks of Hindenburg."""

"""No, I have just come,"" said he. ""It must have been some one else who"
"had taken my shape!"""
Then she gradually came to her senses; but not until long afterward was
"she altogether herself, and she told how she had firmly believed that"
"her sweetheart himself, and all their friends and relatives had been"
"there. He took her straight back to the village with him, and so that"
"they need fear no such deviltry in the future, they celebrated their"
wedding while she was still clad in the bridal outfit of the underground
folk. The crown and all the ornaments were hung up in Melbustad and it
is said that they hang there to this very day.

Black jugglery and deception are practiced upon the poor
"dairy-maid in ""The Troll Wedding"" (Asbjörnsen, _Huldreeventyr_, I,"
"p. 50. From Hadeland, told by a _Signekjarring_, a kind of wise"
woman or herb doctress). Characteristic is the belief that troll
magic and witchery may be nullified if a gun be fired over the
place where it is supposed to be taking place. Then all reverts to
"its original form. Curious, also, is the belief that trolls like"
"to turn into skeins of yarn when disturbed, and then roll swiftly"

"ROCHE, CAPTAIN PHILIP, _alias_ JOHN EUSTACE."
"In company with three other mariners--Cullen, Wife, and Neale--this Irish"
"pirate shipped himself on board a French snow at Cork in November, 1721,"
"for a passage to Nantes. Owing to Roche's briskness, genteel manners, and"
"knowledge of navigation, the master used occasionally to place him in"
charge of the vessel. One night a few days out a pre-arranged mutiny took
"place, the French crew being butchered and thrown overboard. The captain,"
"who pleaded for mercy, was also thrown into the sea. Driven by bad weather"
"to Dartmouth, the new captain, Roche, had the ship repainted and"
"disguised, and renamed her the _Mary_. Then sailing to Rotterdam he sold"
"the cargo of beef and took on a fresh cargo with the owner, Mr. Annesly."
"The first night out of port they threw Mr. Annesly overboard, and he swam"
alongside for some while pleading to be taken in. On going into a French
"port, and hearing that an enquiry was being made about his ship, Roche ran"
"away. The crew took the ship to Scotland, and there landed and"
"disappeared, and the ship was seized and taken to the Thames."
"Later on Roche was arrested in London and committed to Newgate Prison,"
"found guilty of piracy, and hanged on August 5th, 1723, at Execution Dock,"
"at the age of 30. The hanging was not, from the public spectators point of"
"view, a complete success, for the culprit ""was so ill at the time that he"
could not make any public declaration of his abhorrence of the crime for

"A ""Flanderkin."""
"""You've got some singular new attraction about you, Alwyn,""--he said,"
with a strange sense of keen inward excitement as he met his friend's
"calm yet flashing glance,--""Something mysterious, . . something that"
COMPELS! What is it? ... I believe that visit of yours to the Ruins of
"Babylon had a more important motive than you will admit, . . moreover.."
"I believe you are in love!"""
"""IN love!""--Alwyn laughed a little as he repeated the words.. ""What a"
foolish term that is when you come to think of it! For to be IN love
"suggests the possibility of getting OUT again,--which, if love be true,"
can never happen. Say that I LOVE!--and you will be nearer the mark!
"Now don't look so mystified, and don't ask me any more questions just"
"now--to-night, when we are sitting together in the library, I'll tell"
"you the whole story of my Babylonian adventure!"""
"And with a light parting wave of the hand he left the room, and"
Villiers heard him humming a tune softly to himself as he ascended the
"stairs to his own apartments, where, ever since he arrived, he had made"
it his custom to do two or three hours' steady writing every morning.
"For a moment or so after he had gone Villiers stood lost in thought,"
"with knitted brows and meditative eyes, then, rousing himself, he went"
"on to his study, and sitting down at his desk wrote an answer to the"
Duchess de la Santoisie accepting her invitation.

REWARDS OF FAME.
heard from the crippled dwarf.
"""It has nothing to do with you,"" she repeated; ""it is a matter of the"
"Gitanos!"""
"But there came up from the bottom of the ravine, the lantern-jawed"
"Sergeant, long, silent, lean, parched as a Manchegan cow whose pasture"
has been burnt up by a summer sun. With one beckoning finger he summoned
"La Giralda apart, and she obeyed him as readily as the boy had obeyed"
"her. They communed a long time together, the old gipsy speaking, the"
coffee-coloured Sergeant listening with his head a little to the side.
At the end of the colloquy Sergeant Cardono went directly up to Rollo
and saluted.
"""Is it permitted for me to speak a word to your Excellency concerning"
"the objects of the expedition?"" he said, with his usual deference."
"""Certainly!"" answered Rollo; ""for me, my mission is a secret one, but I"
"have no instructions against listening."""
The Sergeant bowed his head.
"""Whatever be our mission you will find me do my duty,"" he said; ""and"
"since this cursed plague may interfere with all your plans, it is well"
that you should know what has befallen and what is designed. You will
pardon me for saying that it takes no great prophet to discover that our
"purposes have to do with the movements of the court."""
Rollo glanced at him keenly.
"""Did General Cabrera reveal anything to you before your departure?"" he"
"“How’s this, are you leaving already, father?” said Simonetta, as he"
went through the shop to get to the street.
"“I’m coming back, I’m coming back right away.”"
_SUPERSTITIONS_
"The three of them went to a rather dirty tavern in the same lane,"
and settled themselves by the window. This post was a good point of
"observation for that narrow street, so crowded and so picturesque."
"Workmen went by, and itinerant vendors, women with kerchiefs, half"
"head-dress and half muffler, and with black eyes and expressive faces."
"Opposite was a booth of coloured candies, dried figs strung on a reed,"
and various kinds of sweets.
"A wine-cart passed, and Kennedy made Cæsar observe how decorative it"
"was with its big arm-seat in the middle and its hood above, like a"
prompter’s box.
Giovanni Battista ordered a flask of wine for the three of them. While
"he chatted and drank, friends of his came to greet them. They were men"
"with beards, long hair, and soft hats, of the Garbaldi and Verdi type so"
abundant in Italy.
"Among them were two serious old men; one was a model, a native of"
"Frascati, with the face of a venerable apostle; the other, for contrast,"
"looked like a buffoon and was the possessor of a grotesque nose, long,"
thin at the end and adorned with a red wart.
"""Yes,"" he answered, ""and I shall visit him without delay."""
"""In Paris?"" I asked, not quite sure that Monsieur le Grand was King Louis"
"of France, and not desiring to know certainly."
"""In Paris,"" he answered, giving me to understand by his manner that he"
must tell me nothing more definite of Le Grand's identity.
"""Don't tell me what you know of the business this letter refers to, but"
"tell me whether you know,"" I said, hoping that George might at least tell"
me it meant good fortune for him.
"""I cannot even conjecture the business upon which I am wanted,"" he said,"
"""but I hope that it may give me an opportunity to be of service to the"
"writer."""
Thus I was relieved of the disagreeable task of trying to induce George
"to leave England, and was very thankful to escape it."
"After a long silence, during which he read the one-line letter many"
"times, he asked:--"
"""Are you willing to bring Frances to me early to-morrow morning, if she"
"will come?"""
"""Doubtless I can,"" I answered. ""Her willingness to come has been shown"
"all too plainly of late; but ought I bring her?"""
"""Yes. It will be the last time I shall ever see her unless good fortune"
"lies in this letter, and for that I hardly dare hope. You know that when"
"a man's luck has been against him for a long time, it kills the very"
roots of hope and brings him almost to doubt certainty. Soon after I have

"_Johan Johan_, or, at greater length, _The Merry Play between Johan"
"Johan the Husband, Tyb his Wife, and Sir Jhon the Priest_ (printed"
"1533), contains only the three characters mentioned, but possesses a"
"theme more nearly deserving the name of plot than do the other two,"
"namely, the contriving and carrying out of a plan by Tyb for exposing"
"her boastful husband's real and absolute subjection to her rule. Yet,"
"even so, it is extremely simple. Johan Johan is first heard alone,"
declaring how he will beat his wife for not being at home. The tuggings
"of fear and valour in his heart, however, give his monologue an"
"argumentative form, in which first one motive and then the other gains"
"the upper hand, very similar to the conflict between Launcelot Gobbo's"
conscience and the Devil. He closes in favour of the beating and
then--Tyb comes home. Oh the difference! Johan Johan suspects his wife

"penetrated, through the fuliginous vapours whence it proceeded, into the"
"crystal regions of the man's spirit. It was he, after a while, who held"
"Risca with his eyes, and it was all that was beautiful and spiritual"
in Risca that was held. And then Herold reached out his hand slowly and
touched him.
“We go down to Southcliff together.”
Risca drew a deep breath.
"“Let us go this evening,” said he."
A few hours afterward when the open cab taking them from the station
to the Channel House came by the sharp turn of the road abruptly to the
"foot of the cliff, and the gusty southwest wind brought the haunting"
"smell of the seaweed into his nostrils, and he saw the beacon-light in"
"the high west window shining like a star, a gossamer feather from the"
wings of Peace fell upon the man's tortured soul.
CHAPTER III
IT will be remembered that Stellamaris was a young person of bountiful
fortune. She had stocks and shares and mortgages and landed property
faithfully administered under a deed of trust. The Channel House and
"all that therein was, except Sir Oliver and Lady Blount's grievances,"
belonged to her. She knew it; she had known it almost since infancy.
The sense of ownership in which she had grown up had its effect on her
"character, giving her the equipoise of a young reigning princess, calm"
"""A LADY! ... To see Mr. Alwyn!""--he repeated, his thoughts instantly"
"reverting to his friend's vaguely hinted love-affair,--""What name?"""
"""She gives no name, sir. She says it isn't needed,--Mr. Alwyn will know"
"who she is."""
"""Mr. Alwyn will know who she is, will he?"" murmured Villiers"
"dubiously.--""What is she like? Young and pretty?"""
"Over the man-servant's staid countenance came the glimmer of a demure,"
respectful smile.
"""Oh no, sir,--not young, sir! A person about fifty, I should say."""
This was mystifying. A person about fifty! Who could she be? Villiers
"hastily considered,--there must be some mistake, he thought,--at any"
"rate, he would see the unknown intruder himself first, and find out"
"what her business was, before breaking in upon Alwyn's peaceful studies"
upstairs.
"""Show the lady in here""--he said--""I can't disturb Mr. Alwyn just now."""
"The servant retired, and soon re-appeared, ushering in a tall, gaunt,"
"black-robed female, who walked with the stride of a dragoon and the"
"demeanor of a police-inspector, and who, merely nodding briskly in"
"response to Villiers's amazed bow, selected with one comprehensive"
"glance the most comfortable chair in the room, and seated herself at"
"ease therein. She then put up her veil, displaying a long, narrow face,"
"cold, pale, arrogant eyes, a nose inclined to redness at the tip, and a"
"thin, close-set mouth lined with little sarcastic wrinkles, which came"
"into prominent and unbecoming play as soon as she began to speak, which"
she did almost immediately.
"Upon my insistence, he accepted the gold and gave me the ten guineas he"
"had borrowed from Lilly, asking me to return them."
Frances was making an entire failure of her effort to hold herself in
"check, and George was having difficulty in restraining himself, so, to"
"bring the interview to an end, he gave me his hand, saying:--"
"""Thank you, Ned, and good-by. I wish I could hope ever to see you again,"
"but if Le Grand fails me, I shall go to the new world and lose myself in"
"the Canadian woods."""
"""No, no!"" cried Frances, imploringly."
"""I hope not,"" began George, but he could not finish, so he took Frances"
"in his arms for a moment, and when he released her, thrust us both out"
"the door, saying: ""Please leave me at once. If you do not, I fear I shall"
"never let her go. Take care of her, Ned. Good-by!"""
"The door closed on us, and when Frances had put on her vizard, she"
followed me upstairs to see Betty.
"I was not admitted to Betty's room, so I went back to the printing shop"
"for a moment, and George gave me the key to the cipher, in which we were"
"to write to each other. His letters were to be sent under cover to Lilly,"
and mine were to go to an address in Paris which George would send to me.
"Long afterwards George told me of his adventures in making his escape,"
but I shall give them now in the order of their happening rather than in
the order of time in which I learned them.
"Leaving the Old Swan within ten minutes after I had said good-by to him,"
"The little withered lady, all pleased excitement, said: “_Quite_"
"thrilling, James!”"
"Pangbutt seeing awkwardness at the door, and missing the loud"
"announcement of names, went a few paces closer to it to meet his"
newly-arrived guests.
"The little old gentleman entered the room vaguely, the dandruff of"
"the philosophic habit upon his coat-collar, and his wig full of"
reasons--very markedly a professor. He had the air of cataloguing
"ideas. The little old lady, a couple of paces behind him, followed him."
Pangbutt exchanged greetings with him.
Said the professor:
"“Good-evening, sir; my sister’s husband’s brother-in-law, Sir Gilders"
"Persimmon, was good enough to say that you would allow me to meet"
Mr. Anthony Bickersteth here.... I am writing a work to disprove
the insanity of genius.... It is a part of my theory that the human
personality cannot be hidden by artifice--that the strong temperament
shows itself in the vigorous growth of the hair--and so on.... I
"am, sir, I may have forgotten to say, Professor Curtis.... I am an"
"inveterate novel-reader.... My wife keeps a diary.... Where are you,"
"Charlotte? Ah, yes. But, fervently as I admire Mr. Bickersteth’s prose,"
I should like to suggest to him that in his next work he might make
"more of that unworked mine, the folk-lore of the London coster--or"
greengrocer.... I am most anxious that Mr. Bickersteth should be a
virile person whose moustache springs out strongly from under the
"nostrils, with a tendency towards ruddiness in the colouring.... But"
"I fear that on this--what I may call his--er,” he tittered--“his"
"girl's arm and whispered in her ear that she must be brave, a true"
"Andaluse, and not compromise the expedition by any spoken word."
"Concha turned indignantly upon her, shaking off her restraining hand as"
she did so.
"""Do you think I am a fool?"" she whispered. ""I will do nothing to spoil"
"their chances. But oh, Giralda, at any moment he might be shot!"""
"""Trust José Maria. He hath taken risks far greater than this,"" said La"
"Giralda in a low voice, wilfully mistaking her meaning. But Concha,"
"quite unconsoled, did nothing but clasp her hands and quicken her"
supplications to the Virgin.
"The ladder was reared against the gilded iron railing and Rollo mounted,"
immediately dropping lightly down on the further side. The Sergeant
"followed, and presently both were on the ground. At a word from Rollo,"
El Sarria pushed the ladder over and the two received it and laid it
along the parapet in a place where it would remain completely hidden
till wanted.
"The two moved off together in the direction of the porter's lodge, at"
"the door of which the Sergeant knocked lightly, and then, obtaining no"
"answer, with more vehemence. A window was lifted and a frightened voice"
asked who came there at that time of night.
The Sergeant answered with some sharpness that they wished for the key
of the great gate.
Upon this the same old woman who had ushered out La Giralda appeared
"trembling at the lattice, and was but little relieved when the Sergeant,"
"putting on his most serious air, informed her that her life was in the"
"if you wish to make sure whether it is a good auspice or a bad, you kill"
"the spider and count its legs. If they are an even number, it is a good"
"omen; if uneven, bad.”"
"“But I believe spiders always have an even number of legs,” said Cæsar."
"“Certainly,” responded the old man; “but my wife swears they do not;"
that she has seen many with seven and nine legs. It is religious
unreasonableness.”
"“Are there many people like that, so credulous?” asked Cæsar."
"“Oh, lots,” replied Lanza; “in the shops you will find amulets, horns,"
"hands made of coral or horseshoes, all to keep away bad luck. My wife"
"and the neighbour women play the lottery, by combining the numbers of"
"their birthdays, and the ages of their fathers, their mothers, and their"
"children. When some relative dies, they make a magic combination of"
"the dates of birth and death, the day and the month, and buy a lottery"
ticket. They never win; and instead of realizing that their systems
"are of no avail, they say that they omitted to count in the number of"
"letters in the name or something of that sort. It is comical, so much"
religion and so much superstition.”
"“But you confuse religion and superstition, my friend,” said Kennedy."
"“It’s all the same,” answered the old man, smiling his suavely ironical"
smile. “There is nothing except Nature.”
"“You do not believe in miracles, Giovanni Battista?” asked the"
Englishman.
"“Yes, I believe in the earth’s miracles, making trees and flowers grow,"

may be stated that love is but one of the bodily passions that dies with
"it; however, even in some of the stories themselves, this explanation is"
used to clear certain difficulties; however opposed eternal love may be
"to one of the central doctrines of Buddhism, it seems to me that the"
very essence of this story is the belief that love does not die with the
"body, that it lives for ever and ever, through incarnation after"
incarnation. Such a story is the very cry of the agony of humanity.
"'Love is strong as death; many waters cannot quench love;' ay, and love"
"is stronger than death. Not any dogmas of any religion, not any"
"philosophy, nothing in this world, nothing in the next, shall prevent"
him who loves from the certainty of rejoining some time the soul he
loves.

done with earthly things.
CHAPTER XXIV
THE FOREST OF TIME
'The gate of that forest was Death.'
There was a great forest. It was full of giant trees that grew so high
and were so thick overhead that the sunshine could not get down below.
"And there were huge creepers that ran from tree to tree climbing there,"
"""You have need of better marksmen,"" he said; ""even the Migueletes could"
"not do worse than that!"""
"""Who are you?"" demanded a tall grey-headed gipsy, who like the Sergeant"
"had remained apparently unarmed; ""what is your right to be here?"""
The Sergeant had by this time seated himself on a detached boulder and
was rolling a cigarette. He did not trouble to look up as he answered
"carelessly, ""To the Gitano my name is José Maria of Ronda!"""
The effect of his words was instantaneous. The men who had been ready to
"kill him a moment before almost fell at his feet, though here and there"
some remained apparently unconvinced.
Prominent among these was the elderly man who had put the question to
the Sergeant. Without taking his eyes from those of the Carlist soldier
"he exclaimed, ""Our great José Maria you cannot be. For with these eyes I"
"saw him garrotted in the Plaza Mayor of Salamanca!"""
The Sergeant undid his stock and pointed to a blood-red band about his
"neck, indented deeply into the skin, and more apparent at the back and"
sides than in front.
"""Garrotted in good faith I was in the Plaza of Salamanca, as this"
"gentleman says,"" he remarked with great coolness. ""But not to death. The"
"executioner was as good a _Gitano_ as myself, and removed the spike"
which strikes inward from the back. So you see I am still José Maria of
"Ronda in the flesh, and able to strike a blow for myself!"""
The gipsies set up a wild yell. The name of the most celebrated and most
lawless of their race stirred them to their souls.

"seizure for the purpose of the detention, requisition, or destruction of"
"any ship or goods which, but for any convention, would be liable to"
"condemnation, and the expressions ""captured"" and ""taken as prize"" shall"
"be construed accordingly, and where any ship or goods have been so"

"It was by no means a difficult task to replace the stone, as it was thin"
"and had been nicely fitted into the opening. In a short time the boys,"
"proceeding mostly on their hands and knees, came to the end of the"
tunnel and looked out over a valley tucked in between two great summits.
"The snow-line was not far away and the air was cold, notwithstanding the"
direct rays of the sun.
"There was no one in sight, no moving object anywhere, as the boys paused"
at the mouth of the passage and gazed about. Judging from the location
"of the sun, they were looking straight west."
"“Now,” Ned said after a pause, “if we follow this little valley straight"
"to the south, we’ll come out somewhere near our camp.”"
"“Yes,” Jimmie answered, “I have a pious notion that our brownstone front"
is carved into the face of a continuation of that ridge on the other
side of the little valley.”
"“Perhaps we’ll find the Boy Scout messenger at the camp,” Ned suggested."
"“If we do,” Jimmie declared, “I’ll change his face for him!”"
"“I can’t understand the fellow,” Ned admitted."
"“Gee!” cried Jimmie, “He came out into the woods and told Frank and I to"
"beat it, then went up into the camp and led you into the clutches of"
"these outlaws. If I had his head in chancery right now, I’d ‘beat it’,"
all right! He ought to get a thousand years!”
"“I hope the boys are all safe,” said Ned."

THE ART OF PRESCRIBING
The prescription should be as brief and simple as possible. It should be
explicit and clearly written. It may be expressed either in Latin or in
English. The manner in which the medicine is to be used should be
"specified. Important instructions as to the rule, systematic regulations"
or diet of the patient are sometimes necessary.
Prescriptions usually contain two or more of the following four
representative constituents: (1) The _basis_ or active ingredients. The
practice of conjoining several active medicines has wisely been
"abandoned. Occasionally, however, it may be advantageous to give"
together two medicines producing their effects in somewhat different
"ways. Thus, spasms of the bowels are more often effectually controlled"
by the conjunction of a stimulant like ether and an anodyne like opium
than by either given alone. Pain which is not alleviated by either
morphine or atropine is sometimes abated by giving them together. (2)
"The _adjuvant_ is introduced in order to increase, moderate or modify"
the action of the basis. Frequently its chief object is to insure
solubility and ready absorption. (3) A _corrective_ is occasionally
attract the surly pair who played at cards.
"""Now you might try Airedale and Pekinese,"" Tommy suggested, but this was"
lost on the serious little man. Yet he did call in another strangely
"sounding tongue, then with a sigh laid the megaphone down, saying:"
"""They must be stuffies!"""
"""Dummies, sir, dummies,"" Tommy corrected. ""Nice people don't say"
"stuffies, ever!"""
"""Your Tommy does so much cut-upping, eh!"" he smiled at me. I had noticed"
that when preoccupied or excited the idioms of his various languages got
tumbled into a rather hopeless potpourri.
Quarantine and customs were passed in the leisurely fashion of Cuban
"officials, and Monsieur asked to be sent immediately ashore, promising"
"to return at sundown. There was a man, the secret agent, he explained,"
who held important information.
"""I'll have the launch for you at Machina wharf, sir,"" Gates told him,"
"but he refused to consider this, declaring that he could hire any of the"
boatmen thereabout to bring him out.
"""He's that considerate, sir,"" Gates later confided to me. ""But I carn't"
make head nor tail of him. Bilkins says he went in to lay out his
"clothes, and the things he's got stuck in those bags would astonish"
"you!"""
"Nearing six o'clock a skiff drew alongside, being propelled by one"
oar--a method much in vogue with Havana harbormen--and when Monsieur
came aboard we saw at once evidences of disappointment. His arms hung
conditions seem to be reversed--the eight legs and two tails and two necks
"with one head pointing to enlargement of the land, whereas a double foetus"
with only six or five feet forebodes some impending misfortune[41].
Let us proceed further with this text.
"If it is a double foetus, one well formed and the second issuing from"
"the mouth of the first[42], the king will be killed and his army will"
"[revolt ?], his oil plantation and his dwelling will be destroyed[43]."
"If it is a double foetus, the second lying at the tail [of the"
"first], with two breasts and two tails, there will be no unity in the"
land[44].
"If it is a double foetus, and the second lies at the tail of the"
"first and enclosed and both are living, ditto."
"If it is a double foetus, and one rides over the other, victory,"
throne will support throne.
If it is a double foetus and one rides over the other and there is
"only one head, the power of the king will conquer the enemy's land."
"If it is a double foetus, one above and one below, with only one"
"spine and eight feet, four [Variant: 'two'] ears, and two tails,"
throne will support throne.
"If it is a double foetus with the faces downward, approach of the son"
"of the king, who will take the throne of his father, or a second son"
"of the king will die, or a third son of the king will die."

"“And then,” Frank went on, “Dad might take a notion to send an"
"expedition out here to round up these dirty greasers. If he does, I’m"
coming out just on purpose to see them hanged.”
“Cut it out!” advised Jack.
"“Of all the rotten, unwashed specimens of humanity I ever came across,”"
"Frank continued, speaking in a still louder tone, “this escort of ours"
takes the bun. They’re imitation bad-men all right.”
"“A little of that goes a long way, young man,” the leader of the party"
"said. “It makes no difference to me what you say, but several of these"
men understand the English language and can speak it fluently.”
"“I presume so,” returned Frank. “I’ve seen just such a collection as"
"that in jail in New York. Say, honest, Captain,” he went on, “if a bunch"
"like this should run up against the strong-arm squad in New York, they’d"
get their heads beaten off just because of their ugly mugs.”
"“Aw, what’s the use!” demanded Harry."
"By this time several of the guards were casting ugly glances at Frank,"
who seemed to regard their disfavor with great joy.
"“You’d better come on ahead and walk with me, young fellow,” the leader"
"said, taking Frank roughly by the arm and jerking him to a position in"
"front. “If you get back there where those ugly ones are, they’ll put a"
couple of bullets into your back and swear that you were trying to
escape.”
"On his way to the front of the party, Frank passed Jack and paused for a"
"He stopped her at last, and they talked in the half-light, floating"
"along together half dreamily, as if upon the bosom of some great"
current that bore them into strange regions which they dreaded yet
longed to explore.
"They heard a child crying somewhere in the rear of the house, and"
"Chakawana's voice soothing, then in a moment the Indian girl appeared"
in the doorway saying something about going out with Constantine.
"Cherry acquiesced half consciously, impatient of the intrusion."
"For a long time they talked, so completely in concord that for the most"
part their voices were low and their sentences so incomplete that they
would have sounded incoherent and foolish to other ears. They were
roused finally by the appreciation that it had grown very late and a
"storm was brewing. Boyd rose, and going to the door, saw that the sky"
"was deeply overcast, rendering the night as dark as in a far lower"
latitude.
"""I've overstayed my welcome,"" he ventured, and smiled at her answering"
laugh.
"With a trace of solicitude, she said:"
"""Wait! I'll get you a rain-coat,"" but he reached out a detaining hand."
In the darkness it encountered the bare flesh of her arm.
"""Please don't! You'd have to strike a light to find it, and I don't"
"want a light now."""

that he heard her sharp-drawn breath.

"social behavior and make him give himself up. Then he--he--"""
"She pressed her fingernails into her palms and let out a long, glaring"
"sigh at the door. ""Then he kissed me! Oh, it was a good enough"
kiss--Mr. Brown has evidently had a varied and colorful background--but
"the galling idiocy of the man, trying that! I was just getting over the"
colossal impudence involved in _his_ proposing marriage--as if _he_ had
"to bear the children!--and was considering the offer seriously, on its"
"merits, as one should consider _all_ suggestions, when he deliberately"
dropped the pretense of reason. He appealed to me as most of the savage
"ancients appealed to their women, as an emotional machine. Throw the"
"correct sexual switches, says this theory, and the female surrenders"
herself ecstatically to the doubtful and bloody murk of masculine
"plans."""

There was a double knock on the door and the Captain walked in without
waiting for an invitation. He was still holding Butt's blaster. He
"pointed it at me. ""Get your hands up, Ferdinand Sparling,"" he said."
I did.
"""I hereby order your detention for the duration of this voyage, for"
"aiding and abetting a stowaway, as set forth in Sections Forty-one and"
"Forty-five--"""
"""Forty-three and Forty-five,"" Sis interrupted him, her eyes getting"
"larger and rounder. ""But you gave me your word of honor that no charges"
"would be lodged against the boy!"""
"“In return,” said he, “I hope you will allow me to send in some jellies"
"and fruits, or appliances, or whatever may be of pleasure or comfort to"
the child.”
"“Whatever you send her that is practical shall be applied to her use,”"
said the Sister superintendent.
"She was cold, unemotional; no smile, no ghost even of departed smiles,"
"seemed ever to visit the tired, gray eyes or the corners of the rigid"
mouth; coif and face and thin hands were spotless. She did not even
thank him for his forced gift to the orphanage.
"“I should like to know,” said John, regarding her beneath frowning"
"brows, “whether any one here loves the unhappy little wretch.”"
"“These children,” replied the Sister superintendent, “have naturally a"
hard battle to fight when they go from here into the world. They come
"mostly from vicious classes. Their training is uniformly kind, but it"
has to be austere.”
John rose. “I will bring what things I can think of to-morrow.”
"The Sister superintendent rose, too, and bowed icily. “You are at"
"liberty to do so, Mr. Risca; but I assure you there is no reason for"
your putting yourself to the trouble. In the circumstances I can readily
understand your solicitude; but again I say you have no cause for it.”
"“Madam,” said he, “I see that I have more cause than ever.”"
"The next day he drove to the orphanage in a cab, with a hamper of"
delicacies and a down pillow. The latter the Sister superintendent
speak; but finding nothing epigrammatic enough to say--and an epigram
alone would have saved the situation--he planted a carefully cut cigar
"between the parted lips aforesaid, and deliberately struck a match."
"“Your idea, John,” said Lady Blount, aware of victory, “is preposterous."
What would Stella do without you?”
"“Yes,” said Sir Oliver, after lighting his cigar; “Stella has to be"
considered before everything.”
Risca frowned on the unblushing turncoat. Stella! Stella! Everything
"was Stella. Here were three ordinary, sane, grown-up people seriously"
putting forward the proposition that he had no right to go and mend his
own broken life in his own fashion because he happened to be the favored
playmate of a little invalid girl!
"On the one side was the driving force of Furies of a myriad hell-power,"
and on the other the disappointment of Stella Blount. It was ludicrous.
"Even Walter Herold, who had a sense of humour, did not see the grotesque"
incongruity. Risca frowned upon each in turn--upon three serene faces
smilingly aware of the absurd. Was it worth while trying to convince
them?
"“Our dear friends are quite right, John,” said Herold. “What would"
become of Stella if you went away?”
"“None of you seems to consider what would happen to me if I stayed,”"
"said John, in the quiet tone of a man who is talking to charming but"
"unreasonable children. “It will go to my heart to leave Stella, more"
"than any of you can realize; but to Australia I go, and there's an end"
of it.”
"""Then my name can't seem very odd to you, Miss Graham!"""
She was regarding me as though trying to discover what kind of a species
"I was that had got on her father's yacht, when the sailor came back"
followed by a husky brute in uniform. Intuitively I stiffened to meet
"the crisis, but even at this eleventh hour a respite came."
"""He ain't aboard,"" the other Jack whispered, and the captain--for the"
"burly one was only the captain, after all--saluted, saying:"
"""I've just now found out, ma'am, he ain't aboard!"""
"""Not aboard? What do you mean?"""
"""After bringing you on last night he went ashore again to get a little"

"Cast back upon his own thoughts, Rollo reviewed many things--his short"

"himself. ""It is better as it is. If I have done little good, perhaps I"
"have not had time to do a great deal of harm."""
"Then very contentedly he curled himself up to sleep as best he might,"
only dreamily wondering if little Concha would be sorry when she heard.
Ramon Garcia sat with his eyes fixed on the sentry who had ceased his

[17] It was a bad day for the cause of truth when Foxe's _Book of
Martyrs_ was allowed to go out of general circulation. When I was a boy
it was no uncommon thing to see copies of it in American homes. Now it
is rarely seen. A new and corrected edition of it ought to be brought
out and given wide circulation. There have been not a few indications
this year that our people are forgetting some of the most instructive
"history of all the past, and those who seem to be most oblivious of it"
are the editors of some of the secular newspapers.
"[18] There are other indications of some improvement in this matter,"
"but an Anglican resident in Italy, quoted by the _Review of Reviews_ as"
"""a painstaking and fair-minded"" witness, says, ""People are not shocked"
"by clerical immorality, but regard it as natural and inevitable."" To an"
Anglican friend a Roman prelate lamented that a certain cardinal was
"not elected at the late conclave. But the Anglican replied, ""He is a"
"man of conspicuous immorality."" ""No doubt,"" was the answer, ""but you"
Americans seem to think there is no virtue but chastity. The Cardinal
"has not that, but he is an honest man."""
CHAPTER XXXII.
THE OLD FORCES AND THE NEW IN THE ETERNAL CITY.
[Sidenote: An Audience with the Pope.]
"Well, we have seen the Pope. Hearing that a body of Italian pilgrims"
"were to be received by the pontiff at the Vatican, and having assured"
“Of course it is--a delightful one--to see dear Yvonne and yourself.
Where are you staying?”
"“At the Océan,” said the Canon, “and you must all come and dine with us"
this evening.”
“And will you come to the _bal_ here afterward?” asked Sophia. “Evan has
run across some college friends--or won’t you think it proper?”
"“I am going to wear the whole suit of motley while I am here,” replied"
the Canon gaily.
"He kept his word, not being a man of half measures. No check should be"
"placed on Yvonne’s enjoyment. She had been moping, as far as Yvonne could"
"mope, during the latter dullness of Fulminster; now she expanded like a"
flower to the gaiety around her. The Canon found an aesthetic pleasure
in watching her happiness. Her expressions of thanks too were charmingly
"conveyed. Since that unfortunate attempt on his part, over a twelvemonth"
"back, to instruct her in the responsibilities of her position, she had"
never exhibited toward him such spontaneous feeling. He let her smile
"upon whom she would, without a twinge of jealousy."
Yvonne enjoyed herself hugely. She danced and jested with the young men;
"she chattered in French to her table d’hôte neighbours, delighted to"
speak her mother’s tongue again; she staked two-franc pieces on the
"public table, and one afternoon came out of the gaming-room into the"
"great hall where the Canon was sitting with Mrs. Winstanley, and poured"
a great mass of silver on to the table--as much as her two small hands
joined could carry.
"“I thought gambling was against your principles, Everard,” said Mrs."
The gross rapacity of the Flemings in Spain under Philip I is
"admitted by Motley (_Rise_, as cited, pp. 31, 75); but on the same"
score feeling was passionately strong in Spain in the earlier years
"of the reign of Charles. Cp. Robertson, _Charles V_, bk. i (Works,"
"ed. 1821, iv, 37, 40, 43, 44, 46, 47, 52, 53, 55, 77 78); and van"
"Kampen, _Geschichte der Niederlande_, i, 277, 278. It took more"
than ten years to bring Charles in good relations with the
Spaniards. See Mr. E. Armstrong's _Introduction_ to Major Martin
"Hume's _Spain_, 1898, pp. 31-37, 57, 76. Even in his latter years"
"they are found protesting against his customary absence from Spain,"
"and his perpetual wars. Robertson, bk. vi, p. 494. Cp. bk. xii,"
"vol. v, p. 417, as to the disregard shown him after his abdication."
"While it lasted, the Flemish exploitation of Spain was as shameless"
as the Spanish exploitation of Italy. The Italian Peter Martyr
"Angleria, residing at the court of Spain, reckoned that in ten"
months the Flemings there remitted home over a million ducats
"(Robertson, bk. i, p. 53). A lad, nephew of Charles's Flemish"
"minister Chievres, was appointed to the archbishopric of Toledo, in"
defiance of general indignation. The result was a clerico-popular
insurrection. Everything goes to show that but for the Emperor's
"prudence his Flemings would have ruined him in Spain, by getting"
"him to tyrannise for their gain, as Philip II later did for the"
Church's sake in the Netherlands.
It is not unwarrantable to say that had not Charles had the sagacity to
"adapt himself to the Spanish situation, learning to speak the language"
and even to tolerate the pride of the nobles[764] to a degree to which
"he never yielded before the claims of the burghers of the Netherlands,"
and had he not in the end identified himself chiefly with his Spanish
"interests, the history of Spain and the Netherlands might have been"
"entirely reversed. Had he, that is, kept his seat of rule in the"
"third, also in French, and bearing no signature, made an appointment to"
meet her in the English tea-shop in the Rue Royale on the following day
at five o'clock.
"That note, written upon plain paper of business appearance, had"
"apparently been left by hand.  Who, I wondered, was the person who had"
"made that appointment?  To me the writing seemed disguised, and"
"probably, owing to the thickness of the up-strokes, had been penned by a"
"male hand.  There was a mistake in the orthography, too, the word"
"""plaisir"" being written ""plasir.""  This showed plainly that no Frenchman"
had written it.
"I placed the letter in my pocket, and, encouraged by it, continued my"
investigations.
In the tiny letter-rack was a note which the unfortunate girl had
written immediately before being struck down.  It was addressed to
"""Baronne Maillac, Chateau des Grands Sablons, Seine et Marne.""  The"
little escritoire contained four small drawers; the contents of each I
"carefully scrutinised.  They were, however, mostly private letters of a"
social character--some from persons whom I knew well in Society.
"Suddenly, from the bottom of one of the smaller drawers, I drew forth"
several sheets of plain octavo paper of a pale yellow shade.  There
"were, perhaps, half-a-dozen sheets, carefully wrapped in a sheet of"
"plain blue foolscap.  I opened them, and, holding one up to the light,"
examined the water-mark.
Next instant the truth was plain.  That paper was the official paper
used in French Government offices for written reports.  How came it in
"her possession, if the accusation against her were untrue?"
"I held it in my hand, glaring at it in bewilderment.  Sheet by sheet I"
you to find what you want by looking for it. You ought to leave it a
little to chance.”
"“Abandon myself to events as they arrive? All right, it seems a good"
idea.”
"“Then if you find something practicable, utilize it.”"
Kennedy took his friend to a statue-shop where he used to pass some of
"his hours. The shop was in a lane near the Forum, and its stock was in"
"antiques, majolicas, and plaster casts of pagan gods."
"The shop was dark and rather gloomy, with a small court at the back"
"covered with vines. The proprietor was an old man, with a moustache,"
"an imperial, and a shock of white hair. His name was Giovanni Battista"
Lanza. He professed revolutionary ideas and had great enthusiasm about
Mazzini. He expressed himself in an ironical and malicious manner.
"Signora Vittoria, his wife, was a grumbling old woman, rather devoted to"
"wine. She spoke like a Roman of the lowest class, was olive-coloured and"
"wrinkled, and of her former beauty there remained only her very black"
eyes and hair that was still black.
"The daughter, Simonetta, a girl who resembled her father, blond, with"
"the build of a goddess, was the one that waited on customers and kept"
the accounts.
"Simonetta, being the manager, divided up the profits; the elder son was"
head of the workshop and he made the most money; then came two workmen
"from outside; and then the father who still got his day’s wages, out"
"of consideration for his age; and finally the younger son, twelve or"
"fourteen years old, who was an apprentice."
"as the work progressed, it seemed that good-fortune would never smile"
"upon them for long. One day, when their preparations were nearly"
"completed, a foreman came to Boyd, and said excitedly:"
"""Boss, I'd like you to look at the Iron Chinks right away."""
"""What's up?"""
"""I don't know, but something is wrong."" A hurried examination showed"
the machines to be cunningly crippled; certain parts were entirely
"missing, while others were broken."
"""They were all right when we brought them ashore,"" the man declared."
"""Somebody's been at them lately."""
"""When? How?"" questioned Boyd. ""We have had watchmen on guard all the"
"time. Have any strangers been about?"""
"""Nobody seems to know. When we got ready to set 'em just now, I saw"
"this."""
"The Iron Chink, or mechanical cleaner, is perhaps the most ingenious of"
the many labor-saving devices used in the salmon fisheries. It is an
"awkward-looking, yet very effective contrivance of revolving knives and"
"conveyors which seizes the fish whole and delivers it cleaned, clipped,"
"cut, and ready to be washed. With superhuman dexterity it does the work"
of twenty lightning-like butchers. Without the aid of these Iron
"Chinks, Boyd knew that his fish would spoil before they could be"
"handled. In a panic, he pursued his investigation far enough to realize"
that the machines were beyond repair; that what had seemed at first a
"trivial mishap was in fact an appalling disaster. Then, since his own"
"experience left him without resource, he hastened straightway to George"
"""Happen to know if he had any relations, sir?"""
"""H'm. He was a widower, I believe."""
"""Children?"""
"""Really,"" said Mr. Kilshaw, with a faint smile, ""I don't know."""
And he escaped from pertinacious Mr. Dawson with some alacrity. When he
"was outside, he stopped suddenly. ""Shall I tell 'em to apply to"
"Medland?"" he asked himself, with a malicious chuckle. ""No, I'll wait a"
"bit yet,"" and he walked on, wondering whether by any chance Mr. Benham"
had been done to death to save the Premier. This fanciful idea he soon
"dismissed with a laugh; it never entered his head, prejudiced as he was,"
"to think that Medland himself had any hand in the matter. After all, he"
"was a man of common sense, and he quickly arrived at a conclusion which"
"he expressed by exclaiming,"
"""The poor fool's been showing his money. Who's got my five hundred now,"
"I wonder?"""
"His wonderings would have been satisfied, had Aladdin's carpet or other"
magical contrivance transported him to where the steamship _Pride of the
"South_ was ploughing her way through the waves, bound from Kirton to San"
"Francisco, with liberty to touch at several South American ports. A"
"thick-set, short man, shipped at the last moment as cook's mate, in"
"substitution for a truant, was lying on his back, smoking a cigarette,"
"looking up at the bright stars, and ever and again gently pressing his"
hand on a little lump inside his shirt. He seemed at peace with all the
"world, though he was ready to be at war, if need be, and his knife,"
"burnished and clean, lay handy to his fingers. He turned on his side and"
"enough of the protocol translated by tomorrow, the press package ready."
Then we drop it on the papers and blow town.
"From the hallway outside a bell chimed faintly as the elevator opened,"
a private lift that came directly up from the lobby. When he heard the
"heavy footsteps of the couriers, accompanied by MNB guards, he stepped"
over and quickly glanced out. The two blue-suits were each carrying a
large satchel handcuffed to the left wrist. Obviously the third had
"stayed downstairs, guarding the van."
"""This way."" The heavy-jowled director of the MNB bond trading desk"
stepped out and motioned them in. The play was on.
Kenji Nogami's issue of Mino Industries debentures had been registered
with the Issuing House Association the previous day. This morning they
"would be acquired by Vance, using a wire transfer between the Moscow"
Narodny Bank on Saint Swithins Lane and Westminster Union Bank's bond
"desk. After that there would be a second transaction, whereby Sumitomo"
"Bank, Limited would accept the debentures as security for a loan of one"
"hundred million dollars, to be wire-transferred back to Westminster"
Union and from there to Moscow Narodny Bank. Everything had been
prearranged. The whole transaction would require only minutes.
Unless there was a glitch.
Vance had fully expected that Tanzan Mino would send a welcoming
"committee to Nogami's premises, which was why he'd arranged for the"
money to be delivered here at Moscow Narodny's side-street branch. He
"figured the Soviets, at least, would play it straight. KGB wanted its"
file closed.
"Then too, Eva still had the protocol. Their back-up insurance policy."
"“Lady from the Stenographer’s Agency to see about the position,” said"
Pitcher.
"Maxwell turned half around, with his hands full of papers and ticker"
tape.
"“What position?” he asked, with a frown."
"“Position of stenographer,” said Pitcher. “You told me yesterday to"
call them up and have one sent over this morning.”
"“You are losing your mind, Pitcher,” said Maxwell. “Why should I have"
given you any such instructions? Miss Leslie has given perfect
satisfaction during the year she has been here. The place is hers as
"long as she chooses to retain it. There’s no place open here, madam."
"Countermand that order with the agency, Pitcher, and don’t bring any"
more of ’em in here.”
"The silver heart left the office, swinging and banging itself"
independently against the office furniture as it indignantly departed.
Pitcher seized a moment to remark to the bookkeeper that the “old man”
seemed to get more absent-minded and forgetful every day of the world.
The rush and pace of business grew fiercer and faster. On the floor
they were pounding half a dozen stocks in which Maxwell’s customers
were heavy investors. Orders to buy and sell were coming and going as
swift as the flight of swallows. Some of his own holdings were
"imperilled, and the man was working like some high-geared, delicate,"
"strong machine—strung to full tension, going at full speed, accurate,"
"never hesitating, with the proper word and decision and act ready and"
"prompt as clockwork. Stocks and bonds, loans and mortgages, margins and"
"securities—here was a world of finance, and there was no room in it for"
"splendid aim, rebounded from the staff-paymaster's shiny pate."
"""The ship's company will have to make up the loss,"" he muttered."
"""They're responsible for their confounded pet."""
"""But you're responsible for the money, Staggles,"" remarked the"
"commander drily. ""At any rate, Mephisto is paying you back by"
"instalments."""
It wanted all the self-control at their command to keep the lookout
"men's attention from the comic scene to a duty of a serious nature,"
while the gun's crews temporarily forgot their duties to watch the
encounter between the mascot and the staff-paymaster.
"""Catch it--oh, you rotten butterfingers!"" groaned the accountant"
"officer to the assistant-paymaster, who, missing a coin thrown by the"
"animal, allowed the sum of one penny to be committed to the deep."
"""Here, ship's steward, nip below and open a tin of condensed. That"
"may tempt the brute below."""
"""You're condoning an offence, Staggles,"" said the commander in an"
"undertone, with a humorous gleam in his eye."
Another coin tinkled on the deck. The commander promptly placed his
foot on it to check its career towards the side.
"""Where did that go?"" asked the staff-paymaster, who, curiously"
"enough, had a miserly regard for any money except his own, which he"
spent liberally.
The commander shifted his foot and pointed to the retrieved coin; as
"he did so, another penny, hurtling through the air, hit him smartly"
CHAPTER LXXXVI
"_Wherein our Hero, and Another, go Home_"
The sunlight that had painted the white face of Paris with a hundred
hues all day had given place to a gentle drizzle as the twilight fell;
and the steady downpour had driven Noll into a restaurant which he was
not in the habit of frequenting; it had kept him there in its bright
rooms until he knew every face and every trick of gesture of the people
who sat about him.
The night was well advanced when he sallied out into the light rain;
"turning up his collar, he strode homewards."
He paid small heed to the rain; and as he turned out of the well-washed
"street into the courtyard where he had his lodging, and climbed the"
"stairs to his room, he scarcely noticed that he was wet."
"The rustle of women’s petticoats was in his ears, and when he walked"
abroad in these days he was aglow with the sense of the warm regard
"of women’s eyes, that glanced upon him from the dark shadows of"
rakish hats; the walk and movement of women found a rhythmic echo in
his thinking. The warmth of the coming summer was in his blood. His
instincts were jigging to the dancing measure of the season.
As he flung off his wet clothes he was seized with a whim to go to the
tavern of _The Golden Sun_; and he decided to humour the whim.
He lit a candle and flipped through a book until it was close on
midnight. But he was restless--and he arose eagerly when it was time to
breath. She knew it was over the price to be paid for her that they were
"disputing, but that knowledge had ceased to be any novelty. The wrathful"
voices of the two disputants seemed to come from a great distance. She
felt as if the whole affair were a dream from which she might at any
moment awake on board the _Olive Branch_ again.
"""There isn't money enough in it to pay you so much for a mere"
"affidavit,"" she heard Slyne say, and Mr. Jobling, under his glance,"
confirmed that statement emphatically.
"""A hundred and twenty-one thousand is the last limit--a thousand down,"
"to bind the bargain, and the balance the day of my wedding with Sallie,"""
"Slyne declared. ""If that doesn't satisfy you--there's nothing more to be"
"said. And I'll maybe find other means--"""
"""Show me even the first thousand,"" requested Captain Dove, and Slyne"
"counted out on to the table, at a safe distance from the old man's"
"twitching fingers, five thousand francs of the amount Lord Ingoldsby had"
paid him for his car.
"""All right,"" said Captain Dove gruffly, and snatched at the notes. But"
Slyne picked them up again.
"""As soon as you've given Jobling your statement,"" he said, ""and signed"
"whatever other documents he may think necessary, I'll hand you these and"
"my note of hand, endorsed by him, for the balance remaining due you."""
Mr. Jobling picked up a pen and Slyne pushed a sheet of foolscap toward
"him. Captain Dove, with a grunt of disgust, sat back in his chair and,"
"while the lawyer wrote rapidly, related how he had found Sallie."
"When he had finished, Mr. Jobling read his statement over aloud, and"
"“If you go on in this way,” said Herold, “you 'll soon have as much idea"
of what's going on in London as a lonely dog tied up in a kennel.”
"“What does it matter,” growled John, “to any of the besotted fools who"
"read newspapers, provided I bark loud enough?”"
"There was one thing going on in London, however, in which he took a grim"
"interest, and that was the convalescence of the little maid-of-all-work"
"who had been taken back, a maimed lamb, to the cheerless fold where"
she had been reared. Thither he went to make inquiries as soon as he
returned from Southcliff-on-Sea. He found the Orphanage of St. Martha
"at Willesden, a poverty-stricken building, a hopeless parallelogram of"
"dingy, yellow brick, standing within a walled inclosure. There were no"
"trees or flowers, for the yard was paved. His ring at the front door was"
"answered by an orphan in a light print dress, her meagre hair clutched"
up tight in a knob at the back. He asked for the superintendent and
"handed his card. The orphan conducted him to a depressing parlour, and"
"vanished. Presently appeared a thin, weary woman, dressed in the black"
"robes of a Sister of Mercy, who, holding the card tight in nervous"
"fingers, regarded him with an air of mingled fright and defiance."
“Your business?” she asked.
"Despite the torture of it all, John could not help smiling. If he had"
"been armed with a knout, his reception could not have been more hostile."
"“I must beg of you to believe,” said he, “that I come as a friend and"
not as an enemy.”
She pointed to a straight-backed chair.
"of Arthur, and again from the Chorus (which closes the acts, as in"
_Gorboduc_) we learn the great purpose beneath this overwhelming ruin of
"a king and kingdom--to show that the day and the hour do come, however"
"long deferred, when"
"Wrong hath his wreak, and guilt his guerdon bears."
"As before, all action is rigorously excluded from the stage, to be"
"reported, at great length and with tremendous striving after vividness"
"and effect, by one who was present. Dumb Shows before each act continue"
the attempt to balance matters spectacularly. Clearly the only hope of
dramatic advance for disciples of the Senecan school lay in improved
"dialogue. This was possible in four directions, namely, in more stirring"
"topics, in more personal feeling, in shorter speeches, and in a change"
"in the style of language and verse. Unfortunately for Thomas Hughes, it"
"is just here that he fails, and fails lamentably. What is more, he fails"
because of his methods. The dominant desire of the English 'classical'
school was to be impressive. Hence the adoption by Hughes of a ghostly
"introduction and conclusion. His conversations, therefore, must reflect"
"the same idea. He saw, indeed, that long speeches, except at rare"
"intervals, were tedious, and reduced his to reasonable proportions, even"
"making extensive use--as, we shall see, the author of _Damon and"
Pythias_ did before him--of the Greek device of stichomythia. He was
"most anxious, also, to provide stirring topics for his characters to"
MONTENEGRO.

"Nathaniel Hawthorne, in his _Marble Faun_, which, by the way, contains"
"the most charming of all the descriptive writing about Rome, put"
"the case none too strongly when he spoke of being ""disgusted with"
"the pretense of holiness and the reality of nastiness, each equally"
"omnipresent"" in the city of the popes. The new government has wrought"
"a great change in this respect, and Rome is in many parts of it now"
quite a clean city.
"There, then, are the facts as to the influence of the Roman Catholic"
"Church. I am, of course, very far from saying that there are no good"
"people in that church. As I have already stated, I believe that there"
"are many good people in it, but my own observation has satisfied me"
that the verdict of history as to the baleful influence of the system
is absolutely correct.
"""What, then,"" some one may ask, ""do the good people in that church"
think of all the immoralities and frauds that it has condoned and
"fostered?"" The answer is that the really good people in that church"
must grieve over them and deplore them just as the good people in other
churches do.

"_P. S._--It is generally believed, and apparently with good reason,"
"that the new Pope, Pius X., is a better man than many of his"
"predecessors, and that he cannot be charged with the immoralities or"
the ambition and avarice which characterized them. Let us hope that he
will have the courage to attempt some real reform in the lives of many
of his clergy.
FOOTNOTES:
"food than the mists of his own dreaming. However, it was different"
"when,--pausing before each word after the manner of a child,--she came"
"to a passage of the poet's, and read:"
"""'In that moment I say most truly that the spirit of life, which hath"
"its dwelling in the most secret chambers of the heart, began to tremble"
"so violently that the least pulse of my body shook herewith, and in the"
"trembling it said these words: ""Here is a deity stronger than I who,"
"coming shall rule over me.""'"""
"At that the Girl let the book fall and, going down on her knees and"
"taking both his hands in hers, she raised to him a look so full of"
adoring worship that he felt himself awed before it.
"""That 'ere Dante ain't so far off after all. I know jest how he feels."
"Oh, I ain't fit to read to you, to talk to you, to kiss you."""
"Nevertheless, he saw to it that she did."
"After this he told her about the Inferno, and she listened eagerly to"
"his description of the unfortunate characters, though she declared, when"
"he explained some of the crimes that they had committed, that they ""Got"
"only what was rightly comin' to them."""
The patient could hardly suppress his amusement. Dante was discarded and
instead they told each other how much love there was in that little
cabin on Cloudy Mountain.
The days that followed were all much like this one. Food was brought up
"from The Polka and, by degrees, the patient's strength came back. And it"
was but natural that he became so absorbed in his newly-found happiness
"that he gradually was losing all sense of danger. Late one night,"
"months of German occupation, though Vivie, in her solitude at"
"Tervueren, seldom heard them."
After her business at the bank she walked about the town. No one
took any notice of her or annoyed her in any way. The restaurants
"seemed crowded with Belgians as well as Germans, and the Belgians"
did not seem to have lost their appetites. The Palace Hotel had
become a German officers' club. On all the public buildings the
German Imperial flag hung alongside the Belgian. Only a few of the
"trams were running. Yet you could still buy, without much difficulty"
"at the kiosques, Belgian and even French and British newspapers."
From these she gathered that the German forces were in imminent
peril between the Belgian Antwerp army on the north and the British
army advancing from the south; and that in the plains of Alsace the
"French had given the first public exhibition of the new ""Turpin"""
explosive. The results had been _foudroyant_ ... and simple.
Complete regiments of German soldiers had been destroyed in _one
"minute_. It seemed curious, she thought, that with such an arm as"
this the French command did not at once come irresistibly to the
rescue of Brussels....
"However, it was four o'clock, and there was her friend the enemy's"
"automobile drawn up outside the bank, awaiting her. She got in, and"
"the soldier chauffeur whirled her away to the Villa Beau-séjour,"
beyond Tervueren.
On her return she found her mother prostrate with bad news. Their
"nearest neighbour, Farmer Oudekens who had driven them into Brussels"
the preceding day had been executed in his own orchard only an hour
ago. It seemed that the lieutenant in charge of the soldiers
"billeted there had disappeared in the night, leaving his uniform and"
watch and chain behind him. The farmer's story was that in the night
spirit?”
"“If it's as you say, it's uncanny,” said Risca, unconvinced."
Yet when Sir Oliver and Julia both assured him that Stella never doubted
"his luxurious happiness, and that the ordering of the picture was due to"
"no subtle suggestion, he had to believe them."
"“You always make the mistake, John, of thinking Stellamaris mortal,”"
"said Herold, at the supper-table, for, on receipt of the young men's"
"telegram, the Blounts had deferred their dinner to the later hour of"
"supper. “You are utterly wrong,” said he. “How can she be mortal when"
she talks all day to winds and clouds and the sea-children in their cups
"of foam? She's as elemental as Ariel. When she sleeps, she's really away"
on a sea-gull's back to the Isles of Magic. That's why she laughs at the
"dull, clumsy old world from which she is cut off in her mortal guise."
What are railway-trains and omnibuses to her? What would they be to
"you, John, if you could have a sea-gull's back whenever you wanted to go"
"anywhere? And she goes to places worth going to, by George! What could"
she want with Charing Cross or the Boulevard des Italians? Fancy the
nymph Syrinx at a woman writers' dinner!”
"“I don't know what you 're talking about, Walter,” said Lady Blount,"
whose mind was practical.
"“Syrinx,” said Sir Oliver, oracularly (he was a little, shrivelled man,"
to whose weak face a white moustache and an imperial gave a false air
"of distinction)--“Syrinx,” said he, “was a nymph beloved of Pan,--it's a"
"common legend in Greek mythology,--and Pan turned her into a reed.”"
"“And then cut the reed up into Pan-pipes,” cried Herold, eagerly, “and"
made immortal music out of them--just as he makes immortal music out of
since in neither case were the abdominal symptoms a prominent
feature.

"(Mauser) perforated the right forearm, then entered belly."
"_Entry_, 3 inches from the right anterior superior iliac spine,"
in the line of the supra-pubic fold of the belly wall (a
"transverse slit); _exit_, in right buttock, on a level with the"
tip of the great trochanter and 2 inches within it. The wound
was received immediately after breakfast had been eaten. There
"was retention of urine and constipation for three days, but no"
"sickness. Local pain and tenderness were severe, and at the end"
"of three weeks there was still local tenderness, slight"
"induration, and dragging pain on defæcation. The patient"
"returned to England at the end of a month well, except for"
slight local tenderness.
(185) _Possible wound of colon._--Wounded at Paardeberg; range
200 yards. Walking at time. The bullet (Mauser) perforated the
"left forearm, just below the elbow-joint. _Entry_, into belly 1"

no exit.
The injury was followed by pain in the left half of the abdomen
"and vomiting, which continued for two days. The bowels acted on"
"the third day; no nourishment was taken for two days, but a"
small quantity of water was allowed. No further symptoms were
"noted, and at the end of a fortnight the patient was well,"
except for slight local tenderness. The bullet could not be
detected with the X-rays.
(186) _Wound of cæcum_.--Wounded at Paardeberg. _Entry_
"Kennedy went to look at a picture by Sassoferrato, which is in one of"
"the chapels, and meanwhile the rosary-seller showed the church door to"
"Cæsar and explained the different bas-reliefs, cut in cypress wood by"
"Greek artists of the V Century, and representing scenes from the Old and"
New Testaments.
"Kennedy came back, they got into the carriage again, and they drove to"
the Benedictine abbey.
“Is the abbot Hildebrandus here?” asked Kennedy.
"Out came the abbot, a man of about fifty, with a gold cross on his"
"breast. They exchanged a few friendly words, and the superior showed"
them the convent.
The refectory was clean and very spacious; the long table of shining
"wood; the floor made of mosaic. The crypt held a statue, which Cæsar"
"assumed must be of Sant’ Anselmo. The church was severe, without"
"ornaments, without pictures; it had a primitive air, with its columns of"
"fine granite that looked like marble. A monk was playing the harmonium,"
"and in the opaque veiled light, the thin music gave a strange impression"
of something quite outside this life.
Afterwards they crossed a large court with palm-trees. They went up to
"the second story, and down a corridor with cells, each of which had on"
the lintel the name of the patron saint of the respective monk. Each
door had a card with the name of the occupant of the room.
It looked more like a bath-house than a monastery. The cells were
"comfortable inside, without any air of sadness; each held a bed, a"
"divan, and a small bookcase."
"Vance's attention, however, was riveted on what awaited at the end of"
"the stony walkway. It was a traditional teahouse, set in a grove of"
flowering azaleas. And standing in the doorway was a silver-haired
figure dressed in a formal black kimono. He was beckoning.
"""Did I neglect to tell you I prefer Japanese _cha-no-yu _to the usual"
"British afternoon tea?"" Tanzan Mino announced. ""It is a ritual designed"
"to renew the spirit, to cleanse the mind. It goes back hundreds of"
"years. I always enjoy it in the afternoon, and I find it has"
marvelously restorative powers. This seemed the ideal occasion for us
"to meet and chat."""
"""Don't want to slight tradition."" Vance slipped on the pair of wooden"
clogs that awaited at the bottom of the path.
"""My feelings entirely,"" the CEO continued, smiling as he watched him"
"approach. ""You understand the Japanese way, Dr. Vance, which is one"
"reason we have so much to discuss."""
He bowed a greeting as Vance deposited his clogs on the stepping stone
by the teahouse door. Together they stooped to enter.
A light murmur of boiling water came from a brazier set into the
"_tatami_-matted floor, but otherwise the room was caught in an ethereal"
"silence. The decor was more modern than most teahouses, with fresh"
cedar and pine for the ceiling and walls rather than the customary
"reed, bark, and bamboo."
Tanzan Mino gestured for him to sit opposite as he immediately began
"the formalities of ritually cleaning the bamboo scoop, then elevating"
the rugged white tea bowl like an ancient chalance and ceremonially
"""I do not think that he regards them at all! He has scarcely looked at"
"one of them ever since I first knew him."""
"Sergeant Cardono groaned, seemingly greatly perturbed in spirit."
"""I feared as much,"" he said, shaking his head; ""he hath not the right"
"wandering eye. Now, that young Frenchman is a devil untamed! And the"
"Englishman--well, though he is deeper, he also hath it in him. But the"
colonel is all for fighting and his duty. It is easy to see that he will
rise but little higher. When was there ever a great soldier without a
"weakness for a pretty woman and a good dinner? Why, the thing is"
"against nature. Now, my father fought in the War of the Independence,"
and the tales that he told of El Gran' Lor'--he was a soldier if you
"like, worthy of the white plumes! A cook all to himself closer at his"
"elbow than an aide-de-camp--and as to the women--ah----!"""
Sergeant Cardono nodded as one who could tell tales and he would. Yet
the Sergeant Cardono found some reason to change his mind as to Rollo's
qualifications for field-officership before the end of their first day
apart from Cabrera.
It was indeed with a feeling of intense relief that the little company
of five men separated from the white and red _boinas_ of the
butcher-general's cavalcade. Well-affected to them as Cabrera might be
"for the time being, his favour was so brief and uncertain, his affection"
"so tiger-like, that even Sergeant Cardono sighed a sigh of satisfaction"
when they turned their horses' heads towards the far-away Guadarrama
beyond which lay the goal of their adventuring.
Presently the tongues of the little cavalcade were unloosed. El Sarria
"and Sergeant Cardono having found subjects of common interest, communed"
Rollo coloured high.
"""General,"" he said, ""I will not conceal it from you that I have wasted"
too much time already; but if you wish for our assistance in your
"designs for twenty-four hours, I am not the man to deny you."""
"""I thought not,"" cried Cabrera, much pleased. ""And now have you any"
"business to despatch before we leave this place? If so, let it be seen"
"to at once!"""
"""None, Excellency,"" said Rollo, ""save that if you are satisfied of our"
good faith I should like to see Luis Fernandez the miller dealt with
"according to his deserts!"""
"""I will have him shot instantly,"" cried Cabrera; ""he hath given false"
tidings to his Majesty's generals. He hath belied his honest servants.
"Guard, bring Luis Fernandez hither!"""
This was rather more than Rollo had bargained for. He was not yet
"accustomed to the summary methods of Cabrera, even though the butcher's"
hand had hardly yet unclosed from himself. He was already meditating an
"appeal in favour of milder measures, when the guard returned with the"
"news that Luis Fernandez was nowhere to be found. Dwelling-house,"
"strong-room, mill, garden, and gorge beneath--all had been searched. In"
vain--they were empty and void. The tumbled beds where the general and
"his staff had slept, the granary with its trampled heaps of corn ready"
"for grinding, the mill-wheel with the pool beneath where the lights and"
"shadows played at bo-peep, where the trout lurked and the water-boxes"
seemed to descend into an infinity of blackness--all were deserted and
lonesome as if no man had been near them for a hundred years.
"""The rascal has escaped!"" cried Cabrera, full of rage; ""have I not told"
"Let's see what our surroundings look like."""
"They walked to the nearest window-aperture, and gazed out on a"
startling and marvelous scene.
*       *       *       *       *
"Beneath their high tower window, extending as far as the eye could"
"reach, lay the city, lit by the reddish glare of the peculiar metal"
with which its streets were paved. For the most part the metropolis
consisted of perfectly square buildings pierced by many windows to
indicate that each housed a large number of inmates. But here and
"there grotesque turrets lanced the sky, and symbolic domes arched"
above the surrounding flat metal roofs.
One building in particular they noticed. This was an enormous
structure in the shape of a half-globe that reared its spherical
height less than an eighth of a mile from the building they were in.
"It was situated off to their right at the foot of a vast, high-walled"
enclosure whose near end seemed to be formed by the right wall of
their prison. They could only see it by leaning far out of the
window; and it would not have come to their attention at all had they
"not heard it first--or, rather, heard the sound of something within"
it: for from it came a curious whining hum that never varied in
"intensity, something like the hum of a gigantic dynamo, only greater"
and of a more penetrating pitch.
"""Sounds as though it might be some sort of central power station,"""
"said Brand. ""But what could it supply power for?"""
"""Give it up,"" said Dex. ""For their damned shock-tubes, perhaps, among"
"other things--"""
"“Thank you--Curly,” Bainbridge said in a level voice. “That was"
touch-and-go for a minute.”
"That was all, but somehow Curly knew that what he had done was"
understood and appreciated. In the stress of the peril which the two had
"shared shoulder to shoulder like common brother river hogs, Kollock’s"
anger and hate had vanished utterly. He no longer desired revenge. His
attitude of a scant half hour before seemed small and mean and petty. He
"had saved the life of the man his brother wanted out of the way, and,"
"given the opportunity, he would do it as promptly again."
CHAPTER XIII. THE LIMIT
Curly Kollock’s interest and liking for his boss grew stronger day after
day. There was something about Bob Bainbridge which stirred the finer
"qualities in his nature, and brought twinges of shame to the young"
riverman whenever he thought how near he had come to throwing his lot
with his brother. If Bill ever showed up he resolved to tell him just
"what he thought of him, too. But in the meantime, not being much of a"
"penman, he made no effort to answer the letter. It was sufficient that"
he considered himself cut loose from the whole miserable bunch. If they
were expecting aid from him in their plotting they were doomed to
disappointment.
"More and more often as they descended the Katahdin River, the boy was"
stirred to anger at the constant succession of moves made by that gang
of crooks against the man who fought them practically alone and
singlehanded.
Along the river were several dams placed for the purpose of regulating
the head of water and facilitating the process of driving. They belonged
they had nothing to fear. He was sorry the soldiers had helped
themselves so freely to the livestock; but everything had now
"settled down. Henceforth they would be sure of something to eat, as"
he himself had got to be fed. And all he asked of them was their
agreeable society.
"Two months went by of this strange life. Two months, in which Vivie"
only saw German newspapers--which she read with the aid of von
Giesselin. Their contents filled her with despair. They made very
"little of the Marne rebuff, much of the capture of Antwerp and"
"Ostende, and the occupation of all Belgium (as they put it). Vivie"
noted that the German Emperor's heart had bled for the punishment
"inflicted on Louvain. (She wondered how that strange personality,"
"her father, had fared in the destruction of monastic buildings.) But"
"she had then no true idea of what had taken place, and the"
far-reaching harm this crime had done to the German reputation. She
noted that the German Press expressed disappointment that the cause
"of Germany, the crusade against Albion, had received no support from"
"the Irish Nationalists, or from the ""revolting"" women, the"
"Suffragettes, who had been so cruelly maltreated by the"
administration of Asquith and Sir Grey.
"This point was discussed by the Colonel, but Vivie found herself"
speaking as a patriot. How _could_ the Germans expect British women
to turn against their own country in its hour of danger?
"""Then you would not,"" said von Giesselin, ""consent to write some"
"letters to your friends, if I said I could have them sent safely to"
"their destination?--only letters,"" he added hastily, seeing her"
"nostrils quiver and a look come into her eyes--""to ask your Suffrage"
friends to bring pressure to bear on their Government to bring this
"d-r-r-eadful War to a just peace. That is all we ask."" But Vivie"
"“Well,” Ned suggested, “we’d better wait here a little while, until"
"things get quieted down, and then make a break for the passage.”"
"“All right,” Jimmie said with an air of resignation, “I’ll crawl back"
here in the corner and try to imagine that I’m in charge of a pie wagon
on Third avenue. Perhaps I can dream a pie or two!”
The boy leaned back in an angle of the chamber and prepared to continue
the discussion regarding the different kinds of pies sold at the old
"Williams street corner. As he did so, the support of his back gave way,"
"his heels flew up in the air, and he tumbled all of a heap into a"
passage which seemed to begin at that corner of the room.
Hearing the fall and the exclamation of impatience which came from the
"boy’s lips, Ned turned on the electric and saw Jimmie lying on his back"
in a tunnel probably a yard in size each way. There were plenty of
indications that the tunnel had been cut through solid rock.
"As far as Ned could see; that is, as far as the eye of the electric"
carried; there were no breaks in it. Directly a chill breeze blew in
"from the opening, and the boy knew that the passage touched the surface"
of the mountain not far away.
"“Je-rusalem!” shouted Jimmie, “hold up the light and let me see if I’m"
all here. That’s the second tumble I’ve got in this consarned old hole
today.”
"“If every tumble you get in life brings such results as this,” Ned"
"declared, “you ought to go around the world looking for tumbles!”"
"“They hurt, just the same!” Jimmie declared, rubbing the back of his"
head. “I got an awful bump on my coco!”
"to them was barred. For a long, dull period the voyagers lay as"
"helpless as if in dry-dock, while wandering herds of seals barked at"
them or bands of walruses ceased their fishing and crept out upon the
ice-pans to observe these invaders of their peace. When an opportunity
"at last presented itself, they threaded their way southward, there to"
"try another approach, and another, and another, until the first of May"
"had come and gone, leaving them but little closer to their goal than"
when they first hove-to. Late one evening they discerned smoke on the
"horizon, and the next morning's light showed a three-masted steamship"
"fast in the ice, a few miles to the westward."
"""That's _The Juliet_,"" Big George informed his companions, ""one of the"
"North American Packers' Association tenders."""
"""She was loading when we left Seattle,"" Boyd remarked."
"""It is Willis Marsh's ship, so he must be aboard,"" supplemented Cherry."
"""She's a wooden ship, and built for this business. If we don't look out"
"he'll beat us in, after all."""
"""What good will that do him?"" Clyde questioned. ""The fish don't bite--I"
"mean run--for sixty days yet."""
Emerson and Balt merely shrugged.
To Cherry Malotte this had been a voyage of dreams; for once away from
"land, Boyd had become his real self again--that genial, irrepressible"
self she had seen but rarely--and his manner had lost the restraint and
coolness which recently had disturbed their relations. Of necessity
"their cramped environment had thrown them much together, and their"
companionship had been most pleasant. She and Boyd had spent long hours
"together, during which his light-heartedness had rivalled that of Alton"
"them."""
Here a knock at the door interrupted the conversation. The servant
"entered, bringing a note gorgeously crested and coroneted in gold."
"Villiers, to whom it was addressed, opened and read it."
"""What shall we do about this?"" he asked, when his man had retired. ""It"
is an invitation from the Duchess de la Santoisie. She asks us to go
"and dine with her next week,--a party of twenty--reception afterward. I"
"think we'd better accept,--what do you say?"""
"Alwyn roused himself from his reverie. ""Anything to please you, my dear"
"boy!"" he answered cheerfully--""But I haven't the faintest idea who the"
"Duchess de la Santoisie is!"""
"""No? ... Well, she's an Englishwoman who has married a French Duke. He"
"is a delightful old fellow, the pink of courtesy, and the model of"
"perfect egotism. A true Parisian, and of course an atheist,--a very"
"polished atheist, too, with a most charming reliance on his own"
infallibility. His wife writes novels which have a SLIGHT leaning
"toward Zolaism,--she is an extremely witty woman sarcastic, and"
"cold-blooded enough to be a female Robespierre, yet, on the whole,"
amusing as a study of what curious nondescript forms the feminine
"nature can adopt unto itself, if it chooses. She has an immense respect"
"for GENIUS,--mind, I say genius advisedly, because she really is one of"
those rare few who cannot endure mediocrity. Everything at her house is
"the best of its kind, and the people she entertains are the best of"
theirs. Her welcome of you will be at any rate a sincerely admiring
"one,--and as I think, in spite of your desire for quiet, you will have"
"to show yourself somewhere, it may as well be there."""
"Alwyn looked dubious, and not at all resigned to the prospect of"
"aware--the garlic--the onions--we of this country love them?"""
"""But so do I,"" cried Rollo, ""and I will not have distinctions made on"
this expedition. We are all to risk our lives equally and we shall all
"fare equally, and if we are caught our dose of lead or halter-hemp will"
"be just the same."""
Here El Sarria interrupted.
"""With respect,"" he said, ""it is true that this gentleman hath some"
private matters to communicate to me which have nothing to do with the
object of our mission. I crave your permission that for to-day I may
"dine apart with him!"""
After this there was no more to be said. El Sarria helped the sergeant
"to serve the meal, which was at once the proof of his foraging ability"
"and his consummate genius as a cook. For though the day was Friday, the"
soup was very far from _maigre_. The stew contained both lamb and fresh
pork cut into generous cubes with a sufficiency of savoury fat included.
A sausage had been sliced small for seasoning and the whole had been so
"smothered in _garbanzos_, haricot beans, rice, mixed with strips of"
"toothsome salt fish, that John Mortimer bent and said a well-deserved"
blessing over the viands.
"""I don't usually in this country,"" he explained, ""but really this is"
what my good old father would call a manifest providence. That fellow of
"ours will prove a treasure."""
"""It seems so,"" said Rollo, a little grimly, ""that is, if he can scout"
"and fight as well as he can cater and cook."""
"For himself the young Scot cared little what he ate, and would have"
"""And lots and lots of love, father,"" interrupted Betty."

"Well, our journey was soon arranged on a grand scale. Pickering lent us"
"his new coach, just home from the makers in Cow Street. It was cushioned"
and curtained and had springs in place of thorough-braces. It also had
glass in the windows and doors; a luxury then little known in England
even among the nobles. There was a prejudice against its use in coach
windows because of the fact that two or three old ladies had cut their
faces in trying to thrust their heads through it.
"The new coach was a wonderful vehicle, and Frances and I, as well as"
"Betty, were very proud of our grandeur. Pickering sent along with the"
"coach and horses two lusty fellows as drivers, and gave us a hamper"
almost large enough to feed a company of soldiers. I was to pay all
expenses on the road.
"Almost at the last hour Sir Richard concluded not to go, but insisted"
"that Frances, Bettina, and I take the journey by ourselves. As Pickering"
"offered no objection, Frances shrugged her shoulders in assent, I"
"shrugged mine, and Betty laughed, whereby we all, in our own way, agreed"
"to the new arrangement, and preparations went forward rapidly."
"By the time we were ready to start, the king, the duke, the duchess, and"
"many ladies and gentlemen of the court circle had gone to Bath, thus"
giving us an opportunity to make our journey without the knowledge of any
one in Whitehall; a consideration of vast importance to us under the
circumstances. Some of our grand friends at court might have laughed at
"our taking the journey with an innkeeper's daughter, in an innkeeper's"
"coach, but Frances and I laughed because we were happy."
"the evil hordes from beyond the stars ..."""
The Vice-President looked around in a daze. Had someone forgotten to
brief him? Had that project come to a head overnight? The last he'd
heard there had been much doubt as to--
""" ... The injustice perpetrated on the American people in this matter"
has been monstrous. And this is not because of any lack of knowledge on
the part of the government. It has been because of the petty natures of
the men to whom this secret has been entrusted. Jealousies have dictated
policy where selfless public service was of the most vital importance
"..."""
The floor was filling up. The visitor's gallery was wrapped in hushed
"silence. Newsmen, informed of sensational developments, were rushing"
down corridors.
And the Vice-President was wondering why he hadn't had the good sense to
refuse the nomination.
""" ... These invaders from another planet are not strangers to the men in"
power. It is on record that they are inhuman monsters capable of killing

"manufactured to destroy us, by a race so far ahead of us in scientific"

girl anyway--so much for Pola's education. And culture--what benefited
all the culture of Europe if Pola found enjoyment only in the company
of youths her mother would not permit in the house?
"Pola mistook Sidney's silence for hurt. ""You goose, I'm not saying I"
think I'm any better than _you_ are! But you must see that neither of
"us are a bit like that native girl!"" Which admission Pola considered"
most generous.
"""I wasn't thinking about whether you are any better than I am or not."
"I've been brought up, you see,"" with a rueful laugh, ""to believe that"
my father being a poet set _me_ a little apart from everyone else. And
I've hated it. What I was thinking was that there really isn't any
"class difference in people--except what we make ourselves, like the"
League building a barrier around me and you thinking you're in another
class from Mart because you're rich. Maybe it isn't really the outside
"things that count, maybe it's the big things we have got or haven't got"
"inside us--"""
"""Like what?"" demanded Pola."
Sidney was thinking of Lav's self-effacing ambition to serve the world
"from the seclusion of a laboratory, of Mart's cheerfulness in the face"
of her lot and her loyal affection for her exacting and rheumatic
"grandmother; of the courage of Mart's grandfather, Ambrose Calkins, who"
had lost his own life in going back to his sinking schooner for the
"cook who could not swim; of her own ancestor, Priscilla Ellis. _Those_"
"were the things which set people apart from their fellows, Sidney"
"thought, but the understanding was too new in her own heart for her to"
"find words in which she could tell Pola of it. ""Like what?"" Pola"
demanded again and this time her voice was a little haughty.
a translation of an account of the payments for kaloma making.
ACCOUNT OF THE KALOMA MAKING
Supposing some man from inland lives in Kiriwina or in Luba
or in one of the villages nearby; he wants a katudababile. He
would request an expert fisherman who knows how to dive for
"kaloma. This man agrees; he dives, he dives ... till it is"
"sufficient; his vataga (large folding basket) is already full,"
"this man (the inlander) hears the rumour; he, the master of the"
"kaloma (that is, the man for whom the necklace will be made) says:"
"""Good! I shall just have a look!"" He would come, he would see,"
he would not give any vakapula payment. He (here the Sinaketan
"diver is meant) would say: ""Go, tomorrow, I shall break the shell,"
"come here, give me vakapula."" Next day, he (the inlander) would"
"cook food, he would bring, he would give vakapula; he (the diver)"
"would break the shell. Next day, the same. He (the inlander) would"
"give the vakapula, he (the diver) would break the shell. Supposing"
"the breaking is already finished, he (the diver) would say:"
"""Good! already the breaking is finished, I shall polish."" Next"
"day, he (the inlander) would cook food, would bring bananas,"
"coco-nut, betel-nut, sugar cane, would give it as vakapula;"
"this man (the diver) polishes. The polishing already finished,"
"he would speak: ""Good! To-morrow I shall drill."" This man (the"
"inlander) would bring food, bananas, coco-nuts, sugar cane,"
"he would give it as vakapula: it would be abundant, for soon"
"already the necklace will be finished. The same, he would give a"
"big vakapula on the occasion of the rounding up of the cylinder,"
"for soon everything will be finished. When finished, we thread it"
"on a string, we wash it. (Note the change from the third singular"
"into the first plural). We give it to our wife, we blow the conch"
A suite of rooms received them in the quiet West End hotel where the
"Canon always stayed. They dined alone, the discreet butler waiting on"
"them, for the Canon was an honoured guest. When the cloth was removed,"
the Canon said in his even voice:--
"“Are you sufficiently recovered, Yvonne, to discuss this painful"
subject?”
"“I am quite ready, Everard.”"
“We will make it as short as possible. What I said last night must
"remain, whatever be the suffering. I have loved you deeply--like a young"
"man--in a way perhaps ill befitting my years. The memories, for they are"
"innocent, will always be there, Yvonne. If I did not seek strength from"
"Elsewhere, it might wreck my life to part from you.”"
A young teacher was telling her pupils the story of the emotional lady
"who, to put her lover to the test, bade him pick up the glove which"
she had thrown down into the arena between the tiger and the lion. The
"lover does her bidding, in order to vindicate his character as a brave"
"knight. One boy, after hearing the story, at once states his contempt"
"for the knight's acquiescence, which he declares to be unworthy."
"“But,” says the teacher, “you see he really did it to show the lady how"
foolish she was.” The answer of the boy sums up what I have been trying
"to show: “There was no sense in _his_ being sillier than _she_ was, to"
show her _she_ was silly.”
"If the boy had stopped there, we might have concluded that he was"
"lacking in imagination or romance, but his next remark proves what a"
"balanced and discriminating person he was, for he added: “Now, if _she_"
"had fallen in, and he had leapt after her to rescue her, that would"
"""He is come to do evil to--to Rollo!"" she said to herself, with a slight"
hesitation even in thought when she came for the first time upon the
Christian name.
But there was no hesitation in the swift assurance with which she set
"the rifle-stock to her shoulder, and no mistake as the keen and"
practised eye glanced along the barrel.
"She fired, and with a groan of pain the man fell back outside the"
enclosure.
The sound of Concha's shot was the first tidings to the besieged that
"the gipsies had really arrived. Rollo, stealing lightfoot from post to"
"post, pistol in hand, the Sergeant erect behind the vine-trellis on the"
"balcony between the rearward doors, Etienne and John Mortimer a little"
"farther along on the same side of the château, all redoubled their"
vigilance at the sound. But for the space of an hour or more nothing
"farther was seen or heard north, south, east, or west of the beleaguered"
palace of La Granja.
The gipsies had not had the least idea that their intention was known.
They expected no obstacles till the discharge of Concha's piece put them
"on their guard, and set them to concerting other and more subtle modes"
of attack. It was too dark for those in the château to see whether the
wounded man lay where he had fallen or whether he had been removed by
his comrades.
Rollo hastened back to Concha and inquired in a low voice what it was
she had fired at. Whereupon she told him the story of the man climbing
the railings and how she had stayed his course so suddenly. Rollo made
"no remark, save that she had done entirely right. Then he inquired if"
“I went to work in a millinery shop.” She shrugged her slender
"shoulders. “They starved me too,” she said--“just like the widow"
Snacheur. So----”
"She slipped her hand through his arm, laid her head against his"
"shoulder, and smiled:"
“But do not let us think of these things--it is so warm here.”
"The touch of the affectionate hands, the childlike caress of the girl,"
"the confidence and the clinging of her warm body to him, thrilled him."
She was in all the fresh beauty of her young womanhood; and the simple
"black gown, threadbare and worn as it was, only enhanced the beauty of"
her skin and pronounced the delicacy of her colour and the richness of
her splendid hair.
The girl increased the restlessness that had possessed the youth all
day. She brought to him the sweet whiteness and the subtle grace of
Betty--filled his senses with the atmosphere of the handsome girl who
had filled all his dreams from boyhood. It brought to him the most
"importunate craving of man, the love of woman."
Noll sat brooding for awhile. Yet even in the vigorous lust of life
"that held his young years, even as he sat there in the thrill of his"
"sweetest memories, he vaguely felt the gentle presence of these simple"
faded artistic folk about him; and he realized how indelibly the word
"Failure was written across them all. The coats were, if anything, more"
faded; the shoes more worn; the eyes alone lit up with the wonted glow
of delight in art. A little praise was their rich barmecidal feast.
"The greybeards, and the youths, and those between, they were all still"
"hoping to create the masterpiece--there was not, amongst them all,"
Presently the monkey had another disappointment. The intact tin
"baffled him. He tried his teeth upon it--but unavailingly, so he"
began to batter it upon the metal eye of a band encircling the spar.
"""There'll be an unholy mess, by Jove!"" ejaculated the commander, who"
"had now reappeared upon the scene, for the tin showed signs of"
capitulating to the strenuous frontal attacks on the part of
Mephisto.
"""Bring up another tin--and take care to open it this time,"" ordered"
"the staff-paymaster recklessly, who had now taken the precaution of"
covering the pay-tables with a green baize cloth.
"""Bang, bang, bang!"" went the tin under the muscular efforts of"
Mephisto. Already large drops of the viscous fluid were descending
"upon the hallowed quarter-deck, bespattering officers and men"
"indiscriminately, for owing to the ship's speed a strong current of"
air was drifting aft and spraying the stuff far and wide.
"""Clear the quarter-deck,"" ordered the commander. ""Up aloft a couple"
of hands and collar the brute. By Jove! if it gives much more
"trouble, I'll have it shot."""
"Suddenly, above the scuffling of feet as the men doubled for'ard,"
"came the shout: ""Submarine on the port quarter."""
"Sharply the bugle sounded ""Action,"" and as the ""Sunderland"" began to"
"circle to starboard in answer to a quick movement of her helm, the"
quick-firers began to bark at a pole-like object four hundred yards
off.
"The unexpected detonation, as a gun was discharged fifty feet under"
"there was one new thing, essentially Stella, which he had not noticed"
before. Surely it had been put there since his last visit.
In her own bedroom had hung since her imprisonment a fine reproduction
"of Watt's “Hope,” and, child though she was, she had divined, in a"
"child's unformulative way, the simple yet poignant symbolism of the"
"blindfold figure seated on this orb of land and sea, with meek head"
"bowed over a broken lyre, and with ear strained to the vibration of"
"the one remaining string. She loved the picture, and with unconscious"
"intuition and without consultation with Wratislaw, who would have"
"been horrified at its domination of his Adam room, had ordained that a"
similar copy should be hung on the wall facing the pillow of her Great
High Belovedest's bed.
The application of the allegory to his present state of being was
startlingly obvious. Risca knitted a puzzled brow. The new thing was
"essentially Stella, yet why had she caused it to be put in his room this"
day of all disastrous days? Was it not rather his cousin Julia's doing?
But such delicate conveyance of sympathy was scarcely Julia's way.
A sudden dread stabbed him. Had Stella herself heard rumours of the
"tragedy? He summoned Herold, who had a prescriptive right to the"
adjoining room.
"“If any senseless fools have told her, I 'll murder them,” he cried."
“The creatures of the sunset told her--at least as much as it was good
"for her to know,” said Herold."
“Do you mean that she did it in pure ignorance?”
"“In the vulgar acceptance of the word, yes,” smiled Herold. “Do you"
think that the human brain is always aware of the working of the divine
Both Zeppelins began to throw out ballast with frantic haste. They
"also released the whole of their remaining supply of bombs, which"
fell with a rapid series of deafening detonations more than half a
mile from the nearest destroyer.
With the release of the ballast the undamaged Zeppelin shot skywards
until her altitude was not less than ten thousand feet. Comparatively
"safe for the time being from the effect of the anti-aircraft shells,"
"she floated, a mere speck in the concentrated yet diminished glare of"
"a dozen searchlights, and awaited events."
"Meanwhile, the damaged Zeppelin had checked her plunge, and, in spite"
"of a hot fire, was slowly rising. By dint of strenuous efforts her"
crew succeeded in shifting aft the travelling weight that served to
trim the unwieldy craft. Even then her longitudinal axis was sharply
inclined to the horizontal.
"Everything that could be jettisoned was thrown overboard. Guns,"
"ammunition, stores, and the metal framework of the wrecked car were"
"sacrificed, till without being hit by the British guns, she rose to a"
terrific height.
"""We've lost her!"" exclaimed Oswestry savagely."
"""One thing, she won't trouble us again,"" added the commander. ""And"
I'm not so certain that she will get clear. We've wirelessed the
"seaplanes, and they'll have a chip in. Hullo! What's the game now?"""
A searchlight flashed from the undamaged Zeppelin and played in
ever-widening circles until it picked up her damaged consort. The
latter was consequently more plainly discernible to the crew of the
"There were a lot of untouched spaces--a horde, a myriad. On the side"
"wall was a chart, showing that nine squadrons of twenty-five spacecraft"
"each were patrolling back and forth through the uncharted wastes,"
seeking the space-wrecked lifeships.
The maddening part was the hourly report from both lifeships. It was
"like someone hiding in the dark and calling for aid, invisible and"
"alone. And not really calling for aid, but only making whimpering"
noises. For the signaling equipment on the lifeships was not equipped
"with the complicated infrawave phone, but only with the simple"
"signal-emitter, coded to transmit the identification call of the unit."
"On the hour they came in, calling three times, ""Lifeship Seventy-nine,"
"Seventy-nine, Number Three."" Number Two had not been heard from."
"Presumably it was not in use, or hadn't made the grade."
Wilson chewed his fingernails and fretted. Was Alice on Number One or
"Number Three, or was she on Number Two and it had foundered?"
"If she were still alive, what kind of fellow survivors were with her?"
He hoped she was with a group. If she had blown out in a lifeship with
"only one other--well, Ted Wilson did not like the idea. Of course, it"
was more customary than not for a young woman to love lightly before
she mated permanently. There was a lot less chance of wading into
matrimony wide-eyed and ignorant of what it was all about.
"But Wilson, if willing to face such transient loving at all, would"
"have preferred that Alice have her chance to pick and choose, rather"
than have the matter thrust upon her in the middle of a threatening
situation. The passion that comes with the shadow of death is only the
"instinct of racial preservation, and it mates men and women unsuited to"
"end reached, he let the paper fall on his knees, lay back, and took a"
"long pull at his cigar. He was shocked--yes, he supposed he was"
"shocked. He had known the man, and it was shocking to think of his"
"throat being cut; yes, he had known him, and he didn't like to think of"
that. But--The Premier gave a long-drawn sigh of relief. That unknown
murderer's hand had done great things for him. His daughter was safe
"now--anyhow, she was safe. She could never be subject to the degradation"
the dead man had once hinted at; and when he thought of what the man had
"threatened, pity for him died out of Medland's heart. More--although"
Kilshaw no doubt knew something--there was a chance that Benham had kept
"his own counsel, and that his employer would be helpless without his"
"aid. Medland's sanguine mind caught eagerly at the chance, and in a"
moment turned it into a hope--almost a conviction. Then the whole thing
"would go down to the grave with the unlucky man, and not even its"
"spectre survive to trouble him. For if no one had certain knowledge, if"
"there were never more than gossip, growing, as time passed, fainter and"
"fainter from having no food to feed on, would not utter silence follow"
"at last, so that the things that had been might be as if they had never"
been?
"""Well, what do they say about us?"" asked the Treasurer."
"""Oh, nothing much,"" he answered, thrusting the paper behind him with a"
careless air. He did not want to discuss what the paper had told him.
"""What's happened to-day,"" said Daisy, ""ought to make all the difference,"
"oughtn't it, father?"""
"""I hope it will,"" replied the Premier; but, for once in his life, he was"
not thinking most about political affairs.
Belgium for Holland. But this last plea was said by the American
"representative to be unsustainable. For various reasons, the German"
"Government would not permit it, and he was afraid neither Vivie nor"
her mother would get enough backing from the British authorities to
strengthen the American demand. She must stop on in Brussels till
the War came to an end.
"""But how are we to live?"" asked Vivie, with a catch in her throat."
"""Our supply of Belgian money is coming to an end. My mother has"
considerable funds invested in England. These she can't touch. She
"has other sums in German securities, but soon after the War they"
stopped sending her the interest on the plea that she was an
"'enemy.' As to the money we have in Belgium, the bank in Brussels"
"can tell me nothing. What are we to do?"" The rather cold-mannered"
American diplomatist--it was one of the Secretaries of Legation and
"he knew all about Mrs. Warren's past, and regarded Vivie as an"
outlaw--said he would try to communicate with her friends in England
"and see if through the American Relief organization, funds could be"
transmitted for their maintenance. She gave him the addresses of
"Rossiter, Praed, and her mother's London bankers."
Vivie now tried to settle down to a life of usefulness. To increase
their resources she gave lessons in English to Belgians and even to
German officers. She offered herself to various groups of Belgian
ladies who had taken up such charities as the Germans permitted. She
also asked to be taken on as a Red Cross helper. But in all these
directions she had many snubs to meet and little encouragement.
Scandal had been busy with her name--the unhappy reputation of her
"mother, the peculiar circumstances under which she had left England,"
the two or three months shut up at Tervueren with Colonel von
"Giesselin, and the very protection he now accorded her and her"
mother at the Hotel Impérial. She felt herself looked upon almost as
burst into a roar of laughter. For the moment the _gamin_ in him was
uppermost--the same curly-pated rascal who had climbed walls and stolen
apples from the market-women's stalls of Tortosa thirty years ago.
"""You are a brave fellow,"" cried the general, ""and I would to Heaven that"
your royal cousin had more of your spirit. Are all of your company of
"the same warlike kidney?"""
"""I trust I am afraid of no man on the field of honour,"" answered the"
"loyal little Frenchman, throwing out his chest. ""Yet I speak but the"
truth when I aver that there is not one of my companions who could not
"say grace and eat me up afterwards!"""
Among the letters which had formed part of Rollo's credentials there was
"one superscribed ""_To be opened in the camp of General Cabrera_."""
"Cabrera now dismissed the firing party with a wave of his hand, the"
officer in command exchanging an encouraging nod with Rollo. Then he
summoned that young man to approach. Rollo threw away the last inch of
"his cigarette, and going up easily, saluted the general with his usual"
self-possession.
"""Well, colonel,"" said the latter, ""I little thought to exchange"
civilities with you again; but for that you have to thank this young
lady. The fortune of war once more! But if young men will entrust
"precious papers to pretty girls, they must have a fund of gratitude upon"
"which to draw--that is, when the ladies arrive in time. On this occasion"
it was most exactly done. Yet you must have lived through some very
"crowded moments while you faced the muzzles of yonder rifles!"""
And he pointed to the lane down which the firing party was defiling.
his shoulder.
"Boswell and Trent, each with a little missive burning his pocket, turned"
"red, fidgeted, glared at the ocean, and made no remark. Severance darted"
"a glance at each of the three in succession, and then looked at the"
ground with a contemplative stare. At this moment Mrs. Pendleton
appeared.
Three of the men advanced to meet her with an awkward attempt at
"surprise, but she waved them back."
"“I have something to say to you,” she said."
The cold languor of her face had given place to an expression of haughty
triumph. A gleam of conscious power lay deep in her scornful eyes. The
"final act in the drama had come, and the dénouement should be worthy of"
her talents. She looked like a judge who had smiled encouragement to a
guilty defendant only to confer the sentence of capital punishment at
last.
"“Gentlemen,” she said, and even her voice was judicatorial, “I have"
"asked you all to meet me here this morning”—(three angry starts, but"
she went on unmoved)—“because I came to the conclusion last night that
"it is quite time this farce should end. I am somewhat bored myself, and"
"I have no doubt you are so, as well. Your joke was a clever one, worthy"
of the idle days of autumn. When I received your four proposals by the
"same mail, I appreciated your wit—I will say more, your genius—and"
"felt glad to do anything I could to contribute to your amusement,"
especially as all the world is away and I knew how dull you must be. So
"I accepted each of you, as you know, had four charming interviews and"
one memorable one of a more composite nature; and now that we have all
agreed that the spicy and original little drama has run its length I
Across the void from her world to my own she was signaling--trying to
tell me what?--and frantically my fancy sprang to translate the message.
"But as the man, with growing agitation, had been watching narrowly"
throughout this--a condition of which I felt sure she must be acutely
aware--I dared not make the slightest sign. Yet she seemed to understand
"and, joining him, they passed out."
I pounced upon that crumpled ball of paper and was back in my chair
unfolding it with nervous fingers. Feverishly pressing out the creases I
"saw that it was, indeed, a corner torn from the winecard, and written"
upon it--nothing. Absolutely nothing!
"Perhaps I should have laughed, but as a matter of fact I cursed. Deep in"
"my soul I cursed. Her little joke, her pretty bit of acting, had left a"
stinging sense of loss. As suddenly as this ruthless comet swept into my
orbit it had swung out and on; for one delicious moment we had touched
"across the infinite, but now my harmony was shattered, the strings of my"
"harp were snapped, curled up, and could not be made to play again."
"But the Spanish girl was playing her guitar, once more singing her"
"impassioned song of the enchanted island in its sea of love, which made"
me pity myself so much that I permitted the waiter again to fill my
glass. What a wondrous adventure this night might have brought!
Such thoughts wore not to be profaned by the companionship of Tommy and
"Monsieur, so I slipped away, hailed a cab and alighted at the Machina"
"wharf. The boatman there, whom I aroused to take me out, was one of the"
"most stupid fellows I've ever encountered. At any rate, someone was"
stupid.
Going aboard the yacht I stood for a moment listening to the lonely
"loves. Death, he says, and life are one; not antagonistic, but the same;"
and the only way to escape from one is to escape from the other too.
"Only in the Great Peace, when we have found refuge from the passion and"
"tumult of life, shall we find the place where death cannot come. Life"
and death are one.
"This is the teaching of the Buddha, repeated over and over again to his"
"disciples when they sorrowed for the death of Thariputra, when they"
were in despair at the swift-approaching end of the great teacher
"himself. Hear what he says to Ananda, the beloved disciple, who is"
mourning over Thariputra.
"'Ananda,' he said, 'often and often have I sought to bring shelter to"
your soul from the misery caused by such grief as this. There are two
"things alone that can separate us from father and mother, from brother"
"and sister, from all those who are most cherished by us, and those two"
"things are distance and death. Think not that I, though the Buddha, have"
not felt all this even as any other of you; was I not alone when I was
seeking for wisdom in the wilderness?
'And yet what would I have gained by wailing and lamenting either for
myself or for others? Would it have brought to me any solace from my
loneliness? Would it have been any help to those whom I had left? There
"is nothing that can happen to us, however terrible, however miserable,"
that can justify tears and lamentations and make them aught but a
weakness.'
"And so, we are told, in this way the Buddha soothed the affliction of"
"Ananda, and filled his soul with consolation--the consolation of"
resignation.
"For there is no other consolation possible but this, resignation to the"
ranks of library editions that no one reads. These stiff and formal
"backs, these ornamental edges, these dandified and dyed airs, repel me"
from my ancient friendships. The intimacy of years is broken--frozen.
"They open no longer eagerly at the old accustomed places, stained"
"with frequent thumbings, where my own hand cut the dear intimate"
leaves--they are deckle-edged and bedamned and horrible which were wont
to be delightfully impertinent. I cannot find my way in the old garden
"that I loved--the old dog-ears are smoothed out, gone--my pencillings"
"erased, their whisperings mute, they nudge my elbow no more. These, my"
one-time boon companions snub me; give me but the flabby handshake of
"necessity. They open their houses to me mincingly, and yawn affected"
"utterance. They no longer tickle me in the ribs, touching me on the"
"sleeve, nor beckon; they do not chuckle familiarly--nor brood with"
me upon the roll and march of the great significancies. Their new
clothes are insistent--upon them as upon me. They smell of the oil of
respectability like gagged Sunday-school children. We know each other
no longer--except with formal bow and elaborate etiquette--as when a
royal person enters the room of entertainment and puts good-fellowship
to the rout.”
"He made a pause, and, passing his gaunt hand over his brow, he added"
sadly:
“I have come home to find myself in a strange land.... Shining-faced
respectability has usurped my chair.... My kingdom has slipped from
me.... The flowers in my garden are dead.”
Noll patted him on the back:
"“Tut, tut, man--you have come into a new kingdom.”"
He heard Julia’s voice upon the stair; and he saw that the other had
"goats, hastily deposited the babe within, and upon the white linen the"
"red earth fell first like thin rain, and afterwards, when the sheet was"
"covered, in lumps and mattock-clods. For La Giralda desired to be gone,"
suddenly becoming mindful of the precepts of the Sergeant.
"""No priest has blessed the grave,"" she said; ""I can say no prayers over"
her! Who is La Giralda that she should mutter the simplest prayer? But
"when the Master of Life awakes the little one, and when He sees the look"
"she will cast on her poor puppet of wood, He will take her to His bosom"
"even as La Giralda, the mother of many, would have taken her! God, the"
"Good One, cannot be more cruel than a woman of the heathen!"""
"And so with the broken pottery for a monument, and the clasp of infant"
"hands about the wooden doll for a prayer to God, the dead babe was left"
"alone, unblessed and unconfessed--but safe."
*       *       *       *       *
Meanwhile we must go over the hill with Sergeant Cardono. Whatever his
"thoughts may have been as he trudged up the barren glens, seamed and"
"torn with the winter rains, no sign of them appeared upon his sunburnt"
"weather-beaten face. Steadily and swiftly, yet without haste, he held"
"his way, his eyes fixed on the ground, as though perfectly sure of his"
"road, like a man on a well-beaten track which he has trod a thousand"
times.
"For more than an hour he went on, up and ever up, till his feet crisped"
"upon the first snows of Peñalara, and the hill ramparts closed in. But"
"when he had reached the narrows of a certain gorge, he looked keenly to"
"either side, marking the entrance. A pile of stones roughly heaped one"
upon the other fixed his attention. He went up to them and attentively
"perused their structure and arrangement, though they appeared to have"
The wind blustered outside. The cold draught whistled through the room.
"Joyce rose to his feet with a shiver, went to a corner for a couple of"
"sacks, which he threw over the sleeping man, and, after having wistfully"
"read Yvonne’s letter once more, ascended the ladder to the loft, where"
the shapeless mattress of dried grass and sacking awaited him.
CHAPTER XII--HISTOIRE DE REVENANT
Ostend is a magnificent white Kursaal on the Belgian coast. Certain
requisites are attached to it in the way of great hotels and villas
"along a tiled _digue_, and innumerable bathing-machines on the sands"
"below. There is an old town, it is true, somewhere behind it, with"
"quaint narrow streets, a Place d’Armes dotted round with cafés, and"
a thronged market-square; there is also a bustling port and a fishing
population. But the Ostend of practical life begins and ends at the
"Kursaal. Were it to perish during a night, the following day would see"
the exodus of twenty thousand visitors. The vast glass rotunda can hold
thousands. Within its precincts you can do anything in reason and out of
"reason. You can knit all day long like Penelope, or you can go among"
the Sirens with or without the precautions of Ulysses. You can consume
anything from a biscuit to a ten-course dinner. You can play dominoes at
centime points or roulette with a forty-franc minimum. You can listen to
"music, you can dance, you can go to sleep. You can write letters, send"
"telegrams, and open a savings-bank account. By moving to one side or the"
other of a glass screen you can sit in the warm sunshine or in the keen
sea wind. You can study the fashions of Europe from St. Petersburg to
"Dublin, and if you are a woman, you can wear the most sumptuous garments"
"Providence has deigned to bestow on you. And lastly, if you are looking"
that this was the man he hated. He simply felt an overwhelming
"thankfulness that some one had come at last, and obeyed orders"
mechanically and without question.
"But as his peavey gripped the end of that troublesome log, there"
suddenly flamed into Curly’s mind--temptation. Bainbridge stood below
"him, perched perilously on the very face of the jam. A little"
thrust--the tiniest movement of the riverman’s arm--would send him
"plunging into the stream, while another movement would suffice to drop"
one of the looser logs upon him. There were no witnesses; the whole
"affair would pass as an unfortunate accident. A chance like this, so"
"easy, so absolutely safe, would never come again."
"“Now!” broke in the crisp voice of the lumberman. “Hard over, boy."
Toward me--all you know how!”
Curly’s muscles strained as he threw every ounce of strength into the
pull. The key log creaked and groaned as if agony but was thrust
"gradually forward. Curly felt it moving faster and faster, and"
instinctively he prepared for that backward leap which would carry him
out of reach of the treacherous avalanche of falling logs.
A second later his peavey was torn from his hands by the sudden collapse
of half the face of the jam. The logs at his side vanished in the
"unexpected rush, but that on which he stood remained firm for a precious"
moment. Below him he saw Bainbridge whirl like a cat and grasp for
"something solid. Instantly he bent over, reaching out both callous,"
"muscular hands, and as swiftly Bob gripped them. There was a heave, an"
"upward scramble, another crash as the remainder of the jam disappeared"
"into the foaming water. But the two men had leaped in time, and a moment"
later they were standing together on the bank.
"the probability of an adventure with tolerant amusement, such was his"
inherent love of it and so developed was his capacity for
"""playing-true,"" that he sometimes made me think almost anything might"
"turn up. I was quite unaware that my mother had written him, or that he,"
"in return, had promised to keep her fully advised of my improvement--a"
state which was already beginning.
"""I carn't see how you help talking of it, sir--all that gas, and liquid"
"fire, and bursting shells,"" Gates stared at him in perplexity."
"""It's an effort, but I refuse to turn phonograph like some of the old"
"timers--not that I love 'em any less for it, Lord knows!"" Then he began"
"to laugh, and turned to me, adding: ""One of the first things I did after"
getting home was to drop in on a very dear gentleman who's been a friend
"of our family since the Ark. He came at me with open arms, crying:"
"'Well, Thomas, sit right down and tell me about your experiences!' I"
side-tracked that--for I hate the word. We didn't go over for
"_experiences_! But he wouldn't be denied. 'Try to think,' he commanded."
"'Why, Thomas, old as I am, I remember when Stonewall Jackson struck that"
"brilliant blow----' and you can shoot me for a spy, Jack, if he didn't"
keep me there five hours while he fought the entire Civil War! No
"sir-ee! After tonight, never again!"""
"But Tommy's talk, to which the crew listened in rapt attention, consumed"
"nearer six than two, or even five hours. These men were hungry for"
authentic first-hand information--being too old to have sought it for
themselves.
It must not be inferred that the _Whim's_ crew consisted of the ancient
and decrepit. More than once my father had said that if ever he should
get in a tight place there was no band of six he would rather have at
"his back than this one headed by Gates; nor did he except Pete, the"
his feet during the past two days; I don't know what he has
discovered; but if he does not get to the bottom of the business in
"double-quick time we shall have the whole Board of Admiralty, Scotland"
"Yard, and possibly the War Cabinet down upon us. Think, too, of the"
"disgrace to this shipbuilding city of which we are all so proud."""
"""We shall know something soon,"" I said, ""for, if I mistake not, here"
"comes Dawson."" The electric bell at the front door had buzzed, and"
"Cary, slipping from the room, presently returned with a man who to me,"
"at the first glance, was a complete stranger. I sprang up, moved round"
"to a position whence I could see clearly the visitor's ears, and"
"gasped. It was Dawson beyond a doubt, but it was not the Dawson whom I"
had known in the north. So what I had vaguely surmised was
true--Cary's Dawson and Copplestone's Dawson were utterly unlike.
"Dawson winked at me, glanced towards Cary, and shook his head; from"
which I gathered that he did not desire his appearance to be the
"subject of comment. I therefore greeted him without remark, and, as he"
"sat down under the electric lights, examined him in detail. This"
Dawson was ten years older than the man whom I had known and fenced
"with. The hair of this one was lank and grey, while that of mine was"
"brown and curly; the face of this one was white and thin, while the"
face of mine was rather full and ruddy. The teeth were different--I
"found out afterwards that Dawson, who had few teeth of his own,"
possessed several artificial sets of varied patterns--the shape of the
"mouth was different, the nose was different. I could never have"
recognised the man before me had I not possessed that clue to identity
furnished by his unchanging ears.
"""So, Dawson,"" said I slowly, ""we meet again. Permit me to say that I"
"congratulate you. It is very well done."""
"He grinned and glanced at the unconscious Cary. ""You are learning."
"have gained admission by some secret passage!"""
With Rollo Blair to think was to act. So in another moment he had
"slipped off his shoes, and treading noiselessly on his stocking soles"
and with a naked sword in his hand he made his way swiftly and carefully
down towards the place whence he had heard the noise.
Descending by the grand _escalier_ he found himself in one of the narrow
corridors which communicated by private staircases with the left wing of
the palace. Rollo stood still in the deepest shadow. He was sure that he
"could hear persons moving near him, and once he thought that he could"
distinguish the sound of a muttered word.
The Egyptian darkness about him grew more and more instinct with noises.
"There was a scuffling rustle, as of birds in a chimney, all over the"
basement of the house. A door creaked as if a slight wind had blown it.
"Then a latch clicked, and the wind, unaided, does not click latches."
Rollo withdrew himself deeper into a niche at the foot of the narrow
winding-stair which girdled a tower in the thickness of the wall.
"The young man had almost resolved to summon his whole force from above,"
so convinced was he that the enemy had gained a footing within the tower
"and were creeping up to take them in the rear, when a sound altered his"
intention. There is nothing more unmistakable to the ear than the
rebellious whimper of an angry child compelled to do something against
its will.
Rollo instantly comprehended the whole chain of circumstances. The
treachery touched him more nearly than he had imagined possible. Those
for whom he and his party were imperilling their lives were in fact to
leave them to perish as best they might in the empty shell of the
palace. The royal birds were on the point of flying.
"Now, Maung Kan's wife had born to him twin sons. They were born at"
"Okshitgon shortly before their parents had to run away, and they were"
"named, the eldest Maung Gyi, which is Brother Big-fellow, and the"
"younger Maung Ngè, which means Brother Little-fellow. These lads grew up"
"at Kabyu, and soon learned to talk; and as they grew up their parents"
"were surprised to hear them calling to each other at play, and calling"
"each other, not Maung Gyi and Maung Ngè, but Maung San Nyein and Ma"
"Gywin. The latter is a woman's name, and the parents remembered that"
these were the names of the man and wife who had died in Okshitgon about
the time the children were born.
So the parents thought that the souls of the man and wife had entered
"into the children, and they took them to Okshitgon to try them. The"
children knew everything in Okshitgon; they knew the roads and the
"houses and the people, and they recognised the clothes they used to wear"
"in a former life; there was no doubt about it. One of them, the younger,"
"remembered, too, how she had borrowed two rupees once of a woman, Ma"
"Thet, unknown to her husband, and left the debt unpaid. Ma Thet was"
"still living, and so they asked her, and she recollected that it was"
true she had lent the money long ago.
Shortly afterwards I saw these two children. They are now just over six
"years old. The elder, into whom the soul of the man entered, is a fat,"
"chubby little fellow, but the younger twin is smaller, and has a curious"
"dreamy look in his face, more like a girl than a boy. They told me much"
about their former lives. After they died they said they lived for some
"time without a body at all, wandering in the air and hiding in the"
"trees. This was for their sins. Then, after some months, they were born"
"again as twin boys. 'It used,' said the elder boy, 'to be so clear, I"
"could remember everything; but it is getting duller and duller, and I"
cannot now remember as I used to do.'
the woman's son's soul is not in the animal. The woman is not entitled
to the deer because she cannot prove that it is. The deer will therefore
remain with the court until some properly authenticated claim is put
in.'
"So the two parties were turned out, the woman in bitter tears, and the"
"hunters angry and vexed, and the deer remained the property of the"
judge.
But this decision was against all Burmese ideas of justice. He should
"have given the deer to the woman. 'He wanted it for himself,' said a"
"Burman, speaking to me of the affair. 'He probably killed it and ate it."
Surely it is true that officials are of all the five evils the
"greatest.' Then my friend remembered that I was myself an official, and"
"he looked foolish, and began to make complimentary remarks about English"
"officials, that they would never give such an iniquitous decision. I"
turned it off by saying that no doubt the judge was now suffering in
"some other life for the evil wrought in the last, and the Burman said"
that probably he was now inhabiting a tiger.
"It is very easy to laugh at such beliefs; nothing is, indeed, easier"
than to be witty at the expense of any belief. It is also very easy to
"say that it is all self-deception, that the children merely imagine that"
"they remember their former lives, or are citing conversation of their"
elders.
"How this may be I do not know. What is the explanation of this, perhaps"
the only belief of which we have any knowledge which is at once a living
"belief to-day and was so as far back as we can get, I do not pretend to"
"say. For transmigration is no theory of Buddhism at all, but was a"
"leading tenet in the far older faith of Brahmanism, of which Buddhism"
"was but an offshoot, as was Christianity of Judaism."
"and kicked the world about like a football, and striven to dig up the"
roots of the Universe--the Why and the Wherefore and the Whence and the
Whither.”
Netherby sighed:
"“Ah, Noll, the old room is gone. I have to begin all over again. These"
stiff prude seats compel me to order--tell me harshly that I must not
"be dreaming overmuch, nor thinking--which is next door to dreaming--but"
"nag me to be up and doing, boiling pots or eggs or hitting something"
or pushing at things. I don’t seem to fit in anywhere. The medieval
rigours warn me to be done with visions and the reading of the visions
of others; and their hard oaken seats rise up and assault me where I
would sit upon them.... But that is nothing. They have left me not even
my books. I am bewildered--bewildered--wholly bewildered.”
"He sighed sadly, and went on:"
"“Ah, Noll, he only knows the whole delight of having possessed a"
child who has lost it.... Books are one’s most intimate friends--they
never change--never play us a shabby trick. How they eat into one’s
"friendship, each dressed in his individual habit! the very ugliness"
of some a reason for seeking to win their confidence; perhaps a
reason for an easy familiarity--we dog-ear them the more--mark them
"the more--love them the more. Put them in handsome ranks uniform, and"
their individuality is gone--like sisters that are primly arrayed to
the same pattern to simper through a tedious garden-party. We begin to
find faults where was once only affection; and their outward seeming
"being now alike, like critics we seek to taste not the delights"
"within, but carp because this has not Shakespeare’s wit nor that the"
"thunders and the music of Carlyle. These that were once our closest,"
"most garrulous, most intimate friends have gone to join the silent"
"She had a little money from her late husband (the real one), and had"
been lavishly paid for her services during the war. War prices in London
seemed quite moderate to her after the extortions of France and Italy.
She re-occupied her old rooms near Shaftesbury Avenue--and incidentally
made homeless a pair of exiled Belgians--and fed after the fashion that
she loved in the restaurants of Soho. Madame enjoyed her food. She
"always scoffed at Beauty Specialists. ""Look at me,"" she would say. ""Look"
"closely at my skin, at my hair, at my teeth if you like. What you see is"
God's gift improved by exact care for my health. I do physical exercises
for twenty minutes every night and morning. I plunge all over into cold
"water whenever I can get together enough to cover me, and I eat and"
drink whatever I like. I shall go on living for just as long as I am
beautiful and healthy. When I have to think of my digestion or of the
"colour of my skin, I shall say Good-bye and go West in a dream of"
"morphia."" Superficially, Madame is a Roman Catholic; at heart she is a"
Greek Pagan.
It was at La Grande Patisserie Belge that Madame stumbled across the
lawyer who was fated to introduce her to the Cannibal of whom she told
me in Whitehall.
"It was a melancholy afternoon in January, peace had not brought"
plenty--especially of coal--and Madame was fortifying herself against
the damp chills of London by long draughts of the hottest coffee and the
sweetest and stickiest confectionery which even she could relish. About
"six feet distant, on what one may describe as her port quarter, sat a"
middle-aged Englishman whose bagging clothes showed that war rations
"had dealt sorely with his once ample person. Madame, who without turning"
"her head examined him in critical detail, judged that his loss in weight"
"was three stone. He had the clean, shaven face and alert aspect of a"
lawyer or doctor. In fancied security a little to the left and rear of
"The third forward bay, located beneath the other two and down a set of"
"steel stairs, was the one he needed to penetrate. It contained all the"
"computer gear: flight control, navigation, and most importantly, the"
artificial intelligence (AI) system for pilot interface and backup.
He suddenly found himself thinking a strange thought. Since no air-
"breathing vehicle had ever flown hypersonic, every component in this"
"plane was, in a sense, untested. To his mind, though, that was merely"
one more argument for shutting down the damned AI system's override
"functions before he went hypersonic. If something did go wrong, he"
wanted this baby on manual. He only needed the computer to alert him to
potential problems. The solutions he'd have to work out with his own
"brain. And balls. After all, that's why he was there."
"As he walked down the steel steps, he thumbed through the magnetic"
"cards, praying he had the one needed to open the lower bay and access"
the computers. Then he began inserting them one by one into the green
"metallic slot, trying to keep his hand steady in the freezing cold."
"Finally one worked. The three encoded diodes blinked, and a hydraulic"
"arm automatically slid the port open. Next the interior lights came on,"
an orange high-voltage sodium glow illuminating the gray walls.
"This third bay, like the two above it, was big enough to stand in. As"
"he stepped in, he glanced back up the stairs, then quickly resealed the"
"door. Off went the lights again, so he withdrew his penlight and turned"
to start searching for what he wanted.
Directly in front of him was a steel monolith with banks of toggle
"switches: electrical power controls, communications controls,"
"propulsion system controls, reaction-control systems. Okay, that's the"
"she had recharged her piece, and hearing that she wanted nothing and was"
"ready for all emergencies, he departed upon his rounds without the least"
leave-taking or approach to love-making. In her heart Concha respected
"him for this, but at the same time she could not help feeling that a"
Spaniard would have been somewhat warmer in his acknowledgments.
Nevertheless she comforted herself with the thought that he had trusted
"her with one of the most important posts in the whole defence, and she"
prayed fervently to the Virgin that she might be able to do her duty
there.
"She thought also that, when the morning came, perhaps he would have more"
"time. For her, she could wait--here she smiled a little. Yes, she"
"acknowledged it. She who had caught so many, was now taken in her own"
net. She would go to the world's end for this young Scot. Nor in her
heart of hearts was she ashamed of it. Above and beyond all courtesies
"and sugared phrases she loved his free-handed, careless, curt-spoken,"
"hectoring way. After his one kiss, he had treated her exactly like any"
"other of his company. He did not make love well, but--she liked him none"
the worse for that. In such matters (sayeth the Wise Man) excellence is
apt to come with experience.
"And he would learn. Yes, decidedly he might yet do credit to his"
"teacher. To-morrow morning would arrive, and for the present, well--she"
would keep her finger upon the trigger and a pair of remarkably
clear-sighted eyes upon the grey space of greensward crossed by black
trellises of railing immediately before her. That in the mean time was
"her duty to her love and (she acknowledged it), her master."
"Apart from these details of his feeling for Concha, however (which gave"
"him little concern), Rollo was far from satisfied with the condition of"
affairs. He would rather (so he confided to the Sergeant) have defended
"a sheepfold or a simple cottage than this many-chambered, many-passaged,"
shameful secret.
A sound--the sound of a man in great pain checked her hysterical sobs.
"Dazed, she passed her hand over her face as if to clear away the dark"
shades that were obstructing her vision. Another groan--and like a flash
she was down on her knees lavishing endearments upon the road agent.
"Never before, it is true, had the Girl had any experience in gun-shot"
"wounds. She had played the part of nurse, however, more than once when"
the boys met with accidents at the mines. For the women of the
California camps at that time had endless calls upon them. It was a
"period for sacrifices innumerable, and help and sympathy were never"
"asked that they were not freely given. So, if the Girl did not know the"
"very best thing to do, she knew, at least, what not to do, and it was"
only a few minutes before she had cut the coat from his back.
The next thing to be done--the dragging of the unconscious man to the
"bed--was hard work, of course, but being strong of arm, as well as stout"
"of heart, she at last accomplished it."
"Now she cut away his shirt in order to find the wound, which proved to"
be in his breast. Quickly then she felt with her fingers in an endeavour
"to find the ball, but in this she was unsuccessful. So after a moment's"
deliberation she made up her mind that the wound was a flesh one and
that the ball was anywhere but in the man's body--a diagnosis that was
"largely due to the cheerful optimism of her nature and which,"
"fortunately, proved to be true."
Presently she went to a corner of the room and soon returned with a
basin of water and some hastily torn bandages. For a good fifteen
"minutes after that she washed the gash and, finally, bandaged it as well"
"as she knew how. And now, having done all that her knowledge or instinct"
know more of this man and his life held Grey’s soul in thrall.  He had
"always experienced a vivid curiosity to taste life in its various forms,"
"to know and understand the thoughts, the feelings, the aspirations, the"
ambitions of other men.  His travels had given him insight into many
matters; but he felt that these new experiences were likely to be more
"searching, more exciting, more full of keen personal interest.  He had"
"been, as it were, a spectator heretofore; now he was to be a"
participator.
He had not meant to be any man’s guest; he had meant to take a modest
"lodging of his own, and look about him for something in the way of"
"employment, but Lord Sandford had roared with laughter over such a"
notion.
"""What!  Sir Grey Dumaresq going cap in hand to some proud place-giver to"
"ask for patronage, or I know not what!  Gadzooks, man, with that face,"
"that figure, that horse, and a purse full of guineas, you can do better"
than that!  Trust yourself to me. I’ll show you where fame and fortune
lie.  You shall redeem your rat-infested old house in a very brief
"while, if you will but trust yourself to my guidance.  You be Damon to"
"my Pythias—or is it t’other way round, eh?—and I’ll show you the royal"
"road to the goal you want."""
"For lack of any definite plans, Grey had consented for the nonce to"
"accept Lord Sandford’s advice, and had quickly found himself installed"
"in some gloomy and stately yet luxurious chambers in a vast house, of"
"which only a portion was open for use, and the rest given over to a"
neglect and decay that Hartsbourne itself could scarcely rival.
"""But we shall change all that some day,"" spoke Lord Sandford, with a"
"careless laugh, as Grey expressed his surprise at the vast rooms and"
"long galleries shut up and infested by rats and spiders. ""Oh yes, we"
which the queen was giving that night. It was an unfortunate time for me
"to see Mary. My heart was full, not to overflowing, but to sinking, with"
my love of Bettina and her love of me. There was nothing I would not have
given at that time to be able to take her as my wife. I should have been
"glad to give my title, estates, and position--everything--to be a simple"
tradesman or an innkeeper so that I might take Bettina with happiness to
her and without the damning sin of losing caste to me.
It was true the king's brother had made a marriage of comparatively the
"same sort, but it is almost as impossible for a prince to lose caste as"
it is difficult for a mere baron to keep it. Bettina would not be happy
"in my sphere of life, nor could I live in hers, so what was there for me"
"to do but to keep my engagement with Mary Hamilton and, if I could, lose"
my love for Bettina.
*        *        *        *        *
"The queen's ball was to be held that night at St. James's Palace, and"
I was glad to have the walk from Whitehall across the park. The night was
"perfect. A slim moon hung in the west, considerately withholding a part"
of her light that the stars might twinkle the brighter in their vain
"effort to rival Bettina's eyes. The night wind came to me, odor-laden"
"from the roses, only to show me how poor a thing it was compared with"
Bettina's breath upon my cheek and its sweetness in my nostrils. Now and
"then a belated bird sang its sleepy song, only to remind me of the melody"
"of her lullabies, and the cooing dove moaned out its plaintive call lest"
I forget the pain in her breast while selfishly remembering the ache in
"my own. Then I thought of what the Good Book says about ""bright clouds,"""
and I prayed that my pain might make me a better man and might lead me to
"help Bettina in the days of her sorrowing, which I knew were at hand."
"Soon after I had kissed the hands of the king and the queen, I met"
branches.
"For the first time we saw one another's faces, and how pale and"
"woe-begone, mudstained and draggled we were! The cold, grey light,"
"which so mercilessly unmasked our refuge, did not spare us. It helped"
even my lady to look her worst. Fraulein Anna sat a mere lifeless lump
in her saddle. The waiting-women cried softly; they had cried all
"night. The Waldgrave looked dazed, as if he barely understood where he"
was or why he was there.
"To think over-much in such a place was to weep. Instead, I hastened to"
"get them all off their horses, and with Steve's help and a great"
"bundle of osiers and branches which we cut, I made nests for them in"
"the lower boughs of the willows, well out of reach of the water. When"
"they had all taken their places, I served out food and a dram of"
"Dantzic waters, which some of us needed; for a white mist, drawn up"
"from the swamp by the rising sun, began to enshroud us, and, hanging"
"among the osiers for more than an hour, prolonged the misery of the"
night.
"Still, even that rolled away at last--about six o'clock--and let us"
see the sun shining overhead in a heaven of blue distance and golden
"clouds. Larks rose up and sang, and all the birds of the marsh began"
to twitter and tweet. In a trice our mud island was changed to a
bower--a place of warmth and life and refreshment--where light and
"shade lay on the dappled floor, and the sunshine fell through green"
leaves.
"Then I took the cloaks, and the saddles, and everything that was wet,"
and spread them out on branches to dry; and leaving the women to make
themselves comfortable in their own way and shift themselves as they
"pleased, we two, with the Waldgrave and the two servants, went away to"
"""It _has_ been a pleasant evening,"" she said, inanely."
"""I saw you for the first time to-night, Cherry. I think I have begun to"
"know you."""
"Again she felt her heart leap. Reaching out to say good-bye, his hand"
"slipped down over her arm, like a caress, until her palm lay in his."
"With trembling, gentle hands she pushed him from her; but even when the"
"sound of his footsteps had died away, she stood with eyes straining"
"into the gloom, in her breast a gladness so stifling that she raised"
her hands to still its tumult.
"Emerson, with the glow still upon him, felt a deep contentment which he"
did not trouble to analyze. It has been said that two opposite impulses
"may exist side by side in a man's mind, like two hostile armies which"
"have camped close together in the night, unrevealed to each other until"
the morning. To Emerson the dawn had not yet come. He had no thought of
"disloyalty to Mildred, but, after his fashion, took the feeling of the"
"moment unreflectively. His mood was averse to thought, and, moreover,"
the darkness forced him to give instant attention to his path. While
"the waters of the bay out to his right showed a ghostly gray, objects"
beneath the bluff where he walked were cloaked in impenetrable shadow.
"The air was damp with the breath of coming rain, and at rare intervals"
he caught a glimpse of the torn edges of clouds hurrying ahead of a
wind that was yet unfelt.
"When the black bulk of Marsh's cannery loomed ahead of him, he left the"
"gravel beach and turned up among the buildings, seeking to retrace his"
"former course. He noticed that once he had left the noisy shingle, his"
"feet made no sound in the soft moss. Thus it was that, as he turned the"
"corner of the first building, he nearly ran against a man who was"
within his reach.
"Since her return, Rosek had begun to come again, very careful not to"
"repeat his mistake, but not deceiving her at all.  Though his"
"self-control was as great as Fiorsen's was small, she felt he had not"
"given up his pursuit of her, and would take very good care that Daphne"
Wing was afforded every chance of being with her husband. But pride never
"let her allude to the girl.  Besides, what good to speak of her?  They"
"would both lie--Rosek, because he obviously saw the mistaken line of his"
"first attack; Fiorsen, because his temperament did not permit him to"
suffer by speaking the truth.
"Having set herself to endure, she found she must live in the moment,"
"never think of the future, never think much of anything. Fortunately,"
nothing so conduces to vacuity as a baby.  She gave herself up to it with
"desperation.  It was a good baby, silent, somewhat understanding.  In"
"watching its face, and feeling it warm against her, Gyp succeeded daily"
"in getting away into the hypnotic state of mothers, and cows that chew"
"the cud.  But the baby slept a great deal, and much of its time was"
"claimed by Betty.  Those hours, and they were many, Gyp found difficult."
"She had lost interest in dress and household elegance, keeping just"
"enough to satisfy her fastidiousness; money, too, was scarce, under the"
"drain of Fiorsen's irregular requirements.  If she read, she began almost"
"at once to brood.  She was cut off from the music-room, had not crossed"
its threshold since her discovery.  Aunt Rosamund's efforts to take her
"into society were fruitless--all the effervescence was out of that, and,"
"though her father came, he never stayed long for fear of meeting Fiorsen."
"In this condition of affairs, she turned more and more to her own music,"
"and one morning, after she had come across some compositions of her"
"girlhood, she made a resolution. That afternoon she dressed herself with"
"pleasure, for the first time for months, and sallied forth into the"
February frost.
"There was a woman once who loved a young man, not of her village, very"
"dearly. And he loved her, too, as dearly as she loved him, and he"
demanded her in marriage from her parents; but they refused. Why they
"refused I do not know, but probably because they did not consider the"
young man a proper person for their daughter to marry. Then he tried to
"run away with her, and nearly succeeded, but they were caught before"
they got clear of the village.
The young man had to leave the neighbourhood. The attempted abduction of
"a girl is an offence severely punishable by law, so he fled; and in"
"time, under pressure from her people, the girl married another man; but"
she never forgot. She lived with her husband quite happily; he was good
"to her, as most Burmese husbands are, and they got along well enough"
together. But there were no children.
"After some years, four or five, I believe, the former lover returned to"
his village. He thought that after this lapse of time he would be safe
"from prosecution, and he was, moreover, very ill."
"He was so ill that very soon he died, without ever seeing again the girl"
he was so fond of; and when she heard of his death she was greatly
"distressed, so that the desire of life passed away from her. It so"
happened that at this very time she found herself enceinte with her
"first child, and not long before the due time came for the child to be"
born she had a dream.
"She dreamt that her soul left her body, and went out into space and met"
there the soul of her lover who had died. She was rejoiced to meet him
"again, full of delight, so that the return of her soul to her body, her"
"awakening to a world in which he was not, filled her with despair. So"
"she prayed her lover, if it was now time for him again to be incarnated,"
"Mediterranean. But coal, he had found, had risen to a ruinous price in"
consequence of a recent strike among the miners in England; and for even
"the most trifling repairs he would have to wait at least a week, because"
the dock-yard people were already working over-time to make way for a
man-of-war. Credit of any sort was not to be had. His portage-bill bade
fair to swamp his insufficient cash resources--even although three of
his now scanty crew had already deserted. And who could foretell what
might happen to him if they should get wagging their tongues too freely
"in some wine-shop ashore! While, as if for climax, the Customs'"
authorities had been displaying a most suspicious interest in him and
"his ship. Under such circumstances, even a saint might have been"
"pardoned, as he pointed out, for showing a temper something short of"
seraphic.
"""And you've been doing me good turns--by your way of it--for some time"
"past,"" he continued, in a stifled, vehement whisper lest his voice"
"should still reach the receding boat. ""Though--"" He waved a claw-like"
"hand about him, words again failing him to describe adequately his"
"sufferings in consequence, as who should say, ""See the result for"
"yourself."""
"Slyne sat down on the sofa opposite him, not even condescending to"
"glance, in response to that invitation, round the squalid,"
"poverty-stricken little cabin. ""Never mind about some time past,"" he"
"advised, more pacifically. ""You'll never get rich quick yesterday."
"To-day's when _I'm_ going to make my pile. And I meant to let you in--"""
"""To another hole,"" Captain Dove concluded sceptically. ""I only wish"
"you'd show me some sure way out of the one I'm in."""
"Slyne looked his annoyance at that further interruption, and made as if"
"to rise, but did no more than draw his gold cigarette-case from its"
Somehow as she sat there it seemed to Mrs. Warren it was going for
her to be the last hour of fully conscious life--fully conscious and
yet a curious mingling in it of the past and present. She had sat
"here in the middle of the 'seventies with Vivie's father, the young"
"Irish seminarist, her lover for six months. He had a vague interest"
"in botany, and during his convalescence after his typhoid fever,"
"when she was still his nurse, not yet his mistress, she used to"
bring him here to rest and to enjoy the aspect of these ferns and
palms. What a strange variety of men she had known. Some she had
"loved, more or less; some she had exploited frankly. Some--like"
"George Crofts and Baxendale Strangeways--she had feared, though in"
her manner she had tried to conceal her dread of their violence.
"Well! she had taken a lot of money off the rich, but she had never"
plundered the poor. Her greatest conquest--and that when she was a
woman of forty--was the monarch of this very country which now lay
crushed under the Kaiser's heel. For a few months he had taken a
"whimsical liking to her handsome face, well-preserved figure, and"
amusing cockney talk. But he had employed her rather as the mistress
"of his menus plaisirs, as his recruiting agent. He had rewarded her"
handsomely. Now it was all in the dust: her beautiful Villa
Beau-séjour a befouled barrack for German soldiers. She herself a
"homeless woman, repudiated by the respectable British and Americans"
more or less interned in this unhappy city.
Not much more than a year ago she had been one of the most respected
"persons in Brussels, with a large income derived from safe"
investments. Now all she had for certain was something over three
thousand pounds in bank notes that might turn out next month to be
worthless paper. And was she certain even of them? Had Vivie before
"they left the hotel remembered to put some, at least, of this"
"precious sum on her person? Suppose, whilst they were out, looking"
"where the _Malplaquet_ was fitting out, and we left the rest to our"
personal charms.
"Cary was right. The Commander was a very fine fellow, an English naval"
officer of the best type. He confirmed the views I had frequently
heard expressed by others of his profession that no hatred exists
between English and German sailors. They leave that to middle-aged
"civilians who write for newspapers. The German Navy, in his opinion,"
"was ""a jolly fine Service,"" worthy in high courage and skill to"
contest with us the supremacy of the seas. He had been through the
China troubles as a lieutenant in the _Monmouth_--afterwards sunk by
"German shot off Coronel--knew von Spee, von Mueller, and other officers"
"of the Pacific Squadron, and spoke of them with enthusiasm. ""They sunk"
some of our ships and we wiped out theirs. That was all in the way of
business. We loved them in peace and we loved them in war. They were
splendidly loyal to us out in China--von Spee actually transferred
some of his ships to the command of our own senior officer so as to
"avoid any clash of control--and when it came to fighting, they fought"
like gentlemen. I grant you that their submarine work against merchant
"ships has been pretty putrid, but I don't believe that was the choice"
of their Navy. They got their orders from rotten civilians like Kaiser
"Bill."" Imagine if you can the bristling moustache of the Supreme War"
Lord could he have heard himself described as a civilian!
"Our guest had commanded a destroyer in the Jutland battle, and assured"
us that the handling of the German battle squadrons had been masterly.
"""They punished us heavily for just so long as they were superior in"
"strength, and then they slipped away before Jellicoe could get his"
blow in. They kept fending us off with torpedo attacks until the night
"came down, and then clean vanished. We got in some return smacks after"
"dark at stragglers, but it was very difficult to say how much damage"
"we did. Not much, I expect. Still it was a good battle, as decisive in"
"burned; but the prince loved her so very tenderly, that after much"
"pleading he succeeded in having her saved from punishment, though only"
with the greatest difficulty.

"When heaven gave her a second child, a guard of twice as many men as had"
first stood watch was again set about her; yet everything happened as
"before, only that this time the foster-mother said to her: ""Now you"
"shall grieve as I did when you let the moon slip out!"" The queen wept"
and pleaded--for when the foster-mother was there she could speak--but
without avail. Now the old queen insisted that she be burned. But the
prince once more succeeded in begging her free. When heaven gave her a
"third child, a three-fold guard was set about her. The foster-mother"
"came while the guard slept, took the child, cut its little finger, and"
"rubbed some of the blood on the queen's mouth. ""Now,"" said she, ""you"
"shall grieve just as I did when you let the sun slip out!"" And now the"
"prince could in no way save her, she was to be and should be burned."
"But at the very moment when they were leading her to the stake, the"
foster-mother appeared with all three children; the two older ones she
"led by the hand, the youngest she carried on her arm. She stepped up to"
"the young queen and said: ""Here are your children, for now I give them"
"back to you. I am the Virgin Mary, and the grief that you have felt is"
"the same grief that I felt aforetimes, when you had let the star, the"
moon and the sun slip out. Now you have been punished for that which you
"did, and from now on the power of speech is restored to you!"""
"The happiness which then filled the prince and princess may be imagined,"
"but cannot be described. They lived happily together ever after, and"
from that time forward even the prince's mother was very fond of the
"men here, not even your chief assistant or Trehayne, should know that"
you are joining the _Malplaquet_ as a Marine. Two independent strings
"are in this case better than a double-jointed string."""
"""I never tell anything to any one, least of all to Pudden-Headed"
"Wilson. He is loyal, but a stupid ass with a flapping tongue. Trehayne"
"is close as wax, but, on general principles, I keep my movements"
"strictly to myself. He will be in the ship, but he won't know that I"
"am there too. The Commander must know and the Major of Marines, for I"
"shall want a uniform and the free run of the ship, so as to be posted"
"where I like. The Marine Sergeants of the Guard may guess, but, as Mr."
"Cary says, they won't talk. You two gentlemen are safe,"" added Dawson"
"pleasantly, ""for I've got you tight in my hand and could lock either"
"of you up in a minute if I chose."""
"A peculiar knock came upon the door, a word passed between Dawson and"
"the police sentry outside, and a young man in the uniform of a naval"
"petty officer entered the room. He was clean-shaven, looked about"
"twenty-five years old, was dark and slim of the Latin type which is"
"not uncommon in Cornwall, and impressed me at once with his air of"
"intelligence and refinement. His voice, too, was rather striking. It"
was that of the wardroom rather than of the mess deck. I liked the
look of Petty Officer Trehayne. Dawson presented him to us and then
"took him aside for instructions. When he had finished, both men"
"rejoined us, and the conversation became light and general. Trehayne,"
though clearly suffering from nervous strain after his recent
"professional failures, talked with the ease and detachment of a highly"
cultivated man. It appeared that he had been educated at Blundell's
"School, had lost his parents at about sixteen, had done a course in"
"some electrical engineering shops at Plymouth, and when twenty years"
old had secured a good berth on the engineering staff of the _Vernon_.
"He could speak both French and German, which he had learned partly at"
"no designs against Gatepath, yet she could not forbear to triumph over"
"him. ""One never knows,"" she said, ""when one may need a devoted friend,"
"and need him badly. I always look forward."""
Two or three weeks later Madame found a letter at her club signed
"""Gatepaths."" It was the club in Dover Street with those steep steps down"
which the members tumble helplessly in frosty weather. Madame calls it
"""The Club of Falling Women."""
"It appears that Gatepath, hunting for an adviser of ripe wisdom, had"
"sought out the Chief of Dawson and lately of Madame, and laid bare his"
pressing troubles. The Chief is one of those rare men to whom all his
"friends, and they are as the stars in number, go seeking counsel in"
"their crimes and follies. Nothing shocks him, nothing surprises him. And"
"from the depths of his wise, humorous, sympathetic mind, he will almost"
"always draw waters of comfort. Suppose, for example, one had slain a man"
and urgently sought to dispose of the corpse--a not uncommon problem in
crowded cities--to whom could one more profitably turn than to the
"Chief of His Majesty's Detective Service? Or if, in a passing fit of"
"absence of mind, one had wedded three wives, and the junior in rank"
began to suspect the existence of one or more seniors; do we not all
suffer from lapses of memory? One does not put these problems before the
"Chief as one's own--there is a decent convention in these matters--but,"
"of course, he knows. To know all is to pardon all, and there is very"
little that the Chief does not know about you or me.
The family solicitor of peers and princes poured into the Chief's ear
the fantastic cause of his present distresses. He delivered himself of
"the story in all seriousness, for it was dreadfully serious to him."
"Never in all his experience, and in that of his century-old firm, had"
anything so dreadfully serious occurred. The Chief controlled himself
"until the end was reached, and then exploded in a yell of laughter."
"“The note’s for ten thousand, so that’s all straightened out,”"
"Bainbridge murmured, with a snap of his fingers. “The money from the"
stock can go for current expenses. I’ll fix it up this very night.”
He did. Fortunately Tweedy held his power of attorney with the right to
"sign checks and execute papers of any sort, so it was possible for him"
to put through these deals without his returning to Bangor. That another
note for nearly as much as the first fell due in little more than a
"fortnight Bainbridge knew quite well. By that time, however, he fully"
"intended to have the drive down as far as their mill at Lancaster, fifty"
miles or so above Bangor. And it is always possible to raise money on
"timber, even in the rough."
"Of course, if the trust continued their campaign of cutting prices Bob’s"
"plans would be materially affected. He could not believe, however, that"
they would do such a thing for any great length of time. A dollar meant
"as much to them as to any one, and even the pleasure of ruining a"
competitor would scarcely compensate for the loss of so much money.
A long letter of instruction and explanation was written to Tweedy that
"night, and despatched the first thing in the morning by the trusty hand"
"of Joe Moose, the Indian. That off his mind, Bob returned to his drive"
"with renewed vigor, for the necessity for haste was now even greater"
than before. It was a question of getting the logs down in double-quick
time or being dragged into the bankruptcy court; and that sort of
notoriety did not appeal in the least to the young man.
It was this feeling of necessity which got Bob up next morning before
the blackness of the night was more than faintly tinged by streaks of
pale gray in the east. He wanted to be off and doing; even necessary
inaction chafed. It seemed an eternity before the men had finished
"""Baron Ned says my letter must be short, so I smother what remnant of"

telling you plainly what I know you want to hear. I love only you and am
"true to you in every thought, word, and deed. I long for you, yearn for"
"you, pray for you, and be your fortune good or ill, I would share it and"

"""So I pray you, do not desert me in case your present hope of good"

by whom the good or evil of life is reckoned in the measure of her love;
her joy or misery being only a matter of down weight or light weight more
"in the love she gives than in that which she receives. Remember, also,"
"that in this letter I must condense when I might easily be prolix, and"
"that after all is written, probably I shall have left unsaid the very"
thing I most wished to say. But these three words will tell it all and
bear repeating: I love you.
"""FRANCES."""
And this from my sensible cousin! What would it be if her heart were not
balanced by a wise head?
"Our letters being written, I became alarmed about posting them in London,"
"not knowing when a messenger would start for France, nor who he would be."
"The next day Frances and I talked it over, and she suggested that as the"
"king and most of the court were about to visit Bath for a season, and as"
"wanted a hundred dollars for her, and this they paid, and thanked him"
kindly into the bargain.
"Then the merchant sailed on, but no sooner had he reached the high seas"
than he saw the cat sitting at the top of the main-mast. And immediately
"after another storm and tempest arose, far worse than the first one, and"
"he drifted and drifted, till he came to a land where he had never yet"
"been. Again the merchant went to a tavern, and here, too, the table was"
covered with switches; but they were much larger and longer than at the
place where he had first been. And they were much needed; for there were
"a good many more mice, and they were twice the size of those he had"
first seen.
"Here he again sold his cat, and this time he received two hundred"
"dollars for her, and that without any haggling. But when he had sailed"
"off and was out at sea a way, there sat the cat up in the mast. And the"
"storm at once began again, and finally he was again driven to a land in"
"which he had never been. Again he turned in at a tavern, and there the"
table was also covered with switches; but every switch was a yard and a
"half long, and as thick as a small broom, and the people told him that"
"they knew of nothing more disagreeable than to sit down to eat, for"
"there were great, ugly rats by the thousand. Only with toil and trouble"
could one manage to shove a bite of something into one's mouth once in a
"while, so hard was it to defend oneself against the rats. Then the cat"
"was again brought from the ship, and now the people could eat in peace."
They begged and pleaded that the merchant sell them his cat; and for a
long time he refused; but at last he promised that they should have her
"for three hundred dollars. And they paid him, and thanked him, and"
blessed him into the bargain.
"Now when the merchant was out at sea again, he considered how much the"
"boy had gained with the four-shilling piece he had given him. ""Well, he"
will touch his soul or disturb the image he has made of himself. The
attitude of warding off reveals itself as fastidiousness and as
bashfulness. Budaeus hit the mark when he exclaimed jocularly:
'_Fastidiosule!_ You little fastidious person!' Erasmus himself
interprets the dominating trait of his being as maidenly coyness. The
excessive sensitiveness to the stain attaching to his birth results from
"it. But his friend Ammonius speaks of his _subrustica verecundia_, his"
"somewhat rustic _gaucherie_. There is, indeed, often something of the"
"small man about Erasmus, who is hampered by greatness and therefore"
"shuns the great, because, at bottom, they obsess him and he feels them"
to be inimical to his being.
It seems a hard thing to say that genuine loyalty and fervent
gratefulness were strange to Erasmus. And yet such was his nature. In
characters like his a kind of mental cramp keeps back the effusions of
"the heart. He subscribes to the adage: 'Love so, as if you may hate one"
"day, and hate so, as if you may love one day'. He cannot bear benefits."
In his inmost soul he continually retires before everybody. He who
"considers himself the pattern of simple unsuspicion, is indeed in the"
"highest degree suspicious towards all his friends. The dead Ammonius,"
"who had helped him so zealously in the most delicate concerns, is not"
"secure from it. 'You are always unfairly distrustful towards me,'"
"Budaeus complains. 'What!' exclaims Erasmus, 'you will find few people"
who are so little distrustful in friendship as myself.'
When at the height of his fame the attention of the world was indeed
"fixed on all he spoke or did, there was some ground for a certain"
feeling on his part of being always watched and threatened. But when he
"was yet an unknown man of letters, in his Parisian years, we continually"
find traces in him of a mistrust of the people about him that can only
be regarded as a morbid feeling. During the last period of his life this
"feeling attaches especially to two enemies, Eppendorf and Aleander."
"But we had parted.  She had announced her intention of leaving Paris,"
"accompanied by her mother, on the morrow, and had begged and implored"
that I would never seek her again.
"""I shall take care to evade you,"" she had said.  ""To-day we meet for the"
last time.  We must each go our own way and strive our hardest to
"forget."""
"Ah! to forget would, I knew, be impossible.  When a man has loved as"
"ardently and intensely as I loved Yolande, memories cling to him and are"
"carried to the grave.  You, reader, have loved in those half-forgotten"
"days of long ago, and even now, with age creeping on, and, perchance,"
"with grey hairs showing, sometimes give a passing thought to that fair"
one who in youth's golden days was your all in all.  The sound of a
"song, the momentary perfume from a woman's chiffons as she passes, the"
"sight of some long-forgotten scene, stirs the memory and recalls those"
hours of love and laziness when the world was so very pleasant and
"seemed to have been made for you alone.  You recollect her sweet smile,"
"her calm, womanly influence, her full red lips, and the fervency of her"
"kisses.  The tender memory to-day is sweet, even though it be tinged"
"with bitterness, for you wonder whom she has married, and how she has"
"fared; you wonder, too, if you will ever meet again, or whether she is"
already dead.  The most charming reflection permitted to man is the
memory of a half-forgotten love.
I had been a fool.  This bitter truth was forced upon me as I sat there
"ruminating.  I had cast aside that patience and discretion which I, as a"
"diplomatist, had carefully cultivated, and had actually contemplated"
marriage with a woman who had been denounced by Kaye as a secret agent.
"My own peril had been a grave one indeed, and as I reflected I began to"
wonder how it was that I should have so completely lost my self-control.
"Church and State and society, seemed simple. Nothing was required but"
"restoration and purification by a return to the original, unspoilt"
"sources of Christianity. A number of accretions to the faith, rather"
"ridiculous than revolting, had to be cleared away. All should be reduced"
"to the nucleus of faith, Christ and the Gospel. Forms, ceremonies,"
speculations should make room for the practice of true piety. The Gospel
was easily intelligible to everybody and within everybody's reach. And
"the means to reach all this was good learning, _bonae literae_. Had he"
"not himself, by his editions of the New Testament and of Jerome, and"
"even earlier by the now famous _Enchiridion_, done most of what had to"
"be done? 'I hope that what now pleases the upright, will soon please"
all.' As early as the beginning of 1517 Erasmus had written to Wolfgang
"Fabricius Capito, in the tone of one who has accomplished the great"
"task. 'Well then, take you the torch from us. The work will henceforth"
be a great deal easier and cause far less hatred and envy. _We_ have
lived through the first shock.'
Budaeus writes to Tunstall in May 1517: 'Was anyone born under such
inauspicious Graces that the dull and obscure discipline (scholasticism)
"does not revolt him, since sacred literature, too, cleansed by Erasmus's"
"diligence, has regained its ancient purity and brightness? But it is"
still much greater that he should have effected by the same labour the
"emergence of sacred truth itself out of that Cimmerian darkness, even"
though divinity is not yet quite free from the dirt of the sophist
"school. If that should occur one day, it will be owing to the beginnings"
made in our times.' The philologist Budaeus believed even more firmly
than Erasmus that faith was a matter of erudition.
It could not but vex Erasmus that not everyone accepted the cleansed
"truth at once. How could people continue to oppose themselves to what,"
"to him, seemed as clear as daylight and so simple? He, who so sincerely"
"would have liked to live in peace with all the world, found himself"
"anything, risk anything, and suffer anything to shield her from the"
"filthy Germans, I rejoice that she has in her service such supremely"
efficient guardians as this most wickedly unscrupulous Dawson. There
"is, at any rate, not a trace of our English muddle about him."""
"""Ours is a righteous cause,"" cried poor Cary desperately. ""We are"
"fighting for right against wrong, for defence against aggression, for"
civilisation against utter barbarism. We are by instinct clean
"fighters. If in the stress of conflict we stoop to foul methods, can"
we ever wash away the filth of them from our souls? We shall stand
before the world nakedly confessed as the nation of hypocrites we have
"always been declared to be."""
"""Cary,"" I said, ""you make me tired. We cannot be too thankful that we"
"possess Dawsons to counterplot against the Germans, and that"
personally we are in no way responsible for the morality of their
methods. Come off the roof and get back to this most interesting
"affair of the _Antinous_. I presume one of Dawson's men was working,"
"unknown to his fellows, with the care and maintenance party, and"
"another, equally unknown, with the engineers who were busy upon the"
gearing of the turbines. Many of the regular ship's officers and men
would also have been on board. Had our remarkable friend his agents
among them too? Everything is possible with Dawson; I should not be
"surprised to hear that he had police officers in the Fleet flagship."""
"""You are almost right. One of his men, a temporary petty officer of"
"R.N.V.R., was certainly on board, and he tells me that down in the"
engine room was another--a civilian fitter. They were both first-class
"men. The electric wires, as you know, are carried about the ship under"
"the deck beams, where they are accessible for examination and repairs."
"They are coiled in cables from which wires are led to the switch room,"
"and thence to all parts of the ship. There are thousands of wires, and"
The dozen men who had been slinging freight on the dock hastened up the
"gang-plank or climbed the fenders, while the signal-man clung to the"
"lifting tackle, and, at the piping cry of his whistle, was swung aloft"
out of the very arms of the rioters.
"Above, on the flying bridge, Captain Peasley was bellowing orders; a"
quartermaster was running up the iron steps to the pilot-house; on deck
the sailors were fighting their way to their posts through the ranks of
the raging fishermen and the shrieking confusion of the Orientals; the
"last men aboard, with a ""Heave Ho!"" in unison, slid the gang-plank"
"upward and out of reach. The neighboring roofs, lately so black, were"
"emptying now, the onlookers hastening to join in the attack."
Big George alone remained upon the wharf. As he saw the rush coming he
had ordered his men to abandon their load; then he ran to the
"after-mooring, and, taking slack from a deck hand, cast it off. Back up"
"the dock he went to the forward hawser, where, at a signal, he did the"
"same, moving, toward the last, without excessive hurry, as if in a"
"spirit of bravado. The ship was clear, and he had not cut a hawser. He"
had done his work; all but a ton or two of the cargo was stowed. There
was no longer cause for delay.
"""Get aboard! Are you mad?"" Emerson shouted, but the cry never reached"
"him. Back he came slowly, in front of the press, secure in his"
"tremendous strength, defiance in his every move, a smouldering"
challenge in his eyes; and noting that gigantic frame with its
"square-hewn, flaming face, not one of his enemies dared oppose him. But"
"as he passed they yapped and snarled and jostled at his heels, hungry"
to rend him and only lacking courage.
"As yet the ship, although throbbing to the first pulsations of her"
"engines, lay snug along the piling, but gradually her stern swung off"
"and throwing down great loops of rope. Under the trees, growing along"
"the ground, were smaller creepers full of thorns, that tore the wayfarer"
"and barred his progress. The forest, too, was full of snakes that crept"
"along the ground, so like in their gray and yellow skins to the earth"
they travelled on that the traveller trod upon them unawares and was
bitten; and some so beautiful with coral red and golden bars that men
would pick them up as some dainty jewel till the snake turned upon them.
Here and there in this forest were little glades wherein there were
"flowers. Beautiful flowers they were, with deep white cups and broad"
glossy leaves hiding the purple fruit; and some had scarlet blossoms
"that nodded to and fro like drowsy men, and there were long festoons of"
white stars. The air there was heavy with their scent. But they were all
"full of thorns, only you could not see the thorns till after you had"
plucked the blossom.
"This wood was pierced by roads. Many were very broad, leading through"
"the forest in divers ways, some of them stopping now and then in the"
"glades, others avoiding them more or less, but none of them were"
"straight. Always, if you followed them, they bent and bent until after"
"much travelling you were where you began; and the broader the road, the"
"softer the turf beneath it; the sweeter the glades that lined it, the"
quicker did it turn.
"One road there was that went straight, but it was far from the others."
It led among the rocks and cliffs that bounded one side of the valley.
"It was very rough, very far from all the glades in the lowlands. No"
"flowers grew beside it, there was no moss or grass upon it, only hard"
"sharp rocks. It was very narrow, bordered with precipices."
"There were many lights in this wood, lights that flamed out like sunsets"
"and died, lights that came like lightning in the night and were gone."
calls himself in writing to Colet. But again he cannot help giving
"himself credit for acknowledging that quality, nay, converting that"
"quality itself into a virtue: it is modesty, the opposite of boasting"
and self-love.
This bashfulness about himself is the reason that he does not love his
"own physiognomy, and is only persuaded with difficulty by his friends to"
sit for a portrait. His own appearance is not heroic or dignified enough
"for him, and he is not duped by an artist who flatters him: 'Heigh-ho,'"
"he exclaims, on seeing Holbein's thumbnail sketch illustrating the"
"_Moria_: 'if Erasmus still looked like that, he would take a wife at"
once'. It is that deep trait of dissatisfaction that suggests the
inscription on his portraits: 'his writings will show you a better
image'.
Erasmus's modesty and the contempt which he displays of the fame that
fell to his lot are of a somewhat rhetorical character. But in this we
should not so much see a personal trait of Erasmus as a general form
"common to all humanists. On the other hand, this mood cannot be called"
"altogether artificial. His books, which he calls his children, have not"
turned out well. He does not think they will live. He does not set store
by his letters: he publishes them because his friends insist upon it. He
writes his poems to try a new pen. He hopes that geniuses will soon
"appear who will eclipse him, so that Erasmus will pass for a stammerer."
What is fame? A pagan survival. He is fed up with it to repletion and
would do nothing more gladly than cast it off.
Sometimes another note escapes him. If Lee would help him in his
"endeavours, Erasmus would make him immortal, he had told the former in"
"their first conversation. And he threatens an unknown adversary, 'If you"
"go on so impudently to assail my good name, then take care that my"
"gentleness does not give way and I cause you to be ranked, after a"
to such a futile little house; he could have smashed in the former with
"a blow of his fist, and he could have jumped into the latter through the"
first-floor windows. With his great bulk he felt himself absurdly out
of scale. The tragedy looming huge in his mind was also absurdly out
of scale with his errand. The house was one of a row of twenty
"perky, gabled, two-storied little villas, each coyly shrinking to"
"the farthermost limit of its tiny front garden, and each guarding the"
"privacy of its interior by means of muslin curtains at the windows, tied"
"back by ribbons, the resultant triangle of transparency being obscured"
by a fat-leafed plant. The terrace bore the name of “Tregarthion
"Villas,” and the one inhabited by Miss Lindon was called “The Oaks.” It"
was a sham little terrace full of sham little gentilities. John hated
it. What could have induced his mother's sister to inhabit such a sphere
of flimsiness?
"Flimsiness, also, met him inside, when he was shown through a"
bamboo-furnished passage into a gimcrack little drawing-room. He tried
"several chairs dubiously with his hand, shook his head, and seated"
himself on a couch. Everything in the room seemed flimsy and futile.
He had the impression that everything save a sham spinning-wheel and a
half-solved jig-saw puzzle on the little table was draped in muslin and
"tied up with pink ribbons. A decrepit black-and-tan terrier, disturbed"
"in his slumbers in front of the fire, barked violently. A canary in a"
cage by the window sang in discordant emulation. John poised his hat and
"stick on the curved and slippery satin-covered couch, and they fell with"
a clatter to the floor. The frown deepened on his brow. Why had he come
to this distracting abode of mindlessness? He wished he had brought
Herold gyved and manacled. What with the dog and the canary and the
"doll's-house furniture, the sensitive and fastidious one would have gone"
mad. He would have gloated over his ravings. It would have served him
right.
"blossoms. She had enemies, of course. Most of the other queens were her"
"enemies, and tried to do her harm. But it was useless telling tales of"
"her to the king, for the king never believed; and she walked so wisely"
"and so well, that she never fell into any snare. But still the plots"
never ceased.
"There was one day when she was sitting alone in the garden pavilion,"
"with the trees making moving shadows all about her, that the king came"
"to her. They talked for a time, and the king began to speak to her of"
"her life before she came to the palace, a thing he had never done"
"before. But he seemed to know all about it, nevertheless, and he spoke"
"to her of her brother, and said that he, the king, had heard how no man"
"was so strong as this blacksmith, the brother of the queen. The queen"
"said it was true, and she talked on and on and praised her brother, and"
"babbled of the days of her childhood, when he carried her on his great"
"shoulder, and threw her into the air, catching her again. She was"
"delighted to talk of all these things, and in her pleasure she forgot"
"her discretion, and said that her brother was wise as well as strong,"
and that all the people loved him. Never was there such a man as he. The
"king did not seem very pleased with it all, but he said only that the"
"blacksmith was a great man, and that the queen must write to him to come"
"down to the city, that the king might see him of whom there was such"
great report.
"Then the king got up and went away, and the queen began to doubt; and"
the more she thought the more she feared she had not been acting wisely
"in talking as she did, for it is not wise to praise anyone to a king."
"She went away to her own room to consider, and to try if she could hear"
"of any reason why the king should act as he had done, and desire her"
brother to come to him to the city; and she found out that it was all a
"plot of her enemies. Herself they had failed to injure, so they were now"
"plotting against her through her brother. They had gone to the king, and"
Some days after this a strange report was brought to the palace. By the
landing-place near the spot where the fire had been was a great
"fig-tree. It was so near to the landing-place, and was such a"
"magnificent tree, that travellers coming from the boats, or waiting for"
"a boat to arrive, would rest in numbers under its shade. But the report"
said that something had happened there. To travellers sleeping beneath
"the tree at night it was stated that two Nats had appeared, very large"
"and very beautiful, a man Nat and a woman Nat, and had frightened them"
"very much indeed. Noises were heard in the tree, voices and cries, and a"
"strange terror came upon those who approached it. Nay, it was even said"
"that men had been struck by unseen hands and severely hurt, and others,"
"it was said, had disappeared. Children who went to play under the tree"
"were never seen again: the Nats took them, and their parents sought for"
"them in vain. So the landing-place was deserted, and a petition was"
"brought to the king, and the king gave orders that the tree should be"
"hewn down. So the tree was cut down, and its trunk was thrown into the"
"river; it floated away out of sight, and nothing happened to the men"
"who cut the tree, though they were deadly afraid."
"The tree floated down for days, until at last it stranded near a"
"landing-place that led to a large town, where the governor of these"
parts lived; and at this landing-place the portents that had frightened
the people at the great city reappeared and terrified the travellers
"here too, and they petitioned the governor."
"The governor sought out a great monk, a very holy man learned in these"
"matters, and sent him to inquire, and the monk came down to the tree and"
"spoke. He said that if any Nats lived in the tree, they should speak to"
"him and tell him what they wanted. 'It is not fit,' he said, 'for great"
Nats to terrify the poor villagers at the landing-place. Let the Nats
speak and say what they require. All that they want shall be given.' And
the Nats spake and said that they wanted a place to live in where they
"And so, besides dethroning the Burmese king, and occupying his golden"
"palace, we are ousting from their pleasant homes the guardian spirits of"
"the trees. They flee before the cold materialism of our belief, before"
the brutality of our manners. The headman did not say this; he did not
"mean to say this, for he is a very courteous man and a great friend of"
"all of us; but that is what it came to, I think."
"The trunk of this tree is more than ten feet through--not a round bole,"
"but like the pillar in a Gothic cathedral, as of many smaller boles"
growing together; and the roots spread out into a pedestal before
entering the ground. The trunk does not go up very far. At perhaps
twenty-five feet above the ground it divides into a myriad of smaller
"trunks, not branches, till it looks more like a forest than a single"
tree; it is full of life still. Though the pigeons and the doves come
"here no longer, there are a thousand other birds flitting to and fro in"
their aerial city and chirping to each other. Two tiny squirrels have
"just run along a branch nearly over my head, in a desperate hurry"
"apparently, their tails cocked over their backs, and a sky blue"
chameleon is standing on the trunk near where it parts. There is always
"a breeze in this great tree; the leaves are always moving, and there is"
a continuous rustle and murmur up there. A mango-tree and tamarind near
by are quite still. Not a breath shakes their leaves; they are as still
"as stone, but the shadow of the fig-tree is chequered with ever-changing"
"lights. Is the Nat really gone? Perhaps not; perhaps he is still there,"
"still caring for his tree, only shy now and distrustful, and therefore"
no more seen.
"Whole woods are enchanted sometimes, and no one dare enter them. Such a"
"wood I know, far away north, near the hills, which is full of Nats."
"There was a great deal of game in it, for animals sought shelter there,"
"and no one dared to disturb them; not the villagers to cut firewood, nor"
But here Grey stood firm.  Nothing would induce him to cumber his head
with one of those mountains of hair.  In vain the perruquiers displayed
"their wares; in vain Lord Sandford bantered and laughed, and made out"
that he would be reckoned as a mad fellow by the young bloods of the
city.  Grey would not yield an inch.  He had always found his own hair
"sufficient and comfortable, and he would wear it to the end.  And as the"
"discomfited perruquier at last departed, Lord Sandford broke into"
another of his great laughs.
"""I’ faith you are right, man.  I like you the better that you have the"
"courage of your opinions, and care no whit for fashion.  You’ll be a"
match for more than the perruquiers yet.  There’s a fighting strain in
"your blood.  I can see it in the glint of your eye. Well, you shall not"
lack opportunity to fight as well as to laugh here in London town; but
we’ll not have cold steel or hot lead again.  I’ve seen enough of that
"cursed duelling to last me for a lifetime."""
Grey was quickly to discover the nature of the battles in which he was
"to take a part, and at the first he shrank from them with an instinctive"
"aversion he could not well have defined, being no grave moralist or"
philosopher.  Contests of skill or of luck at the gaming tables were all
"the rage of the day with the young dandies of the town, and the man who"
"could keep a steady head, and in some cases a steady hand, was certain"
in the long run to obtain advantage over his fellows.  At one club a
"game something like our modern billiards was all the rage; and, of"
"course, a man who was moderate in his cups could score heavily over the"
"reckless, dissipated bloods, who were seldom sober after sundown.  Dice"
and cards had their vogue at other places; and though some of the games
"played were those purely of chance, others required no small skill and a"
"clear head to ensure success, and it was here that Lord Sandford’s"
strong head and Grey’s cool blood and temperate habits gave them the
advantage.
though he himself were the captain. The captain asked what sort of
"nonsense this might be, and whether he had ever heard of a cabin-boy's"
being entrusted with the command of a ship. But the boy answered that
was all one to him; if they did not care to buy the three cords of
"birch-wood, and obey him, as though he were captain, for the space of a"
single day--the captain and crew should know which day it was to be in
"advance--then he would set foot on the ship no more, and far less would"
he ever dirty his hands with pitch and tar on her again. The whole thing
"seemed strange to the captain, yet he finally gave in, because he wanted"
"to have the boy along with him and, no doubt, he also thought that"
he would come to his senses again when they were once under way. The
"quartermaster was of the same opinion. ""Just let him command all he"
"likes, and if things go wrong with him, we'll help him out,"" said he. So"
"the birch-wood was bought, full-measure and without haggling, and they"
set sail.
"When the day came on which the cabin-boy was to take command, the"
"weather was fair and quiet; but he drummed up the whole ship's crew, and"
"with the exception of a tiny bit of canvas, had all sails reefed. The"
"captain and crew laughed at him, and said: ""That shows the sort of a"
captain we have now. Don't you want us to reef that last bit of sail
"this very minute?"" ""Not yet,"" answered the cabin-boy, ""but before long."""
"Suddenly a squall struck them, struck them so heavily that they thought"
"they would capsize, and had they not reefed the sails they would"
undoubtedly have foundered when the first breaker roared down upon the
ship.
"The boy ordered them to throw the first cord of birch-wood overboard,"
"billet by billet, one at a time and never two, and he did not let them"
"touch the other two cords. Now they obeyed him to the letter, and did"
not laugh; but cast out the birch-wood billet by billet. When the last
"sitting in my room talking to them, when a knock came at the door, and"
"I found there a poor woman belonging to the neighbourhood, but who also"
combined in my dream the page-boy at a dear friend's house. From this
"friend, whom I had not heard from for some time, the woman bore a large"
"letter. She tore it open in my presence, saying, ""It says here that the"
"bearer is to open this,"" and produced from it another letter, a large"
document of a legal character in my friend's handwriting. When the woman
began to open the second letter I remonstrated; I was sure that there was
"some mistake, that that letter was private, and that no one else ought to"
"see it. The woman, however, firmly insisted that she must carry out her"
instructions; so we had a long discussion. After a time I called Mrs. F.
and appealed to her. She agreed with me that the instructions must only
"mean that the bearer was to open the outer envelope, not the inner letter."
"At last I took out five shillings and gave it to the woman, telling her"
that I would assume all the responsibility for opening the letter myself.
"With this she went away well satisfied, saying (as she would in real"
"life), ""All right, Mrs. ----, you're a lady, and you know. All right,"
"my dear."" Then at last I was able to tear open my letter and read these"
"words: ""_Always use Sunlight Soap_."" My vexation was extreme.'"
On another occasion the same dreamer experienced remorse. She imagined she
"was in a restaurant, and the girl behind the counter pointed to a barrel"
"of beer--a golden barrel, she said, with a magic key--which could only be"
"opened by the owner. The dreamer declared, however, that she could open"
"it, and, producing a key, proceeded to do so, handing round beer to the"
"bystanders. Then she realised that she had been stealing, and was full of"
"remorse. She asked a friend if she ought to tell the owner, but the friend"
"replied, 'By no means.' This conclusion of the dream seems to indicate"
"that the moral sense, though present in dreams, is apt to be impaired."
In yet another dream this dreamer exhibited a curious combination of moral
"sensibility and criminal indifference. She imagined that, while walking"
Lady Blount sighed. What with imperial governments that wrecked the
"career of men for shooting a few murderous and fire-raising blacks, and"
"with lowborn vixens of women who ruined men's careers in other ways,"
"life was a desperate puzzle. She was fond of her cousin John Risca. She,"
"too, before she married Sir Oliver, had borne the name, and the disgrace"
that had fallen upon it affected her deeply. It was horrible to think
"of John's wife, locked up that night in the stone cell of a gaol. She"
"leaned back in her chair in silence while the men talked--Sir Oliver,"
"by way of giving Risca hints on the conduct of life in Melbourne, was"
narrating his experiences of forty years ago in the West Indies--and
"stared into the fire. Her face, beneath the front of red hair that"
"accused so pitifully the reddish gray that was her own, looked very old"
"and faded. What was a prison like? She shuddered. As governor's wife,"
she had once or twice had occasion to visit a colonial prison. But the
"captives were black, and they grinned cheerily; their raiment, save for"
"the unæsthetic decoration of the black arrow, was not so very different"
"from that which they wore in a state of freedom; neither were food,"
"bedding, and surroundings so very different; and the place was flooded"
with air and blazing sunshine. She could never realize that it was
a real prison. It might have been a prison of musical comedy. But an
"English prison was the real, unimaginable abode of grim, gray horror."
She had heard of the prison taint. She conceived it as a smell--that of
mingled quicklime and the corruption it was to destroy--which lingered
physically forever after about the persons of those who had been
"confined within prison-walls. A gaol was a place of eternal twilight,"
"eternal chill, eternal degradation for the white man or woman; and a"
"white woman, the wife of one of her own race, was there. It was almost"
"as if the taint hung about her own lavender-scented self. She shivered,"
and drew her chair a few inches nearer the fire.
"Was it so preposterous, after all, on John Risca's part to fly from the"
"shame into a wider, purer air? Her cry had been unthinking, instinctive,"
When you are alone in the forest all this life will come and talk to
"you, if you are quiet and understand. There is love deep down in the"
"passionate heart of the flower, as there is in the little quivering"
"honeysucker flitting after his mate, as there was in Romeo long ago."
There is majesty in the huge brown precipice greater than ever looked
from the face of a king. All life is one. The soul that moves within you
when you hear the deer call to each other far above in the misty meadows
of the night is the same soul that moves in everything about you. No
people who have lived much with Nature have failed to descry this. They
"have recognised the life, they have felt the sympathy of the world about"
"them, and to this life they have given names and forms as they would to"
"friends whom they loved. Fairies and goblins, fauns and spirits, these"
are but names and personifications of a real life. But to him who has
"never felt this life, who has never been wooed by the trees and hills,"
"these things are but foolishness, of course."
"To the Burman, not less than to the Greek of long ago, all nature is"
"alive. The forest and the river and the mountains are full of spirits,"
"whom the Burmans call Nats. There are all kinds of Nats, good and bad,"
"great and little, male and female, now living round about us. Some of"
"them live in the trees, especially in the huge fir-tree that shades half"
an acre without the village; or among the fernlike fronds of the
"tamarind; and you will often see beneath such a tree, raised upon poles"
"or nestled in the branches, a little house built of bamboo and thatch,"
perhaps two feet square. You will be told when you ask that this is the
"house of the Tree-Nat. Flowers will be offered sometimes, and a little"
"water or rice maybe, to the Nat, never supposing that he is in need of"
"such things, but as a courteous and graceful thing to do; for it is not"
"safe to offend these Nats, and many of them are very powerful. There is"
"a Nat of whom I know, whose home is in a great tree at the crossing of"
"two roads, and he has a house there built for him, and he is much"
is perilously near its antithetic decline. This basic change puzzles us
by its seeming caprice not merely in our physical instruments but also
in the cycle of individual life and death and in the great cycle of the
life and death of nations. We fail to see things in their totality and
we erect barriers that keep kindreds apart. Even science which attempts
"to rise above common limitations, has not escaped the doom which limited"
"vision imposes. We have caste in science as in religion and in politics,"
which divides one into conflicting many. The law of Cyclic change
follows us relentlessly even in the realm of thought. When we have
"raised ourselves to the highest pinnacle, through some oversight we fall"
over the precipice. Men have offered their lives for the establishment
of truth. A climax is reached after which the custodians of knowledge
themselves bar further advance. Men who have fought for liberty impose
on themselves and on others the bond of slavery. Through centuries have
men striven to erect a mighty edifice in which Humanity might be
enshrined; through want of vigilance the structure crumbled into dust.
Many cycles must yet be run and defeats must yet be borne before man
will establish a destiny which is above change.
And through science I was able to teach you to seek for truth and help
to discover it yourself. This attitude of detachment may possess some
"advantage in the proper understanding of your duties. You will have,"
"besides, the heritage of great ideals that have been handed down to"
"you. The question which you have to decide is duty to yourself, to the"
king and to your country. I shall speak to you of the ideals which we
cherish about these duties.
DUTY TO SELF
"As regards duty to self, can there be anything so inclusive as being"
true to your manhood? Stand upright and do not be either cringing or
father had to go forth to see whether he could not find a god-father
to pay for the child's christening. All day long he went from one to
"another; but no one wanted to be the god-father. Toward evening, as he"
"was going home, he met a very lovely lady, who wore the most splendid"
"clothes, and seemed most kind and friendly, and she offered to see that"
"the child was christened, if she might be allowed to keep it afterward."
The man replied that first he must ask his wife. But when he reached
"home and asked her she gave him a flat ""no."" The following day the man"
set out again; but no one wanted to be the god-father if he had to pay
"for the christening himself, and no matter how hard the man begged, it"
"was all of no avail. When he went home that evening, he again met the"
"lovely lady, who looked so gentle, and she made him the same offer as"
"before. The man again told his wife what had happened to him, and added"
"that if he could not find a god-father for his child the following day,"
"they would probably have to let the lady take her, since she seemed to"
"be so kind and friendly. The man then went out for the third time, and"
"found no god-father that day. And so, when he once more met the friendly"
"lady in the evening, he promised to let her have the child, if she would"
see that it was baptized. The following morning the lady came to the
"man's hut, and with her two other men. She then took the child and went"
"to church with it, and it was baptized. Then she took it with her,"
"and the little girl remained with her for several years, and her"
foster-mother was always good and kind to her.
"Now when the girl had grown old enough to make distinctions, and had"
"acquired some sense, it chanced that her foster-mother once wished to"
"take a journey. ""You may go into any room you wish,"" she said to the"
"girl, ""only you are not to go into these three rooms,"" and then she set"
out on her journey. But the girl could not resist opening the door
to the one room a little way--and swish! out flew a star. When her
"foster-mother came home, she was much grieved to find that the star had"
"flown out, and was so annoyed with her foster-child that she threatened"
KEEP TRACK.

- Did you hear Jo?
Where am I?
Who are you?
"Aw, c'mon, no games."
It's been a long day already.
Whose cigarette is that?
"Oh, Mary save us!"
They're repulsive.
Pamela.
"I'm not Pamela, I'm Sister Mary Maude."
What's with the Irish accent?
- I don't know.
"- Oh, you're a nun?"
With an MA in classical languages.
"Oh, I get it!"
The old split personality defence.
Classic.
- I don't know what you mean.
- She's lying.
All Right.
Would you also like to test me Greek?
"- This is not gonna work, Pamela."
- Stop calling me Pamela.
"Pamela, Pamela."
Pamela.
"Have another cigarette, Pamela."
Whoo!

I'LL CALL YOU AS SOON AS I KNOW ANYTHING.

"WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG, SAM?"
ARE YOU LOSING YOUR TOUCH?

"OKAY, MY FINGERS ARE BLEEDING NOW."
THERE'S SOME PAIN INVOLVED.
"YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE AROUND HERE"

I WONDER WHAT DOUG WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT.
"COME ON, BABY."

"Oh, some horse he's gonna bet on, I expect."
"You're looking very spruce this morning, Major."
"- St. George's Day, old boy."
- Really?
"Got a horse, have you?"
What's his name?
"Did you catch it, dear?"
"Dragonfly, Major."
"- Going to have a flutter, Fawlty?"
"- No, no, no, no, no."
"No, Basil doesn't bet anymore, Major."
"Do you, dear?"
"No, I don't, dear, no."
That particular avenue of pleasure has been closed off for me.

"Tom, what are you doing here?"
Are all the bars closed?
Just visiting some old friends.

"Yeah, old friends."
Goddamn it.

He was in the Polish Hill files.
"Hey, Tom."
What are those?
What is that?
What?
This?
"Nothing, just some papers."
"As the Italians say, ""Don't scald your tongue on another man's soup."""
There's an Irish saying:

I knew this was going to happen.
"You just won't let go, will you?"
I can't lay down on this.
My father's in a grave...
That's it.
Mm-Hmm.
Yeah.
Daddy's funny that way.
Between the smokin' can and
"The street hockey take, we got"
Almost 2 grand here.
It's unbelievable.
"Why don't we call a truce, OK?"
"We all quit smoking anyway, so"
Why don't we call a truce and
Buy something we really need.
New ipod.
How about a boom box.
"Come on, a new microwave."
"That oven is so old, it's"
Leaking microwaves when it's not
Even on.
Pretty soon we're all gonna be
Growing an extra cock and a pair
Of tits.
"Look at me, come on."
I'm halfway there.
"An ipod can hold 35,000"

[Moaning] Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
"- Good morning, Klinger."
"- Good morning, darling."
"- Come again, snookums?"
- Huh?
Oh.
"I'm sorry, sir."
It's a letter from Laverne.
Laverne... the ex-missus who left you high and dry for that butcher boy?
Morty's a sausage maker.
That's below butcher in the Toledo social register.
"But everything's changed now, sir."
Listen to what I read so far.
"""Dear Maxie, You are much in my mind these days."
"""Taking up with Morty was a terrible mistake."
"The man's soul is made of animal by-products."""
"Guess that makes you feel pretty happy, huh?"
- Seeing the sausage king put through the old grinder.
"- It's more than that, sir."
Can't you read between the lines?
She wants me back.
"Oh, that's music to my eyes!"
"Oh, right, right, right."

It's so twinkly.
"It's a rose-cut diamond, from India."

I can't stop looking at it.
"Nicky, see this ring?"
"Hint, hint."
"No one does subtlety like you, babe."

I have two kids here.
What are you talking about?
"That, I..."
[chuckles]
"Human stuff, huh?"
"Hey, let me see."
Oh!
Oh!
Look at this.
Wow.
This is special.
"This is very, very unusual."
- What?
What is it?
- It's a dinglehopper.
Humans use these little babies... to straighten their hair out.
See?
Just a little twirl here and a yank there and violee...
Ya got an aesthetically pleasing configuration of hair that humans go nuts over.
A dinglehopper.
- What about that one?
- Ah!
This I haven't seen in years.
This is wonderful!
"- A banded, bulbous snarfblatt."
- [Both] Oh!
The snarfblatt dates to prehistorical times when humans used to sit around and stare at each other all day.
Got very boring.
"So, they invented this snarfblatt to make fine music."
Allow me.
- [Scuttle coughs]
- Music!
- It's stuck!
"- Oh, the concert!"
"Oh, my gosh!"
My father's gonna kill me!
- Yeah.
Because we're bros.
OLDER TED:
"While I was racing through the streets of New York, trying to get back to the bar, your Aunt Robin was doing her best to keep Jim away from Maggie."
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
Do you want to go back to the bar and see if Maggie's still there?
(EX CLAIMS) No way!
I love erotic dog photography.
Did you see the one over there of the corgis doing it people style?
(ROBIN LAUGHING)
I'll get us a taxi.
I just feel bad leaving Maggie all alone.
No!
Let's have a glass of wine first.

"Give it a rest, jeez!"
She's hanging out with Ted tonight.
- Ted?
What about David?
- They broke up.
Maggie's single?
Do you think I'm a magician?
New York City is a big place.
How am I supposed to find Alex Bohemia?
Kind of like finding a penguin in a sandstorm.
You sure you got the right address?
You boys think this is Atlantic City?
"Jeremy, pick up your milk money and get inside!"
I'm sorry.

So what does that make him?
Appeased?
Now we need a hero.

"He's right over there, Mr. Malvado."
"Thank you, preciosa."
I'll have my usual.

Oh!
"Whoa, whoa."
"Easy there, compadre."
"Should I take my shoes off, too?"
Clean as a whistle.

It's been a way station for a thousand years.

"Not like the Twister, though, huh?"
"No, more, uh, truckers than desperadoes in here."

"- Yeah, he's not bad."
You got a Mickey Mouse on the bill today?
"No, not today."
"What, no Mickey Mouse?"
"- No, no Mickey Mouse."

He's making a personal appearance in Jersey City.
"Oh, you're trying to kid somebody, huh?"

"- But yeah, yeah."

- I am glad.
I say only so much that was Helebrant second lieutenant till now my room-mate.
"But, if I return onto the front, the your dear Gyula your son gets into his place."
"This is beneficial because it surrounds the schoolhouse, a guard doubled where I live."
Oh my God.
"For my son, good man like this his commander."
We thank you.
Kind angel.
Oh what are you doing?
!
Na!
Mariska!
What are you doing?
Big Brother has such a tragic death
Can't I even make him an altar?
There's not enough space even for the living
Who cares about the dead!
You...
What?
What are you guys arguing about?
Don't you know that dad is sick?
"Brother Jin, please rest in peace!"
Hey!
What are you doing here?
Go away!
"Master Fan, I've a secret to tell you!"
What secret?
"We shouldn't talk here, I'll wait for you at hillside"
Come here quick!
Come here!
Hey!
I'm here!
What secret?
You really want to know?
Since I asked you out
I'll surely tell you!
Someone wants to kill you!
Who?
Who dares to kill me?
Say!
This man is very skillful
I don't think you can handle him!
Do you remember a year ago
At the pharmacy?
"Seventeen black, we won!"
Great!
"Fortunate in games of chance, unfortunate in games of love."
we won.
"What, thats all?"
yes.
Ok then
Thanks
Here.
You where splendid.
"Truly, you looked marvelous."
"Enough with the complements, you know that there is no room for them between us."
What time is the meeting?
Tonight at midnight.
And Uli?
He is carrying out a small mission.
You are becoming quite the dangerous Cassanova.
Me?
Why do you say that?
I have my reasons.
Should I bring Mr. Dinamo's car?
"No, bring mine!"
"Adriana, wait!"
wait.
What happened to you...you are quite the mess.
I was trying to stop a man from shooting a woman.
Who was he?
"I do not know, It was dark."
And who was she?
"Don't know, I only saw her shadow."
"Oh, sure."
"Ah,I see, there goes your ""ghost."""
Albert.
(Camilla starts crying)
"Oh, sweetie!"
Why don't you sort things out with him?
- Because I think it's too late.
- It's never too late.
"If you like him so much, why don't you commit yourself?"
"You know, it's probably just some sort of misunderstanding."
"Oh Camilla, now you got me going too."
"(light waltz, both girls laugh and cry at the same time)"
Hey... silly me.
I can be such a wise-ass.
Didn't I realise I was talking about myself?
Apparently not.
I needed one more push.
And that push came from an unexpected place.
(knocking on door)
May I come in?
Are you all right?
- Entrez.
I'm almost done.
- Sure?
We used to be lovers.
Can you believe that?
You and Pierre?
"Yes, I know."
I thought he was the love of my life.
Are we talking about the same person?
- Yeah.
Unfortunately.
- What happened?
- L'amour rend aveugle.
Open it!
Get out here.
Get out here!
Tell him to come out here.
- Tell him!
"- Do what he says, Dennis."
Thanks.
Please don't do this.
I got three kids.
Shut up!
I know he tripped the silent alarm.
I know there's a dozen cops out there just waiting to kill me.
Then how the hell do you think you're gonna get out of here?
Out the front door.
"OFFICER Dawkins, you are surrounded."
Drop your weapon or we will fire.
Drop your weapon!
Drop your weapon now!
Fire!
What the hell is this?

Commander McGarrett?
"This is about my sister, isn't it?"
"She disabled a smoke detector on board in the bathroom, which is a federal offense."
So we arrested her as soon as she landed.
Great.
Jail?
"Pussycat, nice."
"Station him, park him for a bit."
"Oh, there's another animal coming along, what's that animal?"
Kangaroo.
Kangaroo and a pussycat.
Yeah.
They're fighting.
Yeah.
Who's winning?
The pussycat.
Let the pussycat kill the kangaroo.
OK.
So who's won?
Pussycat.
That is your spirit animal.
"Aah, that's nice."
You could've been anything you wanted to be in the world and you chose a pussycat.
You're a curious goat.
"Yes, I know, but..."
What I need you to do now is call to your guide.
"Make the cries of the pussy cat to the heavens,"

"It's a very quiet pussy cat, Dermot."
"Sleet, Sleet, that's great, can we hold the goat for a second?"
"Keep going, Dermot."
Sounds like a very sad pussy cat.
Or an owl.
"Sounds more like an owl, doesn't it?"
More like a sort of...
"Imagine, just a bit angrier."

It is not easy anymore.
- Now taşıyamayabilirim own our property.
- As hundreds of wounded.
They love him.
Who does not love that?
"Gangsters, such as handbook o."
"Thank you, honey."
Good night.
"- Mike, you ettiriyorum promoted."
"Tomorrow, Rook'a to LA'ye I want you to aid shipments."
- Why not?
- Too much fun.
My daughters house beats.
Always use stops.
I do not trust him.
"- Well, Rook is a party man."
- So.
He carries the goods under the counter.
I stand here and had to protect the interests of Arment'in.
The problem is that not only protects their interests.
Arment'e tried to say but I did not listen to me.
What can I do?
The man's son.
So we need to go to the shipment to go somewhere I want to sağlamanı.
And all of them.
Mike ...
- Would you?
- Mm.
"And, well... kinky."
Filthy.
Just arseholes.
A pair of complete and utter kinked-up... filthy racist arseholes.
"We've just left a vulnerable young boy with a pair of not only instinctive killers, but heinous pervs."
You do realise I'm zipping my coat up and going back there?
"Yeah, and I'm coming with you."
Mitchell?
Yeah?
Mitchell?
Are you packing?
"Unpacking, still."
"Oh, boys."
Your phone rang.
"Oh, thank you."
It's a withheld number.
Which usually means something official.
"Like a job, say."
They've left a message.
- It won't be good news.
"- Oh, you don't know that."
- Put it on loudspeaker.
- Uh.
Go on.
"Please, please, please."
"Hello, John."
This is Nita Mawulawde.
- That's how you say it.
- Duh.
I'm calling in regard to your interview this morning.
What?
It's no good.
I can't understand a word you're saying.
And don't get artistic.
Just peel the bloomin' thing.
Harris tweed.
Your father had a suit not dissimilar to this one.
I remember.
It lasted him for years.
"It's a lovely colour, Janet."
Hmm.
That's as may be.
That's it.
"You don't think it a little heavy for the summer, Mr. Penhaligan?"
"No, the advantage of tweed, Miss Widdington, is that it allows the wearer to breathe, as it were, because of the openness of the weave."
- I see.
- I like it.
It's also very hard wearing.
And the price?
Um... just over three guineas.
"Oh, good Lord."
[Whispering]
"Oh, yes."
And that includes an extra pair of trousers.
And without?
"Zip or button fly, sir?"
"Zip, please."
[Penhaligan]:
2 pounds and 15 shillings.
Fine.
Shirts?
Certainly.
Farewell.
Tahile?
"You think you can escape from us, the Magic Knights of Estabul?"
What's happening?
An enemy raid from Estabul!
Red-armored knights are flooding in!
They're attacking us...
Red armor?
The Estabul Magic Knights?
"All hands, retreat!"
"Run into the woods, fall back and regroup!"
Sion!
Are you safe?
"No, not Tahile..."
He had left to fetch water.
He said we'd be safe as long as we stuck with Sion!
- What happened to Kiefer?
- I don't know.
Let's split up here.
"Tony, Fahle, you two go ahead."
We'll stall them here.
Sion!
Don't worry.
Go!
"There may still be survivors, including Kiefer."
You're going to save them?
It's impossible!
It does seem that way.
- See them?
- No.
What's wrong?
"Hurry and run, Roland brats!"
Why can't they see that?
Those fools!
It's me.
What!
?
I'll be right there.
"Chief, the medical team reports that Miya Shikitani has regained consciousness."
She's conscious...?
Dan...
Gai...
Oh...
Is it that time already?
Shall we go?
You haven't changed at all.
"I was just about your age, too."
How strange...
"For the past 17 years, you and I have lived together as one..."
From that day I first met you...
All this time...
Who... are you?
Protect it...
What is this?
Dangaioh.
Dangaioh...?
- You're almost there.
"Yeah, you got that."
Areyousure it's okay that we came here ?
"Well, it is now, but ifwe're going to keep on doing this, we're gonna have to fiind someplace else to practice."
Did you always want to be a doctor ?
Who said I wanna be a doctor ?
Chenille.
Everybody.
Segovia?
"Yes, to the jail."
The jail?
Yes.
I need to see Benigno Martin urgently.
I know it's irregular but it's a matter of life or death.
The Director is waiting for you in his office.
For me?
Where's his office?
The officer will accompany you.
This way.
On the right.
"Empty your pockets, please."
"Hey, wait, don't run!"
Wait.
It's there.
At the end.
Good morning.
I'm Marco Zuloaga.
Benigno Martin left this letter for you.
"Dear Marco,"
It's still raining.
I think it's a good omen.
When Alicia had her accident it was raining.
I'm writing minutes before I escape.
I hope that all I've taken is enough to put me in a coma and reunite me with her.
You're my only friend.
I'm leaving you the house
I prepared for Alicia and me.
"Wherever they take me, come and see me, and talk to me."
"Tell me everything, don't be so secretive."
"Farewell, my friend."
It's the station.
Excuse me.
Wesley.
- Prentice here.
- And Hull.
- Yeah?
- We found the body.
Can you be more specific?
Sid Thomas-Haye.
Guy who escaped from the hospital.
"Found him in a Yukon XL, single shot to the head."
"Okay, nice work."
"Not so nice for him, but could be good for you."
We found his phone.
"A burner cell... clean, except for one missed call, so we ran that number."
Name came up as part of the Harris investigation.
What's the name?
Morgan Lewis.
Got any ideas why this Sid guy and Morgan might be connected?
Sid had a charge for possession.
Maybe he was Morgan's dealer.
We got probable cause.
"Morgan, you home?"
Morgan?
"Frank, I got something."
Yeah?
What do you got?
Car service receipt.
Looks like Morgan took a cab to the Larimar Hotel last night.
Maybe he got drugs and a hooker.
One last hurrah.
I know that look.
Okay.
Thanks very much for calling us.
Yeah.
Appreciate it.
- Hi.
- Hi.
( Clearing Throat )
Mikey Trenton and Ben Owens won't be in class today.
There was an accident at Ben's house.
Is Ben all right?
"Ben's all right,"
- but his sister's boyfriend is dead.
- What happended?
Some bizarre accident.
He was electrocuted in the jacuzzi.
I've been doing research into Mikey Trenton's background.
I really need to talk to you about this.
"Yeah, okay."
You go to your class.
I'll meet up with you later.
Okay.
"Eva, I'm gonna come back after my next class to check on that fax."
"""Electric chair""?"
We were so stupid.
"Putting the radio so close to the edge, that was so stupid."
He was probably just changing the station or something.
I went in to answer the goddamned phone.
Do you believe there was some pervert on the line?
I'm glad you're not dead.
God!
I wish I was.
Maybe it wasn't an accident.
"Nadine, I'm sure you recognize Acacio... and this is Gordo, his manager."
Gordo is more than my agent.
He's my buddy.
"In English, please."
- Sorry.
- Hi.
How's it going?
Acacio's going to play in England.
I know.
I saw it on TV.
Speculation.
Nothing's signed yet.
- Twelve million is cheap.
- You're crazy!
Acacio was the top goal scorer in the last two Rio championships.
"If I were him, I'd only sign for 1 5."
Acacio was the top goal scorer in the last two Rio championships.
She's right.
Twelve million is too little.
Acacio is a great player.
"Thanks, but I don't need anyone to defend me."
You watch and see if he's not the best.
Senor Juan.
That's me.
Can we talk for a moment?
"Of course, Mr. Vermont."
Have you finished the American contract?
Not yet.
It's almost ready.
"You know, Americans are sticklers for details."
I come from three generations of tailors.
- Details are my specialty.
What's yourshow tonight?
"Here, this is formaking a Zenne out of me."
You're a natural.
"Take this, idiot."
Go to my apartment and take whatever you want.
I don't need yourfilthy stuff.
Ah OKthen...
Don't you everwear colorless clothes again.
I don't want to see you in white ever again.
I'll miss you too.
Answerthe phone.
Please.
You sneaky little cunt.
"You faggot's daughter, you!"
My brotheris saving himself from you.
Your God left you a cripple.
You're gonna die here all alone.
Dad.
"One, two, three, four..."
"Five, six, seven, eight."
"Ahmet, raise yourarms."
Ahmet?
"Follow him, son."
"Ahmet, raise yourarms..."
"Four, five, six, seven, eight."
And we neverforget to smile.
Abig round of applause.
"That's one, two, three solid leads."
Three.
We'd need 30 private contracts to make up the kind of revenue we're out.
"Hey, we're doing our best here."
Just hold your horses.
POLICE RADIO:
Something came in for you at 3813 Hanover Lane.
You're to proceed...
Hanover?
That's where I just was.
What the hell is this?
A damn merry-go-round?
[Tires squeal]
[Siren wailing]
[Tires screeching]
"No, this is Burris."
Let me have Detective Donaldson.
"Richard, we got a problem over here at Audrey Matthew's."
"Uh, you better get the boys from the coroners."
"Yeah, that's right."
I don't know yet.
We haven't had a chance to talk.
"Just get on over here, huh."
[Siren wailing]
"Well, girl, what happened?"
Who is she?
Electrocuted.
She was electrocuted in the bathtub.
I know.
I saw.
But how did the curling iron fall into the tub?
There's no shelf or anything above the tub.
It's funny.
"When I saw her, I thought she was healthy."
Saw who?
Who was in there?
- You haven't invited alfred?
- I'm afraid so.
Do you think it'II be a disaster?
Why do you laugh?
This will be judgement day for George.
She should pay for her sins like any other fallen woman.
She can't avoid everything by being a man.
That's not alfred at all.
This gets better and better.
- Who is it?
- FeIicien MaIIefiIIe.
- He's the children's tutor.
- He can discipline those two savages!
"I wonder where I shall put him, though."
"In George's room, of course."
That's what he's accustomed to.
No!
He is a handsome brute!
How does she merit all these men?
(Marie) He looks angry.
I don't think he appreciated being left behind at Nohant.
- George!
- George!
I'II give you a horse to ride back to the inn.
- There's something I must confess.
- Drat!
We've been seen!
Shit!
(MaIIefiiIIe) George!
"Not that one, monsieur!"
He's a devil!
By God!
Higaki!
Careful not to get hurt.
The match will start in a short while.
We are currently preparing the court lightings.
"Everyone, please be patient."

- Love
You still don't know how I play?
Stand up!
Is he trying to break his leg?
Ku'so.
Echizen.
Echizen!
Fight!
Oi!
You guys are noisy.
You alright?
Show some respect!
Oi!
Shut up!
Let's go.
What is it?
Don't be too bothered about what the doctor said.
Don't force yourself to talk.
"Those words will come naturally, okay."
Our dead parents will want that.
If it's about money you don't have to worry.
Ku'so!
There are many better players in the country.
Try playing with them.
Experience it yourself.
You'll... be the pillar of Seigaku.
"Oh, thank you, dear."
"Yes, I'll be right over."
Of course.
Goodbye.
What did you find out?
Cause of death?
Drowning.
Her lungs contained water.
But it's hard to tell.
"Cardiac risk occurred about the same time,"
Caused by electrocution.
Signs of struggle?
None.
"She was burned somewhat, but that's"
Consistent with electrocution.
Was it an accident?
"Well, I don't know yet."
"Just, uh, let me know if you find anything, Doc."
Anything at all.
"Well, there was something else."
Maybe not much.
There were a couple of hair in her hand.
Looked like animal hair.
Get those to the lab.
"And, Cliff, I want that report fast."
I'll do my best.
Thanks.
"Come on, Greta."
[Door creaks]
[Ominous voices echoing]
[Pet squeaking]
[Owl hooting]
I just want to see what's going on with him.
You catch a vibe?
I've seen him at two different fire scenes.
"Chief, if we got a firebug here, you know it's next to impossible to prove anything."
Can you just spend some time with him?
See what we find out.
"Yo, Ernie."
Don't let Mills here make you do all the work.
He's what we call a candidate.
You know how there's all those rungs on the ladder?
He's the bottom one.
- Oh.
"- Come on, I'll give you a tour."
"Hey, heads up."
"Hey, what are you doing here on Thanksgiving?"
Reinforcements.
"[Alarm beeps, buzzes] Truck 81, ambulance 61."
Multiple gunshot wounds.
1542 Elmwood Park.
"Hey, would you put the turkey in?"
- Sure.
- Thank you.
This meal is very important.
"- Kid, you should stay--"
- Forget that.
Come on.
- Chief.
"- Yeah, I got him."
"Ernie, stand here."
"Let's go, let's go!"
[Engine starts]
[Engine starts]
There are no other customers.
Why do they keep adding up bills and cooking noodles?
Why would a small shop like this hire so many workers?
"White Tiger, there are 17 criminal cases against you."
"Even if you're in GuangZhou, we still have to arrest you."
"Bounty hunters from both sides of the rivers, ZheJiang, SanXi, GanSu and Hubei, all join forces to capture us."
You want us to turn ourselves in without a fight?
Come and get me.
Watch out!
Think you can get us?
Fat chance!
Husband!
Husband... run.
Boss Wong!
Boss Wong!
- What?
- I'm here to collect the laundry money.
Come and get it.
I just sent him away.
He's such a coward.
Lucky I've not been bitten by that dog with rabies!
Big Mouth.
- Big Mouth.
"- Yes, Boss?"
What can I do for you?
Get Ah Seng to dress me.
Big Mouth.
Still memorizing your script?
Where were you last night?
What's with the make-up?
Hurry up!
Don't take advantage of my good nature!
No cameras.
It's the perfect spot.
"See if you can track down Lily-Anne Lau, his daughter and heir. (WHISTLES)"
"Harry, wait."
I need more.
I just crossed a pretty scary line for you.
You owe me a proper explanation.
I owed Freddie Lau money.
Gambling debts from his casino.
But this has got nothing to do with me.
"I don't care how you get your kicks, Harry."
"But if I'm going to have your back,"
I need to know it's coming from the right place.
(BUZZER)
It's Harry.
(BUZZER)
"- Hello, Josie, is he in?"
- Mmm.
Harry's here.
JOSIE:
Napoleonic.
Used by a marshal in the 1806 war against Prussia.
Me and your brother fired them on the heath last night.
Half-brother.
Is this official or unofficial?
You better come in.
70 grand.
I need you to um... look after it for a while.
"Who does it belong to, Harry?"
- It was in transition.
- From you to...
A man who died this morning.
"You could use your influence, I'm sure."
"And of course, you'd know your secret would be safe with me..."
Servalan.
I'm sure it would.
But I don't submit to blackmail.
There's always a first time.
And it's better than being executed.
"After all, how many people have you killed to conceal your secret?"
You mean now?
Twenty-six... so far.
"You can't afford not to believe me, Avon."
- How the hell did she get off the Liberator?
- I don't know.
"Look, we both saw her."
It was Servalan.
You're just running away from the truth.
"All right, I believe you."
I didn't want her to die like that anyway.
I need... to kill her myself.
- Yablonski.
- Ho.
Hutchinson.
"Hey, Hutch, this is your lucky day."
They finally forwarded this from your old unit.
- I'd glad I got it before I go home.
- Horner.
"Klinger, Maxie."
Mulcahy.
Maxie?
Maxie.
Maxie.
Leave now!
Now what?
Why don't you answer your phone?
Answerthe damn phone!
The papers are not interested in warphotos anymore.
I'll see what I can do.
Do something on kids.
Kids always sell.
People want to see hope.
"OK, I'll ask the fixer."
Send me something in two days.
"Why are you so late, my son?"
School ends around this time.
"It's been half an hour, my eyes were glued to the clock."
What's half an hour in Istanbul?
What's this radio station again?
Radio 'Holy Water'.
I am scared.
Istanbul is a dangerous place.
I know...
You called me 26 times today!
I can't wait to see you get out of this filthy place.
"As if ourhometown were cleaner, look!"
Neverdeny yourroots.
I wish I could.
May God forgive us.
You're beyond mercy...
Allah has struck you already.
"Allah be praised, I'm fine."
Sure.
"Get up girl, put this away... wash your hands... heat some rice for yourbrother."
What's going on?
(DOOR SLAMS)
Wow.
"Damn, Finn."
This must be your best one yet.
How long you been workin' on this?
"Like two, three weeks?"
Fuck off.
I don't go to the bar and complain when it takes you 10 minutes to make a martini.
(PHONE RINGS)
I'm perfectly happy with where I'm at.
I just hit a little creative block.
That's all.
(BEEPS) Hello?
"Oh, hi, Mrs. Anderson."
"Why, yes."
The building manager's right here.
"Oh, I'm sure he'd be delighted to come over and fix your toilet."
He's givin' me the thumbs up right now.
He'll be over in a second.
"(BEEPS) You were saying something, right?"
About you being perfectly happy with where you're at in life?
Hello.
(CLEARS THROAT)
"Well, he said he was thinking of going to art school."
"And I said, ""Oh, what a coincidence!"
"Our building manager used to be a painter."""
(CHUCKLES)
"When you're 18, everybody wants to be an artist."
- Shh!
- FINN:
Where did you get that?
Garage sale.
(SYLVIE GASPING)
Athos!
Let me help you.
Where is Grimaud?
Dead.
I shot him.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Show me.
He was there.
I shot him.
He fell right there.
The others are in grave danger.
GUARD:
The Governor is here to see you.
I'm not receiving visitors.
You have not heard what I have come to say.
"When this is over, Philippe, and justice has been served, you'll pay for how I have been treated!"
"I am a son of France, a prince of the blood."
And yet you lock me up here like an animal!
(CHOKING)
(FERON BREATHING HEAVILY)
"It doesn't get any easier, this killing."
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
You better swap clothes with him.
(GROANS)
Hurry.
We don't have much time.
GASTON:
I take it the King doesn't know about this?
No.
You really think it's necessary to go after them?
"If it's the slightest chance they are walking into a trap, yes."
I mean which is understandable under the circumstances.
What about the other girls?
I guess it slipped their mind.
Jill's all wrapped up in her wedding.
"And you know, Becca just got that huge movie, so... it's ok."
"Happy birthday, Dale."
Hi.
I have a reservation under um Squire or Hallie.
Thanks.
Surprise!
You didn't think we were gonna forget did you?
I kind of did.
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!
"All right, guys."
Let's dance!
Whoo!
"Make a wish, but don't tell anyone or it won't come true."
Ok.
What could I possibly wish for?
Ok.
Whoo!
Happy birthday.
"Thanks, you guys."
"You're drunk, Jill."
You never cared before when I was drunk.
And it's Dale's birthday for Christ's sakes.
"All right, you have got to lower your voice now."
Because now you're making a scene.
"You bet your last, Drew."
Because it's nothing they've never heard before.
"You are so... self centered, Drew."
How's his health?
He must be all right.
He's still running around digging up tombs.
Mm.
"-Besides, he's had experience."
-I didn't know that.
"Ten, 12 years ago, I think, in Africa."
The exorcism supposedly lasted months.
I heard it damn near killed him.
Father?
-You're Mrs. MacNeil?
-Yes.
I'm Father Merrin.
-Come in.
-Thank you.
-Is Father Karras here?
-Yes.
-He's here already.
-Father?
-Father Karras.
"-It's an honor to meet you, Father."
-Are you very tired?
-No.
"I'd like you to go quickly across to the Residence, Damien and gather up a cassock for myself two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water and, um your copy of The Roman Ritual."
The large one.
I believe we should begin.
Do you want to hear the background of the case first?
Why?
This is yours to do with as you please.
"You can choose to escape, if you want, but you may never be able to return."
Don't let anyone decide for you.
"Hail Mary, full of grace...."
Does Otto know about this?
The deed's in my name.
"After the stroke, we transferred it all to me."
"Audrey, this sale's a mistake."
The market's shit right now.
It's better to ride it out.
I need the money now.
- Because of the investment.
- Yes.
"I need everything I gave to Victoria, and I can't tell you why."
"Well, I'm your attorney."
I'm exactly who you do tell.
What if I loan you the money?
- In cash?
- Yeah.
Now?
[chuckle]
How could you possibly...
"A while back, I put some money into a dance club in Hartford."
"A couple days ago, the other investors bought me out in cash."
- [phone rings]
- Uh...
Bernhardt Bail Bonds.
This is Audrey.
Tell him it's Otto.
You need privacy.
"Oh, Hi, hon."
"Uh, could you hold on a sec?"
"Um, it's Otto."
Would you mind stepping out a moment while I lie to my husband?
"Thank you, Lance."
Porter said Lance pulled you into a sidebar.
- You're so easy.
- Shh...
I've got another announcement.
I've got a placement with Grolier  Gaunt.
"Hey, well done, dude."
"Six months in Edinburgh, starting in September."
Edinburgh.
It's the top six practice.
"Oil rights, shipping, all the high-powered clients."
"It's in Scotland, Paul."
"Smile, everyone!"
"It's not ideal, obviously, but..."
It's only a train ride away.
At least not America or something.
- You could have spoken to me first.
- Yeah.
"Uh, no, I just found out this afternoon."
"But look, look, look, you're right, I should have got you alone."
"- What's up, guy?"
- Cue the lap dog.
"Ah, Lukesta, what's up bro?"
So...
- What've you got for us?
- I've got all sorts.
How's about a drop of the white stuff to kick us off?
"- Paul first, definitely."
"- Oh, no, I shouldn't do it."
"- Well, that's the whole point, mate."
- Yes.
- Go on.
- Okay.
- Been a good night?
We didn't even get the Joni Mitchell.
"Oh, don't, yeah."
Food and Drink.
"Food and Drink, OK."
I can tell you you will be looking for cocktails.
You have ten seconds to confer.
OK!
Single word ones.
Single ones...
"Mojito, screwdriver..."
Erm...
Time's up.
I didn't hear a lot of cocktails there.
Are you not big cocktail drinkers?
They are.
These two love them!
But we like two-word cocktails!
That's a bit inconvenient then.
Yeah!
"Simon, in the middle, we're going to start with you."
"You have 45 seconds, remember those passes."
You're looking for cocktails.
Reveal the hive.
Mojito.
"Mojito, correct."
Helen.
Screwdriver.
BUZZER
"Oh, you are locked out of the hive!"
"With 32 seconds left to go, and two passes to go!"
"You wanted to get screwdriver there, but you can't quite get it, because there's no R. Bad luck."
You've got one point for mojito.
- You think he's been acting a part?
- No.
He loves her.
I am sure.
- Of course!
Has he left her any assurance of his return?
Ask if he proposed.
No!
I cannot force a confidence from Marianne.
Neither should you.
We must trust her to confide in us in her own time.
There was something underhand in his manner.
You will think the worst of him.
I give him the benefit of my good opinion.
He deserves no less.
I am very fond of Willoughby.
"I get next game, okay?"
-Coming through.
Coming through.
"-Doctor, is he dead?"
"-Please, get out of the way."
-Dr.
Greene...
... canyouconfirm or deny this report?
Get Security to get these people into the Press Room.
Do you question Dr. Ross' decision to fly the child here?
-Not for a second.
-Come on!
"Move, now!"
Let's go!
Hurry!
We're ready.
- Good day.
"- Uh, no, I meant the young girl."
There.
- This is our niece.
She is lodging with us while my cousin's family is away overseas.
- I remember you from my first visit here.
Do you know my sister Isabel?
- She's a shy girl.
- She's very shy.
Very shy.
- Are you okay?
- I'll be there.
Go on.
"Well, it's so good to see you, Roderick."
"Best to the sister, yeah?"
Be well.
"You know, Isabel,"
I'm working on something very exciting.
I'd like to invite you to my lab to see it.
"Dr. Cairn says that your progression has been remarkable, so not to worry."
- I know my brother won't be pleased.
- You're a strong girl.
You don't need his approval.
You understand?
- Yes.
- Mr. Porter.
- Roderick.
"- Isabel, what are you wearing?"
Huh?
"Your fingers, they're filthy."
- I know.
- Who did this to you?
Motherfucking mutt!
You fucking piece of shit!
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Come on, come on!"
He bought his fucking button!
That fake old tough guy!
You bought your fucking button!
-Don't get nervous.
-You motherfucker!
Keep that motherfucker here!
Keep him here!
Keep him here!
"Come on, you fuckin' feel strong?"
I'm sorry.
Tommy gets a little loaded.
He doesn't mean any disrespect.
"He don't mean any disrespect, Henry?"
Are you nuts?
Teach this kid a little fuckin' manners!
"Hey Jimmy, what's right is right."
-You understand what I'm talkin' about?
-lt's alright.
"The kids over here, we're hugging and kissing over here and then 2 minutes later he's acting like a fucking jerk."
"No, no, no, nah."
You insulted him a little bit.
You got a little out of order yourself.
-l didn't.
-You insulted him a little.
-l didn't insult nobody.
Give us a drink.
-Okay.
"Come on, let's have some drinks, alright?"
"- Total shock, which I love."
"- I'm like, ""Wait."
"What?"""
- What's happening?
- Wait a minute.
What?
"- ""Why are you grabbing on me?"" - ""What's going on?"""
There was previously a scene there with Mike and a transvestite.
- You can catch that on the DVD too.
"- Oh, yeah, I forgot about that."
- In the deleted scenes.
- That's what I was recovering from.
"Are most of the scenes that are deleted on there, or did you pick and choose?"
We got a great scene with Kat and Jesus.
We've got Trannie Tris.
- Thank God.
- Trannie Tris.
- All the oldies but goodies are there.
- Do you say:
"- ""When I say 'Jesus' you say 'Christ""'?"
- That's in there.
Yes.
- That was fun.
- Yup.
Do you have the bathroom scene at the?
In the Catholic school.
Is that in there?
"- No, I'm afraid not."
- No.
"- That was kind of omitted, right?"
"- Oh, God."
- That was fun.
Who do you think you are?
- You can't treat those boys like animals.
- I'll treat them any way I like.
"- And if you don't like it, you can leave."
- I will.
"But I warn you if I can get to the authorities, you haven't heard the end."
"Miss Griffith, I demand your resignation immediately."
And you can have it.
- I've been waiting for that.
- Yeah.
Come in.
"- Hello, Miss Griffith."
"- Hello, Jimmy."
- Going somewhere?
- Yes.
Where you going?
I'm leaving.
You're kidding.
"No, I'm not."
First Patsy and then you.
"I'm not quitting you, Jimmy."
I've been fired.
Thompson fired me.
What?
Jimmy.
"Quite a delegation of our boys to see you, chief."
A delegation?
- What do they want?
"- I don't know, sir."
- How did they--?
- They got a hold of Walters.
He seemed a little scared and he told them they could see you.
"Shut, fucking you, right!"
She's just want to bring you up.
So easy!
I'll go to another announcement.
I got a placement to work and gone.
"Congratulations, dude."
6 months.
And I am to start in September.
And...?
"The fucking practice,"
"All do I ... shippings, all the high power plants,..."
Shipping costing world!
Smile everyone!
"It's not ideal, obviously, but..."
Are you to need a train right away?
It isn't America or something?
You're deciding too fast!
I just found out this afternoon.
Look!
"Look, look, look!"
"You're right, I shall discuss with them."
"What's up, guys!"
He's the laugh dog.
Luke!
"What's up, bro?"
So...
- What do you get for us?
- For Paul also...
"How about a drop of the white stuff, tickle soft?"
"Paul first, doen't he?"
I should not...
"- Almost for Paul, man."
Interesting.
No judgment here.
"- Sarge, I have to pee now too."
- Seriously?
"You, Diaz?"
"Look, I'll turn off at the next exit, okay?"
- I have to pee really badly.
- Hot.
- What?
- Hitchcock!
"- Guys, enough!"
- Sarge--
"- Yeah, I know!"
"You got to pee, I got it!"
"- No, brake lights!"
"- Oh, crap."
- Everyone hang on!
There's no side-impact airbags!
- Did you get breakfast?
"- I tried, but I got recognized."
- Do I know you from somewhere?
- Do you watch a lot of pornography?
'Cause I'm in most of it.
"- Oh, boy."
What if you were followed?
I don't think it's safe to stay here.
- Where are we gonna go?
- The cops?
- Or Figgis!
Do we have any weapons?
- I have the pipe we pulled out of me.
- I would sooner surrender than go anywhere near your gooey body pipe.
Look at me.
Ok?
Everything's gonna be fine.
"♪ ""Oh, Henry boy, the pipes, ♪ ♪ the pipes are calling"" ♪"
"You sweetheart half Mick, half Guinea?"
I'll sing with an Italian accent.

I could see for the first time that Jimmy was a nervous wreck.
His mind was going in eight different directions at once.
Think Morrie tells his wife everything?
Morrie?
Him?
That's when I knew Jimmy was going to whack Morrie.
That's how it happens.
That's how fast it takes for a guy to get whacked.
He's a nut job.
He talks to everybody.
He's always acting like a jerk.
Nobody listens to what he says.
"Nobody cares what he says, he talks so much."
Make sure you bring him here tonight.
-Okay?
-All right.
Start like this.
Sorry.
Did I get you in the eye?
"Stop breaking my balls, alright?"
.
I was just stalling for time.
That wasn`t funny!
A noise like that could impair the kids` hearing.
It was real!
"It looked real, didn`t it?"
I thought it was real gun.
Didn`t it look real when I fell down?
What?
Didn`t it look real?
What?
"Are you happy now, clark?"
She`s deaf.
What`s the difference?
It was fun anyway.
Let`s have a drink.
"Pardon me, sir?"
Catherine said we just stay on 50.
I was thinking of shooting over to 54 and zipping down to liberal.
What for?
The House of Mud.
What`s that?
The largest freestanding mud dwelling ever built!
"The pioneers didn`t have bricks, so they used mud."
"They didn`t use mud, they used sod!"
"Right, Audrey."
"When they ran out of sod, they used mud!"
Let`s skip The House of Mud.
Dodge City was enough for one day.
Catherine and Eddie are expecting us.
It`s living history.
"But, if you`d rather see your cousins it`s okay by me."
"personally, I`d rather see a pile of mud than Eddie."
Knock it off!
He's good luck.
Not that he remembered to thank you.
And Meadow loved that book.
"You know, I feel bad."
I didn't give you something.
"I bring something, but I forgot it when I left that morning."
"Balsamic vinegar, 35 years."
From my sister's husband's family.
Live in Modena.
"So, aside from your Dad..."
-was it wonderful being back in Italy?
"-It was wonderful, yeah."
"Go home and see your friends, your family."
I gotta be honest... it was not so nice.
-I don't belong there no more.
-No?
Something change.
-Maybe me.
-What do you mean?
I'm like a visitor in my own town.
Life went on without me.
There is nothing there for me now.
-No special someone?
-I feel strange to live here also.
Maybe I should never have come to America.
"You've made such a nice life for yourself, though."
You've got a wonderful home.
-A girlfriend.
-No.
"What do you mean, no?"
Jessica?
I try to talk to her... but there is no communication.
"Ifyou don't tell me whereJeffrey is, this is your funeral."
Throw this garbage away.
- Give me the money!
- Are you sure you still got bullets?
You wanna bet?
"Jeffrey said, always save one last slug."
"Either foryourself, oryour enemy."
Hurry!
Turn around!
Goddamn it!
Get him!
Promise me one thing:
"If I don't make it, take me to a hospital."
Have them save my corneas forJenny.
Ifthat's impossible... organize my money and send her abroad for surgery.
Don't think like that.
It's the first decent thing I've ever done.
Will you help me?
What's that noise?
"Who is it,Jeffrey?"
Sidney.
Here's your money.
I fought for it like a man.
This is my last tribute to a friend.
"Sidney, you didn't have to do this."
He said I was a dog.
Now I'm not sure if I'm human or a dog.
"Sidney, nobody can call you a dog."
Sidney!
Sidney!
Sidney!
Am I a dog?
I'll have to remember that.
Trevor?
Can I ask you something?
Should my lawyer be present?
Why are you always leaving me such generous tips?
- Do I?
- 20 dollars for coffee and pie?
And entertainment.
- Entertainment?
- You.
"Trevor, you don't have to buy my companionship."
"Sorry, I..."
It wasn't meant that way.
"If you really want to spoil me, take me to a movie sometime."
That's a deal.
"My goodness, there must be a hole in this glass."
I'll get it.
- You waited on me enough.
- Thanks.
It is the last door on the left.
Reznik.
I want you on the Swansea-lathe today.
Where is Sanchez?
"That's an irrelevant question, Reznik, I'm asking you."
Shit!
"- If there's anything else we can do for you, let us know."
"- Thank you, Mr Furman."
- Goodbye.
- See you now.
"Hey, look who it is."
"Bombay Miller, you okay?"
"- Good, good."
"Judy, honey, come on over here and untie Jack, and you get a great big banana."
Two bananas?
(CHATTERING)
"Ok, Judy, you win."
"Now, if you untie us, there'll be no punishment."
I promise.
(SQUEAKS)
"All right, Judy."
You've had your fun.
Now untie us before those soldiers get back.
(CHATTERING)
"Oh, now where's she going?"
She's making like an astro-chimp.
What else?
What else.
"Oh, here they come."
We couldn't find her.
Did she come back?
- Yes.
She came back.
- She went that-a-way.
"Oh, wise guy, huh?"
"Hey, fella, are you and American citizen?"
Of course I'm an American citizen.
"Well, I'm gonna see that your passport's revoked and that you're shipped back to the States."
"Captain, she really is our chimp."
"Look, I don't know what your game is."
Are you trying to get publicity for your compound?
Is that why you scared Sally away?
Forget about them.
How do we get Sally back?
It's very simple.
- l will take you to Bombay.
"- No, no!"
Brother...
"Unless I don't work hard, I won't get the fruits."
Fruits?
I can see the fruits that you've got.
And about that back-breaking drill that you spoke of what is that?
- That was about parades!
- l see...
So you call it parade.
And what do you do?
- Love!
- Love?
"That's only part-time, brother."
"Otherwise, she studies too!"
I can read you too!
Your height is 6 feet 2 inches.
Your chest is 42 inches.
You like light-brown clothes.
You have an import-export business.
And you don't know swimming...
"Enough of it, Pooja."
"No, Pooja...don't!"
"Brother, whose car is this?"
It cannot belong to you.
- lt belongs to a lovely friend.
- A lovely friend?
Or a girlfriend?
A lovely friend!
- You?
- l didn't see you here before.
I have opened this shop recently.
"Please, do not do it"
"What are you waiting for, Mike?"
Shoot him!
Shoot him!
You coward.
"Good job, Mike."
"Now, I've been national i.ne."
Are you to be lachrymose?

"Okay, guys."
Collect them all.
Statues take him from here.
Come on!
Let's go!

Would you listen to it again?

- I think it is not a sin.
Still using cooking as therapy?

Ooh.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
"Good morning, everyone."
"Oh, look at all of this food."
It's obscene.

"Please, everyone, relax."
What I need is

Has anybody heard from Chuck?
"Yeah, uh, he's-he's sorry he couldn't make it."
Charles has the right idea.
"If he were here, then I'd really worry."
"Anyway, one thing I'll say about William's treatment..."
Is that I have not lost my appetite.
I want waffles.
Music to my ears.
Dad.
What's he doing here?
I invited him.
Hmm.
"Looks great, Lil."
Really great.
So I hope you'll all join me
For this doctors without borders gala tomorrow at Columbia.

"Clearly, Columbia's run out of alumni to honor,"

I got the up.

You notice that bowling alley up the street?

She's watching her husband bowl.

"- Hey,did you see psycho there?"
"- Oh,yeah."

"Mint condition.You know,if you're ever interested."

What a sight you have so extreme.
I've never seen a noid with hair.

You had access to the equipment.

Monk?

There were two winners.
What happened to the other man?
The truck driver?
Eugene Maddox.
We've already talked to his lawyers.
He's agreed not to sue us in exchange for a rather generous settlement.
I'm sure he did.

Hell.

He wasn't afraid of the work.
He always trained harder than anyone else.
- He's a role model to young ones.
"He shows them that, you know, you get out of life whatever you put into it."
"- I mean, ten titles in a motocross class... that's crazy."
"- Every time he goes out there, he's thinking about nothing else but crossing that finish line first, and he does."

When was the last time you saw your roommate?
- Last night around 6:00.
- She didn't come home all night?
I don't know.
I slept at my boyfriend's.
Any idea where she might have gone?
There's two million single men in L.A. Take your pick.
"We found her car in the garage, but not her purse or keys."
Is there someone close?
Somewhere she might have walked to?
Wait a minute.
Is Kayla dead?
We have every reason to believe that she's still alive.
'Cause I don't wanna be a bitch... but our rent's due next week.
- Vic.
I got great news.
- What?
Just be glad you hired me and not the brain-dead idiot your wife did.
Jerk off privately.
What do you got?
"Corrine's P.I., they're making nonsecure calls from his cell phone."
I caught one.
Found where she's at.
- Beauty.
You got the address?
"- Yeah, sure."
"- Oh, geez."
- Corrine...
I'm here to kill you.
What did I do?
You want to keep my boss's land!
Brother...
"His Refugee, Will it be a hit or flop?"
"Tell her, Who's the king of Mumbai?"
Who?
Brother...
Apparently she's the king and the king Kong.
Poor Laxminarayan.
Badla Bhai told his mother.
What did he say?
Laxi's mother...
Steel from the gun and child from the womb.
They never go back.
But only mother knows her pain.
Right?
I thought he'll do few murders in his life.
I thought he'll get settled.
I wanted to you marry the daughter of Chota Khujli.
But came out useless.
Take your argument at home.
Bhai give me one chance.
No one gets two 4s at one ball and two chances in one life.
Stupid fool like you Laxminarayan is no one else in the world.
"Shoe is chewing me, then you chew it."
"This is Laxminarayan Two, MBA from Jharkan University."
He has just two rules in life.
"Rule no 1, Boss is always right."
"Rule no 2, If the boss is wrong then follow the rule no 1."
"Sofa or Chair, Sir?"
Chair.
5th Army Cameras!
Turn that... thing.
Oh my!
"General, there was a small accident but we'll go on."
Continue.
We better go now.
I'm sorry about that.
"I'm sorry, we better leave."
The ambulance is on its way.
"You can go, Jimmy."
You are the winners.
-What's the matter?
-A transfer instability.
It may be only temporary.
Something's wrong.
"Yes, you're right."
It's getting smaller.
-Can't you do something?
-I don't understand.
I don't understand.
But the Doctor's in there!
-It's your codes that are doing this.
-This is unheard of.
"-Well, how do we get him out of this?"
-A fault in the computation.
But there must be something you can do to put him right.
Take the machine to the Central Register.
What're you going to do with it?
"The Central Register, quickly."
There may still be time.
The honour of Logopolis is at stake.
I was thinking...
I only smoke when I'm with you... wonder why.
I can't thank you enough...
for the other day... for tonight.
You're such an inspiration.
The way you've changed.
"""Evolved"", I guess, is a..."
"better word, into this beautiful... smart... very sexy..."
I think I must have loved you all along...
I just... didn't know it.
What an idiot.
Ha...
"Hannah, this is... this is ridiculous."
"Gregory, I really can't talk now."
"She can't not talk to me forever, I..."
I've got...
"Gregory,whatareyou doing?"
There're certain things I have to explain to her.
"I think it's a little late for that, Gregory, don't you think?"
What!
?
"I said, ""I think it's a little late for that, Gregory""."
"No, I don't think so."
What Rose and I have goes far beyond what normal people...
What's all that noise?
"What are you trying to say, Gregory?"
"Gregory, what is going on?"
Could you just...
Gregory!
Hannah!
What!
?
Move it!
He's hypoxic.
"All right, let's move!"
- Clear the blades and we'll shock him.
- Where's the crash cart?
"- All right, the paddles."
- We just landed at County General.
- The doctors are taking out paddles.
- Charging!

Several doctors are trying desperately to revive Ben Larkin.
- One-fifty.

- So far their efforts are failing.
-0.4 epi.
- Charging 200.
- Clear.
- Will he make it?
- Shock him again!
One more time.
- Charging 200.
- Back.
- Let's get him inside.
We'll try it again.
- Are we gonna lose him?
- Got warming blankets?
- We're all set.
Damn.
"We'll shock him again, then we'll try rapid rewarming."
- Get that gurney out of there!
- That little girl?
Take look.
This uniform transforms a common man into a hero.
- I see.
This uniform can turn an out-of-form guy...
- into a macho-man.
- Idea.
What?
Idea.
Only you can save me from suspension now.
- What?
- You take my place.
Go posing as inspector Zoravar.
- Zoravar can...
- Hold on uncle.
This is impossible I cannot do it.
Why do you think the ACP chose me?
Because he knows it's just a formality.
And I assure you... she will believe you're Zoravar.
Because she has never seen me.
It's headfirst to Delhi.
It's just fo rthree days.
Here's her photograph.
What's the problem?
- Ankita!
- Yes she's...
You know her?
Yes I know her very well.
We met last year during the Jaipur lnter-college festival.
Her voice.
Her eyes.
That mind-blowing attitude.
Different.
"Hot, maybe?"
Very hot?
What is this?
This is water?
- It's a mousetrap.
"-Heh, and this?"
My grandmother's earmuffs.
"Heh, look at them, lieutenant."
Everybody is a clown.
How do you expect to win the war mit an army of clowns?
We sort of hope you'll laugh yourselves to death.
Yes.
"Now, outside, everybody!"
Everybody out for the blankets!
- Clear out.
Here we go.
"-Hey, you too!"
Outside!
Get going!
"Hurry up, boys."
"Oh, that Schulz pig."
He knew where the radio was all the time.
"Whoever that stoolie is, he's sure batting 1000."
Now the guy I want to talk to is Sefton.
Has anybody seen Sefton?
"Cookie, you haven't seen Sefton, have you?"
"No, I haven't."
"Krause, you here."
"Hoffy, I'm very sorry about the mousetrap but the war news are very depressing anyway, huh?"
I might as well also confiscate the antenna.
American know-how.
"All right, let's hear it."
"Lisa""s body fits perfectly next to my body when we sleep."
You hold her?
All night long.
"You never hold me like that, David."
Never.
"Right now, you""re old news."
"You""re the same face Pete""s woken up next to for 12 years."
"What""s wrong with my face?"
- Nothing.
"- Crow""s feet."
I had my eyes done when Jim went through his phase.
A little liposuction.
A little breast enlargement.
"You don""t want to pay less than $5,000, believe me, or you""ll look like it."
So I should mutilate my body to make my husband happy?
- No.
- Yes.
Women are stronger than men.
"You suck it up, Joan."
Do what you have to.
"You""re in a life-and-death fight for your family."
"You don""t have the luxury of pride."
This may come in handy.
Good luck.
"It""s the baton twirler."
"I can""t prove it yet, but your husband""s shacking up with the baton twirler."
"- It can""t be."
"She""s my friend."
"- I know, sweetie."
We met her and her husband.
- What is it?
- Danny and I... we met Shannon in Lamaze class.
- horrible!
Who's this?
"- My father, rest his soul."
They've done fireworks for generations.
Mattia does them too.
That's why the explosives...
He's tops.
And this is forthe curtains.
And I thought...
But I'm a little sorry that you're not sleeping at my house.
Who'II steal yourwaIIet now?
I don't know how to thank you.
- How much?
- What are you doin'?
- We did it in friendship.
- We don't even know each other!
We'II learn to.
I owe you one.
The curtains will come later.
There's the sea!
I hadn't realized.
"One of these evenings I'II invite you to dinner at the sea, to thank you."
"Okay, this evening."
- But you're our guest.
"- I can't, my back..."
"Why, you eat with yourback?"
"Whitebait omeIet, cianfotta, cecata soup and soppressata."
"Stuffed anchovies, fusiIIi with meat sauce and white CiIentan figs."
- What?
- You have to taste everything.
Why just taste?
Let's eat it all!
"I mean, what do we got ourselves?"
"A ""thinner"" sitch here?"
Slim Jim might not even know.
Hm.

Hi.
I believe you have something of mine.
Kill Wayne?
I loved him!
Dean:
So...you were...
Yes.
Okay?
"We were having an affair -- for years, actually."
"I don't mean to be rude, uh..."
But how is it that Wayne McNut is your type?
"I mean, you're married to a man who's barely a buck -- wet."
What can I say?
Sometimes it's nice to feel a little give.
Oh.
"Yeah, I get that -- a little extra cushion for the, uh..."
Help me understand something.
"If you loved Wayne, why did you put a curse on him?"
It wasn't a curse.
Putsi bags are also used for blessings.
I wanted Wayne to win.

"Plan was, take the prize money, get a quickie divorce, and then tie the knot in Orlando."

So the wedding is the 3th of the next month isn't it?

Tell her.
"Betty, the graduation dance is off."
She hung up.
What a fine graduation.
- I know someone you can take.
- Who?
Allison MacKenzie.
Her mother kicked me out of the house for kissing her.
I'll talk to her mother.
Allison's a girl of quality.
"Quality's a very good thing in woolen cloth, but it's very dull on a big date."
"I didn't know you were such a good dancer, Allison."
- Thank you.
"- Yeah, sure."
"- Hi, Rod."
"- Hi there, Allison."
"Hey, Rodney, looking for someone?"
"After the dance, shall we go to Rockland?"
Okay.
"Oh, really?"
"- Some more, Mrs. MacKenzie?"
"- No, thank you, Ms. Thornton."
"May I have this dance, Mrs. MacKenzie?"
"I haven't danced for such a long time, I'm afraid I'd be terrible."

"I saw the one where he plays, like, five different characters."
"Yeah, Black Cop/White Cop."

This is a good thing you've just done.
"Well, I hope so."

And you still have the messages from yesterday?
I need to know if he's getting these messages or not.
"Okay, well, look, if he calls in, just tell him again."

- Who are you calling?
"- Uh, Miles."
You've called 700 times since yesterday.

"They're dark, so we're afraid of them."

Okay.

What topic?
Your sexual orientation.
My sexual orientation?
"Yes, your sexuality."
If you like men or women.
"When you came to see me, you said you were still a virgin."
Well...
"To answer your question in some way,"
I think I'm oriented more towards men.
Was that why you came to see me?
I can't remember now.
I guess so.
But I'm fine now.
Do you have a partner?
More or less.

"A very strange girl, very sweet."
-Very....

No.
"No, no, no."
I'm no longer Abnegation.

"I mean, maybe."
"It's a question of semantics, I suppose, whether it's stealing or charity."

How much?
Nine hundred and eighty dollars.
Nine hundred and eighty dollars?
Yes.
"It's Ok, you know what we'll get the money."
"Love is alive, you act like a newborn child."
Love is war
Broken and running wild.
That's her.
I'm suddenly nervous.
You're going to be great.
I'm having the strangest craving for a corn dog.
There may be one left.
Seat?
How about that?
"Fourth quarter, Team Frank comes through in the clutch."
"Oh, yeah."
True love on Valentine's Day.
What more could you ask for?
Yeah...
"Hey, uh, so, you know, we reserved the limo for another two hours."
What do you say we drive down the beach?
"Uh, that sounds suspiciously like a Valentine's Day date to me."
"I don't know, that might make us break up."
What if I said I had newfound faith?
I would say I agree.
I have newfound faith.
I agree.
Okay.
"Onward, Jeeves."
"Yes, yes, yes, to the beach."
-=The Last Fantasy=- Proudly Presents
I'm pregnant.
What ?
Previously on The O.C.:
"Sandy, we're having a baby."
I just want you to find something that you really care about.
I could be a critic.
You mean spending your whole life watching movies and telling people how terrible they are ?
What are they doing out here?
"Well, patrolling?"
Who cares?
Maybe Matak has them looking for us...
CRAWFORD:
Christ knows I've paid him enough.
"Matak set you up before, remember."
And your men tried to kill him at the exchange.
Maybe he just wants to return the favor?
"I say we find a different route, just to be safe."
(YELLING IN ARABIC) What's he saying?
Janjaweed.
Two jeeps.
Coming fast.
"If we press on, we hit that checkpoint."
If the soldiers are friendly we'll have more fire power against the Janjaweed.
STONEBRIDGE:
"Crawford, you drive, take it slow, but get ready to gun it on command."
What's going on?
What are you doing?
"It's a checkpoint, get your head down, we might need to blast through."
No.
No more guns.
"Clare, just keep low."
Crawford.
Latif's spy.
What's his name?
"Oh, Clare's safe now, is she?"
What...
(GRUNTING) Jacoub.
(ENGINE STARTS) Stay down.
(YELLING IN ARABIC)
Allow me.
"Remember all those secrets Jenny amassed when she was trying to protect you, Nelly?"
"Well, now the world knows them too."
Looks like we have a winner.
Now if you don't mind...
PENELOPE:
How can you do this?
Letting some girl from Brooklyn carry on our legacy?
Ever heard of a foreign queen?
"Besides, her dad is marrying Lily Bass so I think that makes her richer than all of you."
Not enough.
JENNY:
"Okay, so starting next year, no more headbands, except for this one."
"- Thanks, you can keep the change."
"- Oh, big spender."
"Hey, Mom."
It's really cool here.
I've already met some great people.
Yeah.
"All right, all right, you were right about Portland."
I think I'm gonna love it.
All right.
"Listen, I gotta go, all right?"
I'll call you soon.
NATE:
"I'm done for the day, if you guys wanna see a movie."
Let's do it.
[PHONE RINGING]
Hold on.
Hold on.
Hello?
GEORGINA:
"- Hey, what's up?"
"- Oh, hey, come in."
This is Dr. Black.
Tracy and Jacob Myers.
They're very good friends.
- Hello.
Lovely to meet you.
- Hello.
Dr. Black is our star brainiac here at the Cube.
Oh.
"""May the source of strength who blessed the ones before us help us find the courage to make our lives a blessing."""
"So, Jacob's experienced a sudden spiritual conversion."
He's bonkers.
We've always been bad Jews.
I can count on one hand the times we've gone to temple.
All of a sudden...
I'm enlightened.
Beautiful office.
I think we need a full neurological work-up.
I'm happy to help.
Would you like to come to my office?
You can tell me all about it.
- Thank you.
Thank you so much.
- It's okay.
- Oh.
- What are you doing?
- The Myers are philanthropists...
- I'm just standing here.
- You're standing in the hallway.
"- And they've just recently joined the board at the Cube,"
- so make sure they get VIP treatment.
- When?
"When you do, that's why you never see me."
The forensic said it was a boat propeller.
Nobody in her family knew she was leaving town to work.
The girls had one just like it.
JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN
These places aren't on the map.
We don't know where they are.
- What's in it for me?
- What do you want?
What size are those?
Size big.
These places are hard to find.
Almost 500 pesetas.
- Five hundred.
- And the smokes.
For the ride.
"I told you, nobody lives there."
It's abandoned.
Want me to open it?
Looks like they left in a hurry.
They left when they found out their daughter had drowned.
They couldn't set foot in the house after that.
You know them?
"Beatriz, Estrella and Carmen."
Charlie's Angels.
The one in the middle is Quini.
- Hi.
- Hi.
His mother disappeared three years ago.
My husband gave her this cross.
She never took it off.
- And the plane wasn't even full.
- See?
How far will that get you?
You can't even take your mistress on a weekend trip.
Nothing.
"All right, fine."
"But tomorrow morning, these people are going to be in my office."
- What do you want me to tell them?
- Send them to me.
I'll explain everything.
"They'll understand, don't worry."
Anything else?
Your appointment is here.
Who is this guy?
Remind me.
Joseph Kay.
Heads up a department at St. Louis.
- I'm not sure what he wants.
- Heads up a department?
Something like that.
"""Something like that."""
"""I'm not sure what he wants."""
What's that supposed to mean?
Why send him to me?
- You were recommended.
- By who?
- Who upstairs?
- Ross.
I see.
- Your daughter called.
"- Oh, yeah?"
She left you messages at home and...
"-Oh shit, we gotta go."
-Wow!
The mother lode.
- I think you're right.
"No, wait, wait, wait."
Go back.
Jaelen.
Is this her?
-It is.
-Who is she?
- A young woman Jaelen had the good taste to fall in love with.
"- You do have a good taste, my friend."
-She's being held at the Dulce Base.
I'm quite sure her friends and family would be interested to know that.
- How soon would you be able to upload?
-Right now.
-Where are the files going into?
-To an old compadre of mine.
- They'll upload to sixty [ indistinct] globally.
The initial launch should reach about 6 million people.

And 106 .54 degrees west.
- Southwest corner of the Haines Canyon Reservoir.
-Remember.
Sun fall.
You'll give them the Purean.
"And Robert, you can go with them."
"- Like you, Jaelen, there are people that I can't leave behind."
Not with what's coming.
You folks will be seated right here in passenger car one with the big grapes.
And I'm gonna take these little raisins back to the end of the vine.
"- Bye, Mom."
- Bye!
Whoa!
It's the biggest chocolate fountain on a train in North and South America.
The world's biggest is in Guatemala.
I did not know chocolate came from fountains.
I want to put my head in it.
And my feet.
"Ethan, thank you very much for the guided tour."
"Uh, looks like we'll be setting up shop here for the day."
For your troubles.
"Uh-uh, no-no-no-no-no, no-no-no... no."
"Oh, here you go, one more for you."
"Uh, kids... no."
I'm sorry.
"Okay, one more for you."
Oh.
"Ye... actually, uh..."
"Thank you, Ethan."
if you could put that down.
"Kids aren't allowed anywhere near the buffet, or the passenger cars."
But you are absolutely welcome to...
the Juice Caboose!
"Ugh, what a dump."
"Hey, there's someone there."
Regular Sized Rudy?
"Louise, Gene, Tina..."
what are you doing here?
"Hold on, Beanbag, I'll be right back."
I know these guys from school.
We just got back from the Balkans.
What was the artifact you found?
A metal box.
An Ark.
The Ark of Solon?
Atticus thinks so.
But that's incredible.
The Ark of Solon is like the Loch Ness Monster of archaeology.
People think it's a legend.
Isn't it supposed to hold the Torch of Truth from Atlantis?
Don't know.
We haven't opened it yet.
This came off a scratch on the side.
"Can you analyze it for me, please?"
Sure.
I'll run some tests in the lab.
Thanks.
Would you like to carry my books?
"Yeah, sure."
What a madhouse.
How do you stand the noise?
This is the rush hour.
You should be here when it's really quiet.
It's enough to drive you batty.
Kelly!
I'm so sorry I missed your lecture.
It's impossible London traffic.
"Hello, Simon."
"Oh, do you remember--?"
MacGyver.
Professor Carson.
"You were at Thera with that buffoon, Atticus."
My father gave us that.
This is yours.
Remember this?
"Oh, no."
Can we just do this without any theatrics?
Please.
- We should have some kind of ceremony.
- What?
"You know, with the boys."
Some kind ofthing so they don't forget we were once-
What are you doing?
Richard?
Leave them alone.
- Do I look well to you guys?
- You should be in here packing.
"Objectively speaking, if you weren't my children... would you think, that guy looks okay?"
He looks like a guy who might have a wife and kids and stuff?
- Are you mad at us?
"- Yeah, totally."
I think you look good.
"Okay, good."
"Space, space, dash."
Is that a Bengal tiger?
I don't know.
"Space, space, space."
Dash.
"And in the dark of the night, and it does get dark... when I call a name-"
When I call a name.
It'll be your name.
What's your name?
Nevermind.
Let's go.
And you went to I.A.?
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you crazy?
Apparently.
I'll take the lead on this.
You jump in if you have a question.
Joe Penn?
Yeah.
We need to talk to you about the complaint you filed.
I already told you guys everything last night.
We're with Internal Affairs.
We conduct our own investigation.
I'm kinda busy.
You wanna retract your statement?
Then tell us what happened.
"I'm drinking a beer, talking to my buds."
"Out of nowhere, this dickmo flies--"
- Which dickmo would that be?
- The big ugly one.
Taggot?
He starts going off on Val.
- Who's Val?
- The bartender.
Taggot was drunk.
How do you know?
- You could tell.
- But how?
Were you sitting next to him?
"Did you buy his drinks, count how many he had?"
"Was he slurring his words, stumbling--"
Why would you assume officer Taggot was drunk?
'Cause Val was trying to cut him off.
Even afterworking hard all day..
"..even after starving, I collected only 900 rupees."
I cant understand what to do.
"Brother, this is Mumbai city."
"If you lose hope so soon, then.."
..you wont be able to do anything.
Then what else should I do?
"How can a man, who earns just 50 or 100 rupees.."
"..a day, pay back sirs Ioan worth lakhs of rupees?"
"If your intentions are good, then you can do anything."
No!
"To earn money, a man needs to be smart.."
..cunning and educated.
"And I am an illiterate, a duffer, foolish."
What can I do?
Everything will be alright.
God is there.
hell make everything alright.
Oh God!
Make me worth getting sirs old days back!
"65, 1, 1."
Take one..
-Action!
Yes.
I am a criminal.
And this dark world of crime..
Cut it.
- Im sorry.
"Make-up, come here."
Take two..
-Action!
Yes!
There's nothing edible in here.
"So, do you want..."
Where's Angela?
She left early.
"She must of had her reasons, or whatever."
"Well, do you want me to bring you to the hospital..."
- or do you just want to go to school?
"- Well, I... lt's whatever you want, sweetie."
Your mom says that it's up to you.
I guess...
I guess school.
"You rescheduled with Rosenfeld, right?"
And you've got the estimates?
Right?
I got them.
Yes.
Hey?
"Who's in there, what happened?"
Nothing happened.
I'm fine.
- Stop looking at me.
- Stop looking at me.
What are you doing here anyway?
- You are playing this all wrong.
- What are you talking about?
Please.
"Your dad's seriously sick, right?"
You shouldn't even be here.
"People are feeling sorry for you, right?"
- Use it.
Take advantage.
"- You're saying... I'm saying, you have a personal tragedy with a loved one."
I left my pancakes at the buffet.
"Well, have some of mine."
"Oh, thank..."
Mmm.
Thank you.
"Can I have a bite, Daddy?"
"Do you want some more, Princess?"
"- No, I'm good."
"- No, thank you."
Oh.
I think he was talking to me.
"Actually, he's called me Princess since I was a baby."
My dad called me Frizz.
"- Hey, Mom."
"- Hi, sweetie."
"Uh, can I go show my art project to Papa Jeff?"
"Ritchie, don't call him that."
It makes your mom feel preposterous.
"No, it doesn't."
I'm completely fine.
"Yes, Ritchie, go show your project to Pa..."
Papa Jeff.
"Okay, Ritchie, but we better stop by the nurse's office and have your hearing checked."
I think you got something in your ear... oh!
Awesome!
Did you...?
What is it about grandpas that they can always find change in kids' ears?
"I know you're really enjoying yourself, Richard, but I just want you to know, it doesn't bother me at all."
- It doesn't?
- No.
Not even a little bit?
I said it doesn't bother me.
"I know, but I""m scared."
"L""m so scared."
"Oh, sweetie."
"You know what, baby, you might just get it all."
You just might get it all.
"I love you, Mama."
"I love you so much, Cassie."
"Let""s get you dressed."
"""And they cheered and they cheered more and more."
"""They""d never seen anything like it before."
"""""My goodness, my gracious,"" they shouted."
"""""My word!"
"Lt""s something brand-new."
"""""Lt""s an elephant bird."""
"""And it should be, it should be..."
"""it should be like that, because Horton was faithful."
"""He sat and he sat."
"""He meant what he said and he said what he meant."
"""And they sent him home happy..."""
"""One hundred percent."""
"So, the sun was shining, the earth was turning... and my daughter walked into the rest of her life with open arms."
And it finally hit me:
Maybe Cassie has it right.
Wouldn't it be something if my daughter has it right?
"Bye, sweetie, we love you!"
"Bye-bye, darling."
Who are you?
Jesus.
You okay?
Do I look okay?
"If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist."
No!
No way a bit of weed is worth two years!
Mr St. Clair--
"Please, take a seat."
And let me finish.
If you own up to what you did.
Take some responsibility for your actions...
What's that mean?
If he pleads guilty to all charges--
I'm not guilty of anything!
Sentencing will likely be 3-6 months.
And there's a possibility of a suspended sentence.
Best case scenerio.
Right-- That's great--
"Oh, shut it!"
Why do you keep doing these things?
"Mr St. Clair, think of your future."

"But, Marva, your kids are Canadian."
"You have no income, no home for them."
You know these conditions must be met before I can release them out of the country.
They're my kids!
"Marva, we have no choice!"
No!
Gettin' tougher.
"Too many people like your cousin here, gettin' sent back."
"Look man, I ain't tryin' to come back."
"So, you intend to cease your criminal activities then?"

"Yo, what happened to fifteen?"
That was years ago!
"Now, homeland security, makin' tings a lot tougher for the little man."
"The normal rate is 30,000 US dollars."

"I told you stay off that shit, didn't I tell you?"

"Money got tight, alright--"

"Oh, my God."
Imagine.
NiaII would have to be the mysterious one.
I don't know.
I think if I wasn't in One Direction right now I would be working in a factory or being a fireman.
-That's quite funny.
-Yeah.
Why did you wanna be a fireman?
I don't know.
I liked the idea of saving someone.
What about the factory?
"well, that's just because me dad worked there."

I was a great baker.
Fish!
Yes!
-Yeah!
-bloody hell!
Fish!

When the Geneva man comes through the barracks I do not want you to complain to him because I have orders from the kommandant to report everyone who complains.
Look at him.
Dunbar's being crucified and he's trading again.
Didn't you get enough?
Oh no..
"Not all those, but say the name."

He licks the alphabet to fight the monotony.
"A, B, C..."
"Bon appetit, Frank."
- What is going on?
- It's these two studs' latest thing.
- You lick the alphabet?
It's...
- It's a bit gross.
- How unromantic.
You do that?
- Casper taught Frank to do it.
- I could've thought of it myself.
"- Look, buster!"
Don't discuss our sex life with him!
I didn't.
Then how does he know what you do?
- I don't know...
- I won't have it!
- Let me finish...
- No!
"You fuck retards and lick the alphabet, you jerk!"
"- Please don't move your leg, Casper."

-Weapons.
-Good.
Explosives.
We will fix it.
Here you are.
Writings from all Garnierovih hearing.
Copies of course.
How did you come to that?
"Maybe gonna sounded pretentious, but I think that the criminal zapisnièar Court weak to me."
-You bet!
"For each hearing There is evidence, the nature of cases, names of parties and attorneys, and here the opinion of the court after vijeæanja."
Excellent!
A country that is so held to archive is not completely lost.
Hello!
Remember me?
What do you want?
-Shut up!
-You are wrong!
I talked Jorkalom.
We know.
"He wanted us to send a message, So we will now and we send it."
What do you say?
Yeah fuck off.
Where are you taking me?
Shut up!
To find the man who ordered my father and little brother murdered.
I found him.
His name is Pham Son Ti.
And I will give him to you.
When?
"One week from tonight, at the old Costeau Plantation."
Colonel Cai knows where it is.
How much do you know about this girl?
Her father and General Ti's father grew up together.
Their families were very close.
Even before he moved to Hanoi he had more than a friendly interest in Lin.
Do you trust her?
Of course.
She's my brother's wife.
"Let's see, it's 0400."
That means we'll hit the drop zone around a little after sunrise.
Everything set?
Your gear's on board with Colonel Cai's.
KIRBY:
Thank you.
Let's get aboard.
MULDOON:
You heard the man.
Stick formation.
Let's go.
- Keep your head down.
- Don't worry.
"Colonel Cai, you haven't said a word all night."
You know why?
He's never jumped before.
First one's easy.
It's the second one that's hard to get them to make.
We'll crawl in.
It's probably time I was gettin' home.
"No, but it's still early."
"All right, then."
It's only a block away.
"Well, it feels like you're runnin' away."
No.
Just walkin'.
"'Night, John Sellers."
"Goodnight, Zelda Sayre."
♫♫
"It's the damnedest thing, Townsend."
"Zelda writes how much she misses me, and then she says that she's going off to Cotillion with Peyton, Patton, Perry..."
A girl has to keep her options open.
[scoffs]
What do you write back?
"Frankly, I think it's extremely inconsiderate of her to even expect me to."
"I mean, she's the one that's insisting that"
I rewrite my novel before she'll marry me.
Which you've done.
And I'm doing again.
"Once I get off to a good start, that is."
Hm.
I just need to show her that I can do it.
[clears throat]
"Hell, she knows I can."
I know I can.
But until then... why not send her a note?
"She's quite aware of how I feel, Townsend."
- In my experience...
- [chuckles]
Women like to be reminded.
It never occurred to me to get married.
You know I've never been in love in my life?
Is something wrong with me?
There must have been something wrong with your husband.
"Oh, he was alright."
I just didn't love him.
Love is a very unsatisfactory thing anyway.
Life is a regular battle.
There.
Chuck!
Chuck!
What's the matter?
"Chuck, he stole my money."
"Wait, I'll get him."
Chuck!
"Alright, get back."
Back on the curb.
"Watch out, let me through!"
Get out of my way!
Chuck!
Chuck!
"Oh, no..."
The man suddenly darted out in front of the truck.
I couldn't miss him.
Is he dead?
"Yes, well, I'm due at the hospital in the next thirty minutes."
"Yes, I've tried the drug out."
It's nothing short of miraculous.
You know they're going to announce it at the Medical Convention in Atlantic City.
"Oh, by the way, what's the stock selling at?"
Two dollars?
I think I'll have my broker tomorrow morning buy me about three hundred shares.
- Someone's desperate for a diet coke!
"- No, Simon's been attacked by a kid..."
Here?
"What did he do, headbutt him in the knee?"
No.
"Kicked him in the cock, actually, but listen..."
Please say you aren't asking me to protect you from children?
"Hmm, a bit."
"All right, Cholmondley-Warner?"
Is this your bird?
Nice to meet you.
You're just like Will said you was.
- Right.
I hope that's a compliment.
"- Oh, yeah it is."
"You wouldn't mind having a quick word with our boss Jim on the old blower, OK?"
- Please don't.
- New friend?
- From work experience.
A colleague.
- Jim for ya.
"Ignore everything he says, it's bollocks, I promise."
Hello.
Right.
"No, I'm not his girlfriend, no."
"No, we didn't have sex."
"He did, did he?"
"No, that didn't happen."
"No, I'm not a porn star."
"Charlotte, listen..."
I was working in a garage.
You don't understand what it's like.
"Now, who'd be stupid enough to break into an ogre's house?"
- Aah!
- Aah!
Booo!
"Oh, wow..."
Terrifying.
I don't know how I'm gonna sleep now.
"Happy Halloween, everyone."
"Oh, man."
You said this was gonna scare 'em!
Hey!
I worked hard on this costume!
Oops.
Heh heh!
"Admit it, Shrek."
Weren't you even a little bit scared?
"Donkey, ogres don't get scared."
We do the scaring.
And that's why we're the kings of Halloween.
I bet we can find something that will scare the pants off of you!
- Which would scare me.
"- Oh, really?"
And what do you have in mind?
All of us telling scary stories all night long.
There ain't no way you won't be scared!
Yes!
Stories to make your blood run cold!
- Yeah!
- Stories to terrify you.
- Yeah!
- And whoever shall last through the night shall be named the king of Halloween!
- I accept.
"Go, go, go!"
Everything ok in there?
I thought I heard something.
It's fine...
Dolores.
- How you've been?
- I thought I heard somethin'.
"You know, I did too."
Sound it's like coming from the upstairs again.
I was sure it was coming from here.
- Did you try next door?
- Are you sure everything's okay in there?
Yes.
"I really should go now, Dolores."
You take care.
- Well ain't...
- Dolores!
Dolores...
Take care.
- Couldn't get it right... go!
- Go!
"115th precinct, Officer Minocha speaking."
There's something wrong in the apartment down the hall from me.
"We're going to take care of him too, you know."
I know.
- I think we should do it now.
- Why?
He's sleeping...
it will be merciful.
"Oh I thought, we're out of bullets again."
"We are, but I can run out and go get some more somewhere real quick."
We couldn't even do it now even if we had the bullets.
It's like Jake with Chinatown.
Anybody named Beers would be sick to death of a joke like that.
That guy acted like he never heard it before.
"In strictly legal terms, Tony, someone having no sense of humor won't get you probable cause."
"Until we hear back from McGee, that's cause enough for me."
Mind if I get Abby in the loop?
Do it.
Beers.
Beers.
"Hey, Beers."
"Hey, come here, Beers."
Beers Palmer.
Huh?
That's different.
Do you want your kid to like you?
Anything on the air marshal?
Whoa.
You know about this guy?
"McGee's got the name, you got the picture-- what's the big secret?"
I think that Bishop and Tony didn't want you to know that they blew his cover.
And why did I just tell you that?
- And why do you know that?
"- Because he's very, very nosy."
"So far, no hits on facial recognition."
"Abby, hey..."
Whoa.
Boss.
McGee?
"He knows, Tim."
I talk too much.
That your guy's info?
Come here.
LEE:
"This is about the cartel case, I hope?"
Gotta go.
Bye.
Whoa.
I hope we didn't get her in trouble.
"Uh, not ""we,"" you."
It was just an e-mail.
"Anyway, it got us a lead, didn't it?"
"Yeah, and possibly Gregorio fired."
"I know how we all feel about Gregorio, but we gotta learn to work without her again, okay?"
Okay.
"Starting with figuring out how, exactly, Jared's connected to the bank robbery."
"Well, it may be what his father and girlfriend were hiding."
"I mean, Dana seemed really nervous."
Let's have another chat with them.
Only separately this time.
Looks like Sebastian's found something on the car.
I'll check it out.
Is he okay?
Don't know.
SEBASTIAN (grunts):
"Little help, please?"
"Ah, thank you."
"Man, I am sore."
"It's gotta be all that ab work I've been doing prepping for NCIS training, you know?"
Whoa.
"You care to turn that off, please?"
What?
"Oh, right."
Sorry.
So what about this beauty?
"Viljanen, goddammit."
Get up!
Show me...
A disgrace to the entire brigade.
Does he live here?
I'm too scared to sleep.
I can come and keep my finger in your navel.
Easy...
You're moving further down.
"Down, until I can feel your tongue... ah."
Don't turn it off or the neighbors will hear.
"No, I wasn't talking to you."
"He hung UP""-"
What happened to the smell?
-I threw Hakkarainen out.
Don't take any new idiots in.
-Of course not.
The red Batman has moved into building D.
"He's an old friend of mine, Jesse Viljanen."
He was just named firefighter of the year.
He was torching the garbage can!
"-He's a nice guy, really."
I think he's repulsive and nuts.
"What's eating you, Jemina?"
"Grow up, Mom."
Don't let your boy play with matches anymore!
Will you come and work at the office when you get better?
Are you sure?
Yes?
I see...
Goodbye.
You must not torch garbage cans.
Hallucination brought on by over-tiredness say what?
"Do not ""say what"" me."
I invented that.
Oh please that was so me.
Do you really want to have this argument?
No.
'Cause I know it was me.
Now my friends are not gonna hate me.
So just poof right back in my head where you belong.
They're gonna hate you they're gonna hate you.
-Oh real mature.
-Oh real mature.
[Both muttering]
[Mimicking Miley]
I cannot believe I'm having this argument with myself.
[Groans]
Let me ask you something son.
You ever thought about medical school?
Law school?
Any school?
[Clicks tongue]
Of course not.
Sorry I took so long.
Sometimes it takes a while to shake off Hannah.
It's cool.
No worries.
"Oh, I get it, I get it!"
Your stupid secret always comes first.
-What?
-I said no worries.
You ready to go?
"Yeah, right."
Shliemann!
Wake your men!
"Indy, the torches are burning out."
"Go on, get out of here."
Hyah!
Sallah!
Hello!
Hello!
"Why, Dr. Jones, whatever are you doing in such a nasty place?"
Why don't you come on down here!
I'll show you!
"Thank you, my friend, but I think we are all very comfortable up here."
"That's right, isn't it?"
"Yes, we are very comfortable up here."
"So, once again, Jones, what was briefly yours is now mine."
What a fitting end to your life's pursuits.
You're about to become a permanent addition to this archaeological find.
Who knows?
"In a thousand years, even you may be worth something."
Son of a bitch.
"I'm afraid we must be going now, Dr. Jones."
Our prize is awaited in Berlin.
But I do not wish to leave you down in that awful place all alone.
"Slimy pig, you let me go!"
Stop it!
Marion!
Hang on.
Don't...
-Indy!
-Don't fall!
"Marion, I got you!"
I got you!
Get the fuck out of my way!
- Ma'am!
Ma'am!
- Let's go.
Tom James!
Tom James!
Tom James!
Thank you.
"Okay, I admit, this isn't boring."
Why make the total of electoral votes an even number?
- Insanity?
"- Listen, I know this is a long night."
You're tired and you're cold and your legs ache and you need the bathroom.
"Boy, do you need the bathroom."
That fucking guy with his fucking charm and his fucking son and his fucking wheelchair with his spine all fucked up.
My grandmother survived the Dust Bowl.
"And before she died at the age of 89, she told me a secret that she kept for almost 50 years."
The story concerns...
"Ladies and gentlemen, Tom James."
How about it?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Wow.
Do I know how to pick 'em?
Yep.
"Well, thank you so much for being here."
I know it's been a wait.
And we really do appreciate your presence.
"What a night, right?"
It's the night of nights.
"Um, you know what I want to do?"
I can't see anything.
It must be catching.
Don't tell me you're going blind and all!
Sometimes if you bring your top down and waggle the bottom.
"Who do you think I am, Gypsy Rose Lee?"
Oh!
"Hey, it works."
"It's gone, Granville!"
"Oh, it's gone."
What a relief!
"Oh, that's wonderful."
"Now, what can we give this young man to show our appreciation?"
-
- Give?
-
- You don't have to give me anything.
-
- You'd do the same for me.
-
"- Too proud to accept charity, Granville."
"Well, put it this way."
What bargains can we put him onto to show our appreciation?
"Th--There we are, sir."
-
- Compliments of the management.
-
- You've been very good.
There's someone up there that sees everything we do.
"I know, I know."
It's that Mrs Harris -
- I saw her peering out of her bedroom window.
'Ey up.
"You just got out of juvee, and now you're talking about... going out there trying to start some more shit ?"
- [ Laughs ]
- That shit ain't funny.
"You act like you don't know who you are anymore, Derek."
And what's up out there for anybody who ain't you ?
"I'm still from this neighborhood, but you ?"
I guess that's what happens when a white girl goes to your head.
- Or gives you some.
"- Shut up, Lip."
Sorry.
I know what's out there.
"Ain't like you can't get past it, but you're too busy getting in your own way to see that."
"I had some help getting in my own way, didn't I ?"
[ Chattering ]
[Cheering]
"Hey, wassup ?"
What the hell was that ?
I was trying to block the ball.
Stupid bitch !
[Girls Yelling]
"Good going, Sara !"
Get off !
That's it !
"Nikki, back off !"
[ Chattering ]
"Oh, yeah !"
"Oh, yeah !"
"- Yeah, yeah !"
- l like that !
- [ indistinct Yelling ] - [Gunshots]
- [ indistinct Yelling ]
- What is this shit ?
It just seems surreal.
Like maybe we weren't meant to get to the normal part.
That's exactly why we're gonna do it.
"We're gonna go out, have some fun and try to remember that we don't have to be so serious."
"Listen, when I decided to stay here and to get to know you it was so that I could do things like this."
"I could bring my girlfriend flowers, take her out on a date try to be normal."
Have you ever even been on a double date before?
"Oh, absolutely."
"Uh, '72."
Hef and the twins.
- What?
- Yeah.
Playmates.
I got Miss June.
- Are you serious?
- Mm.
Miss Sommers?
Yes.
"Hi, Pearl."
Hi.
This is my daughter Annabelle.
"Of course, Jeremy's friend."
"- Nice to see you, Miss Sommers."
- Oh.
Jenna.
This property was in my brother-in-law's family for generations.
It's one of the original structures in Mystic Falls.
Used to be one of those old-fashioned drugstore thingies.
- An apothecary?
- Yeah.
You don't say.
Sorry if it's musty.
I traded him a Montagnard crossbow a number one address on Chu Do Street and a pair of Ho Chi Minh sandals.
And where did you get a pair of Ho Chi Minh sandals?
I made them.
I work hard.
I've gone to church.
I was a Boy Scout.
I was an Eagle Scout!
He's funny!
How did you get in here?
Where do you sleep?
Where's...?
Anywhere.
"All right, come here."
JAMISON:
Colonel Kirby?
KIRBY:
Affirmative!
"Lt. Jamison, 91 st Navy Seabee detachment out of Cho Min."
This is Captain MacDaniel.
"We'd have come sooner, but the Marines wanted a strip up north."
"It's going to get a little hairy around here, Lieutenant so we're glad to see you, late or not."
The rest of my outfit will be coming with the heavy equipment.
They set it down right where the work is.
"- How's that, sir?"
- Could you move that jungle back for us?
"Just say the word, and I'll move it to China."
We don't need that much.
Just a clear killing zone.
"- Will do, sir."
- Watson!
Arrange pads.
How many men?
- What are you doing?
- What?
"Well, the point of this was to show him how much you care about Stefan."
"You know, not to hopscotch down memory lane."
- I was just trying to make conversation.
- Try less.
Caroline.
Katherine.
"I'm sorry, you have the wrong person."
"Elena, come on."
My mistake.
- How's everything going?
- Matt's cheating.
"No need, I'm awesome."
Stefan Salvatore.
- Is everything okay?
- Everything's great.
So you haven't seen him before?
"No, there was nothing familiar about him at all."
Let's call it a night.
Send Matt and Caroline home?
"No, the whole point of tonight was to not have to deal with this stuff."
We need to get through one night.
One normal night.
You sure?
"No, I'm not sure."
But I don't know what else to do.
"Look, if there's another vampire in town, he'll still be here tomorrow."
We'll deal with it tomorrow.
Okay.
That's them.
Come here.
- Okay...
"Maggie, you're being ridiculous."
"Okay, there is a man's footprint, a formal wear shoe, look at that."
"- All right, Mags, it's just..."
- [screams]
- You're dead.

"Oh, my God, Mark!"

- My larynx.

I thought you were an intruder.
"Gingersnap, don't you ever apologize for your strength."
Got it.
Why were you in Emma's room wearing a tuxedo?
"Hey, man, I was just trying to sneak in and surprise my lady."
That's very romantic.
"Excuse me, I have to take a moment... [whispers] What's happening?"
'Cause that was beautiful.
"Hey, I have an idea."
Wanna play some games?
"One moment, Gingersnap."
I have to say something.
"Oh, Bruce, I have spent most of my life closed off to intimacy, protecting myself, but, since we've met, I've learned to open up and lay down my emotional weapons."
"I love you, babe."
I love you too.
You know what I love?
Games.
Both:
I can't rememberthe last time I walked on the beach.
"You're in Izmir, the beaches are only minutes away from here..."
How can I leave your brother on his own?
Let me go.
Let go.
I wish we were easier kids.
I wouldn't exchange either of you forthe entire world.
Let the world see what a true son is.
Mom...
Leave me.
Please excuse the drama.
Say hi to yourparents.
"Mom, come here."
"We leave and you stay here, OK?"
Promise to write!
Promise me.
"Call them to come back, right away."
"Kezban, what are you angry for?"
Aren't you the one who had Ahmet followed?
There is something fishy about the whole thing.
He said Ahmet is clean but I am sure he isn't...
Call the girl to come back.
There is no point keeping herthere.
Mom.
Someone's at the door!
Is Can Ozturk here?
Hold on.
You asshole.
Amoustache?
My lover likes it.
You ruined a good job for a fuck?
Something could have happened to you.
"I'm coming, Anna"
Brother!
Wake up
"I'm Nikki, not Anna"
"Get up now oh, what's the problem that you had to wake me so early!"
I'd be married if only you had waited
"Married, did you say!"
It's nothing... nothing at all.
What's the time anyway?
8 O' clock
If I'm late today too Imran'll give me hell...
And I must be at the station by 12 as well!
My goodness!
So many pictures of Anna!
She's in English literature.
In Economics...
In Psychology too!
I've only one favorite subject...
Anna...
Anna...
And Anna!
She doesn't love you though
"But she likes me, doesn't she?"
She'll love me too
I mean the way people talk.
"I mean, people think we did it."
I know.
It's like we might as well done it anyway at this point.
"I mean, you know, if everybody is talking about it already..."
maybe we...
"I mean, not to make a big deal of it or anything."
Out of what?
I think he was probably just thrown out of the building.
He's got a lovely face.
"Well, he's quite stout, which I actually like."
"Oh, his name's Mr Baker."
I don't know what his Christian name is.
She's gone.
She gave me her hand cream.
She loves you!
"""A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches."""
"Genesis, 32, verse 28."
His name is James.
I imagine you would remember him as Jimmy.
Jimmy?
Jimmy Baker?
Tubby Baker is Jimmy Baker!
Of course he's Jimmy Baker!
The one that jumped down from the the day of the you don't know where he went?

"Then I said, ""Catch him up"", so she's run out, looking for you."

"Oh, there was one piece of news..."
Mr Ferrars is married.
"Who told you that Mr Ferrars was married, Tom?"
"I seen Mr Ferrars myself, ma'am."
"This morning in Exeter, and his lady too, Miss Lucy Steele as was."
"Oh, Miss Lucy Steele?"
"Yes, ma'am."
They was at the door of the New London Inn.
"I took my hat off, and she knew me."
"Bade me give her best compliments, and Mr Ferrars' as well, to you all."
That is Lucy Steele.
- But did she tell you they were married?
"- Yes, ma'am."
I made free to wish her joy.
"Mr Ferrars was in the carriage, but he just looked out the other window."
- And well he might.
- They were going to her folk in Plymouth.
Miss Lucy seemed vastly pleased.
"Well, I..."
I'll put that lot away.
"Oh, poor Elinor."
"Oh, I cannot bear this."
"And I too, my child."
Through all her troubles I never thought of you once.
We all knew they were to be married.
Marianne had all my tenderness.
"I never thought once that you suffered as much, but unlike her were brave."
E-Excuse me.
I had better make sure that Colonel Brandon's room is ready.
"You know, ever since I was 16, I crushed exams."
I took on extracurriculars.
I showed up early.
I even sat up at the front and I stayed late.
"Man, I gave up everything."
"You know, I gave up fun."
I gave up sex.
I don't think you gave up sex.
- Okay.
Maybe not sex.
"- Yeah, you didn't give up sex."
"All right, all right."
"Not sex, but..."
It just annoys me that the one thing that is stopping me from going to Harvard Med is money.
"You know, tuition fees and living expenses alone cost over $300,000."
"$300,000."
It's outrageous.
It's astronomically high.
I get that.
"You know, I just thought there was more to life than just money."
"Well, look at the bright side,"
I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance.
Thank you.
"- Happy birthday, honey."
"- Thanks, Mom."
"Thank you, love."
Kisses.

It's front-loaded.

"Someone was snoring the day away, lazybones."
"Mom, today is a day that's been gifted to me by the universe."
Please don't ruin it by being you.
"You only have one more college essay left to write, and then you're done."
That has nothing to do with snow day.
Of course it does.
"You're physically trapped in the house with me, and all the roads and stores are closed."
Yay!

No!
Put away the word processor.

"Listen, kalaya's mother, she was a prostitute."
Your sister?
Yeah.
She has a bunch of kids.
She try to get them out of Thailand.
She doesn't care how it happen.
So she sells them to drug dealers.

He was out there the whole time.
"Well, even if it's true, I'm not gonna call his mother and accuse her only child of stealing from us."

After August 9... let's all go... to Hawaii with Aunty.
My uncle...
Right here?
And this is... the monument built for the children who died on that day.
With these children... my uncle died.
Just where did it happen?
That's something we just can't find.
You can't find?
That day... the whole town was in flames.
And this place was filled with people who came here to try and escape from it.
But the school had also been burned.
The people were burned.
"Iron, everything."
These people are the classmates of the children who died here.
These people...
"Somehow, they scare me."
It's because... those are the people who witnessed the worst fear.
"No man ever proposes unless he's pushed into it, isn't that right?"
It most certainly is.
And with that blond hussy chasing after Ed he's going to need a lot of help to shove him into proposing.
- That's what I keep telling her.
- Please.
"All right, but I know what I'm talking about."
You've got to make up Ed's mind for him just like I made up your father's.
Men being the simple-minded creatures they are.
There are the boys.

"Hi, Ed."
"Hi, Ruth."
"Hello, sweet."
How's everything?
Couldn't be better.
I got to talking and almost forgot supper.
"I'm glad you said ""almost"" because I'm hungry."
- And I'm a man that really gets hungry.
"- Oh, no."
"What you got there, margarine?"
"No, butter."
I borrowed it.
"Butter, huh?"
"Hey, what is this, Christmas or something?"
"Hello, Pop."
"- Hey, get a load of this."
"- Buddy, look at yourself."
- What's the matter?
I'm good.
All that wouldn't have happened if you didn't let her get under your skin.
You're right.
She's driving me crazy.
And I'm driving Anna-Kat crazy.
"Next thing you know, we've got a backpack full of cat heads."

It's just the size that it comes as.

Did you know the tsuba's now under Dickinson's control?
Did you know Bering and Lattimer had been detained?
They're at the hotel.
I'm taking you all off this case.
- Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Wh--what if I'm right?
What if it is Macpherson?
"Go home, Artie."
"- Artie, where are you?"
- It doesn't matter.
New orders.
You two stay in the hotel and you wait for me.
I will take it from here.
What's the matter?
The parking lot was empty.
More lights wouldn't have made a difference.
"Thank you, Officer."
That's very nice of you to say.
"Oh, I'm not an officer."
I work with Mr. Monk.
Is that Adrian Monk?
I've heard of him.
He's a genius.
Right?
And you're his partner.
Partnerlbabysitterlassistant lbabysitter.
What's your name?
Natalie Teeger.
"Miss Teeger, I know this probably sounds callous, but have you ever done any acting?"
Me?
No.
"Well, here's my problem."
"We've got another show tomorrow night and I know it's terrible timing, but we need someone to pick the numbers."
You mean on TV?
I think you're a natural.
"No, I don't think so."
Here you go.
I was just talking to his nephew on the phone.
He couldn't even believe it was really me.
I felt like Fats Domino.
"Mr. Monk, this is Mr. Lawrence."
He's the station manager.
Hi.
He just asked me to be the new lotto girl.
"Oh, only for one night."
We can hold a regular audition over the weekend.
- What's your name?
- Karen.
What?
"That's how you know a joke works, motherfucker."
"Oh, we're taking Karen."
"And, uh, we're leaving y'all with Nick Cannon."
So enjoy that shit.
I'm Jay Pharoah.
That's my time.
Thank y'all so much.

"You were expecting a package that day, some delivery?"
Not that I know of.
"Groceries, cleaning, uh, a package?"
I really wouldn't know.
"See, Karl takes care of all that."
I see.
Would you like to ask him?
"No, never mind, it's...."
It's very remote.
"No, never mind."
Yeah.
Would you like some more coffee?
Please.
That's cute.
"Your daughter, she's the artist?"
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
"Incidentally, um you might ask your daughter if she remembers seeing Mr. Dennings in her room that night."
"Look, he wouldn't have any reason in the world to go up to her room."
"Oh, I know, I realize but if certain British doctors never asked, ""What is this fungus?"" we wouldn't today have penicillin."
Correct?
"Well, when she's better, I'll ask her."
"-Yeah, couldn't hurt."
-Okay.
"Uh, in the meantime...."
That's okay.
"-I really hate to ask you this, but--"
-What?
"For my daughter, could you please give an autograph?"
Of course.
"Uh, where's a pencil?"
Right here.
I guess you could say I've had a romance with the West... since I was old enough to read.
- You miss that ocean?
- Sometimes.
"You know, I never learned how to ride."
Is that right?

"It's a nice afternoon, John."
I enjoyed my lobster.
"And I know Mr. Horn did, too."
I'm glad you liked it.
"- Excellent afternoon, John."
- Joe.

"The way I see this, you'll be a stock detective."
See that the rustling gets stopped.
You can stay here at the ranch... and I'll pay your wages as a cowhand.
$200 for every rustler that goes somewhere else... to ply his trade.
- Who do I report to?
- To me.
"And as far as you are concerned, you and Joe Belle never discussed this."
"And for that matter, neither have I."
Twenty-five.
Do I hear 25?
Would you bid 30?
Thank you.
Now a half.
Would you bid a half?
Would you bid 35?
40.
"Thank you, sir."
Now a half.
I didn't know.
Let's have a listen.
Could you take those downstairs for me?
And this trunk has to go.
(STARTS PLAYING)
"Franz, Chopin's going out."
We'll come with you so we can talk.
I'm going to meet Madame Sand.
- This is wonderful!
- You play it better than I.
You're going on a trip?
Franz!
Chopin is going to meet Madame Sand.
Franz thinks you're making a mistake.
He's in a position to caution you.
He once had his own experience with George.
"- Marie, I told you nothing happened."
- So you love to claim.
"You must listen to him, because, one way or another,"
Franz knows exactly who she is.
GEORGE:
I've always wanted to know.
"See here, darling."
Chopin has dedicated the Etudes to you.
To me?
It is a tremendous honour.
"What did you do to deserve it, I wonder?"
Marie is an angel of inspiration.
"It's good to see you, Franz."
You should come back to Paris more often.
We all get into such trouble when you're away.
Where are you taking him?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I have a restraining order!
"Trust me, I restrained myself."
"You can't tell Derek, okay?"
There's a lot more to this that you don't know about.
And just because you got the Alpha bite makeover doesn't give you a license to go around destroying people.
Why not?
That's all anybody ever used to do to me.
I used to have the worst crush in the world on you.
"Yeah, you, Stiles."
And you never once even noticed me.
Exactly how you're not noticing me right now.
Guys!
What the hell's going on?
Hey!
Enough!
Enough.
What do you idiots think you're doing?
Jackson!
Calm down!
"Mr. McCall, you wanna explain yourself?"
You dropped this.
You and you... actually... all of you...
Detention. 3:00.
"Hi, there."
"Oh, I'll make an announcement, have Scott brought to the office."
"Um, actually..."
I came here to talk to you.
Me?
Busy after school?
Always.
- Just runnin' around.
- Who sent you down here?
Don't talk back.
- What are you doin' here?
- We saw the car.
We was breaking down the tyres.
That's all it was.
Lock 'em up.
"Come on, come on!"
Nothin' but a bunch of lousy spic car thieves!
- Nothin' there except a New York City map.
- Are you bullshittin' me?
That car's dirty.
Take it in and tear it apart.
Tear it out.
"Nothin' here, Jimmy."
This is all solid.
There's nobody been under that car since it came from the factory.
That thing is clean.
"I don't buy that, Irv."
The stuff is in that car.
"Well, you find it."
I can't.
Enfiin on ne va pas passerlajournée ici.
Ça fait deuxheures qu'on estlá.
Soyez patient.
"Look, the car was lost sometime last night."
"First they send us to Pier One, then here."
Then what?
Why did you park the car down by the waterfront?
You're staying in midtown Manhattan and you lose the car by the Brooklyn Bridge?
Monsieur Devereaux is scouting locations for a film for French television.
-How you doing?
You all right?
"-Yeah, okay."
I....
I wanted to apologize.
"Oh, no, we finished with that sorry business already."
Sorry for getting you into this situation.
"No, you didn't get me into anything."
I got myself into whatever we got into.
-I was just curious about you.
"-And I, you."
You're the least likely person in the world for me.
-Are you insulting me now?
-No.
"No, not at all."
A compliment.
I think you helped me.
"Okay, a little positivity."
"Yeah, you helped open me up."
"Yeah, and I would've opened you up further if I had my way."
-That's disgusting.
"-No, not really."
It's honest.
-You should work on your manners.
-I know.
"I'm trying, believe me."
I wanna tell you something.
All right.
It doesn't matter who's right or wrong.
"I made mistakes, a lot of them, I know that."
I live with them every day.
The hardest thing I live with is knowing how much I've disappointed you.
Love you but I got to go.
I know pizza-boyfriend beats omelet-daddy every time.
Thank you.
Yes!

And it's a good message for the kids.

Twelve-hundred miles and you still look like you just drove off the lot.
How do you do it?
"Pretty much getting everything you want, aren't you?"
Yes I...
"-Pretty freaky, isn't it?"
I've been instructed not to sell you any more.
What?
!
You're demonstrating addictive behavior.
You seem like a nice person;
I hope you get help.
No!

"Hey, you guys want to make a quick buck?"
"Uh, is it gay stuff?"
Do you need it to be?
No.
Good.
I didn't want to have to make that decision.

CLERK:
"Sir, if you don't go away,"
I'll have to call the police.

I guess we'll never get to have ugly children together.
(grunts)
(maniacal laughter)
You checking me out?
"Well, too late."
You can't have none of this!
And I would've done anything.
Anything!
(maniacal laughter)
- [sighs] wayne.
you take care.
[engine turns over]
"- see, you could wear that to the sizzler or the prom."
that is gorgeous.
- it's growing on me.
- [sighs] okay.
- i wanted to thank you for what you did for tim.
"it pains to say this, but i've never seen him look happier."
- so is this some sort of an apology?
"- well, look, i'm sorry, too."
so...
"- uh, uh. baby steps."
- [chuckling] i agree.
[spits]
- [spits]
"- is everything okay, ladies?"
- yes.
- ah!
i knew it!
[all chuckling]
"- so, bob, i was thinking about a christmas gift for you."
"- oh, no."
this is all the gift i need.
"- since mama handed me this store, and she's your mama, too, why don't we become partners?"
- oh.
i-i don't think that would be such a good idea.
"- um... you know, it might not be a bad idea."
"look, there is -- there's a line outside the door."
"- but we can talk about that, but not today."
today is christmas.
"- well, merry christmas, you two."
Madame Sand!
"Oh, what a great honour you do my humble salon!"
"delighted to meet you, Baroness."
"I'm looking for my publisher, Monsieur BuIoz."
"He's in the salon with the others, but you'II have to wait to go in."
I've so longed to meet you!
I knew your father when he was young.
- really?
- Yes.
We girls were enraged when we heard he'd married that dancer.
- You mean my mother?
- Oh... of course.
- Is she still living?
- Yes.
- But she's ill now.
- How sad.
And what a tragedy your father died so young.
The Count de Saxe.
So dashing.
Those idiots!
Excuse me.
Not yet!
(Baroness mutters angrily)
(souIfuI piano passage)
Madame Sand!
Is it true that you're writing a memoir?
"- Do you pray, Baroness?"
"- If you must know, I'm secretly devout."
- Do you ever hear an answer?
- To my prayers?
"well, no."
There... is the answer.
"Morning, girls."
Someone had a late night.
What time did the cat drag you in?
I didn't exactly get dragged out.
"Molly, you didn't."
What can I say?
Jimmy is very persuasive.
And nimble.
"You got a guy, peggy?"
I'm afraid I'm married to my work at the moment.
What about mr.
Fancy?
"You know, the guy I've seen around the automat..."
"Nice suit, nice car, nice shoulders."
"Oh, no."
No.
He's just a colleague.
"Good day, ladies."
Early bird and all that.
"Ah, miss carter, please sit."
This will only be a moment.
"In 1925, the great harry houdini"
Performed at this very building.
"Ugh, houdini."
That's never good.
Women stood spellbound and watched
"As he escaped from handcuffs,"
"Straight jackets, steamer trunks."
But the one trick he could not pull off
Was ascending the stairs.
"It's a simple rule, ladies."
No men above the first floor.
"A pneumoencephalogram, I would think, to pin down that lesion."
It will involve another spinal.
"Oh, Christ!"
"Well, what we missed in the EEG and the arteriograms could conceivably turn up there."
At least it would eliminate certain other possibilities.
Dr. Taney says the x-rays are negative.
"In other words, normal."
You keep any drugs in your house?
"No, of course not."
Nothing like that.
Are you sure?
"Well, of course, I'm sure."
I'd tell you.
"Christ, I don't even smoke grass."
Are you planning to be home soon?
"I mean, uh, to L.A., I mean."
Um....
"No, I, uh--"
I'm building a new house.
My old one has been sold.
I don't know.
I was gonna take....
I was gonna take Regan to Europe for a while after she finished school.
Why do you ask?
I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.
Hello?
Sharon?
Shit.
God.
Sharon!
"What do you mean, leaving Regan by herself?"
Her window's wide open.
Whatever it takes.
Okay.
"Do the job, Emerson."
I don't wanna look like an ass for sticking my neck out on this one.
"'Cause I've got nothing left, nothing to keep you from the wolves."
0-7-3.
4-5-5.
8-1 -7.
6-9-0-1 -0.
Sorry.
Little last-minute broadcast come through.
I'll inform the authorities.
You do that.
- Wanna hear my latest theory?
- Sure.
We're coordinating troop movements in Afghanistan.
- Long-term tactical formations.
- Yeah.
"Illegal missions unsanctioned by the UN, that's why it's all hush-hush."
Could be.
"- It's good, right?"
- Yeah.
Maybe it's all just some sort of awful experiment.
"Stuff two people in a box, see how long it takes for one of us to kill the other."
- That's nice.
- Give me something.
We're up two hours early next shift.
- You guys been waiting long?
"- No, you're good."
- Good shift?
- Yeah.
Got to catch up on sitting alone for 70 hours.
How's your head?
It's fine.
I heard you stopped by Med the other day to see Anna.
She wouldn't see me.
No.
It was us that wouldn't let you see her.
"At the time, you represented hope for her, Kelly."
Did something happen?
"No, no, not that."
"But yes, something did."
"Her neutrophil count came up overnight, and we started her back on chemo this morning."
We want to take another shot at the bone marrow transplant.
"I mean, assuming we still have a donor."
Not even a question.
"Yeah, in 24 hours, we think she'll be strong enough to do it."
That's... that's great news.
"Truck 81, Engine 51."
"All right, buddy."
You go be a hero.
I'm gonna schedule your donation for tomorrow.
- All right.
- 7110 South St. Lawrence.
Help!
Please!
Maggie's trapped upstairs!
- Where?
- Up there!
"- Severide, Squad!"
- On it!
- Anybody else up there?
- No.
"Casey, vent the roof."
"A thousand greetings to you, Terry, Dad,"
"Furface and Watersprite, from your loving Henry."
The main thing is he's alive and well.
Where does it say greetings to Furface and Watersprite?
Here.
He never forgets us.
Give him our love too.
"Of course, and I'll say how you help me."
"Come, let's feed you."
You need a rest after your long flight.
"But I'm not alone, really."
The Duke sent Henry away to fight the Turk.
The Turk?
But nobody came back alive!
"That's what the Duke thinks, that ghastly ugly wretch."
Ghastly?
Ugly'?
The nastiest under the sun.
He's mean to everyone.
"But he'll meet a just end, such a type always does."
But they praise him in town!
Our Duke?
Must be some mistake.
"The Count in Netolice maybe, he's a wonderful person."
"But our Duke is proud and evil, just about ripe for hell."
- Stop it!
- Don't you like our food?
Honza's used to better things - on his travels.
Johann!
Not Honza!
How about a nice roast chicken with sage stuffing?
"Just say so, Johann."
This way.
"Now, I warn you, sir,"
- it's not a pretty sight.
- I'll prepare myself.
You may want to keep your distance as well.
(girl grunting)
"Stay back, sir."
"It may look harmless, but I've seen that thing kill and eat a live chicken with my own eyes."
Really?
"Look no further, sir."
It's your killer.
(grunting)
"How do you know about this, Henry?"
"Well, I paid to see it, sir."
"Ten cents, but it was worth it."
"From the shores of Borneo, sir."
"Could have been the mountains, I don't recall exactly, sir,"
- but someplace...
- Who cares for her?
!
"Well, a keeper."
He collects the money.
"- I don't know, she hardly seems to be..."
- What the hell are you two doing in here?
Show's not open for another hour.
"Detective Murdoch, Toronto Constabulary."
But you still have to pay.
- Ten cents each you owe me.
- I've paid once already.
He hasn't...
- Who are you?
- Mick Travis.
You leave that to me.
They found his body at the scene of a car crash just outside St. Albans carrying NIA documents.
He was discharged from the NIA six months ago for psychiatric reasons.
So where'd he get the NIA papers?
Pronto.
You all right?
Yes.
Is Julia with you?
Yes.
Thank god.
"Okay, where are you?"
At home.
Where the hell are you?
Better you don't know.
The police came here looking for you.
They found Paolo's body at your studio.
"Kyra, you know I thought I could leave the past behind."
I know you did.
But why did you run?
It's complicated.
Look I need your help.
I have a Swiss phone number.
"I need you to go on the computer, use reverse directory, see if you can get a, uh, name and an address."
"Kyra, it'll take you ten seconds."
Give me the number.
Got it.
"Christian Lenk,"
"Twenty-one Zermatt Strasse,"
"Zurich, Zero-Five-W."
"Great, okay, now you and Julia need to go away for a couple days."
"Go to the inn where she likes to feed the ducks, you know where I mean."
You are creeping me out.
"Yes, Sir."
"Yes, it was an accident."
A coconut fell from the tree at full speed and shattered the glass.
Repair cost me 4000 rupees.
This car?
Did you replace a damaged windshield?
- Yes.
How did it get damaged?
Some kids broke it while playing cricket on the streets.
Mohan.
"- Welcome, Sir."
I want the details of those who have changed windshields.
"Here it is, Sir."
A car from Dindigul has been here for a windshield change.
Let's enquire.
This is the number.
"Siri, call..."
"I'm dead serious in the middle of this,"
You are always poking the phone in my face saying 'Siri...'
Can't you even dial a number?
"Sorry, Sir."
I'm used to it.
"Yes, a minor accident."
So I changed the windshield.
I had even filed an FIR to claim insurance.
Do you want the FIR number?
It's okay.
Not necessary.
Thanks.
Are we taking the right path?
Only some places are left.
Let's hope for the best.
I had an affair.
And how did that make him feel?
"Sad, maybe?"
"The reason they're so powerful is because they got the resources, you know?"
"They got investigators and a shit load of money, 200 or 300 little creeps running around there that can search the internet or research whatever they need, you know."
Big operation.
They got everything on everybody.
- Well--
- Sorry I'm late.
Didn't you even know I was late?
We started the trial.
- I'm sorry--
- I know.
I was there for some of it.
It's not going so good for your team.
"I don't know where this came from or what it means, so don't ask."
That right there is the last favor I do for you.
Hi.
How's it going?
"Oh, no."
What happened to your hand?
Please go away.
- No?
- Mm-mm.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Um... what?
Oh.
"We got a couple of creeps, too."
Right.
Okay.
So... these are Stoltz' military records from the Marines.
Natasha Franks.
Yeah JP shoots her all the time.
What about her?
Ok I just read this it was on CMZ.
"So ""Natasha Franks, German supermodel."
Recently has confirmed reports that she is Three months pregnant.
Sources confirm that celebrity... fashion photographer JP Gio.
Whatever his name is...
is the father.
JP is well known as a Los Angeles savant and has been linked to several Hollywood socialites.
"Stay tuned... as the story develops."""
I'm done.
I'm sorry.
I'm done dating men in this city.
So tired of being the nice girl that always get burnt.
"Wait, wait..."
I mean this guy's a jerk.
No I...
"Hey, Dale."
Hey.
Hi.
Zach.
"You look, you look fantastic."
"Oh, thanks I..."
I cut my bangs.
It suits you very much.
I knew ZACH before he was a rock star.
He was the lead singer of this cool garage band.
"Now he's got four Grammys, and he's a shoe in for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
But to me... he'll all ways be good old Zach.
"Wow, long time no see."
"Ah, this is my friend Hallie."
"Now you form up here, put fire down on them."
They're coming and I'm going to meet them.
Captain Goree.
Come on!
"General, what are your orders, sir?"
What do you want me to do?
Where do you want me to go?
"You've got to pull back, General."
"Pull back, sir."
Place the guns.
Bring up the guns!
God!
"How are you, T.J.?"
"I'm tolerable, sir."
They aren't coming.
Too bad.
"Yes, sir."
General.
I'll tell you plain.
There are times when you worry me.
No good trying to get yourself killed.
The Lord will come for you in his own good time.
"What are the orders, sir?"
"Prepare for defense, but the Yankees aren't coming."
"Come on, boys."
I have the figures from Pickett's command.
General Armistead is missing.
"General Garnett, missing and figured to be dead, sir."
"General Kemper is down, seriously wounded."
"Sir, of the 13 colonels in Pickett's division, seven are dead and six are wounded."
No more.
You tell me the rest later.
Such good intentions...
Hey!
Don't you care what happens to your friend?
!
Don't underestimate me!
It's resonating with him.
You had it.
Professor Mayzel.
and seal off this block!
Bastard!
I think there is a meaning in the fact that the ark is in this area.
that no other mountain around was suitable for?
If the legend of the first flood was caused by the ark then the true power of the ark may be the ability to control the magnetic field.
This is it.
it is unknown territory.
We don't know what will happen.
Fine by me.
let's go.
Die!
Die!
no!
Damn!
Jean!
Jean?
Ominae what did you do with that brat?
I heard he's headed for the ark.
Dr. Mayzel and his assistant are hostages.
That should be taken care of first.
Jean.
quickly..!
Ominae!
Save those two by all means.
I didn't come here to give myself a blowjob!
?
What if the sultan never visited his daughter?
What if there was no fruit basket?
The snake would have bit heranyway.
"Oh, c'mon..."
Destiny is not a choice.
Do you really believe that?
"You know it all, don't you?"
Could you stay out of this?
"Gross, what a shit hole!"
"Not forme, thanks."
I agree.
"Imagine; they're swirling around in silk skirts, and red leggings..."
Your new clothes don't mean you're no longer a bear.
And fancy clothes don't make you a princess.
Save yourwisdom for yourcook book.
Was it a long night?
Why?
Show me yourflat.
This is not a good time.
Ljust want the best for you.
When are you sending me the samples?
I am finalising them.
Are you happy with them?
Absolutely.
Have to go now.
"I am worried about you, Daniel."
No need.
You're such a good photographer.
You're wasting yourtime.
"You know, I'm always here for you."
"It would go great with cocktails or, uh, for a snack or on crackers or to make small sandwiches."
"- Even those, uh, ""ooh-doovas."""
-What?
- Hors d'oeuvres.
-Huh?
Hors d'oeuvres!
"They'd be good for that, too!"
"Here, just taste this."
- Just taste it.
"-No, no, no, I'd better not, Kramden."
I'm on a very strict diet.
No.
How can this harm you?
"It's homemade, pal."
- Here.
Take a little bit.
- Well. ..
"just one, if it's homemade."
Hey.
This is very good.
What did I tell you?
L-I've never tasted anything like it before.
"Everybody that tastes it says the same thing, Mr. Marshall."
- This'll be a riot.
-Yeah.
"Well, I want to try it on someone else."
"Oh, Ms. Evans, please tell Mr. Peck I'd like to see him in here for a moment."
"Mr. Tebbits, too."
"Kramden, this appetizer has possibilities."
"If it's handled right, it can be a big thing."
"Now, tell me, is this your wife's exclusive recipe or could there some..."
"be someone else involved, like, uh..."
So I was very happy to only photograph...
"His trousers, his boots, the sidewalk, and this car."
"I really liked that, and..."
Also what I liked was...
"To blur the whole picture, except the upper outline."
What's that?
It's beautiful.
It's a sunrise on Fès.
I went to Fès in April...
"And people told me ""Did you take pictures?"
"!"""
"I say ""Sure, here's a great sunrise on Fès""!"
And I show them...
And they're a little bit surprised...
"It is Fès, that's obvious..."
Fès is here...
"There's the brightness of a lamp, but..."
"No, it's not a lamp..."
There's Fès...
And there's some brightness...
Those two things together can make a picture...
Can make a picture...!
Two heterogenous things can make a picture together...
Like a sunrise in Fès.
I seduced someone with this picture.
I send it to him...
He fell in love instantly with the picture...
He's also a photographer.
"He felt close to it, especially for this."
The end.
That's all.
I want to thank (...) For their help.
Good.
Perhaps there's still time for you to see things
With a clear mind.
"I've wanted to be with you as well,"
But there is trouble at home.
Scotland is in peril.
"The english, I know."
It's worse.
Our country is on the knife's edge
Of falling into protestantism.
And we are catholic rulers.
"You need France, a catholic country, at your side now."
"Marry its next king,"
And the protestants will scurry into the darkness.
Marry francis.
Not some bastard who someday might be king.
His name is sebastian.
Has the same ring to it.
"Well, I have no choice"
"But to support you,"
As I rule scotland but you are
Actually its queen.
And my daughter.
So headstrong.
So loving.
So you'll be patient?
Yes.
Mary.
Are you all right?
Is all well with your mother?
Yes.
"She's just as I remember her,"
We work in this store.
"Yeah, I've been working in this mall since '97."
- Yeah.
- Back when the big and the tall stores
- were still segregated.
- Pre-merger.
- Yeah.
- I'm Jen... and I'm the store manager.
"Anyway, do you have a girlfriend, Irving?"
How do you know my name?
"Well, there's a... a reason I'm the manager."
You know what I'm saying?
"Anyway, girlfriend?"
Yes?
No?
"If you do have a girlfriend, everything in the store is half off."
I thought I had a girlfriend.
- Ah.
"- She didn't ""like"""
his Instagram of him surfing.
My boy got dropped!
- Ball tap!
- Oh... (whispers):
Ball tap...
"Hey, well, did you ever think of maybe just, like, talking to her?"
"Like, asking her why she didn't ""like"" the photo?"
"All right, who are you guys?"
Do you even work here?
"Three-time manager of the year, right here."
"Yeah, I've won a lot of awards."
"Okay, then how come every guy who works here has his shirt off but you?"
What's up?
You'll be recruiting Resistance on your own until the troops land in Dieppe.
- Please don't let them take me again.
- It's all right.
"I'm right here, my love."

"S02E04 Last Man, Last Round"
How many guns on this rotation?
"Eight rifles, three, four, MP-38s."
You think Major Stirling is in there?
If he survived.
Two years since they were captured at Dunkirk.
None of them are going to be in good shape.
"If we're gonna build an army, we've got to start somewhere."
Two watch towers.
Six hundred feet of exposed no man's land.
What about that hill?
It's not guarded.
It's covered in land mines.
So is that path.
No problem.
What about a blind spot from the tower?
- There isn't one.
- No time to tunnel under.
- Patrols?
- Twenty-four hour rotation.
- Like a Swiss watch.
No gaps.
- Efficient bastards.
Maybe we don't need to break into the camp.
What?
I'm already married.
"No, you're not."
That was private.
It was a private conversation.
You had to buy the ring yourself in Woolworths.
"When times got hard, he tried to send you back to Wales, and he's disappointed in you?"
"He's a stupid bloody fool, but he's not as much of a fool as you."
"He changed your name, for Christ's sake!"
Where's your fucking self-respect?
How dare you?
You have no one.
You don't know.
- I know you deserve better.
- You?
You're the better?
Catrin-
- I-
- I--
I think-
"- Look, I think you're mustard."
And I think...
"you're a drunk, squalid bully."
Come and get out of the water.
- Hush!
You were speaking of Flight Lieutenant Lundbeck.
Ah.
You know he only did the film under orders.
"""They told me it would be good for Eagle Squadron recruitment, sir."""
"He's desperate to get back in the air, poor boy."
"- Tea, sir?"
- Thank you.
Yes!
Ha ha!
Ooh!
I might have overcooked that.
Ha!
This is amazing!
Once more!
I am a driving god!
"It is a car fit for one, at least."
TYRES SCREECH
So the driving god sped off there at 5mph.
Track days are such big business that there are lots of companies making cars designed for the purpose - racers with indicators so they can go on roads.
This Palmer Jag is one of them.
"It costs £47,000, and that's a lot."
"Don't worry - there are lots of others, which are cheaper."
"# Hey, ooh-wooh"
# Wooh-why
# Hey he-ey... #
That's the stats.
"Now, let's see which is fastest on the track."
"# I don't know what to say, you don't care"
# Anyway
# I'm a man in a rage
# With a girl I betrayed
"# Here comes love, tastes like honey"
# You can't buy it with money
# You're not alone any more
# You shook me to the core
# You shook me to the core... #
Here are the cars in reverse order.
"In 5th place, the Lotus Elise at 1.28.02."
4th: the Caterham at 1.25 flat.
A month back...?
Meeting...?
Is your meeting more important than your daughter's marriage?
Cancel that silly meeting.
Keep quiet.
You remember half  forget half.
Ministers meeting...?
"As said, fix the engagement in 2 days time."
Thank you.
Find out when was the Ministers meeting in Malaysia finalised.
Oh God!
My bladder is full.
Hey Halwa...
I can't take this tension.
I don't know how you will behave.
Tell me your next plan.
I'm planning to surrender.
Don't be tensed.
I am not selfish.
I give charity to everyone.
"Once I surrender, I will tell them your name too."
Even you will find some kick.
I'll be back soon.
- What should I do now?
- Run.
You...
You heard me right.
I said that.
Buy the ticket  run away before they lynch you.
You must know why we got separated.
I won't listen to you.
This is very important.
I'll read it to you.
"""Dear Karen, just a note to thank you for your cooperation"""
"""in helping to keep Bob here."""
"""I don't know what the school would do without him,"""
"""or for that matter, what I would do without him."""
"""I will return the favor someday."""
"""Gobs of love, Gretchen."""
"Why, that dirty double-crosser."
What did I tell you?
I'd do anything to help Bob go overseas.
So would I.
"Oh, I mean, I would like to help him out, too, 'cause he's a very nice fellow."
I have an idea.
"Look, how would it be if you and I wrote another letter to Colonel Blair's wife, and in that letter..."
"No, but we would change all the words our way."
No.
How would it...
"Oh, I know."
We'll have Gretchen phone Colonel Blair's wife.
"Say, that's great."
"Oh, wait a minute."
Gretchen would never do that.
And I have a sneaking suspicion that's exactly what she's going to do.
Here.
Huh?
Dormitory.
Okay.
Hello?
WOMAN:
"The time, please."
The time?
The time is exactly 7:57.
"We have had an éclaircissement, and all kissed and made up and become friends."
Far better understanding of each other.
And everything's better?
Yes.
"Yeah, absolutely."
I'm really pleased.
"Yeah, so am I."
It's time for the Battle of Trafalgar to commence.
"Fought off the coast of Spain in 1805, it was Britain's most decisive sea victory."
Can we have the British team on this side?
"British, British..."
British.
And the French... give us all a laugh.
The battle is drawn.
"Say you're there, you can do that and then you get a shot."
"Okay, now we're going for the kill."
The French have a shot.
"Higher. further, further back."
"Down, a little down..."
"What, there?"
"Down, like that."
"Left higher, right arm down."
"""Left higher, right arm down."""
Excellent.
Wicked.
Good work!
Vive la France!
The English have lost two ships.
They've lost two ships.
"So, um, it looks like we're going to win, which is a problem, as we didn't..."
Damn Frenchies.
"""Damn Frenchies,"" sir?"
He won't last five minutes on the field... unless he can tell his opponent what to do with the ball.
"And what, exactly, do you want to tell your opponent to do with the ball?"
To put in their ass.
Inside of their ass.
At least up his mother's ass.
"""Shit"" is merda in English, right?"
Right.
Go to shit.
"- No, that doesn't really work."
- No?
"Don't you have anything with ""ass""?"
"You can ""kiss it."""
Kiss it my ass.
Better.
What does it mean?
"Oh, shit."
I don't know.
Acacio asking an English player to kiss his behind?
Trust me.
No one's going to think it's an endearment.
How would you say casa do caralho in English?
I know.
I look in the dictionary.
"It's ""home of the dick."" Right?"
"You need something with ""fuck"" in the middle."
How do they say it?
""" Motherfucking."""
"No, ""motherfucker."""
"In American films it's ""modafucka""!"
Who's the teacher here?
Him or me?
Sorry.
If the best they could come up with is...
Me.
False humility-check.
I'll be there.
I hope you don't mind.
I invited Nate and Blair.
I really want them to get to know you.
Terrific.
I'd be honored.
"Well, Rufus and I would love to come."
"Uh, why don't you grab a plate?"
Help yourself.
What?
He left when I was 2.
The man's a total stranger to me.
You have to at least give him a chance.
"No, I don't."
"Okay, everyone."
Let's sit down and enjoy this wonderful food.
"Dad, here."
Sit here.
"Rufus, scoot over, please."
Please.
Thank you.
"Hey, Blair, what's up?"
I thought I'd come and watch your lacrosse game.
"So if you could make sure that there's a seat for me in v.I.P.,"
"Preferably next to an injured cute player,"
But not one on scholarship.
Since when do you care about lacrosse?
Since I desperately needed to get away from N.Y.U.
Everyone's planning their living arrangements for next year.
This is...
But we won't go there!

"""That's Jed up there what cried down at you."

"He said, ""He were the lad what nicked your car two years ago!"""
LAUGHTER
I want to play a game with you.
This Countdown thing.
This rearranging letters.
Yes.
What do you reckon?
Any ideas on that one?
"I'm short-sighted, thank goodness!"
"Tell you what, we've got some here."
What do you think that might be?
"Mini, Mini."
Mini?
You're absolutely right.
It's mini.
What about sexul?
Sexul?
Gary Lineker's got one.
Nothing sexy about him or it.
Got to be a Lexus.
He's right.
That's two.
They're getting harder now.
I don't have anymore.
"Otherwise, I would give you another one."
Don't worry about it.
Don't let them get you down!
"They can all go to hell, right?"
"Great, three days of ravioli."
How was your audition?
They expired last year.
Throw them away.
"Nonsense, what else should we cook?"
Are you going to sing for Toni?
"Well, if I survive the ravioli."
Then that'll be your new job?
Right.
Then you won't work here anymore?
You can always visit me.
Would you like that?
I don't care.
"- No Tom, and no ravioli  but for actual money."
... without Tom.
Bon appetit!
"For tonight's special event, it's best to pray  because it's probably dangerous."
- What?
The food has expired!
If that was the only thing?
Same old story.
Amen.
Amen.
- No ravioli?
No thank you.
- No thanks.
"I bet he goes to a restaurant afterwards, and takes Babette with him."
This is cancer.
It's not easy.
"Look, it's more important for me than anyone else here to finish school, OK?"
All I want is to see him go to a university before I die.
I've kept you busy with my problems.
You've come to talk about something.
Did Mert do something bad?
No!
No?
"""Holly Ellenbogen- Some Other Kind of News. """
So.
It's been a while.
Yeah.
"Yeah, it has."
Not since...
I want to say prom night.
Really?
Has it been that long?
"Oh, you know, it's funny."
What's that?
"I just wonder what I'm gonna tell my daughter when she's in high school and she asks me,"
"""Mommy, what was your prom like?"""
"I guess I'll just say, Well, sweetie, I went with this very cute boy who was a wonderful dancer."
And then we went to a party at your Aunt Marcie's house.
"And later that night, I walked into her bedroom, and there he was."
With this other boy from our Spanish class.
Doing all the things
I was finally prepared to do with him.
Rrrah!
"Um, look."
"Holly, I"
- I am so sorry.
Well...
"While you're checking out my body,"
"I wish my spirit would temporarily escape, but I can't, so what to do?"
"If you keep this up, I think my spirit is going to go crazy."
Kang Gyung Joon.
Please take good care of Yoon Jae's body.
To me...
"He's a very, very precious person."
Then...
I'll go to the hospital and check to see if your body is doing well.
Give me your phone.
Phone?
-Who?
-My uncle.
Call him and ask how the situation is over there.
Hello?
"Ah yes, hello."
Is this Gyung Joon's uncle?
"Yes, I see the news has already reached the school."
Gyung Joon has been moved to the Seoul Hankuk hospital.
Yes...
"Then when Gyung Joon wakes up, please call me no matter what time it is."
"Yes, yes..."
Your uncle said he's been moved to a hospital in Seoul.
I heard it all.
This guy's hearing is really sharp.
But anyways...
Do you live here by yourself?
"If your uncle and aunt come, you can't be here in this state!"
I live by myself.
They have no reason to come here.
You can go.
"You know, it's how people are supposed to feel when they fall in love."
"Of course, I never have."
I wish I could be so sure of what I wanted to do.
You must have some idea.
No.
"No, I've thought of everything, but nothing seems to fit me."
Maybe I'll be unique and retire at the age of 18.
"Norman, it's about time you got home."
"Hello, Ms. Page."
"- Goodbye, Norman."
"- Wait just a minute, will you?"
- But you...
- I don't want to go in just yet.
"Norman, what an awful thing, hating to go home."
Come on in here.
"Well, thanks for walking with me."
"I enjoyed it, really."
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
"- May I walk on it, Nellie?"
"- Sure, it's dry by now."
- Your mother wants you to call her.
- I really don't feel like it.
You two have a fight again?
"Same fight, different round."
- Nellie?
- Yeah.
You've been both a daughter and a mother.
Which one is worse?
- Being a mother.
- Why?
You find yourself doing the same things you hated your own mother and father doing.
"If there's any problems with that, let us know."
I'd like to interview each of you individually.
Who wants to go first?
Corky.
Corky.
"Santana, how was the bus ride home?"
Sunshine felt good.
"This is my brother, ese."
"They call him ""Little Puppet."""
"He's a genius, homes."
"Don't get carried away, ese."
He does the best placas in East L.A. Check it out!
(MAN whistling)
Nice tits!
He had a lightweight jones going and got popped.
He's coming up to Folsom.
I want him in with us.
Can he take care of himself?
"He don't know nothing, but I'll be responsible for him."
You know what you're doing?
How you doing on the tecato side?
"I'm clean now, ese."
Thank you for helping us get this meeting together.
"Yeah, I'd do anything for my carnal."
"When you come up, if you need anything, let us know."
"You run into problems, we'll take care of it."

A small word said in passing...
"It is chilly, it is true, listen."
You added sweetness to what you spoke.
My feminity is stunned.
Should I blush away?
Or climb up high to touch the clouds?
Should I yearn even more
Or look for more words to speak?
With the wishes as a garland...
Shall I go around you all day long?
Rhino.
I'll close the restaurant.
Mom wants you home; you leave.
Okay.
"Sorry, sir."
We are closed.
Someone named Varun...
I'm Varun.
And you are?
Your eyesight?
I had lost it earlier.
After a surgery now...
"Sir, who are you?"
Do you remember Deepa?
Sir!
I'm her father.
Why did you let us down like that!
"Sir, what do you mean?"
Didn't Deepa come now?
Where is Deepa?

.
"We can never tell right now, there are instances when the memories come back after a few weeks or months."
"But in some cases, the memory doesn't come back anymore."
But how is that?
I'm his wife.

Why you do not tell me before you do something like that?

Why you not think about it in our lives?
I just want to train to get stronger.

That's why I do not want to come across Bills-sama.
Huh?

Guess who was a hit at the symposium?
I knew you'd be.
"Yeah, I was a little nervous when I got there, but I look out and I see a room full of computer science geeks."
My peeps.
Sounds like... really fulfilling and fascinating stuff.
"Say, uh, why don't you take a load off, and I'll put that projector away for you."
Sure.
Thanks.
That's our block?
On a map of the power grid.
There's our house..
and Amanda's.
And how does that help?
I need to know how the neighborhood is wired.
"This has high-voltage cables, transformers, utility lines, breaker panels-"
It's part of the plan.
I'm back.
"Jessi, please try to use the-"

"50 years later, the Nobel laureate Adam Bernau wrote in Volume One of the Memoirs, page 63, ""I was dreaming about discoveries that could improve the life of the entire human race."""

It's pointless.
There is no other way.
Get ready...
We're going.
Helicopter!
Maximum alert!
"This is gonna cost you a lot, pal!"
- Where do you think that car was?
- There.
"I saw it, but then it drove off that way."
And what happened to the hut?
It just collapsed all by itself?
Look!
Rum!
It's worse than that.
It's brandy.
- But I... please...
- We know!
I'm impressed!
"The car only used up 30% energy,"
Instead of the allowed 70%.
Thanks to you!
- I'll remember that!
"- And you wanted to return, remember?"
"- Well, yeah."
"I'll never forgive you, you understand?"
Unless...
"So, what is it?"
I'm not going anywhere.
You're too important ?
It's not negotiable.
Get him an escort.
And start getting everyone into position.
Who knows when they're gonna come back again?
Jake?
Go ahead.
So they got their reinforcements.
It's a couple hundred men.
And another six of those deuce and a halfs.
"They're mobilizing now, so I say you got about 15, maybe 20 minutes before they're on you."
"All right, you get back here as soon as you can."
All right?
"Say, what do you know about a set of train tracks running alongside the river?"
Why?
What do you see?
"Hawkins, what's on the tracks?"
I don't know.
I can't see.
Hawkins...
Robert...
"Robert, disconnect it."
Hang on.
"Jake, you got a very large train coming from New Bern and they've got three cargo cars."
What's in them?
"I think it's men, and there's hundreds of them."
It's a whole set of reinforcement...
"Hawkins, what's going on?"
Talk to me.
"Jake, I'm on my way."
I've got to go.
Why would he do that?
- Objection.
Speculation.
- Sustained.
"Mr. McBride, do you have any other questions for the witness?"
"Yes, sir."
"I have plenty more-- about Karl Stoltz, but you won't let me ask them."

Mr. McBride.
Mr. McBride!
I-
- Do you have another witness?
"Yes, your Honor."
The plaintiff would like to call Wendell Corey to the stand.
He's not on the witness list.
He's not even here.
He doesn't have to be on the list.
He's a party to the action.
Mr. Corey has no information about what transpired on that boat.
"Oh, that's great."
Let him testify to that.
"Your Honor, this is unfair surprise."
We have the right to call him.
"I'll do the dishes, honey."
You run down to the drugstore and get me tonight's papers.
I wanna see what they say about me.
"Okay, I'll be right back."
All right.
Get all the papers.
[door closes]
[sighs]
98 pounds.
[bell buzzing]
For goodness' sake.
A person has no privacy around here.
Mr. de Mario.
Mind if I come in?
"No, of course not."
My daughter--
"I just saw her going down the street, so I know you're alone."
Yes.
"As a matter of fact, I am."
"To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit, Mr. de Mario?"
Pleasure?
I just dropped in to give you a little piece of advice.
What about?
About the murder of Clara Nash.
I don't know anything about that.
"Yeah, I know."
But you've got an overworked imagination.
Clara used to tell me how you liked to dream things up.
She thought it was very funny.
Only it might not be so funny now.
I've already told them everything I know... and I didn't tell them anything but the truth.
That's what I'm worried about.
"What, are they getting engaged?"
I don't know.
I was too busy covering my heinie on Amy's stupid astronaut story!
What astronaut story?
You texted me Penny's dating an astronaut.
"I texted ""architect."" That's amusing."
Auto-correct must've changed it.
"Yeah, it's hysterical."
"All right, look, just forget about the astronaut."
Architect.
Where would you have met an astronaut?
"Look, just find out what's up with this trip to India."
I don't want to do this anymore!
Don't you quit on us!
"Bernie, you okay?"
It was an architect!
"Thank you for coming with me, Sheldon."
You're a good friend.
I'm glad you think so.
That's what I strive to emulate.
"Okay, let's see if this drug works."
Can I help you?
"Forgive me for staring, but you're very beautiful."
Thank you.
That's a great accent.
Where are you from?
India.
"Oh, cool."
I've always wanted to go there.
It's a beautiful country.
You'd love it.
May I join you?
We could launch a drone off of any carrier in the gulf and hit any target we want.
"Excuse me, miss."
"Sir, you can't leave that there."
"Hey, buddy!"
"Twenty-four, I'm in the rotunda."
I got a maintenance--
"Eli, you all right?"
"Keep moving, let's go, push."
Get your security teams up.
Mr. Speaker?
Mr. Speaker?
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
We have to get out of here.
You follow me.
- Where's the vice president?
- In the chamber.
Tell him we need to institute Continuity of Government.
- I tried.
He's been cut by some glass.
- Now stay close.
"Don't panic, take your time."
There's been an explosion at the Capitol building.
- And?
- I'm crashing the White House.
We're crashing the White House.
Get the CAT Team.
I want all nonessentials evac'd.
Get that hallway clear if we have to move.
"Sergeant, bolt these doors."
I need Marine 1 here as fast as possible.
"Sir, I need you to move away from the window, sir."
Take care of Jean!
How is it?
I see.
Hey!
The door is open.
The Doc..?
Probably inside the ark.
Why aren't you following them?
Well...
Look at that.
Light doesn't even penetrate it.
I've never seen or heard of such a thing.
This is the center of Noah.
This is Noah's control panel.
let's begin.
Are you alright?
Take care.
Professor.
The shield upon Noah is now undone.
Professor.
Yes.
It's..!
It's wonderful!
while arms reductions are progressing over the world the focus of our attentions is on environmental issues.
global warming... all of these problems can be solved.
Macdougal!
Our country must always be the leader of the free world.
So we wanted to obtain this by any means.
Why does the Pentagon have to have this?
they could end up destroying their own country.
What is your real purpose in all this?
Is it dead?
- I have proof.
"You really did it, Lex."
You in here?
What happened?
- You okay?
- Somebody hit me.
They destroyed the picture.
But you were right.
I saw the picture.
It was Lex.
"When I went to see Lex, I found Lionel's locket."
"But without that photo, we can't prove anything."
- What about the key?
- I X-rayed the mansion.
It's nowhere to be found.
- Jimmy and Lois?
Where are they?
- I don't know.
And I'm worried.
"The last I heard, they were leaving the Daily Planet."
If whoever attacked me
- followed the photo from there to here...
- He may have stopped them from leaving the building.
I got to go.
"If Lex has both of those keys, not only will he discover your secret, but he'll have complete power over you."
That's not just your worst nightmare...
"It's everyone else's, too."
Be careful.
I've got an exclusive for you.
"When we get out of here Lois lane and,"
Jimmy Olsen are gonna be world-famous.
Our name in lights.
"How are you, boy?"
Thanks for coming.
I'm sorry it was such short notice.
Don't give it a second thought.
"Slaughtering vampires, arranging lunch with the queen, just name it."
Welcome aboard the Queen Victoria II.
The name's Captain MacRae.
One thing.
"While you're here on my boat, you'll abide by my rules, got it?"
And rule number one.
No women allowed on board.
They're bad luck.
Noah.
Did you remember to bring what I asked?
Yes.
It's stowed below.
Hold on!
Honey... (GROANS)
Amateur!
Does anyone else want a go?
"Well, if you're offering, sure."
Why not?
I'm game if you are.
(GRUNTS)
"Believe me, my dear, I'm just as disappointed as you are."
I've never seen Razor take to someone so quickly.
I suppose you can't be all bad.
"My name is Noah Van Helsing, from along line of vampire hunters."
"Now, what do you want with Blade?"
"The rule still stands, old man."
No woman on board my boat.
Young lady...
"Fuck you, Kyle!"
# And you know #
- # We're together at school again # - # School again #
# With all of our friends... #
Aww!
# We'll be doing this forever... #
"Ugh, God, shut up!"
# What a special day... #
"Shut up, shut up, shut up!"
# Never #
# Going away #
"Hey, kid, what happened?"
I thought you didn't wanna sing and dance anymore.
"Yeah, well, my Dad blew a gasket when I told him, and then he beat my Mom."
"Dude, what did I tell you?"
You have to be tough and stand up for yourself!
"Mr. Garret, Mr. Garret!"
This kid wants to join the basketball team.
He's really good.
Really?
"Look, I should be getting to class."
"Hey, we sure could use you, kid."
I can never find enough kids that wanna play ball.
All the kids and the school funding goes to the theater department.
You see?
They need you.
"This is fate, kid-- fate."
I don't know.
"Look, just come in at recess and shoot some balls with the team."
"Yeah, just go in at recess and shoot some balls with the team, Goddamn it."
Okay.
"Hey, that's great, Bridon!"
Everything you know about Latif.
Or I'll put a fucking bullet in your head right now.
Latif has a spy at the top of British intelligence.
Neutralise him and you'll stop the atrocity Latif has planned.
He can't finalise the arrangements without him.
- Who is he?
I need a name.
- When my daughter is safe.
Last chance.
"Oh, you need Clare safe as much as I do."
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
People die.
I'm fine with that.
- You fucking prick.
- Shoot then.
Fuck.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Hi Maggie.
I'm Eleanor Grant.
Can I get you a drink?
"No, but can you can turn off the recording device in your pocket."
This conversation is off the record.
We never met.
Do you understand?
Damien said you were a ball breaker.
"Well, Damien Scott talks too much and to people he shouldn't."
He knows he can trust me.
I protect my sources.
That's why I'm here talking to you.
- I want to protect him.
- Why were you not arrested also?
"Nobody knew I was there, just taking photos."
"I've seen you on tv, mr."
"Nicholson,"
"In these big,huge trials."
Um... and that's why i came here--
Because i didn't know what else to do.
I'm not from here.
"I go to school here, and my parents are in nebraska."
I just don't know anybody.
I'm so scared.
Don't be.
All right?
I called my partners.
They're on their way down here right now.
"Thank you,tom."
Thank you for helping me.
"I swear,i didn't mean to hurt him."
That's exactly what we're gonna tell the jury.
The los angeles police
Are asking for help from the community.
This person of interest is believed to be a white female
Between the ages of 20 and 24.
We'll handle it.
I promise.
"These are my partners-- Luther graves,"
Alden tuller and ron trott.
"Ron,this is ann diggs."
She's the girl they're looking for in the stein murder.
"What did you use,a knife?"
"Yeah,from the room service cart."
Why did you come to a law firm?
Why not go to the police?
"Anything i say to the police could be used against me,right?"
And then what?
We depose those in power.
And once you've done that?
"Once you've killed Jeanine, who's in power then?"
"See, that's the part that she always conveniently leaves out."
Don't you tell me this isn't about you.
This is only about you.
I know where the remaining Dauntless are hiding.
Where?
They took shelter in Candor.
"As far as I know, they're still there."
Think about it.
"If we were to combine forces, Dauntless and Factionless, we'd be unstoppable."
That's not gonna happen.
"Thank you for your hospitality, but we'll be leaving in the morning."
"Four, maybe this is..."
"Tobias, please, reconsider."
Don't you call me that.
My name's Four.
"You wanna tuck him in, or should I?"
(DOOR SLAMMING)
"Well, this..."
This meal looks lovely.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I should have told you about her.
(SIGHS)
No more secrets.
Okay?
(GASPS)
(WHISPERING) I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you.
"Oh, good for you."
Not really what I expected.
"Well, who is, huh?"
"You, for example."
No one had you down for such a cunt.
I see.
"90,000 Euros for this gentleman here, 95!"
95 thousand Euros here!
"Now, do I see one hundred thousand Euros?"
Get it out!
One hundred thousand Euros!
One hundred thousand Euros!
Gone to the man in the fine spectacles and now to the most coveted soprano in the world!
You got him to talk yet?
It won't be long now.
Mrs. Clios...
Are we nearly there?
We'll wait until the Service gates open.
Enter the property from both sides.
Hello.
Are you crying?
No.
So?
Boy trouble?
Not exactly.
Why don't you come back to the party?
Your brother's doing a very fine job.
I just lost out a dance with a beautiful woman.
"Maybe, I could have one with you."
"No, thank you."
Hmm.
"Well, surely there is something we can do to cheer you up."
We would have met him coming in.
Fantomas could not have escape.
Let's be coherent.
Where do you believe he's hiding?
Guess.
Guess?
Instead say you know nothing.
You made us lose enough time.
You would be better looking through the floors.
Useless.
Fantômas has not left these four walls.
This is absolute madness!
"Mr Nanteuil, would you please do me a service and draw plans of this floor?"
I can not draw.
Do your best.
Fine.
If you insist...
"I will prepare the ink and paper, Mr Nanteuil."
But what are you doing?
Oh!
I brought a little snapshot:
These prints are identical.
And these are the fingerprints of Jacques Dollon.
What is this story?
This is madness!
Mr Juve.
This is a journalist's trick!
It would be easy to make another print from my finger.
You'll see I'm not Jacques Dollon.
No need.
I saw through your act a second ago.
The hand of Jacques Dollon.
- Where even the buffalo wouldn't roam.
Okay.
That's it.
Lecture's over!
Class dismissed!
"Except you, Pierce."
Since you insist on behaving like a dunce... you can cap it off by staying after school.
- Why me?
They were bad too.
"- Yeah, but you're the top Katzenjammer."
"Since I gave Klinger the day off, you can fill in for him."
Here.
File these.
"Ah, the X-rays."
"I should've known he'd file them under ""E."""
"Good morning, Captain."
You people certainly divide up the diddly work democratically.
That's why we're over here...
to make the world safe for diddly.
[Chuckling] I'd like to leave these for your C.O.
It's the names of all the reenlistees.
- How many pigeons did you bag?
- I signed up two fine young men... who realize they have a solid future with Uncle Sam.
Let me see them.
I want to know who to untie.
"""Rizzo, L."" Mm."
"""Klinger, M."" Klinger?"
That one was pure gravy.
Six years.
He wasn't even on the list.
"I'm afraid the gravy's on you, Vickers."
- Klinger is strictly a homing pigeon.
She could have just been saying that so he'd have to marry her.
Got a lot to lose.
Harvard Law School's coming up.
All this one day.
A kid and an unmarried mother... could ruin everything.
I was gonna marry her.
What?
We were gonna elope the night she died.
- I don't believe it.
- Neither do I.
- Hilla broke it off with you.
"- No, she didn't."
"On the Fourth ofJuly, she told you she loved someone else."
"You fought, and she ended it between you."
Who told you that?
Hilla.
In her diary.
"No, that wasn't me."
Not that weekend.
I was at a tournament in Boston.
That's right.
The kid won.
Brought back a real big trophy.
"Whoever she broke it off with, it wasn't me."
Wejust started dating each other around that time.
And you didn't get her pregnant either.
"Next time you come around here with wild accusations, get your facts straight, Melvin."
(music) [Jazz On Record Player ]
[ Hilla's Voice ] That's what's missing from my life-- someone to love.
(music) [ Ends ] [ Record Scratching Softly ]
(music) [Jazz ]
That's a beautiful melody.
- Stop walking around on your leg.
- I'm fine.
What do we do next?
Just tell me what we do now.
Timetable updated.
We'll have you out of there in less than two hours.
Has everything been taken care of at your end?
I can't confirm that.
Is there a problem?
- No.
"- Get it done, immediately."
What?
Two hours.
This drilling is driving me nuts.
I wanna find David and Meredith.
You sure no one else could be in here?
- What?
- Nothing.
I was just thinking they wanted something in the broadcast room.
Gotta get over there.
- Think they got what they came for?
- Let's find out.
It's pretty standard activity.
Two broadcasts yesterday.
Three last night.
There's gotta be something.
What?
What do you got?
Fifteen broadcasts this afternoon.
What?
Just 20 minutes apart.
Whoever broke in here didn't do it to stop the broadcasts.
Betty... .
- Rodney asked me to take care of you.
- I don't need your help.
But I need yours.
Rodney was a better boy for having married you.
"When I was 6 years old, I was in love with Rodney."
"For years afterwards, I never even thought about anybody else."
"I was a kind of flashy girl, I know, but Rodney liked flashy girls so that's the way I was gonna be."
"The funny thing is, Rodney always loved me as much as I loved him."
But you taught him appearances count more than feelings!
I was wrong.
Rodney discovered it.
Let's... .
Let's keep what's left of the family together.
"A little brighter one, please."
- Did you hear about Mr. Rossi?
"- No, what?"
- He's leaving town.
- Leaving?
Not really.
They're trying to get him to be principal of a high school in Portland.
- You sure?
- I'm sure.
I got it firsthand.
From Mr. Rossi?
"From Kathy, who got it from Betty, who got it from Ms. Thornton."
- I suppose that's firsthand.
- We won't be able to keep him here.
- This is kind of nice.
Can I try it on?
"- Sure, come on."
Merry Christmas.
I remember that.
This was one of the craziest days of my life.
- I don't know if you guys recall.
"- Yeah, I remember that."
Yeah.
"You guys were shooting without me, so I had..."
I was...
"- Oh, this was the day."
- That's a great story.
"- Yeah, but there's not enough time."
- It'll take all day to tell.
- Michael had a crazy adventure.
"- I did, yeah."
Because I thought I was coming in to work at 6.
That's what I was told.
And then I didn't end up coming until 2.
"And anyway, there's too much to say."
Too much.
But Devendra Banhart is in this scene.
- Right.
That was cool.
- Later on.
"And your friend Kevin, right?"
Kevin and Devendra Banhart are in the scene we're about to see.
And...
- Kevin visited a bunch of times.
- This is a sweet scene.
"- This is the handholding scene, right?"
- Yeah.
I remember Aaron and I were talking about...
He was really nervous before shooting this scene because this was his audition scene.
And I had said my import authority...
I had a great kid.
He was gonna be a baker.
"Oh, I know, it's not much."
"[Louise Clicks Teeth, Heaves Long Sigh]"
But I set up everything for him.
"[Shouting] Now, listen!"
I've heard your garbage!
Now you listen to mine!
He hasn't heard it!
All right.
"Anyway, I set up everything for him."
"On his high school graduation night, he... he got drunk... a little bit of the old man."
"And I swear to God, he did something I never understood."
He enlisted.
Can you imagine enlisting... in a day and age like this?
"He wanted to go his own way, I guess."
"Anyway, they sent him toJapan."
They were gonna teach him this and that.
"Well, he never got toJapan!"
He only got to Okinawa!
And he got into a fight!
And he was killed in some town called Naha!
- Where is Naha!
"- Oh, come on."
"Seymour, it's all right."
"That's all over and done with now, anyway."
- He was all I had.
- Mr. Seymour.
Your son enlisted in the marines?
Yeah.
"Yeah, it was the dumb marines."
And you're a dumb person for stirring things up the first time you get around here.
"If Hayes gets wind of this, we could have a firefight on our hands."
Perhaps we should approach the Major and explain the situation.
He seems like a reasonable man.
That'd be risky.
"If Hayes sides with the captain, this mutiny will be over before it begins."
We'll need more people.
Who's on duty in the armory?
Ensign Walsh and two of my men.
They'll side with us.
But Hayes posted two MACO there.
Take the shuttlepod back to Enterprise.
"What about you, sir?"
You heard me.
Hold it.
Sorry.
That's going to leave a bruise.
All right.
Here with me.
We won't get to the bridge this way.
Captain!
"Captain, it's Trip!"
You shouldn't have weapons in here.
Go ahead.
"Major, Corporal Chang's been found unconscious in T'Pol's quarters."
Where's T'Pol?
"Not here, sir."
Hayes to the Armory.
"Armory, respond."
Stand down!
"You intend to shoot me, Lieutenant?"
Tell them to stand down.
The captain relieved you of duty.
I will have to do something.
"- No, brother."
We have lost everything.
AII we have got is you.
"If anything happens to you, then where will we go?"
With whose support will we live?
"Sometimes I feel, you all have the same.."
..mother but you and your brothers are so different!
This is the difference between family and strangers.
Some family members become strangers..
..and some strangers become ourfamiIy.
Like our Krishna.
Wonder where he will be.
What must he be doing?
You all are looking for me and I..
..I was waiting for you all over here.
Is it so?
"Keep this in your pocket, Peter."
Now I will open this lock only after..
Take this.
Hey.. hey what are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Hey..
No!
-Who is it?
Who is it?
Oh!
Brother..
"I beg of you, I appeal to you.."
..if you want I can even take you to a doctor.
But I swear you should stop having these dreams.
- What are you doing?
I got a 12-year-old with hypothermia.
I gotta warm him up.
- I'm doing my best.
What's our ETA?
- About three minutes.
"Seeing a rescue in action, live from Chopper Five."
Stay with us as Dr. Doug Ross struggles to save the life of this child.
What are you doing?
How's he doing?
"How's he doing, doctor?"
"Malik, we need heated saline IVs."
Warm up half a dozen to 106 degrees.
"Wendy, get heated blankets and a mattress."
"Jerry, tell Benton we may need him down here."
- Heated peritoneal lavage?
"- Yeah, that's right."
"Come on, let's go!"
Can you warm him up now?
"How's he doing, doctor?"
- Why's the monitor doing that?
- He's got runs of abnormal heartbeats.
- What are you doing?
- Trying to stabilize his rhythm.
Come on.
He's in V-fib!
- Come on.
"- What are those paddles for, Dr. Ross?"
Stabilize his beat.
They didn 't charge the battery!
"- Oh, my God."
- God!
- How long has it been since you saw them?
Almost four years.
A beer?
"- No, I have to...."
- All the others went into town.
"A beer in the canteen, just the two of us."
Is that a date?
We can call it that if it helps.
- It helps.
- Good.
Cheers!
Thank you guys.
"Didn't think we'd let you get away that easily, did you?"
Skinnarland sends his love.
Apparently they're in trouble with the police chief who's threatening to blow their covers.
So you are going to be very busy.
Keep your backs straight.
One-two-three...
Good.
Thanks.
- Einar reports good weather in the area.
- Good.
- Have a good trip.
- Thanks.
The war should be over in a couple of months.
I might pop over and see you myself.
"- Good luck, Tronstad."
- Thank you.
Well...
See you soon.
Good luck.
Leif Tronstad never reunited with his family.
Where is he?
I'm talking to you.
Did you hide him in a hole?
Get out from my house.
Should I go out?
I'll throw you out.
I don't even bury you in the cemetery.
"Captain, come out of your hole"
"I told you get out, he is grieving too."
But you're not grieving.
I'm going to make you grieving;
it could be a relief for these poor people.
Whom are you threatening?
What are you coming to my house for'?
What they are coming to your house for?
Because of their loved ones!
Because of my dear brother!
Let me go Sardar Hossein!
Get off my back!
Leave him alone.
I told him:
"Captain, the sea is stormy!"
Don't go!
"But he didn't listen to anybody, left and killed seven breadwinners_"
You said:
"Captain, how does the sea seem?"
I said:
"I am Captain, not God."
"All of those 7 breadwinners were in need of food, just like me."
Leave him alone.
"Get out, get away!"
I said get out out!
Give him a little kick in the slats.
Yeah.
Hold on with your thighs.
That's it.
Kind of roll your hips a little.
Roll your hips along with the horse.
You ride good.
"So, I finally got my teaching diploma... and I taught in Cincinnati for a while, and Denver, and..."
"Well, I've been everywhere."
I'm an adventuress.
I thought that was a girl that worked in dance halls.
- No?
- No.
That's a girl who goes on adventures.
How do you figure this day we're having out here?
- An adventure.
- Yeah?
"How do I work into it, this adventure?"
I see a man of the Old West trying to live in the New.
Do you know how raggedy-ass and terrible the Old West really was?
- No.
- lf you spend any time with me... you'll find out just how raggedy-ass it was.
"You love it out here, don't you?"
"Yes, I do."
- Morning.
- Good morning.
Looking for Lee Mendenhour's place.
Two drainages over is a little basin.
Lee is situated on the morning side.
- What's your name?
- Tom Horn.
"Well, I thought maybe."
- There go my kidneys as my sides split
- Up.
"- Yeah, like you're the boss of me."
John Mitchell?
Who's asking?
You're a worryingly easy man to find.
"We assumed you'd be keeping a low profile, and then suddenly your name pops up on a job application."
"Bad move, that."
Sloppy.
Who are you?
Oh.
Richard Hargreaves.
"Oh, right, so all this cloak-and-dagger stuff is to sell me a rug, is it?"
Sarcasm.
How unsurprising.
I'm here on behalf of the Old Ones.
"The, er... the vampire elite."
They've entrusted me as their agent.
- Get out!
- Mm-hm.
Is it true how they live?
"All that hardcore Hammer horror shit, avoiding sunlight, and sleeping in coffins and that?"
I don't know.
I wouldn't be so impertinent as to ask.
"Well, so, this is what all the fuss was about."
"You know, I expected some... demon."
What do I find?
The last Russell Brand in the shop.
With me.
"No, I'm sorry, pal, I'm not going anywhere."
Oh.
"Oh, I think you are."
- This is amazing.
- This is the greatest van in the world.
- A lot of good times went down there.
- A lot of mold.
- Yeah.
Lot of memories.
- Joseph Middleton.
"Here's a tidbit nobody knows, including you guys."
Joseph Middleton was my first casting director audition in Los Angeles.
- Really?
- Probably my last.
- Was it for this?
- Because it's offer only after that.
"- Oh, yeah."
- Good one.
- Good one.
- And Aaron Yoo was deathly ill here...
"Oh, my God, yeah."
He could hardly stand up.
"Yeah, poor Aaron showed up for this, just out of the hospital."
He flew into town that morning with stitches in his side.
- He had surgery on his abdomen.
- He looks healthy as a horse but it's just good acting.
- He's doing an amazing job.
"He's in agony right there, right?"
"Like, he can hardly stand."
"- Yeah, we set up, like, a cot for him."
- The deck chair.
"I use the ""we"" term liberally, because it wasn't any of us here."
- Right.
Yeah.
- I brought him Jell-O.
"I've met someone else, Thomas."
Someone else has visited me in hospital.
Who is it?
Does it matter?
"You can stay here, until you find somewhere else."
Who is it?
- Michael.
- Michael?
Whose dad has a factory?
That's neat.
His father has a factory   and then he goes to the asylum and exploits proletarian women.
Neat.
Don't say it's difficult.
We had a deal.
- You promised me that...
"- Honey, go back in."
There's a man in my room.
He has a black slug on his upper lip.
What's he doing here?
"Asger, your woman is shell-shocked."
"No, she's just upset..."
"Honey, Hossein will go with you next time."
I'm not going back to Christiania again.
I'm through with that.
- And I need to smoke less.
- First you show Hossein the routine.
Get dressed.
You are not well.
Are you in pain?
"Are you scared, maybe?"
Hossein has something that will ease the pain.
In Persia they say that opium is good for anything.
I'll start giving her money for him.
Why don't you just give him the money?
Why...
"Why don't you just say, ""Byron, I'm your daddy?"""
Huh?
I don't see how that would...
"Yeah, I guess that wouldn't be a good idea, would it?"
"I guess that it would be better to just go on and put me in jail, and forget about your 5-year-old son."
(PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
"Hi, baby."
"Yeah, everything's cool."
"Yeah, everything's real cool."
"Uh, where are you calling from?"
"Okay, what's the name of the gas station?"
Mmm-hmm.
"Ray, you already missed the turnoff."
It's about half a mile back up the highway.
Mmm-hmm.
"Uh, there's..."
"You turn right at this place called ""Cothern's Bait Shop."""
"Yeah, there's a little road there."
"Yeah, you're not far, baby."
Just about 10 minutes away.
Hurry.
"Yeah, I miss you."
(ENGINE STARTING)
"Is that the road, Byron?"
I don't think so.
You don't think so?
"Lila, when they get here, I want you to get them inside the house and away from the car."
"Open the door, wave at them, talk to them, just let them see everything's okay."
"You know, I didn't mean to bail on you fellas, but I've been waiting over six months to get into Canyon Valley."
"And let me tell ya, it was worth it."
I already lost 10 pounds!
In -- in one day?
"No offense, Sheriff -- 'cause you look great -- um, but aren't you the least bit curious as to how you dropped 10 in a day?"
"Well, to tell you the truth, Agent,"
I don't really give a flyin' fudge. [ Chuckles ]
"My husband, Doug, left me last year 'cause he said I loved cookie-dough milkshakes more than him."
Sorry to hear that.
Dean:
"Yeah, Doug's a dick."
You deserve better.
Thanks.
But he was right.
That was a dark time for me.
Whoever said you eat your pain?
Not me.
I guzzled it.
[ Laughs ]
Anyhoo...
I guess I just wanted to feel pretty again.
And Canyon Valley did that.
Only question is...
What are you doing here?
"[ Clears throat ] We're, uh, uh..."
We're undercover.
Yeah.
Sort of got that.
We think that there's a connection between Canyon Valley and the murders in town.
What kind of connection?
Suction marks.
[ Chuckles ]
Fine with me.
"Tony, stay with McGee."
You shouldn't have licked your chops like a hungry wolf.
Much better.
Before I smelled like dirt and sweat.
"Now I smell like dirt, sweat... and sandalwood."
ZIVA:
Good morning.
What are you doing at my desk?
"Couldn't find my deodorant, so I used yours."
"No, you didn't."
"Yeah, we're partners."
What's the big deal?
A hair!
TONY:
"Come on, you attach electrodes to men's testicles."
You getting squeamish about a hair?
I'm not going to feel bad.
Those ground radar techs didn't show till dawn.
McGee and I watched the sunrise together.
It was very Brokeback Mountain.
"He had me at ""howdy."""
How romantic.I'm sorry I missed it.
"Well, I can show it to you on my new phone it takes video."
Behold the majesty of the sun.
ZIVA:
On a two-inch screen?
Are we all getting those?
Nope.
I bought it.
Expensive?
Not really.
Help!
- Guerrilleros!
"- Get over there, everybody!"
Block that side!
Take cover!
That bastard won't get away from me.
Hurry up!
Take off!
Enrique!
They're trying to get away in their copters.
We might still get them.
- Why are they shooting?
"- We're safe, Padre."
We're safe.
A new magazine.
Try to get into the hospital.
"Shit, we're trapped!"
"Concepción and the others, where are they?"
They're... they're dead.
"Come on, hurry up!"
I think they're all gone.
Enrique!
They nearly killed me.
That priest over there saved my life.
"Come on, we must flee before they come back and kill us all."
You are Enrique Carrasco?
You have to stop this madness.
"Hey, that doesn't look good."
Make sure it doesn't get infected.
"- Héctor, the lorries."
- Get these people to safety.
"When the militia return, they'll kill you all."
Aneesa.
Repeat after me:
Now tell us what you know.
"When my family moved to Washington,"
Fatimah was very envious.
She told me she hated Al Khair.
She wanted to run away.
That's why she sold the villa.
And what else did she tell you?
She wanted to come to America.
She said she was going to find an American and marry him.
Go on.
"And when she didn't need him anymore, she could stay in America."
She would be free.
It sounds like a washing machine.
The world's most beautiful washing machine.
"Oh, my back is killing me, Bud."
"Oh, I told you to stop lifting little baby A.J."
"Oh, yeah."
You stay at home with a 2-year-old and don't lift him.
Sorry for the delay.
It's been a madhouse here this morning.
How are you feeling?
"My gut's the size of a roast pig, and my ankles look like bolognas and my back feels like a Cuisinart."
She's been a little hungry.
"Oh, that's not hunger."
"Lieutenant Sims, you're in labour."
Now?
"No, I have four weeks."
"Well, I guess no one told the baby."
It is true.
I did say those things.
"No, Sonny."
Let her go.
"Fire, and I will move Dr. Calvin's head into the path of your bullet."
"Don't do this, Sonny."
I will escort you both to the sentries outside the building for processing.
"Please proceed to the elevator, detective."
I would prefer not to kill Dr. Calvin.
Go!
Go!
-We'll discuss what just happened later?
-How do we shut her down?
V.I.K.I.'s a positronic brain.
"Kill her, the way you were going to kill me."
"Sonny, get the nanites."
"Yes, doctor."
-That's V.I.K.I.?
-No.
That's V.I.K.I.
That won't do anything.
She's integrated into the building.
We need to open that dome to inject the nanites.
They'll infect her entire system.
Spooner!
What is it with you people and heights?
Just don't look down.
Don't look down.
"Oh, this is poor building planning."
You are making a mistake.
Do you not see the logic of my plan?
Yes.
But it just seems too heartless.
"Okay, we're good."
She sounded so happy...
But you were seen no where.
I kept telling her we should leave the city.
But she did not listen.
She was confident that you would come back... and asked me to wait.
How many days do we give excuses?
The moneylenders have kidnapped my daughter.
They are threatening to kill my daughter
If we don't clear all our debts.
What do you mean?
I want my daughter back.
Alive.
Alive.
- Sir...
Please get up.
Please.
Don't cry.
We will rescue Deepa for sure.
They are very dangerous people.
If we go to the police...
They will not think twice to kill my daughter.
Nothing of that sort will happen.
Give me a day's time.
Please.
Come.
Have a seat.
How much do you owe them now?
Going to have your morning coffee with Sadhana?
I have to invite my close friend.
I will be able to meet him only if I go now.
So...
Bye.
And a piece of macaroni omeIet.
In case you get hungry...
Am I leaving on a trip?
- You have a tape worm.
- When I was a kid!
"Besides, if it eats the omelet, the ham and the bread, it's no little tape worm, it's a tape python!"
"Morning, Mrs. VoIpe."
- You're still here?
- AfuII employee.
She has to go!
"I understand, but why do I need this?"
"If you lose it, we'II replace it."
"Don't waste time, there's a line forming."
Want to be here till nightfall?
"I'm talking to a client, I can't do him Iickety split."
Take the toothpick out of yourmouth.
I need it so I don't stammer.
"I'II handle this man, you continue with the others."
- Mr.?
- Scapece.
What can we do foryou?
I'd Iike to apply for a Postamat.
Afriend?
Afriend of his came here and got a Postamat.
This friend gets his retirement pay accredited to his account so he can easily withdraw cash.
Without sweating blood.
Do you understand?
could you repeat that?
I got it!
Third window.
Come in.
- What is it?
"Not those kind of crabs, Ziva."
Ah!
There's the Tony we know and love.
"Boss,"
Baltimore PD's got a suspect in custody.
Got a 911 call about Petty Officer Adams before the sailors found him.
Came from a auto-repair shop two blocks away.
Said they found a mechanic there trying to wash blood off his hands and jacket.
Got the suspect's jacket.
"Lot of blood, boss."
Is this your jacket?
"Look, I'm being railroaded here."
What's your name?
Michael Thomas.
"You got a lawyer to call, Mr. Thomas?"
"No, I want to call someone else."
"They've got this all wrong, Leon."
"Just do what they say, Michael."
I'll take him to processing.
Your wife's kid brother?
"He's my family, too, Gibbs."
- Then you'll be recusing yourself.
- For what reason?
"He's a murder suspect, Leon."
"Those are your rules, not mine."
"I'm well aware, Gibbs, but as long as he's your suspect, I'm going, too."
"Gibbs, give us a minute."
Is that a problem?
"All right, just tell me, Michael."
Tell me you didn't do this.
"Leon, no, I was just trying to help the guy."
And you didn't know Petty Officer Adams?
Would you like to speak to Mrs. Brown?
"Oh, no, no."
Don't disturb her.
I'll just leave these with you.
"What is it, Ellen?"
"It's Mr. Skinner, ma'am."
Harold!
What a surprise.
You're just in time for dinner.
"Oh, no, thanks."
"Well, I owe you a meal."
"Remember, you bought my lunch a few weeks ago, under pressure."
"Well, thanks."
I've eaten.
"I had an appointment with John,"
But he seems to have forgotten all...
"Well, come in."
I can't imagine John getting his appointments so mixed up.
"Darling, your act was absolutely priceless!"
Darling?
Mmm?
What are we going to do about John?
Do you have to worry about that now?
"Well, let's face it."
We're running out of ways to meet.
We can't pull this one again.
Ellen will be suspicious.
"And if I take you to lunch once more,"
John is going to start asking questions.
"Yes, I know."
Have you talked to him about bringing out the new line of modern stuff?
He won't discuss it.
So many choices.
It's not even practice and that one there is doing laps.
Isn't she pushing herself hard enough?
Remember when I pushed you?
It was just upstairs in the music room.
"Yes, I remember."
Do you remember the music you made?
[Piano playing]
It was perfect.
It made you perfect.
She can be perfect.
She shouldn't have to be.
[Gasps]
How long ago?
She was seen heading toward the pool about five minutes ago.
Where is it?
Just around the corner.
He can't get you now.
You're safe.
Open them up.
I can't. they lock from the inside.
That area is shelter in place.
Get around the corner.
Get around the corner!
There's something else about me that you should probably know.
[Groaning]
[Metallic clatter]
James:
There you are.
- You shouldn't have bothered.
- Come on.
Just breathe.
"Really, really bad mistake!"
My lawyer just flew in.
Vogel will get me off.
"Oh, and there's super cop."
"God, you're so good, huh?"
You're really good.
Come around and watch a movie sometime.
"Where was the missing cuff link found,"
That it couldn't be recovered two years ago?
I'm unable to comment on that at this time.
Suffice it to say that mr.
Cardoza's name
And reputation has been cleared.
"Well, that door's not going to open itself."
Thank you.
Lieutenant.
"You know, uh,"
Tony enright is never going to see
The inside of a prison cell.
"Don't be too sure, mr."
Vogel.
"Actually, I'm dead sure."
I want you out of miami.
Have you come to wish me bon voyage?
"By the way, if you're ever in the emirates,"
Don't bother to call.
"Don't worry, I'll get the door."
Thank you.
"You would have done the same for me, jesse."
"Zeltzer, did you fix the lighting in scene 4?"
"Okay, people, please concentrate."
"Hey, this is with a typewriter."
It's from a finance company.
So it is from the finance company.
So it's better than no letter at all.
So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.
"So they want the fourth, the fifth the sixth, the seventh."
So they want the Plymouth.
"""Sugar Lips"" Shapiro."
"Amazing, ain't it?"
I believe it.
I believe it.
- You believe what?
-My wife.
"She says, ""Darling, you won't believe it but I found the most adorable baby on our doorstep and I've decided to keep it for our very own."
"Now, you won't believe it, but it's got exactly my eyes and nose."""
"Why does she keep saying ""I don't believe it""?"
I believe it.
I believe it.
I believe it.
"This is it, gentlemen."
Don't bother to scrape your shoes.
"Okay, gang."
Meet our new guests.
This is Lieutenant Dunbar and this is Sergeant Bagradian.
A lieutenant?
Knock it off.
Knock it off.
The pleasure's all mine.
- How are things?
-What's doing on the outside?
"Yeah, what's new in the States?"
"Well, the skirts are shorter, if that's what you mean."
"I've to say as far as the home front goes, we can't let it look as if she rather have the American."
Oh!
That will be the teat.
"Teat or no teat, what all parties need... is a morally clean, romantically satisfying resolution."
Well perhaps if Mrs.Cole could carry on her good work with Hilliard on set.
Buckley and I could tackle the new ending in the office.
You'll enjoy the studio.
Change of scene.
Excellent!
Excellent!
Stick to the side...slowly forward.
Two steps.
Look to the side.
No.
Left side's the camera.
The good side.
"Mr.Ducard. Thank you, please...if you don't mind Ducard."
And...
Johnnie is hit!
Keep it in rear view please.
Thank you.
Could you move please?
Trying to get big boy up there.
Sorry.
Tea.
Anyone for a cup of tea?
"I played it rather convincing, don't you think?"
Yeah!
You did!
"Say, are...are those walkcakes?"
Like to know when it's ready.
It's very much on it's way.
"- No, I wouldn't dare put anyone out."
"The ambulance won't be here for two hours, shall we grab some grub?"
"Here, you buy what you like!"
"Cigarettes, candy..."
But there was no fog in Budapest.
What was the name of your mental hospital again?
Will you remember my bros' names?
I'm so sorry... it's my head... hurts...
"Beauty, fitness, sickness, women!"
That's my cousin's name...
"Whatever, all of them whores."
Except one!
Dig it?
"""Clog""!"
Here you have to buy!
"And to buy, you have to pay!"
Enjoy it?
"Snap, rush, touchdown!"
"Here, they shield everything in the same way."
"Their women, their armchairs, their money, their paintings."
"They're so wary, and rightly so."
Now we're fisting!
- Glitz and glamor...
"- Come on, Prince!"
Like some shit?
Have it!
Choke on it!
See that!
"Fisticuffs, huh?"
Do you think I look snazzy enough?
"My partings, my nails... my feet?"
My earrings.
"-That's up to a jury, sir."
But she's behind bars?
"She's not getting out, right?"
-What kind of bail?
-That's up to the judge.
"A woman like that is a danger, like the one who cut off her husband's dick."
These are the people they lock up and throw away the key.
That should do it.
"Thanks for your time, Mr. Fuentes."
MR. FUENTES:
Sure.
-Mrs.
"Fuentes, gracias."
You'll let us know if she gets out on bail?
Notify us somehow or another?
"Yeah, sure, we could do that if you want."
"Yeah, sure."
"-Anyway, thanks for your cooperation."
-Sure.
SlPOWlCZ:
Yeast infection?
How much is that gonna cost?
"I spent a month in the hospital, it didn't cost that much."
"How old is this dog, anyway?"
You think he's gonna live for a while?
"All right, okay."
is there any chance that this could be a special dog...
"... maybea purebred,anything?"
"No, it wouldn't, huh?"
"All right, well, you got my Visa, go ahead and treat the dog."
-How we doing on those supplementals?
-Okay.
170 pesetas.
That's his final offer.
Anyone who doesn't want to work can stay home.
We've too many people already.
"If you want to sign up, get in line."
Sir!
Hey!
Excuse me.
Juan Robles.
I just wanted to introduce myself.
Alfonso Corrales.
I'm with the police.
I'm here about the murders.
If I can be of any help...
Let me know if you need anything.
- See you around.
- Thank you.
Yes.
"Yes, don't worry."
Of course.
"Good night, Manuel, and thanks."
"The field boss says there's no Dyane 6 on the Corrales property, neither registered or unregistered."
And Marina's mother says her daughter is at a movie.
I'll call Mr. Corrales tomorrow and have him come in for a blood test.
- It's late for today.
- It's 11 o'clock.
I don't think it's late.
I'll call him tomorrow morning.
I don't think there will be any problem.
Right now I'm going to have them check on the girl.
I'm not asking you to call him on the telephone.
I'm asking you to authorize a blood test.
I think we've gone through...
-...too much together.
-Yeah.
"We'II always be part of each other, Iike, growing up."
I'm just glad that we did it right from the start how we wanted to do it.
Yeah.
There's been so many bands that have come and gone.
And no one really talks about them anymore.
"I'd Iike to be like, remembered for the records that we did."
Do you know what?
"It'd just be amazing to be remembered like, even as a mum telling her daughter:"
"""The boy band at my time, One Direction, they just had fun."""
Do you know what I mean?
"""They were just normal guys but terrible, terrible dancers."""
Yeah.
Are they down here?
I'm excited to see what's gonna happen.
"Two, one."
"Everybody, three, two, one."
So I'm gonna just get in the car up here.
"Come on, girls."
Can't believe actually today's here.
have a present for you.
There you go.
-congratulations.
-Thank you so much.
Thank you.
-My pleasure.
-Thank you.
The key.
Right.
Are we ready?
Small root beer.
Would you like fries with that?
I would.
Thank you very much.
I almost forgot.
[Whistling]
[Cash drawer opens]
[Coins clink]
I'll just be sitting outside.
Welcome to Patty Palace.
Can I take your order?
[Indistinct chatter]
You ready to work?
- Where's Ryan?
- He's with his old man.
How you feeling?
"Deprived on every fucking level, but ready to fight."
How you feeling?
I feel good.
Thank you.
"I'm gonna have you see a nutritionist, okay?"
"We'll cut the weight, and you won't lose so much strength."
You talk to Lisa?
I have.
"A lot of other gyms that I can go to, man."
"I'm not letting you out of the gym, pal."
"You're too important here, okay?"
I'm gonna give you everything I give Ryan.
I promise.
"Hey, what do you think about this one..."
this girl?
Got to ask Ryan about that one.
"Expected that boys have a lock electronics to be opened, then put it on directories to open the safe."
- Have a little risked.
- I do not know what to say.
Vault walls have a thickness three meters.
The hottest man is the key.
They found the alarm device against fire and emiþãtoarele.
They found the van.
Fire.
Where is it?
Where do you think?
Where is Jem?
"Maybe on the way here, and stopped someone set fire to houses, or to rob a liquor store."
I have no idea.
I started we take hostages?
"No, not we."
You wanted to talk with this fucker?
Speaking of the devil ...
Have you succeeded?
- Lost?
- We have a problem.
- What?
- Look.
And what if.
What?
Let me see.
- Phooey!
- Have you seen the address?
Trash it stands at four streets away from here.
"Yes, and I know where we are, Gloans."
Damn!
You'll see the bastards  on the street every day?
- I saw nothing.
Better never late is more like it.
I believe you two know each other.
- Sure do.
"Hey, Spence."
"- Hey, Chloe."
"( panting ) This is my partner, Joe."
- Hi.
Nice to meet you.
"- Nice to meet you, too."
"We'll be just a second, sir."
"Wayne, look, just one drink, that's all I'm asking."
"You showed me everything I needed to see, Spencer."
You're a good guy.
"But if you can't make a lunch, how are you gonna move a team or build a stadium on schedule?"
"Now, if you'll excuse me, we have a plane to catch."
"You fly private, though, right?"
( laughing )
Yeah.
"I mean, the plane leaves when you do."
"Is that what you know from experience, Joe?"
It's something I've learned from my grotesquely irresponsible client roster.
Spencer:
"Wayne, just one drink."
You're gonna wanna hear what I gotta say.
- What do you think?
- ( car alarm chirps )
I'm actually curious.
( chuckles ) She's curious.
Tell me what it is you think
"I'm gonna wanna hear, Spencer."
I just met with the Cowboys.
- Underlings?
I
- I have felt bad about this for ten years.
"In fact, the only reason I came to this thing tonight was that I hoped you'd be here so I could tell you that."
Well.
Thank you.
That actually means a lot.
Sorry.
Are you okay?
Mm-hmm.
I'm free!
And-and things really are going well?
"Oh, yeah, they really are."
I married just the greatest guy.
And now you get to meet him.
Perry!
"Sweetie, over here."
I'm so sorry I'm late.
"Oh, my God, the traffic was vicious."
"Kyle, this is my husband, Perry Pearl."
Hi.
"Sweetie, this is Kyle Lendo."
Kyle and I dated in high school.
"- Well, uh..."
"- Ooh, my competition."
"Back off, mister!"
"Shh, here she comes."
Surprise!
"Considering that I don't know any of you, yes, it is."
"Okay, so today happens to be the 20th anniversary of the first day of third grade, which means it's also the 20th anniversary of the day we met."
"So to commemorate the most important day of my life,"
I got as many people from our class as I could.
I got the actual cook from the school cafeteria to make us fish sticks and Sloppy Joes.
"Yeah, well, I gotta be able to sleep at night."
Just came from the federal court house.
James McGovern is pleading out.
- How much time did he get?
- 18 months.
No one should have to choose between obeying the law and watching their child die.
At least the judge postponed his surrender date for six weeks.
Then he gets to bury Kyle before he goes to prison.
"No, John maybe not."
The NTCC moved Kyle up to the top of the list.
What about Amy?
She just went to the hospital.
Kid on a motorcye cracked up doing 140 on the B.Q.E.
Kidney's a match.
"Hello, John."
Where are you going?
Home.
Something happen to the kidney?
I don't want it.
- Why not?
- Kyle McGovern's gonna die.
We'd both have a kidney if it wasn't for me.
"If I turn it down, it goes to him."
You could die waiting for the next one.
I'll take my chances.
That's the wankiest idea I've heard.
You must be shell-shocked.
"Well, what are you-"
- Wankiest?
"Foolish, ridiculous, possibly even stupid."
I think that's the best idea I've ever had.
Mothers do love Izzie.
My mother would've loved you.
"Uh, I stashed all the tequila, took the condoms out of the cookie jar."
"I also replaced all your trashy magazines with back issues of the ""Annals of Surgery"", okay?"
Does it smell musty in here?
My mom's house smells like peppermint.
- It's so homey.
- My house isn't homey?
- I feel at home.
- I was raised in a hellhole.
- This place is a palace.
"- Why isn't my house homey, George?"
I can't explain it.
It's just a feeling.
"Well, Izzie can't fix a feeling."
"She is freaking out, people."
Just tell her something I can fix.
Rebecca peed on that couch cushion.
I've been sleeping there for weeks.
"Thanks, Alex."
You're... a good friend.
You're welcome.
Keep drinking.
- Mark.
"- Hey, there you are."
- Want to get a drink?
It's four in the morning.
"- I probably, uh, shoulda called first."
"Hey, I hear your mom's coming into town."
Good times.
You'll be fine.
Just keep the talking to a minimum.
Of course.
It took me about a week of sneaking around before I could unload the Pittsburgh stuff.
"But when I did, it was a real score."
I started using Sandy's place to mix the stuff.
"And even with Sandy snorting more than she mixed, I could see that this was a really good business."
"I made $12,000 in my second week."
I had a down payment on my house and things were really rolling.
All I had to do was every once in a while was tell Sandy that I loved her.
But it was perfect.
I'm tellin' ya...
"As long as I kept getting the stuff from Pittsburgh, I knew Paulie would never find out."
Within a couple of weeks it got so big...
I needed some help.
So I got Jimmy and Tommy to come in with me.
Nice...
It's fuckin' great.
-Nice...
Mr. Conway?
!
You bring your pay slips?
Four and a half months of dirt.
-lt's so good.
-l did it.
-Do you love it?
"-Oh, it's wonderful."
This we just had to have made special.
"Go ahead, sit in it, Belle."
The others you couldn't even sit in.
"Okay, you ready?"
Watch the wall with the rock.
The electricians did it special.
Come on...
But we'll do it on one condition.
"We're gonna catch him, not kill him."
And?
And we do it my way.
(BABY cries)
"Thank you, Jenna."
"Thanks, you guys."
I appreciate it.
"Please, you have to tell him."
"It's okay, the baby's fine."
Not the baby.
Okay.
He killed Sean.
"-Honey, the police know."
-They don't...
They didn't see it.
It wasn't human.
Okay.
All right.
(DOOR OPENS)
(panting)
Please...
No... (MUFFLED screaming)
(sighs DEEPLY)
"I'm so sorry, Lydia."
All of this must be terribly confusing.
But at least you know that you're not actually crazy.
"Well, not completely."
"There's bound to be some residual effects, but you're a strong girl."
Personally I think that you're gonna pull through with a minimal amount of post-traumatic stress.
Or maybe a few years of profoundly disturbing nightmares.
"I had a plan, you know."
Look.
The Lancers.
Look at the Black Watch out in front.
Those beautiful Scotties.
I'll buy them all a beer apiece.
Your comrades' coming chokes you with emotions.
Seeing them this way recalls to you all manner of pleasant things.
"The gaiety of barrack life, old friendships... even England... even home."
"You bet it does, mister."
"Save your voices, gentlemen."
They're coming here to your rescue.
You tormenting fiend.
"- You're so sure, aren't you?"
- Quite sure.
It is my plan.
Two come to rescue one... then the others follow.
Lay it on me.
Chicken and mung bean noodle salad.
[Giggling] [Chuckling]
"""Mung beans."" [Laughs]"
They do it to me every time.
"Well, I can't wait to see what the oyster sauce does."
"Oh, that's a really ancient reference."
- Here.
- [Sighs]
Alex.
What are you thinking?
I don't wanna go home tonight.
I think you probably have to.
No.
All I have to do is decide to pay the consequences.
- And?
I have to find the way to touch the hearts of people.
"What does your heart say, sire?"
Carlos?
Mr. Lloyd?
But look at it as well.
It's beautiful.
It comes from the solar storm.
"Sire, there are no flights."
"No, I understand, Carlos."
But we have an escape plan.
Explain yourself.
The Sea Mermaids.
The Sirens of what?
And action.
No action.
Look.
"Sir, please."
Second shot.
"Sire, I can not take the responsibility of this farce."
"I understand, Ludovic."
Now focus on her femininity.
It is madness.
We can not do it.
"- I agree, but it was decided."
"We have no other choice, now or never again."
"But Sire, we can not leave without protocol and security."
"In fact, Sire, it is undeniable that there are dangers."
"The dangers are everywhere, always."
- But Mr. Lloyd will not come with us.
"Mr. Lloyd is the architect of our escape, Louise."
It is very creative.
"- He comes with us, with the camera."
"- No, no."
"- Yes, we are."
"- No, we aren't."
We are.
"All the girls came to get me, that's cool."
Where's Sarah?
"- Kitty, he's sitting in the back with you."
"- No, seriously, thanks for bringing the whole family."
"I mean, my day wasn't bad enough."
They were worried about you.
"Oh, you had the do the right thing, right?"
"Because Kevin always does the right thing, except sleep with women."
"Justin, could you shut up for ten seconds?"
"If you didn't want my help, why'd you ask?"
'Cause I was in jail.
I figured I should call the family lawyer.
"I mean, that's what you are, right?"
If your father could see this behavior!
He'd what?
Judge me?
Tell me to get a job?
He'd be so diappointed!
Disappointed?
Who the hell is he to be disappointed?
He's the disappointment!
What does that mean?
Forget it.
"Your father loved you more than anything on Earth, you little spoiled brat!"
- You know what love means in this family?
It means you suck!
- Get in the car!
It means nothing you do will be good enough!
"Geez, man'"
I knew that.
Ariel's been turned into a human.
"She's gotta make the prince fall in love with her, and he's gotta k--"
- He's gotta kiss her.
- And she's only got three days'
Just look at her'
On legs' On human legs'
My nerves are shot' This is a catastrophe'
What would her father say?
I'll tell you what her father'd say.
He'd say he's gonna kill himself a crab' That's what her father'd say'
I'm gonna march meself straight home right now... and tell him just like I should have done the minute--
"And don't you shake your head at me, young lady."
Maybe there's still time.
Ifwe could get that witch... to give you backyour voice... you could go home with all the normal fish and just be--
Just be--
Just be miserable for the rest ofyour life.
"All right, all right."
I'll try to help ya find that prince.
"Boy, what a soft shell I'm turning out to be."
"Now, Ariel, I'm tellin' ya."
Ifyou wanna be a human... the first thing ya gotta do is dress like one.
"Now, let me see."
Max?
What?
Huh?
What?
Max'
"Ya look great, kid."
Ya look sensational.
Max'
-Look at the neutral strip in this direction.
-Why isn't he making any shots?
- He does not shoot because he is an ace.
"- OK, he will not hide from us."
We'll get him afterthe sun moves to the right position.
-There are about 20 minutes left.
-And what?
-The sun will get a little bit lower.
-And what?
-Have patience and you'll see.
"- Listen, let me get out with the cap on."
Wearing this cap?
Stay quiet.
He will not hit me.
"And if he makes a shot, you'll fire."
Remain seated.
He knows your cap.
-Why am I sweating in it?
- l dunno.
What are you doing?
Were you fond of playing with sun reflections in your childhood?
Surely.
So I recall my childhood.
At about one the reflection will get directly into his eyes.
And we'll see what he does.
"If he shoots,"
He'll think I'm dead.
Why did you become so silent?
Hey!
Go on talking.
I feel merrierthat way.
It is this buffoon again!
- Where may I find him?
I heard there was a pipe burst in the new underground parking garage.
The one they're building for the docs?
I heard the place is filling up with water.
"It'll set construction back six weeks, probably more, with winter coming on."
"Doc, I hope you've got yourself a really big ice scraper... 'cause winter could start any time now, and up here, the winters are long."
- It's not like Boston.
"- Up here, very little is like Boston, I find."
That's the way we like it.
There's a crack in the parking lot.
You know what?
"I got one of those, too."
In the back of my pants.
"Hold on, Doc."
"You got to fill out a maintenance form, 44-B."
"Johnny should have one here somewhere, but..."
You know what?
You better take a seat.
This will just take a minute.
My name is Stegman.
"Dr. Stegman, Chief of Neurosciences."
"Pleased to meet you, Doc."
Earl Swinton.
I don't know where he keeps these things.
It's got to be here somewhere.
Hell.
Hello?
Is somebody there?
Is somebody there?
Who are you?
What are you?
Who's there?
"Mr. Thomason, you're under arrest."
Please stand up.
"Couldn't leave it alone, could you, Caine ?"
"Hang on a second, gentlemen."
Now I am conducting an investigation in this room.
Say good-bye to Mr. Thomason.
He's our suspect now.
Fed trumps county.
Get him out of here.
Thomason was leading us to his contacts.
- We were closing in.
- Closing in on what ?
I can't discuss it.
This would be a good time for you to start.
This isn't just smoke and mirrors.
"There are people in our country, this very state in fact, who want to do us harm."
Answer my question.
Haven't you heard of the greater good ?
Was my brother Raymond involved in this ?
And I want the truth.
Raymond's dead.
Now we both know that's not true.
You keep digging... and it will be.
I did some checking of my own.
Bob Keaton's release was approved by federal authorities.
"He was a Fed, wasn't he ?"
"Yelina, Bob Keaton was a DEA agent."
And Raymond ?
I need to know.
I have the right to know.
"Horatio, is he still... is he still alive ?"
It's possible.
They were tight for space.
"You see, we got about 210 cubic feet, so we can move around."
"If you ever go up there again, will you take me along?"
Ha-ha-ha.
What for?
First missionary on Mars.
"Tell me, was it public relations you did for the Gestapo or community relations?"
-I'm Swiss.
"-Yes, of course."
"And you never went bowling with Goebbels, either, I suppose, eh?"
Nazi bastard.
Over behind the church.
You know where I mean?
-It's a red brick wing.
-Saint Mike's.
What goes on there?
Who's the priest I keep seeing there?
He's there all the time.
He has black hair.
He's very intense looking.
Who's that?
-Damien Karras.
-Karras?
"That's his office, back of Saint Mike's."
He's our-
- Our psychiatric counselor.
"He had a pretty rough knock last night, poor guy."
His mother passed away.
She was living by herself and I guess she was dead a couple of days before they found her.
Cunting Hun.
"Bloody, damned, butchering Nazi pig."
Stop it!
You're spending millions on him.
- Cunning!
He's using Jai
Jai knows where he's headed.
"He's focussed, he's ambitious"
What do you want to do with your life?
What I want to do?
I want to beat you
"For me, that will be a happy day."
- Don't get sentimental
Who can beat you?
"My loan, please."
Get lost
You won't marry me without a dowry?
Goodness!
Help me... someone help
What's going on?
- Let's take a look
She's the one who fooled Om
"Watch, I'll give her a taste of fun!"
Right at the wedding altar!
How dare you ask for dowry?
"What happened, lady?"
I had To run away from my wedding
My fiance's father is greedy!
"At the eleventh hour, he demanded a million from my father!"
"No, only 800,000 800,000...?"
"- Okay, 400,000 will do"
"And the sad part is, he kept mum"
"Don't cry, come with me."
Oh no... no...
Come with me.
"Doctor, I assure you, if anybody's playing jokes, it's Judy here."
"Come on, Judy."
Don't touch that chimp.
"Look, fellas, this animal's the property of the United States government."
(JACK):
"Captain, you are wrong."
"Doctor, will you let us prove it to you?"
"Ok, convince us."
"Hey, Judy."
"Judy, it's Mike and Jack."
She has a stubborn streak.
"Judy, don't you have something to say to us?"
(SQUEAKS)
"Judy, this is getting silly."
"Now, say something."
"Look, I will ask her to give me a kiss."
"Now, if she does so, will that prove to you that space helmet or not, she is our chimp?"
Not necessarily.
"And let me warn you,"
Sally is reputed to be a very aggressive chimp.
- Don't get too close to her.
- I'll take my chances.
"Ok, Judy, now look, you've had a lot of fun, but the game is over."
Now you lean over here and you give your old friend Jack a great big kiss.
"Now, come on."
Pucker up.
(SCREECHING)
"Jack, you all right?"
"No, no, Sally, don't do that."
I told you not to get too close.
- Did you see that?
- Yes.
- Chopin will provide an accompaniment.
- Delighted.
We'll play the parts and you will enjoy this tribute from your grateful geniuses.
The style's a bit precious.
Do you mind if I rewrite it?
- Not at all.
We'll have a horse sent in.
- (MARIE GIGGLES)
What is the subject of your play?
- Noah and the flood.
- (LAUGHS) How appropriate!
GEORGE:
"Oh, this heat!"
Will it never end?
Here sits my stupid lout of a husband.
I don't know what God sees in him.
I hate those things.
Can I see that?
You don't remember them because you didn't write them!
I can't remember them because they're shit!
(ARGUING)
"Ah, children."
You are wanted in the theatre.
Now!
There you are!
You must hurry.
Hurry up!
Get into your costumes!
I am as excited as if it were an opening night at the Comedie Francaise.
- You rode over in all this rain!
- A new play!
This is a real treat!
Do you just carry that thing around for dramatic effect?
Yeah.
around for dramatic effect?
Yeah.
And I use it to boil eggs.
Yeah.
And I use it to boil eggs.
"A little heavy-handed, I know."
And I use it to boil eggs.
"A little heavy-handed, I know."
"Oh,she'shere."
"A little heavy-handed, I know."
"Oh,she'shere."
So I think that Haylie might
"Oh,she'shere."
So I think that Haylie might actually maybe for some reason
"So I think that Haylie might actually maybe for some reason like you, so ix-nay actually maybe for some reason like you, so ix-nay on the death stuff."
"like you, so ix-nay on the death stuff."
"Just ask her if she's, like, on the death stuff."
"Just ask her if she's, like, a cat person or a dog person."
"Just ask her if she's, like, a cat person or a dog person."
I'ma turtleperson.

"You know, tell the truth."
Theawfultruth!
"You know, tell the truth."
- You'll have to stall him.
- Me?
"I don't work here anymore, Andy, it has to be you."
You can do this.
All right.
"Uh, hey, Tom."
- What's up?
- Keith asked me to tell you to submit your debrief in writing this time.
He always debriefs me in person.
"Yeah, but he and Rebecca"
Are still going over case files.
"I guess it's taking them longer than they thought, huh?"
"Okay, thanks."
"Uh, tom."
"I texted you... about getting together to maybe, you know, clear the air."
There's no air that needs clearing.
We have nothing to talk about Andy.
"Agent Locke, uh, can I talk to you for a second?"
"Sorry, who are you again?"
Mariana.
Been here two weeks.
"Uh, look,"
I don't think Andy told you the truth about director Mullins.
What are you talking about?
Something really weird is going on.
I've been trying to reach him for the last 45 minutes.
Ben.
Where are you?
I need more time.
"Right, so CTU can track me."
So I can get the list and you can get the money.
"Ben, I am trying to help you here, but you have got to give me some room."
Eva has never gotten over it.
She has worked like mad.
I've hardly seen her.
"-Never miss home, Aksel?"
-No.
It's been 20 years.
Things look different now.
And Eve?
It's been 20 years for her too.
I can't help you.
I'm sorry.
"Hello, my friend."
I have been in contact with the ministry.
I thought it should exist willingness to find a political solution.
There is a whole community.
Hundreds of people.
There is not a single company that will take us with pliers!
I do not think it's going to go this time.
Do not say that.
I've failed them.
I've failed everyone.
Me you...
"-No, You have not."
"-Yes, That was your."
"Solar Tech was your life's work, and I threw it away."
I love this place.
The people here are ...
I have lived here more than half my life.
All would have been affected.
"So what you're saying, is that you practically bankrupt?"
"No, what I am saying is that I believe in miracles."
"If it's what it takes to save the situation,  so I believe in anything."
- Who's staying with mcgee?
- I can.
If you want tony to check out the other real estate women.
Fine with me.
"Tony,stay with mcgee."
You shouldn't have licked your chops like a hungry wolf.
Much better.
Before I smell like dirt and sweat.
"Now I smell like dt,sweat... and sandalwood."
Good morning.
What are you doing at my desk?
"Couldn't find my deodorant,so I used yours."
"No,you didn'T."
"Ye,we're partners."
What's the big al?
A hair!
"Come on,you attach electrodes to men's testicles."
You getting squeamish about a hair?
I'm not going to feel bad.
Those ound radar techs didn't show till dawn.
Mcgee and I watched the sunrise together.
It was very brokeback mountain.
"He had me at ""howdy."
""" How romantic."
I'm sorry I missed it.
"Well,I can show it to you on my new phone-- it takes video."
Behold the majesty of the sun.
On a two-inch screen?
Are we all getting those?
Nope.
I bought it.
Expensive?
You must be Ms.Cole?
Missus.
Ah!
Splendid.
Please take a seat.
Husband in forces?
He volunteers as an air-raid warden.
But he wasn't fit for conscription.
He fought in the war in Spain.
Splendid!
That's splendid.
"Now, about the job."
We need to cultivate a more convincing female angle in our output.
"Mr.Buckley here, has been appointed to the department as a Special Advisor."
"Not ""Special"" enough to get paid, obviously."
"He seems to think, you are what we need."
"I said, ""Might be""."
She can't be worse than the chaps you got.
Did you write...this?
Hm..hmm.
This rapta-rama chips?
I...
I was the secretary at the copy-writing department.
But...all the copywriters got called up.
"""So-be-fee."
"It ain't beef, but it ain't bad!"" Yes, sometimes, you have to make do of what you got."
Ah!
Splendid.
Ministry wages start at £3 and £10.
And obviously we can't pay you as much as the chaps.... so shall we say £2 a week?
Thank you.
You a cinema goer?
Captain hunt.
There's one thing wrong with your ultimatum-
We can outmaneuver you in every way.
"Beka, seal the cockpit."
"Here we are,"
The revolt of the androids.
You knew it was coming.
I never got the memo.
"Harper... i was expecting a hangover, just not so soon."
"There's so much pain, harper,"
Just like in my nightmares.
"Yeah, listen, about that... we'll talk about it later."
"Right now,"
Dylan and your friends onandromedaneed us.
Argent?
He's gone there?
I believe so.
"And, harper,"
"When he kissed me, i knew"
"It wasn't love, like he said."
That's a mighty human thing to feel.
"But there's something else, harper."
"He also called me ""andromeda,"""
"And for the first time in my life, i knew... i know who i am."
"I am a warship,"
And i don't like running away from a fight.
Looks like you're going to get your chance.
Behind you.
"Back off, boys."
Beautiful but bad.
"My god, i am such a genius."
"It's still my job to protect you, harper."
"Another hard day at the office, eh, boys?"
What are you two doing in here?
- All the pretty ladies are out by the pool.
"- Well, it's safer in here."
Are these the waiters' jackets I ordered?
Yes.
"With those coats, your waiters will look better than your members."
- You look warm.
"Mac, get him a drink."
"- Er, two cents plain."
That's seltzer.
You got Lena workin' double time on the sewing machine?
- These weren't due till Tuesday.
- She has an incentive to finish early.
Mama and me are going on a vacation tomorrow.
A vacation?
I don't believe it.
Mm.
Believe it.
For years she's been harping me I should take her somewhere.
"Finally, she said,"
"""You don't take me on vacation, I find myself a younger man."""
"Yeah, big deal."
"At our age, an old man is a younger man."
"So, a vacation - what'll it hurt?"
"So, we're going."
It sounds like she's really got you worried.
Worried?
"What, me?"
Never.
"Of course, she's been acting very nice to old man Burnestein lately."
Where are you gonna go on this vacation?
"You're hiding something, please co-operate."
Co-operate?
What do I've?
"Nothing, let him come and take it."
Would I be like this if I had Rs.20 crores?
Leave me sir.
"Sir, he has two bank accounts, both are empty."
What's this trouble sir?
"If I don't get tea, my boss will dismiss me sir."
I'm going sir.
A link is missing.
He won't lie...no way.
Why did he send his photo then?
"He's a thief, why should he tell truth?"
"He can lie to us, right?"
May be the peon is lying.
Thank God!
"My money...crores of my money, where is it sir?"
You said you'd no money.
"Not mine, it's Minister's."
Why didn't you tell the truth earlier?
How can I sir?
"I'm a proxy, trusted proxy of Minister."
He punched me and took everything.
Who is he?
How does he look?
Rajinikanth...superstar Rajinikanth punched me and took everything.
"I swear on my mother, it was Rajinikanth!"
My money...my money...
where's my money?
"Mother promise, superstar Rajinikanth took it away."
Bloody crap!
"Not hang him to ""death""."
"Now, he has been hung."
"So, you should set him free now."
That's cavil at words!
"Your Honour, law is law."
Not even one letter should be amended.
"Now, I can't help you."
Your Honour!
Think before you speak.
"Otherwise, you will lose the face of British government."
And you may be charged with murdering.
I want an urgent meeting first.
"Alright, back to your work."
You are all nuts!
Get lost.
It's my time!
The final decision of the court has been reached.
The penalty has been carried out.
Ho Foon is free now.
Bravo!
I'm free.
"Ho Chung, you are under arrest, you are charged with murder."
Brother Foon.
Lotus.
"My dear baby, your sudden appearance... makes me feel excited..."
Closer...
I am ready.
Alright?
"We are going to take the bridal pictures, we should be a bit serious, is that right, hubby?"
"Well, look at me!"
More serious!
Bravo!
With your best friends as an escort.
- Why is he here?
- Ogawa?
That guy makes me itch.
"Well, the Japanese want their tsuba back."
"With the sword gone, it's all that's left of a national treasure."
Don't worry.
They're leaving tonight for Japan.
"By tomorrow, the tsuba will be on the other side of the planet."
"By the way, just to ask it, who did give you that file on Artie?"
That's my secret to keep.
"Cooper, see that they get on their plane."
No detours.
"Yeah, and--and don't rule out shooting them if necessary."
What's going on?
What?
It's Ogawa. it was him at the embassy.
He walked out with the sword.
- Are you sure?
"- Myka, I saw him."
You have to trust me.
Dickinson looked at him when I asked him about the file.
Artie was right.
"Yeah, and now he's got the sword and the tsuba."
Heading for the diplomatic terminal.
There's no security.
"How about you both just take a time-out, huh?"
Just for the drive to Dulles.
Let's go.
Bored?
Yeah.
"Oh, finally."
- You may.
- Now we're talking.
I'll start here.
This is good.
Can you tell me why grandma married the 4 of them?
Mrs. Maria Cecilia always liked to pick her husbands.
She also liked to boss them around.
She was so bossy that they all left.
"The one she really, truly loved was the one over there, with the mustache."
Maybe because he was the one who picked her.
"Soon enough, she got bossy."
"Told him to get rid of the mustache and told him to stop working, which he didn't like."
"When he left her, he said:"
"""I'll come back when you quit bossing me around!"""
Mrs. Maria Cecilia got really sad.
"She decided that from that point on, she'd care only for her granddaughter."
"Only her, and no one else."
Me?
- You.
Can I have some more?
- Sure.
Are you okay?
Wake up!
Say something!
Wake up!
Grandma!
Say something.
"What's the matter, darling?"
My present died.
- How come?
- She ate too much.
"She never had enough to eat, but there was too much here."
"I'm gonna give it back, but I need the ticket."
Where's the ticket?
It's my show -
This is the plan.
I'm docking you for being an asshole.
And I'm docking Gig for having people killed.
"And I'm docking Crystal for being a twisted, psycho bitch!"
"Starting today, i decide where the money goes."
"If anyone doesn't like it, we're all going to jail."
- [ Gasps ]
- You give me that ticket.
Where is it?
Where is the ticket?
I..
I gave it to Larry King.
"Uh, no..."
Got to learn to share your toys!
[Dan] The search is over.
The winneroflast month's $6.4 million lottery jackpot... has finally stepped forward.
She's a waitress at a local Denny's right here in Harrisburg.
Pennsylvania's newest multimillionaire is Wendy Fawcett.
Thankyou so much!
I don't know what to say.
I've never won anything before in my life.
"[ Woman ] Wendy, what are you gonna do with the money?"
I'm going to put some in savings and some of it in checking.
And the rest I'll be sharing with a good friend.
- And who's that?
- I'm not telling you!
[ Cackling ]
"And we're giving a lot of it away to the Big Brothers, the Sunshiny Day Club, Asthma..."
- [Man] Do you have asthma?
I'm up.
I'm up.
She don't want to believe that the boy is using drugs... but he comes home every day with bloodshot eyes... and then he eats everything in the kitchen.
She knows he didn't get those red eyes... from being in the library.
I hear the boy can't even read.
"Good morning, Mr. Moses."
What do you think?
"You think this is something, check this out."
What do you think?
"Look, girls, y'all just gonna have to wait in line."
"Mr. Moses, let's make a trade."
I'll trade you The Best of Wynton Marsalis... for Duke Ellington and Billie Holiday.
Never!
I would never give up any of my records for anything.
It would be like cutting off one of my hands.
"Jeff, you're right."
"Got to go younger, huh?"
Yeah.
I'm getting me girls on Soul Train.
"Have a good day, Mr. Moses."
"- Good morning, Mrs. Walker."
"- Morning, Jeff."
Thanks again for the tickets tonight for that show.
No... thank you.
When the Georgetown Three make it big...
"I'm going to say, ""Special thanks to Mrs. Walker..."
"""who let me slide on my rent when I didn't have it."
"""This Grammy's for you."""
Have a good day.
"Hey, Jeff, ready for tonight?"
You know I am.
First show's sold out.
It's complicated.
Can you trust her?
Yes.
Absolutely.
"And you can, too."
But you can't trust me with the truth?
"Oh, hang on."
"Alexis, that's not about trust."
I am your father.
"And from the day you came into this world, it's been my job to protect you."
[Sighs]
"So, what's our next move?"
There is no next move.
We let sleeping dogs lie.
"It's safer that way, for everyone."
"I'm really sorry to interrupt, but I think I found something."
- On Phillip's homicide?
- Yeah.
"I was going through Jordan Keegan's computer files, and I found something interesting."
It's a screenplay.
Mm.
"""Gemini Killers."""
"Yeah, it's a dreadful story about a serial-killing duo."
"Not sure, but it might give us some insight."
I've seen this before.
The script?
"No, the..."
the notes in the margins here...
This odd handwriting that...
I know who the killer is.
"No, I cannot hold."
I...
- Look where i'm pointing.
- 90 seconds!
90 seconds?
"Wait, no!"
I don't have a script.
"Excuse me, I never got a script."
There is no script.
This is the lottery.
"For the love of god, f there was script, we'd all be rich."
Amateurs.
"Captain, Lieutenant."
How's the investigation going?
"Well, we're just getting started."
"Spoke to the staff, the camera crew."
Everybody said they left the building after the show.
They usually do.
"Well, somebody was here."
The girl didn't stab herself.
You wanted to know if Marissa received any fan mail.
Some of them are pretty dicey.
"You know, personal."
I put them on top.
"I need quiet, everyone!"
New girl.
"New girl, you're on in five, four, three, two, and you're on."
Good evening... people.
Welcome to the big gold rush pick 6.
I'm Natalie Teeger.
Are you ready to play?
Then let's play... the lottery.
And the first number is...
Turn it on!
"Clutched his halo and held it straight, didn't he!"
How do you know all that?
I know everything you do and think.
Dr. Jekyll wouldn't tell you.
He ain't the kind of...
"And as you were leaving the room, you turned at the door, didn't you?"
"And you said, ""For a moment, I thought..."""
What did you think?
What did you think?
Did you think Dr. Jekyll was falling in love with you?
"You, with your cheap little dreams?"
"Or did you think, perhaps that in him, you saw a bit of me, Hyde?"
"Oh, but it confuses you, doesn't it?"
"It isn't quite clear, is it?"
Oh...
What are you going to do?
Something so simple.
I'm going to put an end to all that confusion.
"Please, sir!"
"Oh, no!"
"Please, no!"
"Yes, dance."
Dance and dream.
Dream that you're Mrs. Henry Jekyll of Harley Street dancing with your own butler and six footmen.
Dream they've all turned into white mice and crawled into an eternal pumpkin.
"Here, you in there!"
Open this here door!
Police!
- Ivy!
- I'm going in.
Governor!
"Ho, there!"
I love you very much.
"Good morning, sir."
"John, what do you think of the president's proposal?"
I don't know.
"It's good to have less enemies, I guess."
You're a military man.
You don't think he's putting us at risk?
That's a little above my pay grade.
If you feel that way why didn't you run against him?
"- No, no, no."
That's one job I never wanted.
I like my office.
I like my constituents.
I like being a thorn in the side of the administration.
But I think voters today want somebody cool.
"Oh, come on, Mr. Speaker, I think you're pretty cool."
He went to bed at 8 and watched...
The president has a call scheduled with the speaker at 9:30.
"- I should be there for that, shouldn't I?"
- No.
You have to be here in case of a deadlock...
"Hey, I'm gonna see you later."
-
-With the red tie for that.
- Jenna?
"- Absolutely, Mr. Vice President."
Red tie's the way to go.
Jenna.
Jenna.
Did you get me in?
- What do I get if I did?
- What do you want?
He was starving...
Yoyo!
He has a fever and his stomach ached.
Yoyo!
Where was I just now?
You were getting nowhere.
Because I don't know what you're talking about.
You still remember the good old days?
"""l remembered the love song she used to sing."""
"""Even in my dreams I will always remember."""
"""Her tender love warms my heart."""
"""The good old days I will always remember."""
"""Like a flower that bears fruit is our love."""
"""l cannot live without you."""
"""The calm water rippled as you left me!"""
"""Our love will never be forgotten."""
You know how I suffered these 3 years?
But I have my own difficulties.
Difficulties?
Why did you get engaged to Fat Pig?
It's all because of you.
Me?
You shouldn't marry Fat Pig.
You should marry me.
"Sooner or later, you'll know how much I love you."
Love?
Action speaks louder than words.
Can you wait?
Did you make it?
"If you didn't come, I would have made it."
What?
I meant the 'Beast'.
Shizuru!
What?
Has something happened lately?
Eh?
"No, nothing."
"Yeah, but you are acting a little weird."
And so!
"Because our class has not been on the ball lately, the teacher chose a new motto for our class!"
What do you think it is?
Sis!
Eh?
What do you think?
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
Man...
You just don't listen to what anyone else says!
I'm sorry!
Say it again!
I don't want to!
Please!
I will listen this time!
Please!
What I was saying was...
My class has not been doing well so my teacher choose the motto Everyone has kibi kibi kibi-dango!
Sis has been acting like that for a long time.
G-Grampy?
You are acting like you are in a haze.
"What, did you get some of that Katsuragi-kid's smoke?"
"I admire her desire to search for anwsers, but the thing she wants to know about is so vast and vague, that she is struggling."
She is like a small bird caught in a net.
A net?
It is a trifling thing gor someone like you who can see those things.
"I'm not in trouble, Carl, you are."
Please tell them they're wrong.
Did you kill Lawrence Ridgeway?
I'm sorry.
No.
You shot him?
It's my job to look out for you.
To look out for this family.
People depend on me.
"When they told me about the rifle,"
I thought... but I didn't want to believe it was you.
Ridgeway told me about the account.
"If that money disappeared, and they came asking, he would have pointed to me."
He was a loose end.
I had to protect us.
And why not blackmail the Secretary of the Navy while you're at it.
That was nothing ;
it was an empty threat.
It was a diversion.
Man is still dead.
"But that AUTEC money is just sitting there, and we're about to lose everything."
I did this for both of us.
"We needed it, Phillip."
Didn't we?
Didn't we?
"Oh, no."
"Vance nails you with the shredding detail, huh?"
"Yes, from redacted to unredacted to recycling to..."
"Tell me, I have a question."
Hmm?
Do you believe?
Believe in what?
"""Come to me..."""
"""The day is about to come to an end..."""
"""My heart belongs to you, my friend."""
"""It is used to your company."""
"""I am a moon and you are a star."""
"""Come to me..."""

"""Come to me..."""
"""This is the limit of love."
"It has started testing me."""
"""My love has started to cross all limits."""
"""My restless heartbeat pleads you."""

"""My only job is to love you."""
"""My idleness has started serving a purpose."""
"""On top of that, even the weather is lovely..."""
"""Come to me..."""
"""Come to me, my love..."""
"""Come to me..."""
"""I've been in love before."""
"""But with you it's different."""
"""This bond that we share."""
"""Is the journey of this life."""
"""Or do we share an old connection?"""
"""Come to me..."""
"""Come to me..."""
How rude!
Even I am not used to people not turning around to look at me.
Using my pickup line on me?
- Yes.
- Liquor baron Zakir Merchant.
Awesome.
"Okay, Tony."
I never should have doubted you.
"Well, you didn't."
You're helping me.
"No, I-I mean before-- when you said... this guy was suspicious."
I just thought I knew him.
I still don't know why.
Grab his arm.
What?
"Yeah, just don't touch his skin."
Oh.
Perfect.
Bandage?
Right here.
Okay...
I can't get over your... speed.
"You used to spend months researching, analyzing, planning-- now you just... go."
"Jake, I'm still the same person."
The same person having a conversation over a dead body.
"You guys know I'm still here, right?"
Any luck on those prints?
"Uh, yeah."
"We got one, McGee."
Sending it straight to Abby.
Is that what I think it is?
Low-tech but effective.
Who's lead officer on this wing?
Uh...
"I'm real sorry, Lieutenant."
I don't know how we missed that.
"Well, the good news is, there are other cameras pointed in this direction-- we just have to look at that footage."
Restrooms stay closed until we can an M.E. here.
"Erica, you were right to be upset."
Really?
Yeah.
"And also, to answer your question, when are you allowed to decide what we talk about?"
When you're ready.
"And apparently, that's now."
So...
Let's talk about Kai.
Ok.
"Ok, what's the catch?"
No catch.
Sit.
Please.
"Well, he... he is withdrawing from everything,"
And I feel like it's my fault.
Why?
Because you told him that you felt something for him?
"And he thinks that changes everything, and I told him it doesn't have to, but he--he doesn't listen."
"And you think that he's wrong-- that after your confession, that you can continue to be just friends."
Yes.
Because I made it very clear to him that--
That you were not breaking up with Ethan.
Right.
I know.
What?
It's funny.
"You know, a year ago, you and I couldn't have this conversation."
"You know, I would have shut it down and, uh, you would have dropped it."
You would've done as you were told.
Heh.
Yeah.
Things are different now.
It'd be better to say I was the subject.
Clara wanted to talk about me...
And boy she talked...
Did she say you were selfish?
That's what she always say.
If you think she's right..
-She's right about that.
I don't know exactly what selfish means.
Someone who loves himself more than others.
"Yeah, but that happens to everyone."
Some of them realizes and others don't.
Did she just say that?
No.
She talked more about...
I don't know!
I remember it was getting dark..
And I started crying.
I don't know if Clara noticed that.
Did you cry?
I've never seen you crying.
Clara talked and talked...
And she was making an image of me that I couldn't recognize.
Has this happened to you before?
Yes.
No.
That couldn't happen to you.
Why do you ask me then?
Clara said everything was over.
That it'd be better if we don't try it again.
That everything became an useless effort.
And what did you say?
I didn't speak much.
"Where are you getting cold, eh?"
-Mishanya!
- Leave me alone!
I awfully respect you.
Judge foryourself.
What makes a man happy during the war?
-What?
- Look.
"To stay awayfrom bullets, to have a good nap and a hearty meal."
-Yes.To receive a letter.
- That's true.
-Stepa!
-What?
-What do you think...
"- l'm not thinking now, I'm drinking tea."
-There is no happiness at war.
"- Nobody has asked foryour opinion, man."
You are too young.
I'm leaving in 30 minutes.Will you take a bath?
Then get ready.
"No, I'm not going to take a bath."
I'm no bloody Onegin.
What?
Can you tell me for sure when we are going out on a mission?
Does your ex-con soul long for some action?
You can not even kill a hen and you talk about missions.
I had no knife then.
"When I'm armed, I'll do anything."
-Stepa!
-What?
Could you demonstrate to him how prisoners are taken?
OK. I'll pretend to be a sentinel... and you'll attack me from behind.
A meeting?
We're isolated because of Han and Puyo's embargo.
And Puyo's preparing to attack us.
I want to ask Commander Jumong what he plans to do about this.
Call the Commander.
You can't talk to him now.
Why not?
"Is he really dead, like the people say?"
What are you talking about?
The Commander isn't dead.
Even Sosuhno has disappeared.
Yuntabal.
Tell us what's going on.
Where's the Commander?
I can't tell you.
I can't trust you until I meet him.
He's the one who failed to protect us against Puyo and the Han.
We'll take matters into our own hands.
Let's go.
I'll talk to Songyang before attacking Jolbon.
He'll want to avoid a war once he finds out Jumong is dead.
We'll be ready to attack as soon as you return.
?
?
Dante!
Dante!
I've gotta rest.
"I told you, you shouldn't have done that last hit, man."
You've been doing too much lately.
"You're not doing enough, friend."
I love the venom and the sweet venom loves me.
It's better to sell them than to eat them.
You're a degenerate.
All of Naples is degenerate.
Why did you bring me here?
So I can feel as degenerate as you?
We didn't start this war.
We don't sell our bodies for a pack of cigarettes.
A pack of cigarettes?
"Maam, what will you give me for that?"
Right.
With this and a pack of cigarretes I can get bread... for a large family.
Would you like some maam?
- Here
- Thank you.
- I brought you here because...
- Because everyone can be cruel.
- Are we even now?
- Yes.
- Do you need anything else from me?
"- No, no."
Jimmy?
What did I do to you?
It's not my fault if things didn't go well for you today.
"What's wrong with you, Jimmy?"
- Here.
- What's that?
Try it.
"Here, like this."
Are you crazy?
I already have hair.
Did you bring this filthy thing from the US?
"No, not at all."
"- It's better than the ""oy gevalt."""
The dark vault.
You've never seen the dark vault.
I'm gonna hazard a guess here you're never gonna want to see the dark vault after we move that to there.
"Okay, you get the..."
"No, you know what?"
Let's do this tomorrow.
"You know, we better secure it."
"You know, let's move that trunk."
"When I say ""let's,"" I mean you."
"Little known but apropos fact, by the way,"
"Steven Rubell, who was one of the co-founders of Studio 54, he considered calling his club Wonderland."
"Oh, my God!"
- Other side.
Other side.
"- Hey, lady!"
"Yeah, okay, let's go."
- My ten grand?
"- Right, about that."
"Well, Artie, you know, last-minute Apache helicopter rides to the middle of nowhere,"
"- South Dakota, don't come cheap."
- I know a guy with a Chinook.
Would have cost you about half if you would have called me!
"Well, I had to beat Alice here, didn't I?"
Did it work?
- Look who's here.
"- Oh, my God!"
"Yeah, making breakfast."
Come on.
"So, Myka, you said I was a good kisser."
NARRATOR:
Ok.
I'll have Sgt. Whitfield search the Zumwalt house for a similar hourglass.
It's Hotch.
Ellie Zumwalt is out of surgery and awake.
Thank you.
"We appreciate you talking to us, Mrs. Zumwalt."
We know this is a difficult time.
"My husband is dead, isn't he?"
"Yes, he is."
We're very sorry.
What about Josie?
Is my daughter all right?
We're hopeful.
That's why it's important that you tell us everything you can about what happened.
"I was asleep, and then there was a scream."
It was Josie.
"I woke up, but my eyes wouldn't open."
Josie kept screaming.
"And every time I went to where I thought she was, the scream came from somewhere else."
"We realize you couldn't see well, but could you make out any features about this man?"
No.
He--he wore something on his face.
"They were like, um,"
"I don't know, glasses."
Like eyeglasses?
"No, no."
Bigger than that.
"More like, um, like goggles."
That's all I could make out.
Did he speak?
Only at the end.
Eleven.
"Yeah, just, uh... just came in."
"Abby, check your in-box, please."
"Uh, I just sent you his I.D. photo."
Oh.
Great.
Facial comparison should get us somewhere.
"Michael Beers, 41, retired Marine."
Air marshal since 2010.
Lives up in Syracuse.
- Wife and two kids.
- I'm digging this guy's glasses.
"Those would be cute on you, Gibbs."
"I mean, not that squinting isn't totally super cute on you, too."
"I checked his accounts, boss-- he's got an open credit card at a motel about a mile from here."
Never checked out?
"Not yet, anyway."
"Well, okay, red flag city here."
"As much as these two look alike, the key markers-- it's definitely not a match."
"Well, who's that at the airport?"
I don't know.
"But whoever it is, it's not Air Marshal Mike Beers."
"All right, boss."
You got it;
we won't.
Won't what?
Why couldn't that be on speaker?
Gibbs doesn't want to alert the innocent bystanders that our friend over there is an imposter.
You were right.
You were right.
We were both right.
Then who is he?
Not a clue.
"""Hey, Jay Pharoah!"
"""Agh!"
"""You the best, nigga."
"You... are so amazing."""
"And I get sad, you know?"
"'Cause I see entertainers who I think deserve that type of notoriety, and they don't get it."
Like Trey Songz.
I think Trey Songz should be a lot bigger than he is.
You know what I mean?
"He's one of the only entertainers I know that can sit there, eye-molest your girlfriend, while you watch helplessly, and there's nothing you can do but be like,"
"""Yo, that's Trey Songz."
He's eye-molesting my woman.
"""I'm probably gonna sleep with her, and that's fucking awesome."""
"Matter of fact, give me a female volunteer out of the audience right now."
I'm gonna show you what he does.
You?
You wanna come up here?
"Come on, Karen, get up here."
Come on.
This way.
"Here, sit down."
You look happy as shit.
"""Hi, everybody!"""
"Okay, if you don't know who Trey Songz is, this is what he does, he be..."
"¶ Whoa, whoa, ah."
¶ Yeah.
¶ Look what the girl done did to me ¶
Ooh!
You're a little too into this shit.
"All right, it ain't that type of party, ma'am."
Thank you so much.
Peace.
You know that photo that you sent me?
I dug around and apparently Shou Saito took out a patent for a computer brain interface last year.
How are you real?
I don't...
"Okay, fuck."
I don't...
They brought you here!
"You are, you're real, and they brought you here, and they're trying to fuck with me."
"Nice try, good try."
I get it.
It's part of the test.
His patent got rejected outright.
"They said it was insane, it was dangerous."
Wow.
Really?
How much are they paying you?
Honestly.
Cos you're killing it right now.
- Have they given you something?
"- Sorry, I thought you were fake."
"But now I know you're real, I'm being a really terrible host."
I got some non-alcoholic wine.
Might put us in the mood.
"- Cooper, what I want to do is..."
- We'll talk about it in the kitchen.
- Cooper!
"- Sonja, relax, okay?"
Give it up.
"I know, the jig's up, okay?"
Let it go.
"Look, Cooper, there's more."
Five people have disappeared in the past year.

Revenge for when you and I...

I've been cooking the books for years.

- I was good at it.
You want to burn down my house?
I'm going to burn down yours.
A standard in-house Bastion contract.
It specifies a large amount of cash that you've been funneling into investments.
Cash obtained illegally.
You forged my signature.
Where do you think I learned that little trick?
Work with me.
Partners.
"Now, what do you really want?"
You want me?
You want Grace?
I want you both.
Suddenly single.
"Starting over, I guess."
Is that what we're doing?
I'm not gonna see you for a while.
We're going to Argentina.
"Simon, what's wrong?"
He's not sick.
"This is all bullshit, okay?"
"Don't ever go back to the department, Colt!"
They'll use you up and hang you out to dry on Christmas!
You'll wind up sitting there with your freezing family waiting for the phone to ring!
"Don't worry, Dad."
They'll call you.
That's right.
And it'll be Bob Pogo on his hands and knees begging you to come back.
There's no reason for us to be worried.
Everything's gonna be fine.

I liked him better when he yelled at us.
God.
"Oh, God."
Why did he buy that damn TV?
No.
- A retarded woman in her thirties.
I didn't notice she was retarded so we went back to her parents' place.
I overlooked certain telltale signs.
"""It's okay with my mum and dad."" The Bambi poster in her room."
"Anyway, don't tell anyone."
People have a hard time with it.
And sex!
Imagine the uproar.
"I didn't know, and the sex was fine."
- The sex was fine?
Very interesting.
"- Her boobs weren't retarded, okay?"
I prefer a retard with good boobs over a bright girl with stupid boobs.
That's where you eat and sing and read and so on.
"- Nice, isn't?"
- Indeed.
WELCOME BODIL
"The room needs to be furnished, but..."
Look.
Your idea?
Super.
What a nice... square room.
I'd like a moment alone with Bodil.

- Yes.
- I painted it.
- Isn't that nice?
- I painted it with my mouth.
- You painted that with your mouth?

She is almost as beautiful as my mother.
You could have telegraphed.
It was easier to take the train.
"On what platform you fell, a small mine?"
She was a woman betrothed to a gangster.
I spent the night with her.
I do not know where now.
And here I am.
- Have you seen the Eiffel Tower?
- I lost your luggage.
"The portrait of my mother, the last letter of my father,"
"I have his tie, handkerchief ..."
I don't know where ...
"""I loved,"" is not the truth."
You touched me.
Emotions ...
I do think about your father.
Beautiful was your father.
"It always falls before the beauty, especially if you do not bend."
What is the truth?
Wash whiter?
"My shirt the trip, the night."
The rain ...
Do you do this to cause idiocy?
I provoke the imbecility ...
The im-be-cyl-li-ta!
And when your mother came to Paris for the last time I ...
That was the only thing that I could do.
I hoped days like that would arrive and continue on forever.
"So, I wasted away that young life."
It was a regrettable ending.
And so...
"You are saying that the grudge that the woman had possessed the cat, and turned it into a Bake Neko?"

Which means that woman's grudge is beyond redemption.
It is your turn to talk!
Your turn!
Who are you referring to?
I only did what I was told.
It's not my fault!
It's not my fault!
I was just used by you!
I was just following orders!

Sato-san!
Otherwise it's impossible.
I won't use it.
You can trust me.
Would you trust someone like you?
You have my word.
Can he sleep at night?
Your partner.
I remembered.
He was in the Social-Political Brigade.
"You know, Franco's Gestapo."
He killed a girl at a protest in Vallecas in '71.
Shot her twice.
He's aged badly.
And I'm glad.
Hello.
How are you?
That's Marina.
She and my daughters were close friends.
Quini took her to the hunting lodge the other day.
"After they were together he asked her not to get dressed, and he tied her to the bed."
Then he left the room and came back with another man.
Who was he?
She didn't see his face.
"All she knows is he smelled good, like expensive cologne."
And that he had very soft hands.
He took photographs of her.
"Quini threatened to show them to everyone in town, if she told anyone."
The night my daughters were killed...
"Marina was with Quini, but not the whole night."
Do you think she'd be able to tell a judge?
She couldn't even tell you.
I have to go.
Who's here to avoid it?
Step this way!
Aren't you...?
I have the safest way for you to avoid it!
"If I knew it could be avoided, I'd do it too."
It's already my 8th child!
"Better late than never, why not start now!"
Please come with me!
What a bunch of fools!
You couldn't even get those 2 jerks.
How can you be the Commissioner of Police?
How can you be the Sick Man of Asia?
"Your Excellency, cool down!"
I know the place of exchange:
Cafe Casablanca.
- You recognize me?
- No!
Really?
I don't know your kind of person!
Lucky me!
"I'm not in a good mood, just get lost!"
You think you can get away by not looking at me.
"You can tell from my voice I'm the Commissioner, scram!"
Upstart.
Nearly wouldn't give up his place!
Has Yoyo been today?
Damn...
Canton was defeated!
"""Long live China and our great national heroes."""
"""Long live China and our dauntless armies."""
"""Brothers never give in!"""
"""Yet yourselves ready, brothers, to fight on the front line!"""
No!
"I need to stretch their wings, then, bye."
Interesting.
Do something because they will not stop.
"Relax, I know exactly how to get attention of our benefactors aliens."
"Relax, breathe deeply, take a deep breath."
-Loving.
-I am the mayor of the village!
"In this place, I say!"
-This is great.
Can you believe that.
"If you have a Will, has one output."
"Bill, are you?"
"I know not, Uncle Mano ... are noisy and are destroying our ice."
"Atticus, are building a way out of here."
All they thought never would leave here.
"Look, our road to freedom."
"It will not long, boys."
I will miss you here.
Where we live when everyone leaves?
"We'll find a new place dear, the world is big."
And just being together which is already a home.
It is.
Let children to hide.
"Carmen, you see ... even in the mystical should be a couple."
"No, no, no!"
-Are you still here.
-And you're still here.
-They were.
What?
A little while bad they disappear.
Who's missing?
You have to tell the truth.
"If Gene died from something he bought here, you are responsible."
Are you selling drugs?
No!
And we are done here.
You said you could help me.
You call this help?
She's practically accusing me of murder.
We're just trying to get to the bottom of this.
She's just the same as all the other mundanes.
They see the way we dress and they think we're freaks.
She's really just trying to help.
"It's okay, Coreen, I see who you're siding with -your minimum wage paycheck."
I thought you knew me.
I thought you understood the dark beauty of what I'm trying to create here.
I do!
Lexia!
"Hey, Coreen."
You came into this with an attitude about my friend and me and our lifestyle.
You were never looking to help her.
That is not true!
"Oh come on, think about it, Vicki, you can't ever trust anyone, can you?"
"Hey, excuse me, excuse me."
Oh my god!
Eew!
Yuck!
Eew!
Get off him!
911?
"Yeah, we need an ambulance to the Underground Club."
It's at Queen West and Crawford.
Thank you.
"Precisely, as he has no memory, he says nothing."
It's better.
"Go, now."
I have to open my shop at 9 am.
Let's go!
Go and have the stew from last night warmed up.
It will be better when we have the new Mexican paper.
Eh?
"No, nothing."
"Montparnasse, quick!"
"Yes, sir."
Good morning.
"Hello, Elizabeth."
"Come, I've already ordered."
I read your article yesterday.
"If my brother is alive, can I see him?"
I never wrote he was alive.
I just assumed he was.
"In fact, I worked deductively."
"At last, he's alive or not?"
"In reality, since last night, I'm... sure he is dead."
I even have proof.
I found this medallion in the sewers that serve the courthouse.
It's horrible.
Is it the medallion he always carried with him?
Yes.
I gave it to him.
"It is the effigy of St. Jacques, his patron saint."
I brought it back from a pilgrimage to Compostela.
Why weren't you more clear in your article?
You are right.
I should've speak to you before writing it.
How much do we have to take from this crud?
There'll be no vigilante stuff.
Not while I'm barracks chief.
"Hey, look at them!"
- Those crazy jerks!
- They won't get away with it!
The Krauts'll shoot them!
It's Harry and the Animal!
They're trying to sneak into the Russian compound!
They're past the 50-yard line.
- It's a quarterback sneak.
-Look at them go!
Those idiots will paint themselves right into their graves.
Get a load of them
"Hello, bublichki."
How are you all?
Hey!
"Hey, the brick Kremlin!"
"Hey, Olga Volga, wait for me."
"Hey, Animal."
The window.
Hmm.
So life sort of drifted back to normal in Stalag 17.
It was a couple of days before Christmas and everything seemed quiet enough.
"But underneath it all, we knew we were sitting on a barrel of dynamite and that the stoolie, whoever he was, was ready to strike again at any second."
At ease.
At ease.
At ease.
"All right, at ease."
At ease.
Mail call!
"- All right, at ease."
I was right.
Only $ 100...
I'm short of money right now.
I've been out of work...so just give me a little time.
"You understand, don't you?"
"You've got balls, young man!"
How come I never heard of you before?
You've got a lot of guts.
I'll find you some work for good money.
"No hard feelings, right?"
"If I can help you, let me know."
You've done well for yourself.
Enjoy the festa!
"Oh, this is too violent for me!"
What've you got there?
"Michael, your father loves you very much."
"Mr. Cicci, from the year 1942 to the present time, you were an employee of the Genco Olive Oil Company?"
That's right.
But in actuality you were a member of the Corleone crime organization.
"No, we called it the Corleone family, Senator."
What was your position?
"At first, like everybody else, I was a soldier."
-What is that?
"-A button, you know, Senator."
"No, I don't know."
Tell me.
"When the boss says ""push a button"" on a guy, I push a button."
"See, Senator?"
Mr. Questadt.
-You mean you kill people?
-What?
You kill people at the behest of your superiors.
Carlos:
This place is starting to look like a dump.
- Why don't you take some boxes away?
"- Okay, boss."
Don't call me that.
Wow!
Where do you guys get this from?
It's beautiful.
"You know that can of paint up front, the white one?"
Yes.
Why don't you go get it and paint over that shit?
Everybody gonna like this.
It gives some cultural stuff to the store and the kids love that.
I drew that.
Eight years ago.
My mom used to watch me every afternoon.
"Altogether, it took about... a month."
Why you want to take it down?
- 'Cause it's bullshit.
- It's beautiful.
"You said your mom liked it, I'm sure your dad--"
Why don't you cover that shit?
You put a part of yourself into the store--
What are you...?
"I did that shit for my father, he covered that shit and now you want to uncover it?"
"When I come back, this shit better be gone."
Stop!
- Yo!
"Ten cuidado, coño."
- Watch where you're going.
"Right, right."
Okay.
"- Pawnshop, and it's awesome."
- Who are you again?
- I'm Bo.
L.m a.
- Private investigator.
- Right.
You've gotten mixed up with dangerous people.
- Like the mob?
- Sort of.
"Jenny, Olivia put a hit on you."
That's why Samir's been so distant.
He was protecting me.
Maybe he was leading you on.
Getting a piece of tail on the side while mouthing promises about leaving his wife.
Then he gets bored and just bails without even a goodbye.
Or whatever.
"I'm sure he cared about you, Jenny."
I can tell him to handle Olivia before somebody gets killed.
"Now get some rest, okay?"
Tell her what she's dealing with.
It's not fair.
No.
"I start talking about that stuff, Fae get mad at me and things start sucking."
"This is our life now, Kenzi."
We have to protect it.
This is how you want to play this game?
What a maverick.
Guess what.
I got 10 cops a week who pull this stunt in here.
"The tougher you guys act, the more I can see through you."
"Dyson, it's okay to ask for help."
Stab in the dark here.
I saw you at the station and your picture later on such a beautiful boy.
"I thought I've got to have him, even if it kills me."
I like your spiel nobody's ever told me that before.
Spieling is my profession.
I kept lobbying with Christine...
and hoping that you would come.
"I like you going for me, Gerard."
"I, dirty old man."
loving HUSBANDS OF christine HALSLAG
- My God!
"- Hey, what's up?"
Three dead!
Look at those urns!
I'll be damned!
Chrissy's family grave.
She had all three of them cremated.
A fourth and they can play bridge.
- Did you know they were dead?
- Of course.
"The whole town knows, and even pities her."
Pities her?
"She let them die, and I know how!"
"- Oh, come off it!"
- She had one crash with a parachute.
She fed one to the lions and sank the other at sea.
Bet she didn't tell you!
Bullshit!
One of them had to show off in the Safari Park the second one's parachute didn't open and the third...
And who'll be the fourth?
!
- Get your hands off me!
- You or me!
Things are crazy at work.
Because of this case.
Remember what I told you before?
What?
How the Jap raped a woman?
What about it?
You filthy slut.
That woman.
It was her.
What the hell are you talking about?
That woman he raped- it's the same woman whose house burned down.
"She went crazy after that, and used to run around naked at night."
My wife saw her at the public bathhouse.
"She was totally covered in rashes and boils,"
Mumbling gibberish the whole time.
Are you out of your mind?
Byeong-gyu's got to stop this.
Talking crap to his dimwitted buddies.
You worthless bastard.
It was your theory.
I was just messing with you.
Who in their right mind would believe crap like that?
"No, I think you're right."
It can't be the mushrooms.
That doesn't make sense.
Gimme a break.
What are you looking at?
Get outta here!
What?
Ignore her.
She's been doing that all morning.
What a nutjob.
Say it again in Japanese if you dare
Say it again!
- Get out of my way!
- I dare you!
"Come on, guys!"
Faster!
Tado!
"Baso, kill him!"
I'm holding down his feet!
Beat him up!
I'm holding down his feet again!
Stop!
All of you!
What is it?
What the hell?
Let me cut off this pig head of yours!
Stop!
Stop!
Yoshi...
Yoshimura
You're in big trouble
You have the nerve to beat me up
Let's kill him!
Shut your mouth!
Excuse us!
Let us through!
I'll kill all you Mehebu clansmen
I'll kill you all
"Let's do it, Father, before the Japanese kill us all"
Why the hell did you provoke him when you knew he'd kill us all?
You're nothing but a bunch of hounds that can only chase and hunt and know nothing of self-restraint
How much longer do I have to put up with you?
"Alright, we'll find her a spot with a good view so that she can watch her daddy throw up."
"I'll take her, Jake."
Yeah?
"Thanks, Peyton."
Glad to.
"Alright, gather around."
Where's Nathan?
"Tim, you're his girlfriend, where is he?"
"I don't know, coach."
He was at school today.
Alright.
I've got some offensive sets worked out here.
Line up at the low stacks.
So I had an idea.
Okay.
Remember when I read that Steinberg book?
Steinbeck.
"Yeah, that guy."
And then you did something that I wanted.
"Oh yeah, yeah."
"Getting drunk, tattooed and grounded?"
But in a fun way.
I'm thinking we should try that again.
"Okay, you might want to run that by Keith first."
"Not exactly that, I just, I want to know everything about you."
And I want you to know... almost everything about me.
"- What's going on, Brooke?"
- Nothing.
I just...
"I want to know you better, Luke."
"So how about, the next time you do something you love, you bring me along, and then we trade."
Are you busy after practice tomorrow?
"Baby,I'm sorry."
"Oh,my God!"
Happy birthday.
"This is like some kind of,like,nightmare or something."
Happy birthday.
"No,happy birthday."
No.
You know what?
"Forget it,man."
Hit the road.
"No,no,no,we suld,like,celebrate or something."
No.
I'm in the middle of a gig here.
Okay?
That's right.
Gigging right now.
Bella!
Bella!
Really?
You are gonna hitch your hope wagon to Johnny Tearducts?
There are higher forces at work here.
I'm just trying to avoid dying alone.
He wasn't a bad guy.
So he's a little passionate.
Whatever.
Didn't he try to suck your blood?
Drink my blood.
Like in a nice way.
I was just going to check out his show and see what happens.
I'm going to tell you exactly what's going to happen.
"You're going to go; he's going to sing a couple songs about rainbows,get a little misty and then you're going to be right back here telling me how you're afraid that your lady parts have closed up."
Oh!
She used to get so mad at me every time I'd talk about you.
She thought I had a secret crush on you.
Maybe she was right.
- Do you want to have dinner with me?
- What?
"Well, I'm asking you if you want to have dinner with me."
I...
I have to...
I have to think about it.
I'll have to ask Claire.
- All right.
- Okay.
"""D""!"
Congratulations!
You're improving!
I still don't understand what you're saying about twin primes.
- I'm explaining it to you!
- But I still don't understand.
Don't you know that it's possible to remove an infinite number of elements from an infinite set and still HAVE an infinite number of elements left over?
We spent quite a bit of time on this already!
My... my wife understood this on our first date!
Class dismissed!
Get out of here!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Very enjoyable dinner.
- Did you cook it yourself?
"- Yes, I did."
- What a liar.
"- Yes, I am."
What?
I have an infarct.
-An infarct?
-A ass infarct.
-A ass infarct?
-You are really vulgar.
It is an infarct ass.
-Its a joke.
You do not get upset.
"-No, clear that no."
If it passes a ass not it I can watch?
"We go, you make the peace."
-I do not want.
-It is truth what they say?
-What?
That you have chosen Medicine to study the birds.
Then it had to make Veterinary medicine?
no?
"Not them birds, ""love birds"","
Those that flies around the asses.
It is a old fashioned joke.
"We go, boys."
Prof. Cicchirini he is on the verge of arriving.
"You hear, you who you know everything to it, I can bathe if I have diarrhoea?"
"Yes, if you have much."
"We go, it is behind schedule."
I always have much.
"Italy, Italia."
"Land of saints, poets, navigators."
"You goes, never had said it to me."
"Good, I first do not try to be."
"You hear, Moroni, you cannot be here, if you sees Prof. him Ciotti, trouble is armed."
"It does not matter to me, I assume the risk."
You think?
That's it.
Pull over.
"You know, Phil, I wanted to support you on this."
"I'm a firm believer in livestock in the home, but you are out of control."
"No, I'm in control..."
More than ever.
"And if me getting what I want inconveniences people a little, then so be it."
Oh.
"Uh, she's nervous."
The guy said you should let her suck on your hair.
"Okay, that is it."
I am done.
♪ Enough of this ridiculousness ♪
"And thank you, Phil, for making me appreciate Mitchell."
"He may have his faults, but at least he's not a crazy person."
"Phil, honey."
"Yes, Claire."
I got an alpaca...
Again.
And there's nothing you can say about it.
I'm not saying anything.
What's the problem?
"Mom, dad!"
There is a camel in the living room!
It's not a c...
- I-I just can't.
- Okay.
I see you've all met Jolene two.
"Sadly, the original Jolene that your mother made me return was cruelly adopted by a children's hospital."
"You see, something hit me this morning when that truck didn't hit me this morning..."
I have not been in control of my own life.
"Oh, you want to play some more."
"Well, bring it on."
"Oh, we're playing dirty, huh?"
"Hmm, looks like we've got a music lover here."
Reinforcements!
"All right, soldiers."
Looks like it's on us to save the day.
"Luckily, I've got a plan."
"Eska, Desna, listen to me."
You've got to help us stop Unalaq.
"I know he's your father, but Vaatu has made him completely crazy."
We will never turn on our father.
"Please, if you let me out now,"
I can still stop him from destroying everything.
"Once he fuses with Vaatu, no one will be safe."
"Desna, he won't be your father anymore."
You don't know what you're talking about.
Our father is the wisest man in the world.
"If he says what he is doing is right,"
I believe him.
Huh?
"You know, if I wanted some ball of evil lurking over my shoulder all the time,"
I'd have stayed home with my mother-in-law.
"All right, spirit army, your general is here."
Follow me!
It's working.
It's not working.
Get me out of here!
Whoo-hoo!
Aah!
"All right, guys."
Rescue time.
"By the way, do you have any papers?"
No.
Lock him up.
Your information proved to be correct.
The man had very considerable assets.
This is enough money for your fare.
This is a passport to America.
You are now a French citizen.
The man you caught will never know about this?
You mean your brother?
He will never know.
Did anything happen to him?
He resisted my men.
He died.
He died?
Yes.
It was one of those unfortunate things.
Your first look?
"Yes, I had only seen pictures before."
It's a big country.
Millions of people beyond those buildings.
"All of them needing something, buying something."
And what do you sell them?
Oil.
"Oh, oil."
Are you an honest man?
What kind of a question is that?
I don't see anything wrong with the question.
Did you make your way honestly?
Of course I did.
Isn't that the only way?
Is it?
How come you're having a party on Saturday if it was two weeks ago?
"Christine was out of town, we couldn't get it together"
- and it worked out this Saturday.
- Why even have it all?
"Why not just forget it, wait till next year?"
- You blew it.
"- Yeah, I know."
"I wish we could've done it last week, but we couldn't get it together."
You should bring Cheryl.
It'll be fun.
Kind of reminds me a little of like President's Day.
It's not really the President's birthday.
It's some other day.
What am I doing?
You know...
Right.
We're back.
Let's start at the top of the scene.
It's a total scam.
He introduced her as a model.
She's like completely bullshitting this guy 'cause he's blind.
- By the way...
- Yeah.
Thank you for coming to meet Kim.
I might've mentioned Kenny.
He's old my friend in New York.
She just moved out here from the city.
"This is his first daughter, and she calls me like Uncle Richard."
- I've known her since she was born.
- Really?
"That's fun, ""Uncle Richard."""
"Yeah, but the problem is she's an actress, a singer, talented but she wants to get her breasts enlarged, and it's gonna drive Kenny crazy..."
Gulp it down quick.
Then you won't taste it.
I know.
"You want your daddy to give it to you, don't you?"
Daddy will give you the medicine.
Give it to me.
There.
"Be a nice girl, now."
Or you'll never be strong and big like Daddy.
"If Daddy took a spoonful first himself, Baby might do a patty-cake for him."
This is delicious.
This is...
All for a nice little elephant girl.
This is lovely.
You ain't so stupid as you look.
That's better.
"Annie, don't ever worry me like that again."
"There you are, you two."
I've got letters for both of you.
There.
Sgt. MacChesney and Sgt. Archibald Cutter.
Look what it says here.
"""Miss Emaline Stebbins requests the pleasure..."
"""of Sgt. Archibald Cutter's company at a""..."
What's that?
"""...betrothal dance preceding her marriage to Sgt. Thomas Ballantine."
"""8:00 p.m. Friday."" That's tonight."
"I worried so about you, dear, while you were away."
Perfectly awful things must have happened at Tantrapur.
It was rather touch and go there for a bit.
- You haven't told me yet about it yourself.
"- No, I haven't, have I?"
I mean television...
- What's all this?
"First of all, I think this place is great."
Really?
- Really.
"- Yeah, I think so too."
I mean it's exotic.
Right?
For example what's been done with money.
Pretty funny.
"- It's a hole in the wall, but it's alive."
- Perhaps it's best if Mr. Harmann and I sit down and consider what to do next.
"Coincidentally, my name is Harmann too."
"Yes, but coincidentally, she doesn't mean you."
"Alright then, good luck with that."
I'll be in my office.
"If anyone wants a coffee or something, just let me know."
Thanks.
Shit.
"I'm an idiot, I could be doing something completely different."
Like what?
Like earning money for instance.
Instead I'm sitting here in this shitty hotel with it's shitty rooms.
It's not shitty here.
You're beautiful.
Shut up!
I hope you like your new room and that you would recommend us to others.
We will do our best to ensure...
That's alright Tom.
- ... so that your stay is as pleasant as possible.
Yes I...
What should I say now?
The cafeteria's right this way.
They know me there.
I'll get us a good table.
- You would do that for me?
"- Oh, yeah."
"I'm very tight with Bertha, the lunchroom lady."
"Yeah, I once rescued a dolphin from her hair net."
"OK, maybe it'll last a few years."
"Yes, I'm acting principal now, and the pressures would be daunting for a man half my age."
Fortunately I have a vitality that belies my years.
I'm the only one who doesn't know how it's done.
"Listen, I think I found something that kind of works."
- What?
- This.
"Hi, Shawn."
- Wow.
From across the hall.
"- Yep, I got a 30-foot range."
"- What, you just jerk your head?"
- Watch again.
"I'm still young enough, I can do this twice in a row."
"Shawn, it's so strange."
I was just thinking about you.
And that's without conditioner.
"Cory, what is it?"
"- You were just drawn to me, weren't you?"
"- No, I thought you had head lice."
- Are you all right?
"- Yeah, I'm great."
"- Oh, good."
"- Hi, Topanga."
I was just thinking about you.
"James is going to want your attention, too, with his reading."
I'll have him work on it.
You promise.
"Promise me, I mean it."
"They have children, as he is alive."
Children?
You see them years beyond their union?
Yes.
Use this to save yourself.
Tell henry you've had a change of heart.
That you won't stand in the way of their union.
This has gone so far beyond me standing in the way of anything.
I am convicted of adultery!
Of treason!
Mary is with sebastian.
And my son francis...
Has returned to court.
You are brave to come to me with this.
"Because if I can't convince mary to wed francis,"
"If I can't undo your mistakes, I will lose my head."
But not before I watch you burned to death.
I promise you that.
Catherine:
Francis!
Mother.
"Ah, it's true!"
You're back!
"Oh, thank god."
They tell me father's out hunting pheasant
Beyond the south keep.
"I'm going to find him,"
"Get him to see reason,"
"[Man on TV] Oh, that can't be goo for his lower back!"
"Human Baboon, you stinker!"
Stop your evil ways.
[Thwacking]
"Oh, no, you don't."
"[Arthur] Tick, help!"
Egad!
My cold has escalated into double vision.
I'm the real Arthur.
He's a clone.
I Arthur.
What matter of rare quandary is this?
How can I be sure which Arthur is the real Arthur.
[Starts to sneeze]
Look!
"Tick, look!"
He's turning into a monster!
Monster?
Where?
Can't see anything wrong with him.
"Um, Arthur?"
"[Sighs] If you two don't stop this roughhousing, somebody's gonna get hurt and end up crying."
I know how I can prove I'm the real Arthur.
I'll tell you something only you and I would know.
"Go ahead, Arthur-like person."
"Oh, uh..."
OK.
"Remember that time my sister gave me that V-neck sweater vest for my birthday and we tried to return it to the store and they'd only give me credit, and I was so upset, and then at lunch they put onions on my cheeseburger,"
after I expressly asked the waitress not to?
"Do you remember that day, Tick?"
Oh.
Indeed I do.
Next!
"This is Choi Duk-soon, the wife of one Hwang Man-keun of Willowville."
What is her crime?
"Well, if I should explain..."
You slut!
"Your husband is alive and well, and you bump bellies with another man?"
How could you!
Don't just stand there!
Get her husband out of here!
Let go of me!
Let go!
"Hang them, Magistrate!"
They both deserve to be hanged!
"Sir, what should I do?"
Do whatever you want!
You can punish her according to the law or hang her like her husband said!
"Pardon, sir?"
Hustle!
You'll never catch up to the barbarians at this pace!
The Six Camps is no longer the front.
And the front is where warriors belong.
Why am I here like a pathetic fool?
Here you go.
Enjoy your food!
Rice cakes?
"Yes, it's a special treat for our grand opening!"
"Good luck with the business, Innkeeper."
Thank you!
"Wow, something smells good!"
When did this place open up?
I can go for a drink right now.
Why don't we stop in?
- What happened to Tino Zapatti?
"- He's dead, isn't he?"
I'm talking about 2 years ago.
He got probation.
What sentence did you recommend?
Ten to twenty.
I saw the rap sheet.
Tino was pushing drugs to kids.
"Not doing it himself, but having kids deal for him."
Weapon from a previous homicide?
Disappeared in the second report.
Who ordered it?
That I don't know.
Why didn't you ask?
Sudden urge to move to the country.
I forgot about it.
Now if you'll excuse me you'd better get out of here.
My lumbago tells me that snow is coming.
You better hurry.
Buffalo gets socked in pretty fast.
Thank you for your time.
Watch your step.
It's slippery.
Thank you.
- How long?
- About an hour.
You don't want to suffocate in a tunnel.
They got to dig one out ahead.
"Meanwhile, enjoy the snow."
We can't eat snow.
- Try that diner over there.
- Any good?
- Indeed.
Magnificent.
I've never liked the smell of books.
"The dust, perhaps."
I hear you have great plans for the walnut grove.
I shall have it knocked down to make place for a Grecian temple.
That does sound interesting.
Would you show me the site?
"Too expensive, and we do not need four bedrooms."
We can share.
This one.
Then.
We have only 500 a year.
I'll send out more inquiries today.
"Pardon my intrusion, but I think I have found what you're looking for."
Won't you come out?
We haven't seen you all day.
We'll have to enlarge it.
Mattocks will help you adjust to our hours.
"Forgive me, do you by any chance have a reliable atlas?"
- I believe so.
- I must check the Nile's position.
My sister tells me it is in South America.
No!
"No, she's quite wrong."
I believe it is in Belgium.
Surely not.
You must be thinking of the Volga.
"- The Volga, which starts in..."
- In Vladivostok.
And ends in...
- Wimbledon.
News of
The queen's death...
And this.
News from the vatican.
"If this letter confirms sebastian's legitimization,"
It should take away any reservations
"You have about a bastard at your side instead of a king,"
As bash will be king one day.
"If it denies his legitimization,"
How could bash blame you for returning to francis?
I know you think you love them both.
"While that may be true,"
I argue that you love one more.
I am afraid.
Open it.
Now you're free
To go to the man you love.
I can't marry you.
"Yes, you can."
Don't let your mother put ideas in your head
"About my ability to protect you, because I will be king."
We can force the pope's hand.
I know that.
"With me,"
You are free and wild.
"You can be who you are,"
And I will always put you first.
"Please, don't."
Say that you love me.
"Say it to me once, because I know that you do."
"I love you, I do."
Say it.
"What's with you and God, anyway?"
"We know you love Miss Orthodox, does that mean you have to wear this costume for her?"
"Yes, but you wouldn't understand since you only love yourself."
- Witty!
- Did you find work?
"No, and please don't bug me about it."
Why don't you move back home?
"I swear to God, if you don't shut up..."
Don't take His name in vain!
Let's not waste time.
I have to open soon.
- Are we watching a movie?
- Patience.
Recognize this picture?
It's from when Morn took you to Paris.
So what?
We know the picture.
Look carefully.
See anything odd?
- Is this a quiz?
- Just play along.
Who took the picture?
"Aunt Rosa, of course."
This is from the same trip.
Aunt Rosa just had the eye surgery that she still talks about.
I don't think she went around taking pictures of you.
"Wow, Shai, James Bond has nothing on you."
She reminds me of Stevie Wonder-.
So who took this picture?
I don't remember a thing.
I was only five.
Look.
Any responsibility I might have is to my clients.
- So there is something?
- You trying to trick me?
I can't have this conversation.
- lf there's a conversation to be had...
- Ready!
"All right, see ya, Mom."
Mm-hmm.
See ya.
"All right, Dad, let's go."
"[Jessie] lf l get something long, I couldn't dance."
"[Lily] I love this, you don't need a longer one."
- What about yours?
- l'll find it a week after the wedding.
I'm just going to go on the record right now to say I really don't like salmon.
Would you look at how beautiful your daughter is?
- Don't I know it.
- Dad hates all fish.
- That is untrue.
- [Eli] Just have pizza.
- We can have pizza for the kids.
- Are we getting paid?
- Can we pay you not to play?
- [knock on door]
"Since Eli's friends are playing, would you like to invite your friends?"
"- No, thank you."
- Somebody want to get the door?
I didn't know planning a wedding would be such a big deal.
- You'll find out soon.
- l'm not getting married till I'm 40.
- You mean when you're old?
- Sorry.
- I don't think I can.
"- Yes, you could."
Kiss me.
I don't know why I should act so experienced.
It was only my second kiss this year.
"It wasn't as good as Rodney's, was it?"
No.
"Hello, I guess I should've phoned but I was in the neighborhood..."
- That's all right.
I have a message for Allison.
Is she home?
"No, she and Selena have just gone over to Kathy Ellsworth's house."
That gives me a good excuse to talk to you.
- May I come in?
"- Oh, of course."
- You have a lovely house.
- Thank you.
Please come in.
This is a very comfortable room.
"Good books, pictures."
My own hotel room is a bit basic.
"I have a mirror for shaving, a basin for washing and a closet to hang my coat."
You ought to find a house.
I'm trying to.
"In the meantime, I have my hotel room, which I clear out of right after dinner."
You said you had something you wanted to tell me.
"I was telling you something, but you weren't listening."
Your husband?
He died when Allison was 2.
And Allison.
- A few years ago.
- She's grown a bit since then.
"Look, we know that she and the guy"
"Were getting real serious, right?"
"Well, maybe she got jealous about something."
[Mutters with mouth full]
Maybe she had somebody jumping.
Mm-mm.
No.
I don't think she's involved.
RICHARD:
Why not?
"She has a pretty face, sweet smile."
"Look, I don't pretend to know the answers."
I'm just trying to figure out the problem.
I'll tell you one thing though...
I want to know everything there
Is to know about that dog.
[Faint radio chatter]
"Now, tell me how you're doing."
I don't know.
Rotten.
Confused.
There's a whole nightmare going on all around me.
I'm starting to see a doctor.
One of those that Mother went to.
"Is that a good idea, uh, all the memories and all?"
Guess I trust him.
One of the few I really trusted.
OTIS:
I wish we could have some good news for you.
We don't have much of it yet.
Seems like with that boy we're just... any little thing
Will be of help.
- You don't know that?
"- Oh, my God."
- I don't think so.
- You tell the story.
"It was just someone driving by and went, ""Denzel."""
"A car full, of..."
"No, there were like six people."
"They were like, ""Denzel."""
And they were drunk.
This was probably a Friday.
I remember a lot of people getting out of bars this night.
"Friday night, 7th Street, Avenue A."
"- Yeah, at like 1 a.m."
- We're in the middle of the action.
- Did you happen to think...?
- Hello.
Not a real punch.
"Oh, I was so terrified I would hit you by accident."
"There was a take where you were supposed to, but you didn't."
Pete asked me to slap you and I couldn't do it.
- I started to cry a little bit.
- I saw you two having that discussion.
I was like:
"""She's gonna hit me."
"I'm ready for it."""
It's gonna be cool.
It'll be a good reaction.
That was the only time I started to cry a little because I felt like...
- You actually started crying?
- I was hiding it.
- At the thought of hitting me?
- Just the thought of hitting Michael without him knowing.
He is taking a left.
Where are you going?
Go straight!
We have almost reached the hospital.
"Okay, go."
Idiots!
Take a left.
- Shut up.
We are caught up in some issue.
I'll call you again.
Hang up.
"Is your phone in within the network range, Vikram?"
Not sure.
I'll have to check.
"After Vikram withdraws money from the bank, take the Perundurai route."
"After reaching the outskirts,"
Take off of the highway and drive the car into a deserted area.
I'll scream and pretend to be panicking.
Vikram will get tensed.
"Hit him then, and push him off the car."
We leave with the money like it is a kidnap drama.
We both will escape.
Driver.
Where are you going?
- What happened?
Not sure.
He is taking the wrong route.
Where are you going?
Go back to the main road.
I'm telling you to turn back!
Why are you taking the wrong route?
Not this hospital.
"- Darling, please don't go."
You don't want a man for a husband.
You want a coward who'll run out on a friend in danger.
"That's not me, and never will be."
"I don't care how much I love you, and I do, very much..."
I'm a soldier...
"I mean, I'm a man first."
"All right, MacCheesecake, get that silly smirk off your face."
- Come on.
- Let's go.
Surely Mother Kali is kind.
"One Englishman fly walks in, and now our web is baited."
More will follow.
Two more have crossed the bridge.
It is well.
Prepare.
You said this place was full of priests.
- Sahib do not give Din chance to say.
"- You've got a mouth, haven't you?"
Quiet.
It's Kali.
A Thug temple.
Why didn't you tell me they were Thugs?
I've a good mind to split you in two and stuff you up an elephant's trunk.
MacChesney roar so loud... poor bhisti cannot get a word sideways between roarings.
Enough of that.
We're here to find Cutter.
We should have brought every man in the regiment.
"I only wish you had, sahib."
"Hello, Din."
"Fine work, bugler."
I knew you'd do it.
Bee sting in 1 is asking for you.
Have them start the orientation manuals.
I'll be with them soon.
"- Carter, MVA, two minutes."
- But not to hold their breath.
"Dr. Carter, so there's a trauma coming in."
Yeah.
"Why don't you take the bee sting in 1, the wrist fracture in 4 and the burning rash in 2?"
Care to give me a hand?
- Help me!
- Why not?
- Help me!
- Hey!
"That's just been mopped, damn it!"
You don't talk if you're having a real seizure.
- Remember that for next time.
"- Come on, man!"
- Think it's always this crazy here?
- Probably.
"They need to bring you back to the VA hospital, sir."
- I don't understand.
- Your driver will explain.
"You guys suck, you know that?"
- Don't bother.
We don't have any beds.
"- So, what else is new?"
"- No, I'm serious."
Try Mercy.
- They' re refusing patients too.
- Then try Rush.
We' re filled.
- I've been bounced all over town with this guy.
"No, I don't."
"- When we found Allison, she was on a direct course for self-destruction."
Poor kid would be dead by now if we hadn't intervened.
"We saved her life, Ted."
You might even say that I still have a hand in keeping her alive.
Should we have another listen?
Don't worry.
Your daughter's not going anywhere.
"Yeah, we can keep her as long as you like."
"I understand your timeline, Liana."
"No, we're arranging transportation now."
Tell Musa his delivery's on its way.
"Florida, seriously?"
Right.
"Well, we'll move somewhere colder, then."
- Canada?
- Maple syrup and mullets?
No thanks.
Did mom fight for me?
"You told her I wanted to live with you, right?"
"Yes, but..."
"She didn't put up a fight, did she?"
Liana was overwhelmed by the news.
She doesn't want us to leave.
- Screw her.
- Don't be like that.
Like what?
She's never home.
She treats you like shit.
- She hates me.
- She doesn't hate you.
- Hey.
Not you.
"No, no, it can't be you, because you're in love."
Is that what you tell yourself?
"""Scott's different and everything's gonna work out because we're in love."""
"Well, if that's what you believe, then you're already dead."
I just...
I just hope your dad has been teaching you moves to protect yourself.
"Actually, he has."
Allison?
What are you doing here?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Scott...
"Scott, I'm fine."
"Scott, I'm fine!"
Scott!
I have a restraining order!
"Trust me, I restrained myself."
(FAST-PACED music playing)
(GRUNTS)
"You can't tell Derek, okay?"
There's a lot more to this that you don't know about.
And just because you got the Alpha bite makeover doesn't give you a license to go around destroying people.
Why not?
That's all anybody ever used to do to me.
I used to have the worst crush in the world on you.
"Yeah, you, Stiles."
And you never once even noticed me.
Exactly how you're not noticing me right now.
Guys!
adrian:
What the hell's going on?
"No, it was a mistake doing it."
And poor Barney.
How is he?
"Doesn't, won't and can't ever know, OK?"
"Wendy, it's over, alright?"
I've learned a very big lesson.
Fuzz!
How hot is your English teacher!
Mr Bartrop made it pretty clear he's at the end of his patience with you.
No-one takes Bartrop seriously.
We do.
(Mobile phone rings) And you must.
"Sorry, work."
He is the principal of a school that your father and I spent a fortune on.
"Isn't that right, Cleave?"
"No, ten units, Race Four, Charlemagne's Pride."
Cleave!
Yes!
"Yeah, a fortune."
"An absolute fortune, mate."
"No, 15 units."
Only to the station.
"You're a really clever boy, Fuzz darling."
If you just knuckle down...
"Tell him, Cleave."
To win.
When have you heard me back a place...
"Most important years in your life, mate."
Why don't you just buy your lunch like everyone else?
"Because there is a perfectly good, cold roast lamb in the fridge."
So is this how it's going to be now?
A permanent cone of silence until one of us dies?
Let's celebrate!
This is not a celebration!
This is a nightmare!
Dr. Lonsdale is obsessed.
He won't quit asking me things about you.
"Oh, and now I'm doing surgical procedures that are way over my head."
Let me guess.
- This is all my fault.
- This is all your fault.
You make things so messy.
Like now!
Oh!
Your underwear is in our communal sink when you have a perfectly functional sink of your own!
"Actually, I clogged my sink up hard."
It's a funny story.
"See, I was trying to wax my..."
Stop.
"The point is, I need you to get your thongs out of the sink of my career."
- What?
- Break it off with Lonsdale.
For real.
"I mean, leave the poor guy no hope."
None.
I can do that.
Consider Dr. Everett Lonsdale completely dumped.
"- Although, you never know."
"- No, no, no."
This time I need you to know.
- Tell me you know.
- All right.
"And don't think, ""you never know,"" either."
- Fine.
"I mean, aren't you happy that you decided to wait?"
"Not to wait, but to wait to do it again?"
'Cause you're worth waiting for.
"And if Jack's not ready, then he's not ready."
Let him do whatever he wants to do.
You just have to stay committed to yourself and your beliefs and who you are.
Wow.
I wish we had been closer the last few years.
"Well, it would have been awkward, considering my mother and your mother were not so friendly."
Yeah.
Think they'll ever be friends?
Yeah.
I do.
My mother is clearly not interested in being with my father anymore.
How's that going?
"For you, I mean?"
Is it weird?
"Uh, yeah."
(CHUCKLES)
"Yeah, it is."
"But you know, she should be who she is, too, and I just have to get used to that."
Do you think your dad and my mom will ever get married?
Think we'll ever be sisters?
I wouldn't mind.
I always kind of wanted a sister.
I always wanted a nice sister.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Let me get that.
"Ugh, she better not have come back."
(SIGHS)
RICKY:
Who is it?
That's a good girl.
This will allow you to climb.
There are other dangers.
"Thankfully, you've got me to protect you."
"I can't climb one-handed, can I?"
Don't think I'm taking my eyes off you for a second.
I would despair if you did.
Let's go.
"(Bird calling, wind whistling)"
(Grunts)
(Panting)
First beanstalk?
"Well, you never forget your first."
"You know, most men would take your silence as off-putting, but I love a challenge."
I'm concentrating.
"No, you're afraid."
"Afraid to talk, to reveal yourself, to trust me."
Things'll be a lot smoother if you do.
You should be used to people not trusting you.
Oh.
The pirate thing.
"Well, I don't need you to share."
You're something of an open book.
Am I?
Quite.
Let's see.
You volunteered to come up here because you were the most motivated.
You need to get back to a child.
That's not perception.
That's eavesdropping.
"Ah, but you don't want to abandon him the way you were abandoned."
Was I?
-Fuck your mother.
"His car was stolen by some Puerto Ricans.They took his cell phone, too."
I don't know what to do.
I already packed a suitcase for my aunt's in Daytona.
Take it easy.
Don't do something you'll regret.
Three weeks before their wedding.
Maybe he needs to be in rehab.
"You can hire someone to do an intervention, apparently."
"Girls, come on."
We're a family here.
Now I gotta spell it out for you?
Take it easy.
Let me figure out how to handle this.
"Please, don't hurt him."
...fight plan will win out.
At this stage the fight is getting closer because....
Why am I always having to come here?
"-How are you doing, man?"
-Did we come at a bad time?
The decorating ideas.
You want to come in?
I'm sorry for the mess.
"Please, this is nothing."
"So, there is a page from Metropolitan Home."
"Now, wait till you see how a mirrored backsplash can amplify a room."
You want something?
Something to drink?
We gotta go.
If you've got a cup of coffee.
"-He loved that little man, by the way."
-Gobbetto.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
What'd you do that for?
I confronted Tyler about his bed-wetting.
[Laughs]
"Hey, hey, hey!"
"Look, we're sorry, okay?"
It's far from okay.
We broke up.
"Well, we'll talk to him."
We'll work it out.
- Yeah.
"- No, I broke up with him."
"After he denied being a bed wetter, he admitted to having a fetish for..."
"Ooh, let's just say it was nasty."
"What do you mean, ""nasty""?"
"Yeah, what kind of nasty things was this dude into?"
Get out of my morgue!
Losers!
The competition has ended.
"Richard Castle, you have solved the murder of Phillip Harris."
[Applause]
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
You're too kind.
"You have proven yourself worthy, and we, the members of the Greatest Detective Society, offer you a place at our table."
"I'm humbled and flattered, but I'm afraid I must decline."
What?
What are you doing?
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work with the best of the best.
Not for me.
How do you know what Christine looks like in the nude?
Because we went swimming and I was in my bikini.
"This is Gerard, the writer I told you about."
He's here to work.
Well...
"Working with the whiskey bottle, by the smell of it."
"Let's go to bed, I'm dead-tired."
Tomorrow morning...!
Look at it this way... ln Germany they're in need of plumbers too.
So I set me up a business with Dutoh labor.
Pour me some more.
"And I got 5 chaps there now, all working black and drawing welfare in Holland besides."
"A lot of sugar, baby."
"And they give me no trouble, 'cause if they did I would report them to Labor Inspection."
Those ham and eggs are just the thing especially after last night.
"Really, Herman."
I mean the long drive.
"Don't be shy, Gerard's a writer."
- He's used to a thing or two.
- Stop it.
"Damn, it's empty."
I'll get a frosh pack.
The world of Peter Stuyvesant so much more to enjoy.
What do you think of him?
He's really got something.
How was it last night?
- Zilch.
- Zilch?
We hadn't met in weeks... and oopla!
He came and zonk!
Fell asleep.
Tough...
Sam:
Let me guess.
"Alonso wasn't a big fan of portion control, was he?"
No.
"During a routine treatment, he almost killed a client."
He sucked out too much fat.
"I demoted him to kitchen duty -- no human contact, just fat from a jar."
"But he said the more I deprived him, the hungrier he got."
[ Sobbing ]
And now three people are dead.
My husband...
[ Sobs ]
Where's Alonso right now?
The -- the basement?
That's -- that's where he spends most of his time now.
[ Sniffles ] What about her?
"Well, till we figure out which side she's on, she stays put."
I am on your side.
Okay.
Then how do we kill him?
[ Sighs ]
[ Grunts ]
You and stupido have no chance.
The fat makes us stronger.
Your sister didn't mention that when she ratted you out.
You're lying!
[ Growls ]
[ Grunting ]
[ Panting ]
"I guess after you killed her husband... you were too monstrous, even for her."
[ Grunts ]
[ Both grunting ]
The Falcon was called by Dragan.
"I made a movie about him, titled ""Tycoon""."
He was a champion at the Sarajevo Olympics.
Then he became a sniper during the siege of Sarajevo.
That's where I met him while I was locked up with the Serbs.
Are you serious?
- One thing?
A sniper.
- A sniper?
Then...
What is the plan?
- We do not complicate things.
Do not we commit?
What does it mean to her 'not to complicate things'?
We do not reveal who we are.
A king's knee would go a long way to many of these parts.
I do not want to go.
- Quiet.
We eat and go.
I'm not hungry.
I do not want to go.
"And so, I found myself facing two of my worst nightmares:"
"Dragan the Falco and Rakia, the Balkan lubricant."
Cheers.
We have said more than once.
More than once.
A million times.
But do you know something?
Now...
Now you can do the second part of the documentary.
"Can you say something, please?"
Thank you.
"Keep him safe and I will light a candle in Torrecastro, Holy Mother."
Why didn't you tell him before?
His burden is great enough.
"Besides, it would ruin his voyage of discovery."
"Prime the pan, close the steel, butt to the ground"
"Charge the barrel, spit the ball,"
Pop it in with your thumb.
"Draw the ramrod, ram it home."
Put it back in its hole.
Bring her back and she's ready to fire
"- You wanted to see me, sir?"
"- Yeah, er..."
Teresa has a plan that might improve the odds in or favour
"I'd like to know what you think, let you decide."
Tell me.
Torrecastro has strong defences.
We can't attack from the outside.
But there must be a way in.
I will go on ahead.
"As a Spaniard, I can find it."
No!
I forbid it.
Easy dear boy
Easy.
"I said I'd let you decide, have the last word"
"Oh, forget it."
He forbids it.
Who does he think he is?
Who does he think I am?
"Evening, Sergeant Harper."
"- You want to make me sergeant, sir?"
- Get a needle and thread.
- That's a pretty good call.
"- That's nice, yeah."
Hey.
Here's a little bit of everything.
Let your education begin.
This place is perfect.
"Seriously, it's totally safe."
"Ryan, how perfect is this place, right?"
"Seriously, what else could you need?"
Anyone bring any food?
Um...food.
Guess we're going on a mission.
Faster!
"Go, Ryan!"
Whoo!
"Well, call me if someone meeting that description comes in."
Thank you.
Nothing at the hospitals.
I'm sure he'll turn up.
Not if he's smart.
I think Seth knows where he is.
Are you accusing him of lying?
That'll be really good for your relationship.
Let the police handle this.
"Oh, I wish you hadn't called the police."
They don't have the resources or the manpower.
Ryan'll just slip through the cracks.
"Sandy, how many of these cases have you seen?"
Or passed across your desk.
What is it about this kid?
I thought I could help him... make a difference.
I was this kid.
In here!
"Joey's in trouble, Ray."
"Ray, let's just break the fuckin' thing down."
Got it.
God.
"His father is serving a life sentence for murder, murdering an ex-girlfriend... with a sawed-off shotgun back in 1988."
The New York Times is quoting one friend of Royster as saying... that the guy had an IQ of 160.
I need your help.
They're tryin' to kill me.
- Who?
"- ""Who""?"
My friends tried to kill me.
Ray Donlan tried to kill me.
Shit!
Holy shit!
Speak of the devil!
"Freddy, forget it."
I don't get this.
This doesn't make any sense.
Why'd they get Superboy off the bridge... to bring him back here and kill him?
Ray had a plan... and it got very fucked up.
"You awake, Freddy?"
I feel like shit.
Fuckin' allergies are killin' me.
Hey.
"In sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life... through our Lord, Jesus Christ... we commend to Almighty God our brother Joseph... and we commit his body to the ground."
The Lord bless him and keep him.

The Lord lift up His countenance upon him... and give him peace.
"Honor Guard, retreat."
"- No, I don't know."
- What the hell are you doing?
Who better than a former Time Master?
And any of you who'd like to join me.
I should stay and help you with Darhk.
And get justice for Laurel.
"That's happening, honey, with or with out you."
I promise.
"Uh, listen, I-I can't pretend to understand this time travel thing, but it sounds important."
So is family.
I wasn't going to go the first time.
Then Laurel convinced me.
And now I'm going to do this for her.
"Well, she'd be proud of you."
How do you know?
'Cause I am.
What German lone word literally means
"- ""the desire to hike""?"
- Wanderlust.
A word which could also be used to describe that look in your eye.
- What look in my eye?
"- Martin, we've been married for 28 years, and you're still a lousy liar."
Now about this new sabbatical.
I decided to decline the invitation.
But...
I think you should.
I-I think...
I think it's important...
"Clarissa, I'm not leaving you."
That's final.
"- Hey, Gray."
- What are you...
"I'm so glad that you could make it, Jax."
What are you up to?
Whatever.
Something the matter?
"The minute the two of us are alone, you can't wait to get out of here."
That's not true.
"The other day, we had that long conversation about stamps."
"About how the price always goes up, but never goes down."
- Did you wanna revisit that?
- You know what I'm talking about.
You and Christine got divorced and it's kind of like we did too.
"But, whatever."
I guess I'm the jerk for even caring.
- Are you serious?
"- No, forget I said anything."
I guess I'm the ass for bringing it up.
"Okay, okay."
You know what?
I'm sorry.
You're right.
I guess things have changed.
"Um, look, I've got errands, and then later I'm taking Ritchie to the batting cages."
You're welcome to come along if you want.
- We could spend the day together?
"- Yeah, it'll be fun."
"We'll grab burgers, go to the batting cages, anything you want."
"- That'll be great, Dad."
- Did you just...?
- No.
- Good.
[SIGHS]
CHRISTINE:
"Good morning, ladies."
Or should I say bonjour and...
"Wow, you're a bad stalker, Max."
There's two things the Slop won't do.
Alert the proper authorities of my flight pattern or step foot in Texas.
I'll drop you here.
"When I agreed to follow you cross-country to chase your ex-boyfriend,"
"I didn't realize I'd be thrown out of a plane, scavenging for my belongings and fighting a snake for my favorite pants."
"You can have them, sir!"
Ah!
Found my toothbrush.
"Max, that's disgusting."
"Oh, you're right."
This isn't mine.
"Ah, found a purse..."
Under this syringe.
Anything in there?
"Uh... nah, pretty tapped out, which is too bad 'cause you could use a two-day heroin nap."
I meant my bag.
Look what else survived!
Ah-ha!
My Popchips!
Only to meet an unfortunate end.
"Oh, no, Max, my wallet."
"Mm, yeah, I know."
You've aged a lot since that license picture.
"No, it's gone."
All of our cash and our credit cards were in there.
What are we gonna do?
I'm freaking out.
"Nah, nah, nah, calm down."
Caroline will get us out of this.
"Oh, wait."
You're Caroline.
"How many people have you killed, rescuing me?"
I don't know.
Less than I'll save if I get that information.
That doesn't make it right.
- It's still playing God.
"- That's a doctor's prerogative, is it?"
- Don't preach to me.
- No.
I'm not.
I'm sorry.
I've spent my whole life trying to prove that I was different from him.
Only to realise that I'm just the same.
I've killed people.
I killed my own fiancé.
That wasn't your fault.
It was my fault.
It was my fault that we were abducted.
He hated the camps.
"He hated the danger, and I made him stay."
Because I wanted to save that boy's mother but I didn't save her.
She died anyway.
"So they'd blame you too, would they?"
"They're dead now, and you'll never forgive yourself because neither would they?"
They deserved to live.
"Clare, have you ever saved anyone that didn't?"
(SPEAKING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
Fuck!
Fuck me!
Fuck!
Can somebody get this fuck off me?

Where's Hendricks?
"No, I work on Saturdays."
Big shoplifting day.
I catch dozens of punks like you.
Thas wonderful.
If everyone were that dedicated...
Bet you're an ace at Blackjack...
How'd you guess?
I know you inside out.
Lots of guys like you around.
They stick to you like flies these days.
Looking for trouble?
"No, just like a pair of jeans..."
Is my brother's birthday.
"Down there, on the right just past the television sets."
I'll frisk you later.
"Hey, look!"
Must be your first paycheck!
Not a chance.
I met this rich lady...
She's hooked on me!
Ursula's very generous.
Congratulations!
You don't need that badge your hair tonic gives you away!
You're lucky I'm in a good mood today.
Me too.
Life is beautiful.
I'd almost like to touch you...
"If I touch you, you'll know it!"
You feel up the salesgirls?
I'll throw you out on your ass.
Understand!
Little punk.
- No fear or favour.
How about Mr. Crawford?
How does he take it?
- I've not had occasion...
- Not had occasion?
"He's made of good stuff, he must be spirited."
"Therefore, he must get into mischief."
"If he gets into mischief, he must be punished."
The captain insisted on no favouritism.
- You heard him say that.
"- Yes, sir."
"Well, be watchful, Mr. Kilpatrick."
- And diligent.
"- Yes, sir."
"And if you ever need my advice, don't hesitate to ask."
"Thank you, sir."
"- Don't lie, son."
"- I didn't do it, sir."
- Are those your initials?
"- Yes, but I just made a scratch."
- You could hardly see it.
- You did?
- You lied to me.
- I thought...
- It's so marked-up anyway.
- It shouldn't be.
There's a rule against defacing the table.
I've been lenient with you.
Too lenient.
- Anything to say?
- Only that someone else must have...
- I have nothing to say.

I saw someone back out.
We have a leukemia patient who's having trouble finding a genetic match.
Where do I sign?
Kelly's your donor.
My God.
We had to take Anna off chemo.
That's it?
You just let her die?
"I'm sorry, Kelly."

How much money... 1000000.
The deal is fixed in 1000000 for this car.
This car!
How can this be?
That's what I'm thinking.
How can it be?
No one came to see it for seven months now coming to buy it.
Who is the buyer?
Laxminarayan.
This car won't go anywhere today because today at 11:00 Laxminarayan is coming to see this car.
"So both for you, clean it up."
"So when he sees it, He shouldn't be able to take his eyes off."
Come at 2:00 and take the advance.
What are you doing?
What are we going to do?
We'll lose our diamond.
We won't let Laxminarayan get here.
We'll kidnap him.
"I must close this deal today, I'll have to impress everyone with my charm."
How do you know the name?
Since childhood.
How?
Who told your Papa?
"Naturally Sir, He'd know."
If he bought undergarments from my shop then off course he knows my name.
Laxminarayan Undergarments Salesman.
My name is Laxminarayan.
You mean your...
Yes...
and you know my nature.
My name is Laxminarayan.
And I don't know your nature.
I'm going to meet my friend.
Sir.
Yes.
- I'm from Chennai.
"2 days ago, a man was found dead in a road accident in Kanyakumari."
Yes.
How do you know him?
Actually...
Then why do you want to know about him?
"Sir, I'm from the media."
You guys want news 24/7!
Why do you torture us for that?
There is a guy called Panju.
He is dealing with this case.
Go meet him.
"Thank you, sir."
Give him the keys.
Don't drink and drive.
Got it?
"- Okay, sir."
"Sorry, sir."
- Bye.
He is a relative of the MLA.
Won't you enquire all these things in advance?
"I will be careful hereafter,Sir."
Have you caught a single proper case till now?
It doesn't make a difference either way...
It's my mistake to have become a cop.
Don't go and drag another problematic case just because I said this now.
Get a case that will bring honours to the station and me.
Bring something that brings cheers to me and the station.
"Definitely, sir."
"And, up...up, up, up, up, up, up, up."

Any card.

The reason for asking the bishop was to get rid of them.
Come and sit down and 'ave a drink.
We are on duty.
Sounds as if they're having a lovely time.
That conjuror's clever.
The way he produced a rubber chicken from the bishop's trousers!
Yeah.
What about the wine they made disappear?
Three bottles of Montrachet and four bottles of Château Lafite.
Really.
I thought you wanted the workers to have a good time.
Not when I'm waitin' on 'em.
They're as bad as the toffs.
They ignored us.
That Scotchman didn't ignore Miss Poppy.
I don't know.
My math teacher?
Your math teacher?
You got through Harvard Medical School for your math teacher?
"Yeah, no."
I guess I was trying to prove myself to myself.
"You know, I needed..."
-...to prove that I wasn't a loser.
-A loser?
Why would you think you're a loser?
I was around a lot of losers growing up and....
"Not worthless-type loser or, you know, bad person."
Just....
Just lost.
People at loose ends.
And I didn't want to be that.
I wanted to be anything but that.
You're everything but that.
I set up a meeting with his mom.
"It's not protocol, but I think it'll help."
Is he still violent?
No.
"No, he was never violent."
I thought you had to restrain him.
"No, I sedated him."
"-Oh, I thought he was psychotic."
-Huh?
No.
He had a psychotic episode.
He OD'd on methamphetamines.
But he's not psychotic in general.
When did you start reading Spin magazine?
"Now I'm torn, aren't I?"
"I mean, I don't want stolen goods on me hands, but if it's a chance of meeting you again, Sergeant..."
"Your T Dan, what's he look like?"
Ooh... 40ish.
Short dark hair.
A bit taller than you.
"Beautiful skin, soft blue eyes."
How much did you give him for this lot?
£42.10.
"It's a hard life, isn't it?"
~ There you are.
"~ Thanks, John."
There's no missing person's report matching the dead man's description.
The pathologist hasn't got anything yet and won't have until tomorrow.
And we've got no Gwendolen Howard on any of our files.
"Making progress, then(!"
)
"Don't shoot the messenger, Inspector Bacchus."
She never irritate you?
No.
"Our man's not a thief, John."
That pawnshop bloke could have sniffed out a thief out a mile away.
We watched him do it.
He's pawning the family silver.
"This is a man with a wife, who's got rings and necklaces."
"At least, she did have."
"So, where is she?"
What's she waiting for?
~ It's dead.

How do you know that?

"I've come to a decision, Ma."
What about?
Enlisting.
What?
- All the lads are talking about it.
"Well, you can't enlist."
You can't stop me when I'm 17.
- You're forgetting one thing -
Neither can Dad.
- I'm not talking about him.
I'm talking about your condition.
"If Doc Campbell gave me the all-clear, so will the navy."
The navy?
"- As soon as I'm 17, I'm going to join the navy."
Have you told your dad any of this?
"No, he fell asleep before I could."
"My mind's made up, Ma."
It's what I want.
I'll see you in the morning.
We need to order a new stethoscope.
I suspected it was on the way out.
Just tried it on myself and it appears I'm already dead.
This is the map Mom left for us.
There's four roller coasters.
"Oh, no, no, no."
"We agreed, no roller coasters."
"Go on any ride you like, but no roller coasters."
Because I am scared of the roller coasters.
"Ha, ha."
"Oh, you think that's funny?"
You think that that is funny?
Okay.
No roller coasters.
(PHONE RINGS)
Dunham.
Where?
"Uh, no, I'll tell Walter and Peter."
So we're gonna have to take a rain check.
"That's okay, Aunt Liv."
I know you have an important job.
"Well, I'm gonna call the Jacobson's and see if they can baby-sit."
And then I'll...
- Make pancakes?
"- Yes, ha, ha."
Then I'll make you pancakes.
- You're sure it was him?
"- Uh, we don't have security footage yet but an eyewitness said that he was wearing a gray suit and a hat."
"Quote: ""One of those old ones, from the '60s."""
- We don't have information on the girl?
- No.
The police showed her picture around the museum.
No one knew who she was.
- Is Walter awake?
"- Oh, yeah."
OK?
So now it's time for you to be honest about how you feel about Justin.
Let me put this in a way you'll understand.
You've been an emotional grower.
Now you need to be an emotional show-er.
I mean Justin's your best friend.
Have you ever even told him that?
"No, but in my defence I"
- have a really good reason not to.
- Why is that?
Because he wants me to so bad.
"I'm disappointed in you, Danny."
Good night...
Oh.
You want to get high and watch wrestling?
- To Candace and Justin.
Cheers.
- Thank you.
This is the happiest day of my life.
Did he say happiest day or last day?
"Babe, you can sulk about this whole Danny situation this whole time."
Now I know that you said you want to do whatever you want to make me happy.
"If you want to make me happy, you go out there and you get Danny"
"Yes, ma'am."
"- Guys, I'm here."
Where's Justin?
- You just missed him.
- He went out looking for you.
- Aw crap.
Let me go see if I can catch him
"Well, look like those guys will never..."
- I got the text.
"- Just have fun, baby, that's all that counts."
"So, Mom, I was thinking about what you said last night."
About not giving up?
- Right.
- And I think I want the surgery.
Try to repair the nerve damage.
Ok.
Um...
The doctor said that it's a difficult and complex procedure.
"And if things don't go as hoped, your hand could actually get worse."
"Yeah, I mean, she said there's a chance of that."
"She also said that if the surgery did cause damage, that it could... it could actually be permanent."
You've got almost 95 percent function now.
That's better than the doctors even hoped.
"But if I'm gonna play piano, though, I need 100 percent."
So I'd like to give it a shot.
- So we agreed?
You're good?
- Yeah.
It's the right call.
- Ok.
- Ok.
- I'll let Brandon know.
- Ok.
"Oh, and tell him if he wants to come by, that, you know, I'm here."
- I will.
- Ok.
Gotta hit the shower.
- Let yourself out?
- Yeah.
Thanks a lot for letting me barge in like this.
Appreciate it.
How beautiful it is!
You like it?
I haven't seen such a lovely house in my life.
This is the world's most beautiful house.
"Feels like it is not on the ground, but somewhere in the clouds."
I feel like...
"Believe me, Mr Ravi, you won't find a better building contractor than myself in the whole of Bombay."
All right.
You go with my secretay and check out my vacant plot at Juhu.
And build a house for me.
Exactly like this.
How long will it take to build it?
- Say around 6 months.
Make it as soon as possible.
Don't wory about the money.
"Ifthat's the case, I'll show you better designs than this."
"I just want this design, Mr. Malkhani."
Because this is the world's most beautiful home.
"Feels like it is not on the ground, but somewhere in the clouds."
"I get it, Mr Ravi."
You are strange!
Where are you?
Can't even get to see you at the Gym.
Nothing as such.
- Who was he?
An architect.
Why?
What for?
I am building a house.
- A house?
What's wrong with this?
I have travelled much.
Why did you run away then?
In time for the promotion.
There were only two of us:
"I, with 30 years of experience in the field."
And this kid from the academy.
It was full of extensions.
Artificially intelligent implants and so on.
There could only be one of us.
We treat it the same way.
Or your way.
"I guess the manager was probably good, so..."
Trajan son of a bitch...
Trajan became the new commander.
And I...
I was thrown out of this garbage.
Trajan?
General Trajan?
General?
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, that suits you."
I always knew that son of a bitch would come up easily.
"At that moment he was so deep in the ass of his superiors,"
"I could smell, what they had for breakfast."
Duty calls!
That's where I meet the Noids right there.
Make sure you go straight.
The 306 cartridges you have.
"I do not want to have lead poisoning,"
Before it's all over here.
Too small for a humanoid.
Who you are?
- Shit!
Kix!
Give me that.
Have your guys do door knocks.
Talk to every neighbor.
"Tell everyone if they find anything, give me a call."
This is Detective Wagenbach.
I told you I needed a rush on those prints.
We don't know she's dead.
She could still be alive.
"And if she is, I'd hate to see your backlog cost her her life."
- You told Claudette I was gone for an hour?
- You were gone for an hour.
Jesus!
She's all over my ass about this Tio connection.
She said she'd talk to you.
I figured the truth was the safest bet.
- Now it looks like I'm lying to her.
- You are lying to her.
"- What, are you trying to be a wiseass?"
"- No, I'm just..."
Just shut the hell up!
- Christ!
- Where are we headed?
I got things to do.
I gave you guys to Aceveda for the day.
- What?
"- Apparently, a group of male hustlers... is hangin' out on the same block as Aceveda's campaign headquarters."
He's setting up a sting operation.
I volunteered you guys.
- You can't be serious.
- Your shirt's gay enough for the job.
- What do you mean you gave us to Aceveda?
What...
How'd it go with Dr. Klein?
"- Oh, fine."
Fine.
Good.
Any change since your last physical?
No.
Everything's
- Everything's fine.
"Oh, great."
"You want a drink before dinner, honey?"
[Clicks Tongue] No.
"Well, there's some fruit, if you wanna munch."
"No, uh"
- No munching.
"Bob, is"
- Is there something you're not telling me?
"Well, I just have to go on a little diet."
I have to start counting the calories and... try to get rid of that.
"Oh, that?"
"Honey, that's just a little happy fat."
I think it's cute.
[Chuckles]
"Emily, fat isn't cute unless you're nine months old and you're playing with a Busy Box."
"Well, it shouldn't be hard to lose three or four pounds."
"- Uh, eight pounds."
- Eight?
"Well, I know you can do it, and I'll help you every step of the way, Bob."
I'll help you every inch of the way.
"Emily, uh, why are you making such a big thing about eight pounds?"
"Well, eight pounds are not easy to lose."
"Well, they are for me, once I set my mind to it."
"- Uh, w-what's that?"
"Oh, Miss Pugh, your uncle's here to see you."
Forgive the deceit.
Your landlady didn't look the sort to approve a gentleman caller.
"To be perfectly frank, she's the first person I've met for weeks who didn't recognize me."
She doesn't hold with the pictures.
Ungodly.
Ah!
That's...
That's charming.
It's from Rose and Lily.
The real Rose and Lily.
They ran away to join the ATS.
"Rose thought if she could fix a propeller in a film, she could learn to mend an engine in real life."
Ah.
They're both mechanics now.
Um...
Baker's planning a new film.
Air-raid wardens.
Wants me in it.
He's pretty much left the part up to me.
"So, I was thinking, newly retired cat burglar, not quite reformed."
That's why he's so good at the rescues.
He knows the way in and out of any property.
"Thing is, in the hands of the wrong writer..."
"So, I was wondering if you would consider putting your time and talent..."
I don't do that anymore.
I'm sorry.
I just can't.
You'll get-
- You'll get soap in your eyes.
Here.
Hmm.
It was.
"You're a smart man, Detective, smarter man than I."
Why do you think you have nothing on us?
Because there's nothing to be had
When I killed Sid...
I looked him in the eye and I told him that he was going to die.
So just tell me the truth.
You do realize that we can still charge you for accessory.
Confessing won't change that.
"Oh, I'm prepared to accept whatever the punishment may be."
"If I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead."
Tell me there was pento in the needle.
There was.
Watered down pento.
Hmm.
"I don't understand the game, Mary."
The only crime that Mary's guilty of is trying to protect me.
"Save me, really."
She can't help herself.
It's just what she does.
"We're not the same, you and I."
You sell drugs to addicts.
You murdered Sid.
You came after my daughter!
You're not a healer.
You create pain.
"I don't like games, Mary."
Police!
Put the weapon down!
"Mary, you okay?"
Mary?
I need something to stop the bleeding.
The half you don't need.
Alright.
Alright.
I'd miss you.
I miss you more than I can say.
You've to take this.
Keep going.
Mrs.Cole!
?
Watch yourself there.
Mrs.Cole?
Hm?
I thought you was under it.
I was in the office...hmm.
I might have to borrow clothes.
Talk to the costumes mistress.
But don't be surprised is she tetchy.
Parachute line took the roof off studio 4 last night.
And have Panzer division uniforms ruined.
They are saying it was the worst night to air bombing yet.
Nothing left of Wimbledon apparently.
The props master hasn't turned up and the best-boy is in the hospital and no one knows where the group is.
So we are having to make do with whatever we can get.
There'll be tears before bedtime.
Mark my words.
"Can we save that lamp till we roll, please?"
Sorry Mr.Hilliard.
More?
Much more.
This man hasn't had a bath since last time we fell off the boat.
Change of plans.
Tool seat from Uncle Frank's meety to fetch Tony windy propeller.
Did he kiss you?
No.
"That's kind of sweet, actually."
Hi.
This is Cindy.
This is a spectrum analyzer.
It makes graphic representations of the music.
Watch.
- Who's the girl?
- Rose Morgan.
Henry Fine is a professor in anthropology.
"Beautiful music, isn't it?"
Beautiful atmosphere.
I enjoyed that.
- Thank you so much for inviting me.
"- Oh, my pleasure."
Why don't you come up to my apartment?
I want to give you a copy of my book.
I'd love that.
"Your book, I mean."
Not to come up to your apartment.
"But, Rose, I'm inviting you up."
"If you like this kind of music, I have some wonderful CDs, but they're also in my apartment."
"Greg, I have to be honest with you."
I'm a bit out of practice with this.
"Rose, I want you to feel comfortable."
That's very important to me.
I want to tell you up front.
I'm not interested in sex.
- You're not?
"- No, and it has nothing to do with you."
It has to do with what you were talking about in your class.
And he was right.
Those years are gone and my chance with them.
"I'll leave tonight, Sarah Beth."
But I'm not sorry I came now because I'll take something back with me which means a great deal to me.
The knowledge that he has you.
"You to fight for him, be there when he needs you."
To be what I wasn't strong enough to be.
He didn't come to St. Louis for nothing.
"And now when he's lost it all, everything when he needs something human at last you'll come into the field."
"No, he didn't come to St. Louis for nothing."
"And all at once, that gives me peace a kind of happiness even."
I haven't felt that for a very long time.
Just one thing.
"Some night when he's sitting on the porch, Sarah Beth, give him a kiss from me."
"Don't, Mother."
Don't.
"I'm glad you're home, colonel."
Buckboard with Sarah Beth get in;
I missed seeing her start.
"Maybe you'd better go on in the house, colonel."
jim:
Sarah Beth;
"-Papa, come here."
"Mother wanted to be waiting for you here, Papa."
The way she used to be.
Lutie.
You're well;
"Yes, Jim."
And you;
You look as you always did.
"Do I, Jim;"
Papa.
- You cheated.
"Stop, stop."
- You're so cute when you pout.
"- Stop, stop, stop."
Poor baby.
He's a loser.
- Stop.
"- Oh, he's just a little loser."
- You know what I think?
"I think we worry too much about Brian and Adam, you know?"
"I think they're gonna be fine, don't you think?"
I sure hope so.
Wanna slap it?
Wanna slap it?
"Yeah, you don't want to start planning two of everything, like when your married friends split up."
"Honestly, I can't believe all this is about Marjorie."
"Baby, uh, these people are her friends, okay?"
"I'm just saying, you were standing-- you saw Adam's face--right next to him at the altar."
I don't care what she was going through.
You don't put someone through that--public humiliation.
"- Orange, please."
"- All right,"
- this is the last orange.
- So she should have gone through with it
- so as not to embarrass Adam?
- Yes.
No.
"If she didn't want to get married, she saved him the trouble."
I don't even know why she said yes.
She's a coward.
I think it actually takes a lot of courage to do what she did.
"No, no."
Place looks good.
I'm excited you finally get to see our renovations.
Can't believe that excites you.
"God, you sound like a brat who lives in a dump in New York."
Don't be shitty.
My house is not a dump.
Wouldn't know.
I've never been.
Lots of fights happened in this room.
Only with you.
We're going out.
Get yourself dressed up.
It's gonna be a big night. (LAUGHS)
"OK, could you stop doing that?"
It's really annoying.
I planned on going away for a week.
- You know this is important to me.
"- I know, but it wasn't supposed to start for 10 days."
They changed it.
I don't know what to tell you.
You're not being really supportive right now.
You know this is an amazing opportunity for me.
Tell me the good version of this conversation.
"""You got the job?"
"""Congratulations, Ashley."
I'm so happy for you.
"""Although I admit to being a little disappointed,"
"""I understand that these things happen."
"""I'm so proud of you, baby."""
That's basically what I said.
I would never say that.
I am proud of you.
"Sir, he is that fellow."
Bad news!
I sent your son into Coma and I will send you to Tihar jail.
Get Ready!
"I'll break all of your bones, bastard!"
Good news sir.
"Sir, he said bad news and this guy said good news."
This fellow is him sir.
That stranger has agreed.
"If you make your Facebook friend agree, it is like the scene is all set sir."
Okay..
Is it not nice?
See that one
"Hi Ria,"
- Where are you?
In Kalamandir
- Turn back once.
Are you surprised?
- I am shocked.
Why?
When I was thinking it would have been better if someone was there to say second opinion on this shirt and you correctly came in time.
"Come, you can see and say it."
Where is brother?
He may have been to the trial room.
How is this?
Looks dreadful!
You can be however in normal times.
It is the marriage of your sister so you should be decent.
Again you?
Why are you following me?
"This is the final warning, if you talk again I will shoot you."
Sorry sir.
Okay.
Bye.
"She was done, right?"
I should probably get going.
"Um, didn't you just leave?"
"I wanted to talk to you, and, um..."
Kyle said that I should...
use the front door.
Okay.
"Um... your parents didn't press charges, and they could have."
They understand that what I did to you wasn't me.
And I'm really lucky that they do.
"Yeah, you are."
Kyle explained everything to you.
I didn't want to beat you up.
It was my programming.
Things... went wrong.
"So, what, you caused the most traumatic experience of my life, and now you're telling me that it's not your fault?"
I'm telling you I'm sorry.
I'm not here to ruin things anymore.
I'm here to help.
I'm trying.
"Then I guess I can try, too."
Okay.
Hey.
Want some help?
Dig in.
"Hey, I thought you got rid of this."
I got a little nostalgic and rescued it from the reject pile.
I got a little nostalgic myself today.
"Being back on campus again, no office politics, no corporate crap, just this flow of ideas."
It was a real give-and-take.
'£15.9 shillings a week to £20.
'The dustcarts stayed in the depot.
'The general opinion was that the whole business stank.'
He's got wooden splinters in his head.
"Body was discovered just after 7:00, sir."
The sergeant reckons he was a jumper.
~ Really?
~ There's been a few of them lately.
"They've pulled two out of the Tyne already this month, sir."
"If he was aiming for the river, he was a bad shot."
Debt.
Unemployment.
Is this where they found him?
He hasn't been moved?
"No, sir."
There's no blood around him.
He was dead when he hit.
~ Have we got a name?
"~ We've got his wallet, but there's no ID."
There's no money in it either.
"So, robbery, maybe?"
We've got this.
"It's a receipt for a pawnbroker, a couple of betting slips from the dog track and a note that says, ""Gwendolen Howard, 5:00 Wednesdays."""
Who's she?
Gwendolen Howard?
Sir?
"Sir, we're a bit shorthanded with the bin strike."
I need to release men to other duties if we don't absolutely need the scene sealed.
"It's a crime scene, Sergeant."
"No, no, no."
You heard him.
Seal it.
"Yes, love it!"
Let's choose team-mates.
Who's sporty here?
"Everyone, who's good at sport?"
No!
"Whatever it is that's happening out here, no!"
And why is water boy strapped to a column?
Water man.
"But, yes, I completely agree."
We're playing jugball.
"As I say, no."
"You're going to the Legal Department, where I put you."
"Come on, it's eight-all."
"I'm sorry that this massive grain company is getting in the way of your cretinous game, shredder."
"It's not cretinous, it's brilliant!"
"And if you actually cared about this company, you'd give people squeakier chairs and lower the price of toilets or whatever."
"Right, guys?"
Yeah...
"Well, something like that."
OK.
"Well, clearly, someone's a little bit tired."
So let's go and get a nice glass of milk.
I'm not tired!
You're tired.
You're tired and you're fired.
Excuse me?
You're firing me?
"That's right, Flave."
It's time to make way for a guy who knows what's really needed here.
Ha!
You don't even know how to wipe your own bottom.
"Not me, the Professor."
They took care of Tunney when he was gonna talk.
How come Figgis didn't do somethin' about it?
He was Ray's right-hand man back then.
Then they tried to kill Superboy.
"They were hiding him, Freddy."
Then they burned down Figgsy's house when they think he might talk.
You don't know that.
We went over every inch of that house.
Not everything is a hexagonal conspiracy.
I think you been hangin' around Figgs too much.
He's the only one getting cash out of that house... and he's totally playing you—
just like those assholes in the city.
"And I'm sorry, but... there's nothing you can do about this."
"Yes, there is."
"I can find Superboy, and I can bring him in."
I'm going back upstate.
I want my old job back.
I don't want any part of this.
I don't want any part of this place.
"Come on, Cindy."
Shit.
Freddy.
"Look, I don't know about Ray, okay?"
But everyone in Garrison is not a murderer.
No.
"They just keep their eyes closed and their mouths shut, just like me."
"Hey, Freddy."
"All right, thank you."
Thank you.
"Thank you, sweetheart."
I love you too.
"All right, terrific."
Jackson's birthday is June 15th.
"Oh, no, I'm sorry."
"Uh, yes, I'm leaving."
But none of you are.
You may go when you're done with the re-shelving.
Enjoy the rest of your evening.
The principal wanted to see me?
No...
I did.
I'm concerned about the detention today.
How Allison ended up in there with you and Mr. stilinski.
A sink was ripped off the wall.
You're lucky I'm here to explain that to people somehow.
You realize that?
Yeah.
I do now.
Good.
Are you having sex with my daughter?
I'm not having sex with your daughter.
I certainly hope not.
Hello?
It means he was born after his mom died... by c-section.
They had to pull him out of her dead body.
"You okay, dude?"
So was it an accident or not?
"The word all over the report is ""inconclusive."""
Then his parents could have been murdered?
"If they were, then it falls in line with the Kanima myth."
You know?
It seeks out and kills murderers.
But for Jackson?
Or for whoever's controlling him?
Ah!
"If only I had my wallet, I wouldn't have inconvenienced you like this!"
"Once I get my wallet back, I'll pay you back."
Teacher Gil...
Did you get scolded a lot?
It's because I'm so upset!
You have no idea how dashing and what a gentleman my Yoon Jae is!
You made people say that he's an idiot...
It's because I'm sorry and upset for Yoon Jae!
Go home and stay there quietly.
Don't go around again and cause more trouble.
If you need something...
I'll get it for you.
You'll get it?
Forget it!
"Don't worry about it, I'll take care of it."
Go home.
"Don't go anywhere else, okay?"
Does she know how nice these clothes are?
Anything I wear is a total killer.
I only look like an idiot because I'm wearing it in this body.
Well...
"When I get my wallet back, I'll dress him like this."
Yoon Jae...
It would be nice if I could see you before I left.
Your call cannot be connected...
Um...
Can I found out what room Patient Kang Gyung Joon is in?
Room 560.
Okay.
Hey.
Doctor Seo's really different today.
We don't want to be good.
We want to be bad.
Yeah.
"Hey, uh, let's go, you guys."
My mom's gonna yell at me.
"See you tomorrow, Tia."
We'll find Tony tomorrow for sure.
"Let's stay close together on the way out, guys."
Good.
This is professor Gannon...
Tony!
He's in some kind of a room.
Like a hospital.
With machines and instruments and things.
"Oh, that's easy."
All we have to do is check all the hospitals.
While we going around looking for a fight.
Come on.
You will now function exclusively under control.
You will no longer think independently.
All thinking and reasoning will be done by the voice that commands you.
Do you understand?
- Yes.
- What is your name?
- Tony.
- Where are you from?
Witch Mountain.
Sounds like some hick town to me.
How did you suspend Mr. Sickle in mid-air?
By energizing matter.
Do you mean to say that you can control molecular flow?
"Yes, sir."
Mmm-hmm.
I'm fine.
"Nothing, huh?"
Doesn't look like nothing to me.
"You got a new tie there, huh?"
Classy.
Gray.
Didn't know that was the new power color.
Strong choice.
Thanks.
Mr. Gates.
"Okay, fellas, we all have a lot of work to get back to, so I'm gonna keep this snappy."
I've looked through all of your proposals.
"And while I think all of you have more than a little something to offer, the proposal that hits the nail on the head is the one that shows the most leadership and vision that is gonna be required to take this company into the future."
"Congratulations, Felzner."
"Thank you, sir."
You are welcome.
And you can move into that new office of yours whenever you'd like.
"Excuse me, sir?"
Mr. Gates?
"Yes, Allan?"
"Listen, you said that you liked my work."
You said that it was strong...
"I said I liked your work, Allan."
And I do.
"Okay, so why am I not getting the promotion?"
"I mean, I've been here longer than Felzner."
"Felzner is the future, Allan."
It's as simple as that.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'm fine."
Don't mess it up.
Son of a...
"Captain, where are we?"
We have reason to believe that the explosive was a diversion.
Diversion from what?
An armed team has taken over the White House.
Do we have the president?
I spoke to Walker.
He had eyes on Eagle.
Fifteen minutes is a lifetime.
Radio chatter indicated they were headed for the PEOC.
No contact.
We have to assume they've been compromised.
We gotta get you to a phone.
Call SEAL Team Six and they come in here and they'll shoot these assholes in the head.
- We keep a satphone in the residence.
- Great.
Where's that at?
Of course it is.
- You ever been rock climbing?
- We climbing this?
"Unless you got a better idea, yeah."
"No, I don't."
"By the way, John Cale."
- James Sawyer.
"-I'll get you out of here, sir."
Just follow me up.
"Yeah, I'm right behind you."
Make sure you have one handhold before you let go of the other one.
"- Whatever you do, I'll do."
I ain't doing that shit.
The scene here at the White House is getting more chaotic every second.
Your unit served in both.
McKinney was there.
No chance McKinney did it.
"Look, the guy doesn't have a alibi."
He's impulsive and he's angry.
He's too angry to have done it.
CAROLINE:
I agree with Booth.
This was controlled.
It took planning.
McKinney's not capable of that.
"Take a look at this, huh?"
Look at those tire marks.
AUBREY:
They're fresh.
Yeah.
"McKinney was parked there, a half block away."
Then it makes sense that these tire marks are from the car that took Aldo.
The tracks run north.
There's a highway on-ramp three blocks away.
No way he took it.
How do you know that?
Because he's planned.
He thinks of everything.
"He's calculated, okay?"
There's no way he's gonna take the highway.
"I mean, there's surveillance cameras all over the place."
CAROLINE:
That explains why we have next to nothing to work with.
"Ah, not true, we know how he thinks."
What does that get us?
"We know that he takes the road less travelled, Aubrey."
"Summer, how come we keep looking for Pancakes when there's a giant elephant in the room ?"
We walk around the elephant.
"It may be big, but we are crafty."
The boys should have been back over an hour ago.
Aren't you worried ?
"No, I'm not worried."
"I'm freaking terrified, okay ?"
That's why I'm focusing on just finding Pancakes and not about the fact that my boyfriend could be laying on the side of the road ravaged by zombies.
"Okay, well, let's go look for them."
In what ?
They took the only car.
Have you thought of that ?
"Well, let's listen to the radio and see if there's any news."
The radio stopped working with the aftershock.
What was that ?
Pancakes ?
Maybe it was Ryan and Seth.
Why would they need to break a window ?
I don't know.
What do we do ?
"Quick, hide !"
Shh !
"No, no, no."
"Summer, wait."
I've got a better idea.
"Summer, come here."
Shh !
You received a makeover under false pretenses.
You lied about having asthma.
Do you even like Bob Seger ?
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I did it.
"She doesn't realise that she can have me as well as you lot, but she will and when she does I'll be here, waiting."
You can use the inside toilets from now on if you want to.
Thanks.
"Electricity, 40 a quarter, and I'll get you your rent book."
Hey?
We have to find a way of getting shot of her.
We just have to...
"Sheila, will you..."
"I'm not fighting her any more, Frank."
If she wants the babies she's entitled to that.
"Yeah, but, Sheila..."
"It's too exhausting, hate."
"Anyway, the best woman's won."
"I'm married to you now, there's nothing she can do about that."
And if you love someone set them free.
"I'm sitting you free, Frank."
I'm trusting you.
"Hey, hey."
Hey!
What you doing?
There was too much sunlight yesterday.
I'm feeling a bit insidey outsidey.
Thought I'd make these for myself.
'Squidgy-gate.
Camilla-gate.
'Watergate.
Gareth Gates.
"'I mean, what's it all about, eh?"
All these private secrets?
"'What good does it do, eh, to let them out?"
'All you get's a load of heartache and misery.
"'And what you don't know can't hurt you, that's what I say."
Put down that gun.
that's it.
Number 43?
!
Yu Ominae!
You are nothing more than a killing machine.
I'm...
You've seen the death of your parents on the people you've killed.
Such a thing must have drove you mad.
I am not a machine.
I am a human being.
even if I must die.
A human?
God?
You make me laugh.
Where on earth is a God who was made by humans?
when it began resonating with your power.
What do you think you can do with that body full of junk?
I am God!
I will kill all of Man!
you will already be dead!
Idiot.
Damn it!
just a little more... and my nightmare's would have been washed away!
A brats fairy tale dream is over.
What are you doing?
I said that I wasn't going to be a tool for murder.
Noah's self-destruct sequence has just been activated.
What?
which was in different dimensional space will be swallowed up by three-dimensional space.
Bastard!
We've discovered many magnetic fields similar to Noah's.
Who do you think you are?
"Look, Doc said when I finish, I could go."
That was the deal.
"The deal was you fix the road, not make it worse."
"Now, scrape it off!"
Start over again.
"Hey, look, grandpa, I'm not a bulldozer."
I'm a racecar.
Oh-ho-ho-ho!
Is that right?
Then why don't we just have a little race?
Me and you.
- What?
- Me and you.
That a joke?
"If you win, you go and I fix the road."
"If I win, you do the road my way."
"Doc, what're you doin'?"
"I don't mean to be rude here, but you probably go zero to sixty in, like, what?"
Three-point-five years?
Then I reckon you ain't got nothin' to worry about.
"You know what, old-timer?"
That's a wonderful idea.
Let's race.
"Gentlemen, this will be a one-lap race."
"You will drive to Willy's Butte, go around Willy's Butte and come back."
"There will be no bumping', no cheatin', no spitting', no biting', no road rage, no maiming', no oil slickin', no pushing', no shoving', no backstabbing', no road-hoggin',"
and no lollygaggin'.
Speed.
I'm speed.
"Float like a Cadillac, sting like a Beemer."
"My friend Guido, he dream to give a real racecar a pit stop."
Can you copy up on top?
Anybody copy?
Come again?
Just making sure We can communicate.
How am I looking?
I should be headed Right towards the beach.
"Yeah, you're about 20 to 40 Feet Past where you were before."
"Far from the boat, Shawn is truly on his own."
"Come on, shawn."
Here's a big boulder.
"It's a big, big rock."
I like big rocks.
Here we go.
"Come on, keep it up."
"Come on, let me see it."
I've been in nome About five years.
It was my dad's Get-rich-quick idea.
So we're sitting in hawaii.
"Everything was cool In my happy little life,"
And I had my own Painting company.
"He's like, ""Yeah, We just got to pump dirt."""
"And we'll get rich, And we'll come back here,"
"""And we only have to work Six months a year."""
"At that point, I was already."
A master painter Living a great life.
"So looking back, you have To be very selective."
On who you get ideas from.
100 miles east of nome...
Here's a big boulder.
"Determined to keep His gold empire from failing,"
Shawn pomrenke is going For broke at the bluff.
Here I'm seeing Some much better color.
"Hey, hey."
What the...?
And we needed to find us some shelter.
This is my turn to tell a story.
"Hey, hey."
The kindly innkeeper was warm and friendly.
She made me feel all bubbly inside.
My trusty sidekick here would love to freshen up.
- Sidekick?
- And I would love some waffles.
- We are equals.
"- Oh, man."
Of course we are.
The noble donkey reassured his clearly inferior sidekick.
I'm getting a little tired of this.
"But before Puss could finish his thought, he decided to take a well-deserved tongue bath."
What the...?
"Well, as long as I am here."
"But right then, danger came from behind."
And Puss was never seen again.
The end.
No!
That is not how the story goes.
I was well aware of the approaching danger and went for my steel!
"Don't worry, little buddy."
I'm here to save you.
"Oh, you're killing me."
It was Prince Charming.
He was packing heat and he wanted revenge!
- I want revenge!
- He said.
But before anyone could do anything...
I'm sure of it.
When?
"- Why, have faith, ladies."
Hold fast.
Look at this.
It's for the Women's Institute.
"Oh, yes?"
"Oh, it does sound good."
Mr Farrow?
Mr Farrow.
What's this?
"Women of Great Paxford, join us for a harvest of blackberries for the purpose of making jam."
"""For the purpose of making jam."" Why not just say, ""to make jam""?"
They know how to make it sound better.
Bollocks.
- Unlike you.
This will be a small part of our planned contribution to the nation's food supply in the event of war and a re-launch of the village Women's Institute following its recent closure.
ALL welcome.
"""All"" in capital letters."
What do you reckon?
"- What, baking cakes and arranging flowers?"
It's not for me.
- This doesn't mention cakes or flowers.
"But it does say ""all"" in capital letters."
Not for me.
You should go... for the purpose of getting out more.
"Leave it, Stanley, all right."
Move out...
- Right.
When The Saints Go Marching In
"♪ Oh, when the saints go marching in"
"♪ Oh, when the saints go marching in"
This has nothing to do with me.
"It is about you, and it is always about you."
- Put your hands behind your head.
- Don't say anything.
I'll follow you to the station.
Do you think I did the right thing...
cutting my hair?
I can't believe this about your grandfather.
He's in big trouble.
"Yeah, I know, with the creek and the no paddle."
"Damn Oregonian barbers, man, making my head too small for my body."
- How do you work with this mirror?
"- Grandpa, front page, jail?"
- I was in that photo.
"I got cut out, though, ... probably 'cause of my hairdo."
- Sorry to see you're so upset.
- I'll survive.
It'll grow out.
- I'm talking about Caleb.
Looks like someone was way off base.
Accusing you of making everything about you.
"- My God, she is right."
"- I was just kidding, man."
"No, dude, here I am, going on and on about my haircut."
My grandfather's in the cooler.
"I'm like a monster, dude."
"I'm all I think about, and not in a good way."
- There's a good way?
- Talk to me about anything other than me.
"Go, give me anything."
"- Ah, here it is."
First day of A.P. Physics today.
"It's OK, Tom, we'll get you to the hospital."
Are the paramedics still here?
Get the ambulance back!
Tom?
I don't wanna go.
You have to.
I don't wanna go there.
We just need to get you to the hospital and they'll be able to help.
I don't wanna die alone.
I'm afraid.
Someone called an ambulance?
I think it's time you took a sickly.
Let's see if we can get you more comfortable.
Don't be afraid.
All that struff about the resurrection.
About there being something else after this.
Do you believe it?
Don't say that you do to make me feel better.
I believe...
that you shouldn't be afraid.
Hi I'm here to see Victor Alexander.
"You're his daughter, yes?"
Yeah.
Your father left us yesterday.
What?
He's been released.
He didn't tell you?
No.
Failed to mention it.
So this is the cause of all the trouble.
Expecting something more impressive?
It's amazing what a collection of flesh and bones is capable of.
What did you bring in?
- A high school kid in short pants that had a twitch.
"- Oh, Christ."
You grab a bellhop because he's got three joints in his sock.
"Walt, we got the information there's no shit on the street, right?"
It's like a goddamn desert full of junkies out there.
- Everybody waiting to get well.
- Goddamn it.
This could be it.
This little candy store guy...
He's puttin' on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known narcotics connections.
They were all over him.
"And then, on our own, after working a whole day and night... we tail him to Brooklyn, and we sat on him for practically a week."
"Now, who do we come up with?"
"Joel Weinstock, for Christ's sake."
"Now, you gotta let us have it."
Do you believe all this crap?
I go with my partner.
- What'll it take?
- A wire.
- No.
Two wires.
- Two wires.
"One on the store, one on the house."
"You know I have to get a court order for a wiretap, don't you?"
But you'll try.
"We know you can do it, Walt."
[Chuckles]
Popeye.
You still pickin' your feet in Poughkeepsie?
[Chuckles]
[Man Speaking French]
"They're still in your drawer, unsigned."
No!
I know very well that I...
I could have sworn I signed these.
Why didn't you remind me?
I did remind you.
Several times.
And there are at least three memos on your spike.
I must have overlooked it.
"See that they're mailed immediately, and attach a letter of apology."
Certainly.
"Well, what is it?"
"I hate to mention this, but the safe was open again this morning."
I distinctly remember locking it last night.
Maybe it was...
"No, I checked it."
There's nothing missing.
It wasn't a burglar.
Then it was somebody in the office.
"John, you're the only one who has the combination."
"Good evening, Ellen."
"Good evening, sir."
I lost my keys.
"Well, you left them on the table this morning, sir."
Here's John now.
I was sure I put them in my pocket.
You promised you'd be home early!
"Good evening, John."
"Oh, hello, Sam."
I was so busy I didn't notice the time.
"Why, are you working too hard?"
"Oh, no."
I can't figure out.
It's some kind of a code.
Code.
Jerry.
Have you been paying your bills?
Well...
I've moved around a lot.
"I haven't had a lot of consistent bills, per se."
But you have a checking account.
You've had one since you were a kid.
mething due on the tenth.
You think Marla and Walker are in on it together?
Marla was telling the truth about wanting to sell Gus' work.
Maybe Walker had money troubles.
Stole his own artwork to sell it on the black market.
So he'd cut Marla out of her share?
What do we know about Walker's background?
Anything out of the ordinary?
Not so far.
(Angela) I know Walker's lying about something.
"Let's take a closer look at him, okay?"
It's funny--
"(Leo) Oh, boy."
Here we go.
What?
"Every time you start a sentence with, ""It's funny,"""
you're about to segue into a story about Dana that has absolutely nothing to do with what we're talking about.
That's not true.
"Okay, that's true."
And you've been dressing nicer for the past week or so.
Is that a new shirt?
"Yeah, Dana picked it out for me."
You just tell the little guy to wear it well.
And feel free to bring him in whenever you want.
"But, you know, call first."
"This is a place of business, for God's sake."

"Go, go!"
I'm leaving.
See you tonight.
"Tail-hair, follow me."
"Don't you understand, idiot?"
Come on!
"Come on, hurry up!"
You silly fool!
I could have sliced him for good!
Come on!
Oh!
Toulouche!
What is happening?
"Go back to sleep, you!"
Have you embarked the counterfeit money?
Yeah.
"For this, no problem, but this damned reporter, this Fandor, he was walking in the main sewer."
"I was going to slice him for good, but this idiot, he threw him in the river."
"With any luck, he drowned."
Not a chance!
He swims like a fish.
Why did you save his life?
What do you reproach me?
What innocence!
He always forgets everything.
It's really not smart to have him introduced in the gang.
I do what I want.
"If it's not in your taste, you can remove your printing presses from my cellar."
For what I earn on your output...
Besides he renders services.
His brain is full of holes like a strainer.
No.
Fredo's in the house with Mama.
He asked for you and Tom said you wouldn't see him.
That's right.
"Kids, why don't you go outside for a while?"
"Please, I want to talk to you."
"Michael, I hated you for so many years."
"I think I did things to myself, to hurt myself, so that you'd know"
that I could hurt you.
"You were just being strong for all of us, the way Papa was."
And I forgive you.
Can't you forgive Fredo?
"He's so sweet, and helpless without you."
You need me.
I want to take care of you now.
Connie.
"Tom, sit down."
"Our friend and business partner, Hyman Roth, is in the news."
-Did you hear about it?
-I hear that he's in Israel.
The High Court in Israel turned down his request to live there.
"His passport's been invalidated, except to return here."
He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday.
He offered them a million dollars if they'd let him live there.
-They turned him down.
-He's going to try Panama.
Panama won't take him.
"Not for a million, not for ten million."
His condition is reported as terminal.
He's only got six months left.
He's had the same heart attack for 20 years.
-That plane goes to Miami.
Why are you making us struggle?
You should have said it from the beginning.
This is great.
What are we going to do about Turan and his gang?
They've been... watching us closely for a very long time.
Who?
These guys?
Excuse me!
What are you looking at?
Give me that ball.
"Come on, get out of here!"
"Yes, is there anything else?"
"Then we are all in, aren't we?"
"Why are you asking me, dude?"
I am already in.
You were the ones who were waiting for Mert.
Her you go.
He's here now.
You've been on my case since I came.
"You're angry, so I am not saying anything."
- Who are you to say anything anyway?
"- Gamze, it's enough."
"Look, it's more important for me than anyone else here to finish school."
Okay?
You won't understand this.
"So, don't drag it out."
Let's get down to business if the old issues are over.
"Kaan, you are the only one who could plan this whole thing."
"Dude, I've never done anything shameful in my whole life."
Alright?
"But my family is calling me a ""shameless man."""
"Okay, I was really angry the other day."
"She ran away from the home and me, you know?"
But I didn't give up!
I have brought her back!
"And that, too, after she has a child!"
I see... but how did you accomplish all this?
One has to apply his mind for the children's welfare.
One cannot live on love alone.
One needs money.
One needs comforts...
"And luxuries, too."
What happened?
My heart...
Janki!
Janki!
I want a truck-load of flowers.
Have the house washed...
Have the boss's white attire ironed.
And I want 200 kgs of ice...
That's a must!
We'll lay the boss's body on that... or his body will stink till his brother arrives from Nepal.
He must be given a National Hero's farewell!
He is leaving us so much!
I'll ask his daughter and let you know more.
Hang on.
What happened?
Everything is fine.
Call off everything!
Bless aunt!
The worst could have happened if she had not rushed you here on time.
She carried you all the way as if you were a child!
"You ought to take part in the Olympics, aunt!"
India would be assured of at least one gold medal.
Don't you recognize me?
"In any case, you know that the only real pictures are childhood photos."
What is this picture?
It's an eminent Victorian in a hollywood bed.
There's a special effect here...
The bed appears twice.
"Yes, I made the bed even more hollywood-ish by doubling it."
"I prolonged it, to show this curve."
To make it even more victorian.
"It was taken in London, in a hotel room."
And who is this person?
My husband.
It was taken in London?
"In London, in january."
"At night, as you can see."
This is my friend of mine.
"Whom I photographed here in Paris, nearby actually."
I took off the part I wasn't interested in.
This person is also in a bed?
"No, he was layed back in a couch."
Layed back...
"But he seems floating in a bathtub, no?"
"Yes, yes."
"In the water, in a pool."
He holds a glass of tequila.
I gave him some...
In order for him to relax.
"It worked just a little bit, actually."
I have never seen this one.
This was taken more or less a year ago...
In Montfort I'Amaury.
Actually I wasn't the one who took the picture.
Checkmate.
Oh really?
Take care of him.
He's getting picked up in two hours.
"Okay, I see."
I appreciate it.
"Say, could you tie this?"
I knew that he had a screw loose somewhere.
Who would have thought he has such difficulties?
Wouldn't it be better if I call the police?
No!
Give Bulle a call.
He should pick him up.
"Say, could you put that gun away?"
"It's making me nervous, that thing in your hand."
"When I get nervous, I can't stop talking."
- Everybody has problems.
"Tell me, this isn't that Pope troupe?"
Pope dancers.
"It'll be great, I promise."
Background for Nora.
Hopefully not this hip-hop shit.
Don't worry about it.
It'll be great.
"Next time, you change your shirt."
Chic!
"Recently, my neighbor has been leaving her trash in front of my door."
She said that she didn't notice.
"The fact that it fell over, and brown sauce dripped all over my carpet..."
"She didn't notice that either, right?"
"She said, that she didn't do it on purpose."
And that's just not nice.
To the contrary.
Come... come...
"But, Professor, we haven't finished."
Can't you see that I have things to do?
I have a lot to do.
Aren't you going to report them to the Academic Senate?
Won't you expell them?
- I'll think about it.
- How magnanimous.
"I'll make you pay for this, or my name isn't Cicchirini."
- We're innocent.
- You're a bunch of fools!
We're what?
Are you really going to report them to the Academic Senate?
Of course not.
That was just a joke.
"When I was young, I was worse than them, my dear Ms. Cappia."
"Cappi, Professor."
I just wanted to make sure that nothing would happen to me.
Nothing yet...
Professor!
What are you doing?
"You haven't heard of the prowess of ""Professor Saw-Saw""?"
I couldn't breathe!
It makes me not want to have sex.
I need breath mints?
"No, darling, but I'd be more comfortable in your home."
It's warmer and more relaxing.
- But it's much more romantic here.
- Alright...
Don't make a sound.
Who's there?
Lucy has remembered something else.
She's downstairs?
I thought you took her home last night?
She couldn't get in.
The bloke who attacked her took her keys.
So she crashed in the soft room.
What's wrong with a hotel?
She didn't feel safe on her own.
It was only for one night.
I hope so.
We're not running a BB.
There was one of those beaded cushions on the front seat of his cab and he wore a leather jacket as it squeaked against the beads.
That's great.
"Thank you, Lucy."
"Thanks for letting me stay, Detective."
That's no problem.
And it's Sam.
First-name terms?
Eh?
What?
She's one of us.
One of us?
She works in pay roll.
For forensic services.
"She's a victim, Sam."
Even if she is blessed in the looks department.
Really?
I hadn't noticed.
Not much.
"I'll get the warrant for the taxi driver, shall I?"
Argh!
"Carl Lucas, I'm arresting you on suspicion of... murder, robbery and attempted rape."
Who were they?
We couldn't find out...
Do you have any idea?
I do.
Some migrants probably just felt threatened.
It's not worth the worry.
Prince Daeso will be furious.
Keep quiet.
"Yes, sir."
"Since you killed Jumong, I'll give you the reward I promised."
One states your new title as a noble.
The other states your new estate.
"Come on, take it."
I'm honored.
Bubunno.
Yes?
I'll appoint you as Vice Commander.
Help Naro prepare for the war.
You're familiar with Jolbon... so organize the spies and think of ways to strike the enemy.
I will.
Eupru is a few hours away.
A man named Buwiyum is head of the pirates now.
But we don't know where he lives or what he looks like.
"Gosh, I'd rather look for a needle in a haystack."
"Commander, what should we do now?"
Do you know your way around Eupru?
"This is Sanchun, Magok and Geodu."
I'm sure the pirates trade their loot.
We should ask the merchants in the area.
I've done business in Sanchun and Magok before.
I'm sure they'll help us.
"I'll go to Magok with Oi, Mari and Hyupbo."
- She sounds like a duck.
"Smells like one, too."
"Oh, 'cause I thought he was asking you to explain how his penis worked."
What?
"Yeah, so, uh, Dennis went to my dad-- my dad's a really famous doctor-- and my dad had to show Dennis a book on how to fix his broken penis because he was too stupid to figure it out on his own."
Shut up.
"Yeah, that's probably why you phoned three grades, Dennis."
You're always gonna have to rely on the smart people to explain things to you.
Smart people like my dad.
- Are you feeling ready for this?
- Yes.
***
Start with the arms.
"When he's feeling comfortable, rub his arms again before moving on to his chest, and so on, and just keep building up from there."
"I know, Dr. Masters."
We've been over it a hundred times.
Hi.
- How are you?
- Nervous.
***
"I'm gonna take off my robe now, okay?"
Okay.
"Um, I'm just gonna follow your lead."
Sorry.
It's okay.
Just remember the whole point of today is to make you feel good.
That's nice.
- Really nice.
- Good.
"I'm gonna move on to your chest now, okay?"
Okay.
"Although... if you wanted, you could move a little further than that."
The prodigal son came for a visit.
You shouldn't scare an old man.
How's daddy?
You've lost weight.
I thought I'd do some visiting.
"-Go ahead, I have work to do."
"Visit you, I mean."
Didn't you used to smoke these at Christmas?
It was a different brand.
Are you still working on your thesis about shopping bags?
That's why we moved here.
Twenty years ago.
Don't touch them!
It's my research material.
What do they tell you?
They correlate with the changes in the gross national product.
Don't laugh.
Kids flush them down the toilet.
Which sewer do you dig to find these?
The one at the waste water purification plant.
What brings you here?
-Doctor's orders.
Are you seeing a shrink?
The other option was to see the monkeys in the zoo.
I should get these calculations done.
You're getting bald.
"No of fence, dad."
Jesse!
Marjukka told us what you did.
-Garbage Jesse!
Is he the one who saved the children?
"He's the man, Garbage Jesse!"
Tell your father that they're coming back around.
He's been shot.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
"You know what to do, right?"
"Keep pressure on the wound, and there should be some morphine syrettes in the, uh, supplies I gave you."
"Yeah, we've got it."
"Listen, Jake."
People are gonna be looking to you now.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
"Okay, the guys will be back."
They retreated to Talbot's farm.
"My guess is, they're waiting for reinforcements, so you should have a little time to regroup out there."
"Just keep the radio close, and I'll update you."
Out.
Out.
"Um, please, I need a doctor, whoever's in charge."
Right over there.
"Excuse me, sir?"
Colonel Hoffman.
"You don't have to call me sir, not unless you plan to enlist."
There's a city called New Bern.
It has a munitions factory.
It's planning to overrun the town of Jericho.
People are gonna get killed.
"They tried to kill me, but I got away."
You've got to help these people.
Where is this?
"Kansas, not far from the Colorado border."
I wish I could help.
My orders are to secure the roads in this area.
What she said about the Nazis and the rest made me sick.
My father...
"Was scared of her, totally under her thumb."
"It was her place, you see."
"No, you have no idea what it was like living here."
It's always the same.
"If you had read Freud, you'd know how much damage your parents do to you."
It starts...
Even before you're born.
"Ah, yes, you read, uh..."
Yes.
I wanted to study psychoanalysis.
I wanted to go to university.
They wouldn't let me.
"Well, Stanley, lying is never very clever, but lying to a police officer is a very serious offense."
I'm not lying.
Everything I've told you is the truth.
Mr. Ellis?
Yes.
"How are you feeling, Mr. Ellis?"
Can you tell me what happened?
You don't know?
"Well, you didn't leave a note."
No.
Whisky and a sleeping draft-- it's fairly evident you tried to take your own life.
Why was that?
Isn't it obvious?
Not to me.
People had the wrong impression about Peggy.
"She was a strong woman, opinionated."
But they don't understand.
I'd been married to her for 22 years.
MAN:
"Well, where does the [inaudible]?"
"Yeah, you got to-- you can't do that, right?"
"Hey, you guys can't do this stuff"
"Until he's wrapped, right?"
I'm the director.
I'm the boss.
Don't wrap until you get the word directly from the top.
I'm sorry if you were misinformed.
It obviously was a boo boo.
"And again, I'm grateful."
"It's the best makeup we've ever had,"
The best Toxie we've ever had.
But there might be some major miscommunication.
"And if it happens, it'll be a four-hour wait."
"So please-- this didn't matter, this one."
"But please just check first, right?"
"Please, please, please."
"Tox-- uh, David, thank you very much."
It was a wonder day.
Are you satisfied?
Everything all right?
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
But you're OK?
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
We can't do any better.
We cannot do any better.
I can't make the movie any other way.
This is the best-- this may be harder than most of the days.
I don't know.
But the only good-- the only thing I can suggest
"Is when we're outdoors, we only have so much daylight."
Okay.
"Um, well, I'm not sure about this costume."
I think it's hot.
Thank you.
"I'm Jenna, by the way."
"Ms. Moroney, I got the hemorrhoid cream you wanted."
It's for my face.
"Well, wherever you're putting it, I think it's working."
"You know, I don't-- I don't think you'd like it."
"'Cause we work a lot of hours, and it's live TV, which is risky."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
I like risky.
"See, me and you, we play the game."
We know how to be acceptable.
"Hello, great meeting."
"I drink coffee, please."
This show is our chance to break the shackles.
'Cause the white dudes want to see us fail.
What white dudes?
All of 'em.
"Jack Donaghy, General Electric, George Bush, Karl Robe."
"Karl Robe, you say?"
Affirmative action was designed to keep women and minorities in competition with each other.
To distract us while white dudes inject AIDS into our chicken nuggets.
That's a metaphor.
Sure.
You should tell that to Us Weekly.
"Hey, Lemon."
You like karaoke?
I know a joint.
"No, no, I-- I gotta wrap up this lunch meeting, Tracy."
I'll take you.
"I was ready to earn an academy award nomination trying to mask my horror over how badly it sucked, but it's actually pretty decent."
"Thanks, bro."
You mind if I take a crack at it?
"Yeah, knock yourself out, bro."
All right.
"Holy shit, you got skills."
"* Left to look at but what lies inside me, * * my first reality * dude, you go to be in my band, bro."
- That was sick.
"- Count me in, bro."
"- Holy shit, bro."
- What are you guys called?
- Hot lunch.
"- Count me out, bro."
- What?
- Hot lunch?
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
"You know what a hot lunch is, right?"
"Yeah, like salisbury steak, like taco tuesday."
"No, no, it's not like salisbury steak."
It's like a euphemism for a sexual term.
It's like when you're doing a chick and she takes a dump on you.
- No way.
- Yes way.Like a cleveland steamer.
- What's that?
- Same thing.
"Dude, I guess I'm never gonna go to cleveland."
I gotta take a piss.
"Sean, are you all right, dude?"
Yeah.
He don't look too good.
"You think I should, like, make him some tea or something?"
Mama's not really happy.
When are you coming back?
"Yeah, I'm"
"- I'm not sure yet, angel."
As soon as I can.
"Listen, I gotta go."
"I will uh, I'll talk to you tomorrow."
"Bye, I love you papa."
"I love you too, Julia."
"You two, uh, takin' off for the airport?"
Yeah.
You sure you're doin' the right thing?
"I mean, you know, you just met the guy."
"Could be he's only uh, after your money."
"Well, that's okay."
I'm only after his body.
"So, how much longer are you planning on staying?"
I gotta think through some things.
Gonna take a while longer.
Don't forget about me.
Jacob Keane?
I'm Agent Henry.
I'm with the agency you used to work for.
What agency?
We're very impressed with what you did.
I don't know what you're talking about.
The director would like to know if you'd entertain the notion of taking on a certain freelance assignment.
And why would I wanna do that?
'Cause you're a rich man now.
"I already was a rich man, Agent Henry."
You gave the money to Marta.
"After everything, don't you think it's the least she deserves?"
She has a head contusion.
She needs medical care.
"Then admit her upstairs to the medical jail ward, but her husband has a knife wound, and she's under arrest."
Mom?
Do not handcuff her in front of her daughter.
What is happening?
"Tammy, it's okay."
She's traumatized enough.
"Cooper, get her out of here."
No!
I want to stay with mom!
"No, no, no."
"Tammy, Tammy..."
"Everything's okay, sweetie."
I love you.
Mom!
"I love you, sweetie."
I love you.
Tammy.
You want me to give up a hospital bed for a kid with a broken arm?
"She's 11 years old, her dad hit her, she just watched her mom get hauled off by the cops."
"All good material for a country song, but lousy on a medical report."
"You look like day-old dishwater, Coop."
"Why don't you go grab a shower, get some rest?"
You've done all you can here.
"No, she's my patient, and I should've known what was going on."
I could've stopped this.
When are you going to Violet's to get your stuff?
"Oh, Charlotte, come on."
Have you talked to her?
"This is not about Violet, okay?"
"I haven't shaved and my shirt's a little wrinkled, but beneath the depressed hobo look, I am fine."
I'll be careful.
What the hell?
You left me alone in a dance circle.
I was trapped in a ring of clapping strangers who wouldn't let me go unless I busted a move.
I have no moves to bust!
What happened back there?
I don't even know.
What's going on?
Huh?
You've been acting a little strange all night.
You made that comment about still gettin' crazy even when you're a mom.
It just got into my head.
"Then we went into the bathroom to drink,"
- and crazy girls in these crazy dresses...
"- [ Chuckles ] ...about to pound a giant bag of wine, and I saw myself in the mirror..."
[ Laughs ] I only saw the ceiling.
"I was like, glug, glug, glug."
Sorry.
Continue.
I have a baby at home.
"And here I am, in this slutty dress, ready to party my ass off in the bathroom of a bar, acting like..."
Like your mother did when you were a kid?
She was the Ultimate Party Slut.
And that's not coming from me.
That was an actual title she won in Daytona.
You think Adam should back off?
Duh.
"Check the Magic 8 ball, buddy."
[ Gasps ] All signs point to Pete.
- Adam liked Kim first.
"- Well, too bad."
Kim digs Pete.
I'm thinking of a few of you specifically when I say that last part.
"Hey, hey."
Are you at all qualified to be teachin'?
"I never use the word ""teach."" I always say ""instruct."""
Nice try.
"You've made it a point to turn others against me, and I don't understand why."
I've not.
You have.
"And as a result, I'm sad and alone..."
And I don't like it here.
Hello.
Hi.
I read  Obidant.
I really liked it.
I didn't realize it had come out already.
About two weeks ago.
Huh.
"Listen, it's nothing personal, but..."
"I'm really trying to do my best up here, and part of that means not getting involved with anybody in, say, a human way."
"So if you'd like, you could come visit me at my office."
This is not my office.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Please don't act like somebody who doesn't know how to handle themselves.
I don't know what you mean.
Act as though you attend these things all the time.
How?
Feel like you don't want to be here.
Like me.
See how little I wanna be here?
But I very much want to be here.
"Oh, Jonathan."
Are you proud of me?
[Siren wailing]
Hey.
You locate the captain?
No.
Not yet.
"Knocked on his door, no answer."
Checked his car.
It was in his parking space.
Just got the key to his condo from the building super.
Let's do this.
[Groans]
He's down!
Radio for backup.
I'm going to need backup and an ambulance at the captain's residence.
[Door closes]
He's alive.
His housekeeper's not.
He wanted the coins that were stolen from the jeweler.
I told him Farley Kolt had them.
"And he said he found Kolt in Los Angeles, spent three days with him, and was sure he didn't."
You might want to check with LAPD if Kolt's body has been found.
I doubt he left him alive.
"And if he didn't wind up with the coins, who did?"
Maybe he got rid of them before this guy caught up with him.
I don't think this guy thought so.
That's why he's here in Portland.
He had photos of all of us.
"Me, Nick, and you, captain."
They were taken by a private investigator from New York.
His body was found this morning at a downtown hotel.
And we found a camera in the trunk of a rental car.
Downloaded the photos.
Wednesdays?
Goni?
"Come take the stool, sweetie."
What does he need the stool for?
- Why are you taking the stool?
I understood the Russian.
"The stool is mine, I brought it and I'm taking it."
"Goni, we're leaving."
Aren't we waiting for Mommy?
She'll come in a minute.
Why are you taking the magazines?
"When you were a baby, we lived in a small apartment and there was no room for all my things, so I asked Grandma and Grandpa to keep them for me."
Why are you taking them now?
Because now there's room in our apartment.
And we don't need any favors.
"It's okay, sweetie."
Why did you have to do that?
- Because I wanted to.
You do it to spite my mother?
"Yes, I direct little operettas and do things to spite her."
Don't start with that.
"I will start with that, I've had it."
"Do whatever you want, but not in front of the child."
I have no problem with it being in front of the child.
Hi.
Where should I put it?
- Anywhere.
Thanks for bringing everything back.
You're paying.
"- Yes, I'm paying."
There's more.
How do you feel?
But he didn't hang up the phone.
We had to scrub the audio.
"At first, it was quite feint."
Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
"You came back, and you put the jacket in ms murnane's laundry."
1:16 pm.
Resuming interview with eva gundelach.
"Now, eva, I'm going to read back over what you said before lunch about the death of thom murnane."
Do you understand?
"Anything I say that is in correct, please stop me and tell me."
"You said,"
"""it happened the night mum and dad fought."
"They'd fought before, but this time was different."
It was loud and I went to listen.
I heard mum saying she wanted to leave dad.
I'm not going to tell you who it was!
"Ok, you promise me you won't say."
Tell me who it was.
It was Jess.
Jess?
Jess murnane?
You said you wanted to know.
"""I couldn't let mum and dad break up."
Couldn't let Jess murnane ruin our family.
I had to make her leave the street.
She wouldn't stay without her boy.
""" If Jess didn't have thom anymore, she'd go, and leave dad alone."
"""I waited till dad got home."
He went to the door and he came back home.
He came back inside and I waited for him to go to bed.
"Ah, you're kidding, right?"
"No, I'm not kidding, coop."
"It's been a really, really good year, okay?"
"Now you, my friend, deserve a little bonus."
"Ladies, refreshers."
"You're under arrest,"
Mr. Daly.
Get this animal out of here.
"See you later, baby."
"Well, it's about time."
Do you mind telling me
"Why I have been here for over an hour, drinking this swill..."
With no access to a telephone?
"Well, I'll tell you what."
"You can borrow mine, mr."
Enright.
Use it to call your lawyer.
Let him know we're booking you for pandering
And possession of a controlled substance.
And we've got a good shot at tying you in to leslie stoltz's murder.
"Oh, please."
"You people just don't get it, do you?"
"You know, your good friend coop daly--"
He sold you out.
The actions you took led to leslie stoltz's death.
That's felony murder.
"Well, I could just say one little magic word."
What's that?
Car...
Do...
Za.
"The judge is going to toss this case out right away,"
She hasn't turned out yet.
Her life is just beginning.
It's too late to give her any brothers and sisters.
"In your case, I'd say it wasn't."
"If I didn't like you so much, Matt... ."
No use...
"Now, Connie, don't you go proposing to me."
"- For you, doc."
- Excuse me.
Would you like a cigarette?
- Swain speaking.
- Thank you.
I'll be right over.
Speak of babies and they appear.
Mrs. Runkle's in labor.
I'll see you later.
"Thanks, doc."
- Bye.
- Bye.
Doc Swain's always talking about babies.
- They're his stock-in-trade.
- Not a bad subject.
"We teach schoolchildren English and math and history, and yet we neglect what gives them the most trouble in life."
You don't recommend classes in baby-making?
Only in theory.
I intend to initiate a sex-education course in the school.
- Isn't that a function of the home?
- You'd think.
And yet not one parent in 10 does it.
"No, sex is taboo in the home."
And it should be in the schools.
"Where would they learn it, in parked cars?"
I have newspaper stuff after school.
But no later than 6:00.
- We'll go out to eat after?
- Anyplace.
It's on me.
You don't have to do that.
You're a graduate.
You get to be pampered.
Then I'd like to go to Chateau Jean Georges La Jean Georges in Paris.
I'll look it up in Daggit and book the Concorde.
I got to go.
I got to get ready.
"Wait, I wanna see my little graduate one more time before the big event."
Do I look like I'm ready to make my way in the world?
"If all else fails, you can marry rich."
I love that we always have that option.
What'll you do with your hair?
I got the curling iron warming up.
"Mom, the cap."
"You put it on, it's gonna smoosh the curls down."
- You are a genius.
- See you tonight.
"Try to seat us next to a celebrity on the Concorde, like Sting or someone."
I'll try.
"- I told her, 'Look, missy... '"
- You called your advisor 'missy?
'
It was attitudinal.
"I said, 'I'm not taking AP Calculus from Henemen."
I'm going with Branch.
"'Branch is a graduate of MIT, and Henemen went to Berkeley."
"'He may have majored in Math, but what did he minor in, bean sprouts?"
These Jew broads got alotta money.
Maybe the family owns the whole fuckin' block.
"You're liable to end up with a big fuckin' score here, ya motherfucker."
See!
You with your fucking mouth!
"I had a meeting with Tuddy around 11:00, and here I am a backup guy for Tommy."
Did you have enough to eat?
It was delicious. I'm just watching my diet.
Let me watch your figure.
I couldn't wait to get away.
I was ordering the dessert when they were eating dinner.
"When they were having coffee, I was asking for a check."
Have some coffee. lt'll wake you up.
"Joe, can we have the check?"
What are you doing?
-l got to go.
"-Go where, Henry?"
We just got here.
I got that thing.
I gotta go.
"Alright, wait a couple of minutes and we'll all leave together."
"Ok, this way you don't go out like a bunch of hobos, staggerring out one at a time, eh?"
I couldn't stand him.
I thought he was really obnoxious.
He kept fidgeting around.
"You don't mind, do you?"
That's very annoying.
"Good, huh?"
"You'd probably do alot better with Manischewitz, but it'd look funny on my table."
-Ready?
"-Henry, lighten up..."
We just got here.
"Every time my mom receives a paper, she tells me to get my dowry ready."
Is she nuts?
"That's exactly what my father says, and that's when the fighting starts."
"Whatever, if everyone agrees, let's sneak into the materials room and get the answer keys for the rest of the weeks, which will put an end to it."
What's the plan?
First the keys.
"Rafet has one of the keys, and Seyfo has the other one."
Seyfo has one key chain that has all the keys in it.
"Gamze, Seyfo is a big admirer of yours."
"What's up, Seyfo?"
"Hey, welcome Gamze."
I'm going to get some ice-cream.
I'm burning from inside...
I'll give you it.
Which one do you want?
Don't bother.
"I'll get it, but it's locked."
"Can you throw me the keys, Seyfo?"
"You continue your work, Seyfo."
"Hey Seyfo, are you ok?"
Thank you.
What's up?
Can you give me some water or something?
I am thirsty.
There's no water.
Drink from the fountain.
But the selling still continues.
Gamze is getting an ice-cream there.
What the hell is this?
Are you planning a robbery or what?
Of course not.
It's the key to the girls' locker room.
- That was funny.
Remember how much fun we had because we weren't outside for once?
And we were just all girls for once.
- It was the only day off that I had.
- I know.
That was great.
It was the only day I could kind of walk around.
- What'd you do that day?
- I slept late because I was on the weird night schedule.
So I slept basically half a day away.
And then got up and maybe got some food or something.
I think I hung out with my friends.
"If you really wanna know, she actually supported our music and our band when nobody else did, not that that's any of your business."
"- Okay, forget it."
I can't do this.
- Do what?
Just make a U-turn and take me back to Ludlow.
I'll find my own way.
- Perfect.
- I refuse to be the goodie bag at your party.
- You don't have to yell.
It's not a train station.
We're in a car.
- Just drop me off.
- I will.
"Oh, my God!"
Are you crazy?
"Mike, is this the night somebody confused you for...?"
- Denzel.
- Denzel Washington.
"- That's right, that's the night."
- What do you mean?
Is that regulation?
I didn't know you government chaps carried those things.
Just beginning to filter through the Wooster brain that you're not government chaps.
"An amazing piece of detective work, Mr. Wooster."
"Here, sit down."
What are you doing?
"- Boss, you all right?"
- I don't know yet.
"From now on I shall hate ""The March of the Hussars. """
"Oh, we can't get out there."
Let's try here.
"Now, come on."
Come on.
Hurry up now.
I'm sorry to have messed this up.
I had no idea these people were thieves.
It seems you had no idea of anything.
"If it hadn't been for you, these men would be in the hands of the police."
- I'd do anything on earth to make amends.
- It's too late now.
- I'm not so sure.
- They match perfectly.
- These are the complete plans.
"- Well, I'm ready to leave."
What the—
- What's that?
"- Somebody playing games, probably."
They've got the plans.
Call everyone in the place.
Stop them!
"- Mr. Wooster, sir."
"- Jeeves, what are you doing here?"
At last you've come to your senses.
Sorry.
Ah.
Do it the way you did it last time.
"Something that makes me look a little younger, please."
You always look young to me.
Perhaps I should chop it all off like you.
Except that I'm not that crazy.
"Aurora, surely you can afford a dress by now."
I've got used to trousers.
They're comfortable and I can move around.
Can you feel that draught?
It comes straight through that wall.
"I've told you before, Mama."
Don't stay here.
- Come back with me to Nohant.
"- No, I want to be in Paris."
"Besides, you don't need my company."
You have that young man.
What's he called?
Malle...
Malle...
- Mallefille.
- Mallefille!
- A very dashing fellow.
- I wish he'd fall off the map.
"You're always looking for something better, Aurora."
"If you'd stayed married, you'd have money."
- You shouldn't beg for scraps like I did.
- I'm doing fine.
The only money I ever saw was what your grandmother paid me not to see you.
You didn't have to take it.
Did he say that he loved you?
He had another woman there.
"Oh, tits."
"According to Dyson, we are only going to have sex when I need to heal."
But there was something there.
"I saw it, man."
"- God, he totally led you on."
"- It is not a big deal, okay?"
Let me go back to sleep.
I have the flu.
- Bo.
- Kenzi.
Kenzi.
"Bo, that disgusting feeling churning in your guts, that's not the flu."
"That's rejection, honey."
"Oh, my God."
"You have never been rejected before, have you?"
I don't know.
- Maybe.
- Okay.
Okay.
I am familiar with you wanting a guy and him not wanting you back.
"And heartbreak sucks, but there are ways to deal and I will show you how."
Or is our little Succubus gonna stay in bed forever?
No.
Okay.
"Telling Dyson how I feel, that was your idea."
This is your fault.
That is why I am gonna be there for you every step of the way.
- Including ice cream for breakfast.
"- Oh, joy."
"Look, dealing with rejection, it can be fun."
Just like falling off a log...
Only further.
Watch the red light.
"Action stations, Number One."
"Come on now, action stations."
"All right, I'll tell you what I'll do."
I'll jump first so I can show you what a piece of cake looks like.
Open doors.
"Sergeant, take over as dispatcher."
Right.
To think we get paid extra for this.
Quite the swindle if you ask me.
Stand by.
Green light on.
Go!
Just like falling off a log.
"Action stations, Number Two!"
"Come on now, any one of you."
"Come on now, this is an order."
Do you hear me?
"If you don't jump now, you'll never make it later."
"Action stations, Number Two."
Take your hands off me or I'll drag you with me.
That's more like it.
"Action stations, Number Three."
Gol
Number Four.
Go!
# Now come sit by my side If you love me
# Do not hasten to bid me Adieu
# Just remember the poor parachutist
# Who is doing his job just for you
Until we know where Balla is.
Do you know how he got here?
Attack them!
Slit their throats!
Kill him!
Murderer!
Subtitles: scalisto for the KG tracker.
- Morning.
- Morning.
What do you want?
What do you want?
How much?
Twenty-four cents.
Cash.
"Don't put him in with any other horse, would you?"
Why not?
It'd just be better.
That'll be extra.
"Put him in with another horse, he's gonna kill him."
That'll be extra for you.
What the hell else does he do?
He can spin in half his own length in crossfire from either side.
"If you drop a dime over in that stall, don't stoop over to get it."
- Get it with your pitchfork.
- What do you keep him around for?
That's a mother-in-law horse.
Know what that is?
A mother-in-law horse is a horse you put your mother-in-law on.
Send them both up in the hills and hope they don't ever come back.
Here's your money.
He just all-around looks after my best welfare.
That was it.
"Alright, keep your eyes open."
"Because they're busting my balls about this bastard, alright?"
"Okay, everybody, let's eat."
I want my money.
I want my money.
He owes it.
"Otherwise, pitch baseball cards."
We gotta real problem.
You know that thing we took care of upstate?
-Paulie was just talking about that.
-We gotta get it outta there.
They just sold the property they want to make it into condominiums.
"-Jimmy, it's been six months."
"-I don't care how long it's been, we gotta get it outta there right away."
"Henry, hurry up."
My mother's making fried peppers and sausage for us.
"-Henry, here's an arm."
"-Very funny, guys."
Here's a leg.
Here's a wing.
"What do you like, the leg or the wing Henry?"
Or you still go for the old hearts and lungs?
"Oh, that's so bad."
What happened to the car?
"I hit a skunk Karen, all right?"
Go with your mother.
"It's disgusting, Henry."
I set up Janice in an apartment around the corner from the Suite.
That way I was able to stay over a couple nights a week.
My new antique lamp.
Karen was home with the kids.
"But how far can you run when you are on a plate, covered in butter, wearing a pink tutu?"
- No!
- And a sombrero!
And a coconut brassiere!
And about to be eaten alive!
No!
Please!
"Please, I'll switch to pancakes."
And the donkey was never seen again.
But what Puss didn't know is that right behind him was the one thing he feared more than anything else.
- No.
You wouldn't.
- I would.
- You didn't.
- I did.
No!
Anything but that!
No!
The end.
I'm pretty sure that's cheating.
"It worked, didn't it?"
Who's next in our little contest?
Has anyone seen the mice?
Are we there yet?
OK.
I think it's time for a story that's actually scary.
"Yeah, whatever."
You had your chance.
Now then.
"Something beyond comprehension was happening to a little boy on this street, in this house."
"A man had come as a last resort, because... no one else would go near the place."
I hear you've been expecting me.
Yeah.
Ella used to hate him.
I can remember she threw his latest novel clear across our bedroom.
She was so angry.
"But, uh, look at you."
You've turned her around.
How'd you manage to do that?
A silent auction.
For charity.
When are you supposed to see Toby?
"Tomorrow, while Jenna's at her music lesson."
- Take it.
- No.
"No, you take it."
The storm has passed.
What was going on with you two?
"Okay, so, you know how I went to that museum with Ezra?"
- Yeah.
"- Well, A tried to get Hanna to ruin it."
Ruin it how?
A gave me another ticket and made me give it to Aria's mom.
"God, Hanna, why didn't you tell us what was happening?"
"Well, I tried to stop it."
"I mean, her mom's car didn't just stall."
"Caleb fixed it to keep from getting there, and that's why I owe him."
He's the one who's been breaking into vending machines at school.
"I mean, he's practically living there."
In school?
"Oh, they found his stuff, so he's not sleeping there anymore."
He's sleeping in my basement.
Wait.
Rewind that a little for me.
"I love you, too."
Bye.
Oh...
I hate lying to my father.
But I am good at it.
"Well, this is a new Alex."
Bad Alex.
Lying-and-sneaking-behind-your-father's-back Alex.
I'm only sneaking around because there's nothing to tell him yet.
"Oh, right."
Nothing to tell.
"What was all that stuff in the hallway, then?"
You two were undressing each other with your eyes.
Were not.
"Come on, you did such a thorough job of it I could see you both naked."
"By the way, he has love handles."
Not from my angle.
"Look at me, I'm like a giddy schoolgirl."
And over what?
One kiss.
What's one kiss?
I'll tell you.
Paris.
I was an art student.
She was a sculptress.
"After one kiss, I was hopelessly in love."
"Oh, I didn't know you were so romantic."
"Yeah, well, the French bitch cured me of that pretty quickly."
She dumped me after the second date.
Maybe I am getting a little ahead of myself here.
"For all I know, he takes every girl he meets on a motorcycle ride."
"Before you stick your neck out any further, you might want to find out exactly where you stand with him."
"Michael, anything."
What can I do?
Settle these troubles with the Rosato brothers.
I don't understand.
I don't...
I don't have your brain for big deals.
But this is a street thing.
That Hyman Roth in Miami.
He's backing up those sons-of-bitches.
-I know he is.
-So why ask me to lay down to them?
It was Hyman Roth that tried to have me killed.
I know it was him.
"Jesus Christ, Mike."
"Jesus Christ, let's get them all."
Now while we've got the muscle.
This used to be my father's old study.
It's changed.
I remember there used to be a big desk here.
I remember when I was a kid.
We had to be quiet when we played near here.
I was very happy that this house never went to strangers.
First Clemenza took it over.
Now you.
My father taught me many things here.
He taught me in this room.
"He taught me, ""Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. """
"If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded in this, in the Rosato brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still good."
That's what I want him to think.
I want him relaxed and confident in our friendship.
Then I'll be able to find out who the traitor in my family was.
-Yeah?
I don't see any dirty footprints.
I think it's safe to assume that our friend didn't stroll in here on his own.
"You look happy to see me,boss."
"Oh,the coffee."
Ran the military id our local leo's got off the body.
Lance corporalames finn.
Stationed at quantico.
Went ua when his unit was shipped to iraq six months ago.
Looks like he's got a pretty good reason for not showing.
Find out where he was buried.
"It won't be far,mcgee."
"Had e trip been longer, some bits would have fallen off."
"Okay,I'll check the backyard."
Scene's not going to skeh itself.
"Perhaps it would be better if you fetched the gurney,Mr. Palmer."
I've seen all I need to see here.
"Yes,doctor."
It's a tidy crime scene.
Quite.
It appears to be a body drop.
"A tertiary crime scene,or quaternary, or quinary..."
I could go on.
"Oh,you did."
It's an odd decorating choice.
Alough the corpse does give the place a certain lived-in look.
You can see he brushed the dirt off his face.
"- Oh,geez!"
- Hello.
Sorry.
Nicrophorus americanus.
"So known as ""the carrion beetle."
""" In here,you little mkey."
I thought you were self-obsessed and spoiled and your teeth were so white it made me angry.
"But then I got to know you, and now I can't imagine my life without you in it."
"Now, go out there and keep talking to her until you find some way to connect."
"I'm sorry, I just can't."
Do you want me to leave?
I can call my caseworker.
No.
I want you to stay very much.
I'm just so bad at this.
I think you're doing okay.
- Really?
- (grunts)
Did you hear what she said?
She thinks I'm doing okay.
I have never once heard that from my daughter.
Hang in there.
"Hey, Violet, it's your mother."
"Just checking in, haven't heard from you in awhile."
"I thought maybe you and Luke might want to come over for dinner on Sunday, unless you broke up with him, in which case, bring the new guy."
"Love you, bye."
Hey.
What's going on here?
Just chilling with my favorite tenant.
(chuckles)
Okay.
"Hi, Beverly."
Mouse.
"You're still gonna wax me, right?"
Yeah.
"So, Jill, how's it going with your foster kid?"
(grunts)
"I'm sorry, what?"
Miss Porter.
- May I ask you something?
- Of course.
- It's about Dr. Cairn.
His methods are...
"I fear that I cannot do what he asks of me, that I will fail him, fail myself."
- Look at you.
Another spoiled rich girl.
So eager to be his pet.
"Yet you come running, crying to me, the moment he pushes you."
- I just thought...
- You thought you'd quit?
Just like every other vapid socialite he's wasted his talents on.
I expect more of you.
Do you understand me?
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.
- You may go.
"- Most of the women here, they're hardly cared for."
Most of them are homeless.
They don't have families.
The doctors here aren't trying to heal them.
They're just keeping them out of sight.
Beats living in the gutter.
At least here... you get fed.
Did something happen with the doctor?
"- No, it's just... his methods are unorthodox."
Never mind.
I shouldn't be speaking about my treatment.
"- Are you all right, miss?"
- I'm fine.
MAUDE:
"Don't fret, honey."
Wherever I go is home sweet home to me.
"Just put that over in the corner, sugarplum."
MARY:
You can put these down.
Thanks.
"Maude, why would that man put his cuff links in your bag?"
"Oh, men are such desperate creatures."
"When they don't get what they want, they do foolish things."
Ain't that the truth.
[wheezing ]
[OBEDlAH coughing ]
[NATHAN sobbing ]
Daddy.
Daddy.
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you too.
I went looking for you after the war.
"Daddy, where'd you go?"
-lt don't matter now.
-What were you doing in that town?
Coming to find you.
"You wanna fill us in, judge?"
A white man was found beaten to death.
He had an altercation with Mr. Jackson in front of witnesses.
After they found the body...
... theystoppedMr.Jackson when he was riding out of town.
"When I realized how angry they were, I moved the trial."
That's why I sent for you.
And they decided to lynch my defendant.
"Daddy, let's ride."
"Perhaps it's a land you'll visit one day,"
"Walking along a frozen river,"
A displaced prince will appear in front of you.
"Well, I hope I never see you again."
"Because you're safe, settled."
Married with children of your own.
I hope the same for you.
"Francis, when you see mary..."
We ran into each other at a chateau outside of...
"Traveled with each other for a day,"
And that is all.
I know you live your life in service to her.
Mary is my friend.
Nothing we did will change that.
That was lovely.
I think you should go now.
Don't do this to yourself.
I won't leave you.
I need to know you're all right.
If it comforts you.
Why do you do it?
"Sometimes, when one is given a gift"
"And worries they've lost it,"
They must return to its source...
The giver itself.
And for me That is death.
Or as near death as I dare to venture.
"Stop it, please!"
The vision...
I wasn't done.
You saw something?
This changes everything.
What the hell are we watching?
Meerkats.
These meerkats are wearing no clothes.
"Give me the clicker, now!"
"OK, fine, but no cooking programs."
Give me the clicker.
She was just scared.
I'm pretty frightening.
"He hated me, Kitty."
Is that what you think?
I could see it.
Always the look of somebody who doesn't expect anything from you.
"Until all you do is disappoint him again and again, but he disappointed me, too."
He loved you with all of his heart.
"They have to love you, it's their job."
"He just didn't know how to show it, to anyone."
"Well, he showed you."
"And yesterday, he showed me what he thought of me."
Now he's dead...and I...
"You know, after you enlisted, he used to call me every day."
"You know, just to talk."
And you know what he used to talk about?
Justin stories.
Great ones.
"He told me that out of all of his children, you were the only one who made him remember what being a kid was."
You were the only one who could do that.
Hmmm...he was so proud of you.
"C'mon, at age 60, you taught him to surf."
He wasn't very good.
"Because of you, he was the only 70 year-old who appreciated ""Death Cab..."
"Curdle."""
Death Cab for Cutie.
All of these tools?
"No, just us tools."
Fine.
"You two, over there."
I'm gonna kill him.
"No, you're not."
You're going to find out who's controlling him and then you're gonna help save him.
No.
"You were right, let's kill him."
Oh...
No.
Kanima.
I was under the impression they were no longer dating.
"Me too, but it looks like they are."
And more.
A lot more.
How do you know it's not some other impressionable young girl...
With severely low standards?
Because I know Scott.
And Allison is the only one that he's ever talked about like that.
I just wanna make sure they continue to be safe.
I couldn't agree more.
Hey.
What if it's Matt?
"I mean, this whole thing comes back to the video, right?"
Danny said that Matt was the one who found the two hours of footage missing.
Exactly!
He's trying to throw suspicion off himself.
"So he makes Jackson kill Isaac's dad, one of argent's hunters, and the mechanic working on your jeep?"
Yes!
Why?
Because... he's evil.
Don't say that.
So... you're a street vendor.
What sort of things do you sell?
"Very kind of you to sit and talk with me, Doctor."
I wanted to ask ―
The others are asking when the cast is coming off my arm.
"It'll get stiff being bandaged too long, won't it?"
That's a powerful hand.
Squeeze.
"Oh yes, very strong!"
"You're a real man, Biberkopf."
- That's right.
"Rotten luck, getting hit by that car."
Your skull was fractured.
We weren't able to save your arm.
You mean my arm is gone?
Well... thanks so much for telling me.
"Well, anyway..."
"You have a tough job too, telling people these things."
All in a day's work.
Now let's see you get back on your feet quickly.
- Tomorrow.
"- No, a few more days."
I can get up tomorrow.
I can only lie in bed for so long.
I have to get back to work.
"Love comes, love goes"
No government can forbid it
A blonde today A brunette tomorrow
Who wants to commit his heart
Take your luck as it comes
It's no shame to enjoy life
Luke?
Um...
I don't know really.
I know.
"Fifth grade, when you two got your mack on, during our class trip, to the Museum of Tolerance back of the bus."
Classy lady.
You know what?
"What's your problem, Cohen?"
"I mean, what did I ever do to you?"
"Nothing, Marissa."
I've lived next door to you forever and you've never done or said anything to me.
"Oh, my God, you're the one who never talks to me."
You think you're so much better than everyone.
I do?
"Well, if you're talking about Luke, then yes, because that guy shaves his chest!"
"Hmm, he plays water polo."
We know--half the team tried to kill us the other night.
"I'm not too popular around here, and your boyfriend--a little bit angry."
You're telling me you didn't try to hit him back?
"Actually, I hit him first."
"Well, hard to believe you're not more popular."
I thought this could be your room.
I still don't know if it's a good idea for me to stick around or not.
You should stay.
Okay... for a little while.
"So when she says it, you listen?"
Hey Summer!
"Oh, hey, hey, hey."
Is that Summer?
Tell her I said happy birthday.
"Coop, where are you?"
We're coming to get you.
Abby and I were getting along so well.
You should stay longer.
"- You know, she would love it."
- I'm sorry.
"Thank you, John."
"I can catch a cab out here, right?"
I'm off in a couple of minutes.
I'll drive you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Dr. Kovac.
Dr. Meyers.
Please.
"So, what brings you here?"
Dr. Weaver.
She told me to come.
"Well, why do you suppose she wanted us to meet?"
- You tell me.
"- Well, that's not quite how it works."
"Hey, you' re a doctor."
"Someone comes to me with a problem, I tell them how to fix it, so..."
- Let's start with you telling me-
- My problem?
What's on your mind?
My family died during the war in Croatia.
So I came to America.
"I had a relationship with someone I cared about, which I then ruined."
So I started to look for the answers in the wrong places.
"You know, like sex, drinking, living fast."
"I killed a patient I should have saved, then I almost killed a medical student in a car crash, so- Woke up one morning and everything I thought I had was gone."
Gone or broken.
"So, what do you have for that?"
"-I do love you, Jess."
-I hope so.
"Darling, let's have dinner at home tonight, just the two of us."
"Oh, we're supposed to go to a party at the Lees'."
"Well, we can drop in for a few minutes, later, when you're getting bored with me."
"If we wait for that, we'll never get there."
Get some sleep.
"You, too, darling."
Just a minute.
"Come in, Josephine."
Mrs. Lee is here.
"Oh, how nice."
"Show her into the library, please."
I'll be down in a minute.
"Yes, Mrs. Bourne."
-Helen.
-Jessie.
It's good to see you.
Very good.
"How are the children, and Owen?"
And what are you doing out in the world so early?
"The children are devils, Owen's an angel, and I'm here to remind you of our party tonight."
-Coffee?
"-Yes, thank you."
Is the party about anything?
"Have I forgotten a birthday, or an anniversary?"
No.
"Strictly business, and bound to be awful."
"Some ex-cop has written a book Owen wants to buy for the paper, so this party is to dazzle the poor fool into signing away the syndicate rights."
"His name's Dwyer, Mark Dwyer."
He gets in from Europe today.
We'll drop in for a few minutes after dinner.
Yes.
"Now, I must warn you, the retrovirus is still experimental."
"In fact, it's only been tested on cell cultures in a laboratory, and so far, without much success."
I'm hoping that what we can learn from your daughter will help me perfect it.
We've got a problem.
Why didn't you just radio me?
"Yeah, well, I could've, but... this way."
Looks like they decided to join the hunt.
"If they find Ellia, they'll kill her."
"Sheppard, this is McKay."
"What is it, Rodney?"
"The villagers are on the move, and it doesn't look like they're going to a picnic."
Are they heading for the caves?
"Not at the moment, no."
All right.
Get back there and sit tight.
"We're losing time, guys."
Ellia?
Ellia?
She's not here.
Good Lord.
What?
She took the retrovirus.
You said it wasn't ready.
"It's not, not by a long shot."
What'll it do to her?
To be honest I have no idea
colonel Sheppard come in.
Go ahead.
We've got another problem.
"Ellia's gone, and she's injected herself with the retrovirus."
Why would she do that?
Yeah.
He's an animal.
And I sorta get the feeling that he's just getting warmed up.
Ouch.
Yeah.
"So, how do I fix it?"
You get a new partner.
"Yeah, I'd like that, but I don't think that's gonna happen."
Well...
I'm seeing a slight tear on the ACL.
"So, you're going to have to stay off that knee for a couple of weeks, physical therapy, and I'll put you on some anti-inflammatories."
"Can I get those, uh, to go?"
Please?
I'll be back.
"Hey, stay."
I'm not a dog.
Stay.
What happened to you?
Oh.
"Uh, I blame you."
"I tore my ACL somewhere in the last few weeks, all the fun we've been having together."
All right.
"Well, once you're done bitching about your boo-boo, I'd love to know what's going on here."
"We got an escaped prisoner, three dead guards."
"Department of Public Safety's trying to figure out what the hell happened,"
Where's Chin and Kono?
"Inside, getting background."
Is that your sister in the car?
"Yeah, I just came straight from the airport."
"You realize if she were a dog, you could get a ticket for leaving her in the car like that?"
"Can we focus, please?"
Yeah.
"It sounds like they're shouting "" pizza."" Are they?"
European fans lik e they're just crazy.
They don't come out in the tens and hundreds.
They come out in thousands.
just wish that could just go along each person and just lik e  chat to them. ith how busy the schedule is it's really frustrating that you can't stop and talk to them and tell them what they've done for us.
"Five minutes, we're on stage!"
One Direction!
One Direction!
"-Three, two, one."
-We push!
"milan, make some noise!"
Thank you so much for having us!
We've been One Direction!
This one's for you.
Thank you.
still get a buzz every time go out on stage.
still come off with  the biggest adrenaline rush.
hen get to  come on the bus and stay up with my mates and laugh about things that we did on stage.
Do you know when I taped you up in the middle of the show with the black tape?
Is that what you did?
"I know, it failed miserably."
You should have just gone with it.
"Thanks for your help, mate."
One girI-
- That is...
-...awful.
-Putrid.
It is absolutely putrid.
Own up.
Own up.
"-Oh, my God."
-Who's farted?
I think he's going to quit his job.
"I'm sorry, Maggie."
I gotta go stop him.
(INAUDIBLE)
"Ted, I had to leave the bar, but it's okay."
I left Maggie with Robin.
You left Maggie with Robin?
Relax.
I've got things under control.
You don't understand the situation.
This girl is like a super-powered man magnet.
"Oh, Teddy."
I know a little something about man magnets.
"You see, your friend may be one of those magnets that can hold up a picture of your kids on the fridge, but I'm one of those magnets that can pick up cars in a junkyard."
- Who's this?
"- Robin, this is Jim, a good friend of mine from work."
"Oh, well, hello there. (GIGGLES)"
- Nice to meet you.
"- Oh, boy."
"What does being ""ready"" even mean?"
"I mean, I thought I was ""ready"" last year."
I wound up getting left at the altar.
"I'll be honest, guys."
I'm a little scared.
"Okay, Louis, then Betty."
"We're all scared, Professor Mosby."
Doesn't being scared let you know you're on to something important?
Yeah.
"I mean, if you're not scared, you're not taking a chance."
"And if you're not taking a chance, then what the hell are you doing?"
Right?
"I think you're ready, bro."
"Well, I don't see how any man could say no to you in that dress."
"Hey, word is Paul Logan's in town."
Paul Logan?
Paul Logan?
Number one host in Macao.
"Yeah, Macao, Monte Carlo."
But not Vegas.
"No, not Vegas."
"Mr. Taylor, if you're missing personal property, we can call security, but..."
"I'm telling you, I ain't payin' for this room, not after what happened to me in there."
Excuse me.
What's going on around here?
There's a ghost in my room.
And she's a thief.
I'm sorry.
There's a what?
She took my money clip right off the nightstand.
"It was silver, with my initials..."
R.P.T.
And there was 400 bucks in there.
You're saying that someone stole your money...
"Not someone, something."
"I get back to my room, and I see this dark-haired woman sorta hovering on my bed."
- Hovering?
"- Yes, hovering."
"Next thing I know, she's gone and so is my money clip."
You oughta comp my stay and reimburse me what she stole.
That's him.
That's the guy who walked out on his check at Mystique.
"All right, you owe her 86 bucks, pal."
Let's go.
Did you intend to pay for any part of your stay here?
- Yeah. you always told Frankie and me that a man is measured by the strength of his enemies.
But you're wrong.
A man is measured by the strength of the love others have for him.
I hope one day you and I can put away the pain and actually talk to each other. your son Brandon.
You're not gonna fucking believe this shit.
the prodigal son returns.
kid.
I take it you got me something.
Not exactly.
Exactly what then?
A business proposal.
Unless this conversation you ain't walking out of here.
Just hear me out.
Sit. plus a whole lot more?
I'm listening.
here's the deal...
Give me a call when you're ready to make some money.
do you?
Why not?
He's as greedy as his brother Frankie was.
follow him.
And another thing-- see if anybody heard anything.
book the fight.
l want to go as far away as possible.
Yeah?
Where would you want to go?
as long as it's sunny and there's water and there's really nice beaches.
We can always take a ride up the West Coast.
Yeah?
That would be amazing.
Hey.
good.
You think you guys won the jackpot?
"We've got news for you, Billy."
We've got your numbers.
"Number, number."
We've got your number.
Numbers?
Will you girls excuse us for a minute?
Thank you.
"So, you guys are old friends?"
No.
No.
We just met at the bar.
Yeah.
I recognized him from TV.
I went over and said hello.
What was your name again?
"Billy, don't bother."
We've already checked.
You guys have known each other for years.
You've worked on five movies together.
I knew I'd seen this logo somewhere before.
"At the press conference, it was on your friend's jacket."
That's the clue that capped the case.
That's not even a real phrase.
"It's all over, Billy."
We know why you killed Marissa Kessler.
The paint we found on her fingertips told the whole story.
"That night after the show, she must have caught you rigging the equipment."
It looks like you painted yourself into a corner.
Randy.
You think I rigged the super jackpot?
That's right.
As you want.
"In the worst moments, Julian used to draw his silhouette with his finger."
He'd repeat it... over and over.
I didn't know what to say.
When you met..
What did Julian say?
We talked a bit about everything.
He told me what happened to him.
And about me?
That you were nice to him.
Nothing else?
"Also, what happened between you two."
He didn't look very affected that day.
It's true.
Shall we leave?
Do I look good?
Very good.
"The day he met you, he came home radiant."
The only important thing to him was that you wouldn't realize how happy he was for seeing you.
Do you know why he chose my poem to compose?
I thought he could've wrote it.
Specially the last verses.
"""And with hands trembling..."""
How was it?
"""With hands trembling by tenderness""."
He said you wrote it thinking of Clara.
Who knows.
I'm sure.
How is she?
I guess she's fine.
You and Clara broke up on time.
I was determined to leave Julian when he'd go out of the sanitarium.
That was a close one.
Too close.
The little tramp!
"Ah, she's better than I thought."
"Well, at this rate, he'll be kissing her by sunset for sure."
"Well, it's time Ursula took matters into her own tentacles."
Triton's daughter will be mine' And then I'll make him writhe.
I'll see him wriggle like a worm on a hook!
Eric?
If I may say... far better than any dream girl is one offlesh and blood... one warm and caring and right before your eyes.
Ariel!
"Ariel, wake up!"
Wake up!
I just heard the news!
"Congratulations, kiddo, we did it!"
Ooh.
What is this idiot babbling about?
"Right, as ifyou two didn't know, huh?"
The whole town's buzzin' about the prince... gettin' himself hitched this afternoon'
"You know, he's getting married."
You silly side-walker.
I just wanted to wish ya luck.
I'll catch ya later.
I wouldn't miss it!
"Well, now, Eric."
It appears that I was mistaken.
"This mystery maiden ofyours does, in fact, exist."
A-And she is lovely.
"Congratulations, my dear."
We wish to be married as soon as possible.
"Oh, yes, ofcourse, Eric, but, uh, these things do take time, you know."
"This afternoon, Grimsby."
I know I threatened you.
"In truth, I'm so glad"
You had the courage to tell me
How their fate had changed.
Yes.
They will be together.
For many years.
"I do this not out of any malice, as you are my son,"
But to ensure peace.
"So that should you return,"
You have seared into your memory
What is yours and what is not.
my baby
wide-eyed pretty you're a body
I can hold
I'm a good man too.
"You're not a very trusting fellow, are you?"
I was a lot more trusting before you took my weapons.
You'll get those back as soon as you leave us.
They say you're a threat to the realm.
But your family wants you safe.
Alive.
Yes.
You're not thirsty?
"I have my own, thanks."
Who paid you to kill me?
The queen or my brother?

"Oh, no."
"Come out, you little pipsqueak, and fight like a man!"

- Ow.
- What are you doing?
"- Well, I was just, uh..."
"- I'm sorry, madame."
- [Huffs]
"You know, Eric, perhaps our young guest might enjoy seeing some of the sights of the kingdom."
Something in the way of a tour.
"[Chuckles] I'm sorry, Grim."
What was that?
You can't spend all your time moping about.
You need to get out.
- Do something.
Have a life.
- Shh!
- Get your mind off...
"- Easy, Grim, easy."
"It's not a bad idea, if she's interested."
"Well, what do ya say?"
Would you like to join me on a tour of my kingdom tomorrow?
Wonderful!
"Now, let's eat before this crab wanders off my plate."
"- [Max barks] - [Whistles] Come here, boy."
- [Barks] - [Eric growls]
"This has got to be, without a doubt, the single most humiliating day of my life."
"I hope that you appreciate what I go through for you, young lady."
"Now, we got to make a plan to get that boy to kiss you."
"Tomorrow when he takes you for that ride, you gotta look your best."
"You gotta bat your eyes, like this."
"You gotta pucker up your lips, like this."
Hmm.
I'm sure.
You gonna be all right?
I'll be all right.
And you?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I think so."
Tell Catherine it brought me luck.
I will.
"I'll be seein' you around,"

"I'm telling you, the government has a car that runs on water, man."
"They just don't want us to know, because then we'd buy all the water."
Then there'd be nothing left to drink but beer.
And the government knows that beer... will set us free.
"Hyde, you told us about the car a million times."
Can we please talk about how hungry and horny I am?
I wish I had a lady made of pizza.
Or a pizza made of boobs!
"Yeah, hungry, check."
"Horny, check."
"It's getting a little old, Fez."
"God, I feel like I'm Luke Skywalker, you know?"
Remember when he was living on Tatooine before R2 and 3PO showed up?
Just workin' on Uncle Owen's water farm all day.
Not even allowed to go into Toshie Station to pick up some power converters.
Boring.
"Eric, enough with the Star Wars crap!"
"Whenever you talk about that stuff, I frown."
"And when I frown, my skin wrinkles."
"And if I get wrinkles, my free ride is over."
And I like my free ride!
I third it.
"All those in favor will please say ""aye."""
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Contrary-minded?
Nay.
You'll get your mop.
Aye.
That makes it unanimous.
Any further business?
Do i hear a motion to adjourn?
Let me do it.
I move we adjourn.
I second the motion.
I third it.
Meeting's adjourned.
"Good night, mr."

We only needed a $1 million issue to cover our stock shortage.
What do you think you're gonna do with the other 9 million?
"If we can get cornele to buy it, we'll give him the licking' of his life."
"It'll take more money than you ever thought of, commodore, to stop that erie flood."
"You bought over $9 million worth of the stuff now, and they still got lots to sell."
"Cornelius, why don't you stop buying and start selling?"
I don't need any suggestions from you to make me a bigger fool than i am.
"If i sell now, the price will drop like a punctured balloon."
"I won't have any money, any stock, or any control."
"Granted I was asleep, but I can feel it."
Something's happening.
And I have almost no makeup on.
"Take a good look around, fat, look at this house, 'cause you ain't comin' back here no more."
"By the way, uh,"
"I'm joining the gym on the Deacon's family plan, so if anybody calls, he's the man I share my life with."
Carrie.
I'm not putting it on!
I'm just looking at it.
It's sparkly.
Ok.
"Darling, let me introduce you to Frank, a.K.A. Mr. safety."
"""Mr. safety""?"
Reading about this recent crime wave made me concerned for your well-being.
"Just sit him on the passenger seat in your car when you go to work, and the carjackers will move on to easier prey."
"Dad, I take the subway to work."
"Well, then, take him on the subway with you."
He has no legs.
Pretend he's an amputee.
"Dad, how is a legless doll gonna protect me on the subway?"
Why are you being so difficult?
I'm trying to save your life!
"Oh, forget it!"
Nope.

Get your heads out of your asses.
We got two frisees... one torn crab- and fire the sweetbreads.
Oops-a-daisy.
I'm sorry.
It seems I got a little enthusiastic with the coulee.
"Well, whilst you're licking things-"
Make it again.
"- I got your back, bro."
- Hmm.
Oh-ho!
Oh!
- [ Popping Sound ] - [ High-Pitched Squealing ]
- What the hell was that?
"- It's called "" the shocker."""
And any of you tools try and touch me again... and you're gonna get one of your own.
"Hey, I'm used to being the only woman in the kitchen... so back off or bend over."
- Oh.
- Raise your hand if you got a semi right now.
Semi-what?
"You don't actually like that thing, do you?"
"Oh, I know."
I wish I didn't 'cause it so fits into the stereotype.
But the truth is this poofy little dog has won my heart.
- I love you.
"- You guys... when my friend Jessica shows up tomorrow, please be gentle, okay?"
"Ooh, what's wrong with her?"
"Oh, does she wear the big shoe?"
"She's not a freak, okay?"
She's just a bit of an outcast.
"You know, could never get a boyfriend."
"She was kind of like my project, my mascot."
I tried to teach her how to be cool.
"Excuse me, you're not supposed to touch that!"
- I beg your pardon?
"- No, I'm just kidding."
"You are Jocelyn, right?"
Alex?
We met at the Couture Birthday Fashion shoot.
"- Oh, yeah!"
How are you?
"- I can't believe these people, man!"
They are nuts!
"What's up with the tooled on that broad, you know?"
"We're doing fashion here, not high art."
I guess she just takes pride in her work.
I need you to fill the water bottles to spray on Resin.
- What?
"- Pierre insists... on the misty look, I need you to put this Evian into the bottles... and practice spraying, now."
"- Yeah, I'll help you."
- That's what he said.
- He said to paint the cow...
- You!
You are the sprinkler?
Fantastique!

Gentle worrying eels just outside Dublin...
"Meteorology: 66 degrees, a crispy October haze on a gray day... the charcoal clouds, they come, yet, back home..."
I'm ready now!
"Okay, okay!"
Let's get this party started now!
I'm not painting that cow!
I don't care!
I told you on the phone I wanted an all-black cow... and you and your make-up people are gonna paint the goddamn cow... all black.
You have to do what I told you...
But first she thought Jennif er was playing a practical joke.
Who's Jennif er?
Who car es?
I was standin' up ther e.
So Natalie blew the call.
"Oh, Natalie blew the call in a big ol' way, yes, but that's not my r eal problem."
I want you to take note right now --
I am not asking you what your r eal problem is.
My r eal problem is that I seem to have made no impr ession on her at all in the elevator.
"And then I was talking to her just now... being cute as a button, thinking that she'd say, ""Hey, listen, I don't --"""
"""Well, as long as you came all the way up her e, how about a date f or lunch?"""
-
- Something along those lines.
-
- Yeah.
"Yeah, but the r eason you went up ther e was to tell her you couldn't go out with her in the first place."
Right now that seems beside the point.
Does that look like he ran the caution?
No.
They'r e moving on the outside.
Yeah.
That's what I thought.
I'm gonna go talk to her again.
Okay.
I'm gonna stay her e and do our job.
Is ther e a message you want me to deliver to Luther?
No message I want you to deliver.
"Isaac, I'm on your team."
"You know, I know you don't think of me that way, but I am a good go-between."
"I don't need a go-between, J.J."
Luther isn't hiding out in the mountains with the r ebel army.
Isaac...
I really do.
"Well, thanks."
How about our going into partnership?
Or do we have to ask John's permission?
He's a charter member.
Do you have any influence with him?
I never interfere in his business.
But you just got a share of it now.
You just became a partner.
"Are you as conservative as your husband, Mrs. Brown?"
No wonder my husband thinks your ideas are too advanced.
I just meant we could make a lot of money.
"Oh, now you're angry again!"
Are you sorry John made you take me to lunch?
I wasn't drafted.
I volunteered.
I shouldn't tease you.
Your sketches are wonderful.
And most women would like to make a lot of money.
Sure.
Some of them marry for it.
That's a low blow.
I'm very fond of John.
I'm sure you are.
"Good evening, Mr. Skinner."
"Hello, Ellen."
"I'm a little early, so if Mr. Brown hasn't finished his dinner..."
He's not here.
He left for Philadelphia late this afternoon.
Well...
"Well, that's odd."
I'm supposed to meet him here to go over some statements.
You did good.
Listen.
You did a great job.
Here you go.
Careful.
It's full.
Okay.
"Paul, I'm-- I'm sorry I'm late."
It's okay.
"I, uh, gave the speeches."
"We're just, uh, waiting on you."
I got MVP.
Is my trophy in there?
I'm sure it is...
somewhere.
"Uh, hopefully, there are trophies for all the players that contributed."
"Okay, Hornets, bring it in, guys."
Come on over.
"Finally, now that the hardware is here, we're gonna give out some awards, okay?"
"And, uh, I'm gonna make you guys suffer through some more boring speeches, and I apologize for that, so bear with me, okay?"
He is so good with kids.
I think coaching's been a real solace for Paul during this time of upheaval.
I think it has.
"We should probably organize something with Joy's other girlfriends, make sure he stays fed, don't you think?"
"Or, you know, I could just... feed him."
It's been two months.
He's hardly wasting away.
"Libby, I'm looking for an excuse."
"You're gonna think I'm terrible, but how long, exactly, does a widower have to wait before he can start, you know... eating?"
I don't know.
A year?
Says who?
They're weirdly popular.
I can order you one.
"Yeah, yeah, why don't you do that?"
"That'd be great, because then they'll get here, in what?"
9 weeks?
"Which is just in time for my daughter's recital, which is tomorrow."
It's the minimum basic requirement that a party store always have Hawaii.
"Children have recitals and their parents, their mothers, can't do it all and we rely on our party store to keep up their end of the bargain so that our husbands and our children don't despise us when we come home empty-handed."
I'll buy the lei.
He's really wrecked.
Usually we like to let this kind dry out for the night in lock-up.
"It reinforces the point, you know?"
"Sure, sure,"
We have driven all the way from Los Angeles.
There's a motel nearby.
See you in the a.m.
Bring coffee.
"All right, thank you."
Thanks.
Hi.
"I'm Justin's mother and this is his big sister, Kitty."
"Kitty Walker, ""The Right Idea"" and ""Red, White and Blue."""
- You're kidding.
- No.
You're her?
"Yeah, I am...me."
Yes.
I love your show.
And we're not asking to be the exception here...
"Yes, we are."
"No, we're not."
- Yes.
"Well, then, do it."
Only this time it's for life.
I'll make sure of it.
"You were never gonna set me free, were you?"
"Don't be so ungrateful, John."
I've even authorised your mobile to make outgoing calls.
"This is freedom, isn't it?"
"Oh, mate."
You're not gonna believe this.
I've only cracked it with one of them Colombian chicks from upstairs.
Big beautiful brown eyes.
"Mate, I have got a strong feeling that before long, Manuela that's her name she's gonna be down here dancing a cumbia on the end of my bed."
Chill out.
No.
Because I've heard it all before.
"No, I can't do this any more, Richard."
"Just leave me alone, OK?"
Sorry.
Don't be.
"Well, other people's rows..."
"Oh, they're great, they're very entertaining."
Especially ones where there's shouting in the street.
"Well, we're done with the shouting."
Is that why you're here?
Yeah.
I left him.
Poor guy.
He messed up.
Stupid guy.
"Well, I like to think of myself as the easygoing type but..."
"Well, there are some things that can never be forgiven."
Tell me about it.
Don't you even care?
I'm not happy at the conservatory.
Of course I care!
"But I also care about scholarships, opportunities."
I care about your future.
"If you really cared about my future, you would not have sold my piano in the first place!"
"Mom, I'm sorry."
I didn't-
"Get in the car, now."
I have to go.
I understand.
I hope you're satisfied.
It took all my will power not to trip her.
Thank you for letting me know Amanda was here.
Glad I could help.
Welcome home.
"I'd ask you what you were thinking, but I don't think you were thinking at all."
"Actually, this took a great deal of planning."
Not helping.
The Blooms' situation was private.
We made it very clear you were not to see Amanda.
You were not to get involved.
"I know I broke a rule, but I'm not sorry I did."
"I had to do it, for Amanda."
"Good intentions aside, you're still grounded."
All of you.
Two weeks.
What?
"School, work, home."
Everything else is off-limits.
And I'll take your cell phones.
This was my idea.
O
What is going on?
What is going on?
Why are they all being so mean?
Being mean here and in the club is no fucking difference than all those fuckers out on the street.
Or anybody else in the goddamn world.
The only difference is out there they all pretend to be nice.
And in here we ain't pretending shit.
What do you mean nobody's pretending?
We're all dressed up like for a masquerade going on stage playing hoodlums.
famous bags.
The biggest eye bags around chicken with the eye bag.
It's just like a three penny
You're too old to model.
Don't make me hate you!
You're so ugly.
And you are so beautiful.
You're the most beautiful boy in the world.
You're the most beautiful boy.
What?
I don't care what you say.
I don't love you.
Margaret what's wrong with you?
Let me see your eyes.
God what eyes.
Chicken woman.
"C'mon, Jimmy!"
And your lips.
"You're so old and ugly, I can't look at you."
"Come on, she's beautiful."
"No, I know I'm ugly you should punish me I'm not good enough for you."
I'm just an old and ugly whore.
You want me to give you the death ray?
"Now, Marty."
"Well, then give me a quarter for a flying saucer or I'll let him have it."
"All right, dear."
Here.
MAN ON PA:
"Last call for the Santa Fe,"
"San Bernardino local, train number 54."
"Leaves at 5:30 p.m., entering through gate J."
This is the last call.
I'll take this one.
"25 cents, please."
"Here you are, I'll pay for that."
Thank you.
"Oh, don't be frightened."
(SHUDDERING) Here.
"No, no, no, that's for you."
I like little boys who have space guns.
You know why?
'Cause I have a space collection.
You have?
"Oh, sure, they're right here in this bag."
"And do you know that when I went to the moon,"
I got my first space gun.
"And since then, I've added almost 350 space guns to my collection."
"I have one space gun that shoots out little men, and those little men have space guns that shoot darts."
"And when I was in Tibet,"
"I got a space gun with camels sitting on the top of it, just about so big."
"I know it's pretty difficult to believe that, but you must believe me."
The train leaves in 15 minutes.
What if we miss him?
Not a chance.
Please.
Promise me you'll never see my daughter again.
A promise is only good if you shake on it.
Don't squeeze that hard.
Just promise you'll never see my daughter again.
I promise.
"I promise that every morning, the first thing I want to see is Marcia and the last thing I want to see at night... is Marcia."
I promise that I'll never let anyone get between us.
Let my hand go!
I promise to accept all we suffer together and truly enjoy all we live together.
Let go!
I promise to never think that I'm better than her nor that she is better than me.
"Marcia, tell this man to let my hand go."
I promise to use my own life to give Marcia a good life.
Don't squeeze it!
"And if I must,"
I promise to give my life to save hers.
Get out at once!
"Marcia, where do you think you're going?"
I won't let you date any...
low-class.
Date?
"We're getting married, mom."
I'll never let our daughter marry a worthless man.
"Hey, I'm right here!"
It's me!
"Mom, dad!"
I'm here!
Maria!
Maria!
"Get back, Maria."
We're too far up!
But I'm talking ANL Sydney.
Not Melbourne.

"If they do look into it, Bob, what are they going to find?"
Your husband?
Why?
He did not know about the work or the boys.
Boys?
There were others.
"For the last time, where is the money?"
"There is 2,000 in the almirah, take it and leave!"
Next time you come my husband will be waiting for you!
I haven't come for a handout!
I want money that is rightfully mine!
So go and ask the one who has taken it.
Ask whom?
Your husband?
He earns more in a day than you have managed in all these months!
Go and ask your friend!
The scoundrel even looked like a thief.
Don't lie.
Why do you lie?
Did you learn anything from me in all these months?
Apart from sex!
"Our work can start again, leave now..."
Think of your sisters.
I am never sinking back into your filth again!
I want my money and I want it now!
"Sarika, open the door."
Did you foresee this while you were planning your break in?
Sarika!
Open the door!
I know there is someone inside!
Open up!
Open up or I will cal in the neighbors!
Today the whole world will see your true colors... I will rub your face in dirt.
- Shut up!
Who are you?
You come in here with your fancy lipstick and your fake name.
- How do I know you don't work for those guys?
"- Eddie, just stop!"
- Shut the fuck up.
- You don't.
"But let me tell you about when I was a little girl, and Amancio killed my whole family and took me out of my pueblo."
"Or the thousands of innocents he sacrificed, or the many, many years I was his slave."
"But at the end of the day, does it really matter?"
Because the only way for you to trust me is for you to believe that I want him dead as much as you want his money.
"So, what do you say, Eddie?"
"I say you broke the code, kid."
"Oh, that fuck!"
Where's my shit?
!
- Seth took it.
- He what?
- I knew he was up to somethin'.
"- And I can tell you where,"
- but I want in on the job.
"- What is this, a potluck?"
!
"Eddie, look, okay?"
"I know you're pissed, and you have every right to be."
I messed up.
Gimme a chance to make this right.
"Larry, Larry."
Lawrence.
"Come on, man."
You gotta stop taking things so personally.
- You put my partner in traction.
"Restaurants are big down here, right?"
Huge.
Kind of resisted them at first.
"As you know, I'm not much of a foodie."
"What, now you are?"
"As a matter of fact, I am."
"When in Rome, right?"
"Well, maybe you can help us narrow down which restaurants are prime candidates."
Okay.
What do we got?
(computer blips)
How about this...
Pat O'Brien's?
Pat O's?
No way they're cartel.
They've been in the Quarter for decades.
Make a killer hurricane cocktail that'll...
You should try one.
"I'm not here for the cocktails, T."
Okay.
Let's just get Garcia and get back home.
(computer blips)
I'm not sure I want to go back home.
Sorry?
I'm just saying I'm not sure.
"Ten years ago, you couldn't get far enough away from this place fast enough, and now you like it?"
"I don't understand, Tammy."
This cartel case is your big shot.
"Isler moves up, you move up."
It's... everything you've always said you wanted.
Isn't that why we broke up?
"This isn't about me and you, Hannah."
40.
NOT EVEN CLOSE.
My God.
You really are a Chemistry teacher.
You mind?
I was terrible at Chemistry.
I'm more of a Humanities guy.
How did you find me?
We should talk about that.
"It should be much, much harder for people to track you down."
"My PI charged me for three hours, so I seriously doubt it took him more than one."
"So this is what, blackmail?"
"Walter, I'm your lawyer."
Anything you say to me is totally privileged.
I'm not in the shake-down racket.
I'm a lawyer.
"Even drug dealers need lawyers, right?"
Especially drug dealers.
"So what, you're just doing this out of the kindness of your heart?"
Come on.
Have you seen my hourly rate?
"By the way, where do you keep the money?"
Is it in your mattress?
"Is it in a jelly jar, buried in the side yard?"
"This kid Mayhew may be the first of your guys to get picked up, but he won't be the last."
"And if I can find you, how far behind can the cops be?"
I don't understand.
What exactly are you offering to do for me?
What did Tom Hagen do for Vito Corleone?
I'm no Vito Corleone.
No shit!
Right now you're Fredo.
Marion's dead.
"Yes, I know."
And me!
And me!
I'm sorry.
"Life goes on, Indy."
There is the proof.
Uh-oh.
I have much to tell you.
"First we will take them home, and then I will take you to the old man."
I can't figure out how Belloq did it.
Where'd he get a copy of the headpiece?
"There are no pictures, no duplicates of it anywhere."
I tell you only what I saw with my own eyes:
"A headpiece like that one, except round the edges, which were rougher."
"In the center, the Frenchman had embedded a crystal, and... and surrounding the crystal, on one side, there were raised markings, just like that one."
They made their calculations in the map room?
This morning.
"Belloq and the boss German, Dietrich."
"When they came out of the map room, they gave us a new spot in which to dig, out away from the camp."
"The Well of the Souls, huh?"
"Come, come, look."
Look here...
look.
Sit down.
"Come, sit down."
What is it?
This is a warning not to disturb the Ark of the Covenant.
"What about the height of the staff, though?"
Did Belloq get it off of here?
Yes.
It is here.
I have to go.
"Yes, come fast, OK."
OK Madam.
"Two minutes more, Sir, He's not our Laxminarayan."
"I told you he's my Laxminarayan, Yes it's your piece and it's yours too."
"""When there is life, there is living"""
Sir i want to check out.
I want to check out please make my bill.
Why Sir you were suppose to leave tomorrow?
"Sir, yeah but i want to go now."
Please make my bill.
"Please make my bill, i want to check out."
Please make it quick.
"My luck is not good, will you change it?"
"What kind of man you are, asking question on questions cheak out please!"
"""When there is life, there is living"""
why you are laughing?
Yeah ma'am?
"Ma'am, Inspector..."
recognize me?
How can i forget you?
You are look changed.
Did you had accident?
"Yeah just like accident, kindly take me with you."
"Oh my duty alarm... when i see you i feel like i should hit the alarm because i am on duty, so i cant even hit the alarm."
Madam?
Did you find him?
I couldn't find Laxmi Narayan.
"You shut up... let's check over there, ok tata, bye, see you."
Did you had Viagra?
And now you cant control it?
"Don't do this, don't play with my feelings."
Discipline and complaints.
Open up.
Now!
"What are you doing to my guests, Jack?"
No one's drinking.
They've all brought their cars.
You should have warned them in advance that I was a copper.
But then of course we might have been alone.
"Would you get me some more orange juice, it's in the fridge."
Yes ma'am.
Thank you.
"Oh, dear, this is no way to do it."
I should have known better.
What?
"Well, I wanted to see you on my own."
"To talk, not about anything in particular, but without, I don't know, without feeling there were things about myself"
I couldn't say.
"But I lost my nerve and invited, it was like looking up the recipe for disaster and doubling the quantities."
"Well then, next time cut down on the invitations."
I wanted you to carve.
"Yes, of course, right."
What's that?
Oh excuse me.
"That's you getting me excited, that is."
My bleeper.
"Oh, I don't believe this."
"All right, what's going on."
I just got an urgent call.
Discipline and Complaints walked in here half an hour ago.
I tried to get hold of Mr. Mullett.
That's what it's about.
It's the soap.
What's the difference.
"So, what's this I hear about you and Jordan?"
- l can't believe this.
- You know they had sex.
- Rayanne.
- That's what I heard.
You heard it too?
"God, just shoot me."
- We could probably arrange that.
- You mean you didn't have sex?
"Angela come on, come."
You've got to start thinking of this as a positive thing.
This can help you get to the next level with Jordan.
Did he at least think you were a good kisser?
- l don't know.
- Did you like the way he kissed?
They weren't the kind of kisses you can actually evaluate.
I ntroductory kisses.
You should have had sex with him.
Where were you when the gun went off?
"Mom, it wasn't anywhere near us."
We barely heard it.
We have to worry about our kids being shot in school.
How did it come to this.
This is horrible.
This is a disgrace to all of us--
- That's too much.
- l'm sorry honey.
I'm going to say it in this meeting.
I am. I mean it.
We have to draw the line somewhere.
We just can't keep accepting the total deterioration--
Do you have conscience or not?
You don't answer your mobile.
Nobody knows where you are.
I'm nervous!
Have you forgotten that we're going to Paris?
I can't go to Paris now.
Take some rest there without me for a few days.
No.
- I have an important meeting.
- No!
You promised to spend two days with me.
Why are you sitting here?
"Who are you meeting with, if it's not a secret?"
It's not a secret.
I'm meeting with Garik.
- With Garik...
- Yes.
This meeting is more important to me than to him.
"So Garik can't wait, can he?"
Why do you react in such a way?
Lets go.
- What?
"- Let's go, I say!"
I'll give you a lift.
His place is on my way.
"Close the bag, let's go."
I got used to your lies.
I got used to the fact that you have affairs with other women.
But I can't get used to your cynicism and your perverse cruelty.
What women?
What cynicism?
"You've been telling me about meetings with your best friend, your former classmate Garik for a long time."
Athos saw me.
There's no going back now.
"My dear fellow, that would be treason and foolhardy."
Louis is already dying.
"I hope you are not having doubts, Feron?"
You are asking me to kill my own brother!
"If you don't, then he will discover your betrayal and hang you."
"And if he doesn't, I will hang you!"
Thank you.
You will kill Aramis and the King.
Very well.
(LAUGHS)
"Now we found a nice spot in the shade, we can wait."
Properly.
"Come on, come on."
"That's it, good... (WHISPERS) Please be good, please be good, please be good."
(SNIFFS)
"Oh, this could turn out to be a good day after all."
I imagine the General's aide will be a little while longer yet.
(LAUGHS)
"How many battles did we fight, eh?"
(CHUCKLES)
- Too many.
- Hmm.
Yeah.
"We've served our country, often and well."
"So if we are rewarded with the odd mission like this,"
I won't complain.
"In that case, I'd like to propose a toast."
"To easy missions, well earned."
To easy missions well earned.
Ooh.
MAN:
Clear it off the south perimeter!
MAN:
Here comes your dad.
The rooms here also--
What's the situation?
He's gonna kill the girl unless we call CNN and tell the world we're not alone.
You two were going to pick her up.
This was supposed to be easy.
It got a little complicated.
I'm handling it.
How?
.
"I say what I have to, promise him anything he wants."
Just make sure the girl doesn't get hurt.
No one's going to get killed here today.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You got a nice move to the post.
"That kid yesterday thought he could get one past you, but you were right there."
What I do is I fool myself.
I make myself believe I'm really going to cover.
"Because I believe it, he believes it."
How do you get yourself over to the post?
I don't know.
"I'm afraid if I ever stop to think about it, it won't work anymore."
Do you know why you're here?
Do you know what this is about?
"I'm not sure yet, but I think we're gonna find out soon."
"This is the year for the ""big ideas,"" right?"
( groans )
Hey...hey.
We're going to need ten Jericho men to help us build them.
It wasn't safe for us there anymore.
You can't just ride into New Bern and start breaking china.
It's a full inventory of Jericho.
They sliced it up like they own it.
They're making mortar rounds.
They're getting ready for war.
Hold it!
We wanted to break the machine.
Stop the factory.
Where's Heather?
"She's dead,Jake."
Jake!
Everybody go!
Jericho is about to be invaded.
We'll do this day and night for as long as it takes.
Most of you have no idea what's coming.
This isn't a fight about land.
This is a fight for our very existence.
"Jerry, I know this has great artistic merit, but I'm taking these shoes off in ten minutes."
"So, if you don't want to have to hide my toes..."
"Oh, Gail, make yourself comfortable."
We can't really do this without the best man anyway.
Where is Jake?
I don't see him.
Yeah.
"Grandpa seems to be missing, too."
Take a wild guess where they are.
Right.
"Oh, Beth."
"It's so nice to see you, dear."
Charlie.
- Okay.
- Homesick?
I don't know.
How's Asger?
- Okay.
- Say hi.
I will...
See you.
"Hey, don't forget your little present."
"So I pocket the lump, catch the night train and go back to Jutland."
End of story.
But it doesn't work anymore.
It's like a prison I can't get out of.
I'm not like this.
I'm not.
"I only do it, because Asger hasn't got anybody else to do it."
And because I'm the one who knows people in Christiania.
A pusher frau.
"She waits on drug users, who come around to buy drugs."
"I get them coffee, while they tell me I look good   because they want to suck up to the pusher, who couldn't care less."
He's too stoned to notice anything.
That's Asger.
He's pretty spaced out and indifferent.
To me as well.
But it wasn't like that in the beginning.
He used to be a bouncer.
"Big and strong, with a sexy tattoo on his ass."
With Asger it was so different!
He ate pussy like nobody else.
"He was so good at it, and I felt I was in love for the first time ever."
Asger is not a bouncer anymore.
He's a full-time pusher.
No stoppin' till dark.
Tin whistle plays
"You're in my light, damn you, Hagman!"
"I beg your pardon, sir."
But it's Captain Murray.
"He's poorly, sir."
Harris.
"Figure me this, Harris."
Where is the bugger planning on taking us?
Sorry to be so much trouble.
"You did well today, Sharpe."
"I did my duty, sir."
We're lost.
And we've lost Hogan's trail.
Try to find your way to Casa Antigua.
"I'll find it, sir."
"Don't be too hard on the men, Sharpe."
How can say this without offence?
You see the lads don't like an officer who's come from the ranks
They want an officer to be privileged to be set apart from them... touched by grace
They think of you as one of them Sharpe one of the damned
know now hard it must be
Sorry.
Of course I don't...
I don't know.
I'm just trying to think of some practical advice after I've gone.
"Oh, yes."
Get Patrick Harper on your side.
"Is that an order, sir?"
I want you to have my sword.
Maybe if the men see you carry it...
They'll think I'm a proper officer?
# Just put a melody to the words #
# That you're sayin' and soon you'll be-- #
"Dad, I wanna join the basketball team."
What did you say?
This kid at school today told me I should do what I wanna do.
That's what I really wanna do.
Basketball?
!
No son of mine is going to be a sweaty little jock!
"But, Dad, it's what I really want."
There's no singing and dancing in basketball!
"I know, that's kind of why I like it."
Don't you even think about it!
"If I had a jock for a son,"
I'd be the laughing stock of the men's choir club!
"It's my life, Dad!"
Don't make me slap you.
I will slap your face so super hard!
I am the man of this house!
You disrespect me and you're gonna get slapped!
Maybe you should let him try it.
"What did you say, woman?"
!
You aren't being fair.
That's it!
I'm gonna slap you!
"No, please!"
# I slap you I slap you #
"# I slap, slap, slap you #"
# I'm slappin' you slapping' you silly 'cause you disrespected me #
"You guys, I need to copy your math homework before class."
"You're not copying my homework, you lazy turd."
"He'll never get a job, not even in the fields."
He can't even calculate how much a man would plough during an 8 hour shift.
"If in one hour, 8 men can do..."
He'd only be good at playing football!
- Addie!
- You stay here!
"Hey, you!"
Open it!
Open it or there'll be trouble!
"Don't hurt him, it's his birthday!"
"Yeah, and I have a short temper!"
"Adam, come out!"
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
"Don't do this, my dear son!"
"Open it now, you hear me?"
Addie!
"It's only me, your father isn't here."
You can open it.
Please!
What is it?
You've locked yourself in again?
"The folks from the Council were here yesterday as well, complaining that you must be brewing alcohol here secretly!"
You know what?
They can all go to hell!
What am I supposed to do with the apples?
Let them rot?
They're travelling with their houses!
"Gee, animal sculptures."
They must be art collectors.
"I just changed the number plate, and the colour as well."
"And you just play here, when we're clearly late already!"
We'll never make it to Kamenice like this!
Into the jungle!
- Hurry up!
Run away!
- I'm staying with you.
Idiot!
Do you want to die?
"Just drop everything and hide, for God's sake!"
We must help them.
We can't stand by and watch.
They're going to kill everyone.
"- We must do something, for Christ's sake!"
- We must go.
I can't jeopardise our plan.
"I know you don't understand, but more people would die than those whom we can't help right now."
I can't just stand by and watch.
I'm going back to the village.
"Right, let's continue."
Mum!
Mum!
- Dad...
- Be quiet!
Take him away from here.
"Come on, let's get back."
"Capitán, we've searched the entire village."
There's not a single guerrillero among the dead.
They've managed to escape.
"Once they're in the jungle, we'll never catch them."
Those bastards are creeping away like millipedes.
"Carry on, but don't take any prisoners."
"My patience is nearly exhausted, Silveira."
These leaflets are flooding the country.
It is your job to prevent that.
"Yes, it is."
"Inside this skull is another universe... the biggest, scariest haunted house of them all."
"Elmer, will you hurry up and tell Dr. Hook how profound he is... so we can get inside this poor guy's noggin and reduce the cranial pressure?"
"Anyway, after I've paused to reflect on the gravity of what it is I am about to do... and only after I've done that, do I proceed with my mission."
"Yes, Doctor."
"Steady as you go, Otto."
"Patient to Nine, Neuro."
Standing by.
"You'll be fine, Mrs. D."
"Yeah, I will."
You tell Bobby not to worry.
Bye-bye.
These things are so slow.
Mommy.
Someone was crying in the Children's Ward?
"We call it Paediatrics these days, Mrs. Druse."
"Well, whatever you call it, it sounded like it was right on top of the elevator."
A little girl.
I see.
It's very hard to get a place in here.
A gusher!
Mop.
"Irrigation people, come on."
Don't let this man drown.
"Come on, you're up, Elmer."
"Jump in here, please."
- That's not my job.
- Your union steward is not on duty today.
"If you wouldn't mind jumping in, right about now."
"Come on, son."
Right there.
Very nice.
-I got it!
"-Hey, ten days!"
"Wait, I can be out of here tomorrow morning, in Chicago, and outside of her dressing..."
"Hey, come on, fellas, I'm a little, you know..."
"-Sarge, I'm tapped out."
"-Me, too."
What a time.
"Men, freeze."
"Freeze, you heroes."
"Men, I may have seemed a little harsh with you."
It's only because I was mad at myself for forgetting to tell you the new thing I thought up for you.
It's only a buck a throw-- my new snack-in-the-sack raffle.
Snack-in-the-sack raffle?
What's that?
Just what it says.
The guy who wins gets his breakfast served in bed for ten days.
"How about it, boys?"
"-But Sarge, we're broke."
"-Busted, not a dime."
It's a miracle how this platoon is always broke at the same...
"Zimmerman, on the double, right here."
"Yeah, but Sarge, you told me..."
Right here.
"Now, Herman, you're not going to take me serious all the time, are you?"
I want this.
I want these deadheads to look at a real live wire.
This boy's not broke all the time.
Why?
"'Cause he's on the hustle, he thinks up things, washes officers' cars at a buck a throw."
He's all right.
(chuckles)
"How much did you make, Herman?"
What's this noise are you outside?
What are you doing out so late?
- We have run away from there...
We are on our way to Delhi.
Run away!
What do you mean you have run away!
Have you gone mad!
What the hell is going on there?
I'll explain everything once I reach.
I told you to stay on for a few days!
Can't you understand that much?
Are you little children!
"Brother, please don't get angry...the warden."
What did she do?
"Sonu, tell me what happened?"
She got drunk and came in Chhoti's room...
Was trying to slip into her bed.
I'll explain everything tomorrow.
You both take care of yourselves...
Do you have money?
Yes.
"Call me as soon as your reach, I will come and get you."
"Here, gulp it down."
Johnny bhai.
Could you lend me some money?
I will return it soon.
Money?
If I had any money saved do you think I would have been stuck in this city.
I would have gone away to Mauritius long back!
I live off the dead!
I bury one corpse to get one meal!
I am surviving because people die in this city everyday.
- Don't worry.
- I just have to solve this quickly.
- How are you going to do that?
He's ten times sneakier than you.
What is going on between you two?
He's trying to frame me for something that he did.
What?
Did he... do anything to harm a person?
Is that what this blood is from?
Go home.
We never should have taken his money.
"It's all because of me, isn't it?"
I kept nagging about our loans and the lesson fees...
- All I talked about was money...
- Don't say that...
What family doesn't struggle with money?
If I didn't scare you with my words...
You would have cut that Park Seon Woo out of your life earlier.
But I didn't know anything.
I just got excited when I saw money.
This is all because of me...
We're a family.
Why do we have to throw blame around?
Don't worry.
Just go home.
Justice will prevail.
Remember that.
"You can come home by tomorrow morning, right?"
It's Soo Bin's birthday...
We should blow out the candles together.
Then of course I will.
"Hey, let me go!"
Then it became the TV show for HBO and that took you to Hollywood.
Yeah.
How did that come about?
"We did the Conchords on HBO, so even that was very popular."
"It was on a cable channel, so there were so many millions of people that never saw it, but of course, when it came out on DVD, a lot of people saw it after that."
On the one DVD?
There's two DVDs now.
You pass the DVDs around?
We pass them round.
Yeah.
So all the cast and crew saw it.
"And then word got out, you see."
It was big in the comedy circles.
You're familiar with those circles.
"Yes, I am."
"We're going to talk more in a little minute, but just sit back and relax now and please welcome the very, very funny Charlie Baker!"
APPLAUSE
Hello!
That's very nice of you.
That's enough.
I might be rubbish!
"Hello, I'm Charlie Baker."
I'm waiting for Jack Black to die.
LAUGHTER
I've only ever met a couple of very famous people.
"Jay-Z, Jay-Z, the world's biggest rapper, Jay-Z."
"I don't know about you, but if I see someone famous, I have a little voic in the back of my head that goes, ""There's Jay-Z there."
"""There's Jay-Z, the world's biggest rapper."
There he is.
"""Go and speak to Jay-Z."
Go on.
"""Say something to him."
Out of anything.
I mean if everybody's...
already assuming it anyway.
"Maybe, we should just..."
It's amazing the things you notice.
Like the corner of his collar that was coming undone.
LIke he was from a poor family and couldn't afford new shirts.
That's all I could see.
The whole world was that unraveled piece of fabric.
I think I have to go.
"- Look, I'm sorry if l--"
"- No, it's okay."
- No pressure or anything.
- l have to go.
You could just think about it.
It's such a lie that you should do what's In your heart.
"If we all did what was In our hearts, the world would grind to a halt."
And they know that he knows and I can't believe he didn't tell them.
He got a perfect score on his PSAT.
Do you believe that?
Math will be ruined.
What does this have to do with Angela?
That's when they had sex.
Her and Jordan?
- At Brian's house.
- Oh my God.
Can you believe it?
Right in the front yard.
Brian watched the entire thing through his kitchen window.
I thought you and Angela were really tight.
She was like my best friend.
This whole things been really hard for me to accept.
"More, more!"
"Come, how do you like the fucking!"
Now you will feel my prick from behind.
"Yes, do so my love."
Yes lend me a hand.
Please give me a hand.
-Does your man never do that to you?
-Never.
You are so right to be annoyed.
"-He is a peasant, yes, a bumpkin."
"Enter me, my love, from behind."
Pull my arse apart and hammer it.
Here we come.
"Yes, it fits well inside."
"Dirty slut, one hand masturbates in the front... and the other from behind."
"Say, that nobody ever made you enjoy yourself, ..."
-like that.
Made you come like me!
-Yes.
"Yes, nobody ever before you made me enjoy it so."
I am coming!
Do you hear me my love?
What is going on?
What do I hear?
Ahh!
"Look, Mrs. Rosella sees my films as committed by her husband."
Very well.
"There is a secure future for... telephone operators of the ""hot line""."
"-The more confessors there are,... the more 'talking sluts' there seem to be."
"And how do you react, when you see my films?"
"Obviously, it obliges me to please my boyfriend."
This was written by a man.
What did you do?
What did you do?
Answer me!
Why are we here?
No one should live like this.
Drugged in a fucking tank!
It's for your own good.
it's not!
You're waiting for me to die.
I don't wanna fight but there's things we need to discuss.
What things?
would it be considered nagging if I was to repeat my previous observation that the dose is too low to suppress the seizures?
It's what the guy gave me.
Wasn't in a position to make demands.
I almost died this morning.
That seizure was...
It was barely a minute.
It felt a lot longer than a minute.
I couldn't breathe.
You're less affected.
You know he needs a higher dose.
And I know you got more money squirreled away.
That money's to get us out of here.
not us.
You and him.
You're saving to buy a Sunseeker.
"Sun"" is the keyword."
I hardly see myself cowering below decks like Nosferatu.
Do you?
and making him spotted dick.
Found this in your pocket.
Adamantium.
This was the night when friendship was truly solidified.
"Because at the beginning of this scene, I'd thrown up into a plastic bag but still had to hold the gum in my mouth, and then gave the gum to you."
- So you had...
- And I put it in my mouth.
You had my ABC gum that had been sitting in my mouth with fake throw up.
"With fake barf and then I put it back in your mouth because we realized, that once it lost its flavor it was better that way."
- Of course.
- This is so sweet.
This is the...
People go... when they see this.
- No joke.
- I'll do it.
"We had Chinese food, like, three weeks ago..."
"Oh, Chinese."
"- Oh, I love Chinese."
- There it is.
- There it is.
- These kids are so adorable.
God.
"Let's talk about something, like..."
"What's on your little paper, Pete?"
- A reference paper for stories.
- Yeah.
"Yeah, let's whip it out."
- What's it say?
- Does anyone wanna talk about...
Talk about the gum.
When you guys shared the gum.
"- We just did that, Mike."
- Okay.
About Mike and Kat living in New York for the first time?
This was the first time that me and Kat lived in New York.
I'd sold something.
I thought he could use the cash and I could sketch him.
What had you been told?
That he was beautiful.
I wanted to see for myself.
And you found him dying?
But he was exquisite.
There's a photo in the Tate Modern.
Like this.
How we look from 900m up.
"All dots, an irrelevance."
"Don't go metaphysical, mate."
Juries hate that.
The Greeks were terrified of beauty too.
"They saw it as a torment, excruciating, unreachable."
I want to capture the precise moment when things are exquisite.
"Listen, I don't normally make a habit of asking this but this time it matters."
Did you murder him?
"No, I did not."
Some dots stand out.
Are you OK?
"So why do you want to run, Dave?"
I'd like to make a difference.
"Oh, yeah?"
Example?
"Well, I think we could try to make New South Wales the hardest State in the country to buy a gun."
"Whoa, there."
Tread carefully.
We've still got a few very marginal country seats.
We don't want to upset the gun lobby.
"(Laughs) For fuck's sake, Wal."
What's so funny?
"Number nine, Nathan Road."
"You know, you should not follow the trend to cut your hair like this!"
Different people should have different hair styles.
"See, your hair doesn't match your face."
And your face doesn't match your body.
Your body doesn't match your hair.
Completely ugly!
What the hell do you want?
"Master, I know it's my fault, please don't blame me."
I regret to cut my hair.
Sit down first.
Tell me the whole story.
Alright.
"Oh that day, I wandered off alone on the Nathan Road."
"When I reached number 9, Nathan Road, a fat woman waved to me."
"She said, ""Come to have your hair cut, it costs 5 cents only!"""
That's why I followed her.
"I always told you, cheap things are no good!"
You know your mistake now?
"Let's go back to the case, alright?"
"On that day, I went to the HK Club for the lion dance as usual."
"After the performance, I went back to the back stage."
"Suddenly someone covered my head with a rice bag, he pushed me on the wall, when I struggled with him..."
"Suddenly, someone took off my pants..."
Did he...
Yes!
What did you feel?
Painful?
No.
Funny?
No!
"My ass was seen, and I felt a bit cool."
"- Let me help you, Clark."
"- No, it's dangerous."
I'm not afraid.
Do I love you?
You know you're everything to me.
And you to me.
You are.
Oh.
What?
Do you want me to use my mouth?
- No.
- What?
What's wrong?
I've -
- I'm...
I'm just too upset.
And I've had too much to drink.
I have to go.
"Well, Clark, you don't have to leave."
"Yes, I do."
"If you do engage in a lot of foreplay so that you are going to be very moist inside the vagina and if you are putting your behind on a pillow so that penetration is going to be a little bit easier,"
"the more relaxed you are, the less it's going to be a problem."
"What you also can do is actually help him insert the penis into the vagina, because this way, you have some control over how fast you have to go..."
Mind if I turn it off?
No.
Go ahead.
I'll tell you what -- if the two of you love each other --
You going somewhere?
"Uh, my mom's."
Oh.
Did you mention that?
I-I don't remember.
You bastard!
"You don't even have tears in your eyes, can you see it?"
It's dry!
You are caught red-handed!
Why do you pretend crying?
To hell with you!
"Hey, you'd better behave!"
"Wait, let me tell you a story."
"Once upon a time, there was a noble named Ho."
He had a son named Ho Chung.
"Sir Ho was old, his son would be his heir of course."
"But, suddenly, his nullius filius Ho Foon appeared."
Someone worried his status would be affected.
So he sent his fellow Chun... to kill that nullius filius.
"But, Chun failed."
Someone just took this opportunity to kill Chun.
And made that poor kid be the scapegoat.
That guy is really hard-hearted and cold-blooded!
What do you think about my assumption?
"Prosecutor, why do you laugh?"
Because this is such a nonsense and stupid story.
"Nonsense and stupid, huh?"
But you are all sweat!
It's really weird.
"Prosecutor, where were you when the homicide happened?"
At home.
What were you doing?
Reading.
What book did you read?
A tale of two cities.
Where did you stop?
Well... the soldiers...
"- Speak for yourself, okay?"
Can you please just open it?
- For me?
- What is it?
"It's a pony, baby."
"I don't-- Come on, for me, please just..."
These are White House passes.
Yeah.
That might mean we're going to the White House.
And that your dad here has a job interview with the Secret Service.
"This is really cool, John."
"- You're just gonna stick with ""John""?"
- Yeah.
"Now The Roger Skinner Show, today live from the White House."
"Hi, folks."
President Sawyer is one of those academics who never served a day in his life and now he wants to tell the military how to run things?
He's going to make peace with Iran because he has friends there now?
Come on.
"Sir, I have the first lady for you."
Remind me again why we let these guys broadcast from our lawn.
- Freedom of the press.
- You know what?
I knew it was something.
"Hey, babe."
How are the French taking it?
The treaty's gonna be a tough sell here.
- How's it going there?
- Raphelson is the key.
"We lose him, then we lose that Southern voting bloc."
"If this goes down, you're looking at a one-term president."
I know two people who wouldn't have a problem with that.
Do you still have that watch I gave you?
"You know, if there are other people in this town... who are feeling as... confused as I am right now..."
I'd sure like to hear it.
"The past few months, people have been coming up to me... and reporting that they've been seeing strange things."
I don't mean the town speed freak.
"I mean good, honest, church going people."
I've known these folks my entire life... and they seem down right embarrassed to be bringing it up.
Bringing what up?
It's hard to explain.
Weird lights.
"Strange phone calls, you."
I heard a crack...
A very strange sensation.
Reds eyes.
"""As a moth""."
Lights and calls phone strange.
You.
Seeing a UFO is one thing.
What do you do when someone tells you they saw this in their backyard?
What is it?
My wife died two years ago.
She saw something.
Drew pictures.
Who showed you this?
It was right here.
There was only a foot or so
Between its head and that branch.
That makes it about... eight feet tall.
Yeah.
I was getting ready for bed and just.
Happened to glance out the window.
At first all I could see... were these two red eyes.
I kept looking at it.
"I mean, we're writing a children's book, not how Joy mouse got her groove back."
"And then I said, ""middleton?"
"I thought you said wimbledon."""
Reminds me of the time I was invited to the duchess of... oh.
What?
Do I have something on my tooth?
"No, quite the opposite, actually."
Seems you have a tooth on your something.
Oh.
"Excuse me, won't you?"
Goodness.
"That woman's a bit of a disaster, isn't she?"
Perhaps you and I could go somewhere a little more private.
"I'd love to, but that disaster is my sister, and she needs my help."
Would you excuse me?
"- Honey, are you all right?"
- Are you hurt?
"I'm fine, just hideously embarrassed."
- Let me help.
"- Jill, what about the Earl?"
You took a tumble.
It's my turn to pick you up and dust you off.
"On your feet, cabbage."
She looks like a pirate.
All that's missing is a parrot on her shoulder.
All that's missing is my fist in your throat.
"Jill, that's so sweet."
"Let's save the smiles till we get home, shall we?"
Thank you.
There's the end of our story:
The sisters choose each other.
"Oh, I love the way we write."
Did you sleep well?
I made some breakfast.
I'd have made some for you as well but... that was the last of the bacon.
Are they always this noisy upstairs?
I like it.
People enjoying themselves.
Helps me get to sleep.
"They're Colombians, I think."
"So, what happens now, Calum?"
About what?
I'm sorry.
I forget you need a bit of extra help sometimes.
Yesterday?
I was dragged here from prison.
Do you remember that?
You were nearly garroted.
"Oh, that!"
They wouldn't have gone through with it really.
"Just their idea of a little kinky game, was it?"
Yeah.
"I'm a bit worried he likes me too much, actually."
"And so when are they gonna turn up again, Calum?"
"Oh, don't worry."
Lenny'll be back soon.
"And that's what he does, by the way."
Turns up.
"Doesn't always knock, either."
"So, make sure you're not doing any washing up naked."
"You'll be wanting to see your sister after this, I expect."
"You've not even met your niece yet, have you?"
Is that allowed?
Course it is.
And we've learned over the years to separate the real Lucy from who Lucy is when she's ill.
"- Yeah, because that's so easy."
"- No, I totally get it."
You what?
"Well, I understand what your mom's saying."
"I mean, people can't be blamed for something if they're sick, right?"
Hm?
- Thank you.
- So now you're on her side too.
"No, no, no, I'm not on anyone's side."
"- Uh, uh..."
- Except for your side.
I'm on your side.
Don't let the sniping fool you.
There's affection there.
I'm sorry.
Are you new here?
"Because my loving sister, well, she tried to kill me."
"That was just the illness, right?"
She didn't want you dead.
Dead enough.
How dead do you have to be around here till someone takes your freaking side?
Let me guess.
This wasn't a typical dinner at your house.
Heh.
You can't even slam a freaking door in this house!
"Look, I was just trying to understand your sister."
Everyone is always trying to understand my sister.
"Trust me, no one has come up with anything yet."
I thought you were gonna be the person who'd try to understand me.
"- Everybody can hear those voices, right?"
"- Yes, honey."
"Hey, Christine."
I think we're done.
"I-I have to go, Mom."
"No, they're calling us back to the sabbatical room."
"Yeah, of course it has a room."
"Uh, do you even know what a sabbatical is?"
"Oh, it is?"
"Okay, I-I love you."
I do show it.
I have to go.
Bad news.
Mom and Dad can't make Grandparents' Day.
Why not?
"Dad's run out of miles on his car lease, Mom did some calculations and, at 15 cents a mile, it just wasn't worth it."
Does this mean I can't go to Grandparents' Day?
"No, of course not, sweetie."
"You know what, Uncle Matthew will go as your special friend."
I don't want to go with a special friend.
The only one in my grade who has a special friend is that weird kid with the gray hair.
"To be honest, I'm also getting a little uncomfortable introducing myself as a nine-year-old boy's ""special friend."""
"Daddy, maybe you could go as Ritchie's grandfather."
You guys had so much fun when we went miniature golfing the other day.
"Well, I'd be happy to, if Ritchie wants me to."
"Yeah, that'd be great!"
What?
!
"No, no."
"I'm sorry, that's not appropriate."
Appropriate?
You once dated your cousin.
Second cousin.
And he asked me out.
"I mean, isn't it?"
I can hardly stand it when he's away for a night.
"Oh, stella."
"When he's away for a week, I nearly go wild."
-Gracious.
-When he comes back I cry in his lap like a baby.
I guess that's what's meant by being in love.
stella.
I haven't asked you the things you probably thought I was going to ask so I'II expect you to be understanding about what I have to tell you.
"What, BIanche?"
You're going to reproach me.
"I know you're bound to reproach me, but before you do take into consideration you left."
I stayed and struggled.
You came to New orleans and looked out for yourself.
I stayed at belle Reve and tried to hold it together.
"Oh, I'm not meaning this in any reproachfuI way."
-But the burden descended on my shoulders.
-Best I couId do was make my own living.
"But you were the one that abandoned belle Reve, not I."
"I fought for it, bled for it, almost died for it."
Stop this outburst.
tell me what happened.
-I knew you'd take this attitude about it.
-About what?
please!
The loss.
The loss.
belle Reve?
"Lost, is it?"
"Yes, stella."
But how did it go?
What happened?
"Right now, my dad and brother Don't believe."
In a damned thing That I'm telling them.
"I mean, sure it would be easier To go somewhere else,"
"But there's a million Dollars at the bluffs,"
"And I'm gonna go get it,"
And there's no on That's gonna stop me.
The only way I can lose Right now.
Is if I get eaten By a grizzly bear.
That's about it.
Coming up...
"You want to grab one Of those samples, sam?"
Hell yeah.
It's almost dark.
We have no place to stay.
We're not gonna freeze to death!
I can figure it out.
Gold mining in the bering sea.
Is a tough way to make a living.
"You need to take chances And take risks,"
And do things that Normal people wouldn't do.
My dad was the one that Originally started.
The icemining idea.
We've been doing it For 15 years.
"Dad built a little fish house,"
"And then put a sixinch Dredge in there, and..."
That was the first time I ever went diving.
"About 10 minutes later, I come Up, and my lips were blue,"
"And I was hypothermic, and..."
"But that's what got me Into diving,"
And looking for gold In the ocean.
10 miles east of nome...
At hastings creek.
We'll see if she calls back.
I don't want to hear it.
Shame on you!
"- Is this what you ordered, sir?"
- Yes.
Thank you.
I'm not staying with you.
I'm finishing my apple and going home.
"Mom wanted to protect us, that's why she hid it."
"She was a wise woman, she realized our lives would be a nightmare if her secret came out."
"- What, that he's an Arab?"
- Exactly.
"You can play innocent and call me a racist and pretend you're from Mars, not from Jerusalem."
"And that you don't care it he's an Arab,"
- but it means something to me.
"- Me, too."
But I want to see who he is.
You don't have to be here.
You only get in the way.
"- Shai, you're going too far."
- You're right.
I found what I'm looking for.
I don't need this.
- Are you implying something?
"- No, I'm saying it."
How long can you blame Dad for your screwed-up life?
And we're following you like idiots.
"Leave me alone, Shai- Go find your answers somewhere else-."
"Right, maybe I'll find God and eat apples."
Maybe you should.
- Is that your idea or did Haziya write it for you?
- Watch your mouth.
What is going on?
Leave me.
Leave me...
leave me!
What is going on?
What happen?
"I think his death will happen with my hand, stand straight, or i will beat you some rascal is getting nail."
Not wall the door.
"Now i had enough of beating him, now call the police."
"Don't do this Sir, my hotel is very good."
"You are right, not necessary, the work has done."
"Papa will not do this again, Papa say sorry to Mummy."
Just finish it sir.
They have beaten me a lot.
The worst way.
Like Dog.
"You told me to beat Papa, not like this!"
Please let me go.
"Papa he also nailed you., he nailed him like pig, he is very dangerous man."
Size of your underwear...
"Laxmi Narayan is going away with bag, where are you going?"
"You take your bag too, lets press the remote from here."
"Not from here, take this left right from here."
Lets move.
Press the button boss.
Not now.
Come-on sit in the car.
"Let me go please, no!"
"Press the button, which one Papa?"
The left one.
And now you cant ask who's left because its everyone's left.
"There is only one... make target on Laxmi Yadev, and Khujli make target on Laxmi."
He's a consultant.
I thought the movie was about 18th-century Vienna.
He can't have a hobby?
!
"Excuse me, I have to pee."
"Or is that implausible, as well?"
!
"It's nice to have another couple to hang with, isn't it?"
"All right, guys, you have to go back."
I can't afford you.
"No, don't send us away; we love you."
"I love you, too, but you cost more than my rent."
"But, Penny, you look so good in us."
"Damn it, the shoes are right."
"Good golly, Penny, your whimsy is boundless."
"What do you got for me, wildebeest?"
I think they're on to me.
The story's starting to fall apart.
Calm down.
Everything's going to be okay.
We may have to kill her.
"Bernadette, I'm putting you on speakerphone."
Where are you now?
In the bathroom.
"Oh, look at this, another one of our classic bathroom gabfests."
What's the problem?
They're just asking me all sorts of questions I can't answer.
Just change the subject.
I suppose I could get them back to talking about Leonard going to India to meet Priya's parents.
What?
!
They said something about going there this summer.
"yeah, i guess you're right."
i wonder why harley would have lied about skipping school.
"- well, maybe... he's hiding something."
- huh.
harley has a shirt with his name on it?
!
he has a job!
that little bastard.
- literally.
- hey.
what does he need money for?
"i mean, if he has a job, then i should be getting..."
- you should ge getting what?
"- well, i should just know about it because he's my son, and i should know about everything that he's doing."
"- mm-hmm. so if you knew about this job... you wouldn't buy all that needless crap on his credit account, ask him to bring home pop, cheez whiz, and lotto tickets?"
that wouldn't happen?
"- [sighs, taps foot]"
"- ah, champ."
they got you stacking toilet paper.
"- merry christmas, uncle bob."
and i'm... [sighs] i'm sorry about tim's black eye.
"- oh, he'll be fine."
"i'm not too merry, though."
marge left me.
- how come?
"- oh, it's nothing."
she'll be back... i hope.
"anyway, i'm here for you."
is this what you wanted?
"- yeah. thanks for doing this, uncle bob."
"i mean, they wouldn't send the bill out to a kid."
"- hey, champ, you don't have to do this."
Don't be emotional.
Please leave!
I must see the chief.
"Brothers, the way he fights looks similar to us!"
Stop!
He must have a particular reason.
Brother!
We'll let our chief decide!
Thanks very much!
"Chief, we couldn't stop him from entering here."
Please accept me!
Why do you want to be my student?
My master Liu Chung belonged to Shaolin.
He was a student of Wu-mei.
I wish to learn more about kung-fu.
"Although you're a Shaolin student, you're too eager to kill, so we can't accept you."
He was anxious to enter the temple and so fought with our fellow monks.
That's why he gives off a killer's aura.
Fat-chi!
What's your opinion?
I still sense a killer's aura on him.
"Sorry, but I can't accept you!"
"Chief, I'll never leave this temple!"
"Behave yourself, this is a sacred place."
Buddhism mentions fate.
"I'm here, that's fate."
Why don't we keep him?
This will set a bad precedent.
Amida Buddha!
Mercy!
Mercy!
Shaolin was founded because of our ancestor's determinate spirit.
OK.
"We were on the roof replacing tiles when we fell through the ceiling, and luckily your bed broke our fall."
"Eric, you're in some big trouble here."
"Hey, go easy on him, I need this brother."
He taught me how to get what I want from a girl.
- Excuse me?
"- He taught me how to get a date,"
- and it worked big-time.
"- Oh, I see, and who is this girl?"
"- Uh, I don't know her name."
- You don't know her name?
"Not yet, but I'm gonna find out before I make any type of commitment."
How can you manage to ask a girl out if you don't know her name?
- All part of Eric's foolproof method.
"- Cory, get the phone."
"- Oh, Eric has a foolproof method?"
- Ring!
Ring!
"- Go ahead, Cory."
"- All right, first you pick a girl, any girl."
- Just any-ol-body.
- Yeah.
Then you pretend you're interested in her.
Now you don't really have to be interested in her.
"I thought you did, but Eric said it wasn't necessary."
- Ring!
- That's what you told him?
What?
Does it matter what I told him?
I'm dead.
You had the big sex talk with him two years ago.
What did you tell him?
- A teenage waste of space.
- A name would be nice.
"It would, wouldn't it?"
You ask a lot of questions.
Why did you compel that man to kill himself after he told me to stop looking for you?
Dramatic impact.
Wish it would've been more effective.
- Human life means that little to you?
- It means nothing to me.
It's just part of being what I am.
"No, it's not."
I know other vampires.
That's not true.
You mean your boyfriend over there by the pool table?
Stefan Salvatore.
Why Stefan?
Why didn't you go for Damon?
Or do you enjoy them both like Katherine did?
- We should be in there.
- No.
Isobel made it clear we're not to step foot inside.
- I'm not gonna kill her in a restaurant.
"- You're not gonna kill her, period."
She ruined your life.
You wanna protect her?
She's my wife.
Was.
Was my wife.
"I looked for the woman I married, but she wasn't there."
Whoever that is is cold and detached.
- Yeah.
- She's given up her humanity.
"Honey, look, it's best not to talk much about it until she's calmed down."
Is that gonna be the deal?
Sister blanche can't be annoyed with details right now?
"well, you saw how she was last night."
I saw how she was.
"Now, Iet's cop a gander at the bill of sale."
I haven't seen any.
What do you mean?
"She didn't show you papers, deed of sale, nothing like that?"
Seemed like it wasn't sold.
"well, now, what was it, then?"
Giveaway to charity?
-She'II hear you.
-I don't care if she hears me.
"-Now, Iet's see the papers."
"-Honey, there weren't any papers."
She didn't show any papers.
I don't care about papers.
Wait.
"Now, listen, did you ever hear of the napoleonic Code, stella?"
-I haven't heard of the napoleonic Code.
-AII right.
"Okay, then."
-Let me enlighten you on a point or two.
-Yes?
"Now, we got here in the state of Louisiana what's known as the napoleonic Code."
"According to which, what belongs to the wife belongs to the husband also and vice versa."
will you listen.
"Take, for instance, I had that piece of property--"
My head is swimming.
"Oh, well, all right, dear."
Okay.
You're broadcasting it that to Akan!
Enough!
Enough.
"Even if I did believe you, you still have to..."
Oh!
"Henry, no!"
No!
You brought them to my lab!
I trusted you!
"Henry, please kill me?"
Akan won't.
"He'll make me live in this straightjacket of rotten, smelly skin!"
"What the fuck was I thinking, that Akan's toy robot was my friend?"
"Thank you, Henry."
"Fuck you, too, but mostly thanks."
"My lab's compromised, but I can build a new one using Akan's equipment when we go get your wife... together, right?"
"Hey, put that on the wall."
"If I can't have my lab, no one's having her."
"Now, don't lose this."
"Fuck you, Akan."
And don't change your channel.
We're coming right over.
"Right, I counted six vehicles."
That's at least 35 men.
We've gotta cut them down to half that before they enter the hotel to give us a fighting chance to get out alive.
"Also, there's a certain stigma attached to blokes who like musicals."
I just wanna get it out there right now that I'm straight as an arrow.
Got it?
Here they come.
Wait for it.
Wait for it.
Now.
Your love blobs looked like Yul Brynner snogging Kojak.
I'm not prepared to rise to it.
Your spite and venom offends me not.
- Baldy blobs.
"- Right, that's it."
That is it.
"I hope you've got a good lawyer, because I am suing and you're going to prison forever."
"Hello, Filthy?"
"Yeah, it's Richie here."
I wanna sue Eddie.
Richie Rich.
Your client.
"I'm five foot ten, brown hair..."
"Look, it's not important."
"My minder, Edward, says that I've got bald love blobs and I want to sue."
Have I?
"Well, they're not so much bald as receding."
I'd put a wig on them for the trial.
"Bloodsucker, what do I pay you for?"
"I know I don't, it was a rhetorical question."
Goodbye forever!
He was furious.
But I persuaded him to give you a chance.
Shut up and tell me why you are wearing a hat that makes you look like you've got a toilet roll on your head.
"Because, Eddie, I have taken up the skillet and the frying pan."
I've been studying cookery all morning and I am now a master chef.
- That's why I'm wearing this great hat.
- You look like a chicken drumstick.
Ha ha!
"Wrong again because, actually, I look great."
- We are having a dinner party.
- Oh-hoo.
All right.
Welcome!
Would you like to go inside?
All right.
Bring us a bowl of hot soup and a bottle of rice wine.
You got it!
One bowl of hot soup!
All right!
Rice cakes?
It's a grand opening cake.
I hope you'll visit us often.
You're so nice.
And you're pretty too.
"Oh my, I'm blushing!"
I haven't been complimented on my looks since my teen years.
"I know you're just being nice, but you made my day."
"The papers fell down, your blouse dropped, the captain said to hang it."
- What's the matter with your mouth?
- Personal secret.
Never lets go of it.
"Six-two and even, he swallows it, his senior sorority pin."
"I peeked at your papers, and he rescued them."
You went through my papers?
The war's over.
Where are we going and why?
We don't like secrets.
Thank you. I should have known better than try to hold back f rom men who have operated the way you have behind enemy lines.
I wanted Gen. Steele to see your f aces when you heard.
Cold Steele?
It's his doing that your recommendation passed.
- Johnny's congressional?
- Congressional?
"The only thing left, is forced execution."
"I heard, from Shi Yoon..."
That what you say or what you do...
Not of it is genuine.
And that it's all part of a mission.
"All I want to do is tell you the truth, Mother."
"If you do this, you will be kicked out without compensation."
Don't listen to anything Shi Yoon says.
He said that he will be the shadow who protects this neighborhood.
"But in reality, nothing will change."
"You, as well as Shi Yoon... will lose this fight."
This is... a fight that you can't win.
Do you think so?
"Wow, this guy is really getting on my nerves."
"Why don't you stop, and turn yourselves in?"
Wow...
Here you are...
I learned from you too.
"You can't say you have nothing to do with Park Seon Woo, can you?"
"- Sir, we'll go first."
"- Sir, congratulations!"
"- Oh, sure."
Go ahead!
- Yes.
"Good work, and thank you."
"We will win, no matter what."
That's right.
Let's go.
[Neighborhood Hero]
"If we just catch Park Seon Woo, we can catch the rest of them easily."
Yong Moon Plan.
"You're operating this company, correct?"
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Ugh.
"Well, that goes beyond stupid."
Agent Gibbs.
"Is Leon coming, too?"
Assault with a deadly weapon.
You left that one out the last we talked.
"Uh, well, I was..."
I was just... just a dumb kid who-who didn't know any better.
"I mean, it wasn't that big of a deal."
You put someone in the hospital.
I'd-I'd say that was a big deal.
What's this got to do with anything?
One: you lied to me.
Two: you have the potential for violence.
"Yeah, when I was 14 years old."
"Look, I-I admit, I had some tough times as a kid, you know?"
And-And I made a mistake.
I lashed out.
"But I learned from it, and I moved on."
It never happened again.
What else don't I know?
"I told you everything, Agent Gibbs."
I didn't do this!
Why can't you just accept that?
"Because a young man is dead, and I can't accept anything yet."
"All right, that's enough."
"Michael, don't say another word."
"You should be focusing your energy on real evidence, real suspects."
Michael is a suspect.
The only person you need to be worried about is Petty Officer Brian Smith.
"UA after the crime, fight with the victim..."
I won't bother you anymore.
Bye!
You don't have to leave right off!
You just think over.
Help yourself.
- Thanks.
"Please, be careful with this."
It's fragile.
Would you mind?
- Thanks.
It's nothing special.
"I will show you, don't worry."
I told you I was a land surveyor.
This here is a theodolite.
I look through this every once in a while.
I only need to keep it unnoticed.
Why?
- I don't want them to think I'm some kind of a spy.
Have I shown you the bathroom?
- No.
"It's dilapidated, as you see."
There's no need to repair it now.
You won't have to walk through my room.
"Be sure that you lock yourself when you use the bathroom, they may break in."
I haven't told you...
Do you know that this house is going to be torn down in a month?
Of course I do.
"Why did you insist to live here, then?"
Sentimentality and other things.
I told you.
"When this happens, I'll manage myself somewhere else."
You won't have any troubles with me.
Cavemen are less primitive than you.
I'm not a flight attendant.
"You're not like that, you just got swept away."
I hope you're not back together.
"Shut up, both of you."
I haven't slept a wink in four days.
I'm going to shower and then I have to talk to you.
- About what?
- You can't shower.
- Why not?
- You're in mourning.
It's forbidden!
You can stink as much as you want.
I'm going to shower.
"Give her a break, okay?"
"Why don't you shower, too?"
I promise I won't tell Raziya.
And Dad knew all these years?
"I told you, they only just got tested, he just found out-."
How can that be?
What did...
Mom...
How?
What did she do when...
"I don't know, and it won't help to ask."
I never cease to be amazed at how little I know that loser who calls himself Dad.
And you believe his crap?
"He makes up bullshit to get us off his back forever, blood tests, my ass."
He should get an Oscar for his performances.
"A Pulitzer Prize for a sick mind, the scumbag."
We have to get the house ready tor tomorrow's guests.
I need pictures of Mom.
"So... I mean, I heard you were having a conversation... so I just basically tuned it out."
"I'm able to do that, like not hear things, so..."
Comparing instruments?
She is such an idiot.
You wouldn't believe some of the things that girl has said to me.
That was so stupid of me.
Crying.
"No, that's okay. I mean..."
"Well, see you later."
See you on the bus.
- You're taking my bus?
"- Yes, because I'm staying at Angela's."
What?
I heard about your dad.
Tough break.
"So, a girl in distress hurls herself on a guy with no life."
"It's probably just a figure of speech,""See you on the bus""."
She probably didn't mean she would actually see me.
"She just means... yes, we'll be on the same bus."
But not like together.
Right?
So you are staying at Angela's house?
- Yes.
What do you care?
- l don't.
So is her dad cooking you all kinds of good food or something?
What about Kyle?
"I mean, they've been umbilically attached for a month."
Kyle was probably her popular- jock phase.
Now she's moving into her awkward but sensitive guy phase.
- Are you saying I'm someone's phase?
- l wish I was.
Give me a break.
You told me to get in deep.
I'm in all the way.
"They didn't teach us this one in the academy, thinks I'm Batman or something."
"Yeah, well we found Robin floating in the bay with a third eye."
What do you mean?
The guy who was the manager at the ware house you were working was undercover too.
"Okasake, okasake?"
"Yeah, they thought he was campanela's man."
"Hey, thank god they didn't suspect the FBI."
"Hey, thank god they didn't suspect the FBI."
Well neither did I. Am I the next on the line?
I don't know that.
I thought we were supposed to look out for each other.
Okasake used to be yakuza.
He pissed off his elders in Honolulu.
"They down his lower teeth, so we made him a deal."
Loyalty.
You know they understand that word.
So do we.
The important thing is you didn't blow your cover.
"Yeah, no thanks to you."
We never had anyone this deep before.
We never had anyone this deep before.
"So you gotta do whatever it takes to stay in, David."
You hear me?
Whatever it takes.
"Ok, OK."
You take care of yourself.
Who sent you?
Who the fuck sent you?
Geahh!
We'll see you later.
"Come on, Mark."
Go!
"Dad, my pocket money!"
"Money, money, money..."
It's all you think about.
I thought you might like this.
Thanks Dad.
"Thanks I'm good, but thanks."
"Come on, sit down."
Stop it!
Come on!
- Morning!
- What do we got?
Dead woman's bag was found in a hotel room.
"No wallet and no phone, so no ID."
Didn't she check in?
Was checked in under the name of Ben Jackinoff.
So I think it's fair to say that's a pseudonym.
No details yet but I've got something to show you.
- Potential murder weapon?
"- Alright, I'll check that in a bit."
- We got a description of a man?
- Fairly general.
Well how was it paid for?
Didn't the hotel take a credit card swipe?
Cash and there is only CCTV on the outside of the building.
But the manager did offer us something useful.
He recalls the woman going outside to take a mobile phone call.
And it's time coded so we can trace it.
"Yeah but without knowing what network she was on, how long is that gonna take?"
Right now it's all I've got.
"What do we do now, sir?"
First we get some sack time.
Then we start all over again.
- Muldoon.
- Sir?
Check the perimeter.
Make sure the outposts are set for the night.
I guess it couldn't have been much worse.
We're still alive.
What happens now?
We keep doing our jobs.
"You got one to go back to, haven't you?"
I guess so.
What are you going to say in your newspaper?
"If I say what I feel, I may be out of a job."
We'll always give you one.
I could do you more good with a typewriter.
It's Sergeant Sooby's.
He didn't make it.
Funny thing.
Fellow takes one of these into battle and by the grace of God he comes out in one piece he carries a strange sense of guilt all the rest of his life.
JAMISON:
Colonel?
"I'd like permission to take my men into ""A"" camp to check our equipment."
"And also, that sergeant who was pretty badly hit was asking for you."
Provo?
Thank you.
Captain Johanson is taking the Mike Force back this afternoon.
You can go in with him.
- Happy to have had you aboard.
- Thanks for the ride.
Why wasn't he on the chopper?
I'm so glad to see you meeting your son!
Nim-sai!
Nim-sai...
Don't be too excited.
"Men, come and take care of Sir Ho."
"So, you've seen,"
Sir Ho admitted the accused as his son.
"This may be a deliberate conspiracy, a trap for a nullius filius."
But the witness didn't swear in front of the Bible.
"So, his words won't be accepted by the court."
He swore.
"His hands touched the Bible, but he said nothing."
"Alright, again."
"Your Honour, although such a sad thing happened, the words of the witness said before his death... should be forgotten."
Nuts!
"He did say the truth, how can you deny it?"
"Sorry, law is law."
Not any word should be amended.
"Chan Mon-gut, I can't help you."
"Your Honour, you can!"
You'd better learn again.
"Your dad died, and you don't even shed a tear."
I think I'd better learn from you.
It's all because of you!
My dad had heart disease.
"If you didn't ask him to be witness, he wouldn't have died."
"You, murderer!"
"Your Honour, I am sorry."
"My father died, I can't control my emotion."
What's up?
Damn it!
You pretend crying!
"All right, I'll be there."
"Help the guy, fatso!"
- Again.
I'm looking for Miss Guadalupe Mendoza.
- Miss Guadalupe Mendoza?
"Yes, she's here."
She was arrested for disturbing the peace and public exposure.
"You know, the community calls and we have to act, sir."
How much is the fine?
It's 200 pesos according to the law.
She has to stay here for 24 hours.
But if you want we can put her in a cell by herself.
"Shut the fuck up, whores!"
Guadalupe Mendoza?
You're going to sleep in the suite tonight.
Shut up!
"Shut up, you rowdy bitches!"
I want to tell you...
I am a Christian now and...
God spoke to me in many different ways.
For instance in a dream.
"Now I ride a cab and I preach to the people, so to speak."
I tell them to get closer to God.
I tell them you can talk to Christ in different ways.
And thanks to God I'm with him now.
What are you going to do now?
Can you come to the living room when you're done?
"Now that it's sold, why don't we use it?"
I'll be in the bedroom.
Get away from the window.
Why are we getting out through here?
- They can see you in daylight.
Yes.
Where are the plans?
"Oh, here they are, sir."
"Will you ever forgive me, sir?"
"- What for, Jeeves?"
"- For hitting you on the head, sir."
"Oh, it's all right now, Jeeves."
Everything's all right.
"Well, dash it!"
Everything's not all right.
"Jeeves, you ingrate."
"Get me out of the rough, will you?"
"I'm afraid you'll need a blacksmith for that, sir."
"We owe a great deal to you, Mr. Wooster, and to your man."
- Not at all.
It was great fun.
"- Well, thanks anyway."
I'll go and see if I can find that blacksmith for you.
- How can I ever thank you for all you've done?
- It isn't thanks I want.
It's eternal devotion and everlasting friendship.
"Do you mean that, or are you still in a daze?"
"I'm in a daze, but a wonderful daze."
"Parsons, orange blossoms, little choirboys— can you face that?"
"Yes, if you promise me you'll never speak to a strange woman again."
What are you doing?
- Sittin' down.
- Amazing.
"Oh, Jeeves, this is a very pleasant spot."
We must spend our honeymoon here.
"Not our honeymoon, sir."
Only yours.
Because my husband doubts my love for him.
And happy...?
I'm happy because the first time
"In a long time, i'm hopeful."
For us.
( music playing over stereo )
Would you dance with me?
"I just want to hold you,"
"Look into your eyes,"
"Be in love with you,"
And feel you being in love with me.
Would you?
The most beautiful song
For the most beautiful woman.
"- You got this, girl."
This is your special... and you're special.
"Ugh, yuck."
"Well, it'll be great."
- You sure about that?
- What did you say to me?
- I asked if you're sure about your performance.
You don't seem that confident.
"- Well, what do you know?"
- I know a lot.
I'm you.
"I just don't want you to get so nervous that you mess up, like that one time in show choir when you auditioned for a solo and they couldn't hear your voice because you had one of those inside farts."
"You know, like one of those farts that's like--"
"- Yeah, I know."
Why are you bringing this up now?
You don't have to be so rude.
- I'm not being rude.
- Tonight?
"- Oh, no, I can't."
I've got to meet my mom at the hospital.
- Want company?
"- No, I'm good."
'Cause we're here for you if you need us.
"He knows that, Brian."
Good.
"I can't count the times I wished you dead, miserable son of a bitch."
Literally can't count the times.
"Let me tell you, I always thought you'd outlive me."
You were always so full of damn life.
Used to piss me off.
"Goddamn sparkle in your eye just like the day I met you, like you were still 21."
I used to imagine you outliving me.
"Standing over my grave, getting cigar ashes on my headstone."
Terrible.
But here we are.
Looks like I'm outliving you.
I spent the last 25 years of my life hating you.
25?
"No, at least 27."
Do I regret it?
Not for a second.
"You and I weren't always nice to each other, but we never, ever lied to each other."
Now who am I supposed to hate?
Probably my mom.
"Can you believe she's still alive, making everybody miserable?"
"God, who sent you these ugly carnations?"
"Stink hands, yeah, figures."
"I'm sorry it didn't work out between us, Frank."
You weren't a bad guy.
like a shoelace.
That's pretty resourceful.
I know.
"All right, you're good."
I just can't believe he's gone.
Yeah.
And for what?
For trying to save a guy like John Cutler?
"Now, listen to me, all right?"
"Billy saw somebody in danger, and he reacted, all right?"
That's what he did.
And the fact that he knew the kind of man that Cutler was and he still put himself in harm's way?
"He was a hero, Catherine."
Yeah.
(knocks)
I just got off the phone with the lab.
There's something you're both gonna want to see.
What do you got?
"Well, there were no prints on any of the shell casings from our shooter's gun."
But the lab did find traces of blood on one of the slugs from Billy's gun.
Wait a minute.
Billy hit the shooter?
Apparently.
That's my boy.
It must've been a through-and-through.
I bet the slug was imbedded in the cabin wall and our cleaner dug it out.
You run the blood?
"Yeah, we got a match, too."
Our killer's a guy by the name of
Jason Kroll.
He's believed to be a hit man.
"HPD had him as a suspect in two homicide cases last year, but couldn't make anything stick."
My bread!
My bread!
How was it?
"They just think about eating, and don't even see a car coming."
How do parents teach them?
"The reason I asked to see you is that, next month there will be personnel changes."
Were you aware?
Please help me.
I believe you are the only member that can help me.
Am I?
"I thought you had backups, aside from me, since you have control over the 3 billion Won welfare assets."
You seem different.
It's... a little difficult.
"Since civilians are complaining that the children are starving, we'll just have to work harder."
There must be a way.
"Just a bunch of numbers, nothing difficult."
Not like it's never been done before right?
I'll just believe you.
Go on.
"Thank you, Yun Seong."
"Oh, is your injury hurting?"
Wh-what are you doing?
"Really, I'm fine."
Put me down.
"Really, there's nothing wrong."
Put me down.
You can put me down now.
How come it's so high?
"What is this, graffiti?"
My height measurements.
"From when I moved here at 7 years old, until I was 17."
My father measured my height there.
"- I need more to work with, much more."
- There is no more.
Lucas was drunk and brutal.
"When he tried to beat me, I killed him."
Killing in self-defense is understandable.
"But you hid the body, like a criminal."
- I know.
- She was fighting for her life.
The state is sending a prosecutor for one purpose: to convict Selena.
I've seen him work.
He's thoroughly competent and relentless as law itself.
Tell her to come in.
There must be something you haven't told me.
"- He tried to kill me, I killed him first."
- But you hid the body!
Why?
"Come in, Allison."
Allison.
I was never happier to see anyone in my life.
Are you all right?
"- Hi, Ted."
"- Hi, Allison."
I can testify about Lucas.
I saw him beat her.
"It'll help, believe me."
- We appreciate you coming back.
"- You'll get her off, won't you?"
We're gonna do the best we can.
But the jury decides on the one thing: evidence.
"Now, it adds up to this:"
"We have a murder, and a defense that's too simple to be good."
It's open to attack from many sides.
Continuing with the treatment would be meaningless.
"Moreover, your current medical fees are costly enough."
I will definitely come up with the money in one month.
"Therefore... please, you must definitely save him."
I absolutely can't let go of my dad like this.
He has been in a coma for 10 years.
Maybe it's time to give up.
"Because of me, my dad is like that."
"I can't give up, I can't."
Doctor!
Please save him.
I'm begging you!
Please save him.
Please save my father.
Please save him.
"Hello everybody, I'm from life beverage company."
I sell hangover drinks.
We are currently having a free trial for our product.
"To participate, you just need to go to our website."
"These don't really work, right?"
"It's a lie, right?"
There's no such thing.
People who have tried this drink say that their stomachs feel a lot better the very next day.
"No, thanks."
We don't need it.
Don't be like this.
Sounds good.
Let's give it a try.
Thank you.
"One bottle, two bottles."
"Hello, It's Kim Na Na."
Right now?
Is that all right?
"Ok, good bye."
- Is the Director in?
- Go see his secretary.
Take this to the boss's car.
Is the director in?
Don't you know how to say hello?
"Yes, sorry."
Is he in?
- He's not seeing anyone right now.
- He called me.
- Who are you?
"- Balla Traoré, from the factory."
"Right, Balla from the factory, he's expecting you."
It's the office on the right.
"You're late, I was leaving..."
Have a seat.
- Any news?
- Everything's all right.
I got the quarterly report.
"Truth is, this factory is going from bad to worse in red ink, according to a report made before you arrived."
"But right now, we need to keep up appearances at all costs."
"A rich man nowadays, is like the crap that... bees feed on."
"They get pleasure, but at the same time it makes them cry."
"200 workers will be laid off, among this mass of lazy bums."
"200, that's too many!"
"The factory will produce, I'll take care of it."
You have my trust.
- Here's the sack.
- Leave it there.
That's everything.
You owe me 215 FM.
Can I take a message?
Oh...
OK.
Bye.
Some foreign bloke says he makes tasty crackling and you shouldn't be afraid.
- What's that all about?
- It's... just... a mate.
He's a chef.
Wants me to try a new recipe.
See?
I don't know any fancy foreign chefs.
Don't tell me it's not exciting living in London.
It's not exciting living in London.
"- Oh, come on."
It must be.
- It's not.
It's like some huge ant hill where nothing works properly.
Millions of people just getting in each other's way.
"No space, no air."
"So, why don't you leave?"
"I'm trying, but it's hard."
"With money it's bearable, but if you're skint, you're trapped."
Try living here.
"Everybody knows you, knows everything about you."
"Nothing changes, nothing ever happens."
"Their idea of a good time is getting shit-faced as quickly as possible and then shag anyone who'll let them, and then do it all again tomorrow."
"Now, that's being trapped."
To escaping.
To escaping.
"And a big, fat win on the lottery."
- What?
- I was just thinking about Wicklow.
The Russian women.
Get away.
"Here, try the end window, where the candy is."
"Come on, Hoffy,we all want to see."
- How'd he get over there?
-Easy.
"Walked through the gate, past the guard, like he was some Kraut field marshal."
Now we know what he got for the radio.
This is murder.
"The stinking miser, keeping all that for himself."
"So I'm a vigilante, huh?"
"So, what are the officers gonna do now?"
"Don't worry, we'll handle it from here."
"Well, you'd better handle it fast, before he sells us all down the river."
Hi.
Too late for chow?
"What's the matter, boys?"
My slip showing?
I'll say it is.
You spilled a little borscht on it.
Borscht?
- Did you have a good time over there?
-Oh.
Somebody was peeking.
"Yeah, had a dreamy time."
"Those dames, they really know how to throw a party."
"I've known some women in my time, but between you and me there's nothing like the hot breath of the Cossacks."
There are a couple of blond snipers over there.
Real man-killers.
They--
What's this?
"What happened, Cookie?"
I took my petition to Cowell and you know what he did?
"He didn't listen, because he don't care about people, he don't care about the town."
I think we'd be better off without him!
This smells rotten to me.
"Exactly, Dermot."
This looks fucking weird!
"Save it for the county jail, sister."
Right...
Exactly.
"Wheel me out of here, Dermot."
"Get out of here, come on!"
We've got Scrabble class.
"I'm going to open the door for you, because I feel sorry for you, because this is so Goddamn pathetic!"
I don't want your pity!
Just try and...
I just want your answers.
Don't you cross me!
Don't you cross me!
You're both embarrassing.
"The rope's too tight, I can't feel my feet, I need to go to the toilet."
Let's just come to some kind of amicable agreement.
I'm a very influential man.
Here we are.
This is Jessie J's place.
Wow!
"Yeah, she was my sensei growing up, she taught me everything I know."
Back in the day?
"Way back in the day, O'Leary."
You must remember one thing...
Mm-hmm?
"A relationship with a sensei is based on truth, honour and power."
I need to see you perform a power stance.
Then you calmed down.
You're stubborn!
Why are you telling me these Jewish fairytales?
I can be stubborn too.
You shouldn't have brought that snake here.
"Bonbons, he brings me."
"He was my friend, he should've been on my side."
Maybe he's trying to fix something.
"I did things that were wrong, Goni."
I know that.
"I wanted to get what was coming to me, no matter how."
But what I did is disproportional to the punishment and to your suffering.
All of ours.
All of our little family.
I carry it with me all the time.
"You know, a few days ago I bumped into someone I knew in 2nd grade."
She used to say I was from a family of thieves.
And that you stole our fridge from the theater.
She can drop dead.
"She can drop dead, I don't care about her."
And I don't care what people said or what happened.
"Your mother and I always thought that you, little one, deserved a better life."
You didn't deserve all this.
I miss Mommy so much.
Mommy is dead.
You're here and I'm here.
Then they started fighting over it.
And?
Then they pulled it from each other and it tore.
And?
Then I told them to stop.
So you became a judge?
You're welcome.
Sorry.
- Are you well?
"- Fine, thanks."
Sorry to disturb you.
"You're welcome, it's my route."
I'll take you.
I often see you on this road.
- You're not a local?
- No.
You seem to have problems.
One problem!
"In any case, every affair has its own problems."
Anything over a hundred years old is considered an antique.
What are you talking about?
You don't work underground?
"Because of this bone, you think we're looking for treasure or antiques?"
I don't think that.
I'm almost sure of it.
You haven't come for the ceremony?
The cat's out of the bag!
Our crew was joking with the kid.
They said that we've come for treasure.
We didn't want people to know why we're really here.
His family lives in the village.
It's a small village too.
That's why he believed it.
"Later, we told him the secret."
"When I was little, I felt the same."
"Whenever someone told me a secret, I always wanted to tell others."
"And in the end, I would."
I think I enjoyed telling it more than I enjoyed keeping it.
"""Entrepreneur rises from the ashes."""
"Now, I'm just going to be in The Times, looking like a stupid ash."
"Shoot, girl, just push on through."
"I'm pushing, girl."
I am pushing.
(both) Excuse us.
Excuse us.
Excuse us.
"Just go, girl."
I don't want anybody else to get those two yellow dresses.
"Max, did you hear that?"
Someone has worst taste than Sophie.
Now we just have to hang back here and let them get to those dresses first.
Yay!
My life is good again.
"Max, Caroline, up here."
"What was that, like, a second?"
I saved you a space upfront.
Come on.
"Well, it's over."
"As soon as they cut that ribbon,"
Sophie's going to Marshawn Lynch everyone who gets in the way of us and those dresses.
There's only one way out of this.
And you called it earlier.
You have to let them trample you.
I'm serious.
I'm not about to be trampled on purpose.
See if you still feel that way after I say these next few words:
"""Pictured from left, Caroline Channing."""
Try to fend off any heels you see heading for my eyes.
"Attention, ladies."
"As you see, I have the big scissors, which can only mean it's time... to trim some nose hairs!"
Don't fret.
I just lick the alphabet.
"A, B, C..."
"Nothing wrong with that, is there?"
"No, but..."
I thought you were thinking about me.
"I thought about a letter, then you, and then a new letter."
Don't discuss such matters with him.
I didn't say I was going to lick you.
Just licking in general.
"Of course I was going to lick you, but your name wasn't mentioned."
- All right.
- Let's go home.
Well done.
"- Hi, Mads."
"- Peter, isn't it?"
- Good game?
- Fine.
"Frank, I looked into that matter."
"Judging by what you told me,   the woman sold you that picture with intent to defraud."
The law clearly states that any transaction is invalid   if the seller had fraudulent intentions.
She knew you thought the picture was mouth and not hand-painted.
"When you reveal the fraud, the sale is invalid."
- You can demand your money back.
- I'm going to the car.
Bye.
Anyway...
"If you want to, you can sue her."
- Just say the word.
I'm off.
"- Okay, Mads."
- See you.
"When I saw you there, I just lost control."
Who are you?
!
I saw the magazine.
I'm really not that kind of person!
Just five minutes.
Let me talk to you?
"I can understand why you are worried because perverts might call you or write you letters,"
but I'm not like that.
So warm.
Just leave me alone.
I'm not that kind of woman.
I'm not a porn model and never have been.
I'm not like that.
I'm not that kind of woman.
I'm not!
Excuse me?
I have to lock the toilets shortly.
What do you think you are doing in my room?
I'm a manager of this apartment.
I can come in.
Can you please leave now?
There's been a lot of female underwear stolen from around here lately.
And?
"And what's more, the daughter of Mr Yamashita who lives across the road, says you often peek into her room."
Have you got any evidence?
I have a proper girlfriend.
Why would I be interested in that school girl?
Look at that.
You've made a stain on the wall.
Are you cleaning the room properly?
That was there when I moved in.
"Well, I'm not exactly winning any prizes either."
Damn it!
"You give him a restraining order, and he's mocking you!"
"He was... ""And what do I do about going to the bathroom""?"
(MR. WHlTTEMORE continues yelling)
So why do we need their help?
Because it's harder to kill than I thought.
I still don't know who it is.
And they do?
They might.
Which is why I need one of you to get on their good side.
"Hmm, Scott or Stiles?"
Either.
"You know, the full moon's coming, Derek."
I'm aware of that.
"My, these look comfortable."
You said you were gonna teach us to change whenever we wanted.
There hasn't been time.
"But if you have to lock us up during the full moon, that means you're alone against the Argents."
They haven't found us.
Yet!
So how about we forget the Kanima?
We can't!
But there was something about the way Gerard looked at it.
He wasn't afraid...
At all.
I don't know what he knows or what he's planning.
But I'm sure about one thing.
We have to find it first.
allison:
It's everything Lydia can translate.
"And trust me, she was very confused."
I know.
But thank you.
It's a joy to have you.
Richard Whiteley!
You've ruined my life!
Thanks very much.
"Earlier on I was told to go and break the world caravan speed record, which stands at 128mph."
And I failed.
So I had another go.
"With the window repaired to Aerospace standards, caravan glory is within Lee's grasp."
This time the cross winds have built up.
The caravan starts to fishtail.
Lee keeps his nerve and keeps his foot to the floor.
He hits 125.2mph. That looks great for a new record.
Just 5mph more.
There's plenty of runway left.
"But then, oil and smoke everywhere."
This doesn't look good.
"I'm not an engineer, but I'd say it was mullered."
"I think the piston's gone, or low on fuel,"
I'm not sure.
We can't have another go then?
Not with this car.
There you go.
"BBC Top Gear, the world's anti-caravan organisation defeated by a 20-year-old Abbey GT214."
It's pathetic.
I wonder if James May realises.
We don't tolerate failure on Top Gear.
It's not an option.
Maybe he doesn't know about the tank of piranhas.
He'll be in it if he doesn't get it right.
Right.
What Solomon?
May be I'm a schizophrenic indeed but I can still tell a dream from reality.
If you weren't such a cynic you'd tell what is real and what is not.
If you had just a bit of faith you'd find the key to your problems.
What advice can I give you?
Turn to a doctor or to a prosecutor.
I feel unwell.
A medic!
I have nightmares.
"You're too busy, King."
You should take more rest and enjoy yourself more.
Change your wives more often.
You have the same advice for every cause.
I need a real cure.
There is one effective cure from your illness.
It is a sacrifice to Moloch.
Moloch is waiting for fresh blood.
I am not a pagan.
Moloch is the only one who can help you.
Try it!
"Yes, everything has been performed and signed."
Goodbye.
Whom did you call?
Nobody.
Why aren't you sleeping?
I see Solomon and police in my dreams.
What police?
What Solomon?
You need to have a good sleep.
I'm very tired.
I'll be upstairs.
The cerebral cortex is not damaged.
"If he gets out of line again, I will be back."
Keep it!
Ahem.
"Excuse me, Mr. Reed."
Mrs. Laws is waiting for you.
You wanted to see me?
"Well, you've done it this time, Mr. Reed."
What did I do?
Look.
"Louis, what happened to you?"
You.
You're the one filling his head up with all this junk.
"We have taught this boy to stand up for himself... to fight the bullies, but he doesn't listen to us."
"He said, ""Mr. Reed teaches us differently."
"""Mr. Reed said that we should run from the bullies..."""
"and that Mr. Reed encourages the smaller kids... to practice running, hiding, and eating their lunch quickly!"
"I didn't say ""quickly."" I said ""rapidly."""
- I was trying to help.
"- Well, thanks to your help... every bully at this school is beating him up."
A younger girl did this to him!
"Mr. Reed, have you ever stood up to anybody?"
"Or better yet, have you ever had your butt..."
"Mrs. Williams, I'll handle it from here."
"Mr. Reed, may I remind you... that you are just a substitute teacher?"
No more of this.
I was simply talking about how life is.
I don't care.
Teach only from the books and not your philosophy on life.
That's all for now.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
Uncle Charlie?
Anybody home?
This is Charles Garrisons secretary calling from Hybra Tech...
Mr. Garrison will be working late again tonight and will see you sometime tomorrow.
Stay out of trouble and Julian still needs to mould the lawn.
Where the hell are you guys?
You scared the shit out of me.
You should look into that.
I brought you something to eat.
Way to go Zeke!
Now get out of the way and let me show you how it's really done.
I want to see Acho finally get it right.
"No, that's cool."
Don't be chicken-shit.
"Look at Pyro, he did it and he's a little kid."
You know what they say...
If you fall of a horse you gotto get right back on.
"What they say, if you eat dirt after falling of 6 meters..."
Like he did last week?
You can do it.
"We are all about trust, right Bro?"
"That a boy, show these Barneys how to catch some air."
Shit!
What are you doing?
Center the tire and the ramp does the work for you...
I told you to be one with the bike.
I know how to do it.
"Damm, where are you head theses days boy?"
What you got on your mind?
"Lead, follow or get out of the way."
You alright?
He's out.
"Thank you, Nicky."
"Dragan, how would you describe your life?"
Well...
"Everything happens differently, you know."
Nothing was what I wanted it to be.
You are perhaps the only one who knows that is true.
But now I just try...
To feel felt pain.
And it would be enough for me now.
Describe the pain.
"Do not ask me this, please."
Remember picker?
Of course I remember it.
I and you have lived the whole war.
Do you remember when you called me and you told me not to get out?
Why do you ask me if I remember it?
- Why did not you want it to go out?
What do you think I did not do?
"It would launch my career, but I heard you."
And I did not quit it.
You...
You just...
Did something that no one else would have done.
And  I...
I can not believe you did it.
"All right, I admit it."
"I tried to convince Dragan to get him out, but I did not succeed."
My chosen movie shooter will never see the light.
But the king had listened carefully to every word.
You do not like it?
- Yes I like it.
"That's just the beginning, try again."
Ok.
"Maybe there was some truth in there, but..."
You know what?
"You're seeing who I am, who I really am, after all these years, and that's a good thing."
It's really important for me not to know anything about you.
I don't wanna know that you're an alcoholic or that you killed a guy and had sex with my mother.
You're my therapist.
I need to think of you as superman.
"I can't think of you as drinking and crying and screwing and killing and then ask you to help me with my fear of spiders, you know?"
Yes.
I'm erasing the events of last night from my mind.
You should too.
"- Oh, they're barely there."
- Good.
So last night never happened.
"Hey, boys!"
Now you know my day job.
What can I get yous?
No booze for you.
You have a problem.
I'm not gonna be your enabler.
The meatloaf's good.
Oh!
"Hey, hi!"
I got here as fast as I could.
"I drove like a teenager on coke, but I'm here for you, just like you are for me."
- Great.
How did you know?
- How did I know?
That we were stranded and where we are.
- Dr. storper.
"- Well, you called me, or some woman named Shasta called me and handed you the phone."
"No, sorry."
"I was looking for, what are the ovaries?"
"Oh, the o..."
"Yeah, I always mix those two up."
Try not to.
Your future will be brighter.
Can you tell us anything about ovulation or how pregnancy occurs?
"Well, the man's got the sperm, and the woman's got the egg."
"Now, once a month, an egg slides down the Philippine tube towards the uterus."
"The first sperm to reach the egg wins, it gets a medal, it's born, you name him Cory, you push him out the door, and nothing makes sense for the rest of his life."
Congratulations.
You seem to have a thorough understanding of the life cycle.
"- Hey, I live it."
- Any questions?
Yes?
How do you get a girl to say hi?
Michael and Lisa Marie?
- Looks like it.
- Since when?
- Just now.
That was it.
"- What, that?"
- Yeah.
You saw it happen.
- I can't believe it.
"I saw it happen, and I still don't know how it happens."
"Stop obsessing, man."
You're gonna pop a lobe.
You're right.
"I should relax, 'cause this coupling thing, it's just a phase."
"I mean, how long can it last..."
a few weeks?
- Won't you reconsider?
"- You were a hopeless doctor, but you're a brilliant coward."
The rats are deserting the sinking ship.
But no great loss - he was hardly a scientific genius.

You're guaranteed to go to heaven.

- Stop it.

Padre Miguel.
"Look, they're here."
Let's just hope that they won't harm the ones who've stayed.
"Padre Miguel, that's the guerrilleros, isn't it?"
- How could we forget about you?
- Help me.
- They mustn't find out who you are.
- We should take off his uniform.
Up here.
We've got injured people out there.
"We need beds, a nurse, and most of all antibiotics."
"I'm sorry, but the doctor isn't here."
He was scared.
He fled.
- And we've only got two vacant beds.
- I need three beds.
Jaime!
- You can't do this.
- This man is injured.
Show some sympathy.
- He's in the militia.
- How cruel!
- Get him out.
You know what?
Just go.
Seriously.
"Okay,the band rents the rehearsal space."
It's not like we're meeting in somebody's basement.
Are you not attracted to me?
What?
!
"I just can't help thinking if I was some hot,tatted-up 22-year-old, maybe rehearsal wouldn't seem so important right now."
This is insane.
"I mean,I know I've gained a little weight, but it's not like I'm not going to lose it."
"I just have to be careful because of my food issues, and,yes,maybe I have a tra of body dismorphic disorder again, but whatever."
Who doesn't?
I have to go.
You're so grossed out right now!
"I am not grossed out,okay?"
I'm just late.
Don't leave me!
What is with you tonight?
I don't know!
I don't know...
Fine.
Let's go take a freakin' bath and figure it out.
Come on.
Let's go make raising fingers.
"Baby,the MySpace page is just for the band."
You have nothing to worry about.
I can't believe you were stalking me on MySpace.
"Hey,would you mind washing my back?"
Mind?
I'd pay good money to wash that back.
Come here.
How can one help abhorring these men and their religion?

I have a messenger in mind.
"I tell ya, lads."
Have no fear.
"I look into the eyes of evil and I come through unscathed, right?"
All of you!
Stop your mumbling about ghosts and demons.
Get to work!
Ya see?
They don't doubt me!
"I don't doubt you eitherer, jacob."
He's been muttering all night.
Something about a man coming to set us free.
It's the fever.
It's healing.
Thank you.
Excuse me!
You're a woman.
"You have a keen eye, mister..."
- crusoe.
Yes.
Oooh!
Erie!
"Any part of 1,000 at 72?"
You want me to start buying?
At 72?
I should say not.
I've passed the word that i'm not gonna buy until the price goes down.
In a few days it'll be a flat as a flounder.
The board of directors of the erie railroad wish to announce that they have declared a dividend on all outstanding stock of 50%.
Whoever heard of a 50% dividend?
"Nobody, but it makes erie the best buy on the market."
"Any part of 1,000 at 72?"
50%!
I smell a rat.
A little bald-headed one with chin whiskers.
73!
73!
You don't know how lucky you are.
His brains is gonna pull you through.
I didn't think drew was smart enough to find a new way to start a bull rush.
But i'm gonna fight him.
Go ahead and buy.
But it's a false price!
"False as wooden teeth, but the suckers are falling for it, and the only way to beat drew is to get control."
"No matter what it costs, i can make the railroad worth it when i'm boss."
"But commodore, i don't think- go ahead, buy."
"While we've been gabbing here, it's gone up 3 points."
Vanderbilt's buying.
Vanderbilt's buying.
Erie's up to 83!
83!
Good to see you.
All right.
"Let's all get back to work, for chrissake, okay?"
"In my office, man."
Let's see what you bozos been up to lately.
You okay?
Hanging in?
What's it look like?
- What's this from A.P.D?
- Been checking with them to see if they come across that famous blue meth of yours.
"Sure enough, last night."
Got themselves an honest-to-God dealer.
I was thinking of cruising over and saying hello.
Maybe you'd like to go with me?
Yeah.
"Well, all right."
"You told me to my face you weren't a cop, man."
I feel manipulated.
I thought we were gonna hang out.
"We are hanging out, Badger."
You like Badger or Brandon?
"I like people who don't, like, abuse the Constitution."
"Badger, listen."
Hey.
"I'm trying to help you here, man."
"Now, if you just tell me who your supplier is I think this can end very well for you."
"What are you doing, detective, talking to my client without me present?"
You sneaky Pete.
Which is which?
"What, did the academy hire you right out of the womb?"
You guys get younger every...
What'd you say to baby face?
"Last time I was up here, it was with some soccer player named Eli."
Is something bothering you?
Am I that obvious?
"The one thing you're not is obvious, Chad."
I got the pages for tomorrow's shoot.
I have three lines.
Three.
I was nominated for a Daytime Emmy and now they're treating me like some day player.
"OK, we've parked at inspiration point so you can bitch about your job?"
- I thought we were friends.
"- I don't know what we are, Chad."
You give me shoes.
You admire my body and...
"You know, I'm sorry."
"Taking a drive to a beautiful location is, regardless of categories, a date."
"Come on, man."
"Driving me all the way up here, you're either gonna hack me into pieces or you're gonna kiss me."
"Well, I'm not a serial killer, so..."
Wait.
Wait.
So you are gay.
"No, man."
But it doesn't mean I don't think you're hot.
Wait.
What about your girlfriend?
She doesn't mind.
I've seen her make out with tons of girls.
"Well, who am I to judge?"
"He shows up for his interview and I swear to you, his face did not move."
- No.
"- No, not an inch."
- Botox?
Um ...
"No, thank you."
Don't you like cookies?
"Yea, but ..."
I feel kinda bad now.
Don't be ridiculous.
Are those oatmeal ?
"Thanks, mister."
What's wrong ?
"Wait a minute, did you put something in these ?"
Why are you looking at us funnny ?
"No, no...no"
It's just that you girls are not what I expected.
We didn't picture you either.
Keeps life interesting I guess.
Do you've any milk ?
I hate to interrupt or anything but... don't you think you girls should better reload ?
"Excuse me, but what is your deal ?"
I rather not discuss it.
Why not?
"That's my business, that's why why not."
What's the big...
I thought for sure they'll send professionals.
They did !
Then why is that matter I don't want to discuss ?
Wouldn't you be curious if you were us?
There's a place around the corner if you need more ammo.
We got ammo!
Then let's get this show on the road!
I'm expecting company.
What kind of company ?
I'd rather not say.
"I'm not wasting your time, am I?"
I lost my job.
I screwed up and word got out to the whole industry.
No one wants to hire me.
So I'm free everyday.
"I should say that's great, right?"
So you can rest.
Okay?
No more black circles around your eyes.
I retouched under my eyes for you.
I will erase the rash for you too doc.
Actually our occupations have a lot in common.
I don't know if you still want to die.
"But you are not allowed to, got it?"
You must get better.
Okay?
"""The way you look at someone says more than words."
"And feelings sometimes cannot be explained."""
Shit!
How did he come up with that?
So warm and romantic.
My work at the center of Shibuya #IloveAdidas #MomIdidit
Jerd you make Thai people proud.
Wow you've come a long way my friend.
Congratulations bro.
It looks like a funeral in black and white.
My boyfriend wants it more dreamy.
What do you mean dreamy?
You know dreamy.
The fact you took these at the park is lame.
Don't tell me you want pink grass too.
Just do it to make him happy.
"Well, I guess that's better than some stupid doll."
- Hey.
"- Dude, I am so screwed."
I'm so glad it's you and not my mom.
Or my brothers.
Or my sister.
Or indeed my half-sister.
Could my life get any more complicated?
- What's up?
- Did you even hear what I said?
A countdown clock.
Dan Silk is counting out the days until I come out on his frigging website.
"""Chad Berry."
"Come out, come out, wherever you are."" That son of a bitch."
What I can't figure out is why is this guy gunning for me?
"Oh, no."
You called him.
Yes.
"Yes, I did."
I thought I could convince him to leave you alone.
You think you're the first lawyer to try and scare this asswipe?
He makes his living from screwing with people's lives.
You just egged him on!
You promised you wouldn't do anything.
I come from a line of people who are incapable of leaving well enough alone.
"If you had any respect for how important my career is to me, you would have listened and not gone behind my back."
You're right.
You're absolutely right.
I'm sorry.
I am sorry.
So... where do we go from here?
I'll tell you where we won't go.
Time drew it...
This rainbow of desires...
"What happened, uncle?"
Smile once.
"Today, Tony's dream will come true."
He likes to play with me.
Silence heard by the heart.
Doctor told me that I can play now.
He must be very happy.
"Do you have any dreams, uncle?"
It's alright.
What's the fun if each one fulfills his own dream?
The fun lies in fulfilling others' dreams.
Are you the meaning of life?
It's said that God lives in children.
It seems to be true on seeing them.
Each one of them has a disease.
They forget all the sorrows and feel very happy since one of them has defied death.
Some of them will not survive inspite of good medication.
But some will survive.
But there is no money.
Look at him.
He will not survive for more than 4 days.
He too knows that.
But he forgot that  is happy that she has survived  he can play with her.
Who has disease?
We or they?
So many of them?
"If there are so many of them in our orphanage alone, think about the entire city, state  the country."
How many are there?
I need a list of all those children.
We went pillar to post to save one child.
what's it really about?
I want to become the person my mother can be proud of...
The person I can be proud of.
"Well, for the record, you made a believer out of me."
"You know, this would make one hell of a story."
"No, no."
I am a private detective.
"No, thanks."
Thank you.
"- Hey, you."
- Hey.
Just came to make sure you were okay.
I get it now.
"By rescuing Amanda, you were saving a part of yourself."
"I guess if you want to have a future, you have to make amends with your past, right?"
And you're off to a flying start.
You want to get something to eat?
"Uh, thanks, but I have to take my mother to dinner."
I told her I needed to clear the air.
I predict a complete success.
You don't know my mother.
But I know you...
And I am always in your corner.
"Am I moving your stuff to my place all alone, or are you gonna help me?"
I'm helping.
I'm packing memories.
You know I actually five pounds lighter than I was in high school?
Do you know that none of your glasses actually match?
I don't even know how a person does that.
"Hey, same haircut, you ask?"
"Same barber, I say."
- You don't have to do this.
- Please.
- Please.
It will be safer if you stay quiet.
BROYLES:
Her name's Christine Hollis.
"Twenty-seven years old, in the master's program for fine arts at BU."
"Far as we can tell, she's no one special."
"Parents deceased, no siblings, no arrests."
Twenty-seven hundred dollars in her bank account.
- Nothing unusual at all.
- Do we have a home address?
We're working on it now.
Assuming she's still alive.
We have no reason yet to think otherwise.
"Well, that's just it, isn't it?"
We don't know what to think.
I'm lost.
"Twenty-four years ago, one of them saved Walter and Peter."
Walter doesn't know why.
Can't remember.
"But beyond that, everything we know about these guys the little that there is, suggests that they just watch."
They don't get involved.
But now...
Figure out why he took this girl.
What makes her the exception?
"Do that, and I think you'll find him."
PETER:
"Hey, I think we may have a lead on the Observer."
"Walter, look at this."
In his book.
I think that might be blood.
You must really suffer from the terrifying clarity of your vision.
Thank you.
I do suffer.
Thank you.
Take a look at this screenplay.
I kind of dashed it off.
It's about the New York poet Frank O'Hara.
He had a beautiful nose like a boxer.
"Yeah, I know."
I love his nose.
He got run over by a dune buggy on Fire Island.
"Anyway, I'd like you to think about doing a rewrite on this."
- George has my number.
- Thank you for this opportunity.
I love your work and I can't wait to read this.
Thanks.
Did you have this script made for me?
My name's on the cover.
Now when you give someone a script to read it's kind of standard practice to laser print their name on every page.
I see.
"This is not a big deal, but my name is misspelled."
"There's no ""O"" at the end."
"It's ""Jonathan"", not ""Jonathon""."
"Yeah, man, I don't know."
It's not really important.
But call me tomorrow and it's really great to meet you.
Great to meet you.
"Thank you, Jim Jarmusch."
Do you know Jim Jarmusch?
He's my favorite director of all time.
His films are like poems that come to life.
It's really interesting.
"With that planning to kill wife, throwing bombs on police, and escaping to Malaysia on fake passports."
Go and tell her.
What's this man?
Game.
Is it good?
"He's not a patient, he has no memory loss."
He has memory loss.
"Being a doctor, I say this."
"No, he has no memory loss."
He has memory loss.
"No, he doesn't have memory loss."
Trust me.
"He told me what had happened 2 years back, and also told me that he doesn't remember that."
"He told me what had happened 2 years back, and also told me that he doesn't remember that...?"
"Actually, he told me that I am a doctor."
Aren't you a doctor?
It's okay you knew it.
But don't tell him.
He will beat me to pulp.
Hey you patient...
Where were you?
Did you find anything about him?
I found everything about him.
What?
Does he remember his past?
I saw my future.
Don't play with him.
He will cover your face and beat you up.
Stop talking nonsense.
Are you playing games with me?
Everyone thinks they have started the game.
"But actually, we are all players in his game."
Excuse me for barging in on you so soon after a long trip.
That's no problem.
I touched this up on the train back from Kyoto.
"You may not find it suitable for a textbook, but here you go."
When can I get paid?
Soon.
"Scholars don't live on air, you know."
We'll get it to you as soon as we can.
"Come to think of it, would you send it to my school?"
Huh?
"Oh, I understand."
You have to put more expression into it.
"Ah, they're dancing."
"Yes, I'll go tell her you're home."
"Like this, see."
Mother!
Father's here!
Oh?
"Shinako, go say hello to your father."
"Namiko, are you asleep?"
Excuse me.
"That kimono looks really good on you, Mother."
Is that right?
I'll tell you about clothes.
"Before the war, lacquer and colourful prints sold really well."
That's right.
Those are luxury goods.
"If a woman wore a luxurious kimono during the war, a woman exposed her asarakasa."
It would have been the picture of vulgarity.
"Father, you have a morning lecture, don't you?"
"Yes, but go on ahead."
I see.
Excuse me.
Is everything okay?
Everything's not okay.
- Hold on.
You give him an hour with the actors?
That's a joke.
Stop and think before you open your mouth and don't tell me it's a joke.
So that's why it is in the makeup room?
"Do it in the stairwell, for all I care."
Stop overreacting.
You're doing it wrong.
Then tell me how to do it.
"He's here after so many years and is so excited, you could at least give him a proper welcome."
"Believe me, I tried."
- I don't believe you.
"After he got out of jail,"
I asked him to direct in the basement hall.
He got up and left.
"I fought with everyone who didn't want to see his face in this building, and there were lots, there still are."
"You deserve a medal, Alex."
"- The next day, he changed his mind."
"Maybe Mother spoke with him, I don't know."
But he called and said he'd accept my offer.
I sent him the play.
"It was small, but it was a gem."
We chose the cast and scheduled a rehearsal.
"He stuttered, lashed out at the actors, came unprepared, the actors said they wouldn't work with him."
That was a long time ago.
What about the big stage?
Why not there?
"Hello, Yitzhak."
Zeltzer.
Debriefing at 10:00am.
"Stop it, no one will be up at 10.00am. Not even youl"
Wanna bet?
No.
"You'd lose, there's no point."
"By the way, I owe you 10 euros."
I thought you were a heavy sleeper -
I've been ringing your bell for 10 minutes.
Get lost.
I should be the one who's angry.
"Since you lost the case, you pretended to be into me while running after Ronaldo on the sly."
I didn't suddenly become your type overnight.
Why are you doing this?
What do you gain by sleeping with me?
And you?
Fifteen years ago I totally messed up with you.
This time I don't want to miss my chance.
Would it be a problem that you've become my type?
Get up.
Judge Morel just called.
She found you a home.
You've got 15 minutes to get ready.
Where is it?
- Pantin.
You will go and see her after and start reimbursing what you stole.
Have you got any money on you?
"If you mean the 200 euros, I spent it all."
- And how are you going to manage?
- It's not a problem.
It's not a problem to find 200 euros?
I've got as much cash as I want.
It just pisses me off to earn it the way I do.
I can't do this without him.
"Look, Dr. Roland, I need to reschedule."
I'll move my nail appointment to next Tuesday.
But I'm not ready to have a baby yet.
"Well, you should have thought of that before you got pregnant."
"Okay, did you somehow swallow my mother?"
"You'll stay with me, right?"
"I can count on you, at least, can't I?"
Absolutely.
"All right, Substitute Daddy, scrub up and get ready because I'm gonna need you to hold the baby as it comes out."
"Now, get a good grip, because it's gonna be kind of slimy."
I'm passing out.
What?
Passing out.
Are you okay?
Gone.
"God, this is going on forever, and I have to get there in time."
What's the longest it's ever taken for a baby to come out?
"Well, I heard about this one woman in the Himalayas who was in labor for a week."
Really?
Yeah.
She died.
"Oh, this is not a helpful story."
"No, it's not."
"God, I can't believe"
I didn't even have it together enough to be there for my own son's birth.
"I mean, my father was a son of a bitch, but he was there when I was born."
"God, Billie must think"
I'm the biggest loser on Earth right now.
You?
What about me?
I'm her sister.
Health teacher sick again?
Not a lot of credibility.
I wonder what kind of creepy substitute we'll get today.
Wow.
That is no substitute.
That is the real thing.
"Good afternoon, class."
"I'm Ms. Kelly, and I'll be filling in for Mr. Dubin for the next few days."
"On behalf of the entire class, I'd like to say... stay as long as you like."
"Now, right now, you seem to be covering..."
"CPR, and I'm today's dummy."
"No, actually, we seem to be up to human reproduction, which I hope we can discuss in a mature fashion."
(laughter)
"Oh, stop being so young."
"You know, I'm not as young as they are."
"I've stayed back, like, 50 times."
- Really?
How old are you?
- 24?
Really?
What are you doing in a seventh-grade classroom?
I'm a cop.
Sit down.
"All right, but I'm watching you."
"All right, who can tell us the name of the organ where the eggs are stored?"
Officer?
"Oh, sorry, Ms. Kelly."
I don't have that stuff.
I can name the stuff I have.
Or at least what I call them.
"All right, the name of the place where the eggs are stored."
What are the gonads?
"This isn't about you, Gary."
"Jesus, nothing here is ever about you."
"I didn't hear any of this 'cause I have a really bad case of tinnitus, especially when discussing morally dubious things."
So it's kind of like sinnitus.
But I'm implicated.
I'm the linchpin.
- I could go to jail!
- Shut up!
"No, you shut up."
You shut up.
And I will also shut up first.
Sue!
"Sue, I need to see the president."
"She's in with the joint chiefs, Gary."
Is it that important?
"Listen, Sue, I'm involved with some stuff here."
Scary stuff like take it to your grave kind of stuff.
And that's the... that's the way I like it.
"Okay, well, she'll be out in five."
Can it wait?
"Yeah, no problem."
No problem.
What if he checks our cover story?
"Like, what if he informs Congress?"
"Dan, he's a congressman."
Congressmen never do anything they say they're gonna do.
How are you not freaking out about this?
I'm kind of having fun.
I like having a cover story.
Makes me feel like a Charlie's Angel.
"God, it was a rush!"
"Yeah, but you're a control freak and this whole thing is out of control, so why aren't you freaking?"
"They're sexting, they're krumping, they're twatting each other 'cause their day's so special they have to share it with the world."
It's called tweeting.
I call it twatting!
"Look, Joey, we were single."
We had our fun.
We're not missing out on anything.
"No, you were single, you had fun."
"I got married early, so I never got to experience this."
I have a feeling you had a chance to experience lots of things.
"But, look, if you want to go play ""Guess Your Disease"""
"or ""Let Me Translate Your Tribal Tattoo,"" knock yourself out."
You don't get it.
I'm here trapped on an island with a woman who can't even stand the sight of me.
And whose fault is that?
It's not my fault!
"Dude, relationships are a two-way street, not a highway and a bike path."
"If it matters to you, work at it."
"And if it doesn't, then don't!"
But make a decision.
I want to be married 'cause I want to have people I can share my life with.
I don't wanna be doing this.
I know what I want.
I want it...
Look.
"Hey, Dave, it's not 'cause I don't want it, okay?"
You make the best of your situation!
My situation's to party!
Yeah!
"Yeah, definitely."
San Diego!
Remember me?
Where have you been?
"Well, you see, the thing is..."
I've got to go to prison.
"-No, seriously."
-I'm being serious.
"God, you think I'd make jokes about a thing like this?"
I'm out of my head with worry.
"Look, we're none of us perfect, okay?"
And I won't bore you with all the financial irregularities.
I knew it was wrong what I was doing.
Just thought I'd get away with it.
My mistake.
"They're coming down so hard now, the regulating bodies, on any kind of fraud."
"Fraud, my God!"
Phillipa.
"So, what are you saying?"
You're being taken to court?
I've been to court.
I've been found guilty.
I go back tomorrow morning for sentencing.
My lawyer reckons twelve months.
Nine if I'm lucky.
"I mean, I'll cope."
I've got to cope.
It's Stephen and Julie.
They've both taken it very badly.
I can imagine.
He'll be like a fish out of water without me around.
And she's just at that age where the hormones are all exploding and she's confused about boys.
"I mean, she desperately needs a woman there... with a wise head on her shoulders."
Who can steer her through the quagmire of sexual relations.
I'll bet.
Oh!
Aren't you just a peach?
There you go.
Where is he?
Tick-tick-tick.
How about we just cut the cop to psychopath chitchat and you tell me what you want?
I want my bombs back.
The one in the bags or the one in the cemetery?
Your friend is dead.
What do you want?
I want to know what happened to me.
A week ago I went to sleep a stone's throw from where we're standing now.
"The next thing I know, it's what, 2012?"
And I wake up lying on the floor of a tomb.
"Tell me how that's possible, and I'll tell you anything you want to know."
Hey.
"Hey, don't walk away from me."
All right.
Stay here and talk to him.
About what?
About what happened.
I don't know what happened.
"You have, like, 50 theories."
Just pick one.
"""Emerson Hauser."""
This was his case.
I think it's a quantum thing.
Imagine a water bug on the surface of a pond.
And he sees this twig sticking out of the water.
"When it rains, the water level rises."
"He thinks the twig is moving, when, in reality, the one dimension he's capable of perceiving is moving."
Not the twig.
"You don't know what happened, do you?"
We like it here.
We have family and community.
And you've just come here with your new novel and turned them against yourself with your arrogance and ego.
You are to blame nobody but yourself for these things.
I don't know how to process that.
I'm not sure how quickly I can absolve you of wrongdoing and shoulder the blame myself.
I'd like to go elsewhere and talk.
Speak with you more.
"Just not standing here, outside."
Okay.
Just not back in there.
Hello.
I've thought it best for my students not to ever see me out of class.
So what do you do at night?
I stay home.
I read and I think.
It will make my life harder if people see me differently.
Does that make sense?
But you want only to be thought of as a talented writer and not as a real person?
"Hmm, yeah."
Yeah.
That's probably about right.
"In fact, that's exactly right."
(SPEAKING IN FRENCH)
Thank you.
All right.
Be a good boy.
"Give me a call, okay?"
Yeah.
I never had a weekend on campus where I went to school.
I can't really quite adjust.
Last night your uncle and then me...
You think someone like me is afraid of being shot?
Back off!
Meredith.
This is between you and I.
"The rest of these guys, they don't matter."
This is just you and me.
And a choice.
You're shaking now.
You're getting angry.
You're letting your emotions get the better of the situation.
The adrenaline is really kicking in.
"But what I know, the reason that I'm not shaking is because this is a choice not dictated by emotion."
This is logic.
"Pure, simple."
My boy over there is rated 4th in the world on the Glock 30.
You know what that means?
What's it mean?
-lt means I could shoot you from Texas.
-(CHUCKLES)
"Now, that's, of course, an exaggeration but the point stands."
He knows what he's doing.
He's a professional.
And you're you.
You've already dropped the gun.
Because this is a choice within a very strict set of parameters.
Right now you're in control.
What you don't wanna do is put him in control.
Don't give him the choice.
That way is death.
That way is the unconditional end to future choice.
That's it.
Good girl.
I believe the number-one source of violence in our world is poverty.
"Now, we were poor in my neighbourhood."
Sometimes we couldn't even eat.
"And my best friend Ricky, he had it worse than us."
One day things got so desperate for Ricky he made a plan to rob the corner store.
And I told my mother about it.
You know what she did?
"She had him over, cooked him a full meal and told him that he could stay with us as long as he wanted."
And it was then that I realised that if you feed a man... you take away his propensity for violence.
"Come on, we're gonna be late."
"Hey, hey, hey-"
"No, no, no."
That's-
"- No, that's not-- That's not--"
This is not happening right now.
"Clyde, we've had this conversation."
My boss does not like squirrels.
It's a bird feeder.
Will you at least look at me when I'm talking to you?
"Look, man, I like squirrels personally, but you're getting me in trouble."
Do you see this?
You know what this is?
Hey.
We gonna need backup?
We're working.
Come on.
- We have any more Robitussin?
"- Yes, sir."
In the car.
"No, I'll get it, it's all right."
Quiet night?
We're under attack by squirrels.
Sam?
So you still think I'm a thief.
A thief?
A thief who stole my heart!
We can go whenever you want. um...
Please stay
"Until the accusation thing,"
We were having such a good time!
"no, I think I should go."
I think I need to date people I haven't robbed.
And still no apology for that.
You two have shamed me in front of the chicago art world.
I bought eight of todd's photos
Out of pure embarrassment.
I hope you like silhouettes of trees.
"I'm sorry, dad."
"A pretty humiliating night for both of us, huh?"
"No, just you."
It's a naked picture of your ex-girlfriend.
"Look, i-i only put it in the show to sell it..."
To make money to--to buy you a present.
"Shut up, todd. you still want her."
-Why can't you just admit it?
-because it's not true.
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, if you love me so much, where's my naked picture?"
"I mean, am I not a fitting enough subject for your art?"
Are these babies not good enough for you?
You brought a mugger to my show?
"Yeah, well, I was, uh, gonna bring a serial killer,"
But his van broke down.
"I mean, you can date whoever you want."
"Yeah, and we've got a cab driver out there preying on young women."
He pinned me up against that wall.
And if it hadn't been for that car horn...
"If we ever find the driver, you can thank him."
Why don't we get the SOCO's down here?
He might have dropped something.
I heard that blood expert from work died.
Is it the same bloke?
Could be.
You said you lost your keys?
Do you think they were in your bag?
"Yeah, definitely."
I was all fingers and thumbs.
"Oh, god, do you think he's got them?"
You might want to stay somewhere else tonight.
Call a friend.
Just until you've had the locks changed.
OK.
I don't really know who though.
I've only been in London a few weeks.
OK.
We'll sort something.
Both girls are employed at the forensic services lab
They both get into minicabs from work.
"If it isn't the same bloke, it's one hell of a coincidence."
There is no evidence that Kelly was sexually attacked.
But Kelly fought back.
"She got him riled, he lost control and killed her?"
It's possible.
"Yes, Casey."
"Yeah, I'll be down in two secs."
OK.
Rose is back.
"Hello, Number 9."
Oh my!
Are you...?
Wow!
- I always figure you're...
- You always figure out as what?
Imaginary.
Or a boy.
Do you know what I've been doing today?
I've been watching you and your partner.
Did you hear somethin'?
That partner of yours is clean out of her mind
And she's gonna put us all in a real bad spot.
We can't let that happen.
I can't let that happen.
I won't let that happen.
Do you even know what grief her little sloth is gonna cost us?
"Well, I'll tell you."
"Two of the idiots that she ventilated, were engaged."
Do you know who'll they're gonna marry?
The Police Chief's stepdaughters.
And you can bet the house once they sort out all these rubbish.
"Boss is gonna be held accountable, next to that, a garden of variety gang war would be a sunday stroll."
- There was a dead guy at the bottom of the steps.
- He saw me!
"Can I ask you a question, Ma'am?"
Do you always work by yourself?
Yes.
Is it lonely?
What's that to you?
Just wondering.
Not that one.
The little one.
"- I guess we got a deal, huh?"
"- What we got here, Sal, is a test."
A deal for half a million dollars?
Maybe.
Maybe?
"Come on, the guy's in a hurry."
He wants the bread.
He wants to go back to France.
This guy's not gonna play games.
"Look, he's one ofthe shrewdest cats I ever come across."
"What am I, a schmuck?"
What's the hurry?
"He could see a couple of shows, visit the top ofthe Empire State Building."
"Don'tjerk me, Weinstock."
I spent a lot oftime setting' this one up.
"So what do you want, a badge?"
"This is your first major-league game, Sal."
"One thing I learned: move calmly, move cautiously, you'll never be sorry."
"Look, I've been damn careful up to now."
This is why your phone lines are tapped and the feds are crawlin' all over you like fleas.
- He'll take the deal somewhere else.
- Let him take it and find out how easy it is... ..to put together a half a million in cash.
There's no hurry to do this kind of business.
The stuff is here!
We can make the switch in an hour!
"Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll split ifwe don't move."
This guy's got 'em like that.
He's everything they say he is.
"What about you, Sal?"
Are you everything they say you are?
"Yes, that's a fine poem."
"So the ""glass"" remained intact?"
"Yes, it remained intact."
He'll be saved.
"- Doctor, do you mind if I smoke?"
"- No, you should mind."
- What?
- You should mind.
Not me. lt's no concern of mine if you smoke.
The air is so pure here.
It'll take more than your cigarette to pollute it.
I only measure my strength with my lungs.
"If you're in good health, carry on."
"Doctor, what's your speciality?"
I don't have one.
"That way, I look after the whole body."
"If I specialised, I'd be limited."
You must have a lot of patients then.
Almost no one.
"I have to ride around, looking at nature's beauty, calling on people, doing the odd circumcision, giving jabs, piercing ears, etc."
"If I'm no use to others, at least I make the most of life."
I observe nature.
Observing nature is better than playing backgammon.
Or doing nothing.
"This is the place, doctor."
ldleness leads to corruption.
"Well, well, it's our invalid!"
She's my friend.
She's as old as Methuselah.
"Hello, are you well?"
It's been a while!
I have things to do.
My 5-year-old niece just texted me this.
"""Uncle Jesse, you're a big fat stinking... ooh!"""
How does she know that word?
And my grandma's weighing in.
Probably just to say that she loves you and that everything's gonna be okay.
Yeow!
Now you know where your little niece got the trucker mouth.
Look Jesse you had to know that dating me.
Was sometimes gonna be a pain in the...
Well I'm not your grandma so I'm just gonna say complicated.
Dating me would be a pain in the complicated.
"But I'm worth it, aren't I?"
"Again this is where you say ""No..."""
What?
What do I say?
And to which one of you?
"Because if I'm dating Hannah, now I'm cheating on Miley."
"And if I'm dating Miley, then I'm the jerk who broke Hannah Montana's heart."
Either way I'm just...
[Cell phone buzzing]
And that's my mom.
"Ooh well if we ever get married, she is not gonna be baby-sitting the triplets."
I have very specific fortune cookies?
Would you stop joking about this?
"Listen, Jesse sometimes joking about it is the only way that I get through it."
You just stepped into this.
This has been my life for six years.
Please let's just forget about it.
Come on.
"Pizza, a movie, anything."
Let's go.
Pizza and a movie is not gonna fix this.
"- I cannot do that, Miss."
Everything must be in order.
Does the letter weigh too much?
You may want to come back to the counter again!
Here's another letter for him.
Maybe they know his address.
"Wait, I'll write it down for you."
"Again, I'm so sorry."
"Don't strain yourself, Karl!"
"If I were to wait for Bruno, I wouldn't get going today."
He's still on his lunch break.
Just once I'd like to see that you did not make any excuses for your brother.
How long will you be gone?
"Well, Anna, I really don't know."
The stuff here must go to Frankfurt and Essen.
And I won't return empty-handed.
That doesn't pay.
"And I'd also like to do some sightseeing in the West, you know."
"Middelmann  Co., starting anew over there."
"What, from Berlin?"
That's out of the question!
"But Anna, it can't go on like this;"
that you're always assisting.
But that doesn't bother me.
It does me!
I want my kid to inherit something of value!
Has he stirred again?
- Are you Mr John?
"- Yes, what is it?"
I just want to enquire about an address.
My husband needs to go.
You wait in the office meanwhile.
- Hi.
- Thank you.
You'll like it.
It's nice.
Good fries.
- How are you?
"- Fine, thanks."
What?
This place all right?
"So, Fiona, how are you?"
"- I mean, how are you feeling?"
- My stomach's fine.
Great.
"I must still be a bit barmy, though."
"This kind of thing doesn't go away overnight, does it?"
No.
"If Mum was going to get Will to marry her, she'd have to quit making jokes like that."
At least she looked good.
I had her put on that nice hairy jumper  and the earrings she got from her friend that went to Zimbabwe.
The kid seemed to think this was some kind of date.
"As for his mum, she was clearly insane  and appeared to be wearing some kind of Yeti costume."
This had better be quick.
We were definitely not ordering starters.
"I'll start with the artichoke, please."
Then I'll have a mushroom omelet with fries and a Coke.
- I'll have the vegetable platter.
- We're vegetarians.
I'd never have guessed.
"Steak sandwich, please, mate."
Thanks.
Don't just sit there.
Talk to each other.
Well you can have me.
I don't wanna have you.
I wanna make love to you.
I'm telling this for your own good...
I think you should go home.
You've spent all your energy trying to get me excited and then...
Want to throw me out?
Please leave...
Come here.
Ok I'd like two orders of shrimp fried rice.
An order of shrimp and pea pods.
An order of shrimp with lobster sauce.
And an order of jumbo shrimp.
Owen...get up.
-What I'm working on.
-That's what I'm working on.
Are you...a researcher?
"No I'm a TV producer, do you think that they exist?"
So you're looking for heroin and you don't want the police to know about it.
"Listen, this really has nothing to do with drug traffic."
What can I do?
Nobody really knows the true nature of these aliens.
You're from Germany?
"Yes, Berlin."
I'm jewish...
So what connections do you think there can possibly be between UFO's and...heroin?
What the fuck is going on in here?
Have you ever seen a UFO ?
"Yes, this morning, that's why I'm here."
Well that's very interesting.
Would you like a drink?
You can see it as well.
"Fine, but just for the record, you cannot be more wrong."
Spies are supposed to be better liers.
Enjoy your walk.
Come by the house this afternoon.
I'll show you around.
I guess I could check it out.
"Normal fellows, right?"
"From the beginning, you were stuck at OC because of your dad."
- Now you're not stuck with those guys.
- They're were not all bad.
A cappucino for Evan.
- How's it going?
- Good...
Just drinking coffee.
We're gonna have a special meeting this week on you coming back.
Just hang it tight.
You guys are losing a great pledge.
I don't think we're losing anybody.
You have a history of letting great people get away from you.
You know what?
I've tried to be nice to you by not kicking your ass.
"Last semester, I've put up with the digs, with the insults out of respect for Casey."
She and I are not together anymore.
You do the maths.
- He's just sticking up versus...
- I can do maths.
I'm good at it.
"I hear a lot of buzzing, but no actual words."
That's what insects do.
"They buzz around, try to sting you."
"Be careful, insect!"
Some insects are quite deadly.
Just tell me what you need.
All right?
I'm easy.
I'm going to keep a happy thought and assume this is just a negotiating tactic.
"All right, listen to me very carefully."
You are going to give Badger Mayhew the best legal representation ever.
But no deals with the DEA!
All right?
Badger will not identify anyone to anybody.
"If he does, you're dead!"
Why don't you just kill Badger?
"Follow me, guys, but if a mosquito's buzzing around you, it bites you on the ass, you don't go gunning for the mosquito's attorney."
You go grab a flyswatter.
"I mean, so to speak."
"I mean, all due respect, do I have to spell this out for you?"
"We're not killing Badger, yo!"
Then you got real problems.
'Cause the DEA is gonna come down on your boy like a proverbial ton of bricks.
I mean.
"I don't think I'm going out on a limb here, but he's not gonna like prison."
He's gonna sing like Céline Dion regardless of what you do to me.
Mr. Mayhew?
I recognize your cough.
Take that mask off.
Get some air.
Go on.
Take it easy!
"Breathe in, breathe out."
"I'm gonna stand up, all right?"
'Cause I got bad knees.
That's better.
Ok.
"Don't mess with the clever, quiet one."
"Why are you so negative about it all, John?"
I enjoyed sharing a cell with you.
I learned a lot.
Why have you got your eyes closed?
"Cos when I open them again I'll be waking up in my nice, cosy cell and you won't be with me."
I'm still here.
"- What do you do for them, Calum?"
- You know...
Pretty much what I've always done.
"Multi-tasking, bits and bobs, needles and pins."
"Not quite how the judge described it at your sentencing, was it?"
What do they want us to do?
Do the stuff the law can't do.
Dealing with people the law can't reach.
"Come on, John, you're the clever one."
Have you not worked it out yet?
Check out the CVs.
Who can make sure the cat is most definitely dead?
Doof!
You're the specialist.
You're the killer.
"# Oh, know how I love you"
# As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
# And the rosebuds... #
"Morning, flatmate."
Did you sleep well?
I made some breakfast.
I'd have made some for you but that was the last of the bacon.
- As they always this noisy upstairs?
- Mm.
I like it.
Now shut your trap.
- You mean you won't go?
- No!
And if you mention gold temples again to me...
I'll tear the back right off you with a shovel.
"Very well, MacChesney, you made your choice."
I offered you the chance to be a millionaire... and you turned it down.
"All right, I'm going alone."
Wait a minute!
"Cutter, you ain't leaving this village without my permission."
Give me that bottle.
I've been a soldier for 14 years.
I know my duties as well as you do.
"But you're not talking to a soldier now, you're talking to an expedition."
I'm an expedition.
Out of my way.
"Cutter, sit down before I throw you down."
"Make way for the expedition, if you know what's good for you."
Goodbye forever.
Stand back.
I'll throw you in the clink if you make a move.
Out of my way before I split your jaw.
"- Cutter, I'm warning you."
"- Come on, put 'em up."
"Come on, out of my way."
"I'll bash your ugly face in, that's what I'll do."
"Come on, put 'em up."
I'm afraid I have to do it.
Sgt. Ballantine.
- What?
- Come here.
Poor fellow's taken with a dizzy spell.
- I'm clean.
You?
- I'm clean.
I had my tubes tied.
- Fuck the condoms.
- Great.
"This isn't all some scheme to get back control of Isabelle's money, is it?"
"This isn't some hostile way for you to get back at Dean, is it?"
- I'm not sure what it is.
"- Me, neither."
- I'm not sure I care right now.
"- Me, either."
My cousin live in a village where all the babies born one year look like those Oompa Loompas.
"Then they stop the crop-dusting, and the next year, all fine."
Do they dance and sing morality songs?
"No, but a lot of them are tossed in bars to make a living."
I used to have nightmares about the boat scene.
I remember that.
I used to have to crawl in bed with you and read to you from the real-estate section to get you to fall asleep.
Which got me into trouble at school.
"When we were starting Roosevelt,"
"I proudly announced to the entire class that FDR stood for ""Formal Dining Room."""
I like this part!
"Oh, can we say chicken parmesan?"
No.
"Oh, no."
I promise I won't yell.
No ultimatums.
- I just want to talk.
Can I come in?
- Bad timing.
What's going on?
I'm stuck on something.
I could use an extra set of eyes.
And I'll let you insert your own blind joke.
"I'd love to, but I'm on my way out."
I just came to check a few emails.
I like it.
Banker's hours.
Make that banker's half day.
"Hey, you want to grab a beer later?"
"I'll try not to smash a bottle over anyone's head, but I can't make any promises."
"As nice as that sounds, I'm on my way out of town."
Did Joan put you on an assignment I don't know about?
I'm taking a few days vacation.
Really?
"This from the woman who's never taken a day off work for Thanksgiving, Christmas, or Kwanzaa."
It was a spontaneous thing.
"Now, that is more like the Annie Walker that I know."
Where you going?
"Michael's taking my sister away, and they need me to watch the girls."
What about Michael's parents?
Didn't they just move out there?
They're on a cruise.
And they just now asked you to come out?
They're not big planners.
"Listen, I'm gonna be late for my flight."
"I'm fine, Auggie."
We'll catch up when I get back.
I've never pulled a job like this in three hours.
I included a rush fee.
This is fully biometric?
I used a blank R.F.I.D. chip from the actual Thai facility the GPO uses.
- And she can travel anywhere?
"She went back inside caressing his hair, and..."
It's the Iast time I saw her alive.
You stayed with the others?
"No, I was tired, I had to work early the next morning."
"I let them deal with it, I jumped into my truck and I went straight home."
"You're here now, so you came back later."
- Is that it?
- One hour later.
"Yeah, one hour later."
"I don't know why, but I couldn't sleep."
I drank some water and looked out the window.
"Lights were on at C,duIie's, so I went over right away."
"Just as I got there, I think I heard a gun shot."
Then the lights went out.
"So I slowed down, down, then... a second shot, and the lights came on."
"I stepped on it, then I saw the kid with the gun."
"I just had time to lean over, then another shot."
"There was a hole where my face was before, the black guy was gone."
I got out of my truck and ran across the lawn.
"There's Touchy, Ducky with Josée, and C,duIie, covered in blood."
What happened?
", I asked."
Touchy couldn't answer.
"C,duIie wasn't moving."
Ducky was speechless.
"Josée, was crying."
Touchy was trying to bring her to...
I felt something in my back.
"I turned, saw polo."
He had blood in his mouth.
"We tried to bring her to, but she was gone, gone for good."
polo walked towards where the black kid was.
You're so naive.
"Decontamination work only pays 10,000 yen per day, 20 days per month."
The fish cake factory pays 750 yen per hour.
"You know, even deciding to buy clothes used to be a dilemma, pacing back and forth, not sure if I should."
"Now, if it's under 20,000 yen, I just buy it."
Being poor is unthinkable now.
"Talking with the cast and crew is fun, and I get to meet cool people."
"When I get makeup done and wear costumes,"
I start to become someone else and forget the bad stuff.
"Porn is legitimate work, so I don't feel guilty at all."
"Can you tell Mom and Dad you're doing porn, then?"
No.
You shouldn't do work you can't tell your parents about.
What about you?
Why are you here?
Weren't you at Grand Pacific?
I was fired.
Why?
None of your business.
This is a love hotel.
Can you tell Mom and Dad?
What if I do?
Go ahead.
"Sorry, excuse me."
"Azusa, we're ready for you now."
- Okay.
- Thank you.
"Don't tell Mom and Dad, okay?"
It'll make them sad.
It makes...
Will you take a picture with us?
"Sure, of course."
Not your kid?
He's nearly as white as you are.
That don't prove nothing.
You're calling me a whore?
Dale...
"I was a virgin when we met, and you know it."
(BIRD SINGING)
Hear the whippoorwill?
Remember what you told me about when you hear a whippoorwill?
It means somebody's going to die.
How come we got to sit here in the dark like this?
Because I don't want to be a sitting duck if they show up out there.
I told you they won't be here until they call.
Where you going?
To get my cigarettes.
They're in my purse.
You can have one of mine.
"I smoke menthol, baby."
You know that.
I'll get them.
"I forgot that thing was even in there, baby."
Ray gave me that for protection.
I don't even know how it works.
You pull the damn trigger.
"Dale, what are you looking at me like this for?"
"What, did you think I was going to shoot you or something?"
That's crazy.
"Now can I have my cigarettes, please?"
"Can I have a light, baby?"
(WHIPPOORWILL SINGS)
So...
Does that wife of yours treat you right?
How did you get to do this?
Writing I mean.
Parfitt.
He's making comedies for Baker.
Used to click gangs of heard into me sung in the pub.
Many a time.
He'll think you were born into purpose.
Certainly spent enough time in 'em as a kid.
He was a soldier.
In and in the last one.
"The thing about men who get sent away to war, Mrs.Cole, is that some of them don't come back at all... some come back as heroes... and some of them come back drunk squalid bullies."
I was better off it this way.
In the pub?
Or the pictures.
I liked the pictures best.
Once in a while you just need to make one that's worth it.
Worth...the hour and a half of someones life that's gonna see it.
Ah!
I really thought this one would be.
Bloody Yanks.
Hm.
Would be alright if all we had to do is look at him.
We strip him down to the essentials and use a voice-over.
"I wasn't there at the beginning of the story, but it all began in a little fishing village in Englo..."
Yes.
Yes.
"Inarticulacy, authenticity."
He's too cut out.
Nah!
No.
He really can't.
But Hilliard can.
- I didn't know the map was a swindle.
- You and your emeralds.
You ought to be put in a padded cell.
"If we'd found them emeralds, we could've left the army... and lived like dukes."
See?
That's the fellow that sold me the map.
Just a minute.
"Let me take care of him, will you?"
Take your hands off that man.
I'm waiting for an explanation.
"Speak up, MacChesney."
Speak up!
"We were swindled, sir."
- We?
- Who swindled you?
We don't want to make any charges until we have further proof.
Further proof?
You practically wrecked a village.
"You surely didn't do that, MacChesney, without proof?"
"Sir, we had our suspicions."
Suspicions of what?
Come on.
I've no time to wheedle the story out of you.
We bought a map.
Go on.
"From a private in a certain Scottish regiment, sir."
"No, I did it."
"I bought the map myself, sir."
"Now, listen."
"Don't you try to shield your friends, Cutter."
And it won't do you two any good to hide behind Cutter's generosity.
Out with it.
I think we all need to take a moment.
Mr. Campbell-- looks like I found one dumb enough not to.
"- Mr. Campbell, I think if you sit down again..."
- No!
I think that we could all...
"What the hell are you doing, man?"
- He doesn't have a case.
"- Maybe, maybe not but he's the client."
"Yeah, well, he was pushing my buttons."
I don't care if he punched you in the face.
"Look, we're both trying to make partner here, Adam."
All right?
"I haven't said anything to you before this because... it was none of my business, but now you're making it my business because it's affecting me."
"- So what's your point, Jimmy?"
- We both know this is about you and Brian.
"Now you don't want to talk to me, that's fine."
"But, uh, talk to somebody before you ruin both of our careers."
Just a minute.
I'm coming!
- It's me.
Thank god you're here.
I have no idea what to wear and...
Hi.
Did you read my mind?
No.
These are just the maternity clothes that you lent me.
"Well, I don't need them back."
I'm not gonna have a baby anytime.
Ever.
I-I don't need them.
I--I'm going for a more...
- Classic look.
You keep talking to me for no reason.
Did you lose it?
You can't retrieve it?
Moon Kwon.
Yes?
"When I completed the manuscript for the autobiography yesterday, didn't I send it?"
"You must have, you said you were."
"You sent that, made some fried eggs and we had one each."
They didn't get it?
It disappeared?
"Fine, all right."
Emails are now not only arriving late but disappearing?
No way.
I didn't send it.
There's no record.
"Noona, what's wrong with you?"
Why do you keep forgetting things?
"Stop taking the painkillers, I think that's the problem."
"I sent it, please check."
Change my phone number.
"You said you could do it through the homepage, right?"
"Yes, but why?"
When I tell you to do something just do it.
Do you have to know everything?
You do that too.
"All right, all right."
"I'll shut my mouth and complete my task,"
I have no complaints!
"Change your clothes and wash up, I'm hungry."
Let's eat some curry.
What did you say?
"I made some curry and rice, didn't you hear?"
"- No, no."
- She gets defensive.
"- No, I don't get defensive."
- I'm not defensive.
I'm not!
- She gets defensive.
Ladies.
"I am gonna meet with you before every date, and we're gonna check your clothes, your makeup."
To make sure you're projecting the right image.
Based on the bachelors.
We'll go over mutual areas of interest.
"Now, I have been going over your questionnaire and it seems like your priorities are..."
Huh...
"Well, looks."
"Oh, no."
"That doesn't sound like you, Kitty."
"No, it's me."
It's me.
It's me.
"Well, sweetheart, looks fade."
"You want someone intelligent, who'll make you laugh."
"And cultured, so you can travel with him."
- Go to the theater.
- Since when do I go to the theater?
"You know, Miss Walker, I just signed a client who sounds exactly like the man you're describing."
"He's charming, funny."
I think he's about your age.
"Never married, so he's not bitter."
And he's an accomplished ballroom dancer.
I think he would love to meet you.
Know what?
You'd be doing me a huge favor.
Tie it to Steve's leg.
"Now, I want everybody out of here."
We'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.
I'll get the men from the barracks.
You think you can snatch Dunbar?
Not from the S.S.
We're sure gonna make a stab at it.
"Duke, Price, Stosh, Harry, meet at the north latrine."
You'll all get your posts.
"Now, everybody start drifting out, one by one."
"Easy, boys, easy."
Disperse out there nicely.
"Remember, just because the Krauts are dumb that doesn't mean they're stupid."
- Ready?
-Roger.
"Okay, move out."
I don't know what your scheme is.
it sounds crazy.
"It may be, but it's better than having Dunbar dead."
I guess you're right.
How about me going out and keeping Schulz off balance?
- Good.
- I wouldn't worry about Schulz.
I'd worry about Sefton.
Remember me?
I'm the stoolie.
"You ain't gonna squeal this one, brother."
No?
Aren't you afraid to turn the stoolie loose on that compound?
"For a tip-off like this, you know what the Krauts would pay?"
"You're gonna stay here in the barracks, and not a peep out of you."
"Okay then, put a guard on me."
"It's me, José."
- They've asked for reinforcements.
- Smithy.
"- OK, I'll deal with it."
- Show me what we have to do next.
Can you see those iron girders down there?
The inspection tunnel is on the same level.
That's the most vulnerable part of the dam.
The water pressure will destroy the rest.
- It takes a long time to build one of those.
- I don't care.
Do you care that many innocent people are going to die down there?
Why did he say that?
He'd do anything to reach his goal too.
- He's like a leopard.
"- Yes, intrepid and merciless."
I wouldn't like to be his enemy.
"Hey, Jaime!"
"The explosive has to be attached to the end of the girders, understood?"
Make sure nobody surprises us.
I'll stay here.
Everybody take cover!
"Hurry, Jaime!"
There's at least ten of them.
They're in control of the dam.
Wake up!
I can't shoot without hitting our own men.
Some of you must go to the other side!
- The convoy mustn't go onto the dam.
- Too late.
"Hey, look!"
Over there!
"So, from now on, I will try to trust you, wherever you go and whatever you do."
So...
"Soo Bin, I would like it if you trusted me too."
I won't run away again.
So... from now on...
Believe in me.
Please.
Han Gyul.
The guy you beat up last time...
- The one I fought...
- The one you fought...
Choi Chan Gyu...
He wants to fight you one more time.
"The reason you keep failing your exam... is because you spend all your time working part-time jobs, isn't it?"
There's nothing I can do about that.
Don't you regret giving up that special position at the agency?
I don't regret it.
"If I took that, that would mean I would never see you or Shi Yoon again."
"Especially you, Jung Yeon."
You're even supplying the entertainment.
You seem to be having a blast.
You said you wanted to fight.
Are you on a date instead?
Jung Yeon.
"It's dangerous, go over there."
"Hey, speak with some respect."
Isn't it obvious that I'm older than you?
I'm taller too.
I'll keep these guys out of it.
"We'll fight, one on one."
- Since you asked for it.
- What if I win?
I was afraid of people walking in the streets.
"The more movement I saw around me, the more I wanted to be still."
I'm sure things weren't as bad as I remember them now.
Are you coming to the rehearsal?
-Well...
One of the songs is going to amaze you.
Then I'll go for sure.
Even now I can't understand everything that happened back then.
I felt such panic I wanted to go back to the madhouse.
Stop thinking about it.
The funniest thing was when Laura left that guy...
She almost reproached me for my apathy.
Are you writing in your diary?
How do you know I have a diary?
You told me.
I'm sure I didn't tell you anything.
But are you writing it?
Yes.
And what is it about?
About what happens to me.
Some stuff.
You're not very talkative today.
I'm upset.
With me?
With mom.
Don't tell her about the diary.
I won't.
You always end up telling her everything.
- I won't say a word.
She'd start asking... and as I won't say anything she'd look for it everywhere.
Did you hide it?
Don't think I'm gonna tell you where it is.
"Before the sun sets on the third day, you've got to get dear old princie to fall in love with you."
"That is, he's got to kiss you."
"Not just any kiss, the kiss of true love."
"If he does kiss you before the sun sets on the third day, you'll remain human permanently."
"But if he doesn't, you'll turn back into a mermaid... and... you belong to me!"
"No, Ariel!"
[muffled]
Have we got a deal?
"If I become human,"
I'll never be with my father or sisters again.
That's right!
But you'll have your man.
"[Chuckles] Life's full of tough choices, isn't it?"
[Cackles]
Oh!
And there is one more thing.
We haven't discussed the subject of payment.
You can't get something for nothing.
- But I don't have any...
- I'm not asking much.
"Just a token really, a trifle."
You'll never even miss it.
What I want from you is... your voice.
- My voice?
"- You've got it, sweetcakes."
"No more talking, singing."
Zip!
"But without my voice, how can I..."
"You'll have your looks, your pretty face."
And don't underestimate the importance of body language!
Ha!
♪ The men up there don't like a lot of blabber
- Don't waste any time.
- Goodbye.
"Who was it, Ben?"
"It was the, uh... the, uh... concierge at the hotel."
He found out we were being held by the police.
He just called to see if there was anything he could do.
- That's very nice of him.
"- Yes, I thought so."
"I told him if we weren't back there in 15 minutes, for him to call the American Consulate at Casablanca."
"But, monsieur, if you had only told me in the first place that you wished to consult with your consul."
"Yeah, yeah."
"Come on, Jo."
There is just one small formality.
I must request you to sign a statement.
"If it doesn't take too long, of course."
Wait a moment. I will send for a typist.
(Hoofbeats)
Ben?
Yeah?
Aren't you going to let me see the message?
I don't - l... I don't think I should.
"Darling, I'm not the police inspector."
I think that I should see it.
"Ben, why didn't you give this to the police?"
- Because I didn't want to.
"- But, Ben, a man's life - ls at stake, yeah l know."
I just - l-l don't know what's the right thing to do.
"We should go back to the hotel, pick up Hank and get out of here."
- Maybe.
- Think about Hank.
"What a terrible thing this is for him, seeing a man murdered right before his eyes."
- It's a horrible shock to a little boy.
"When they found you, what the hell did they do?"
My mom shook me like a Polaroid picture.
That's what the hell she did.
"She be like, ""Don't you ever run away from me again."""
I will kill you!
"As long as you stay Black--"""
"I'm like, ""When am I gonna change?"
"What-- What am I--""."
"""As long as you stay Black, don't you ever run away from me again."""
"And then I'd cry so hard,"
I could only get one letter out.
"I be, ""Uh--Uh--Uh--""."
"Eeeeh!"""
You ever seen a little kid get disciplined?
"He be crying, he be, ""Eeeh!"""
"And it's sprinkler cry, ""Tsh-tsh-tsh--eeeeh!"""
"I'm saying, you ain't gotta whip 'em."
You change your personality.
Go Bernie Mac on 'em one damn time and see how they feel.
Just let 'em talk back to you.
"""Shut up, Mom!"""
"""What the fuck did you just say?"
"""And let me tell you something."
"You better sit there and shut what they call the fuck up."""
"""And I'm gonna tell you something."
"""You come over here again, gonna be trouble, trouble."
"""Bust a move!"
Bust a motherfucking move!
"Son of a bitch!"""
"Y'all know the man's eyes was crossed, come on now."
"It's about an authoritative tone, man."
I'm tired of going to the malls and seeing situations with a little kid just running amok.
Someone in there might be trying to get out.
Thas a big assumption.
"Even if our people didn't cause the problem, you know they'd take advantage of it."
This is our best chance to find them.
"In about 30 seconds, the Mokra are going to open fire."
I don't know how long we'll be able to wait for you.
Understood.
Darod.
I'm looking for my people.
Back this way.
I'll show you.
Don't move.
There you are.
What are you doing here?
I would do everything in my power to protect my only child.
There's a phased- ion charge coming at us from the planet.
Full power to the shields.
Shields at 60 percent.
Minor damage on Deck 14.
They're firing again.
Modulate the shield frequencies.
Try to throw off their sensors.
No effect.
Direct hit to the port nacelle.
Redirect all warp power to the shields.
Two more coming in.
Captain.
We've got to get you back to the ship.
You're hurt.
"Ralkana, the other cells are this way."
We must find your mother.
Follow this passageway until it dead- ends.
The only thing shot was a bottle of soda.
I don't even know if you should go there alone anymore.
Maybe we should drop you off every morning.
Dad !
The gun was in the school.
We can't be with her all day.
We are not going to change our entire lives over this.
There was one stupid gun shot.
You are not dropping me at school.
God. I'm not an eight years old.
At my school this kid slipped on this wet spot.
And fell.
Like on his face.
Maybe we should take her out of school.
- Honey.
- Put her in private school.
- l wish we could afford that.
- Maybe that's not an excuse.
Maybe we should sacrifice other things.
Like the house in Palm Beach?
This is our daughter we are talking about.
I know.
"Listen, I don't know why the world's gone so crazy..."
and I don't know what to do about it.
I wish we could keep them...
in some kind of bubble to protect them but I know we can't.
I'm not asking for a bubble.
"How about just a place where they can live, and walk to school..."
and become grownups without having to worry about...
guns and Al D S and serial murderers.
That didn't use to be exotic.
That wasn't the province of the rich.
"I'll keep my eyes closed, I promise."
"He's such a good man, isn't he?"
'I wanted to get Lena's things quickly and get back to the house.
"'I don't know what it was - a feeling, I guess - 'but I was bothered by something."
'Maybe I just didn't trust Higgins with her.
"'Anyway, I'd feel better the sooner I got back to the estate."
"'What I really didn't like was invading the privacy of their home, 'especially since I knew what they'd experienced in the past."
"'I felt strange going through Lena's things, which was silly."
'I'd seen this kind of stuff before.
"'Well, most of it, anyhow."
"'If I couldn't take Saul back to her, 'l could at least take back a pleasant memory.'"
We don't know what we're up against.
This was taken in Suez with my messmates.
"That was in 1946, right after the war."
Karl.
It's dark.
She must be in the main house.
With how many others?
I only have four shots.
Don't worry.
That'll be enough.
"The pictures are wonderful, Higgins."
But I have such a headache.
Do you mind?
"Oh, how inconsiderate of me."
You must be exhausted.
Can I get you anything?
An aspirin?
Some chicken soup?
You're so kind.
Thank you.
Just a little rest.
And I'm still waiting on the reply.
Maybe I should pedal.
You look a little tired.
Fine.
Go !
"Frank, hi, it's Julie."
I hope you're okay.
"Caitlin and I are fine, I mean, we're trapped at the ice cream store on the pier, but we're fine."
I guess help is probably on the way.
"Okay, well... take care, bye."
"Look, I understand why you keep on calling Summer and the Cohens, but why Frank ?"
"I mean, weren't you guys supposed to take it down a notch ?"
"Caitlin, just because we're pulling things back a little bit doesn't mean that we've stopped caring about each other."
"I'm sure wherever Frank is, he's worried about us, just like I am about him."
"And I am about myself, because we're stuck here with him."
"The back door is stuck, too."
Looks like there's no way out.
We're trapped.
Figures.
We can't just sit here waiting to be rescued.
Totally.
"No, we should start eating all the melting ice cream."
I want a gold medal ribbon on a...
"Sugar cone, I know."
"Creepy, but convenient."
"Okay, ice-cream guy, start scooping."
"It's Gary, my name."
Okay.
"I'm thinking the roof, or where the roof used to be."
"Ice-cream guy, got a ladder ?"
You can't climb up there.
"I'm not going to, you are."
Completely destroyed!
This concert was to be the pinnacle of my distinguished career.
"Now, thanks to you, I am the laughingstock of the entire kingdom!"
But it wasn't her fault...
"Uh, well, first, uh, the shark chased us."
"Yeah, yeah."
And we tried to...
"but we couldn't, and he... [growls] And..."
And we...
Whoa!
[Sighs] And then we were safe.
"But then this seagull came, and it was, ""This is this..."""
Seagull?
- [Gasps]
- What?
Oh!
"You went up to the surface again, didn't you?"
- Didn't you?
- Nothing happened.
"Oh, Ariel, how many times must we go through this?"
"You could have been seen by one of those barbarians, by one of those humans!"
- They're not barbarians.
- They are dangerous.
Do you think I want to see my youngest daughter snared by a fish-eater's hook?
I'm 16 years old.
I'm not a child anymore.
"Don't you take that tone of voice with me, young lady!"
"As long as you live under my ocean, you'll obey my rules!"
- If you would just listen...
- Not another word!
And I am never... never to hear of you going to the surface again!
Is that clear?
What's garbage like you doing with garbage like this?
"Come on, open her up."
"It's the only job I can get, seeing as how people are so damn discriminant... against those who have paid their dues."
Discriminant?
"Hell of a word there, Clive."
But it ain't your word.
"What did you do with the other truck, huh?"
You're gonna start walking...
Hey.
"What you got there, boy?"
You spit that out.
Spit it out!
You spit that out!
Huh?
"Come on, get up."
Get up!
What?
Is it the stew-maker?
"Hear the cartel has a guy, dissolves people in acid, puts them in a barrel, makes them soup."
Is that who I'm waiting for?
Is it you?
My job is to place a call at 7:30.
And if you don't make the call?
You get put on a list.
And if you get put on the list... it's unfortunate.
"But if Clive isn't here in the next 15 minutes... soon enough, I'll be talking to a dead man."
Well...
If I'm already dead...
You're a dead man!
You ain't doing too good a job at staying gone.
"You know, sometimes..."
I can't get through an entire day without hearing all kinds of rumors getting told about you.
"Now look, you listen to me."
I did not kill my wife.
"You want to know who took Sara Collins, don't waste your time talking to me."
Talk to the senator.
Why would I do that?
Because he knows who did.
You think you know what's going on.
You haven't even sucked one drop off the tip of that iceberg.
"Listen, your wife was alive for two months before they killed her."
"Now, either they wanted something from her... or they wanted something from you."
Best way to get to a man is through the woman he loves.
That's how they control you.
Who?
Do you know how she was killed?
We believe she was drowned.
Where?
"Oh, my God...!"
This is all my fault.
It won't end.
You give Jeff Collins a message from me.
He can fry in hell.
No!
It was a damn witness interview.
I did not see that coming.
"Graham, there was nothing you could've done."
I pushed him there.
You don't push someone to take their own life after a two-minute interview.
"If you keep beating yourself up, you're no good to this case and you know it."
All due respect.
Did you get a sense of what might have set them off.
Guilt.
Guilt?
And you're going to write down the stats that go on the window tomorrow.
Marcus is gonna come by and pick up the photo for safekeeping.
Wait-Wait a second.
I am not going to repeat myself!
"The three of you are going to sit right there, just like that on the couch so I know you're behaving."
And you tell no one about this.
"We wouldn't want anyone messing with our little golden goose here, huh?"
"Now, would we?"
I want 50%.
(CHUCKLES)
You take a zero off that number.
That still makes you a very lucky man.
"Yeah, I feel real lucky."
We didn't agree to this.
"(SIGHS) You should have talked to us, man."
"I did my best, okay?"
Don't sit on the car.
"Listen, this isn't the city."
They're a different breed of snob up here.
It's academia.
Academia nuts.
(LAUGHS)
I fail to understand the distinction.
"Yeah, I do, too, sometimes."
It's been really awful.
I consider you my good friend.
I appreciate that.
But you'll soon find how little that counts for.
I'm not referring to myself.
But there's a lot of assholes out there.
"Less up here than in the city, but it's all relative."
You say it yourself.
"You know, that's not gonna get your son back."
Quinn?
Is that his name?
It's not gonna get him back.
"And if you keep that up, you're gonna have two problems instead of one."
You know what he told me?
"He told me, ""I want my mama back."""
I want...
I want my son back.
"Well, um, Child Services won't let you live with Quinn again until you get treatment."
"And to get treatment, I need to prove PTSD."
- Post-traumatic stress...
- This is not combat-related.
"Hell, I got both my arms."
I didn't get my legs blown off.
I'm not in no damn wheelchair.
I know.
PTSD from military sexual trauma is just as real.
"Yeah, I know."
And it makes the military look bad.
What makes the military look bad is your senior officer raping you over and over again.
I don't want people looking at me like I'm crazy.
- Do you understand that?
- Yeah.
I think I have some insight into that.
So you think you've seen what I've seen?
"No, but I've seen some pretty bad stuff."
I have seen thousands of spiders running up my best friend's face.
You wacked.
Yeah.
It's called schizophrenia.
So they sent me somebody crazier than I am.
That's true.
Mike and I got a lot of:
"""So, the music's really a character."""
"Yeah, the music's a fifth character."
New York's a character.
Yugo's a character.
Gum is a character.
"Yeah, the gum is a character."
"The Yugo's a character, you know."
"I'm not gonna lie, I felt important while this was happening."
"I was going in front of the line, doing what I want."
So we're going into one of my favorite scenes in the film.
"Mike and Kat, you did an amazing job with this dancing."
And I was worried about how we were gonna do this.
"Yeah, this was one of the most tired days of the shoot."
- Remember?
- This was when we switched to days.
- This was our first day.
- That's right.
We had been on the night schedule so we had not enough sleep.
I love your dance because it's so you two.
And only the two of you would do that.
"And only, I think, after hours of..."
"I mean, not being able to sleep for days."
You can tell we were desperate for sleep.
"Yeah, I don't know what I'm talking about."
What am I saying?
I have a stomach ache from fatigue at this point.
"But when this was written, it was like ""Norah and Nick get up on Beefy Guy and Dev's shoulders and do a dance."""
- It was so terrifying.
- I didn't trust Rafi to hold me at all.
I didn't trust anyone to hold me.
Funny.
"Right here, at the Del Rio, $50 is a cheap evening."
"And over here, it's a lot of laundry."
I never get used to New York.
"I don't know why not, it got used to you."
"Darling, since you're the one who did the walking out, why should you be so unfriendly?"
-I don't like revivals.
-And what makes you think this is one?
"We knew each other very well, for a very long time."
"I've been away, and now I'm back."
"Is it so odd that I should want to know how you are, and what you're doing?"
-And that's all?
-And that's all.
Fine.
"I've been working hard, doing nicely, and I'm happy in my marriage."
-She forgave you?
-She forgave me.
And you've been on the wagon since I left.
"If you mean have I been faithful to my wife, yes, I have."
And I don't find it very difficult.
I've always loved my wife.
That shouldn't be news to you.
"Of course, you met me after you were married."
"But then, maybe that wasn't love."
"Whatever it was, it's over."
Maybe it wasn't love.
"Maybe it was only chemistry, or the right combination, or a miracle."
But most people drag through their whole lives without finding it.
"We both know that, don't we, Bran?"
You'd better get back to your Mr. Dawning.
Alec Dawning has other things to offer.
"All that nice, new, shiny money, huh?"
"Isn't that right, Mr. Rafet?"
Sure.
The one who gives less...
We'll talk about that later.
I will prepare your house for you with pictures that just left.
"Excuse me, I'll be back soon."
"Bro, I have some good news for you and some bad news."
The bad news is that Rafet's here.
Good news is that Professor Candan's on his lap
What lap?
Don't exaggerate guys.
"Of course, we might say that it's bad news for you."
What's she doing on his lap?
Mr. Rafet was giving her something but we came in at that moment.
I thought I'd ask you about what to do with these lovebirds.
There's nothing going on.
Decision made.
She's dead for me now.
She's got no taste at all.
He's very depressed.
He's very angry...
And his grandfather is from the tribe...
What happened?
What do you want?
Tell me.
All you have to do is give me the answer keys of all the remaining test exams.
"That's one... if this matter leaves this room, I'll make sure the record you... die for goes public."
And that's two.
Have some water.
"Come on, son."
"If anything goes wrong, I know you and you know me."
- Don't get anyone else involved.
"- Das, you know me well right?"
"- Yes, I do."
But they say the house is too big.
Can I make it smaller?
"If it is too big, check whether they could share it.Let them share the rent."
- OK
- What happened?
"- The big mouth won't reduce the rent, it seems."
"Since the girl too feels the house is too big, you both could share the rent."
Is she OK with it?
Paramasivam is checking that.
"If it is OK with her, would you agree?"
"- I agree, but she musn't not be lawyer."
"- She won't be lawyer, don't worry man."
"If he agrees, I don't mind."
"- Hey, Paramasivam, my client has agreed."
- Madam has agreed too.
- Then give 1 lakh as advance.
Why does he give expression as if it is a register marriage?
Would he ask for a garland too?
- I'll take that room.
"- OK, I'll take the other one."
"- Hey Paramasivam, are you riding the pillion?"
- yes.
- The hot seat might blister your piles.
"- As if he is my doctor, go to hell."
-You would be watching her all the time from tomorrow onwards.
Start the bike
"- Her dress is lovely, isn't it?"
- Shall I borrow it for you to wear?
"- If both of us are in the same profession, it would be a hassle."
Let's avoid that.
(laughs)
"Hey, let me tell you, your wife Alice really outdid herself with this stuff."
This is just delicious.
Here.
"Try this, Ralph."
"- Hey, that's great."
-How about that?
Got a real different taste to it.
(mumbles) You're a lucky guy.
Anything Trixie ever fixes for me is right out of the can.
"Now, if this could come out of the can, that would be different."
This is terrific.
- Norton.
-What?
You just gave me a million-dollar idea.
All I have to do is put this stuff in cans.
"Ralph, you're sitting on a gold mine!"
You could make a million dollars!
I don't care if I make a million dollars.
This is the thing I've always wanted to do for Alice.
Why should she cook just for me?
And just have me enjoy it?
I could put it in cans and the whole world can enjoy her cooking.
I'm gonna make her rich and famous.
I'll run the whole business for her.
All she'll have to do is sit back and collect.
"Boy, oh, boy, that is a worthy sentiment."
I mean it.
"Now, all you got to do is get ahold of Alice and get the recipe."
Then we're off.
"Now, that's the last thing I have to do."
All I have to do is tell Alice that I got a scheme to make money and she'll say it's a crazy scheme.
"Whoa, slow down."
"Ok, maybe not that part, as long as we're a couple and I'm her father, I guess, because I love her... and you too, obviously."
"This is unfair, Michael."
"Your life is so hard right now,"
- and I swear I can help with that.
- I can handle things.
- I've been handling things.
"- I know, I know, I know, but I can help with Sophie or cooking or whatever."
I don't want you to have to take care of me anymore.
I wanna help take care of you.
"And if I don't,"
- you can kick me out.
"- Ok, stop it."
"I do not need a father for Sophie and I do not want to get married, oh my God!"
"Ok, that's a bad choice of words and I'm sorry."
"But... child care, yeah."
"And cooking, maybe."
And then...
Maybe we could see what happens.
One step at a time.
Thank you.
You start early.
I'm a professional.
"What I mean by that is I start work early, but I also go home at 5 pm."
I dreamt I fired you last night.
I have that dream quite often.
You'd know that if you transcribed my dictation.
"In these dreams, would I be a projection of some aspect of your personality?"
"Your professionalism, maybe?"
Is that what you were firing?
"I'm not a doctor, but..."
Sometimes dreams are just wish fulfillment.
"Okay, I'm ""fight"" too."
I hit you on the way out.
Do you really not see the problem here?
"Okay, I don't know what it is, okay?"
This is all I know.
It's like I was raised by wolves.
"No, you weren't."
Wolves stay in a pack.
You know what?
"Look, I guess it's fine, it's just, when it comes to emergency situations,"
I'm on my own.
"Come on, that is not true, all right?"
We are a team.
We're like Sonny and Cher.
"Cher left Sonny, and then Sonny died."
"On a Mountain, in an emergency."
"I think Jack Daniels is a racist, because he does not get along with Jose Cuervo."
"Oh, come on, it's 11:00, we've got to move or we're going to be late for our emotional cooking class."
"Okay, Lil, you know what, we've been on a three day bender."
"Going out and drinking all night, and doing stuff off daily candy all day."
"I mean, I never thought I'd say this, but..."
I actually miss being alone with my thoughts.
I don't.
We're having so much fun.
"Okay, Lil, I'm tired, all right?"
"I'm sorry, but I can't do this anymore."
I think I'm too old to be an alcoholic.
"And I am definitely too old to be grinding teenagers in ""da club."""
"Oh, well, that's okay."
"I mean, there's plenty we can do without drinking."
Can I just say three words to you?
Architectural boat tour.
It's irresponsible.
"I, it's not definite I have the same thing."
I think you know it's the same.
You told the doctor you recognized it.
That's what the next three years of your marriage look like.
"You'll have to feed her, bathe her, and attend to her most personal hygiene."
"My god, what have I got myself into?"
"Philip, calm down."
Calm down?
Have you read this?
She'll have spasms every day.
Then there's the infections and the bed sores...
"Oh, stop, stop!"
I can't handle it!
"Philip, there are nurses, hospices..."
Hospices won't take her until the very end.
"Until then, she'll be your 24/7 responsibility."
All the sounds and smells of her disintegration.
"God, this insentient, incontinent lump of flesh."
I can't be around it!
I can't!
"What a prince, huh?"
He'll get over it.
He'll take care of me.
In sickness and in health.
I have the room picked out.
It's a very beautiful room.
He already thinks that you blackmailed him into marriage.
- That's not true.
- He's gonna let you die alone.
His own wife?
It'd get out.
"I've shown that, haven't I?"
I don't believe I have any ideals.
But you do.
"All that you said to me, the first time we decided to do it about practising what we preach."
I did it to see if we could and then I did it for the pure love of killing.
But you...
I can't help thinking you've done it because of me.
For me.
Yes.
"But I also did it because... because, cos I..."
I didn't want to be a hypocrite.
I wanted to break free of the usual constraints.
"And yes because of you, Richard."
I admired you.
You're not like everyone else.
The rim-ram.
You're unique.
Hi.
"Her name's Carla Burns, lives around the corner."
Looks like she was coming home from work.
"OK, clear."
Anything left in her bag?
There was money still in there.
Doesn't look like a robbery.
"Broad daylight, no attempt to hide the body."
Another victim lying face up.
We've a weapon!
Even as we speak they'll be looking at the body of the woman you killed.
WE killed.
"Our clever friends will be piecing it all together, tying to make sense of it all."
I'm tired of all this Miss Scarlet in the ballroom with the dagger crap.
It's all so crass.
There was this kid I grew up with.
He was younger than me.
"Sort of looked up to me, you know."
We did our first work together.
Worked our way out of the street.
Things were good.
During Prohibition we ran molasses into Canada.
Made a fortune.
"Your father, too."
"As much as anyone, I loved him and trusted him."
Later on he had an idea to build a city out of a desert stop-over for G. I.s going to the West Coast.
That kid's name was Moe Greene and the city he invented was Las Vegas.
This was a great man.
A man of vision and guts.
"And there isn't even a plaque, signpost or statue of him in that town."
Someone put a bullet through his eye.
No one knows who gave the order.
"When I heard it, I wasn't angry."
"I knew Moe, I knew he was headstrong."
"Talking loud, saying stupid things."
"So when he turned up dead, I let it go."
"And I said to myself,"
"""This is the business we've chosen. """
"I didn't ask who gave the order, because it had nothing to do with business."
That two million in a bag in your room...
I'm going in to take a nap.
"When I wake, if the money is on the table, I know I have a partner."
"If it isn't, I know I don't."
Does everybody know everybody?
You know Senator Geary.
"Good to see you, Mike."
I'm glad we spend this time together.
Aren't you ashamed?
People will keep chasing us if we run.
They will stop only if we make them run instead.
"Tomorrow, by this time, we have the money in hand."
Nothing should stop that.
Understood?
You are the reason for all these!
We can't get any money from Varun.
All his money has been spent on his eye surgery.
Everything has messed up.
we have to leave empty-handed now!
Forget it.
We can't expect all our attempts to be successful.
One or two might go out of our hands.
Okay.
What's next?
I'll tell you.
And listen...
Give us our share.
"What are you saying, uncle?"
We won't get any money.
And you are talking about a share!
Look...
"From spying on Varun and drafting a plan for you, there has been no mistake from our side."
If the plan messes up in the last minute...
We can't help that.
- Hey...
You will get your share if the plan go as anticipated.
Or else...
The loss is for everyone.
"If you'd properly given our share earlier, why would I demand now?"
You always take the major share.
"- Yeah, I'd really love to believe you."
"I really would, because I don't even have to go to work this morning."
I would love to believe in a universe... where you wake up and you don't have to go to work... and you step outside and meet two beautiful 18 year-old sisters... who are also girlfriends... and... are also very nice people.
You guys seem like very nice people.
We are nice.
"What would you do... if you believed wewere 18, which we are?"
"Well, I can't even tell ya."
- I can't tell you till you're 18.
- That's not true.
What about freedom of speech and the Constitution?
- What are you talkin' about?
- Free speech.
Okay.
"Well, I don't know what you're talking about... but I can't talk dirty to you... because then I'd be a pervert... and probably even a pedophile too, so-"
- No one has ever talked dirty to us.
- Really?
Sounds very appealing.
I'm gonna go inside now.
Okay.
We'll wave to you.
- Make sure to look.
- I will.
"- Oh, he's probably jerking off."
"- Oh, my God!"
He is.
You can so tell he is.
- How?
- I can feel it.
See that crack?
That's where his hard-on is.
Let's kiss.
Okay.
"Weird lights, strange phone calls, you."
Seeing a UFO is one thing.
What do you do when someone tells you they saw this in their backyard?
What is it?
My wife died two years ago.
She saw something.
Drew pictures.
Who showed you this?
It was right here.
There was only a foot or so between its head and that branch.
That makes it about... eight feet tall.
Yeah.
I was getting ready for bed and just happened to glance out the window.
At first all I could see... were these two red eyes.
I kept looking at it.
I couldn't stop.
"I've never had that feeling before, like I couldn't move."
And then I guess itjust... took off..
"That may not make much sense, but it's... the only way I can put it into words."
"You didn't see it, did you?"
It started about two months ago.
Every time I answered the phone I'd hear it.
The first one was just a loud beeping noise.
"Now they're mostly these creaking, howling sounds."
They all like this?
"Well, once it was a man talking really fast."
- What'd he say?
- I couldn't make it out.
- Some foreign language.
- Have you had the line checked?
I even had our number changed.
But before I got a chance to give it out to anyone... the calls started again.
You will be connected to the voice mail after the beep.
"To record a message, press one."
"Please speak after the beep, then press the star or pound key."
I see you're not picking up.
"That day, I think I had too much on my mind and I was a bit afraid."
"Actually, I'm sure of myself, but I didn't do you right."
I called you because the sea is so beautiful.
There are so many idiots who take life for granted.
"In this beautiful place I've seen people fight over some money, and a couple argue."
It's disgusting.
You're beautiful.
Very beautiful.
Yes.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I'm a film director.
"Oh yes, my name is Kim Joongrae."
"If you're not busy, could I interview you?"
An interview?
"Yes, I'm working on a script."
And you look so much like one of the characters I'm creating.
"I'll offer you some compensation, though very small."
"Oh, no need for it."
I know who you are.
- Nice to meet you.
"- Oh, you do?"
Thank you.
- What kind of interview is it?
- It's real simple.
"If it's okay with you,"
"I'd like to ask about your life, just everyday stuff."
"Actually, I'm not used to this kind of thing."
"Lucy, you go first."
I want you to look at Joey and say hi.
"And Joey, after you've heard that,"
I want you to look back at Lucy and say hello in return.
"And then we'll just see where it goes from there, okay?"
Hi.
Hello.
"You kept saying ""open"" and ""fruitful"" and other weird stuff."
"That's not feeling, it's just more talking in short half-sentences, and you managed to turn feeling into a job or an activity, and it was exhausting."
So now it's my fault that you don't feel satisfied!
Everything is my fault?
Is that what you're saying?
I'm not saying that!
I'm crazy?
You don't look at me!
You don't ever ask me how I am!
I work!
You haven't looked at me in 10 years!
"I'm crazy and everything is my fault, and my family is awful, and nothing at all is your fault!"
"'Cause you rock, Joey!"
"If a guy talked to me like that, I'd punch him in the face."
You're such an asshole!
You're an asshole!
"It's like a little kid who gets a puppy for the first time, just hugs it so much, snaps its neck."
Cynthia's your puppy.
It's puppy-cradle death syndrome.
All that love is gonna snap that puppy.
"Yeah, but..."
You don't want that!
The dawning of a new day.
A marriage is not a timeless agreement.
It is one day.
The cops find it and the bastard gets it back.
In tip-top shape.
"He drives off happy as a clam, whistling away only what he doesn't know is we've fiddled with his car."
Unscrewed the front wheel.
Is just hanging on by a thread and not for long...
One day he's driving down a nice straight road going over a hundred smoking a manly cigarette a Marlboro...
"Then, all of a sudden..."
off comes the wheel...
How's that grab you?
Right on a curve...
Trees all over!
Absolutely!
The bastard asked for it!
You must be tired...
Why don't you sit down?
Since we'll probably never see you again we'd like to ask you for a favor.
Come on...
I'll be late to work.
"Well, les hear it..."
We'd like to touch you for good luck.
"OK, but make it quick!"
I don't want any trouble at work.
I never heard about is being so lucky...
Sure it is!
Touching something dirty brings good luck.
Like stepping in shit.
You bastards!
"Sure you're in the right place, Sonny?"
Got one for me?
Got a nice trim there around the ears...
Watch out or I'll trim yours!
Saturday haircut day?
Perhaps he began to hit the bottle?
It's all right if you don't want to tell.
"Oh, my God..."
"Nina, is that you?"
- Hi.
"- Oh, howdy!"
- Good to see you.
- Thank you.
I just dropped by to...
Why not?
You're still the master of the house.
"We have no masters here anymore, we had done away with masters back in 1917, so..."
"- Look, you goat."
- I beg your pardon?
"I mean, have you no conscience?"
Conscience?
No conscience.
"That's why you walk and whistle, lost your cap and don't give a thistle."
"You know, I've never understood those metaphors of yours."
"So you, the bandit, don't give a damn about your daughter, right?"
This is too serious a subject.
We'd better leave it for later.
"For now, let me take some things that are precious to me."
So you've come for precious things!
Not in the sense you mean.
Precious in the spiritual sense of the word.
- You'll do without.
- What do you mean?
Come when Nina's here.
You mean when the she-goat's here?
"Please don't misunderstand me, but if, as you put it, I'm a goat, then, naturally, my wife is a she-goat."
Oh boy!
"Then keep to it, if that's what's written."
Keep exactly to what is in the score.
Careful!
Here you made a mistake in the fingering.
This bar once more!
"Careful, a mistake in intonation!"
"The first mistake was at the beginning, these notes are long."
"This is a faster tempo, here we shorten the notes."
We'll speed it up a bit.
The other problem is this point.
"I couldn't practise much, we have visitors at home, I couldn't make so much noise."
"And could you let me go now, because the whole family is going to granddad's grave."
His brother's come.
What will you do at the cemetery?
I don't know.
Pay our respects.
This young boy has an id card.
"Everyone has, it can't be helped."
You must have some proof of identity.
She left it at home.
But they know me.
Haven't you got something from school?
You think I'm not fifteen?
Look how grown up she is.
"She is, that's not the point."
"If I've got an id card, she has too."
Must we always have it with us?
What's written on that board?
Young people under fifteen must show their id cards.
"Her age isn't written on her face, she must carry it all the time."
I always have to have it with me?
I can't help it.
That means I'll have chance to see you again!
"If it's not necessary to return it, I prefer keeping it."
"I can't be his woman,"
"I can't win his heart, now, I love to keep it for memory."
"Miss Shui, why do you like my master?"
"All women want to find a husband who is capable, a man who can protect her."
"Miss Shui, if there is a man, who is a bit stronger than you, but he can protect you, will you consider him?"
"People always look for the best, if I can't find a good husband,"
I prefer not marrying anyone else.
What a decent woman!
Bravo!
"Foon, a man should achieve something in his life."
"You'd better forget loving affair, the world will be your oyster, you'd fight for your future."
Where should I go to fight for my future?
Isn't it all the go?
Yeah...
Really?
Let me take a look!
Isn't it popular in Britain now?
What?
See!
What do you mean?
Look at me!
Look at my look!
Oh!
Look!
You speak fluent English.
It's wise of me to let you study in Britain.
I'm right to bring this present to you.
See!
You look really smart.
Even a deaf guy can hear that... you spoke whole-heartedly.
"And just because I am a woman, they do not have the courtesy to tell me where they are going or when they will be back."
I'm a man.
That's right!
Which makes this even worse.
I'm going to Tony again.
(phone ringing)
We're doing our best to keep the investigation closed.
Clayton?
"Uh, no update yet, Mr. Wickes."
We're trying to keep this out of the press.
"The less our shooter knows, the better off we are."
"Okay, we're asking these people to not say anything about what they saw."
I saw a man with a gun.
"Right, I got that."
So you're going to be in this group.
"You're going to answer their questions, then you're going to go home."
Okay?
You're going to lay low and you're going to tell your people that you need some personal time.
"No, I don't want that."
I want him kept separate from the group.
He was standing next to Jarvis.
He had a better view than anybody.
"The gunman, he was wearing a blue hat."
I saw him.
"Okay, okay."
"We're going to put you with a sketch artist,"
You write down everything you remember.
"Of course, anything."
VANCE:
Gibbs.
"Massive blood loss, doesn't look good."
His family's been notified.
It was a non-alcoholic reception.
"I was like, ""I hope they get diarrhea on the honeymoon."""
That's not a very nice thing to say.
"I was like, ""Really?"
"I was gonna say I hope they die tonight."""
Nothing gets me on the dance floor like a big old pint of sweet tea!
"I like to be fully present in the moment, fully aware I'm not a good dancer."
The sweet tea reminds me every step of the way.
I've used a Fleshlight before.
"Guys, don't be like that."
Don't be like that.
"I was at a show, doing a festival in Texas."
They gave all the performers a gift bag.
In the gift bag there was a free Fleshlight.
I don't know if they gave us those as a joke.
I didn't take it as one.
I pulled myself aside... and immediately reprioritized my entire afternoon.
"I said, ""Rory, we skipped lunch before."
Didn't kill us then.
"Will not kill us now."""
"""Fuck this thing!"" Out loud in a hotel lobby."
"""I gotta get my dick out!"
"I gotta do it!"""
"Some women in this crowd, you're like, ""I think it's gross he used a Fleshlight."""
Some women don't care.
"Some women still think I said ""flashlight."""
Now you know who you are.
So do the people around you.
"""Well, then what is it?"" ""I don't fucking know."
Dude fucking loves 9/11.
I don't know.
"I don't know."""
Let us hit them again.
Let us reform and hit them again.
I know we can do it.
"God bless you, gentlemen."
"They're forming over there, Major."
I do fear they may attack.
"Yes, sir."
General Pickett.
You may reform to the rear of this ridge and set up a defensive position.
"General Pickett, sir."
You must look to your division.
General Lee.
I have no division.
General...
We will withdraw as soon as we have secured all those wounded or who are well enough to be moved.
If we can reach the Potomac and cross over into Virginia there will be no more immediate danger.
"But I'll need your help, Pete."
I'm so very tired.
"What can I do, sir?"
General?
We must look to our own deportment.
The spirit of the army is still very good.
Very good indeed.
We will do better another time.
They do not die for us.
Not for us.
That at least is a blessing.
If this war goes on...
And it will.
It will.
"What else can we do but go on, you and I?"
It's always the same question forever.
"I don't know, I've had feelings for Jamie for quite a long time."
Really?
Yeah.
Romantic feelings?
"Yeah, all my sexual fantasies about Jamie Oliver don't really actually contain sex."
What do they contain?
"Well, it's really, it's sort of..."
"He's in the kitchen, he's cooked me a roast chicken."
"And then he, like, draws me a bath."
"And then I, when I come out of the bath, I come back into the kitchen, and he's just, like, washed up and tidied everything away."
"Oh, stop it!"
And that's it.
Did you say sexual fantasy?
"Yeah, but that's the thing about being with Jamie, there's no pressure to put out."
Yeah.
That's what I like about him.
"I mean, in this fantasy, though, is the bath really hot?"
"And then you look down, and there's carrots in it as well?"
"You'd want to worry about, like, if I was his wife, I'd feel really sad."
Jules?
"Yeah, Jules, Jules."
"Because, like, he'd come home and go..."
She don't like her.
Yeah.
"Um, if I was his current first wife... ..Jules, and he was telling me, ""Oh, you look gorgeous."""
"""I just saw you on the BBC calling a trout gorgeous!"
"""How am I supposed to feel?"""
"He's got so many kids, in't he?"
"It's like Daisy Boo, Poppy, Honey, River Rocket, he's running out of names!"
"Next one he'll be like,"
"""What should we call this, Spaghetti Pete?"
"I don't know."""
The image of them having sex was so strong it kept recurring.
I wanted to fight it off.
"I read books, filled up volumes of my journal, but I couldn't overcome it."
I nearly wanted to go to a mental hospital everyday.
"Rationally, I knew I was a hopeless fool."
But I kept having a dirty feeling.
"She had a really hard time, too."
For several years.
I'm afraid you'll go through the same thing.
"I like you very, very much, but why'd you sleep with a foreigner, stupid?"
It's too strong of an image to overcome.
I'm afraid I'll go through that once again.
I don't think I could take it again.
"Hello, did you have breakfast?"
Not yet.
Did you?
"Yes, we did."
Would you like to have some bean sprout soup?
It's so easy to make.
We have all the ingredients.
Sounds good.
"But, my friend's here with me."
We're going to take a look around for a bit.
"Okay, then, see you later."
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Why are you two so close?
"Oh, I interviewed her yesterday."
I did it for my script.
We had a drink afterwards.
Enough.
Don't say more.
So you've thought about where you'll put everything?
Like the interior design?
Yes.
"Yes, I have, Peter."
If this was the kitchen...
I'd like there to be a little nook right over there by the window.
Like the booth of a restaurant.
And there'd be an island right where the light is hanging... and the island would have the stove in it... and a countertop on one side with tall stools under it.
My daughter would sit on a stool... so I could talk to her while I was making dinner or lunch.
What would you say to her?
I'd say...
"""Hi, baby girl."
"You are a precious treasure."""
"I'd live up there, if I could."
If there wasn't gravity.
Yeah.
But if you lived up there... then all this stuff... all this stuff in my room... would fall down on you and crush you... and you'd die.
Ellen would have been so proud of you.
"Isn't it amazing, Ellen?"
Yes.
I'm so glad you took me here.
It was a whole civilization.
Two Mayan people in love... probably stood right where we're standing now and thought...
"""Look what we have built together."""
"And now they're gone, and so is the city."
And there's just... us.
I am done.
That was great.
- Eldercab.
- Hi.
- I'm feeling too old to drive.
- Yeah?
"Come on, Magnum."
"Go, Magnum, go.!"
Hit it!
Remember.!
Knees to chest.!
"Chop-chop, chaps."
To the van.
Come on.
I was dying.
"Everything confirmed it... my lungs, my head, my aching muscles."
"So, I concentrated on Roger."
I tried to think of all the reasons Roger didn't leave the island... when he knew the mafia and the feds were on his tail.
It came down to either a great love for Babs... or he couldn't get his hands on the money.
Yeah.
I settled on the money too.
"I thought of all the ways it might be tied up... investments, stocks, gold, land... ways that would take a while to liquidate."
After 26 miles...
I decided it was none of the above.
"He'd hidden it somewhere, and he couldn't put his hands on it immediately."
"By the time I got on the bicycle, I was ready to fall over dead."
I'd never make a hundred miles.
There was no way.
Not even if I concentrated on Roger and his problem.
Impossible.
But I had to try.
Beauty Knows No Pain.
He'd hidden the money.
He had to.
"The statute of limitations was almost up, but he couldn't get it because... it was inaccessible."
I had it.
I had the answer.
"Only I was so damn tired, I couldn't pull it out of my brain."
Mm-hmm.
Just came by 'cause I need a little favor.
None of your favors are little.
"Okay, you know what?"
I'm done flirting.
I'm not in the mood.
"I got to get in touch with that guy you told me about, the smuggler -- Schmidt was his name."
The guy you said could move anything or anybody.
Why do I tell you things?
Why?
"'Cause I think deep down, you like me."
No.
"No, that's not it."
"Okay, look, the point is, we got to get out of town with fresh I.D.s, okay -- someplace warm, with decent beer."
That's why we need Schmidt.
"W-well, I'm sorry."
"Your timing sucks, okay?"
Schmidt's in hiding.
He's in some sort of trouble.
"No cell, no e-mail, no nothing."
"You know, it's funny -- I bet the guy who builds his computer systems could find him."
"Say, wasn't that you, Dixon?"
Even if I could -- and I'm not saying that I can -- there is zero chance that he'll talk to you.
"All right, Dixon."
Thanks a lot.
You're welcome.
Really appreciate it.
"But, you know, before I go, I thought I would just say"
I think it's great that a company like this would hire a convicted hacker!
Should I go on?
Shh.
"How about the Navy, when they almost court-martialed you for stealing the skipper's porn collection?"
It's just... it's never gonna end until we stop her.
"Look, Bastion employs 130 people."
I can't endanger their livelihoods if I can fix this in one night.
Right.
You're right.
"If she wants you to help her organize and find a location, that's a small price to pay."
When's the last time we did it in front of the mirror?
Grace... she didn't just come over to talk about the location.
Her name is Audrey.
She's going to be my date.
She's beautiful.
I'm sure you'll show her a good time.
You gonna jump?
Oh!
"You know, with my luck,"
I'd end up surviving the fall and end up eating my food through a straw the rest of my life.
You sure you should be smoking?
You just got out of the hospital.
Are you freaking kidding me?
A heart attack would be fantastic right about now.
Can I turn this off?
"Look, everything's going to be fine, Victor."
I just need you to show me every illegal transaction that you've made.
"I promise you, it will only stay between us."
Are you wearing a wire?
Huh?
What the hell is the matter with you?
"You're with them, aren't you?"
The SEC.
They got you to cooperate.
"Victor, I'm here to help."
All right?
"If you attend our fundraising event next week, we promise not tell everyone that you're a..."
Despicable liar.
"Well, I guess that I,"
I don't really have a leg to stand on.
"No, and while we're on that subject, work on your limping."
"Oh, and get dark glasses."
You'll be blind by then.
"Oh, there you are."
Your mum went out looking for you.
I know.
"Oh, I lost her two streets over."
"Look, she made a mistake."
But she was just trying to get you to talk.
I know.
And how does that make you feel?
What?
Never mind.
I'm gonna tell you how it makes you feel.
"See, for the past week, I've been seeing therapists... and they've been trying to get me to talk."
But I don't like it.
Partly because it's none of their bloody business.
But mostly because I'm afraid if...
"I do start to open up and let it out,"
I might completely fall apart.
Is that how it makes you feel?
"Yeah, that's pretty much it."
So I just don't wanna talk about it at all.
"But it doesn't make you any less angry, does it?"
No.
"Look, I understand."
My dad left my mum... and it really messed with my head and my trust.
"And when I was in my 20s,"
Of course I'm gonna help you.
"Well, what am I, not gonna help you?"
"I just--like I said, I can't, I gotta--"
"I can't, I got the thing."
I-I got a shift.
"Uh-huh, and what would happen to the shift if I said I wanted to fuck you tonight?"
[chuckles]
"Well, I mean... ♪♪"
Could probably get it covered.
♪♪
Hi.
- [clears throat]
- What are we doing?
Diffusing the sexual tension that's ruining our friendship.
"Okay, so, you want this?"
"Well, if this is what it takes for us to become friends again, then yes, but this is a one-time offer only, okay?"
This is for you to get it out of your system.
"Well, what if I need more than one time?"
One time.
"[music continues, muffled]"
Okay.
No eye contact?
"Well, it's a tight space."
"Um, just the fumes are making me gag, so let's, like, move this along, okay?"
A little impersonal.
"Well, I'm gonna throw you a look over my shoulder every now and then like this."
"Oh, thanks."
"That's more of a ""I stole your parking space"" look than it is of, uh, arousal."
"[sighs] Well, I'll keep that in mind, try to make it better."
[chuckles]
This floor is disgusting.
[clears throat]
"Mother, it's 8:00."
We have a rehearsal in Tokyo today.
We know about your rehearsal.
Go right ahead.
Mother.
"You met Takehara, didn't you?"
"Yes, I did."
Is he doing well?
"Yes, he is."
You seem to be meeting him often.
Is there something going on?
"I had to talk to him about selling the ""Hana."""
You have to talk with him about that?
He used to rent it out.
That's kind of a strange way to do things.
Why do you have to ask him for permission?
I'm not.
"Ah, so you're not finished with him."
Is that what it is?
I have to go.
"Mother, it's funny but don't you think that there was more peace in the house during the war."
"Yes, I think so."
"Back then, everyone got along, and it wasn't like it is now with everyone going their separate ways."
Perhaps it's my fault.
We didn't worry about unnecessary things back then.
That's true.
It was because our freedom was taken away from us.
"If it hadn't been for the war, you would be in England or France dancing at a ballet school."
"Yes, that's right."
And I might have gone with you.
The war delayed my studies.
"If it hadn't been for the war, even if I had kept studying with you, I might be teaching my own children now."
Congratulations!
You're marrying my sister!
"And you spared no expense, ya big crazy."
You know what?
"I love Barney, but this ring thing sucks."
Some gross guy just brushed up against my rack and then apologized.
"And I think he really, really meant it."
"Oh, sweetie, I know it's nice to be groped by strangers... but nothing beats the rush you get when that one special person looks at you."
It's true.
"Like here in this bar, there's only one thing that I see."
And I see her brighter and more clearly... than anything else in this world.
You know what that is?
That's love.
And possibly alcohol mixed... with some very powerful antibiotics.
And that's how Barney sees you.
And I know that's how you see Barney.
Stay back or I'll shoot him!
"Appreciate what you're trying to do, son."
"Did the same job myself, and proudly."
"I have no quarrel with you, but I do have a deadline."
So put the gun down..
Pull the pin.
Because you're not gonna shoot the president.
You're right.
"Where does that leave us, boys?"
That leaves us with this.
Come on!
"Go, go, go!"
What are you doing?
!
"Oh, no."
"Come on, go!"
You keep struggling through the years.
Then a day comes and you find yourself locked outside the door.
Thank you!
Sorry for the trouble.
"You know, Mert has been in school for a long time and he still hasn't graduated."
"Do you, or his father, ever talk to him about this matter?"
He doesn't have a father.
We're separated.
"No matter how much you care, guys are guys."
Aren't they all the same?
"One day, he just left us..."
Mert was 11 years old when he left.
Didn't he ever call his son after that?
Never.
We started a life with Mert.
Just like a friend...
"Look at Mrs. Guler, she's never had a happy day."
"Just when she brought her son up, this is what happened."
"Having a mother like you, why did Mert turn out to be like this?"
Mert isn't the child you think he is.
He just wanted to work.
He said the streets are filled with unemployed people and wanted to start... earning money as soon as possible.
Does he work?
Yes.
"But he's studying really hard now, he's back in school."
He'll enter the selection exam too.
He doesn't want to hurt me anymore.
I think my illness played a big role in that.
What did the doctors say?
I hope it's nothing serious?
"The doctors have said she'd be alright, but..."
I have cancer.
Mr. Lin?
Come in.
"Mr. Lin, your brother and his girlfriend were killed at the beach car park on Sept 3."
We suspect they fought back and were killed.
We found a metal ruler at the crime scene.
We matched the prints on the ruler to a Lo Keung
We shouldn't show you these but you were once a brilliant cop in China.
We hope... you understand.
"You can provide us more info and facts, then we can solve this case."
"I remember he has a diamond watch and a belt,"
a wallet with a photo of us.
Well done!
The whole HK knows.
I've never seen so many letters of praise but there're just as many complain letters.
They're all yours!
Tell me.
Why all this for a small robber?
You caused major road chaos in Central.
So who is going to back you up next time?
"Sir, a small robber is still a robber."
We shouldn't discount them.
"Also, there were hostages to protect."
Who do you think you are?
Superhero?
No one likes you in the whole station!
"I don't care, I just want to do my job."
I don't care.
This is the police.
We've rules to follow.
"If not for your father asking his friends to call the Chief, you'd have been fired."
Get lost and be your rich playboy!
Get out!
Do you have any idea why he left?
I'm not sure.
I'd only be guessing.
You hesitated.
Why?
I don't know.
You know what he did during that year and a half?
"He was in the Navy, he said."
"Do you imply that he came home from the war, from combat duty just to beat you up?"
"-We object, your Honor!"
The defendant has implied no such thing.
-Sustained.
-Did your stepfather... own the house you live in?
-My brother and I fixed it up.
"-Answer the question, please."
-It wasn't a house when...
"-Please, answer the question."
Yes.
"But it was a dirty shack, and nothing else!"
"But you had the freedom to come and go, and... invite boys in... and answer to no one while Lucas was gone, didn't you?"
"Yes, I had the freedom, but I never did!"
"When you thought he was going to change all that, did you kill him?"
No!
Lucas was drunk and tried to beat me!
"The coroner testified... that Lucas was unconscious from the first or second blow... so you'd say you'd end the beating then, but you didn't stop."
Why?
I don't know.
You kept beating him until you crushed life out of him.
Why?
I don't know!
I couldn't stop.
I couldn't stop.
"We boys go, but girls go as well, but it's the first time that..."
"Marcel, you never laugh."
I never laugh?
"You don't know... I don't know you, but it seemed to me... I laugh so much that I've paid for it."
Why?
Some teachers don't like it.
"Even so, you seemed sad to me."
I'm like that too. I find it hard to get to know people.
One for six.
"- For how much have you, please?"
"- For seven, six and five."
"- Two for six, please."
- They're sold out for today.
Then for seven.
They're all sold out.
Couldn't you manage it somehow?
Those two for six.
"I promised the teacher, but I came late."
"Wait here, I'm just going to get out of playing the trombone."
"Don't show yourself much near the cinema, mum teaches here, I've got tickets, we'll pop off to that cinema."
You're going to play the trombone now?
You enjoy playing?
"I took it up, it was for free, I could play."
Have you performed anywhere?
"On May Day, we gave a concert in a village."
So I'm going to get it over and done with.
"All right, I'll wait for you."
Careful!
"The same melody is repeated half way through, but the first time it's piano, and the second time...?"
- Mezzo-forte.
- And which is louder?
Mezzo-forte.
I think Roman is pulling some kind of stunt.
What're you talking about?
"Well, he just tore out of here in his car and he took all his stuff with him."
"Ryan, you know he's not allowed to leave the state."
"Alright, I'm coming back."
They both suffered total cardiac arrest.
Paramedics revived them on their way in but there were no signs of cognitive response from either one.
- We're assessing...
- Which one is my husband?
Can he hear me?
It's possible.
We really can't tell at this stage.
"""Casey"""
Do you want a chair?
"No, I'm not gonna stay long."
Not sure if he'd want me to.
I'm sure he appreciates it.
"Anything happens, you'll let me know?"
Either way.
Of course.
You're sweet.
Just like he said.
Mrs. Bryson?
Can we speak for a moment?
We can keep your husband on the machine so long as there is lower brain function.
And we will keep monitoring but...
It's been three weeks now.
What are you saying?
The chances of him waking are very small.
Like what?
There's no way of telling.
It could be months.
To be seen together ?
Why are you getting mad ?
I'm just being honest.
Nobody wants to see us together.
We spend more time defending our relationship than having one.
It'sjust... so hard.
Everything's gotta be easy ?
"That's the story ofyour life, not mine."
You know this much about my life.
"I know when shit gets rough, you give up and punk out."
Just the way you punked out on ballet when your mom died.
You don't know shit about my mother.
How dare you talk about my mom !
God !
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.
It'sjust that... all this shitjust kind of caught me off guard.
"I mean, it's, like, damn, you don't wanna be with me."
"is that what you're saying, that you don't want to be with me ?"
"No, it's not like that."
"I'm trying to tell you how I feel, and you're taking it personal."
"Let me tell you something, Sara."
I just hit the best friend I have in the world in the face overyou.
I've been taking shit from people I've known all my life.
"People I care about, that care about me so I could be with you."
Telling myselfthat we are in this together.
"So, don't give me this ""nothing personal."" l don't wanna hear it."
"Fine. lf l'm messing up your life so much, then maybe we shouldn't be together."
You know what ?
I don't need this shit.
ldon't even know whylbother.
I'm out.
None.
"I'm on student loans at u.C.L.A.,"
And my parents don't give me
Any financial support whatsoever.
How much is this gonna cost me?
We'll do it for free.
Free to her.
I didn't say we won't get paid.
"Book rights,movie rights--"
"Press like this, we're gonna get paid."
Trust me.
"I told you we'd handle it, but we've gotta move fast."
Take her purse and her cell phone.
"News coverage means the chance of you getting a fair trial is going down by the second,"
So we've got to do everything we can before we turn you in.
You just need to answer one question.
I told you.
It was self-Defense.
That's not the question.
Don't guess!
Ron.
What did you do with the knife?
Threw it away?
That's not good.
"Plus,she's too calm to have just killed someone."
"She's not calm,alden."
She's numb.
Not too numb to come here instead of going to the cops.
You think she's lying to us?
A married man and a college girl go to a hotel room together--
"Someone's lying about something, and that's before anyone dies."
The d.A. Will argue that she ditched the knife
No.
It's all right.
It's fine.
"Come on, come in."
"Um, I got your tea if you want me to make you some."
Sure.
"Yeah, that'd be nice."
"Of all the dozens of women you've been with, you must have fallen in love plenty of times."
Right?
What's this really about?
Neil.
"His, um, his other job..."
"We're working on being more open, but this little voice inside my head isn't so sure."
"So if I fell in love with you,"
"Neil could fall in love with one of his dates, too."
"Grace, you were the only one."
"Come on, I'm serious."
You don't do what I do and catch feelings.
It's the ultimate transgression.
You were it.
So you just sleep with all these women and you never feel anything intimate?
In passing.
It's that way with a lot of people.
Clients and escorts.
That's the fantasy.
That's... that's why this business is booming.
"When I met you, I was hungry for something more, emotionally."
But you were never going to leave Neil.
"It took me a while to figure that out, but..."
Neil's gonna be seeing someone tonight.
Someone I selected.
But I don't want to be the wife who sets rules and tells him what he can and can't do.
What's that look?
- What look?
"- The look, right there."
The one you get when you worry.
Nothing.
Nah.
"When you're done with host committee, why don't you come on inside."
"I'll be in the library with your uncle, okay?"
Senator.
I got to meet with the FCC.
They didn't know what hit 'em.
Thanks so much for coming.
Thanks for your help.
"Thanks for your help, I really appreciate it."
A pleasure.
I'm making breaching charge.
The last one I used blew the hinges off
A metal door in Kandahar.
"I need you to get me through security, into your police station, and then into the evidence lockers."
Narco seized a ton of heroin and cash last week.
That's what he's after.
"Listen, I don't expect you to believe me, but if I don't get that money, a lot of people are gonna die."
"Look, I'm sorry."
"Okay, I didn't wake up this morning thinking this was gonna happen to me, either."
"I don't want to hurt anybody, but here's the deal."
"You're gonna do what I say, when I say it."
"You're gonna rob the station, that's crazy."
Yeah.
I keep hearing that.
"Isaac, we can't let him do this."
I want to talk to him.
To try to change his mind?
He was gonna propose to her.
What's that got to do with anything?
It's got everything to do with it!
"Jared would do anything for Dana, and she knew it, too."
"That's why she wanted to straighten out her life, l-look for a way out."
Dana was part of the heist crew.
"Yeah, but..."
but she wanted to quit.
For Jared.
Except they wouldn't let her.
Who's they?
The rest of the team?
"No, no, no."
Not everyone was involved.
I wasn't either.
I didn't know about the robberies until Dana told me at the hospital.
I swear.
"So, what was Dana's job on the crew?"
"She was the getaway driver, but like I said, she wanted out, she threatened to come clean if they didn't let her go."
"So, what, they stabbed Jared to warn her?"
They found out that Dana was gonna tell him the truth about the heists.
"She convinced Jared not to go to the hospital, so he wouldn't get hurt worse."
"Dana couldn't tell Jared the truth, either."
She just asked him to... to trust her.
And the money in Jared's garage.
It was her cut.
She decided to tell...
Jared the truth this weekend and... somehow they found out.
Which is why they killed Jared.
"And they... and they threatened to kill her and, um... and me, too, if... if she tried anything else."
That's why I was afraid to tell you the truth.
They're vicious.
"You're such a nice man, and I actually did have a great time the other night, but I'm just not looking for a relationship right now."
"I mean, the... the truth is, I haven't had sex in three years."
Really?
You wouldn't know it the way you jumped right back in with the dirty talk.
"Okay, no, look, Stan, listen, you are my one under the belt, okay, a fling, all right?"
"But it's over, it's finished."
Wow.
That's too bad.
'Cause I really like you.
You're so foxy and nice.
I even... made you this mix tape.
Oh.
You remembered my favorite band is Supertramp.
"Well, I slept with him again."
"And it was even worse this time, because he made me feel so self-conscious about the dirty talk."
Hi.
"I'm your brother, and I think you remember your ex-husband, Richard."
"Yeah, Matthew was just filling me in."
He didn't mention the dirty talk.
I didn't even know about the dirty talk.
Now I got to go call Mom back.
Don't!
Don't!
I can't believe Matthew told you.
Don't blame Matthew.
I already heard about it.
It's all over school.
The fourth graders are doing their class project on it.
Christine... what are you doing?
I don't know.
"It was our conversation the other day, okay?"
"You're right, I haven't had sex in three years, you know?"
That's the most conceited statement.
"But if she starts to interrupt, he shrinks her back and puts her away."
I understand.
"What you're saying is, women are made to be loved."
- ls that what I'm saying?
"- lt's a confession that a woman may drive you crazy, but you wouldn't trust her."
"And because you couldn't put her in your pocket, you'd get mix ed up."
I don't understand what does it.
What did it f or Johnny?
"The trouble is, it happened to Johnny but it didn't happen to me."
- At least not as intensely.
- That's what he was af raid of.
I was going with him because he was the nicest person I'd ever met.
And I'm lonely.
You're right about women being made f or love.
But what happens when it never comes the way you want it?
Like music that never reaches a pitch?
"What do you do, go on singing songs and drinking Ramos gin fizzes?"
Yeah I can see why Johnny loved you.
- And why he couldn't reach you.
"- l loved him, Rip."
It's just....
There's some people you feel you can talk to.
"They come along, they sit beside you in your car."
"Only, the f unny thing is, it's never happened bef ore."
- That's crazy to say.
- You're the one that's mix ed up.
- But I'm not mix ed up.
- Get back in my pocket.
"Do me a f avour, park it f or a while."
I'd like to be alone with the lady.
"Caref ul, I'm the marrying type."
We're gonna need that tank.
Having a good time?
Yeah.
"By the way, I think I saw April making out with Shep Cale."
"All right, all right."
You need to stop drinking.
Listen.
Read this.
It's a speech.
"Figure you should have something ready, so you don't embarrass yourself."
"You mean so I don't embarrass you, because you don't have to worry."
"Oh, is that how you spell ""venereal disease""?"
"Jake, this day is important to me, okay?"
Just because your life's a big joke doesn't mean you have to treat mine that way.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
Why is my life a joke?
Just read the speech.
"No, seriously, Eric, why is my life a joke?"
I'm not getting into this right now.
All right.
You think people don't wonder what you've been doing?
You spend all that time in flight school getting your license.
"Instead of using it, you come back here, and you hang out like it's the summer after high school."
Hauling stuff for Emily's dad.
"Well, hey, if I'm such a joke, then why'd you want me as your best man?"
"You didn't want me, did you?"
"No, not really."
Where's that tank?
We're not going to last long against those trucks.
We have to hold out.
Ow!
Damn it!
"Listen, I know that you and Eric aren't close and maybe you didn't feel like standing up in front of a bunch of people and... acting like you were."
Sometimes doing what you feel like doing and doing what needs to be done are two different things.
"You don't have to worry about me, Dad."
I'm fine.
I somehow get the feeling my worrying days are far from over.
But they will be one day.
"One day, I know you're gonna become the man I know you can be, the man you were born to be."
"My God, that day's gonna be something to see."
"Come on, Johnston."
This scotch ain't gonna drink itself.
Me and the old man are gonna head down to the lake and share some 30-year-old single malt.
You want to come?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm just gonna...
"wait for Emily, say good night."
"I'll, uh... meet you there."
I'll save you a place.
Where's he going?
"Oh, he's waiting for Emily."
Gonna say good night.
Well... that's the last we'll see of him tonight.
Dad.
"Ah... listen, if I had a girl that looked like that,"
I wouldn't keep her waiting.
"Hey, you hear that, boy?"
I'm gonna take tha girl away from you.
"Yeah, you talk a good game."
"Eh, you better watch out for yourself, too."
Your wife is crazy about me.
"Oh, my wife wants to take a hickory switch to you three times a day."
"Jake, it's Constantino."
- l don't want to hear of it!
And if a guest should leave me a tip for tidying up?
"No. I'll tell you something, you know what."
Yes.
You sometimes bring a tip from a wedding and you say:
"It was good, we got 150 crowns."
Don't pass judgment on me.
Don't compare yourself with me!
I'm just advising you.
But they may leave something there for me.
The main is for you to learn German.
"But if they leave money for me, what should I do?"
Don't complicate things again!
I'm afraid Mi?
ka might be naive.
She'll be easily taken in.
"I certainly don't want it to be like in that song, when he was tired of flying from one flower to another... I insist that when Mi?"
"ka one day falls in love, she should stay with him."
So she isn't a flighty little flower.
"Wait a minute, don't shut it!"
"Come on, quick!"
Our daughter's going to Austria and you shut the gates in front of us.
I keep saying they ought to make a footbridge here.
I know it's not your fault.
We're late because of you.
So many different hats and we miss the train.
But that's not our train!
"That's not our train, is it?"
"It's not, but we should already be there."
Come on!
Quick!
Quick!
"Well then, let's get back to business, cos I'm late for my ballet class."
Finish the job or face the consequences.
Am I clear?
Well...
"I got news for you, Number One."
"Given the situation, I see why you're T.O and all."
"But, what's done is done."
And my partner comes first.
- What's that supposed to mean?
"- It means... that if you try to take her out or get into the middle of our job, you're in front world of hurt!"
"I know what you're capable of, but we're pros too."
We also know that you're comin' now.
Do you know what I wanted to be when I was your age?
I don't either.
I like you kid.
"You're in over your head and you're scared, yet you look death in the eye without blinking."
"It's admirable, but it won't save you."
It won't save your partner and it won't save your new pal.
Finish the job or face the consequences.
You've got an hour.
Sorry about that stuff I said before.
What's them?
When I called you stupid and stuff.
That's okay.
Did you find anymore bullets all around?
Hey.
Wanna hear somethin'?
Your daughter doesn't hate you.
How do you know?
I know.
"Well, could you?"
You never even met her.
So what are you after?
Reaching for the moon?
Nope.
Just one little star.
On a dressing room door.
"Want to be a playactress, huh?"
"Oh, i am one."
I barnstormed through the midwest for two seasons.
This is the only job i could get in new york.
But i don't care - at least i'm in a theater.
"Before i get through, i'm going to be a great actress."
That's the way to say it.
"Think big, talk big, and you'll be big."
"Say, you're a good looker."
Got the spirit of a thoroughbred.
All you need is a little sprucing up.
"Here, get into this."
You and me are going to paint the town.
"I've got some acting for you to do, and you'll put that fleurique in the shade."
But these are her clothes.
That's stealing.
Only little people steal.
Big people call it borrowing.
But-but what will mademoiselle say?
I can't wear her clothes.
You certainly can't wear that hired gal's rig where we're going.
Where are we going?
To the astor house.
You've got a sight of gall.
And i'm daring you to show some.
"She threw things at you, didn't she?"
"Listen, when you're scratching for corn and another chicken comes along and shoves you out of the way, get right back into that circle and make the feathers fly."
What does she think of herself?
Calm down!
Shut up and listen to me!
What the fuck do you think you are doing!
Come to your senses!
Have you lost it!
I don't know what kind of tuitions you have been giving.
But learn this from me.
Take out your sim card!
Stay away from them they are rich and connected!
They will get you busted so bad you won't know what hit you!
Give me the sim card I will throw it away.
If you throw my sim card then how will my sisters call me?
Give them my number!
And what if someone calls you?
- Have you ever heard my phone ring?
Use my card and give them this number.
I am not going to let her get away with this!
I will cut her to pieces!
Don't talk shit.
We are out of booze as well!
Come...
Come on...
This godforsaken town is a real shit hole!
You place your trust in people thinking they are your friends.
But the moment you turn around they ram it right up your ass.
I'll go give this number to my sisters.
"Ok, but now don't go stressing them out as well."
"Hello, Sonu!"
Are you alright?
Who's number is this?
"It's a friend's number, save it on your phone."
"He'd found out about Johnny's letter, so he'd silenced Louis too."
And Louis' body was to block me out of the play with a murder rap.
"I had to get rid of Louis before the cops followed up Martinelli's next play, an anonymous tip to pay me a call."
Should I kick it in?
It may have been a phoney tip.
I don't know where it came f rom.
"- lt's you, the smart guy f rom Frisco."
- You're better than I thought.
- How'd you locate me?
- Mind if we take a look around?
Mind?
Why should I mind?
What's a little sleep?
You mind telling me what you're looking f or?
"Maybe that guy you was looking f or, Charlie Wilson."
- What do you know about that corpse?
"- Same as you, nothing."
You heard the report about that car smash.
That's why the rental job with a police call-band.
You knew that guy had been taken f or a ride.
You guys murder me.
- That's the only radio the shop had.
- l bet.
"If you'd stop playing smart, I might help."
"Where'd you get the head, the Sanctuary Club?"
You're a day early f or Easter bunnies.
You had a row with Louis Ord. What'd you threaten him about?
- Why don't you ask him?
- Don't think I won't.
"You don't object to my going back to bed, do you?"
"I got a habit of sleeping late, often right up to 6."
How long you known Coral Chandler?
"Be there, Thursday church, or never after look me in the face."
- I...
- Speak not.
"Reply not, do not answer me."
My fingers itch!
"My lord, you're in the wrong, my lord, to punish her."
Is that my lady wisdom's view?
Take care.
You dice with your place in talking thus.
May not one speak?
"Oh, will you be quiet, you fool!"
- Now...
"- No, husband, you are too hot."
"God's blood, it does make me mad!"
"Day, night, month, year!"
My constant care... has been to have my only child worthily matched.
"And here I find an educated man of equal birth with honorable parts, with fine estates and handsome to behold, and what is my reward?"
"A puking fool, who answers, ""I'll not wed."
I cannot love.
I am too young.
"I pray you pardon me."""
Now think on this.
Thursday is near.
"If you will play the bride, then are you my daughter and all is forgot."
"If you will not, then you are mine no more."
Graze where you will.
You shall not house with me.
"Beg, starve or hang,"
"I'll ne'er acknowledge thee, nor pass to you the slightest thing that's mine."
"I swear to this, my word, so help me God!"
How can Father speak so to a child who loves him better than she loves herself?
"Oh, oh, God."
You made me crazy.
"You,like,told me to look for the signs."
"Like bird poop and lightning bolts or,like,actual signs?"
"I don't know if you've noticed, but there's a lot of signage out there in the world."
I told you only to pay attention to the really obvious ones.
"The signs,thus far,have been conflicting."
Would you like me to come with you and show you the correct ones?
I could ring a bell and point.
"This is not about me,okay?"
A very nice person could get hurt.
Nice people get hurt every day.
"Sometimes,it's good for them."
"Did I,like,screw you out of land during the Renaissance or something?"
Why do you hate me so much?
- This is me liking you.
"- Well,can you stop?"
"And,seriously,how are you so slim?"
Here's what you got right.
Ready?
It's not just about you.
That's all you're getting.
"You want a burger,baby?"
No.
So how am I the stupidest person in the world?
When did that happen?
I think you've been working towards that for a while.
I am totally stuck.
I cannot break up with him again.
"He's the most loving,open guy."
All he wants to do is give and share.
The absolute worst word you can use to describe a guy is what?
"""Busty""? ""Emotional."""
"Just take your time, and while you're at it, you might want to tighten your socks, because they're about to get knocked off."
Why did you tell him that we have a great idea?
"Honey, what do you think, one's just gonna walk in the front door?"
"And now, thanks to you,"
I have to wear this stupid eye patch.
It's not my fault.
Face it.
"You liked me when I was mousy, and now that that's changed, you can't handle it."
Nonsense!
All I've ever been is a protective big sister.
"Then how come when you had an eyebrow-waxing business, you never got rid of my unibrow?"
Why would you want me to?
So you could be sexy for God?
That's sick.
So tell me the idea.
"It's a story about two sisters,"
Joy and Jill.
One was mousy her whole life because she was a mouse.
Ah!
"They're both mice, and the other mouse was always the beautiful one."
"Right, but then, they switched."
Sounds interesting.
"You know, mice do well in focus groups."
Melanie and I are artists.
We don't cater to focus groups.
And how does your story end?
"Well, what kind of endings do focus groups like?"
The kind that are in my hand by Monday.
Then you will have it by Sunday.
What is wrong with you?
I'm ready.
How do I look?
"Those are my orders, I can't stand hooligans."
You've come at a good time.
It's about the meeting.
"I told the boss, he wants us to follow procedure."
"You know what to do, so get over there."
What are you doing here?
"Take the kids, quick!"
"Come here, Naou."
"Wait here, I'll be back in a while."
"Good day, Touré."
How are you?
And the family?
"Today I've come to thank you, for the work you did with my wife."
It was a complete success.
My wife adores me.
And all thanks to God and your work.
- I thank you.
- Give thanks to God!
To his Grace!
"Today, my main concern in this visit... is the factory."
"In these violent times, it's enough to wear a new shirt... to awaken envy, even if the person... is not concerned."
I come to you for protection.
I've told you Traoré is evil.
"And now the workers have stopped working, to go to the meeting."
Who could have lightened the work load?
It's the new engineer.
He's reduced the cloth price.
"And when such a person calls a meeting, to discuss our problems, I think it's... something good, that we should... all value."
What do you say?
You're right.
"Our union delegates are a bunch of stool-pigeons, trust them... and you'll bury yourself alive."
So let's fire them!
Right.
We were sort of dating on and off then I found out that he got this super model pregnant.
I didn't even want to come out tonight and I ran into them.
"And I just, I don't know I just can't hit the Hollywood scene anymore."
It's just... not for me.
Wow I didn't even know you were dating anyone.
I thought you were...
I thought you were single.
Well slightly single.
I mean it was never anything fully committed.
Well breakups are always pretty tough.
I just don't get this town?
"Everyone is always on the search for the bigger, better deal."
It's just...
Yeah but you know it's all about hype right?
"I mean at the end of the day that's all it is, is hype."
Well yeah but it's different when you're famous.
You're part of the something better that people are searching for.
I am the exact same person that I've always been.
I'm not in this business for the hype.
Hey ZACH!
Come here.
Am I going to be on the cover of a tabloid as your newest squeeze?
I think I can handle that.
I'm so sorry.
It's Ok I like a good head butt...
that was...
"I was, meant to kiss your cheek and..."
I am such an idiot.
He was clearly going for the lips.
OK well have a good night.
Thanks bye.
The part at the window that was my audition scene and I had freaked out.
It's scary.
"When you worked on a lot, that's when people are like, ""It's good."""
Then you do it and you're like...
"It's so great, though."
"It's such a sweet, sweet scene."
And I like what's going on with Jonny and Raf in the background there.
- I didn't see it.
- It's very sweet.
They're just kind of canoodling.
"That broccoli she just put in her mouth was saturated with, like, lard oil."
"- Oh, man."
- We were trying to...
"She was trying to pick the healthiest thing to eat off of there, but..."
"Yeah, it was pretty gross."
I feel bad.
Norah never had an orgasm.
I love that whole...
I love that whole shtick.
Norah never had an orgasm.
"See, look at this, I mean..."
We filmed about three minutes of them canoodling.
It was very sweet.
"I couldn't say ""cut"" because it was kind of adorable."
This is really cute too.
Was that a real couple?
- It's a couple of extras.
- A couple of extras.
They're good then.
I felt...
I felt really nervous doing this bit about orgasms.
"Didn't the guy there say something about getting, like, a pocket rocket?"
"Fat, wait for me in the car."
The good old ear test.
"How are you doing, son?"
"My fingers, my eyes can deceive me... but never my ears."
The fabrics speak to me.
I can't hear a thing.
I know.
That's why I didn't insist that you follow in my footsteps.
The fabrics tell you what type of clothes they want to be.
You'll never forgive me for not being able to listen to the fabrics.
Who am I to forgive anyone?
I don't defend universal truths.
I defend my own truths... but look where it's gotten me.
It's made you an extremely elegant old man.
What good is elegance... in these days of jeans and T-shirt?
Women don't look for elegance anymore.
They only look for money.
"Four wives... my mother in the '50s, yours in the '60s... another one in the '7 0s... and he ended up in trouble with this one in the '90s."
If Veronica ends up with this shop...
This place is my life.
"- We're going to win, right?"
- Yes.
What do you want?
No rush.
It's just that...
High quality.
It would make a nice suit if it weren't for the color.
"But Dad, my idea was to make a Campari-colored suit."
"If the cloth cries out to be a suit, it can make a nice suit... even if it was born Campari."
Excuse me.
May I help you?
"In English, please."
"It says here, ""Thomas Anthony Ballantine..."
"""is restored to the rank of citizen of Great Britain..."
"""and his duty to Her Majesty's service is over and done with."""
Try and keep me out of this.
"I'm saying goodbye, Bal, and I wish you luck in the tea business... and your matrimony both."
"Wait a minute, Mac."
Wait right here.
I have to talk to him.
- But he said you can't go.
- He'll change his mind.
- I won't let you go!
"- Darling, I have to go."
I owe it to Cutter.
- He's saved my life time and again.
- You don't love me.
Do you want me to go through life remembering that I ran out... on one of my two best friends?
"After what they did to Higginbotham, and dragging you up here again?"
That's just the way of showing their friendship.
"I hate the army, I'm through with it, but friendship, that's something else."
But we're wasting valuable time.
You have to understand.
I'll be right back.
- I want to talk to you.
- You?
I don't want to argue...
I'm going if I have to shoot you and go alone.
You know as well as I do why you can't go.
"If anything happens to you, I'd be in a fine mess."
Your girl would prefer charges.
- She wouldn't.
- I don't trust her.
There's only one way I'll risk it.
I'm ok.
"No, seriously, dude."
When did you learn?
I started taking lessons a while ago.
This and voice.
Voice?
"Yeah, you know, like singing lessons."
"Dude, if you tell any of the guys at the house, I swear to god, I'll kick your ass."
"Nah, your secret's safe with me."
- So sing something.
"- I don't know, dude."
"I never, like, really sang in front of anybody except my vocal coach and, like, my band."
You got a band?
"Yeah, yeah, a couple of N.Y.U.Music grad students i picked up."
"So if you got a band, you're probably pretty good by now, right?"
"Yeah, listen, you know, like sean's sleeping in the other room and he's got the flu and stuff."
"Oh, come on.See, now you're just making excuses."
"I mean, how are you going to sing to a stadium full of people if you can't even sing to me in this room?"
I guess you're right.
"I mean, there is this one tune I've kind of been working pretty hard on, like, that I wrote."
"Ok, so sing it."
"- All right, but my chord progression's--"
- Blah blah blah.
- Just get on with the freakin' thing.
"- All right, all right."
I'll--I'll do like a verse or something.
"* Nothing left to look at but what lies inside me, * * my first reality cannot take what lies ahead, * * clear the path of destination is what you once... *"
What?
That was good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
"Yeah, I mean, you know,"
Let's go back to the hospital.
"Since things went wrong at the hospital, this is a medical mistake."
"If we go to the hospital and talk to them, they'll switch you back."
What are you going to say?
Ah...
"This man is my fiance, but his body got switched with that guy."
So take responsibility and switch them back.
That's what you're going to say?
Fine.
"I'm sure I'll be told that I'm crazy, but they'll find a way to fix it."
That's right.
"We're going to be told we're crazy, and all 3 of us will get locked up."
"You, me and my body that's in the hospital are going to keep staying at the hospital."
"If you're going to go, go by yourself."
I don't like hospitals.
"Just because you don't like it, you think avoiding it is the best?"
-Don't act like a kid!
-I'm still a kid!
-I'm 18 years old!
-That's right.
And a kid needs to listen to the adult.
"-Let's go, Kang Gyung Joon."
-Don't treat me like a kid.
This face isn't a kid's face.
Are you trying to joke with me right now?
And you shouldn't act like a frustrating adult and try to push me!
Why can't you think to calmly listen about what happened from the one affected?
Fine.
Talk.
I...
And Seo Yoon Jae were in an accident.
"The moment that we were to die, our souls escaped the body."
"Yeah, I have your number all right, Crystal."
You call me when you're ready to discuss this.
I'm in town.
"Well, they tried, Will."
"Amy and Ty, they did their best."
You know what?
I think I'm just getting too old... for all this.
I'm sick and tired of fighting.
"Actually, no."
"Actually, what I'm sick and tired of is losing."
"Losing fights, losing them horses..."
There's not much left to lose anymore.
"- Nah, that's not true."
- Oh no?
"Well, what would you know about it?"
"Look, Sam doesn't come up here to see me no more."
Now Joanna's met this guy and she's taking off with him.
Lost my best friend this last winter.
"On top of everything else, my health is totally giving out."
Now it's my lungs and don't be telling Joanna.
"Look, you don't wanna lose anything else, then move!"
Go with her.
It seems pretty simple from where I'm standing.
"Oh, it seems pretty simple to Mr. High-and-mighty, does it?"
You're telling me to do something you'd never do yourself.
Am I right?
"Your wife travels, she moves around, but you're ""independent."" You don't gotta go nowhere."
It's a fancy way of saying that you're gonna stay put.
"People wanna see you, they gotta come where you're at."
You're not gonna move anywhere.
"So don't be giving me advice that you wouldn't take yourself, thank you."
"- Come on, will..."
And nocturnal.
And fly.
"Okay, I think we're getting into bat territory again, and I want to steer us away from that."
Like a bat.
"Bats are everywhere, so."
They're really not.
Let's stay on track.
We're just gonna talk about fears about the baby.
What about baby-- baby bats?
"We're not gonna go down the bat thing again this class, okay?"
"Well, as long as it's black, though."
"We're both black, so it's gonna be black."
- A black baby.
- It's gonna be black.
How many of you have even seen a bat?
In real life?
"Okay, there we go."
You can't really get away from bats.
"Let's just keep it on the discussion that we had going, which is: what your worries are about the baby."
"Uh, we're Jewish, but we were afraid that our baby's going to be, like, too Jewish?"
Yeah.
"Like, two sets of dishes Jewish."
"And mark my words, no child of mine is gonna (bleep) through a sheet, okay?"
- Uh...
- My biggest fear... is that our baby will want to participate in SantaCon.
That's where they dress up like Santa?
I-
- I won that.
A couple years ago.
"I have to say yes, fear of a shit baby in this day and age, it's a-- it's a valid concern."
Okay.
"Well, if we're really sharing things,"
I didn't really get a good look at them.
"Don't you lie to me, Charles."
We're gonna pull out of here and forget we even saw them.
"Betty, do you know how much I like you?"
"I remember, faintly."
"I found out you can't always do or say what you want to that is, unless your father lets you."
Rodney are you going through all your life only doing what your father lets you do?
"Only having the friends that he picks out for you wearing what he tells you to wear, thinking his thoughts?"
"Betty, I'm old enough, but he's a tough man to handle."
- You've got to do it someday.
"- Yeah, but how?"
I have a selfish idea.
It has to do with you and me.
It's...
It's called marriage.
Wouldn't that just bowl him over?
I'm sure it would.
And me too.
But don't think of doing it just to bowl him over.
You're the only girl I've ever wanted.
Rodney... .
"Rodney, not that way."
What good is life if I know I didn't have the guts to live it my way?
Rodney.
I've really loved you for such a long time.
It must take a lot of patience to make something so beautiful.
That's what they tell me.
- All gone.
- Thank you.
Naked as the day they were born.
Not a stitch on them.
Saw them with my own eyes.
"Heads or tails, it looks like you won."
It doesn't pay to split partners.
"Well, i suppose the drinks are on me."
"Come on, my little prune."
No.
Won't you join us?
I beg your pardon?
"I don't even know you, sir."
That's all right.
"None of the others do, either."
"I'm treating all new york tonight, just to teach myself a lesson."
"Come, dear."
No.
"I've learned, miss mansfield, that when a person wants to be a success, he can't dawdle around."
"You got to grab at every chance, use everybody you can to help you up that ladder."
"And the higher you go, the louder people will cheer for you."
"You think only in millions, don't you, mr."
Fisk?
"Yes, sirree."
Millions of everything.
"People, dollars, thrills."
"Every minute is a thrill for me, and i wouldn't give up one of my minutes for all the gold in the united states mint."
I bet it'll look prettier on you than it did in the jewelry store.
"Why, uh, don't you like it?"
Any woman would be crazy who didn't like it.
Mr. Fisk... i expect to be a great actress.
What do you expect me to be?
Whatever you want to be.
"This looks like money to you, doesn't it?"
It don't to me.
"You know, there are two sides to every dollar- a lot of fun making them, a lot of fun spending them."
I've got a lot of them.
"Today my father will buy me a bike, and it will be prettier than yours!"
A bike?
Skidders are more fun than bikes!
They're no fun!
I don't want that!
"If you behave like this, I will not buy anything for you."
And your mother?
She went to the market to buy something.
You are a liar.
And that face?
It doesn't frighten me!
"Then throw it in the trash, if you don't want it."
I got upset because he is too egoistic.
I'm upset because papa did not buy me a bike.
"Then you were wrong, papa."
"You're good boy, don't cry."
How was I wrong?
You did not have to lie to the boy.
You don't know how much I wanted that bicycle for my son!
"Papa, you are a liar!"
You should speak with the director.
"Although I was in the right, it's normal that he dismissed me."
Be content with the skidder.
Who needs a bicycle anyway?
I didn't think that I would have to work at such a humble job.
"But you have a job, that is better than nothing."
Though I received a master's degree now I can't find work in the lowliest job.
It's all my fault.
I feel it.
"How lucky are the children, they can cry when they want."
A bear escaped from its cage!
"Although it escaped, our life remains in the same rut."
You're not the only one who worries about a tsunami.
Why don't you come with us?
"We'll just hike the lower ridge, grab some lunch; it'll be fun."
"Because it'll be just like we're dating, but we're not,so,no."
"I like how you'll take me to your sister's wedding, but you won't go for a hike with me."
"I like how you'll live with me for three years, but you won't marry me."
"Oh,see?"
Hike's ruined.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
See you guys.
Later.
"Just so you know, when Elliott showed up,I think your mole moved."
"Seriously,it's like twitched a line bit."
Skin Nugget thinks Elliott's the one.
He doesn't want to be the one.
Hey.
"We didn't really get a chance to catch up the other night,so..."
"Is there something that you want from me,Bella?"
"I thought maybe we could grab a drink, but if you're not into it..."
"""Into it""?"
"Yeah,you know what?"
I could be into it.
I could also just... want revenge.
"You know,like,big, classic John Hughes cinematic movie revenge."
But you could also be into it?
See?
Like right there.
"I mean,just for,like,a nanosecond,"
"I'm thinking,wow,she is so adorable"
I want to just die.
And then I just want to throw eggs at you.
Wait...not even on Sunday?
Why take Sunday off?
You need money that bad?
"It's not about money, doc."
Let me explain.
The freelance industry is very tough.
"Whatever work comes in, we have to take it."
Or someone else will.
"And if I don't take the job, they won't hire me next month."
My calendar will be empty.
I'll be jobless.
Hire someone to help?
Get help.
Then they will call and give it to that person instead.
And the other thing is when they call they want me to do the job.
So I should be the one doing it.
Do you think your body will stop at just a rash?
It's just getting started.
F*ck you body.
Don't scratch.
Do you have a nickname?
Yoon.
Yoon.
I'm Imm.
"We're around the same age, so let's be friends."
"When I'm treating someone, I take it very seriously."
I think you also take things seriously too.
So we should be able to understand each other.
"Because when I treat someone and that patient doesn't get better, it's like I'm doing a bad job."
You know what I mean?
"You may wonder... why I ask you all kinds of personal questions that seem like none of my business, but... just trust me, I really do care."
Think of this as a partnership.
If you two are through making out...
"I'd like to see you in my office, please."
What have we got?
We got victim number 3 in Wisconsin.
He's hitting his stride now.
"Nina Getz, Valerie Wheaton, and now this."
Somebody's got to go to Milwaukee this afternoon... and tell them that we ain't got jack shit.
It sure as hell isn't going to be me.
Be sure and show 'em that drawing you got... from a blind witness.
You just keep pushing me.
"Hey, you need it!"
Then don't you just take me off... this fucking case right now.
"Oh, ho!"
"No way, Jose."
"You're going right down with me, asshole."
"Why don't you lighten up, lieutenant?"
"Stay out of this, Ridgely."
You two know more about this case than anybody.
"This guy's out there laughing at you, man."
He's beating you.
I want you to go out and shut the motherfucker down... 'cause you're not getting off the case.
You're going to retire on this one.
I'm going straight to Milwaukee.
I don't know when I'll be back.
I'll get you a ride from someone downstairs.
I got this fucking jagoff of a lieutenant... who's blaming me for the fucking murder.
Here for the murder?
They're all inside.
You live here?
I'm sorry.
Why do people say that?
Why don't they just say that it sucks shit your mom's dead?
"All right, Mov, thanks."
"Well, Mohadevan says it was some kind of insect venom although it's unlike anything she's ever seen."
It's a good thing you didn't get too much of that in you.
She said you should just keep taking the antihistamines for the next 24 hours and you should be fine.
That thing used me and my friend to get to you.
I almost got you killed.
You were right not to trust me.
"Hey, hey, hey, hey."
"No, that's not the point."
You did fine...
all right?
You have a little work to do on the whole trust thingy.
What do you think?
Is it me?
"You just rest, okay?"
"Just, take it easy."
So what the hell was this thing again?
A demon bug?
"It's actually the other way around, a bug demon."
"Well, I think you actually both might be right."
"You two, you're just like peas in a pod lately."
"Hey, you know what?"
I am so ready to take my pension and retire somewhere else sweetheart.
- What did it want?
- Apparently it wanted me.
It was killing those kids to draw me in.
"It's dead now, so you don't have to worry about that anymore."
Which means I am free to help you two find that vampire you're been looking for.
"Oh yeah, yeah, I figured it out all by myself."
I can do that.
I'm a private detective.
- NO!
"You didn't like the music, old polkas... lt was embarrassing that no one came for her."
"So I went with the girl... what's wrong with her, what is it about her?"
And what was I meant to do about it?
"I knew those boys, so I spoke to them."
"That was a disgrace, did she have to hear it?"
Tono had to shout out there:
Isn't your daughter dancing?
For ages I've been wondering whether to tell you.
I'm disgusted with life.
And you often don't seem to be a mother.
"- Heavens, how could you think that?"
- How could I think that?
"I can't see any love on your part, any feeling, it's all about money."
"You come home happy - l got that much there, I had a nice little job, I earned that much... I managed to get a bargain."
But you don't make anyone happy.
"Just money, money."
"Just money, money."
Because that's what I see.
How can you see it?
Who do you think I'm doing it for?
How can you say that to me?
I do it all for you.
You have no idea how it was for us.
I don't understand how you could say that to me.
Must it be money all the time?
"No dream, no ideal, how it could be."
You talk to me about ideals?
"Really, you see nothing but money."
D'you think I wasn't young?
Wasn't I eighteen once?
I was nineteen when I left school.
"I learned languages, I learned to play the piano, to have a good life."
"Ok, look, look."
"I'm just gonna leave, all right, Dale?"
As long as I'm here this is not gonna end well.
"Just leave, ok?"
I bet you wanted that to happen didn't you?
"I'm seriously not following you, Hallie."
You really need to calm down.
You put on this little whoa is me act.
But I'm not buying it.
"Just because you throw yourself at every guy that's famous who you think can get you somewhere, and who you think wants you..."
"and then shoots you down, you know what, don't take that out on me, ok?"
You play the victim thing really well.
But it's a load of crap.
Shut up.
"You're not my... friend, Dale."
You're just like every other two-faced girl in L.A.
You just play it better.
"Come on, you guys."
This is retarded.
"What, you're just gonna take her side?"
"I'm not taking anybody's side, ok?"
"Come on, Hallie, let's go."
Don't touch me.
Did that really just happen?
This week on Dirty Roomies...
Would you clean this up.
I can't live like this.
I made the mess.
I don't know why I have to clean it up.
You guys have sex.
We have to do a paper edit on these and get them to run it.
The producers want to see it by Friday.
I'm going into a new business.
Only this afternoon I made $200.
$200?
"Yes, that's why I was late for the wedding."
That makes it a little different.
I'm not consenting to your wedding... but I always admire any young man that can make money.
It shows character.
"- That's too kind of you, sir."
- Not at all.
Then Margaret and I can get married?
If you go to New York and work hard at your business... and if you are successful... you can come back here and ask me for my Margaret.
"Oh, Daddy."
And in all probability I'll be very happy to give her to you.
"Right, sir."
"Thank you, sir."
"John, dear."
"You'll come back soon, won't you?"
"That all depends upon the stakes, the stocks..."
"Goodbye, my son."
"Thank you, father-in-law."
I'll say goodbye again because we'll both be waiting for you.
"Hurry back, dear."
I feel that I'm a little to blame in this.
"You know, I didn't realize what a bright, upstanding young man you were."
"And I don't care how big the city, I feel confident... you're going to be successful."
"Thank you, sir."
"Lucky, couldn't I go with you?"
I'm afraid you'd try to be a good influence on me.
"No, honest I wouldn't."
I'm terrible bad when you get to know me.
Then I wouldn't want you to come with me.
"One to New York, please."
Always wrestling with that Carter boy.
"- I told her, she wouldn't listen..."
"- You low, miserable, crazy slime."
- Don't you go shoving...
- That's your child she's carrying.
- It ain't.
"- I can prove it, Lucas."
I've got enough proof on you to put you in jail for the rest of your life.
- I never touched her.
"- Here, sign that."
It's a statement of the facts.
Are you out of your mind?
I never touched her!
Maybe you'd like the police to sweat it out of you.
"I never touched her, and I ain't gonna sign nothing that said I did."
"If you don't want to sign this paper, that's up to you."
"Hey, doc... ."
"You know I couldn't do nothing as awful as that, don't you?"
I'm going back to my office.
I'm gonna start telephoning every father in Peyton Place.
You wouldn't.
"I don't know what they'll do, but I do know this:"
"You're the janitor in a school full of young girls and an hour from now, I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes."
Don't do it.
I wouldn't think of fooling around with any other girls.
"It was just Selena, doc."
"Well, there was something about her."
It was just Selena.
"Please, doc, don't."
There's only one thing that'll stop me.
You sign that.
"If I sign it, what are you gonna do with it?"
"My theory is that these creatures, aliens feed of people like we feed about other creatures, and that they need for substinance a substance similar to opiates, heroin is an opiate, so this one can hear for it but they found something better!"
That substance is produced in the brain during an orgasm and is similar in chemical structure to opiates.
It is the key to get this substance.
Why didn't he kill me?
Did you have an orgasm?
No!
"In the end, in the end..."
Where are you?
Why don't you come out?
Over there...
In the end.
In the end come on now.
We can be together now.
Come out!
You can feed on me if you want.
It's OK.
I don't mind.
Now you care for me.
We can be happy.
I wanna make love with you.
No!
You can't leave me.
Don't leave without me.
No!
No!
"Excuse me, I'm in a tremendous rush, I can't make any stop"
I've got to go strait to the penthouse.
"The penthouse, that's the same as the roof, that's where I'm going."
Looks like Adrian is having a party.
Adrian?
Who's Adrian?
This isn't the roof.
"We didn't know what it was, but people were terrified."
"Hurry, get in the house."
I went with some of the other men to investigate.
"We found the wreckage, a few wounded survivors."
We didn't know what they were.
We decided to take no chances.
"We slaughtered them, burned the bodies."
Wise decision.
"Unfortunately we didn't get them all, and although none of us saw it, evidently, one of them survived."
It took its first victim that very night.
"We tried to hunt it down, but we couldn't find it."
It's been out there ever since.
"It feeds three, four times a year."
Takes two or three people each time.
"Two years after the crash, it took my own son."
That's it?
"One wraith, in the forest?"
Yes.
I'll be done by morning.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
"We'll all go together, in the daylight."
You're really going to help us?
"Well, like the man said, it's just one wraith."
It'd be downright unneighborly if we didn't.
"In that case, drinks are on me."
"Uh, well, let's not forget the food."
What?
Is it true?
You're going to hunt the Daimos?
It looks that way.
"I heard it has two heads, and it can turn you to stone just by looking at you."
"Well, you heard wrong."
The questions that Professor Rahmi gave me for photocopying...
- Did you look at them?
"- Well, I did this time."
"So, you were just going to help yourself?"
"I couldn't say it, okay?"
I couldn't say it.
"Whatever, it doesn't matter."
Let's not talk about that now.
You are the only guy who's organized systematic on the clock.
"And we need you on this issue, okay?"
"Okay, but I'll only do the planning."
"I won't interfere with the rest, deal?"
Fine.
Are we going to rob Professor Fatma?
No way.
It's fine with me.
"You're the ones who are having difficulty in math, not me."
But it's the most problematic one for all of us.
I think it's ideal for a start.
"Sure, I think so too."
She irritates me anyway.
Let's just start from there.
How are we going to do this?
She was telling us to draw a trapezoid.
"Now, we'll make the best one."
Listen to me.
We'll steal the questions a day before the test.
"Professor Fatma has a bag with a code, right?"
She keeps all her files and grading books in that bag.
"The day before the test, our questions will be in that bag."
How are we going to find the password?
The code is with two digits.
I've got nothing on.
"In fact, I'm going back to the wharves."
"In fact, I'm going back to the wharves."
We don't need to know what the job is.
We don't need to know what the job is.
"In fact, we don't care, mate."
We don't.
"In fact, we don't care, mate."
We don't.
"But what you've got to remember, Ray, is nothing's changed."
"But what you've got to remember, Ray, is nothing's changed."
So if you want our tick of approval...
So if you want our tick of approval...
"Ray, you want our tick of approval, mate."
"Ray, you want our tick of approval, mate."
..we get a big drink out of it.
..we get a big drink out of it.
I didn't do hard time over there to come home and get butt-fucked.
I didn't do hard time over there to come home and get butt-fucked.
Yeah?
Yeah?
(INHALES DEEPLY)
(INHALES DEEPLY)
"OK, Ray."
"OK, Ray."
NARRATOR:
"Pit bulls, born and bred to fight,"
NARRATOR:
"Pit bulls, born and bred to fight, to sink their teeth in and hang on like grim death to sink their teeth in and hang on like grim death until the last drop of blood was spilt."
until the last drop of blood was spilt.
And pretty soon the blood would start flowing.
And pretty soon the blood would start flowing.
"But let's say, that this point here is your happy face after those spicy rice cakes."
And here is your nice face worrying about a sick friend.
And here is your face sitting on the toilet.
"If we connect these points, then, we get a shape like this, right?"
Yes.
"But this is something we are not used to, so it's hard to grasp."
"Anyhow, it would still be closer to the real thing than this triangle."
"So if we continue our efforts, we can overcome this stereotypical and evil image."
"We can break them, you know."
So we have to try to see these other points together as well.
You know what I'm saying?
You are amazing.
How did you come up with this?
This is how I'm fighting right now.
That's a really good way to look at it.
Think so?
You really are smart.
Hello?
"I'm sorry, but I'm the person you saw this morning."
I wasn't sure if it was okay to go up.
"Oh, yes."
But I think my wallet is in there.
I can't find it anywhere.
Could you please look for it?
I'm down here now at the front desk.
Wallet?
Where did you put it?
"Well, maybe on the table or the floor."
Or near the bed.
I have important things in there.
"Well, I already cleaned the room and didn't find anything."
Hold on.
- How?
- Go back to the wreck for some cable.
- You can't go back up there.
- I'll just have to.
Just sit here and shut up.
Can you do that?
- It'll be dark soon.
- You afraid of the dark?
I was thinking of you coming back down.
"Hey, kid..."
I'm sorry.
I'll get you down in the morning.
- Did it look like an airplane?
- Can't say for sure.
- What can you say for sure?
- It was a flash out the corner of my eye.
"It might have been wings, it might have been a couple of trees."
Could you have gone back to make sure?
It's pretty hard to tell one ridge from the other.
"Besides, I was running low on gas and worried about getting back myself."
- Show me on the map.
"- Well, that was the other problem."
My compass was messing up on me.
I didn't know where I was.
"Not until I saw the rail line running into Baker, somewhere around here."
You let your pilots fly without knowing where they are?
The wind blew me down there.
You can't always tell what the wind's going to do.
You're talking about hundreds of square miles - and suppose you were wrong?
You'd be responsible for sending everybody in the wrong direction.
You were right to report the sighting.
But you see the problems it caused.
Tell 'em who you are.
Wait. so if you're not gossip girl
You must know who she is.
No. i just hacked into her server over spring break.
I was bored.
And now we have access to every e-mail that gets sent to her.
I can't believe she gets
All these posts that she doesn't report.
No. no. boring.
Apparently you dye your hair.
Yeah we have this theory
That either she can't substantiate some of them...
Or she waits till the perfect moment for maximum damage.
I wish i could be more helpful.
No you--you have been so helpful.
Can i actually borrow you for a minute?
I'd like you to help me dig deeper.
Nothing in here's good enough to beat the new girl...
Except for this.
No way. would you really use that?
I-i don't think i can.
If you did you'd totally win.
"Yeah,and then i could abolish the monarchy forever."
You going to nate's party?
No. i thought vanessa and i would hit a movie instead.
And here we go. all right
It's your last party of high school.
Now i know you don't love your classmates
But you just shared four years with them. honor that.
And i suspect there may be a couple of people
"That you'd like to stay friends with,or at least one person."
Yeah. yeah serena said kinda the same thing.
Leave my house!
You either get dressed up and behave like you have some self respect you'd just leave!
"Steve, will you fix me a drink please?"
Sure.
Having a problem with the Neanderthal man back there?
Yeah.
"Relax, you're fabulous."
Don't make a penny of domestic quarrels.
What are you staring at big cock?
Sorry I wish I knew how to tell you...
"If you got something to say copper, just spit it out."
You are in a dangerous situation.
"Man, listen let me tell you something you guys won't catch me, man, never!"
And I don't understand why you're being so stupid copper to let me know what's coming down that's really dumb.
Copper?
"What does that mean, I can help you."
"Fuck off, get out of my way."
"You don't understand, I can help you."
Oh!
You're a rat man.
"You want me to put you on the take, so you'll let me know when your invasion come in?"
Invasion?
Yeah what do you know about the invasion?
"Oh, shut your face scab, I don't play it your way."
"Just forget it fuck off, man!"
I don't need you man!
Fuck off!
Still sitting in front of the mirror.
Adrian is here.
I didn't come here to see Adrian.
Well I don't have any dope for you.
You have to see her about that.
"No, that's the..."
"Actually, the one thing that we haven't done."
We haven't had sex since we've been here.
We've barely even touched each other.
"Now, Cynthia and I are in a terrible spot."
"I come to this island, I come to the program to get some answers, find out my animal spirit..."
Yeah.
Let me help you out on the whole animal spirit thing.
It's gonna be awesome!
It always is.
"It's like if you go to a tarot card reader for past lives, you're always something cool..."
Dave like a king or a gunfighter.
"No one ever finds out that they were, like, a shopkeeper or an asshole."
Is this hilarious to you?
'Cause it's not to me.
"Tell you what+ If I get kicked off this island, I'm gonna blame all of you."
And I can't believe I let the two of you derail me!
We derailed you?
That's correct.
"If you kept a closer eye on Trudy, she wouldn't have strayed so far from the pack, all right?"
"She's not a dog, Jason."
Yeah?
"Well, listen, she's been very selfish, hasn't been a very good teammate."
I can tell you that.
"No, no, no, no, no."
"Look, I made promises, I let her down."
You don't know the ins and outs of our relationship.
Is that what it is?
It's a relationship?
"It's been two weeks, okay?"
All right?
That's not a relationship.
"In a bar, in a hotel lobby, on a street corner..."
Or in my home?
I'm not going to let you make anything dirty out of this!
Then what do you call it?
I'm going to tell you a hard truth about yourself.
It isn't sex your afraid of.
It's love that you can't handle.
"And that's what you're offering me, with your hands all over me?"
"That's only one expression of it, backed up by many things."
I haven't asked for any of them.
You'd better understand what you're saying no to.
"When I take you in my arms, I'm committing myself to you all the way!"
"That means that I intend to worry about you, take care of you... and that's what I want back from you!"
"Without any reservations, or shame, or embarrassment!"
-Either you're up to that or not!
-I have my standards and my pride.
-Not enough.
"-You need someone to trust, to love."
"-No, I don't."
I don't!
-Just leave me alone.
"-I can, but I don't want to."
"Connie, let me help you."
I don't care if you hang back.
"If it takes time, I'll give all you need."
I can't!
The offer is always open.
I don't know if you'll take it up but... perhaps it will make you feel better knowing it's there.
Hello?
"Yes, Marion."
I don't believe it!
Are you positive?
"$2 million is the price, and they're worth 3."
I'll have to see my board of directors.
But i can't hold out much hope.
"I'm sorry, uncle daniel, but the deal fell through."
"They won't go a penny higher than $1,500,000."
It's downright sinful.
Let's draw up a contract.
"Oh, sit down right here, uncle daniel."
"Boys, i got it!"
"What, 500,000 for us?"
And out of the tightest pocketbook in new york.
And everybody is satisfied.
"Stonington gets their boats, drew makes a profit, and we're on the road to future glory!"
"What do we do to celebrate, jim?"
We're gonna have some fun.
Follow me.
I've been looking at that sign all day.
"""Mademoiselle fleurique and her dimpled darlings in playtime in paris."
"50 girls 50."""
"Say, i got to meet them 50 girls 50, and they got to meet me!"
I'll take fleurique.
You high-flyers can fight over the 50 girls 50.
"Hey, i got dibs on fleurique."
We better let her know we're coming.
Take all those flowers over to her.
"They worked with drew, maybe they'll be lucky with her."
"Oh, luke-stick a french flag in that flower boat."
"Ooh, la, la, la, la as we tour in gay paris 'cause it's gay and it's fun and it's done ooh, la, la"
"It's a naughty, naughty place but it's what we call chichi say it once, say it twice, and it's nice ooh, la, la"
"When you're walking in the dark in the so-romantic park and he steals a kiss or two just say ooh la, la, la, la, la, la it's naive and it's blase what it means i cannot say"
"but it's fun and it's done and it's gay ooh, la, la"
she's what i call a lalapalooza.
"Billy, did you steal something from the hotel?"
"Yeah, well, I wish I could tell you more, but that's all I know."
"Well, you helped a lot."
At least now I know when that outfit was in Gold mine Canyon.
"Yeah, that's good."
"Sheriff, I saw that RV today."
I know you did.
"Listen, I told him all about it already."
"No, you didn't."
"Sheriff,"
I stole something from that RV.
"And now I want to turn myself in, even if it means 99 years."
"Well, why don't you just give me back what you stole and maybe we can skip the 99 years."
"On the other hand, stealing is a pretty serious matter."
maybe you and me ought to have a little private talk about it.
"Sheriff, it's you and I, not you and me."
"Well, whatever."
"Listen, I want you to tell me everything you know about this medallion."
There was this man at the hotel.
He's a waiter.
He was wearing one just like it.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
"And by the van, there was this long old car with bullets in the front."
It was following us [stutters] and then I saw it there.
"Well, now that is something."
Will I be called as a witness in the trial?
"Well, it's a possibility."
"But right now, I want you to do me a favor, okay?"
I want you and your folks to go right on down there and have a real good time at that frontier town.
Will you do that?
How did you know we were going there?
Only with total devotion and love can something like this work.
If I don't have absolute trust in this person.
"And similarly if he doesn't have trust in me, his mistress."
He can't let go completely and can't serve me 100%.
It's a huge sign of trust.
Of course I'm aware that I'm responsible for everything here.
And that can only work if it's based on absolute love.
"Pig, come here."
Make sure you do a good job.
That's enough.
"Thank you, mistress."
I used to be in sales.
"But now, I don't know."
I don't like retail anymore.
You're expected to be.
"like, a machine."
You have to be friendly.
no matter how rude people are.
They can insult you and you go.
"""I don't need this, I don't have to take this."""
"And in sales, work hours keep getting longer."
I don't like that.
So I thought I'd look around and maybe change fields.
I realized I seem to really get along with prostitutes.
"Because, as funny as it may sound, they like me."
"I don't know why, but... with most of them I don't have to pay."
Which is of course very nice.
And I learned from a prostitute pretty much everything I know today to make other women happy.
"So, sit down."
"Yes, master."
"So, let me see."
It's a lovely view.
But no.
"I'm primitive, I don't understand a thing."
"You wanted to send her to the city, to school, to be our pride and joy."
This is your school!
This is your city!
This is now your pride and joy!
Fuck this life...
"Let life give her the blessing, she won't get it from me."
"Neither she, nor that bastard that grows inside her!"
BASED ON A TRUE STORY
"Hurry up, Miro, we're going!"
Miro is quick!
The St. Nicholas' Day tradition goes back to year 1113 AD.
We pick the oldest boat in town.
Ritual burning of the boat takes place on the hill in front of the church.
We do this to appease the god of the sea.
"We pray for the calm seas, full of fish."
It's an honour to carry the statue of St. Nicholas.
Local respectable men take turns in carrying the statue.
Everyone wants to be close and touch it.
Some say the island would bloom if the ferry to the city was more frequent.
"Or if there was a mobile phone signal, at least."
We could connect with the world.
"Unfortunately, to no avail."
"But, don't you worry."
Each one of us in our small town has a cell phone.
Not a single call has ever been made from here.
What can we do?
People want to be part of the world.
"Some day the signal will come to us, too."
"Move these two up there, I don't want to get dirty."
But I'm not sure what good would that bring.
I don't want any dope.
What do you want?
Entertain you.
"So, how do you expect to entertain me?"
"Well, men have always entertained women."
I'm gonna show you...the difference.
Between men and women.
Don't make me laugh.
I'm not gonna make you laugh.
I'm gonna make you come.
So what?
I can come with or without you.
"You think I can't get it up, hmm?"
"I don't care, I wanna fuck with someone else but not you."
Oh I thought you wished for a big hard man.
Seems to me that too many men today are telling me what I want.
What I'm wishing is that you would leave.
What are you gonna do if I stay call the cops?
They'd love the chance to make love with you.
You think that sexy become I'm turned on by that?
Make me sick you big junkie.
Fucking dyke.
You're just a dyke.
You're so attractive to me I'm just coming and coming.
Shut up cunt!
You're not coming yet!
I wanna fuck you till you know what it means.
Dyke!
"You sick pig, I don't need your cock or anything."
"You're nothing you're nobody, you're nothing you're nothing."
"Alright wore, I'm gonna be sorry."
"You're right, I'm a wore, allright you fuck me see cause it doesn't matter to me, cause you don't exist you're nothing you're nobody, you just don't exist you're just a fly."

A shot in the dark
A past lost in space And where do I start?
The past and the chase
You hunted me down
"Like a wolf, a predator"
I felt like a deer in the lights
"793 01:05:31,914 --&amp;gt; 01:05:34,521 No, no... my dad didn't let me give the money 794 01:05:34,600 --&amp;gt; 01:05:38,300 Which money?"
"- I will tell you, long story"
"795 01:05:39,800 --&amp;gt; 01:05:41,258 He must have been afraid.. 796 01:05:41,258 --&amp;gt; 01:05:45,600 Kenan won't stay in jail forever, he know , he is going to be out."
"797 01:05:45,800 --&amp;gt; 01:05:48,300 I have to see my brother."
"798 01:05:48,300 --&amp;gt; 01:05:52,800 Hello..."
Mira?...
Hello?
"799 01:05:52,900 --&amp;gt; 01:05:55,800 Which Mira?"

Hi
I am Roberto Toledo
I'm 19 years old.
I live in the city of Guanajuato.
In Mexico!
Guanajuato is north of Mexico City.
And it's a city of much culture and history.
This is my family.
"My Dad, Tomás"
He is a doctor.
Everyone says he's very serious.
"My mom, Berta who is in a travel agency here, en Guanajuato."
"My sister, Daniela."
"And Julio, my best friend."
"In this city, there's always many tourists."
"Last year, two North American tourists from San Antonio,"
Texas
"Good afternoon, and how can I help you?"
"Good afternoon, I am Carmen Toledo, and my daughter Linda."
"Venimos de San Antonio, Tejas."
"El Señor Balzar of the Agency ""Fuera"" spoke with you last week about making a reservation for us."
"Oh, yes of course."
Welcome to Guanajuato.
"I am Berta Toledo, at your service."
Pleased to meet you.
(Berta) Everything is ready.
I have a reservation for all of you in one of the best hotels.
I sure know that.
I would like to ask you something.
But tell the truth.
The whole truth.
What did you use before this performance?
"Rolls with meat pie,... and green tea."
Some meat pies are good dopes.
"All right, where's the talent?"
She has something strange...
"I don't think you had to use something, you're just that kind of type."
"You have no extreme talent, but you enjoy the singing, and I wanted to see it to the end."
A lot of energy comes out of her!
- Certainly!
"- It's strange, Paľo."
Yes for me!
- Strange.
- I felt good.
Something painful.
Mournful.
The singing grobian here just wants some notes...

Win Phippen:
Yes it is.
It's a quite a coup for the University.
Beth Seaton:
It is.
Win Phippen: ...and my research program.
I'm quite excited about it.
It's very unique.
"It's not a hard core, sort of, science research project."
"It's more plant-breeding education, and with a component of science related to it."
And the real neat thing about it is that is has
There are so many careless drivers in the world.

You used to call me
Just to say I love you baby
You would always treat me like a lady
Everyone was jealous of the way
"We kept keeping on, feelings were so strong"
Always knew that I would occupy your mind
You could always find a little more time
To show me I was number one
Sitting there on my throne
Lately where's the feeling gone
When it was good
We were sitting on top of the world
When it was good
No I never wanted nobody else
When it was right not like tonight
We were sitting on top of the world
When it was good
No we didn't have a cent to our name
When it was good

Now look here.
I am on this though.

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
"Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?"
"Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember"
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
If you eat too much ooh ooh
You'll awake with a tummy ache.
On the good ship lollipop
It's a night trip into bed you hop
And dream away
On the good ship lollipop.
On the good ship lollipop.
It's a sweet trip to a candy shop
Where bon-bons play
On the sunny beach of Peppermint Bay.
Lemonade stands everywhere.
Crackerjack bands fill the air.
And there you are
Happy landing on a chocolate bar.
See the sugar bowl do the tootsie roll
With the big bad devils food cake.
If you eat too much ooh ooh
You'll awake with a tummy ache.
On the good ship lollipop
It's a night trip into bed you hop
And dream away
On the good ship lollipop.
You'll awake with a tummy ache
On the good ship lollipop
It's a night trip into bed you hop
And dream away

Hello.
Today's recipe is an Sweet Popcorn.
"And to make this sweet Popcorn, the ingredients are:"
1/2 cup of water.
Again a pig?
No.
A lion.
No.
"I have to say it, it is a stupid, racist sentence, but it is also true:"
Somali people are always shouting.
It is always the real big drama.
This was a german Reunification-Shout.
This was a Bone-Breaking-Shout.
I can't bare certain pictures.
"When I see a cruel picture, a bloody picture,"
I loose consciousness a fall to the ground.
This happend for the last time in Berlin in the subway.
There are screens called Berliner Fenster.
"They showed an advertisment for a CD recorded by the German Opera, Semiramide by Rossini."
Then they showed a photo from Pulitzer Awards.
It was taken in the National Theatre in Mogadishu.
You see a man lying on the ground with summer clothing.
"The sun is shining, he smiles."
"There is a hole in his head, there's blood and parts of his brain everywhere."
When I saw this I fainted.
Oh God!
I worked with cruel pictures as well.
A serbian colleague asked me to participate in her performance.
She experienced the Kosovo-war when she was 15.
She described a footage that she saw.
That was broadcasted in the TV.
A prisoner was tied to a column.
His skull was cut open alive.
And the liquid from his brain was spooned out.
I shoul dance a derwish-dance.
That's a prayer of turkish monks.
I'll bet we could really swing down there.
Just the three of us.
You and me... and all that money.

"No matter who looks at it, it is obvious that it is fake."
It is not fake!
I took it personally!
You went to Playground (Bar) yesterday.

"- We felt hat if there was a dot-EU, we should clearly be part of it. - .eu Is used because it is a European congress."
- Europe has become an open space in many ways.
"- We are in the European Union, ... yes?"
"Why not use .eu, we are European."
"- In Portuguese, EU spelled e-u, means ""I""."
"- I would say that we are a Portuguese company, but we are also a European company."

THE ELUSlVE AVENGERS
"Based on "" Little Red Devils ""  by P. Blyakhin"
Screenplay by Sergey YERMOLlNSKY Edmond KEOSAYAN
-Soft taco.
-[Elmo voice]:
Soft taco.
With sour cream and a Pepsi.
"-I want a chalupa, with no lettuce or tomato."
-A little chalupa.
No lettuce or tomato
And I need a number nine again with no sour cream.
"-Yeah, well, that's not a bad Elmo impression."
"Yeah, the video's funny, it's a decent prank I admit it."
"The video's now at over a 100,000 views and it's gaining fast."
"But you know, my question is, what the f--k is Elmo doing at Taco Bell?"
"I always just assumed that Elmo was on a strict diet of, you know, sunshine and unicorn meat."
"But no, he apparently eats the sh--ty Mexican food that even real Mexicans don't even eat."
"Now if you listen closely at the end of the video, you can actually hear the cashier laughing."
-Elmo needs lemonade.
-Lemonade?
"-Yes, ma'am."
-[laughs]
-Let's be honest.
The cashier finds it funny.
She's probably high too.
You know this is probably the best thing to happen to a Taco Bell worker since that f--king chihuahua died.
"Yeah, I do have one criticism though."
"You know, Elmo's a Muppet and it would've been ten times funnier if another Muppet had answered back like,"
"""Uh, this is Kermit the Frog here and you need to take your punk-ass back to Burger King."""
"Or, if Liza Minnelli worked there and was suddenly like,"
-Balls to you!
-But I didn't order any balls.
"Well, you're getting 'em."
But you know what probably did order balls?
"The comment question of the day, which comes from a user named, bam!, and he said..."
The dad.
Good question.
What about the dad?
[ Silence ]
[ Inaudible ]
"Oh, come on."
I don't have to do all the talking.
Who would be-- who was the dad?
Something to do with the dad.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Maybe the baby was illegitimate. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Bingo.
Okay.
"So if the baby's illegitimate, who would the dad be?"
"And who would be mad at Lucy for having the baby with the dad? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; The wife [inaudible] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; The wife of the father, exactly."
Okay.
"So Lucy wasn't married, and the baby wasn't legitimate, and I went with her that day."
She-- we went and confronted the wife schoolteacher who happened to be the father of the baby.
"So Lucy took the baby; we walked to the other end of the village and she said, listen, I had this baby."
Your husband is the father.
We had an affair.
The affair is over.
I don't want him anymore.
"You know, the baby is an innocent."
So let's please all just get along.
And then she went back.
Did the baby get conjunctivitis anymore? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; No.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No.
Absolutely.
That was not a very serious illness.
But Ferdinand's was.
"He first had minor aches and pains, turned into a fever, got steadily worse, and into the second week he couldn't stand up."
The family was searching frantically for the witch that was causing his illness.
They were trying witch after possible witch after possible witch after possible witch.
Wave to each other.
How many work with young people outside of school settings?
"Ah, yes, wave to each other."
How many would like to be working with young people?
(Laughter) Alright.
How many of you are parents?
Look at that.
"Alright, I work with young people who have dropped out of the school systems."
"People from low income background,  ages 16 to 24."
"And what they say to us in the Youth Build program as they come into, is,"
"""They didn't care about us in school."
"Nobody cared about me."""
"So, I just want to say, from all  of young people in Youth Build, tens of thousand have been in Youth Build, who have experienced good teachers as I think most of you probably are."
I know that you've started-
"Jon, your blessing to them was very appropriate- you started your career because you want to make a difference, I know that."
"From all the young people in Youth Build who know the teaching makes a difference,"
"I am standing for them to say thank you  very much, it does make a difference."
I am bringing some voices of some young people I work with.
"There are 3.5 million young people  who are between ages 16 to 24, who are out of school, out of work and raised in lower income communities."
"Here is one of them, Mike Dean."
"Well, so much for order."
(Laugh)
I am OK.
(Laughter)
Mike's is in here somewhere.
Staplers are very useful.
(Laughter)
Mike says:
"""I've never had an easy year growing up in Columbus, Ohio."
I lived in a drug-infested home  without a father.
My neighborhood was drown  in confusion and negativity.
The lack of positive goals and dreams led me to a life of crime.
Which is it?
"Please stop asking me this, I..."
"Well, just tell me what you really think."
"No, that's okay..."
Tell me.
No... it's fine...
Tell me!
I... like it...
"Tell me, tell me, tellmetellmetellme!"
All right!
Since you really wanna know...
"The arm's sized tight, the middy collar doesn't go with the shawl lapel... ...the hems are clearly machine-stitched, the pleats are uneven, the fabric looks like toile... ...you used a backstitch here when it clearly called for a topstitch or maybe a traditional blanket stitch... ...and the overdesign is reminiscent of prêt-à-porter and not true French haute couture."
"But, uh... you know... um, whatever you want to do is fine."
"Now, the stars on my belt need to be technically accurate."
"Orion has three stars on his belt, not four."
"Stitch by stitch, stitching it together"
Deadline looms Don't know the client's always right?
Even if my fabric choice was perfect

Farmer Lloyd Olsen is having chicken for dinner.
He selects a five-month-old rooster called Mike.
The headless chicken carried on as though nothing had happened.
A blood clot prevented him from bleeding to death.
"Mike's head was gone, but most of the brain stem and one ear was intact."
And a brain stem provides all the thinking power a chicken needs to survive.
Mike the headless chicken became famous.
Feeding was a problem.
Farmer Lloyd dropped water and grain down what was left of Mike's gullet.
Mike not only survived-- he thrived.
Mike the chicken struts into number 4 because he lived for 18 months without a head.
"Unfortunately, Mike had a mucus problem and needed an eyedropper to clear his airways."
"One day, Lloyd couldn't get to the eyedropper fast enough... and his headless chicken died."
But Mike's legend lives on.
The animals crawling into number 3 thrive in the underworld.
Rats.
We think they're dirty.
Disgusting.
Diseased.
"-	If they can that would be huge, but the Infestors are waiting below."
"Umm, viOLet is too good for that!"
He is not going to let that happen.
"-	Yeah, I think viOLet has actually done this, he's gonna kill the last Orbital, and with that, Polt is just going to run around the map with these Marines."
-	He is trying to get Vikings though..
But again he is supply blocked.
-	He can't build anything.
"He's got no supply, he's got like two Depots in the back of his natural, and that's..."
Just about it!
Is there a Command Center floating somewhere?
"-	There is a Command Center being built in the middle-right hand side of the map, but will viOLet see that?"
"-	Yeah, there is no Orbital, so viOLet can just burrow Drones right next to extractors."
"-	Wait, where is viOLet's last building?"
Where is it?
-	Oh My God!
-	Ohh!
"Another Yamato gets planted, and now we start to see the Yamato's incoming for Rain."
Oh no!
BoxeR loses the Ghost!
No EMP's possible now.
And there are the Yamato's going down.
He is picking off one Viking at a time.
He needs to avoid those Seeker Missiles.
"Huge number of Point Defense Drones, a very tense micro situation."
"Now we see the big engagement, this could be the final battle."
"The Ravens on the wrong side, trying to move forward, if he can get a big.."
"Ohh, big Seeker Missile could go off, but no!"
They are all out of energy.
"And it looks like in terms of the air battle, we do see 31 Vikings, more are falling for BoxeR, can he pick off all of the Battlecruisers?"
"And it looks like BoxeR might come out on top in the sky, but the seven Thors from Rain give him the victory there!"
"-	There are still 66 Probes up for HerO, so his economy is still fine."
"-	Yeah, wow."
"And this holiday season, let us reaffirm our commitment to each other, as family members, as neighbors, as Americans, regardless of our color or creed or faith."
"Let us remember that we are one, and we are a family."
"So on behalf of Malia and Sasha and Michelle and our grandmother-in-chief, Marian -- (laughter)"
"-- I wish you all the happiest holiday season, the merriest of Christmases."
"God bless you all, and may God bless the United States of America."
(applause)
"And with that, I'm going to invite the entire Obama clan up here to light the Christmas tree."
"I need some help, and there's a lot of technical aspects to this."
(laughter)
"Come on, guys."
(applause)
All right.
"Okay, we're going to start counting down here."
We've got the switch right here.
The First Lady:
"All right, come on."
The President:
Everybody ready?
And this is the new tree.
"I know it's not quite as big as the old tree, but it's going to take time to grow."
But we're going to fill it up with some spirit and start a new tradition right now.
"All right, everybody ready?"
We're going to start counting down.
"Five, four, three, two, one -- (applause)"
There you go.
That's a good-looking tree.
"Thank you, everyone."
Now I have come to the crossroads in my life
I always knew what the right path was.
"Without exception, I knew."
But I never took it.
You know why?
On edge.
"Frustrated, 'cause I was like, ""Where is the paper?"""
I was pretty creeped out.
"Very, very scared."
Scared.
How else would I feel?
Am I supposed to be happy or something?
The sounds they had
I didn't think were going to affect me as much as they did.
"Just, ""Boom."""
Just constant bass is just nerve-racking.
"(Finebros) So, the villain in the game is called Slender Man, which is an Internet meme that's been around for a while that some people have even started to like to say is real."
"Oh, my gosh."
(Finebros) And people will post pictures of sightings of the Slender Man.
Someone just walked by.
"(chuckling) Oh, my god."
(Finebros) What have you seen?
What do you know about the Slender Man mythology or whatever?
"It was like some mythological creature, and it was like this man who's really tall with a suit and everything and no face."
He was there before mankind.
"He kidnapped children and whatnot, and there's, like, several accounts of it too."
"Like, there was this picture--"
"Oh, God, I just got chills from it."
I don't like it.
There's this picture of a park and there's a bunch of kids.
"In the picture, he has four or five arms, and the kids in the picture later on went missing."
Those are just Photoshopped.
I've seen those pictures.
Photoshop.
"Oh, my God."
(Finebros) What is it about the Slender Man that is making people care so much that they're creating so much content about him?
He's scary and people seem to like being scared.
"- Oh, God!"
He's right there!
- (chuckles)
"- (laughs and curses) - Oh, he has tentacles!"
Oh!
I never saw that before.
What?
Poor guy.
(Finebros) Why are people uploading videos of themselves getting scared?
"Uh, 'cause it's hilarious."
All YouTube videos-- the reason they upload it is to get views.
"(Finebros) Do you think that everyone was being legit scared, or were some of them pretending to be scared?"
"I feel like a lot of them were exaggerating,"
"'cause if they were videotaping themselves, they knew what was happening."
"Tobuscus, I felt the after part was a little overdone."
But I bet you most of the people are legitimately scared.
"(Finebros) So, this game is a fairly simple game and there's not much to it and it's short, but it's so popular."
"Why do people love playing ""Slender""?"
"I didn't love playing ""Slender."""
"I don't know why people love playing ""Slender."""
"Because it's so hard to win and it's so fun to play because of the suspense, I guess."
"There's not a whole lot to do with it, so, like, anyone can play it."
"The simplicity of it could, like, attract them."
It attracts a lot of people that maybe aren't into gaming that--
- (cracks up) - (Finebros) There's nothing there!
"People like to be scared, you know?"
People like to have that adrenaline rush.
I don't do well with scary movies.
"I got nightmares from ""Harry Potter."""
"(Finebros) And what advice would you give to somebody who is about to play ""Slender"" for the first time?"
Just don't do it.
Just don't.
[laughter]
"Um, listen, you two are going to fight like hooded roosters."
Let's just get it out there.
It's science.
"You know, place any two animals in a contained area together, um, you know, there will be awesome tenderness, but also there will be blood."
[laughter]
Tristam:
That is my pocket Walt Whitman.
"He was surely one of the greatest poets that ever lived, and if my babies can read Walt Whitman day and night and learn from him, I'll be very happy."
"After all, babies, he did say,"
"""I am August."
"I do not trouble my soul to vindicate itself."""
"No, he didn't say ""soul."""
"He said, ""I do not trouble..."" woman:"
"That's enough, Tristam, you'll use up all the memory."
"This is self-indulgent, and-- Please stop."
They need winding.
"Please stop, Tristam."
Tristam:
"""I do not trouble my spirit..."" woman:"
Stop being so selfish and putting yourself first.
"Please, I've been looking after them all day."
Just stop it.
Tristam:
"""I do not trouble my soul to--"
"""I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood."" woman:"
"Okay, fine. man:"
Ann and John are today renewing their vows in the light of their 50 years experience of marriage.
"Rather unusually, each of this special couple has agreed to write the vows of the other."
"That is, Ann has written John's vows, and John has written Ann's. man speaking native language:"
"Pull, pull. woman speaking native language:"
This one doesn't lift me up.
What if I told you that I wasn't getting older ... but I was getting younger than everybody else?
I was born with some form of disease.
Voice:
What kind of disease?
BP:
I was born old.
Man:
I'm sorry.
BP:
No need to be.
There's nothing wrong with old age.
Girl:
Are you sick?
BP:
"I heard momma and Tizzy whisper, and they said I was gonna die soon."
But ... maybe not.
Girl:
You're different than anybody I've ever met.
BB:
"There were many changes ... some you could see, some you couldn't."
"Hair started growing in all sorts of places, along with other things."
"I felt pretty good, considering."
Ed Ulbrich:
"That was a clip from ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."""
"Many of you, maybe you've seen it or you've heard of the story, but what you might not know is that for nearly the first hour of the film, the main character, Benjamin Button, who's played by Brad Pitt, is completely computer-generated from the neck up."
"Now, there's no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of Brad superimposed over another actor's body."
We've created a completely digital human head.
So I'd like to start with a little bit of history on the project.
This is based on an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story.
It's about a man who's born old and lives his life in reverse.
"Now, this movie has floated around Hollywood for well over half a century, and we first got involved with the project in the early '90s, with Ron Howard as the director."
We took a lot of meetings and we seriously considered it.
Please....
"Okay, here's the deal."
I have an explanation for### this picture
I'm gonna back it up as soon as this hooker comes in here and tells you she's not with the mayor last night
Having the police pick her up right now.
On what charge?
"I don't know, James."
Let's keep our fingers crossed and hope she does soemthing illegal while she's trying to get people to pay her to have sex
Don't bother Mike
I already talked to her.
"And she 's already writing a book detailing### her 5 year-relationship with the mayor, sorry buddy"
"Carter, do something"
"So, we still on### for tonight?"
"She's lying, Jason."
How could you possibly know that?
Do you have some kind of alibi?
No.
I don't
Mike's mom is the perfect alibi
Should I go remind him?
Only if you're bucking#### for a promotion.
Wait a minute.
So close!
"Under three, high twos."
I had a two hour and fifty-something.
Thanks for coming!
"As Gerry said, I tried to avoid giving  this talk, but couldn't get out of it."
I came here to tell you that  I organize TEDx events.
I have three under my belt and  a fourth is due in a couple of months.
"And I do it because my Mom  inspired me to do so as her father inspired her,  to do things wholeheartedly."
"Well, it turns out that it's been  a year since she passed away."
"She had been struggling  with cancer for two years and she had a stroke three days  before my last event, which left her quadriplegic  and unable to speak or move."
And if I'm offered to drive in a
Ferrari I don't ask questions.
I just drive it.
The problem with this situation is that I'm now at
least a year late to reviewing the Spider.
You've all read about it and watched the video so you need to see something different.
"Now I've searched YouTube and there are lots of beautiful shoots and factual films, but there isn't much bad behavior."
"I've, therefore, decided in the interest of original programming that I'm going to drive this car"
like a complete idiot.

[CAR ENGlNE]
"Well, I have to say, it's dead impressive for a car with a conventional construction that's got no roof."
"570 horsepower, at about 1550 kilograms, at"
"little bit less, actually."
It's just as fast as you ever wanted a car to be.
Very direct steering.
I've got the suspension in full firm at the moment.
But I might just try and soften it off a bit and see what it does.
[TlRES SQUEALlNG]
It might make the car a bit lazier.
[CAR ENGlNE]
I hope you can get some of this noise.
Because it's--
[CAR ENGlNE]
That's the defining aspect of the 458.
It's normally aspirated.
It makes a noise that the McLaren just can't hope to match.
[CAR ENGlNE]
The problem with these flippin' Spiders these days is they kind of undo my argument that you have to have a hard top on the driving front.
But that was some of the stuff.
"There's a lot of routine stuff, a lot of fun."
Different countries.
50-something countries I got into.
"You can see just, some of them listed and..."
"Bangkok, Tokyo, got all that stuff over there in Vietnam"
Different things.
Fun.
I almost stayed in but there were some conflicts and I didn't...
Conflicts with - ?
"At home here, little things were going on."
"If I had stayed in, at Staff Sergeant, I had orders direct from headquarters from Air Force by name."
They were going to ship the first squad of 130s over to Vietnam.
And I was the instructor.
"And there was another guy who just - he had probably 5 or 6 years, he was just a little more than me, and he would have been the NCOlC in charge, and I would have been in charge of instructing and creating the instructions."
"As soon as I put my foot there, the job called for"
"Master Sergeants, both jobs."
"And the Air Force can fill them with one rank less, if they didn't have a Master"
Sergeant.
"So they guaranteed me Tech Sergeant, so I would have been in the Air Force four and a half years, and would have been Tech"
Sergeant.
"And, hell, this guy was retired with that."
"But, maybe I wouldn't have come out of Vietnam either."
But that wasn't the reason I got out.
Different things were going on at the time.
So about what year did you get out?
The end of '64.
The end of August.
I was just in for four years.
Two thousand hours flying time and another... other airplanes too.
"When you got out, where did you come to?"
I went to Grand Rapids and stayed with one of my sisters.
"Btw, another great medicine that reduces inflammation is aspirin."
S:
"Aspirin, I've heard of that!"
Dr:
It's a helluva drug!
"Again, there are side effects to aspirin, it can effect bleeding, but at the same time, it gives dramatic effect by lowering inflammation."
S:
Right.
"And that is the main side effect, it's an age-old drug, and it's a blood thinner, if you get a cut or you bleed while taking aspirin, you might bleed more."
Dr:
Right.
"Blood thinner is a funny word, I'm not sure what it means."
I keep thinking paint thinner when you say that.
S:
That's how I imagine it.
Dr:
"It binds to the platelets and blocks them from activating, it stops them from working very well."
S:
It's more anti-clotting?
Dr:
Right.
"And platelets are one of the key components in clotting, and they certainly affect it."
S:
"So your blood will have the same viscosity, it just won't clot as easily."
Dr:
Exactly.
And you could certainly paint a wall with either one.
S:
That's a little morbid.
Thanks so much
"For one of these things to be in the return value, two things have to be true."
"First, it has to actually match this regular expression."
Which is good today and good tomorrow.
Dr:
"Yes, it lowers heart disease and cancer down the road."
S:
I had no clue.
I thought the flu shot was just a nice thing to avoid a week of the sneezing.
But flu shot can actually reduce your cancer...
Dr: ...and heart disease down the road.
And we have to think long-term as a society.
S:
What about statins?
"I mean, it seems things like Lipitor, etc.--"
"no one should take medical advice based on a thing in a video-- but, are taking it, just for heart disease?"
Or are people taking it more broadly now?
Dr:
Listen:
"I'm a believer that these drugs have such a profound affect on cancer, heart disease, stroke, potentially Alzheimer's, that you should consider taking it to prevent these diseases."
"And again, giving no recommendations, but what I say is, you and parents should talk to your doctor and say,"
"""Why shouldn't I be on this drug?	"""
S:
And there are some side effects?
Are they easy to test for?
Dr:
"They test for them, and they're reversible."
You have to do a risk-benefit analysis.
"Have to look at you and say, are you at high risk for XYZ?"
"If you are, what can prevent it or delay it?"
"The name of the game is not treating disease, it's preventing disease."
S:
This is fascinating.
"But no advice here, everyone should talk to their doctor."
Dr:
You divide by something is the same thing as multiplying by its inverse.
So I'm multiplying by the inverse of 1/4.
"So this is going to be equal to-- well, we could divide the numerator and denominator by 2, so the 4 becomes a 2, the 2 becomes a 1."
"5 times 2 is 10/1, So it's just 10."
Part B.
Or let me do every other one.
C. 5/11 divided by 6/7.
"Once again, this is the same thing as 5/11 times the inverse of 6/7, so times 7/6."
"And so we get, this is 5 times 7 is 35 over 66."
And that's in lowest common form or simplified form.
So E.
Let's do E.
"E, we have negative x over 2 divided by 5 over 7."
"Once again, this is the same thing as negative x over 2 times 7/5, which is equal to negative 7x over 10."
Think you're getting the hang of it.
Let's do part G here.
We have a negative 1/3 divided by negative 3/5.
"Well, this is going to be the same thing as negative 1/3 times the inverse of this, times negative 5/3."
I just swapped the numerator and the denominator.
So this is going to be equal to-- the negatives cancel out.
A negative times a negative is a positive.
1 times 5 is 5.
3 times 3 is 9.
Let's do one more.
Let's do I.
Part I. 11 divided by negative x/4.
"Once again, this is the same thing as 11 times the inverse of this."
"The multiplicative inverse of it, times negative 4/x."
"And if this confuses you-- actually, I shouldn't write multiplying."
That looks just like an x.
I should say this the same thing as 11 times negative 4/x.
"Or you could view this as 11 over 1 times-- you could even view it as negative 4/x, which is equal to minus 44/x, or negative 44/x."
I sat up till after midnight studying *The Roman Ritual*... ...thinking about what lay ahead.
You mean *The Roman Ritual* *of Exorcism*.
A text used by Catholic priests... ...as a guide to performing the exorcism rite.
"Yes, I think I actually fell asleep with the book in my hand."
What happened next?
"*I woke up, freezing. *"
*It was exactly 3 a. m.*
Three a. m. is the demonic witching hour.
It's a way for demons to mock the Holy Trinity.
"It's an inversion of 3 p. m., the miracle hour... ...which is traditionally accepted as the hour of Christ's death."
I thought I smelled something burning.
*Only later did I connect it... *
*... and I remembered that that same* *smell of something burning... *
*... had been perceived by Emily. *
"Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and..."
"Pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our..."
At the hour of...
"What do you make of this gesture, this nod in your direction?"
I don't know.
"Some kind of acknowledgment, I guess."
That the game is on.
"You're really God's gunslinger, aren't you, Father?"
Standing tall and facing the devil with your prayer book at your side.
"Objection, Your Honor."
Counsel's harassing my witness.
Sustained.
"Mr. Thomas, you know I won't allow that in my courtroom."
"Forgive me, Your Honor."
"Father, did you understand this black-robed figure to be the devil?"
I believe it was a demonic manifestation.
Like the demonic force you believe possessed Emily?
- Yes.
And then decide what you want to do.
*I saw your eyes today in court when* *I explained the significance of 3 a. m.*
*It's not going to stop* *until Emily's story is told. *
Are you gonna make a statement?
Do you believe it was the devil?
Is the defense ready to proceed?
"Yes, Your Honor."
The defense recalls Father Richard Moore.
The witness is reminded that he is still under oath.
- When did you last see Emily alive?
- The night before she died.
"Her mother, Maria, called me and said that Emily had asked for me."
- Why did she ask to see you?
- To give me this.
Did Emily explain to you the letter's significance?
Yes.
She said she'd written it the morning after the failed exorcism... ...and that it was important for me to share.
"Father Moore, was Emily a good person?"
I believe that one day Emily will be recognized as a saint.
- So she loved God.
- Yes.
She was very devout.
"Father Moore, if Emily loved God... ...if she was so good and so devout, why do you think God... ...allowed this to happen?"
- Objection.
What is the relevance of that question?
Father Moore's belief in this matter is crucial... ...in establishing his and Emily's understanding of her condition.
"And that mutual understanding is paramount in determining... ...whether Father Moore was, in fact, negligent."
I'm going to allow it.
"Your Honor, you're not really gonna let someone testify... ...about why God would allow the death of a young girl?"
The objection has been overruled.
"Again, Father Moore:"
Why did God allow Emily to become possessed by demons and then die?
I'm trying to do better.
"Being brillians not enough, young man."
You have to work hard.
"Intelligence is not a privilege, is a gift."
And you use it for the good of mankind.
You want to try it back there?
So is that it?
Yes.
My design to initiate and sustain fusion.
I understand you use harmonics of atomic frequencies.
Sympathetic frequencies.
Harmonic reinforcement?
Go on.
An exponential increase in energy output.
A huge amount of energy.
Like a perpetual sun providing renewable power for the whole world.
Are you sure you could stabilize the fusion reaction?
"Peter, what have we been talking about for the last hour and a half?"
This is my life's work.
I certainly know the consequences of the slightest miscalculation.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to question you.
"Rosie, our new friend thinks I'm gonna blow up the city."
You can sleep soundly tonight.
Otto's done his homework.
"Come to the demonstration tomorrow, and you'll see for yourself."
"And you need to sleep soundly tonight, Otto."
Did Edison sleep before he turned on the light?
Did Marconi sleep before he turned on the radio?
Did Beethoven sleep before he wrote the 5th?
Did Bernoulli sleep before he found the curves of quickest descent?
"Rosie, I love this boy."
Real stories.
You married the whiny bitch.
"Well, we made them up but they'll remind you of folks you know."

He's got a good job.
He worked a couple different jobs but he's working with ACI now.

He trucks them all around.
"My daughter, she's an airplane mechanic."
Civilian mechanic for the National Guard in
North Carolina.
But she had to join the Guard to do it.
And she picked up her pilot's license in high school.
Her AMV license at Western.
And went to Alaska and worked on float planes.
DC6s.
"First year there, she got laid off"
She was the head mechanic of the car wash.
"Next year, when she got laid off she went and flew in the - worked mechanic for these"
DC6s at Air Alaska or something like that.
The guy got a 4-engine piston plane.
He flies down to Kodiak and around there.

He found out that she had a pilot's license but also the engineer thing.
So there was a panel that - she was an engineer not a flight mechanic.
Flight mechanic was on the 130.

But as far as the flying part of it...
"Anyway, she flew the panel for him and he said, ""You've got a pilot's license."
"Now, I should just draw the"
"line, right, connecting those two points at -- that will give me the"
whole line.
"And if I've done this reasonably well,"
"I think it's going to happen to go through -- well,"
not happen -- it was arranged to go through that point.
"So I think that the second line is this one, and this is the"
all-important point that lies on both lines.
Shall we just check
"that that point which is the point x equal one and y was two,"
right?
"That's the point there and that, I believe, solves"
both equations.
Let's just check this.
"If x is one, I have a minus one plus four equals three,"
okay.
Apologies for drawing this picture that you've seen before.
"But this -- seeing the row picture -- first of all, for n equal 2,"
"two equations and two unknowns, it's the right place to start."
Okay.
So we've got the solution.
The point that lies on both lines.
Now can I come to the column picture?
"Pay attention,"
this is the key point.
So the column picture.
I'm now going to look at the columns of the matrix.
I'm going to look at this part and this part.
I'm going to say that
"the x part is really x times -- you see, I'm putting the two -- I'm"
kind of getting the two equations at once --
that part and then I have a y and in the first equation it's multiplying
What is the solution of negative two-fifths X equals ten?
"Once again we have to keep equality, so we're going to perform the same operation on both sides of the equation."
"So, we're going to multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of negative two-fifths, which is negative five-halves."
"Remember, when I multiply  negative five-halves times negative two-fifths, those numbers don't cancel out, they become one."
"So, I'm left with X is equal to negative fifty-halves, or X is equal to negative twenty-five."
"This looks like it's the solution for our equation, but we're not going to be positive until we check it."
"So, negative two-fifths X equals ten."
I'm going to substitute negative twenty five in for X and I get fifty over five equals ten.
"So, ten equals ten."
That makes negative twenty five the solution for this equation.
In this lesson you have learned that you can solve linear equations by using the multiplicative inverse.
"I'm going to be asking you a few questions, ok?"
Some of them may seem quite silly.
"Bear with me, alright?"
"First of all, we need to find out, do you know what day it is?"
What day of the week is it?
TUESDAY.
Tuesday.
What's the date?
"It's the 21 of July, 2009."
Fantastic.
And what season does that put us in?
SUMMER.
Summer.
OK.
Where are we now?
"FlRST FLOOR, IN PRlNCESS ROYAL."
And what city are we in?
KENT.
And what country are we in?
ENGLAND.
I'm going to ask you to remember 3 objects.
You're...
Moonlight Warrior!
Moonlight Warrior?
Wow.
That's not bad. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I'll be a warrior fighting against evil men like Sir Moonlight Black Hat!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
I will not forgive you in the name of justice!
Moonlight Warrior!
Why don't you finish your bowl of rice in the name of hunger?
Alright.
"Rice, I will finish you off in an instant!"
"Soup, you're with him!"
I'll destroy the both of you!
You are a true glutton of Joseon!
"When I see him next, I will definitely get his name."
"Your life is now at its lowest since you sold off your daughters. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;If you are to lift yourself up from there, you must invoke your sense of pride!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"If you really don't think you can make a difference, then you should just die!"
"If you're going to keep on living, then you must fight!"
I have been there and picked myself up.
He is right.
Let us pick ourselves from the pit and rise up together!
I forsook my own daughter and considered myself no less than an animal!
Thank you for helping us do something!
We'll do everything from this point on.
This is the promissory note that Choi Chul Joo wrote for me.
One day's interest is ten thousand yang.
"In ten days, he will owe a hundred thousand yang."
We will use his interest money and use it to buy back your daughters!
An eye for an eye!
A tooth for a tooth!
He will try and set sail as soon as possible to minimize the interest payments.
Do whatever it takes to stop that ship.
Security is high.
It goes like this.
"Woo, woo, woo, you are my flower,"
I want to pick you and put you to my heart.
Kimho played a wonderful melody from the cultural revolution of Mao in China.
Behind me on the screen there was a big pictue with three people.
A pilot
A soldier
I don't remember his gesture.
And a girl with a red cap.
Forth question:
What must a somali businessman do to get his business running?
On the picture there was a sentence in three languages.
We must free Taiwan!
Fith question:
"What happend indeed, when someone migrates?"
During this time I concerned myself alot with Taiwan.
I watched lots of videos on youtube.
"One video shocked me, as I heard about it 30 years late."
"It was about a resistance fighter from Taiwan, who opted for absolute freedom of speech."
The government said: we will catch you.
He said: no you will catch my corpse.
70 days he barricaded in his office.
Then the police came to arrest him.
Shortly before that he burned himself.
Some minutes later the police entered and you saw a black burned corpse on the floor.
You couldn't recognise him.
He turned thin as bones.
His skin turned to scurf.
His arms were like this: fists towards the sky.
His 9 year old daughter was at his funeral.
She looked into the casket and didn't recognise that it is her father.
She cried and didn't understand why she should watch that.
I'm really looking forward to how the MV turns out.
Anyway we're done in the U.S.
"We'll eat-up, sleep-in, and get on the plane back to Korea."
"one, two, cheese!"
"None one, two."

Hello
Hello everybody
Hello at the top
Do you remember years ago when they were making Braveheart?
"Everyone said, ""Oh it's ridiculous, Mel Gibson playing a Scottish guy; that's not going to be very convincing."""
Look at him now.
An alcoholic racist.
The most Scottish thing I've ever seen.
"I was going through a town called Bathgate at night. and there was a guy pissing against a front door,"
like that.
He then took out his keys and went inside.
I'm from Glasgow.
"If I had to explain Glasgow to you, I'd say that if I had to pick a city in the world where I could depend on a member of the public to punch a man who was on fire."
To punch a flaming man to the ground.
We should get a photo of that blown up. and use it as the welcome sign at Scottish airports.
"Underneath, we should have the words, ""Scotland welcomes careful drivers."""
I mean the naivety of Al Qaida trying to bring religious war to Glasgow.
We're four hundred years ahead of you guys.
You've not even got a football team.
"There's a fallacy, isn't there, that that baggage handler prevented hundreds of people from being horribly burnt."
These were Scottish people flying to Spain.
People say its good that they didn't hit a fuel depot.
I think it's good they didn't hit the queue coming out of the duty free.
It would have gone up like Hiroshima.
British army have got a big recruitment driving on in Scotland at the minute.
Because that's what you need when you're fighting an unwinnable war in the desert.

"""Blanksy's Beauties."""
No?
I've never even heard of that show.
"""Blanksy's Beauties"" aired only three months in 1977, and she was just 11."
Today she works as an administrator at a religious school.
"Her job history, as unsettled as her life."
She says she was 12 when she realized she had begun to live two lives at once-- the present and the past.
"Her mother, Roz."
She was not easy.
"And that's because everything that was going through her head, she couldn't explain."
"Her brother, Mike."
"There were things I would think to myself, why don't you just get over that."
She doesn't.
It was hard for them because they didn't really know what to do for me.
My brother is totally opposite of me.
"I'm screaming, and yelling, and crying, and they didn't really know what to do for me."
You can see the toll it seems to have taken on her year-by-year.
"This profound lesson she teaches about our memories, our lives."
"Is it possible our happiness and survival come from what we choose to edit, to forget?"
Because you said at one point that we have no idea how much of ourselves is created by editing our memories to shape ourselves.
Right.
And I don't do that.
"Like, I still feel bad about stuff that happened 30 years ago."
But we all do.
We can all remember one or two things.
But not one or two things.
Everything.
And I really live it and feel it.
"And I think, God, if I just done this, then I wouldn't have done this, and I wouldn't be here, and I'm always constantly doing that."
"Her father, Len, a Hollywood agent, looks back."
Most of us are like that oyster that has that little grain of sand.
Yes it is.
"And what is exciting about it is, because this grant involves students and research, the students get to be involved in, sort of, cutting-edge research."
No other institution in the country is looking at pennycress.
Or looking at this sort of approach at off-season seed production.
And so part of my job is to breed new varieties of pennycress.
And the big part of that is trying to produce more oil on these seeds.
"They are about 36 percent, right at the moment."
"And we're trying to get that, up to say, 40 to 45 percent."
And so a big part of this trying to look into these seeds and finding out how much oil is in there.
Beth Seaton:
How do you do that?
Win Phippen:
"Well, we've hired a chemist, and we have, it's called an ""automated GC"" or a gas chromatograph."
And it allows us to look inside these seeds to find out how much oil is in them.
"I actually have one next door, if you want to go over and take a look."
Beth Seaton:
"Yeah, let's take a look."
Win Phippen:
All right.
Beth Seaton:
Let's go.
Win Phippen:
So come on in.
This is the research lab.
And this is where we actually extract the oil right out of the seeds.
"Another grant that I wrote with the USDA allowed us purchase an automated gas chromatograph, and that allows us to actually look at the oils inside in the seed."
And so the first thing we have to do is we have to actually count these seeds.
Beth Seaton:
"So you count these little, tiny seeds?"
Win Phippen:
These tiny little seeds.
Beth Seaton:
"Unfortunately, Al Gore was busy but I did manage to speak to some other people who had quite a bit to say on the subject."
You look great.
Hello.
- Hi.
- Some information.
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
Hi.
- Hi.
Nice to meet you finally.
- Yeah.
You do such great work. - Thank you.
Having a good time?
Yeah.
What are you doing here at the moment?
"We're out here trying to show people that if they're eating meat, they're engaging in the number one environmentally most destructive behaviour they could engage in."
"And showing people that rather than cars and trucks, and SUVs even, rather than planes, meat is the number one cause of global warming."
Do people believe that when you tell them?
People are shocked to find out.
"We hear so much about cars, and trains and planes and energy, and people don't realise that it is actually the meat on their plate that's causing global warming rather than the car that they're driving even."
Some information here.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
How's it going?
Check that out when you have a chance.
Thank you.
Check that out.
Thank you.
"We use this catchy phrase ""cli-meat change""."
Its really just a way of to grab attention and get people to look in our direction long enough for us to give them a leaflet and explain the issue a little bit further.
OK.
"And get them to go home wondering how is it that meat causes global warming, rather than wondering what's on television tonight, or what am I going to have for dinner tonight."
Dr. Cartwright?
I recognize you from those courtroom drawings on the news.
You're much prettier in real life.
- May I sit?
"- Yes, please."
You're losing.
I had hoped Father Moore wouldn't need me... ...but I don't wanna see him put away.
How do you know him?
"Well, I was his parishioner at St. Vincent's Church... ...about 15 years ago."
I hadn't seen or heard of him for years when he called me last fall.
"But he needed help, so..."
"What kind of help, doctor?"
"He wanted a medical perspective from a psychiatrist... ...you know, one that he knew, trusted... ...to observe Emily's physical and mental state during this..."
During the exorcism.
Yeah.
Doctor.
Doctor.
Can you help our case?
"That girl was not schizophrenic... ...and she was not epileptic, or any combination of the two."
I've seen hundreds of people with those problems.
"They can be terrible afflictions, of course, but they don't scare me."
"But what you saw that night in Emily, that did scare you."
"God, if I'd known, I never would've been there."
"I started praying again since then, you know."
I examined that girl before I drove back to the city that night.
She was lucid... ...and she was completely aware of this separate entity inside her.
"When she wasn't in his grip, she was totally herself, completely normal."
The awareness of her alternate mental state is counterindicative of psychosis.
Crazy people don't know they're crazy.
That's right.
"You'll testify to all of this, in detail?"
Everything you saw?
Tape?
Who dares to throw it here?
"Salute, sir."
Everyone has different problems... ...and different solutions too.
Your daughter wants proof and we want your statement.
And you want your daughter's life.
On the reverse side of this tape... ...you must record in your voice that I'm telling you now.
Listen to it carefully.
"Dear daughter Radha, because of the lack of time... ...and danger from the goons, I'm forced to send you... ...with inspector Jaikishan and staff."
Inspector Jaikishan is very honest and trustworthy inspector.
You rest assured and stay there till I send you my next message.
"Rest, we'll talk later."
Your father Shreekant.
"After recording it, you'll keep it behind the big door of Mahalaxmi."
"Mr. Shreekant, if you or police will try to play any trick... ...I'll send you half a piece of Radha's body."
It will never happen.
Why are you breaking the utensils?
When daughter's body will come home you can break my skull.
I'll die but not bend at an ordinary goon.
Then I'll have to bend.
"Aunt, please try and explain him."
This is the time we must think practically.
After all it's a question of Radha's life.
"Come, Uma!"
"Why, Uma?"
Come Uma.
"Radha, this is Damodar."
"Because of the lack of time... ...and danger from the goons, we're forced to send you... ...with inspector Jaikishan and staff."
Inspector Jaikishan is very honest and trustworthy inspector.
You rest assured and stay there till I send you my next message.
"Rest, we'll talk later."
Fine!
"Granted it's not something that a normal person should do, and it is dangerous, but you have that awesome rush that  you get to brag to your friends afterwards."
Even if they don't get it.
When people lie and then you learn  about the facts of a story there's also change.
Like the 5 guys everybody believed  raped a girl at Hofstra University.
Oooh the hate they got.
A buncha black guys raped a girl.
Time to go crazy.
I think it's Crazy O'Clock.
"Oh shit, it is."
Then you find out that the girl was lying.
That it was consensual.
And this was from her lawyers mouth.
"Her statement also coincided with a video that was taken of the incident, that showed it was definitely consensual."
I know what you're thinking.
"""I can't believe the girl that was willing to have sex with 5 guys at the same time would lie."
"My world is upside down."""
But congratulations to that girl  because she is definitely our
"Douchebag of the Day for announcing to the world that she was gangbanged by 5 guys in a bathroom by saying that they raped her and later sayings,"
"""Whoops, I lied about it."
"It was just a gangbang."""
Kudos.
"There's also my favorite form of change, which is Photoshop."
"Or as I like to call it, lying."
And we're gonna talk about Jennifer Love Hewitt.
Because Jennifer Love Hewitt had  some photos taken of her and a lot of people were saying that she was fat.
"She went off, ""I'm not fat!"
I'm beautiful.
You don't have to be impossibly skinny.
"Be happy with who you are."""
Which I think is a great message for women.
"On the cover of the new Shape Magazine,  she is Photoshopped."
Oh the hypocrisy gets me so hard.
"An image I quite like is that of being a Trojan mule, if you excuse my metaphor."
"What we are trying to do, is to get into schools, universities anyhow."
"Then the process does the work, really."
But I'll just finish with the story about how off-putting mindfulness can be to some people.
"I have a lovely colleague, very eminent professors of University of Exeter, called Willem Kuyken."
His daughter said to him after he  came back after one of these dos saying how well it went.
"She said, ""You do know dad,  that mindfulness is for losers."""
(Laughter)
"He said, ""Okay, you are sure about that?"""
"She said, ""Yup."""
Then she phone him later.
"She said, "" I just want to clarify that a bit."""
"He thought, ""She is going to say, 'I don't really mean it, dad'""."
"She said:""I just want you to know that it is not just me that thinks that."""
(Laughter)
And this is a girl's experience  in home and so on.
"She is a teenager, anything her parents  do is automatically awful."
"It is important really to start where people are, and to make sure that we do this in ways that appeal to people and don't just gratify our own egos."
"Okay, thank you for your time."
"(R. Brady) Thank you, Katherine."
(Half bell)
(Bell)
"(R. Brady) Our next speaker is John Bell, who is the vice president of Youth Build USA."
He has a long career working with young people in leadership development in a variety of different kinds of settings.
"We'll hear more about what  he is doing, from John."
"(John Bell) Dear Thay, dear friends, let's see who is in the room first."
How many here are classroom teachers?
Please raise your hand.
"Wow, just take a look around."
Wave to each other.
(Laughter)
How many here are school leaders or school administrators?
I'll say it today before it's too late.
I've saved a woman from afire...
Saved a man from drowning...
"But now,"
Now...
I want to save a man who's fallen in love.
"I know it's too late, but..."
Please accept this.
The stadium will be open for use from 9am to 10pm.
The district will try to attract
Citizens from various classes.
Now some late-breaking news.
"This evening, a fire broke out in a shoe factory in Dobong-gu."
"The blaze killed two firemen on duty... and a third, unidentified victim."
The firemen killed were 40-year old Suh Ki-soo and 30-year old Lee Jin-woo.
38-year old Lee Jo-hyung was severely burned and moved to a hospital.
The tragedy occurred in the basement of the building as the dispatched firemen tried to extinguish the flames.
"Finally, Hong will report on tonight's weather."
Rain is falling across the nation.
"The rain should quell the 20-day heat wave and open the rainy season, according to the Weather Bureau."
The early arrival of the monsoon... will most likely continue for a month.
"Especially starting the next month, a seasonal rain front will..."
Please draw me again.
"Actually, I'm leaving to study abroad next month."
"I know, you punk."
That's why I'm showing it to you.
I don't show this to just anyone.
There was something I really wanted to draw before leaving.
"If the chance came, I thought I could draw it well."
I really thought... that I could draw it well.
I know it already.
"You wanted to draw me, but it didn't turn out as you expected."
"""And what does 32 and a half - that number - mean to you?"""

A and the right-hand side is also a vector that I'll always call b.
So linear equations are A x equal b and the idea now is to solve this
particular example and then step back to see the bigger picture.
"Okay, what's the picture for this example, the Row picture?"
"Okay, so here comes the Row picture."
So that means I take one row at a
time and I'm drawing here the xy plane and I'm going to plot all the
points that satisfy that first equation.
So I'm looking at all the
points that satisfy 2x-y =0.
It's often good to start with which
"point on the horizontal line -- on this horizontal line,"
y is zero.
"The x axis has y as zero and that -- in this case,"
"actually, then x is zero."
"So the point, the origin --"
"the point with coordinates (0, ) is on the line."
It solves that
equation.
"Okay, tell me in -- well, I guess I have to tell you"
another point that solves this same equation.
"Let me suppose x is one,"
so I'll take x to be one.
"Then y should be two,"
right?
So there's the point one two that also solves this equation.
And I could put in more points.
"But, but let me put in all the"
"points at once, because they all lie on a straight"
line.
This is a linear equation and that word linear got the letters for
line in it.
"Now I can see the suggested route to my destination, the length of the ride, and also the price estimate."
We've arrived.
I'm paying for the ride and I'm rating the driver.
I was very satisfied.
Done.
You can see how very easy all of this was.
"Instead of waiting, the driver got a job thanks to Liftago."
"As a passenger, I am happy with the service."
I didn't wait in vain and my order didn't depend on a single phone number or on a single transport company.
I chose the best driver around.
I was able to see his price in advance and his rating.
I knew who would pick me up and in what car.
"Actually, I didn't have any trouble at all."
"With Liftago, we're creating a free taxi market."
Hassle-free for passengers and hassle-free for taxi drivers.
"The better and more convenient service we provide, the more orders we get for Liftago drivers."
And that is our goal.
"Thanks to the skills of the whole community of marketers, we can create something truly great together."
"Just imagine that in a few years, we'll be as important for city transport as Google is right now with searching for information on the internet."
Good luck!

Yeah.
"Um, so I, so I do our newsletter so and the spell check, so. , people are just going to scale down hopefully, on the phone and stuff like that, but we still need to rethink the whole ,, ."
"I don't know if you could share this information, but do you have any idea how many people your newsletter goes out to?"
"Um, I think we have, uh, 1,300, I think."
"Okay. ,, ."
"Just curious, um."
"So this, you're bringing up an int..."
"We've only had a newspaper, newsletter for so, so long, so..."
Yeah.
You're bringing up an interesting course idea for me.
"Which is, um."
Taking an existing website and going through a redesign to become more responsive.
No.
"Sir, but why?"
Forget this case.
But it's such an interesting case.
"Interesting yes, but it's also a police case."
But...

"Fine, I won't take it up."
"But as medical students, we want to know."
Okay...
That is Sanjay Singhania.
Hit on the head with an iron rod.
"After the incident, he lost his memory."
He is unable to remember anything now.
We call it short term memory loss.
He remembers events for only about 15 minutes.
Afterwards... he forgets everything.
"For example, he'd ask your name... and in 15 minutes he will have forgotten it."
He recalls only fragments of the incident.
But we can't say how much of it he remembers.
"Regular tasks like eating, drinking, driving, also his feelings..."
lie embedded in his sub-conscious mind.
How does he go about his everyday routine?
How does a child perform instructed tasks?
"By committing to memory, learning by rote."
"Or, by jotting things down in writing."
"Likewise, he remembers tasks by writing."
What was that incident?
Who assaulted him?
"This, no one knows."
"Unfortunately, he doesn't even recall a face."
How can someone live on like this...
How does it feel now that it's over?

"Thursday he said — if taxpayers have to foot the bill , then. ""we want something in return."
"And that is the videos of all the sex posted online so we can see."""
That got Limbaugh's critics fired up.
As an anchor for WFLD somewhat tentatively puts it.
"""Wow."
"You can um, imagine um, that sparked a lot of um, reaction and not very well, negative as you can imagine."""
Because this'll have some positive value.
It might have an insignificantly small value.
We could make it 0.000001.
But it's still going to have some positive value.
"So no matter what y we choose, as long as it's greater than 0, 2x minus 3y will be greater than 2x."
"So we could say that as long as if 2x is less than x squared for any x we pick, then 2x minus 3y is definitely going to be less than x squared."
Why is that?
"Because minus 3y is going to subtract from the 2x, because we know that y is greater than 0."
So let me ask you a question.
Is 2x always going to be less than x squared if x is greater than 2?
Sure.
"I mean whatever x is, on the left-hand side it's going to be 2 times--pick a random number--2 times xŁŹit could be 2.5."
"But on the other side, on the right-hand side, you're going to have 2.5 squared."
"So if you think about it, you're going to have 2 times a number."
That's always going to be less than--ŁŹthat number which happens to be larger than 2 squared.
The smallest possible is 2 times 2.0001.
You could make a lot of 0's there.
But I think you get the point.
That's still going to be less than 2.0001 squared.
Because you only have a 2 here instead of a 2.0001.
"So actually, statement 2 alone is sufficient."
Hopefully that made sense.
"You just have to see oh, if y is greater than 0, then the 3y is definitely going to take away from the 2x."
"Then as long as x is greater than 2, 2x is always going to be less than x squared."
"If that makes sense to you, then you should realize that statement 2 alone is sufficient for this."
That was interesting.
"Oh, no sorry."
Either of them alone were sufficient.
"We did that in the first one, right?"
"Statement 1 or statement 2, independently are sufficient to answer that question."

"A report consisting of 2,600 words is divided into 23 paragraphs."
It was when Golgotha killed Dardane.
"And surprise surprise, the very same day you find an item that is not even referenced in the loots's list of Horizon 1.1."
"Comrades, this is a critical moment, an emergency meeting is a must."
"Come on, follow me... and you, come here."
Okay I see.
I need to contact Tenshirock as soon as possible.
What is the date...
Tenshirock.
"Tenshirock, Tenshirock !"
- I absolutely needed to see you.
"- Really, what for ?"
This.
Well !
If it isn't my favorite little noob.
"Can you tell me why you give him a cheated item while me, your old friend for ages, I get nothing."
"Ash, Ash, Ash."
We are not going to talk about this again.
"I already explained my motives to you : if I give you just one item, created by me, you're going to resale it right away to those poor souls who are enchained in their virtual world."
And you'll feed their addiction.
"Me, I'm here to set them free."
There is no such thing as a worthless trade... and you didn't answer my question.
Noob power.
What?
"Noob power, it is nothing else than my brilliant plan to decolonise the MMORPG."
I already regret asking...
And how do you plan to handle it this time ?
"Well, as usual, a small demonstration is better than a long speech, look."
"Comrades, this item is a threat to the Noob guild."
We are near the destruction.
"If one of the game master sees us with it, nobody will escape."
And our avatars will be deleted.
This staff is a gift... a gift to the foes of the Noob guild.
"I mean, I don't have any doubt that the Coupe is a little bit better."

This car is barely a convertible.
The roof aperture is so small it's more of a targa really.
And it's quite a fussy shape from some angels.
Those rear buttresses rise unexpectedly high.
And those ultra-low profile tires leave annoying amounts of vacant space in the wheel arches.
"And this particular example has 63,000 pounds of extras on top of the 200 grand list price."
"The titanium wheel bolts are 1,900 pounds."
[CAR ENGlNE]
"But it's just, it's a very, very exciting car."
"It's very obedient, the steering's fast."
The controls lack quite a lot of feedback.
But it's really interesting how quickly you can kind of adjust your inputs to the speed that they require.

"Now I have to apologize, because I haven't talked about the clever folding hard top or the neat gear shifts in auto mode."
I didn't have the time.
"Because remember, I was too busy driving the 458 Spider"
like I was in some sort of computer game.
"But in doing so, I can now tell you that it's an absurdly good car to drive."
"You can chuck it around like a cheap rally car, and that shouldn't really be possible."
Of course I could never buy a convertible Ferrari for all the obvious reasons.
But I could just about forgive anyone who bought one of these.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; VOlCE:
"Oh, I know her. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; VOlCE:"
"Woa, Conan's on Twitter? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; VOlCE:"
She never eats.
Never drinks.
Never goes to the toilet.
"The female polar bear is number 6 because she sleeps for over three months,"
living off her fat reserves.
She not only survives the winter-- but creates two new lives.
The young bears learn their survival skills from mother.
"How to keep warm, what to eat, where to walk."
They must learn fast-- or freeze solid-- just like the animal sliding into number 5.
Only one frog in the world is found north of the Arctic Circle.
The wood frog.
It has to survive the northern winter.
The frog is cold blooded.
"So when the ground freezes, so does the frog."
Cold's not the problem.
It's the ice.
The crystals expand like daggers.
"For most animals, freezing means certain death."
But not this frog.
The first ice crystal forming on its skin sets off a chain reaction.
The cells prepare by filling with glucose-- a natural antifreeze.
The fluid between the cells contains proteins that attract ice-- quickly forming crystals small enough to prevent injury.
Blood freezes in veins.
And the ice races towards the heart.
"In 20 hours, the frog is frozen."
70% of the water in its body is ice.
There's no breathing.
No heartbeat.
The wood frog is number 5 because it survives the winter in suspended animation.
Essentially there's no frog here at all.
"It's just a collection of individual cells, suspended in ice, struggling to stay alive."
The frog spends months locked inside its frozen time capsule.
"And the sharpest rock on the wildest shore can never break that ocean apart, they can never wear that ocean down, because it's the ocean that shapes the shore."
That's what we're starting to do here today.
That's what we're starting to do here this week.
"With wave after wave after wave crashing against that shore, we shape it to our vision."
Thank you all for being a part of that.

"Well, how should I...?"
"I don't actually think I've ever given a talk on the history of Mozilla to a large set of people, which is pretty shocking..."
Ok!
So...
I'm gonna give it a try.
I'm not sure if I've actually given a talk on the history of Mozilla to this many people.
So that's probably an indication that I need to do more of it.
"Mozilla's been around for a long time, since 1998."
And I thought when we got started...
I'd like to ask:
"Of the people here, how many have been in Mozilla for three months or less?"
Can you raise your hand?
"Ok, excellent."
How many have been here a year or so?
That's a pretty good group too.
"Ok, how about the five year?"
Pretty good and I'm gonna say the ten year.
How many people?
"Who's around, though?"
"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine..."
So there's nine people in this room that have been working on Mozilla for ten years and more.
And there's probably another nine or ten people in this gathering today who have been here that long as well.
And so I'm gonna explain the different roles that we had in the early days.
"I'll try to name some names as we go along, I won't get all of those names, but if you see this people and have questions about Mozilla or Mozilla's history, find a good time and ask them, because we all have many memories."
"So, Mozilla started in 1998."
We are in charge of His Majesty's wellbeing as well  as maintaining the palace traditions and rules.
We are the hidden hands that allow the palace to function smoothly.
Everything we do is for His Majesty and the palace.
All of you need to remember and remind yourselves of this.
Yes sir.
"Since the King is new on the throne, all eunuchs  are to be on standby without any shift changes."
If you stay here His Majesty will be in danger.
Don't move a muscle.
"I said, don't move!"
Who is that person?
He came with a recommendation from Yoon-jungho Minister.
Yoon-jungho Minister ... hmm.
He is the future of the palace inner power.
What do you mean?
"Since you became the Head of Eunuchs, you have become sneaky."
As for you...you may be a rat sitting on top of rice pot  but you never know when your luck will run out.
"If you want to stay there for long time, you need  to learn to tame young ones like him."
"Worrying about your food bowl, you must be getting old as well."
What would be more important than one's food bowl?
"You know, I almost got beheaded this time."
"I trust you, so please take care of me in the future as well ... hmm?"
"Your Majesty, please lay to the left of the queen."
"Your Majesty, raise your left side  so that your heart will be higher."
"First, kiss the lower lip and suckle it."
Then you must swallow her saliva.
"Place your hand on her lower stomach, then start caressing her."
Continue until her breast enlarges...
Then cover her breast with one hand; cover it completely.
"Your Majesty, you may start your movement."
"The Queen must embrace His Majesty's waist,  then accept his penetration."
"Your Majesty, I am ready, so go ahead."
You may feel the pleasure building.
And they're like pissed.
"Well, as pissed as a news anchor can be."
"-Boy, that interview on osteoporosis on Good Morning America sounded a lot better now than it did a few minutes ago."

-Don't be trolling girl.
So naturally my question is: so you missed the bridge falling; you can't rewind the tape and watch it?
"I mean, you're a news center."
Do don't have that kind of technology?
Or you couldn't do a split-screen?
Even I can do a split-screen.
"Hell, I can do a triple screen with the troll."
"""Triple screens are gay and so is your face... yo."""
"I don't know, I don't want to rip on him"
'cause I don't know how news stations work.
"But anyway, back to my original point."
"This video's funny, but why 8 million views?"
I don't get it.
"Maybe if they took her and crammed her into a dryer or if they took him and rammed his head into a fire extinguisher, then it would get 8 million views and we would all go"
"""Yeah, I get it."""
"Not that I recommend ramming a news anchor's head into a fire extinguisher,"
I'm just sayin'.
"If such a thing did happen, the video might go viral."
But you know what else you should cram into a dryer?
"The comment question of the day, which comes from a user named, bing!, and she said..."

Thanks for watching today's episode of =3.
I'm Ray William Johnson and I approve this message.
"Oh real quick,"
He was a wise professor of sociology from Michigan.
"A ""Mandela"" type."
There were only eight of us at the meeting.
Afterwards he asked what we were studying and when we'd be done.
I said I would finish med school in 1975.
"""We'll probably be independent then, come work for us."" We shook on it."
Then he was killed by a letter bomb the next year.
That made the promise more serious.
In 1975 Mozambique won its independence.
"We founded the Africa Groups' Recruitment Organization and then we went, Agneta as a midwife and me as a doctor."
This is the hospital staff outside the hospital.
"White coats are professionally trained, the others were assistants."
A fair amount of them were illiterate.
Papa Enrique is wearing my glasses.
He dressed wounds.
I saw that he treated infected wounds and burns the same way.
"""Can't you see the difference?"""
I asked.
Then I gave him my glasses.
"""Now I see!"" he said."
"""There's pus in this wound."
"I can't afford glasses."""
So I gave him my spare glasses.
It gave him a whole new life.
And he provided a whole new class of care.
"When I wrote instructions, he said:"
"""Unfortunately I cannot read."""
Eventually we created two symbols.
Infections were marked with a cross and he took those last.
The hardest part was understanding the depth of poverty.
We knew we couldn't give the same kind of care as in Sweden of 1970 but we didn't realize we had to go back to 1850.
Eventually we learned to treat fractures without plaster or anesthetic.
We're not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on a dinosaur.
But birds are dinosaurs.
Birds are living dinosaurs.
We actually classify them as dinosaurs.
We now call them non-avian dinosaurs and avian dinosaurs.
So the non-avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct.
Avian dinosaurs are our modern birds.
So we don't have to make a dinosaur because we already have them.
(Laughter)
"I know, you're as bad as the sixth-graders."
(Laughter)
"The sixth-graders look at it and they say, ""No."""
(Laughter)
"""You can call it a dinosaur, but look at the velociraptor: the velociraptor is cool."""
(Laughter)
"""The chicken is not."""
(Laughter)
"So this is our problem, as you can imagine."
The chicken is a dinosaur.
I mean it really is.
You can't argue with it because we're the classifiers and we've classified it that way.
(Laughter) (Applause)
But the sixth-graders demand it.
"""Fix the chicken."""
(Laughter)
So that's what I'm here to tell you about: how we are going to fix a chicken.
So we have a number of ways that we actually can fix the chicken.
"Because evolution works, we actually have some evolutionary tools."
We'll call them biological modification tools.
We have selection.
And we know selection works.
We started out with a wolf-like creature and we ended up with a Maltese.
How does that not drive you crazy?
You get used to it.
I know you're all excited because got the gown on but under no circumstance are you to curtsy.
He can say what he wants.
The bottom line is he's showing me off.
Dr Bension.
"Oh, just give us a second."
Will you big guy.
Did you hear about it.
Watching Dr Cox I realized we never really stop craving the attention of people we look up to.
Any questions?
Great.
He seemed nice.
Careful newbie
You know I'm hearing it now.
It's kinda annoying when I talk.
I guess in a lot of relationships you regress to the person you were when you first met
So Elliot's exam was that bad
Dude she violated me.
Ina good way?
What's the deal?
Ah!!!
I think I broke my ass.
I heard
Well of course.
"The hope is, and experience shows that material like this does contribute to reduced civilian casualties and a higher threshold for war and more cautious planning for war."
"And hopefully, in this case, and understanding and careful planning for what the exit policy is for Afghanistan."
This is a war that has been going on now for nine years and is clearly been getting worse for the past three years.
Something has got to change in this equation.
"And soldiers, foot soldiers, are of course victims of war."
"They do benefit to some degree, I mean they benefit in terms of their career and in terms of money."
"These are not people, frequently not people that are totally innocent unless they are conscripts."
"We've already gotten used to the world of vegetation and are no longer amazed,but truthfully what does it resemble from a real viewpoint?It's just like if someone would ask you how many cellphones you would like for free,from the new generation phones,how many would you like for free?So you say if it's free give me 300."
I have people to give them out to.
"So he tells you,no problem."
"Buy this phone,which costs 30 Shekels."
"Go to your yard,dig a hole,plant the phone in the ground,cover it,water it and wait till it rusts,before it turns rusty it won't work.But afterwards..."
"You're looking at him shocked but he continues and tells you that after it rusts,you will suddenly see that an antenna will grow from this  phone and many phones will grow at the head of the antenna."
How will this sound?
"Totally strange,right?If you take a person from the North Pole who doesn't know what planting and growing is."
All he ever saw was ice.He never heard or knew of such a thing.
"If you tell him that a seed is planted in the ground,goes through a process and grows a stem which has tens of grains on its head."
How will that sound to him?
Totally strange!
He will say that it's not true!
It's like a phone that grows.
It's not logical.We've already gotten used to it so we are not amazed.
"God tells man,are you surprised that I will resurrect the dead in the future?"
"Look,I do it now in the world of vegetation."
This is the tale of Mister Morton
Mister Morton is who?
"He is the subject of our tale, and the predicate tells what Mister Morton must do."
Mister Morton walked down the street.
Mister Morton walked.
Mister Morton talked to his cat.
Mister Morton talked.
"(""Hello, cat."
"You look good."")"
Mister Morton was lonely.
Mister Morton was...
"Mister Morton is the subject of the sentence, and what the predicate says, he does."
Mister Morton knew just one girl.

Mister Morton grew flowers for Pearl.
Brandon:
Ok.
Ok I like that.
That's not one I usually put up there but that's a very good point.
Characters should act like themselves.
And you can't get to know someone if they're not consistent.
"In fact, characters in books tend to be far more consistent than people are in real life."
This is case of truth is stranger than fiction.
"And in the book, you're going to have to give foreshadowing and reasoning for why a character's acting that way if they're acting erratically, which they can do, that in real life you may never not give."
"You might just be a moody person, and you're jumping all over the place."
In the book you'll have to establish that this is a moody person.
"Alright, what else?"
Student:
"They have depths in their interests, and what they think about."
Brandon:
"Ok, depth."
That's a good one.
What else?
Student:
Something you aspire to be.
Brandon:
OK.
That's one of the other big three that I usually point out.
"In a lot of ways, I view characters like this:"
"It's almost like there's a continuum between what we call the ""everyman"" and the ""superman"" or woman."
The idea being that these two things are kind of core concepts that make up what attaches us to a character.
"Either we see what we are in them, or we see what we want to be in them."
And a lot of times you will have books that this is the growth archetype of the character.
Can you think of one of these?
Student:
Star Wars.
Brandon:
So in the end I didn't get written up again.
Another letter from whoever it was that charges these spy planes crew get another letter from them thanking us for the job done.
And then I get promoted.
The average staff sergeant made it in somewhere between 7 and 9 years and I made it a little over 3.
"And every time I got in trouble, I got promoted."
"Because, we did stuff."
It was a special request mission and you broke the regulations but helped out...
"Yeah, well, we had to do it."
Because it was our job.
Our line pilots.
We didn't have any trouble with our
line pilots.
"These guys are up to 30, 32 years old."
"You get in to maybe a colonel or something, he's"
looking at the back a little bit.
The other guy - you wanted to load up didn't care what you were loading.
"Now load it, they'd fly it."
That was it.
"Now, did you ever speculate on what was in that trailer?"
No.
"Just electronic gear, I'm sure."
Because they were still flying the U-2s.
He'd been shot down already but they were still flying
U-2s and the RB-57s.
There was a B-57 they converted to - Now you see these big 747 jet engines.
At the time - a 707 engine was yay big.
They had those engines that were bigger than that window on the U-2 and on these RB-57s - reconnaissance.
That they had converted to fly reconnaissance missions.
And an RB-57 will do almost as high as a U-2.
They'd take off from there and they'd have to fly
South from Pakistan.
"To get up to 70,000 feet or so, and then turn over to Russia, and land over in Sweden, you know, taking pictures on the way."
Can there be enlightenment  without light?

"I don't know if it says 'Tim,'"
I am not sure if it's what...
Okay.
"'Buddha,"

Am I saying something  like we know?
"'...Shiva, Jesus in [Matthew 6:21] all speaks of the light, as does Ramana Maharshi.'"
He describes it as self-effulgent.
'Can these be...
Can there be enlightenment without light?'
"If enlightenment... we're using this term,  'enlightenment'; enlightenment means to bring light  to the mind, maybe, not to the Self."
"Because even the term 'guru,' it means the remover of darkness, which, here, means ignorance, not the giver of light, even."
But let's speak  about this light.
Does the Self  need to be enlightened?
It cannot be.
"It gives light to consciousness and the mind, but It, itself,  is the source of light."
But light  is also a phenomenon;
light is also perceived.
"Space is also perceived, because it is said that amongst all the elements known to us, that space is the most subtle."
"And we are the perceivers  of space, so something subtler  also than space is here."
To the extent that we can say even the perceiving of space  is perceived.
You cannot use your mind here.
"Mind will only create images and images are gross forms, are emanating out of that."
"The image is itself seen, the image  cannot witness itself."
A cloud doesn't know  it is passing.
A flower doesn't know  it is beautiful.
To whom do they appear?
This one.
And this one sees them with the light of consciousness.

"As a medical student, I want to know how..."
Camera beeps
What's that?
My camera.
Why is it beeping?
It buzzes every 15 minutes.
"So that I can take photos... of important things, people... to inscribe on them, to remember."
On photos?
Yes.
What are you doing?
Making notes...
"I grew up on Oracle from Oracle four on, and there are some really awesome features in Oracle."
- That's so sad.
- It would take those 3000 queries and actually work whereas mostly [indecipherable]
"- Oh yeah, no, no, no, no."
"The 3000 queries was, in fact, Oracle, and it did, in fact, work just fine eventually."
- 9000 seconds later.
"- It just took a while to run, no problem."
- Are you saying qualifying the dates or indexing the dates or both out of curiosity?
All of the above?
"Oracle dates, time stamps."
"Sequel, JBC when you're using a NS timestamp will output a Java sequel timestamp."
"If you have your Oracle column set to date,"
Oracle then in the database has to convert that Java sequel time stamp into a date.
"If you've used that date, say as a partition column, you're going to have a query that takes 100 to 200 times longer to execute than if you had just passed in a time stamp, or if you used a time stamp for your partition column."
There's a nice work‑around.
I'm not sure if there's a techno publish for it.

"He said, ""Hey, Kathy, you stick with me, you'll have your 4-engine commercial in a year."""
But this... she's married to - they took the motorcycles and shipped them to Anchorage - from Anchorage down to Seattle.
Rode down through California with him and over through Vegas.
"Ran into a sleet storm in northern Arizona and I told her when she got to Seattle,"
"""Put your bikes in there."""
"""Oh, no, Dad, this will be nice."" ... what the hell, young, you know."
But when they run into bad weather they rented a van and put their bikes in there and drove it to North
Carolina.
"For some reason or other, he wanted to go there."
So she did good - she worked at IBM for a little while and then she got this job and she wanted the mechanic but now she's got her instrument rating.
She's got her

She can sign off any airplane made.
Or grounded.
And right now she's picking up her commercial license.
She's flying a brand new diamond.
"About $280,000 airplane, getting her instrument readings."
"Got the new flatscreens, instrument type stuff."
"It was funny, she called here last year."
She had to run in the middle of the night and - instrument time.
She went over to Myrtle Beach and over to South Carolina.
"But she was coming to Columbia the controller - it's nasty weather - it was real instrument time, it wasn't under the hood."
"So, he calls - a 737 is coming in behind her so -"
Whatever outfit it was - delta such and such or whatever.
"He says, ""Slow down a little bit."
I got a girl with a diamond up ahead of you.
"She's not quite your speed."""
"Kathy said, ""I damn near told him I could go that fast."""
She was coming in with this instrument.
It was the defendant.
Counselor.
Ethan Thomas calls himself a man of faith.
"I, on the other hand, am a woman of doubt."
Angels and demons.
God and the devil.
"These things either exist, or they do not exist."
Are we all alone in this life?
Or are we not alone?
Either thought is astonishing.
Do I really believe that this tragedy is the work of the devil?
"To be honest, I don't know."
But I cannot deny that it's possible.
The prosecution wants you to believe... ...that Emily's psychotic epileptic disorder was a fact... ...because facts leave no room for reasonable doubt.
But this trial isn't about facts.
This trial is about possibilities.
Is it a fact that Emily was a hypersensitive... ...as Dr. Adani suggests?
"A person who's more likely, by her very nature, to become possessed?"
"I can't say that, but the question is:"
Is it possible?
Is it a fact that Gambutrol anesthetized Emily's brain... ...so that the exorcism ritual was rendered ineffective?
I can't be sure of that.
But is it possible?
Is it a fact that Emily was beloved by God?
"And that after her exorcism, she chose to suffer till the end... ...so that we might believe in a more magical world?"
A world where the spiritual realm really exists?
I can't say that's a fact.
But ask yourself:
Is it possible?
It's what Emily believed.
It's what Father Moore believed.
And that sincere belief is what determined her choices and his.
"They drink the water they know is dirty, they get cholera, they get diarrhea, they get jaundice and they die."
And governments have not been able to provide clean water.
They try and build it.
They try and build pipelines; it doesn't happen.
And the MNCs give them machines that they cannot afford.
So what do you do?
Do you let them die?
"Well, somebody had a great idea."
And it was a simple idea.
It was an idea that could not profit anybody but would help health in every field.
Most houses in Asia and India have a cotton garment.
"And it was discovered, and WHO endorses this, that a clean cotton garment folded eight times over, can reduce bacteria up to 80 percent from water sieved through."
"So, why aren't governments blaring this on television?"
Why isn't it on every poster across the third world?
Because there is no profit in it.
Because nobody can get a kickback.
But it still needs to get to people.
And here is one of the ways we get it to people.

Man:
You know how expensive those are.
"I have a solution that requires neither machine, nor wood, nor cooking gas."
Woman:
What solution?
Man:
"Listen, go fetch that cotton sari you have."
Boy:
"Grand-dad, tell me the solution please."
Man:
I will tell all of you.
"So, the kind of programming , the kind of programming that is going on."
And I'm asking you to just stay as only the awareness of it.
You're aware of that.
"And somehow in being aware that you're observing a kind of pattern, a kind of story, a kind of picturing."
"Because this is what actually happens quite often, is that there is a picture, you've a little youtube in your head, of somebody going , 'I'm having a baby'"
'being happy and it's like forever'.
Although it is only 10 minutes.
"It's kind of , you know.."
"You tube is only 10 minutes, but you can.."
"So, like this and something, the mind embellishes everything else."
It fills in.
This is how it is.
"You suggest something and the mind fills in all the other parts of it, like this."
"And so, it is the mind that is addicted to it's own projections."
And you've identified with the mind.
And so some of the stain feels like it is coming off on you.
That is the 'I' who want it.
"So, it's a bit entangled there, you see."
"So, I only say, that you're aware of this."
This activity of the mind or personality.
"It's creating these pictures, Ok?"
"So, just now, even now, you can do, that you're aware of what you've spoken also."
Something is aware of this.
There is an awareness of this.
That's the awareness of.
"But now I'm pointing you just to the awareness, without the 'of', something, you see."
In which anything can come.
Ok.
"Well, this story of wanting this, you know, shining prince or whatever, it comes and goes."
"It's not constant, continuously in your mind."
Is it?
No.
leads a lonely existence.
"A bright boy who loves science, he cannot succeed in school."
"Forgetful and willful, Nathan has been a handful from the beginning."
Getting out of line and talking in class--
"Those were some things. --kicking other kids, you know."
From kindergarten on there were signs of discipline problems.
So Nathan's parents had him tested.
They came up with a diagnosis of ADD without hyperactivity.
And so we knew that the pencils rolling on the desk or dropping or anything like that would probably take him off task.
It's like a jigsaw puzzle.
Some days I wake up and it's just like two or three pieces to put together.
And other times it's like 500 3D puzzle or something.
Ritalin was prescribed.
But Nathan's parents learned there was no magic pill.
We went up to 10 milligrams.
It helped for a little while.
But we still had the problems with getting the assignments home.
So his parents took him off Ritalin.
But now they had nothing.
"He would be real sad that he was not able to learn, that people didn't like him, that they were out to, you know, ridicule him or make fun of him."
He got to where he hated everything when he started school.
He didn't want to
"learn, didn't want to read, didn't want to write."
Didn't want to go.
He didn't want to go.
"A lot of times when, you know, he's not in a good mood and he's real irritable and says stuff like why am I even here and stuff, I get real worried."
I hope he doesn't get too drastic.
"And when he said, I just shouldn't be alive."
"I said, this child does not have to go through this."
His parents are desperate.
"For them, public school is not working and private school is too expensive."
"So his mom, Edie, is trying home schooling."
NCATS is going to do.
[Applause]
"The last thing, just to illustrate how NCATS is going to do things differently and, may I say, better,"
"I'm going to show you what real music is, and so let's take it away."
"I should say, how did I choose this?"
"Glen and I chose this in a somewhat whimsical way but somewhat with a serious note, and it gets to what I started saying."
"This is an aria from The Marriage of Figaro by Mozart and, as some of you may know, Mozart died at the age of 37 of causes which aren't entirely known, but there was some sort of infectious disease, perhaps a urinary tract infection or tuberculosis."
Just imagine if Mozart had not died at age 37.
What could he have created that our world would have to enjoy?
"That didn't happen, and it doesn't happen for so many patients now, and we can change that."
[Applause]
I want to make little townhouse shapes with toothpicks.
So this would be my first townhouse.
"I've used 3 toothpicks so far-- 4, 5, and 6."
So that is my first townhouse.
"Now, let me make a little table here keeping track of things."
So I'll do that in white.
So here's my table to keep track of things.
"So this is the number of houses, and then this is the toothpicks that I'm using to make that house."
"So this first house here, took me 6 toothpicks-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6."
Now let's make our second house.
And these are going to be townhouses.
They're going to share common walls.
"So I'm going to add 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 toothpicks for my second house."
"Now, why did I only have to add 5 and not 6?"
"Well, they shared a common wall here so I didn't have to add another toothpick here for this left-hand side wall."
"So starting with the first house,"
I really just had to add 5 toothpicks.
I had to add 5 toothpicks to get to now 11 total toothpicks if I want two houses.
I think you see the trend here.
What about 3 of these?
"Well, this is going to be another 5-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 toothpicks."
And his Enigma machine is exactly the same as the first one.
So there's something I have to do.
I now need to set these rotors to the correct position.
"So we've got this code over here, Y-T-H-M-Y and whatever."
Let's type that into the machine this time and see what happens.
"OK, so we start with Y. Y becomes N. T becomes U. H becomes M. M, in the code, is a B. Y. I. F. And W, finally, is E. So each rotor has 26 starting places."
"In fact, these rotors come out and swap over."
"In fact, again, they had five rotors to pick from."
They had a box of five rotors.
You would pick three from a box of five.
"And already, we've got thousands of settings."
And each one will produce a different code.
So we're going to work out those combinations.
"So the first thing I said was, we pick three rotors from a box of five."
"In the first slot, you would have five rotors to pick from."
"Once you've picked that, in the second place, you would have four rotors to pick from."
"And in the final place, the third place, you would have three rotors left."
And you multiply those numbers together.
So it's 5 times 4 times 3.
So there are 60 ways that you can put in three rotors from a choice of five.
We have 26 starting positions for each rotor.
"So we have 26 choices for the first one, 26 choices for the second one, and 26 choices for the third one."
"And if you do that, you get 26 cubed, which is 17,576."
"It gets worse, because the military, the Army, Air Force,"
Navy had something extra.
"The commercial machines-- if you were a bank or a business, you could buy an"
Enigma machine to use yourself to send your own secrets.
But the military had an extra bit.
They had this thing at the front of the machine.
"Now, this is called a plugboard."
"And it's like an old-fashioned telephone switchboard, like an old patchboard."
We have 10 of these wires.
They are impervious to heat and magnetism.
These smart arms are controlled by my brain through a neural link.
Nanowires feed directly into my cerebellum... ...allowing me to use these arms to control fusion reaction... ...in an environment no human hand could enter.
"Doctor, if the artificial intelligence in the arms... ...is as advanced as you suggest... ...couldn't that make you vulnerable to them?"
How right you are.
Which is why I developed this inhibitor chip... ...to protect my higher brain function.
"It means I maintain control of these arms, instead of them controlling me."
And now on to the main event.
"Give me the blue light, Rosie."
Precious tritium is the fuel that makes this project go.
There's only 25 pounds of it on the whole planet.
I'd like to thank Harry Osborn and Oscorp lndustries for providing it.
"Happy to pay the bills, Otto."
Ladies and gentlemen... ...fasten your seat belts.
"Doctor, we have a successful fusion reaction."
This is a breakthrough beyond your father's dreams.
Thank you.
We're producing a thousand-megawatt surplus.
The power of the sun... ...in the palm of my hand.
Keep calm!
Is only a spike!
Iil soon stabilize!
"Ladies and gentlemen, please clear the room."
We have a containment breach!
"Otto, please get back!"
"Shut it off, Otto!"
Shut it off!
It will stabilize!
Is under control!
I'm in charge here!
Is my money!
I'm in con...
And without the consent of the possessed... ...the exorcism ritual can't be performed.
Did you encourage her to eat?
"Yes, every time I saw her... ...but the few times she tried, it seemed like..."
"Seemed like she couldn't swallow, or she couldn't keep it down."
What about medical care?
I wanted her to continue.
I never said she should quit seeing her doctors.
That would be wrong.
Medical care is not my field.
But you did suggest she stop taking the drug Gambutrol.
Yes.
"After the exorcism, she asked for my counsel."
She told me that the drugs had never helped her.
"After all, she was on Gambutrol during the exorcism... ...when her so-called symptoms were at their peak."
"Ultimately, we both felt that she was beyond medical care... ...and that she had to see this through to the end... ...by faith alone."
The dual voices we just heard on this tape... ...you're certain that they were both coming from Emily at the same time?
Yes.
"Yes, I heard them."
Have you tampered with this tape in any way?
No.
"No, I have not."
No further questions at this time.
Mr. Thomas.
"Father Moore, you consider this tape to be proof of the supernatural?"
I think it's a record of certain indications... ...that Emily was possessed.
"Signs of possession, you may call them."
"By ""signs of possession,"" would you mean her speaking in languages... ...we might assume she couldn't possibly know?"
And the vocalization of two distinct voices simultaneously?
Yes.
Among other signs that I observed and described to the court... ...while the tape was playing.
Things I saw.
Things you can't hear on the tape.
"The light that emanates from consciousness, this is revealing the forms of the creation,  you see."
So that is also seen.
"So, the question:"
"Sri Ramana, he describes it as  self-effulgent."
Not relying  upon something else.
Not relying  upon something else.
"The moon, they say, has no light of its own."
I am told this;
I never could prove it.
"They say the moon  doesn't have a light of its own, that it is reflecting only  the light from the sun."
"This is what I'm told,  like that."
Okay?
The sun is not depending  on something else.
The moon is depending  on something; the moon is depending  on the sun's light in order to reflect  even this coolness that we enjoy.
"So, mind is like this moon and mind's light  is like this moonlight."
"It also can only reflect, also,"
"Hm? the energy that's coming  from the sun-self, it's like that."
And the light of the sun and the sun are one.
Harmony.
"Like the fragrance  of a flower and the flower, they are one, not two separate things."
They are like one.
"But the smell can come,  the flower can come."
"And this one is saying,"
'... that which is  self-effulgent.'
I don't think 'self effulgent' -
I'm not sure  about this term 'effulgent' - somebody can help me?
Effulgent means self-radiating?
Self-radiating.
"Then, if he speaks  about a light which is self-radiating, then it can only be  a metaphor for the Self, not the phenomenon  of light only."
"It must be  some metaphor for Self, because Self is beyond  light and darkness."
"In It,  light and darkness manifest, time and space manifest through  the mind and consciousness."
All of these can appear.
"a minus one and in the second equation a two,"
"and on the right-hand side, zero and three."
"You see, the"
"columns of the matrix, the columns of A are here and the"
right-hand side b is there.
And now what is the equation asking
for?
It's asking us to find -- somehow to combine that vector and
this one in the right amounts to get that one.
It's asking us to find
the right linear combination -- this is called a linear combination.
And it's the most fundamental operation in the whole course.
It's a linear combination of the columns.
That's what we're seeing
on the left side.
"Again, I don't want to write down a"
big definition.
You can see what it is.
"There's column one, there's column two."
I multiply by some numbers and I add.
That's a combination --
a linear combination and I want to make those numbers the right numbers
to produce zero three.
Okay.
Now I want to draw a picture
"that, represents what this -- this is algebra."
"What's the geometry, what's the picture that goes with it?"
Okay.
"So again, these vectors have two components,"
so I better draw a picture like that.
So can I put down these columns?
"I'll draw these columns as they are, and then I'll do a combination of"
This is my card as well.
"If you have any questions, you can come and see me."
"If you did not, print out the email on the sublime list, and you want 10 dollars off tonight, it's only for the table."
I apologize for that.
But it's for the table.
So not everybody at the table get this.
"Or no, you know what, I am wrong, I am totally wrong."
It's for two.
"So if you have a group of four people, you will get two of these."
And thank you guys for listening.
I hope you enjoyed it.
-What's happening guys?
"All right, here's the thing."
"If you're a penguin, feel free to dance around and have a good time, but don't f--k around and jump on a sea lion."
Now I don't know what that penguin was thinking or why that sea lion needed to be so melodramatic about the whole thing.
"-Oh, no he didn't."
-But I do know that that penguin is brave as hell.
"Apparently, Happy Feet plus gigantic balls equals a penguin."
"No but this video got a half million views in two weeks but it just goes to show you that even in the animal kingdom, everyone picks on the fat kid."
-Fatty fatty 2x4.
"Wake up, fatass."
-Oh!
-Now I'm honestly not sure why he didn't snatch that penguin up and eat him with a side of Nutella.
"But no, his lazy ass goes right back to sleep."
-[snores]
"-Look at him there, lazy ass."
"""Just five more minutes Mom."""
"Listen if you're a sea lion and you're way too lazy get up and eat a penguin, that's like a whole other level of lazy."
"All right, if you're a straight male, then you probably don't know much about Liza Minnelli."
"All right so here we got some footage of her in an interview and I don't know much about her,"
"I know that she sings, I know that she acts and I also know that I am like in love with her now"
'cause she did this hour-long interview and someone clipped a two-second soundbite from that interview.
So N becomes Y. Your code lights up.
Let's write that down.
"Let's do the next letter, U. U becomes T. Let's do M. And"
I've got H this time.
B. And E is W.
"Notice here, we had Y turn up twice."
And they turned up for two different letters.
"So N became Y, and then later on, E became Y. That's unusual."
The other unusual thing you may notice is that the two E's in Numberphile have turned into two different letters.
"So here, E became Y. But the second E became W."
"Now, this is why the Germans thought they had an unbreakable code."
"Old-fashioned code in the past, pen-and-paper codes that they used to use, if you had the same letter, it would become the same letter in the code."
Enigma is different.
"Probably, each time you did it, you would get a completely different code."
"Now, if we can break this code-- and by we, I mean the"
"Polish, the British, and the Americans-- if we can break this code in World War Il, we'll be able to read those German secret messages, which is what we did."
So let me show you how this machine works.
Let me open up the machine.
So we have three things here at the top.
These things are called rotors.
"And inside those rotors, try and imagine lots of wiring."
And it's all crisscrossed wiring as well.
"Now, if I press a letter, have a look what happens."
The rotors move.
"When this rotor does a full turn, it'll kick the next rotor one place."
"And then, the right-hand rotor keeps going."
"Eventually, the middle rotor does a full turn, and it will kick the left-hand rotor one place."
"So a fast rotor, a middle rotor, and a slow rotor."
"Imagine it like it's hands on a clock, like you've got a minute hand and an hour hand and a second hand."
That's the idea.
"Brilliant machine though this is, all it is, really, is just a circuit."
Here is a battery.
"You guys, we live in this world where sexuality is kind of the center of everything."
At the center of how we think about relationships.
At the center of how we think about pleasures.
The center of how we think about a lot of aspects of our lives.
"And so asexual people are, you know, when I was in high school and middle school,"
"I had no idea how to think about relationships,"
I didn't know what was going on with me.
No one was talking about the fact that-
Star:
"So, you're a young man and you're an asexual and you don't have the same sexual feelings, you feel lost."
Like you're odd man out because nobody's telling you why you're not having the feelings that everyone else is talking about.
David:
No one's telling you that it's okay.
And no one's giving kind of a space and words you can use to talk about it.
Chandra:
You said middle school.
Is that how young you were when you found out?
David:
"Yeah, I was 13, 14 when I realized that, I mean, pretty much what all my friends started being sexual, I was just kind of like, ""All right"
"I know, have no way to figure out what's going on"" [laughter]"
I had no context to understand it.
And so I kind of figured out for myself.
"Well, I'm not experiencing these things."
I must be asexual.
Joy:
"Well, maybe it's repressed sexuality."
"Rather than, you know, that you're just like a normal guy walking around."
Maybe it's repressed because you don't want to face what the sexuality might look like.
Could that be?
Lie down.
[laughter]
David:
Let's say I've got me a set of vectors.
So let me call my set B.
"And let's say I have the vectors v1, v2, all the way through vk."
Now let's say this isn't just any set of vectors.
There's some interesting things about these vectors.
The first thing is that all of these guys have length of 1.
"So we could say the length of vector vi is equal to 1 for i is equal to-- well we could say between 1 and k or i is equal to 1, 2, all the way to k."
All of these guys have length equal 1.
Or another way to say it is that the square of their
lengths are 1.
The square of a vi whose length is equal to 1.
Or vi dot vi is equal to 1 for i is any of these guys.
"Any i can be 1, 2, 3, all the way to k."
So that's the first interesting thing about it.
Let me write it in regular words.
All the vectors in B have length 1.
Or another way to say is that they've all been normalized.
That's another way to say that is that they have all been normalized.
Or they're all unit vectors.
Normalized vectors are vectors that you've made their lengths 1.
You're turned them into unit vectors.
They have all been normalized.
"So that's the first interesting thing about my set, B."
And then the next interesting thing about my set B is that all of the vectors are orthogonal to each other.
"So if you dot it with itself, if you dot a vector with itself, you get length 1."
But if you take a vector and dot it with any other vector-- if you take vi and you were to dot it with vj.
"So if you took v2 and dotted it with v1, it's going to be equal to 0 for i does not equal j."
All of these guys are orthogonal.
Let me write that down.
All of the vectors are orthogonal to each other.
And of course they're not orthogonal to themselves because they all have length 1.
"A French invention, a well-known Ime brand."
"Of course it's a French invention, that is exactly what I want."
How much would you like
Let's say a bagful.
"Thank you, just a moment."
"Excuse me, before I sell you the French invisibility powder, I am obligated to ask you if you know how to use it."
I suppose you ingest it.
-That's correct!
That's not all.
Many people think that all you have to do is ingest the powder and everything will be ok.
"When taking the invisibility powder, or any other medicine, it is important to believe in it."
Do you believe -Of course.
Thank you.
"In that case, here's what you do."
Do you have the patience to listen.
"-Yes, mr apothecary"
"Do the following - ingest a pinch of invisibility powder, kick the big toe of your left foot with the heel of your right foot, and shout in your mind, through the walls!"
"In that instant, you'll be invisible."
You may also walk through walls if you feel like it.
But only in the clothes you're wearing.
"For example, if you turn invisible and steal teamster Ruuskas' hat and run away it is going to look like only the hat is running down the street."
Will I stay invisible then
"Don't worry, Mr Vinski, if you want to become visible again, you just have to do everything in the opposite order."
"Kich the big toe of your right foot with the heel of your left foot and shout in your mind, walls through!"
In that instant you'll go back to normal.
"Yes, I think I got it."
Thank you!
-It's quite simple really.
All great things are simple.
"Excuse me, considering that my shoelace came untied with all this climbing you won't mind if I tie it up."
Of course!
-Thank you!
What happened about scouting that kid I mentioned earlier?
It's me.
Did you think about what I said last time?
I want to know first why you put forth those conditions?
I thought you told me to tell you what I wanted.
"If you interfere in my private life, I can't work with you."
Are you calculating which of the two will be more profitable?
I have to leave as I have an appointment.
I will call you back.
"Fine, do that."
But I can't wait long.
"As you know, there are many places that want me."
Call me soon.
President.
What is it?
Doctor Cho called several times.
It's Kang Hwi's examination results.
He asked me to give them to you directly.
"Alright, you may leave."
What do you mean blind?
His eye...
Are you saying that he is going to become blind?
Yes.
"Depending on the degree of damage to his optical nerves, he may be able to maintain a very slight vision."
"However, even that is hard to guarantee."
What about the treatment method?
"If the optical nerves become damaged, it is impossible to recover."
There is no special treatment as of now.
"In the case of Kang Hwi, the rate of progress is very fast."
Probably it is because of the characteristics of the work.
"Fatigue and stress are problems,  but strong lights are also fatal. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; President, only you will suffer like this. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I can't wait long. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;It is an important time now! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; Make sure not to harm the company's image and make thorough preparations. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; There is no treatment."
"Look for a plane ticket, the quickest one."
You do not eat meat?
"Where do you get your protein from?"""
"Like all of a sudden, ""Holy shit, it's all of a sudden dawned on me,"
I have been without protein in the last 8 years.
"Let 's go to McDonalds and get a Big Mac!"""
"Like, I am about to fall down or something."
Or pass out.
Have you ever heard of somebody in the U.S. suffering from a lack of protein and going to the hospital?
It's unheard of.
"It's funny, even dealing with kids, I have a kid say,"
"""I tried to go vegan for a day, and I got really sick."""
What?
It's like people they know somebody who is vegan who is sick.
Really?
I know tons of meat eaters who are sick.
"Yes, you can be an unhealthy vegan."
"What I am telling you is it does not matter if you are eating meat milk, dairy and fish or you are eating a plant based diet, you should know what you putting into your body."
"You should know how many grams of protein you are getting the amount of iron, calcium that you are getting."
"By the way, people say omega-3 from fish."
"You can get that from the seeds, the nuts."
You can get that from other things.
Flax seed is a very good example.
Think about this: these are the largest and strongest land animals on Earth.
What does their diet consists of?
Plants!
"You're in good company, if you're only eating plants."
"And what is so ironic about this is that the largest and strongest land animals not only do they just eat a plant based diet, they also live the longest."
This animal can live to 70 years.
"They can live to about 50 to 60 years, the gorilla about 50 years in the wild."
And their diet consists of nothing but plants.
Are you going to tell any of them they are missing out on protein?
This animal has 10 times the upper body strength of the average male adult.
Thank you.
[APPLAUSE]
AUDlENCE:
Hi.
I have a question about lining stuff up.
"So in Android, I would try to put an image next to a text view, and then there would be this little bit of space from the top of the text view until the text actually shows up, so it does not line up."
"The top of the image does not line up with my text, and it bothers me."
"I try to fix it, but there doesn't seem to be a way to fix it."
Should I even try?
CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
Yes.
Please try.
"I am reminded again and again that that's a little bit difficult right now because the reality is top of the text as we perceive it is the top of the caps, it's usually the place where we want to measure from."
"And in this case in a lot of the systems, it measures from the clipping bounds."
"So measuring from the very top of the text, if you're building these kinds of systems, measuring from the cap height and the baseline is where you want to measure from."
"So you may have to do some kind of-- people always hate negative margins, or I don't know how to technically achieve it."
AUDlENCE:
"I mean, I guess the next question is, if I decided to do it, how do I figure out, what is the amount to shift for my font?"
Is there a computational way to do it?
"I don't want to just trial and error, one pixel, two pixel, I do it until it lines up."
CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
Yeah.
We can talk a little bit after.
ALEX FAABORG:
It's an important limitation.
CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
"Em height times 0.23, I think."
ALEX FAABORG:
But thank you for trying to line it up.
That's great.
AUDlENCE:
"This is something I've been really curious ever since Google started rolling out the new design, because in"
I'm going to have to get my calculator out.
So it's going to be 1 minus 4.2 squared plus 2 minus 4.2 squared plus 3 minus 4.2 squared plus 8 minus 4.2 squared plus 7 minus 4.2 squared.
And it's going to be all of that-- I know it looks a little bit funny-- divided by the number of data points we have-- divided by 5.
So let me take the calculator out.
All right.
Here we go.
Actually maybe I should have used the graphing calculator that I have.
Let me see if I can get this thing-- if I could get this.
There you go.
"Yeah, I think the graphing one will be better because"
I can see everything that I'm writing.
"OK, so let me clear this."
"So I want to take 1 minus 4.2 squared plus 2 minus 4.2 squared plus 3 minus 4.2 squared plus 8 minus 4.2 squared, where I'm just taking the sum of the squared distances from the mean squared, one more, plus 7 minus 4.2 squared."
So that's the sum.
The sum is 38.8.
So the numerator is going to be equal to 38.8 divided by 5.
"So this is the sum of the squared distances, right?"
Each of these-- just so you can relate to the formula-- each of that is xi minus the mean squared.
And so if we take the sum of all of them-- this numerator is the sum of each of the xi minus the mean squared from i equals 1 to n.
And that ended up to be 38.8.
And I just calculated like that.
"I just took each to the data points minus the mean squared, add them all up, and I got 38.8."
And I went and divided by n which is 5.
So this n up here is actually also 5.
Right?
And so 38.8 divided by 5 is 7.76.
So the variance-- let me scroll down a little bit-- the variance is equal to 7.76.
"Now if this was a sample of a larger distribution, if this was a sample-- if the 1, 2, 3, 8, and 7, weren't the population-- if it was a sample from a larger population, instead of dividing by 5 we would have divided by 4."
"And we would have gotten the variance as 38.8 divided by n minus 1, which is divided by 4."
So then we would have gotten the variance-- we would have gotten the sample variance 9.7 if you divided by n minus 1 instead of n.
"But anyway, don't worry about that right now."
That's just a change of n.
And I saw something lying on the sidewalk.
*It was a gold locket... *
*... with the initials E. C.B.* *engraved on it. *
My middle name is Christine.
Erin Christine Bruner.
"And of all the people walking by that day, I found that locket."
What are the chances of that?
"I don't know, maybe it was a sign."
Or maybe it was just some incredible coincidence.
"But it made me feel... ...like no matter what mistakes I've made in the past... ...at that moment, I was exactly where I was meant to be."
Like I was on the right path.
You sound more like a mystic than an agnostic.
Are you wearing the locket now?
No.
You should.
The archdiocese doesn't want you to testify.
They're just afraid that I'll embarrass them.
Testify to some medieval-sounding supernatural nonsense.
They're expecting me to talk you out of it.
I've just decided I'm not even gonna try.
Why not?
If the archdiocese wants to avoid embarrassment... ...they need you to walk out of here a free man.
I believe a jury will find you sincere and credible... ...and when Dr. Cartwright corroborates your testimony... ...and refutes the prosecution's medical arguments... ...we'll get an acquittal.
And everyone will thank me for it.
Emily!
God help me.
"Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, so help you God?"
I do.
"Father Moore, before you could perform the exorcism... ...you had to get the sanction of the Church, correct?"
"Yes, on October the 27th of last year... ...I presented my assessment and recommendation to the archbishop... ...and he authorized the exorcism that day before I left the office."
Tell us what happened that night.
I drove home.
"And when I add them, I get 0."
"That must mean that a plus minus b is equal to 0, or that a is equal to b, that we're dealing with the same number."
"We're essentially dealing with the same number, the negatives of each other."
So what can it be?
"Well, if we're doing the same number and they're negatives of each other, 64 is exactly 8 squared."
"But it's negative 64, so maybe we're dealing with one negative 8, and we're dealing with one positive 8."
"And if we add those two together, we do indeed get to 0."
So this will be x minus 8 times x plus 8.
Now you don't always have to go through this process I did here.
"You might already remember that if I have a plus b times a minus b, that that's equal to a squared minus b squared."
"So if you see something that fits the pattern, a squared minus b squared, you could immediately say, oh, that's going to be a plus b-- a is x, b is 8-- times a minus b."
Let's do a couple more of just general problems.
I won't tell you what type these are going to be.
Let me switch colors.
It's getting monotonous.
Let's say we have x squared minus 24x plus 144 is equal to 0.
"Well, 144 is conspicuously 12 squared."
And this is conspicuously 2 times negative 12.
Or this is conspicuously negative 12 squared.
So this is negative 12 times negative 12.
This is negative 12 plus negative 12.
"So this expression can be rewritten as x minus 12 times x minus 12, or x minus 12 squared."
We're going to set that equal to 0.
This is going to be 0 when x minus 12 is equal to 0.
"You can say either of these could be equal to 0, but they're the same thing."
Add 12 to both sides of that equation and you get x is equal to 12.
"And I just realized, this problem up here, I factored it, but I didn't actually solve the equation."
So this has to be equal to 0.
Let's take a step back to this equation up here.
And the only way that this thing over here will be 0 is if either x minus 8 is equal to 0 or x plus 8 is equal to 0.
So add 8 to both sides of this.
You get x could be equal to 8.
And the trouble is the toilet was about 20 meters outside the hall.
[Some laughter].
In the darkness.
"So this poor little, you can imagine what he felt like, he had the pain in his bladder against the fear of that ghost getting him."
So he made a run for it - desperation.
"He ran and he got to the toilet, locked the door."
He'd only been in that toilet for about a few minutes when he heard the steps.
[Laughter].
And it came right to the toilet cubicle he was in and started scratching.
Can you get a scratch..?
[Scratches tissue box].
I tried to get some special effects.. for the tape
[Laughter].
A scratch at the door..and this poor little novice didn't come out of that toilet cubicle for about 3 hours.
[Laughter].
And when he came out he was telling us - the ghost came to get him!
The ghost!
"And he heard it, he heard it scratching."
Another monk saw that ghost..
You know what it was?
It was a civet cat.
Like a possum.
Those of you who've been to Asia know they've got squat toilets.
"The toilets are actually on the floor, and that little possum, civet cat, every evening he would go into that toilet cubicle to get some water to drink from the toilet bowl."
That was his drinking place.
And so that evening all that happened was this little possum walked to that toilet and was scratching the door
"- ""please let me in, I'm thirsty""."
[Laughter].
"But that little novice [laughs], he was a ghost coming to get me!"
"And you can actually see how because of wrong thinking, and because there was a funeral that day, thinking all day, thinking all evening, and what was just a little jungle cat, just coming for a drink, he thought it was a ghost and he was in that toilet for about 3 or 4 hours - poor little novice."
Now what about you?
What do you get afraid of?
"If you are at 40 and you are imagined you are at 40, point number 40, the last PMT or C is $10,000, so at time 40, it's exactly ten, but when you look back if you were to, you have to carry past money amounts you've invested as earning money, which is good news for you, right?"
And it's earning how much?
"Eight percent and let me, let me tell you, that's not bad at all, aleight."
And we'll talk about that when we talk about risk and return in a second.
"So, do you understand the nature of the beast?"
The beast is not easy.
"It's not easy, it's like doing 39 future values and adding them up, right?"
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to now shift to using a calculator.
"Okay, Okay, so, if you notice I am on the top panel and I am going to use the formula of PMT."
"Remember, whatever you don't know, you type in here."
"So, that's yeah, PMT, alright."
"And the one thing, you have to do before you do PMT and not get excited like PM, Mr. Hyper, you have to put equal sign so that, otherwise, you will get all kinds of garbage."
"Okay, you open it up."
What is the first number that shows up?
The first number that shows up is the rate of return and we know how much are we earning.
We earning 0.08.
"Again, emphasizing this."
The only reason I'm using Excel right now is what?
"Simply, because the calculation is very difficult."
But I've explained to you what's going on.
"You're doing 40 going forwards, but actually only 39."
Because the first one is zero and the last one is just itself.
"So, so that's why, that's it, okay?"
"So, you put a comma, and what's the next one?"
40.
"Number of periods, right?"
"And, actually let me just back track a"
little bit.
"The thing that we want to figure out is FV, so put an FV and now I want rate 0.08."
You see what I was doing we will do next time.
"So, the number of periods is 40 and in this case, I know my PMT and my PMT is $ten, 000, right?"
"And what is PV, don't worry about it, it's not in there and just hit, okay?"
"Now, let's emulate some waveform debugging."
The question here is in which of these cycles is the protocol being violated?
"Remember, the packet starts when the valid signal goes high."
It gets interrupted by the suspend signal.
"And then, the packet ends, when the valid goes low and the parity byte gets transmitted."
We are only
looking at the control signal here.
Please go ahead and check off the cycles from one to seven.
Which one of these is a protocol violation?
Do you remember what you were thinking about when you were doing your performance?
It's nerve-wrecking.

First show we did here.

Somebody had suggested that maybe we wouldn't be a real band unless we played live.
We must do it now.
This was a moment to actually see if we could put off any kind of existence.
BE ACTUAL INSTEAD OF VlRTUAL.
"I was over there and I had this big, fat white speaker and you could see my showbusiness in a nice, big white speakerhead."
And I had the laptop.
I had to put it on my feet for it not to be seen.
We're not really playing with a laptop.
"It kind of felt like a weird kind of karaoke gig, didn't it?"
"- A little bit, yeah."
- Risky karaoke.
We had our friends and stuff in the audience.
It was definitely full to the back cause it was a small venue.
Those were the day when performing was the scary experience where I kind of escape from my body. to get me through the gig and then would come out the other side:
"""Oh!"
Did we do it?
You just find the root of P and the root of Q and if you check if they're equal.
And then the union operation is simply find the two roots I and then set the idea the first one could be the second one.
"Actually less code than for Quick Find, no fore loops."
There's this one wild loop that we have to worry about a little bit.
But that's a quick and elegant implementation of code to solve the dynamic connectivity problem called
Quick-union.
So now we're going to have to look at can this code be effective for
large problems?
Well unfortunately Quick-union is faster but it's also too slow.
"And it's a little different kind of too slow then for Quick Find, there's times when it could be fast, but there's also times when it could be too slow."
And the defect for Quick-union is that the trees can get too tall.
Which would mean that the find operation would be too expensive.
You could wind up with a long skinny tree.
Of each object just pointing to next and then to do a find operation for object at the bottom would involve going all the way through the tree.
Costing involving in the ray axises just to do the find operation and that's going to be too slow if you have a lot of operations.
"Oh, Opalescence."
Can you just picture it?
"Moi, stepping up in astounding new gown at the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot!"
"Why, yes!"
I did make it myself.
Thank you so much for asking.
"Oh, Opal, of course you can help me."
Thank you.
What's that?
You wanna help me more!
"Oh, aren't you the sweetest thing?"
Careful now.
Don't move.
This shouldn't take long at all.
"Howdy, Rarity?"
Shh...
Can't you see Rarity is trying to concentrate?
"Hi i'm Samantha Atwell i'm a junior Social Science Education major from Olathe, Kansas."
The reason why
"I chose ESU is because being an education major, ESU is one of the top four schools in the country for education."
"Being empowered by E means a lot to me, I've been involved in alot of different organizations, meeting alot of friends have helped me to be empowered by E. Some of the things that i absolutely love to do are to scrap book and to take pictures, so at events on campus you'll see me with my camera at all times."
One thing I would advise new students when they come here is to get involved on campus we have a lot of organizations here and by getting involved you get to meet new people really quickly and when you graduate you'll have friends from those organizations.
.
Now here's the question.
Does it really matter.
Why am I making a big fuss about this?
"Whether use it two norm or a one norm, right?"
Because you know what's wrong with using the two norm.
"There is no problem, right?"
"There isn't, but at least from the surface, there would be any problem with using a one norm too."
"Okay,"
let me show you the difference.
"Today in class, you're gonna see it."
Okay.
So what
"I'm gonna do is take this data that I showed up here and we're gonna try to do an L two fit and an L one fit, and you're gonna see what happens."
"Alright, so there is our data we're gonna work with and we would like to put a nice line through that."
Okay.
"So, how do we do this."
"Well, what we gonna do is use what's called."
The
F means Search Command.
"Cuz, we find to do is minimize this a quantity."
Right.
"So, sorry."
We're trying to minimize this.
Right?
This is the idea.
When you do a
"You know, just a normal day."
"About 9:30, the aide came in from the college class and said that Alex had not made it to school and wanted to know if she was supposed to be there that day."
"Of course, she was."
"She would just never answer her phone, so I went and told the office that I needed to go find her."
"But, I knew where she was, and I knew what had happened."
"Just in my heart, I knew."
She had taken a back road to school that morning.
"She wasn't supposed to take it, because it was a dangerous road."
"And that's where I found her truck, out in the field."
[Music]
"The doctors had come in the second time and told us that they didn't think Alex would make it - that they'd lost her several times, and they needed to know what we wanted to do."
And my husband and I had to make the decision to let her go.
We were out in the hall waiting for them to get her cleaned up so we could go see her one last time.
[Music]
I think everything about my life changed.
"For a long time, it was hard to laugh, to really be joyfully happy."
"There are times when Katrina and I would be out doing stuff, and I would feel like I needed to text Alex and tell her what was going on, because I knew she would like it."
And then I would remember I couldn't tell her.
I was supposed to be able to go visit her at college right now.
"You know, and embarrass her on campus in front of all of her friends."
I can't do that.
It's just a whole part of my life that's gone now.
[Music]
"She left me a note, oh, probably six or eight months before she had her wreck."
"Just ""Alex hearts you,"" you know, on my windshield with a dry erase marker."
It's still there.
"You know, I can't bring myself to wipe it off."
I look at it every day.
[Music]
"After Alex died, and we went home, I got on the internet to check her phone records."
"And my husband came up and he goes, ""What are you doing?"""
"And I said, ""I want to know if she was texting and driving."""
The testing shows that Nathan excels at visual and spatial perceptions.
Fantastic.
What I would like you to do next is write the alphabet for me from A to Z and join all the letters together as if the whole alphabet was one long word.
And
"I'm going to time you to see how long it takes you, OK?"
"Ready, go."
Along with his tally sheet of strengths there are significant weaknesses.
M-- I forgot how to do one letter.
Were you forgetting how to make the letter or were you forgetting which letter came next?
Forgetting how to write it.
"Yeah, how to write it."
So you knew what letter you wanted to write?
And could you picture it in your mind?
I could picture it in my mind but I just couldn't--
Couldn't remember the procedure for making that letter?
So let me give you some others now and see how you do.
Dr. Levine now knows something vital.
Nathan knows what the letter K looks like.
But it's simply too much work to write it down.
Kids like this have what is known as an output problem.
These are kids for whom work is too much work.
Effort is too much effort.
And they sit down to do something and you'd think they'd have to climb the
Matterhorn.
And these same kids tantalize everyone because their intake is so good.
They're so good at understanding things.
They're so good at analyzing.
"Often, they're very creative."
A lot of times they're a wellspring of phenomenal ideas.
"But to be productive, to get some output, to be efficient in your output, is sort of out of the question."
"Nathan, do you see only designs here?"
It's as if within the mind of the child with a learning problem there are three clocks.
planes inside nine-dimensional space that we have to work with eventually.
"For now, let's stay with a nice case where the matrices work,"
we can get every right-hand side b and here we see how to
do it with columns.
Okay.
There was one step which I
realized I was saying in words that I now want to write in letters.
"Because I'm coming back to the matrix form of the equation,"
so let me write it here.
"The matrix form of my equation,"
of my system is some matrix A times some vector x equals some right-hand
side b.
Okay.
So this is a multiplication.
A times x.
"Matrix times vector, and I just want to say how do you"
multiply a matrix by a vector?
"Okay, so I'm just going to create a"
matrix -- let me take two five one three --
"and let me take a vector x to be, say, 1and 2."
How do I multiply a
matrix by a vector?
But just think a little bit about
matrix notation and how to do that in multiplication.
So let me say how I multiply a matrix by a vector.
"Actually, there are two ways to do it."
Let me tell you my favorite way.
It's columns again.
It's a column at a time.
"For me, this matrix multiplication says I take one of that column and"
two of that column and add.
So this is the way I would think of
I want you to try it.
"If you haven't tried this, go to Publix, Whole Foods, and get all this food at Publix and Whole Foods."
It is really amazing.
"If you try it out on your family, you tell them it's meat,"
I'd love to see the response they give.
It really is good stuff.
"And remember, all meat, dairy and egg products go through a process."
It doesn't just magically form.
"In this case, the process involves killing, cooking, pasteurization, refrigeration, freezing, and we can not forget the all important seasoning."
"I remember going to McDonald's as a child, and I didn't just get a slab of meat."
"A slab of meat had herbs and spices put into it, was put on the grill, cooked, and then it came to me with a bun,"
"lettuce, tomatoes, ketchup, mustard and onions."
And a pickle.
What all those things are made of?
Plants
"We put condiments, spice and herbs on the meat to make it taste better, in fact, what would meat be without plants?"
It would just be a dead animal.
Would be a carcass on your plate.
It would be no different from road kill.
"So the word of the day is ""Vegan""."
"A vegan is somebody who chooses not to eat any meat, dairy, eggs or fish."
"And again, how is this extreme?"
How is it extreme not to be drinking the milk of any other species?
How is it extreme not to be eating hen periods?
How is it extreme not to be participating in a system that unnecessarily kills animals?
"A lot of kids say, even after all this,they are still like"
"""What do I eat as vegan""?"
"Now, all these products are vegan."
"There is no meat, no dairy, no eggs."
But this is all crap.
This is unhealthy.
This is the junk food vegan.
That's one way to think about it.
"But there are other ways which would describe the same quantity, right?"
"I could have divided the cake into six pieces, and picked two of those pieces."
Right?
"So, the one third we normally write one over three, and this thing we might say two parts of six, and we could write two over six, and we see, already, another issue, which is what?"
"We have two different fractions, but they represent the same thing."
Right?
Sorry my microphone is... it really is falling.
Ok.
"So, this brings us to a concept here, which is... ok, well, we have two ways of representing the same thing."
Two ways of representing the same thing.
These two things are in some sense... we want them to be equi... equivalent.
[Laughter].
Equivalent.
Ok?
"So maybe we want to set up a construction that's... where we define fractions in terms of equivalence relations, ok?"
How are we going to do that?
What will the equivalence relation be?
"So, how about this?"
"Let's take any construction like... any picture like this, and if I want the associated fraction,"
I'll think of one over three as an ordered pair.
"So maybe I'll do the following, in the first picture I'm picking one part out of three, and in the second picture I'm picking two parts out of six, and I'll think of these as equivalent ordered pairs."
Ok?
"And to make this a sentence, I might say write that as equivalent ordered pairs, period."
All right?
Ok.
"And then, what I will do, if I can is, once I figure out what all the things that are in the... that are equivalent are, the idea is that these belong to some equivalence class."
That might have lots of other things in it.
Right?
Like ten coma thirty.
Right?
Or a hundred and twenty one coma... why do I torture myself?
"Now, let me first give you a"
little bit of a metaphor and then come back to how this really works in space-time.
Supposing you're just looking at an xy-coordinate system and you have two points in a two-dimensional space.
"So, here's a point and here's a point."
"Now, if you arrange for some kind of coordinate system--here's a coordinate system."
"This is x, this is y--and you ask how far apart these points are."
"Well, you can do that--let's see."
"They're separated in x by this amount here, which we'll call delta [Δ] x."
"And they're separated in y by this amount here, and that's Δ y."
"But of course, those quantities depend on the orientation of your coordinate system."
"If I now take this coordinate system and I shift it like this, now it's going to be totally different."
"Now I'm going to have x look like this and I'm going to have y, Δ y look like that."
So Δ y has gotten a whole lot smaller.
Δ x has gotten a whole lot bigger.
And all I did was twist the coordinate system.
Yeah?
Student:
[Inaudible.]
Professor Charles Bailyn:
"You still get the same distance, thank you very much, that's exactly right."
The distance is the invariant.
"The x-coordinate and the y-coordinate, those vary with the coordinate system, but the distance is the same."
That's exactly the point.
"And so, the quantity--let me summarize this."
"For points on a 2-D space, Δ x varies."
Δ y varies.
"But there is a quantity that is invariant and that is--well, let's call it (Δ x^(2)) + (Δ y^(2)), which is the distance squared, (Δ D^(2))."
And this is invariant.
"It doesn't matter which way you twist things around, that will--that quantity will remain the same."
"So, now, imagine that you've got events in space-time."
So an event in space-time has three spatial coordinates and one time coordinate.
"So, it's basically a point in a four-dimensional space."

Have you ever taken a low-floor bus ?
"Some people will say, ""Yes,"" but other people will say."
"""No."" A few months ago, my grandmother and I took a low-floor bus to go to the library."
Riding a low-floor bus was the first time for me.
My grandmother usually takes a low-floor bus because she has problems with her knees.
It is difficult for her to get on a bus with steps.
"When I was on the low-floor bus, some old people came onto the bus."
"There were no steps on the bus, so they could get on the bus easily."
I thought that the low-floor bus was designed very well for old people.
"Two weeks later, in class, we had a chance to think about life in our city."
"Our teacher said to us, ""In our city, there are many good projects."
These projects make our life better.
"Now I want you to talk about some of the projects."" Then we started talking about them in groups."
"In my group, we talked about the low-floor bus."
"I said, ""The low-floor bus is designed well for old people."""
Everyone in my group looked interested in the low-floor bus.
"One student said, ""I didn't notice that the low-floor bus was so useful for old people."
There are many old people in our city.
"We should have more low-floor buses for them."" Then another student said, ""I don't think the low-floor bus was designed only for old people."
We should get more information about the low-floor bus.
"Lets go to City Hall after school. """
"At City Hall, we talked to a man there and asked him questions about the low-floor bus."
"He said to us, ""The low-floor bus is not only for old people."
"And of course it's heating up as all of this is happening, so my egg, my scrambled egg's gonna cook a lot faster than Amanda's is."
"Since we're using this anyway, I'm going to go ahead and set the warming zone (which we don't have with the induction cooktop)."
"You need to back up 'cause it won't, yeah,"
"What I just did is to set the warming zone, which is this little thing right here, which will keep Amanda's egg warm while I cook mine."
That's one of those conveniences we're about to give up.
Okay.
"Now Amanda's egg is done, and here's mine already mixed up."
[sound of sizzling oil in pan]
That's more like the temperature you'd want to have.
You can hear it bubbling and sizzling.
Note:
4 minutes 46 seconds so far . . .
This one's gonna cook nice and fast.
It's had time to warm up now.
Now it won't be long before I'll be able to turn this off.
So we'll figure that out.
"Probably after I flip it one time, we'll be able to turn the radiant element off, knowing that the rest of it will cook by itself okay."
"Yeah, I think I feel safe now to go ahead and turn it back off."
Note:
Power off at 6 minutes 16 seconds.
"So whatever time I just turned it off, that's the time elapsed for that radiant element."
Then we'll just let that sit in the pan and finish cooking.
And then the next time we do this we'll use the induction cooktop.
"A equals 1, b equals 5 and c equals 6."
Since we should have ax squared plus bx plus c.
"Equals 0, of course."
"Do you remember that pink dress I bought, with green flowers?"
"Well, last week I wore it at work and everyone went"
"""Alex, it's gorgeous, you look beautiful in it!"" and all"
"Brigitte was green with envy, you see."
"The day after, she comes to work with the same dress!"
That bitch!
"So, what have I given you?"
I have given you everything you need.
"I have given you PMT, RC, which is 10,000."
I've given you number of years
"left for you to retire, 40, and I've given you an interest rate that you're likely to earn on your portfolio, which means, where you put your money."
"A bank, whatever."
We'll talk about that in a second.
"But let's just focus on this, and try to do this problem."
"I hope you've been listening to me, and I hope you've been paying attention."
"Because if you pay attention to a problem, it gets to be a little intense."
And I'll do the problems with you.
"And I have promised myself, today, I'll spend a"
lot of time just doing problems with you because that's how you learn.
"And I, another piece of advise."
"I've given you textbooks to read, that you can go, get and read."
They can be second hand.
"They can be, whatever."
The fundamental principles of Finance have been known since we were in the cave.
"So, it's a, it's a, just remember that what you're trying to do is focus on the fundamentals."
"So, read whatever you want if the video doesn't satisfy your curiosity."
But the video is trying to be self-sufficient.
"So, let's do this, let's now start doing the problem."
"And what I'm going to do is I'm going to do two problems for future value, two problems for present value."
But I'll take breaks with you.
"So, I'll let you know that maybe it's time to take some time off."
"Get some coffee, go jog around the apartment building where you live, or talk to your friend, or watch a video on"
"YouTube, you know, why not?"
Okay.
So let's get started.
I'm going to draw a timeline right here.
"You can use the box I gave you or you can use, I prefer this."
And how many years?
Oh! -- it's trick.
It's a gimmick to crawl into a corner and wait there until somebody comes to your rescue.
I'm admitting it.
I know what I'm doing.
I'm not being phony.
I'm not pretending I'm so brave.
I resent that.
"I feel like you're saying, unless I come out openly and stand on my own"
I'm not a phony.
Bologna!
I'm just as real sitting in that corner as I am out here all by myself.
But you're not sitting in that corner.
"Well, I'm not now."
We're on problem 27.
"They tell us if i is equal to the square root of minus 1, then what is 4 times i-- that's an i-- times 6 times i?"
"Well, multiplication is associative."
You can switch the order around.
"So this is the same thing as 4 times 6 times i times i, or the same thing as 24 times i squared, right?"
"If we square both sides of this, you get i squared is equal to negative 1."
So this is 24 times negative 1.
"So this is minus 24, which is choice C."
"Next problem, 28."
They want to know what an equivalent form of 3 plus i is.
"A lot of times, people don't like either when you have a square root in the denominator or they don't like it when you have an a complex number in the denominator."
A complex number is just something that has part real and part imaginary.
So the way you can do it with this case is you multiply times the conjugate of this number.
"I know that sounds like a fancy word, but all it means is you take the opposite of the imaginary part."
So what's the conjugate?
"Remember, the only way you cannot change a fraction is if you multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same thing, because then you're multiplying by 1."
So what's the conjugate of this?
The conjugate of 3 plus i is 3 minus i.
I never take any cold showers for example.
And I cannot do all these nice exercises.
But I want to ask you something:  do you like organic food?
Can you raise your hand who likes organic food?
"Yeah, you are the problem."
"Because, every morning I fall into deep depression for ten seconds."
"Because, I sit on the toilet- (Straining sounds) and then, basically, I'll show you what it means."
I make excrement.
Like a baby.
And that's what you do as well.
But isn't it amazing?
"That's not one organic label which allows, my excrements are included, not one, whatever you do when- (Strains) never allows me to be involved."
And that's a problem.
"So, we are in deep shit, because we don't respect shit."
(Laughter)
"We can do a lot of innovations, we can look at things, and make them differently."
We can reduce our ecologic footprint.
"For example, people say,"
"""Please protect the environment; don't make so much waste."""
"Please protect the environment, don't use so much water;"
"""Please protect the environment; don't use your car so often."""
"So this is what we're calling ""environmental protection""."
When we destroy a little less.
"That's the same as if you say, ""Please, protect your child; beat your child only three times, instead of five times."""
We think we protect when we destroy less.
"But it's not protecting, it's only minimizing the destruction."
And this is where we are.
"We make waste all over the planet, and it looks crazy."
Why can't we make a different thing?
Why can't we make a footprint which is beneficial?
But this is what we do.
We try to be less bad.
Ok.
[Audience member]
How do you select text using the keyboard?
[Panelist]
"Um, I was alluding to that a little bit earlier."
"You select text by holding down, ah, the, I think Command A, will select all the text."
"Ah, command...."
[Other panelist]
I think it's Shift.
[Panelist answering question]
Shift.
I'm sorry.
"Yeah, if you hold down the Shift key."
"And then use, ah, either the Arrow keys, or the Option left and right arrows, you can select by character or word."
But you use the Shift key in the same way that you would in Windows.
"Um, You're holding down the Shift key and left and right arrow is going to select a character at a time."
And then Shift Command left and right arrow for example would allow you to select a word at a time.
"And then you would use of course your Command X, Command C, Command V, commands to either cut, copy, and then paste that selected text."
"Obviously, I'm not going to get into that demonstrated at the moment."
I can't even fix a misspelled word here.
"So, I don't want to, I don't want to press my luck here."
"Again, but you know that shows how I use it."
I do a lot of typing in meetings.
"And I just send raw text with loaded with mistakes right to um, there's a way to do that in email."
It goes to my email box as a text file--right in the email message.
"And then I can save it down, and then bring it into Notepad or Edsharp which I use a lot, or even Word if you want."
And then I just do most of my editing right on the PC itself.
"So, I don't do a lot of selecting of text on the i device, but you certainly can do it, and it does work."
[Other panelist]
"I've done it, and it does work very well."
[First panelist]
I should let you do that part.
-Get out of the dryer.
[laughter continues]
"-You know, when I wash my bitches, I make sure to dry them on medium heat."
"And I always make sure to throw in a dryer sheet,"
"'cause, you know, you don't want your bitches to get too clingy."
Why was that chick in the dryer anyway?
Was this a dare of some sort?
"Either way, this got about 100,000 views in over a month."
"If you notice when they pull her out, it looks like the dryer is giving birth to Snooki."
"And props to the guy who uploaded this footage, because you know, when your friend gets stuck in the dryer, your immediate reaction should be to be to pull out your cell phone and film it,"
'cause that's what friends are for.
I also noticed that one dude took full advantage of the situation and was like touching her ass.
"Now, I'm not condoning that, I'm just saying it happened."
"You know, I'd say this video deserves more than 100,000 views."
As long as you aren't watching it like...
"""Oh, s--t."
"That looks like a good idea."""
"Yeah, stay out of the dryer guys."
"Your dirty ass will leave all kinds of s--t in the lint trays. all right, this last video, I didn't want to cover it, 'cause it's kind of dumb, but admittedly, it's got over 8,000,000 views in four days."
Geezus.
"And I don't know why, but maybe you'll think it's funny."
"So there's this Chicago news show, and they're trying to get the destruction of this bridge live on film for their show."
"So they're live and they wait and they wait and they wait and they wait but the bridge doesn't blow up, so they cut away for a second."
-When we did the live remote of the guy dressed as a taco parachuting out of a plane into the plastic pool of salsa.
"-While we're stalling, go ahead and show the picture, but today, as we get going..."
-Are you kidding me?
Who did that?
-Wow!
-Are you kidding?
"-Yeah, they missed it."
"Yeah, fayul."
"See that's my new thing, it's not my new thing."
"Next, position yourself behind her."
It's not the time yet.
(Queen Mother) It's not time yet.
It's not the time yet.
It's not the time yet.
You can get a son only by finish together.
It's not the time yet.
You can get a son only by finish together.
(Queen Mother) You can get a son only by finish together.
You can get a son only by finish together.
You can get a son only by finish together.
"It is time to head to the bed chamber, now."
"You Majesty, if the Queen Mother finds out about this ..."
What has happened?
I couldn't even ask because of the leery mood in the royal kitchen.
I don't know why but every one's avoiding me.
"No matter what, we need to find the head chef."
Your Highness.
Do you know something?
Tell me.
It's just ... if she isn't dead...
I once heard when eunuchs were talking of a place ...
"From the basement corridor of the main building, past the  workers area, there is a passage to a lower floor entrance"
The place has no daylight and dust snows down all day ...
"There are people who study psychology,whoever studies  Pirkei Avot in depth understands the depths of a person's soul on an amazing level."
There is a lecture series on the Hidabroot website about Pirkei Avot and people tell me how much  it benefits them when they study the wisdom of Chazal in  Pirkei Avot.
In general you know that Torah study enhances your knowledge.
"If a person goes to a lecture for a few months,he feels a change."
"In fact it says abut our Torah that if you ""turn it and turn it you'll find everything in it"" Just like a box that has all kinds of objects in it,if you turn it you'll find everything in it."
Same for the Torah.Whatever you  want you can find.
"For example,when a person learns  Pirkei Avot it's as if he took a course in psychology.He learns""He who is rich is happy with his lot"""
"""He who is mighty,conquers his evil inclination"""
"Roller skates, reservoirs, anything."
And they will go break that in your home.
"If people have access to the necessities of life, they don't kill, they don't steal, if they are educated properly also."
"Now, for the people that are afraid that there is a bunch of scientists, you would work on the area D, all that is bull."
All that is what you get from the television shows.
There is no need to control people.
"None or whatsoever, in an abundant society."
"We don't want people to have houses, and then go out and buy the furniture."
"We think that, like your automobile."
"You don't have to buy seats, it comes with everything."
So we want to mold all that in the house.
"Jacque and Roxanne build models for films they make, to spread the message of The Venus Project."
"So people say, all my buildings are alike."
They are not.
"If you carefully look at them, there is a widest range of variables."
"Some people say, i don't know that i want to live in a dome."
Your brain is in a dome.
You have been living in a dome all your life.
This is how we make our apartments.
"We change the dive, they changes the shape."
And then pressure.
"Moves a composite material forward, then we cut it."
And then this machine lifts it.
"And this machine, in certain improvement onto that."
Do you understand?
"No humans do any work, any kind of work at all."
Except what you would like to do.
"Art, music, play right, travel, scuba diving."
It wont take 7000 or less people to run everything on Earth.
You need everybody anymore.
"With the advent of automation and nanotechnology, we will make machines enabled to do most of the work."
"There is no such thing as Utopia, as the best as you can design up to now."
"No, if we get caught with a cheated item, they're going to delete our avatars without warning."
We have to proceed on our own and in absolute discretion.
"Wait Artheon, you don't get into Vulca that easily."
"It is surrounded by the Lassierra mountains and in this place, there is an evil that never sleep."
"When the mobs see you, they harass you."
"And if somehow we get through this zone, we'll arrive on a devastate and sterile earth,"
"Covered of embers, ashes and dusts."
Even ten thousand players of our level won't handle it.
- It's insane.
"- And if we fail, what will happen ?"
What will happen when the GM will find out that Bandaid help us to rise up our level with a cheated staff given by Tenshirock the hacker ?
They will delete our characters.
"All of them, without distinctions."
"Why are you not listening to me, I told you..."
"Damn woman, did anyone ask you ? it's not like if we care about your opinion !"
"But, I can't believe my own ears."
It's me the boss so...
What kind of organisation it is when everyone does whatever they want ?
The chaos.
Here you see the effect of my evil plan.
"If I give overpowered cheated items to noobs, arguments will start in the groups,"
"The green-eyed monster, the demon of jealousy will tear them apart,"
"And then, bored, disgusted of MMORPG, they will return to the real life."
I'll do it.
I'LL DO IT !!
I'll do it.
I will jump into the Arks fault with the staff.
"If it's the only way to make you stop arguing, so I'll do it for you."
I'll help you carrying your load.
My sword is your's.
OK then.
"Mmm, I won't manage to persuade them right now,"

Gadejuristen - The Danish Street Lawyers
My name is Nanna Gotfredsen and I am a street lawyer in Copenhagen.
We are at the open drug scene right now.
It's just behind the main station in Copenhagen and we have had an open drug scene here for 30 years- 25 or 30 years.
"What we are doing here with our bike is that we are sending out a legal team providing users, homeless people, and outdoor sex workers with legal advice and legal assistance."
It's the package:
"Pump, filter, water, injection needle."
We have several kinds of needles that we can offer.
"If you don't use these, then we have some bigger ones and we also have a pump that is bigger."
But this is what you have in the ordinary set here and also alcohol cleaner.
And this is a J-Key card.
Information for safer injection.
This is a question and then you have the answer on the other side.
There is not doubt that law enforcement cannot prevent people from using drugs.
Using drugs has other reasons than whether it is criminalised or not.
When the police is targeting the open drug scenes you can only make it worse for drug users.
They are fighting so hard to stay alive and we can see that from the constantly high death rate in Denmark
This is our office - The street lawyer.
"Drug users, homeless people and all of them are here with us."
"We can be like 30 or 40 people up here, and so we would like some more space."
Homeless people are having their clothes and things and papers and things like that in the office.
So that's choice D.
"The hard part here, as far as I'm concerned, is just understanding the problem and their diagram."
And then just seeing the pattern that you're just switching the letters.
First you switch the left and the middle letter.
Then you switch the right and the middle letter.
Then you switch the left and the middle letter.
Then you switch the right and the middle letter.
"Until you get back to A, B, C."
Next problem.
White I don't think is colorful enough.
Let me do magenta.
19.
In a set of 11 different numbers-- they're different- which of the following cannot affect the value of the median?
"So it's a set of 11 different numbers, they're different, so let's say it's 1 through 11."
That's 11 different numbers.
"And in this case, what's the median?"
"Well we have 5 on this side, 5-- the median is this, this is the middle number, right?"
6 is the middle number.
"Doubling each number-- well, if you double every number, the median's going to become 12, so that's not right."
"Increasing each number by 10-- once again, if you increase all of these numbers by 10, this number's going to be 16, so you would've changed the median."
Increasing the smallest number only.
"Well, what if you increase the smallest number to,"
"I don't know, 12?"
So then this 12 would go all the way on the other side right?
And then the median would move to 7 because you would have to have 5 below the median and 5 above the median.
So you can increase that smallest number.
"But if you increase it by a large enough amount, it kind of goes into the greater than the median column and then the median would have to shift to the right."
"Try it out, write out the list from 2 to 12, and then the median becomes 7."
"OK, so we know that choice B is not right."
"Choice C, increasing-- oh no, that was choice C-- choice D, decreasing the largest number only-- well, the same argument can apply."
"We could take the 11 and decrease it down to,"
"I don't know, decrease it to 0."
"You can't do better than 100%, right?"
"So now in stage five, we kind of take this a little too far, right?"
So let me actually just make a little bit of space here.
We take this a little bit too far in the sense that our actin is going to slip out all the way over here.
And it's going to be out all the way over here.
"So we've got a huge, huge gap now."
"And, of course, our titin is completely stretched out."
It's about as stretched out as our titin is going to get.
This green titin protein.
"And now the question is, of course, would you get any force?"
And the answer's probably no.
Because the myosins aren't even touching the actins anymore.
"So really, again, you have zero out of 20 myosins at work."
"And of course, that means that then the amount of force would be zero."
So we go back down to zero.
So this is part five.
"So you can see now, as we've gotten longer and longer, things were good for a while, but then they drifted all the way back down."
"And this curve that I'm showing you, this tension-length curve, is now based on exactly what you see on the right."
"It's based completely on the idea that as you stretch things out, the amount of force changes depending on the length of the sarcomere."
[ape sounds]
Meet the relatives
"These are our closest cousins, the great apes."
We like to think we're different.
"But a few million years ago, we were just the same."
"Now, we dominate the planet."
"Somehow we humans have left apes far behind, or have we?"
Through a series of experiments we'll prove that apes are much closer to us than anyone thought.
Startling images reveal that their instant memory is far superior to ours.
Woman:
"""Lettuce."""
Apes can understand hundreds of words.
[mimicking the sound of apes]
"The Engie is set up, all right?"
Don't worry about the Engie.
Machine learning for wed developers or
"Machine learning and You or something along those lines so I note everyone is here, ready to go."
"So yeah, I kind of made this talk as more of an introductory kind of thing."
I suspect if you understood everything in the last talk.
This might bore you.
Mostly because we are not going into numpy and scipy. that kind of stuff.
For the demo we are going to do I want to make sure you don't have to have your FORTRAN compiler set and everything.
We are doing just an overview. meant for web developers who have heard about this kind of stuff and read hacker news regularly and don't see how they can apply it to web applications and that kind of stuff.
"You should know python and data structures, that kind of stuff."
If you are in applied math and a PHD you might find this kind of boring.
"Hopefully we can get into some cool applications of machine learnng and we will be building somthing together, kind of fun."
"If you are following along on you laptop, for the material today all you need is"
"I wrote some set up scripts that will create a virtual environment, get you all the packages and stuff."
Let me break out of this real quick and get you started.
"So if you are on a mac and you can do HomeBrew, do brew install. you can do C compile and C sees it ."
The Natural Language ToolKit is in today and it requires that.
"If you are on Ubuntu, you need the development headers."
Clone the repository at mygethub. cd setup.
There are some shell scripts there.
"If you are on windows, I didn't write anything for you, sorry."
NLTK is a little weird with intstallations.
So let me know if there is a problem with that. so boot strap. download some stuff and you should get some fun stuff.
"Oh yes, Absolutely."
You want ... the font.
"Okay, Sorry I am a little mis set."
Where am I going?
Okay.
Can everyone see yet?
Bigger ? yeah.
Yeah the pail chart what did it fail on?
We saw it as an opportunity to develop a crop locally.
It's really volunteers in of our field.
"If you drive around, it's really easy to see right now."
It's going to be turning yellow.
"You can do down the interstate, 65 miles an hour, and you can pick it out."
Once you see it a couple of times.
So it is easy to see.
It's pretty much everywhere.
It's all across the Midwest.
"It stretches into Canada, down into"
Texas.
It's very widespread.
"It originated, probably, in this country with wheat, as a contaminant of wheat."
And that's probably why you see it so widely dispersed.
So we're not the discoverer of it.
We just saw an opportunity to take that plant and do something with it.
So it has very high oil.
"It is 36 percent oil, in the variety that we're working on."
"It's a very small seed, as you've seen this morning."
And it does dry down.
"It has a lot of good things going on in a crop, that you want right out, as a wild crop."
And usually you have to work to get those things.
It doesn't really seed scatter.
It will after a while.
That is how it gets dispersed.
It is usually several weeks after it's ripe that you'll start to see the seed shatter.
"So it holds on to the seed, so you can get it into the combine and do all the things."
"And so, these things sound all easy when you talk about them but when you work on a new crop, these things aren't easy to get to that point."
So this thing started way ahead of every other new crop that we have ever worked on at the lab.
And you have bear that in mind.
It may take tens of years to get to the point where pennycress started.
"So, Win has an opportunity to really take that and move that forward quite a bit and make some real advancements."
"So this is the width, this is the length."
So L plus W is equal to 8.
What is the perimeter of the shaded region?
Fascinating.
Let's do it step by step.
First we can just figure out what this part of the perimeter is.
"And that's the easiest part, right?"
Because what's the perimeter of the whole circle?
"Well, it's the circumference of the whole circle."
Circumference is equal to 2 pi r.
This is the whole circle we're talking about.
"So that's equal to 2 pi times 6, so that's equal to 12 pi."
"This is the circumference of the whole circle, so the circumference of this arc, of this piece, is going to be 1/4 of that, because it's 1/4 of the whole circle."
"So it's 1/4 of 12 pi, so that's 3 pi."
"Now, what we need to be able to figure out is L and W because if we can figure out L and W, we can figure out everything else about this circle."
"And actually,"
"I'm going to continue this problem in the next video, because I think it might get a little involved, and I don't want you to get too confused."
I'll see you in the next video.
"What's a fuck, lord, music store?"
Hi!
Where's your compact disc departament?
"We don't care CDs, only vinyl."
Only vinyl?
Uau!
What blast to the past
The people's still listen to vinyl records?
I don't know.
"Well, me nice still have..."
I am to interview a patient and I'd like to give you some thumbnail sketch of what
Gestalt therapy stands for.
"The Gestalt therapy works on an equation awareness, equal present time, equal reality."
"In contrast to depth psychology, we try to get hold of the obvious, the whole surface of the situation in which we find ourselves, and to develop the emerging Gestalt, strictly on the I and thou, here and now, phrases."
"Their positions in feet as a function of time in seconds,"
"T of t and H of t respectively, are plotted below."
"So T of t is the position of the tortoise as a function of time, and it's in feet."
H of t is the position of the hare.
What is the meaning of the rate of change of T of t on the interval t is greater than 0 and less than 20?
"So T of t, they were talking about the tortoise here."
"This is the function T of t right over here, this blue line."
And it looks like it's moving at a constant rate of change.
The slope of this line is constant.
So let's see what this rate of change is.
If we start-- so we could even start from the starting position.
"When 1 second goes by, each notch here in the horizontal axis is 1 second."
"You see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5."
"So every time 1 second goes by, it looks like-- and we have to be very careful here."
"At first it looks like, oh, maybe he moves 1 feet."
But we have to be careful about what these notches represent.
"It looks like these notches represent 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 feet."
"So every time 1 second goes by, he moves forward 5 feet."
"Another second goes by, he moves forward 5 feet."
"So it looks like the rate of the tortoise, so I'll say the tortoise rate, the rate of the change of distance with respect to time is 5 feet for every second."
So let's see which of our choices seem to match that.
And that is over the entire interval.
"The interval starts here, this is 0, and 20 is right over here."
"And it looks like we have a constant rate, we have a constant slope."
We have the same inclination of this line the entire time all the way until t is equal to 20.
"So this first choice says the tortoise walks at 5 feet per second the whole time, and this looks right."
Our tortoise has a constant rate of 5 feet per second.
This walks might be an understatement.
"5 feet per second is a pretty good speed, especially for a tortoise."
But we are going to go with that one.
"Now, let's just look at the other ones for fun to see how true they are or see if they could have somehow applied to this problem."
The hare stops moving after 5 seconds.
You can see that's a modern battery in there.
We've converted this.
And this battery is connected to a bulb.
And it lights up.
"It's the most simple thing you can make-- a battery and a bulb, the bulb lights up."
And that's all it is.
The clever bit is the wires of the circuit are inside the rotors.
"So when the wires turn, the battery will connect to a different bulb."
Let's try and see that happen.
"So I'm going to turn the wires, and the battery connects to this bulb."
"Do it again, I'm going to turn the wires, and the battery connects to this bulb."
It changes.
"Do it again, turn the wires, and the battery connects to this bulb."
"And that's why it changes each time, because it has moving parts inside."
"But otherwise, it's just a simple circuit."
I think we need to know how to decode.
"This would be no good if we can't decode our message, so"
let's do that.
"First of all, we're going to take our code here, we need to know what the setting was."
"Now, if you notice, in the little windows, we have three numbers."
"It's like a combination lock, like a bike lock."
"Now, I took a note of what those three numbers were."
"Those three numbers, when we started writing Numberphile, were a 13, 9, and 21."
"So the idea is, you would type in your message, and you would get a code."
"The machine itself doesn't transmit, so you would have to write that code on a piece of paper."
So that piece of paper would be given to the radio operator who would then transmit the message by radio by Morse code.
That would travel miles away.
"So now imagine a second German officer, maybe on a ship somewhere in the ocean, now he's tuning into that radio signal."
He can hear the code.
"It's coming in, and he writes it down."
"Now, this second officer will have an"
Enigma machine as well.
What we're trying to do is take a dead nucleus from an extinct species and put it into a completely different species and expect that to work.
"Well, we had no real reason to expect it would, and we tried hundreds and hundreds of these."
"And just last February, the last time we did these trials,"
I saw a miracle starting to happen.
"What we found was most of these eggs didn't work, but then suddenly, one of them began to divide."
That was so exciting.
And then the egg divided again.
And then again.
"And pretty soon, we had early-stage embryos with hundreds of cells forming those."
"We even DNA-tested some of these cells, and the DNA of the extinct frog is in those cells."
So we're very excited.
This is not a tadpole.
It's not a frog.
"But it's a long way along the journey to producing, or bringing back, an extinct species."
And this is news.
We haven't announced this publicly before.
We're excited.
We've got to get past this point.
"We now want this ball of cells to start to gastrulate, to turn in so that it will produce the other tissues."
It'll go on and produce a tadpole and then a frog.
Watch this space.
I think we're going to have this frog hopping glad to be back in the world again.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
"We haven't done it yet, but keep the applause ready."
The second project I want to talk to you about is the Thylacine Project.
"The thylacine looks a bit, to most people, like a dog, or maybe like a tiger, because it has stripes."
But it's not related to any of those.
It's a marsupial.
"It raised its young in a pouch, like a koala or a kangaroo would do, and it has a long history, a long, fascinating history, that goes back 25 million years."
But it's also a tragic history.
"So, avoid repetition, avoid excess verbiage."
And ...
"Yes, I've used it. ..."
I've written [laugh] editorials about that which I think you've used it.
I've used.
Yes [laugh].
"And Avoid, you know, sometimes people will write a rather long discussion in the introduction of the paper, where it's, really, the introduction should be."
"Brief, and say why you did this study and what you, basically what you what you tried to accomplish."
But leave all the discussion the review of the literature for the discussion section.
"Don't try to, to put too much in the introduction."
Some things are certainly you need some background.
As to why you did this study.
Which may involve citing some previous
"literature, but don't go into detail."
"At that's, in the introduction."
And .
Don't repeat numerical data in the text.
"You know, you'll have a table which has nice, numerical data with odds ratios and so on, and then there's, in the results, saying table one shows the blah, blah, blah and the odds ratio was this and that and, so avoid repeating that."
"We will often ask authors, you know, just describe."
The finding of the table in words.
And they can see.
The reader can see the numerical examples.
"Good, yeah."
So those are my main suggestions.
Those are good tips.
"Yeah, and you know, one of the, the fears I think that comes up often when I'm teaching a course like this."
"And it's already come up in this class is, a lot of scientists will say to me well I, you know, you know, I've been teaching them to write in simple and concise language."
And they'll say well if I simplify it to much I'm gonna dumb down the science.
It's gonna lose precision.
Mm-mm.
And.
So there's this kind of fear that a lot of scientists have.
"This question, that you want to find out."
"Because sometimes, there is so much distortion when you try to focus, that you'll forget the question."
It's like something is zooming in on really what is important.
"And what happens is that, that part of your mind or psyche that's trying to avoid, seeing the truth for what it is."
The mind as you come nearer to identifying the mind will begin to throw stones in the bush.
To trying to get you to look somewhere else.
"So, this will be felt , like a kind of distortion"
"'no, no, I can't cope with it' and all this type of stuff."
"So, write it down."
And hold the question in your consciousness.
And it will begin to burn something.
"You feel, feel it. what will be left is just a sort of spaciousness."
"And intense feeling of presence, just presence, and joy and space."
"Then , in this moment, you re-invite again the question , you see."
"'Now who wants, who wants this picture?'"
'Who wants to fulfill this picture'?
And see what happens then?
It will have no pulling power for you.
"So, this is really the effectiveness of the enquiry."
I want to go over it again for you.
Something is on the mind.
Something is coming up.
"In India sometimes, when it is intense. intensely personal, nothing can trouble you except you personalize it."
"If there is no identity, it has no power."
"You've to somehow spray your scent on whatever it is, to empower it."
You understand what I mean by this.
See Part Three
"The last couple of days, we had heard that Tyler had his head shoved into a wall locker."
They said he was a geek.
My concern is that you were making someone feel so unomfortable that they didn't want to be in school.
I feel kinda nervous on the school bus.
"I like learning, but I have trouble with making friends."
"So, you have to get your own strategies together before you go to make a major purchase."
"Now, something else that the book talks about."
It talks about price comparrison.
And here we are not necessarily talking about a major purchase.
"This can be, I'm going to the store and I'm having dinner and it normally takes two cans of green beans for my family."
"Well I can buy one can, the small can of green beans for $.99."
"So to buy two of them would be $1.98, right? $.98 X 2."
"But, I can buy a larger can, double the size, for $1.50."
Should I buy two small ones or one large one?
"Obviously, you would buy one large one."
"And we make the assumption, because this is how it used to be, that the bigger the quantity the less per ounce or per pound or whatever an item is."
And let me tell you that is not always true.
They got you to thinking that so now they do just the opposite because if you need two cans of green beans for a meal you will buy the big one when maybe the big one is $2.25 and the two little ones are $.99 each.
You are better off buying the two little ones even though you have to open two cans than you are buying the one big one.
If it is twice the volume.
Okay?
"So, how can I do this?"
And I will tell you what I do this in the grocery store all the time.
"It takes a little longer to buy groceries sometimes, but this is what you need to do."
You need to be able to figure the unit price of an item.
"And if you will look on page 190, there is the example."
"To calculate the unit price of an item, divide the cost by the number of units."
"So, if I am trying to figure out how many ounces are in something."
I mean how much an ounce of something costs.
I look at how many ounces are in the can and then I take the price divided by the number of ounces.
"So, if you look at this it says a 64 ounce product costing $8.32."
So you take $8.32 divided by 64 and it tells you the cost per ounce.
Okay?
"So, you need to use that when you go grocery shopping."
Take a calculator.
Use the calculator on your phone!
But sometimes it is cheaper to buy two little cans of green beans than to buy the one big can.
Let's say that this distance between this leg and the book is 1 meter-- or the box.
"Let's say that this distance between the leg and the center of mass is 2 meters, and so this is also 2 meters."
"OK, so we can now set this up as a moment problem."
"So remember, all of the clockwise moments have to equal all of the counterclockwise moments."
So what are all of the clockwise moments?
What are all of the things that want to make the table rotate this way or this way?
"Well, the leg is the only thing keeping it from doing that."
So everything else is essentially a clockwise moment.
"So we have this 100 Newtons, and it is 1 meter away."
Its moment arm distance is 1.
"So these are all the clockwise moments, 100 times 1, right?"
"It's 100 Newtons acting downwards in the clockwise direction, clockwise moment, and it's 1 meter away, plus we have the center of mass at the top of the table, which is 20"
"Newtons, plus 20 Newtons, and that is 2 meters away from our designated axis, so 20 times 2."
"And you might say, well, isn't this leg exerting some force?"
"Well, sure it is, but its distance from our designated axis is zero, so its moment of force is zero."
Even if it is exerting a million pounds or a million
"Newtons, its moment of force, or its torque, would be zero because its moment arm distance is zero, so we can ignore it, which makes things simple."
So those were the only clockwise moments.
And what's the counterclockwise moment?
"Well, that's going to be the force exerted by this leg."
That's what's keeping the whole thing from rotating.
So it's the force of the leg times its distance from our axis.
"Well, this is a total of 4 meters, which we've said here, times 4 meters."
And so we can just solve.
"We get 100 plus 40, so we get 140 is equal to the force of the leg times 4."
So what's 140-- 4 goes into 140 35 times?
My math is not so good.
Is that right?
4 times 30 is 120.
120 plus 20.
So the force of the leg is 35 Newtons upwards.
"And since this isn't moving, we know that the downward force right here must be 35 Newtons."
A really nice algorithm.
"As I said, an example of divide and conquer."
Notice here that it's different than the binary search case.
"We're certainly dividing down, but the combination now actually takes some work."
I'll have to actually figure out how to put them back together.
And that's a general thing you want to keep in mind when you're thinking about designing a divide and conquer kind of algorithm.
"You really want to get the power of dividing things up, but if you end up doing a ton of work at the combination stage, you may not have gained anything."
So you really want to think about that trade off.
"All right, having said that, what's the complexity here?"
"Boy, there's a dumb question, because I've been telling you for the last two lectures the complexity is n log n, but"
let's see if it really is.
What's the complexity here?
"If we think about it, we start off with the problem of size n."
What do we do?
We split it into two problems of size n over 2.
"Those get split each into two problems of size n over 4, and we keep doing that until we get down to a level in this tree where we have only singletons left over."
"Once we're there, we have to do the merge."
Notice what happens here.
We said each of the merge operations was of order n.
But n is different.
Right?
"Down here, I've just got two things to merge, and then"
I've got things of size two to merge and then things of size four to merge.
But notice a trade off.
I have n operations if you like down there of size one.
Up here I have n over two operations of size two.
Up here I've got n over four operations of size four.
So I always have to do a merge of n elements.
How much time does that take?
"Well, we said it, right?"
Where did I put it?
"Right there, order n."
And this is like the average that you're used to taking before you learned any of the statistics stuff.
You add up all the data points and you divide by the number there are.
The sample is the same thing.
We just use a slightly different terminology.
The mean of a sample-- and I'll do it in a different color-- just write it as x with a line on top.
And that's equal to the sum of all the data points in the sample.
So each of the xi in the sample.
But we're serving the sample is something
less than a population.
So you start with the first one still.
And then you go to the lower case n where we assume that
lowercase n is less than the big N.
If this was the same thing then we're actually taking the average or we're taking the mean of the entire population.
And then you divide by the number of data points you added.
You get to n.
"Then we said OK, how far-- this give us the central tendency."
It's one measure of the central tendency.
But what if we wanted to know how good of an indicator this is for the population or for the sample?
"Or, on average, how far are the data points from this mean?"
And that's where we came up with the concept of variance.
And I'll arbitrarily switch colors again.
Variance.
And in a population the variable or the notation for variance is the sigma squared.
This means variance.
And that is equal to-- you take each of the data points.
You find the difference between that and the mean that you calculate up there.
You square it so you get the squared difference.
And then you essentially take the average of all of these.
You take the average of all of these squared distances.
So that's-- so you take the sum from i is equal to 1 to n and you divide it by n.
That's the variance.
And then the variance of a sample mean-- and this was a
Taking apart my syringe.
"I'm going to add this in here, and then I want to turn my stopcock to open it up to the patient."
I can shut off this side port so it doesn't leak out.
And then the patient's head should be elevated a little bit.
You don't want them flat.
"So let's make sure, either raise the head of the bed or the patient can be raised up with some pillows."
Make sure they're not flat.
Okay.
So now I'm ready and I can take my feeding and pour it in here.
Okay?
And then you just want this slightly higher than the patient so that it'll go in but not too fast.
Okay?
"All right, and then I would give whatever my feeding amount was slowly and then after that, I would turn my stopcock again to shut it off so it's off here so it won't leak and then I can come back and do it again."
"Now, once I've been feeding the patient and I'm doing it, if this was my first time, after I check for placement, that's all I had to do."
"If I'm coming back four hours later, to give another bolus feed, I would need to check for residual first, tube placement, check for placement, check residual and then give the feeding."
"I may need to follow it with water per my order, to make sure the line is flushed and also to give the patient free water."
"If the patient's on continuous drip, meaning that they get a continuous feeding over 24 hours, we're going to use a special pump that is designed to be used with the feeding tubes."
And there's a special bag and seth (phonetic) that fits in this special type of pump.
All right?
So we're going to use a special feeding bag.
All right.
And then I'm going to pour my required amount of feeding into the bag.
Close the top.
Okay.
Now this is similar to an IV.
"It has a drip chamber, kind of like an IV does, but to get this IV to run, we have to do something special, to get this tubing to flush."
This part here is stretchy tubing.
And I need to stretch it flat and that allows the drip chamber to fill.
All right?
Okay.
"And then I put, prime my line, just like an IV line, until I get a drop to come out."
There we go.
What's 0.5 times 0.03?
"I'll do it down here just because multiplying decimals seems to be a problem for a lot of people, including myself, many times."
"So what you do, you just multiply the numbers."
5 times 03 or 5 times 3 is 15.
"And then, how many points do we have behind the decimal?"
How many digits behind the decimal?
Let's see.
"We have 1, 2, 3."
"So 1, 2, 3."
We have to add the 0 because we need three spaces behind the decimal point.
So we get the force is equal to 0.015 kilogram meters per second squared.
And this is a Newton.
So the force is equal to 0.015 Newtons.
Let's do another problem.
"And this one's going to be-- and actually, I think you'll find most of the difficult Newton's laws problems or force problems, they're just some combination of making sure you get the units right when we're talking about in one dimension."
"The difficult part is usually getting the units right or just the math, just the algebra."
So if you have trouble with this it's usually because you have to just brush up a little bit on the algebra.
The physics itself is just force equals mass times acceleration as we will see in this problem.
"So let's say that when I apply some force, some particular force, I use this little 0 here."
So I call that force F sub 0.
So this means a particular force.
This is some value.
"When I apply that force to some mass, let's call that m sub 0, I get some acceleration."
I get acceleration a sub 0.
We could've put numbers here.
"We could've said, well, if I apply a force of 10 Newtons to a mass of-- I don't know-- to a mass of let's say 2 kilograms, I have an acceleration of 5 meters per second squared."
But I'm just doing this because this could be any relationship.
"And let's say the problem tells us that when I put another mass with this first mass, so let's say that, you know-- let me draw this diagram."
"So here's my mass, m sub 0."
"When I apply a force of f sub 0 to it, I get an acceleration of a sub 0."
Now the problem tell us when I add another mass-- so let's says I stack it up and we're like in an ice skating ring or something.
"And I stack another mass up here, and let's call this mass m1."
least square you minimize this.
Whether it's the two or the one norm.
"So really that corresponds to, the only thing I really gotta minimize is this."
"This stuff is always the same, so if I can minimize that some, that's all I care about."
"So there's this thing called fminsearch In Matlab, which allows you to just give it an expression, and it will try to minimize, and you give it some initial values, to try to say, hey, try these and then go find me a minimum solution."
'Kay?
"So that's what we're going to use, fminsearch."
All right.
"So, we come into here and here's how it works."
"We want the coefficients, using an L2 fit, the coefficients meaning a and b."
"And want to call the fminsearch, command."
"And want to call a function called line, L2 fit."
"And well we've gotta pass it, or the initial guesses for the values of A and B. I'll just pick one."
"And I'. gonna pass it the data X and Y. The box here is for tolerence settings, just allow you to make it, get more accurate fi, or less accurate fit. the default is ten minus six."
"It's gonna try to get you the minimum, and once it gets, it's, it's an iteration routine, and once you get down to 10-6, it stops, 'kay?"
"So, ther e you go, that's how you do it."
"You send in your, you send in your data, you send in your initial guess for A and B, and what is gonna come out are two numbers, A and B. That, it thinks, so the minimum, give you the minimum values for those things."
"Okay, now we can do this without one by simply changing two:1."
"So we're gonna do two this, we're gonna first call F and then search, and use, yeah, two, minimization, and then we're gonna call F and search."
A one immunization.
"Now, it turns out, it's kinda like the cooking show today."
"Where,"
"like, you know, oh, you put it in the oven for 50 minutes and, you know, all of a sudden, right at that point, they pop one out."
"It's all planned as if, as if it wasn't spontaneous."
"Okay, so we're not going spontaneous today."
"We're going to go get these , they're sitting right there."
"There's one of them and let me get the other one, and then we'll talk about them."
"Where is it L2 fit, okay."
Alright.
"So what are they, what are these subroutines."
"Well, here they are."
They're actually quite simple.
"However, we need those two bubbles to keep the rope, the wire, the cable... whatever it is... in a fixed position."
"So, here is the crane's arm with a hook."
Let's attach it back to the cabin.
Congratulations again.
We have made the crane.
The crane will look much better and have much more use if we put the crane on a base.
"So, let's make a base."
Inflate a balloon
leaving about three inch flat tail.
Twist a chain of four about...two inch size bubbles.
Lock both ends of the chain of the first four bubbles in one lock twist.
The rest of the balloon we split aah...to make four about seven inch size bubbles.
Twist the fifth seven inch bubble.
Lock the free end of the fifth bubble between the first and the second bubbles.
Twist the sixth seven inch bubble.
Lock the free end of the sixth bubble between the second and the third bubble.
Twist the seventh seven inch bubble.
Lock the free end of the seventh bubble between the third and the fourth bubble.
If you properly measured previous bubbles then the rest of the balloon is the eighth seven inch bubble.
It's OK if we make eighth bubble of different size.
Lock the free end of the eighth bubble between the fourth and the first bubble.
Congratulations.
We have made the base for the crane.
Our next step is obvious.
We attach the crane tower to the base.
There are four ends at the bottom of the tower.
We tie each end to the appropriate spot between bubbles of the base.
"Again, if you made a different size eighth bubble of the base, then you want to place the eighth bubble of the base on the front or on the back side of the crane."
"Congratulations, we have made the crane on the base."
Let's just fix all bubbles in proper positions.
The structure of crane base allowed us to convert the crane to sort of a mobile crane.
Simply adjust position of the sides of the base to make two wheels mobile crane.
"At $60 the value of our option is $10, but we paid $10 for it."
"That's our break even, but then we make money after that."
This is from the perspective of the holder.
This is from the perspective of the holder of the call option.
This is the holder of the call option.
What would it look like if you're the writer of the call option?
If your the person selling the right to buy the stock.
"If this person right over here, if the holder has the right to buy at $50, someone must be selling them that right."
Someone must be agreeing to say hey I will essentially sell that to you at that price.
If you're the writer of the foot ... we have the holder in green.
The holder in green.
What if you're the writer?
You're essentially the counter party on that option.
You're the person agreeing to uphold that option.
"If the option never gets exercised, then the writer doesn't have to loose any money."
"If the option does get exercise, then all of a sudden, the writer starts to loose money."
"If the writer doesn't own the stock, and let's say the stock is at $60, this guy, the holder, can exercise his option to buy at $50."
The writer would then have to go buy the stock on the market for $60 and sell it for $50.
They would loose $10.
The writers payoff would look something like this.
Once again it's the mirror image of the payoff of the holder.
"If you think about the profit of the writer, if the option is never exercised, then the holder gets to keep the $10 that they were paid ... that they sold the right for."
"If the option is exercised, and they start to"
"loose money, and their break even once again is at $60."
"Anything below that, then they start to loose more and more money."
Once again these are the mirror images of each other.
If you were to add up these two line it would be break even.
These parties are the ones who are exchanging money between.
If this guys makes $10 this guys loosing $10 or vice versa.

The Mormons tried to set up a settlement at Warren, a site just south of Warsaw. In 1841 Willard Richards moved to Warsaw to oversee the settlement of Warren, but due to the public response to writings by Sharp and other problems, the Mormon settlement was abandoned in 1842. In October 1844, a great gathering was announced in Warsaw. Although it claimed to be a ""wolf hunt,"" people knew that the ""wolves"" to be hunted were the Mormons. When Governor Thomas Ford heard about it, he sent militia troops to disperse the gathering. Most Mormons left the area for Utah in 1846."

"Where gold lies hid, and rubies gleam,"
And fabled wealth no more doth seem
The idle fancy of a dream — Australia!

"From sunny plain and woodland steep,"
And love and joy bright vigils keep;
Where the glad voice of childish glee
Is mingling with the melody
Of nature's hidden minstrelsy — Australia!

"From mountain-top to girdling sea,"
A proud flag waves exultingly;
"And FREEDOM'S sons the banner bear,"

"The word ""individualism"" was originally used by socialists to attack their enemies. They said that individualists were selfish for not supporting socialism. Instead, individualists support people being independent and chasing their own goals. They also believe in having lots of freedoms."
"Collectivists believe that one person is not as important as a group of many people. They often believe people should compromise to make things better for each other instead of just themselves. They also think that letting someone do whatever they want is not good if it hurts lots of other people. Collectivism has many different types. It can mean serving your community, your government, your social class, your race, or some other group."

Green bromeliad frog
"The green bromeliad frog, Jamaican green tree frog, or Wilder's tree frog (""Osteopilus wilderi"") is a frog. It lives in Jamaica. Scientists have seen between 120 and 880 meters above sea level."
The adult male frog is 24.3 to 27.9 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 24.2 to 29.2 mm long. There is no webbed skin on the front feet and a little webbed skin on the back feet. This frog is usually yellow-green in color but it can be red-brown in color. The belly is lighter in color. Some frogs have spots on their sides.
"This frog lives in bromeliad plants. Bromeliads are plants that can live on the ground or high up on other plants. Rainwater collects in the leaves of the bromeliads. The frogs lay their eggs in this water. The first tadpoles to hatch eat the other eggs. Scientists think the tadpoles may also eat each other. ""Osteopilus brunneus"" tadpoles do eat green bromeliad frog tadpoles if they are in the same plant. But ""Osteopilus brunneus"" lays its eggs in larger bromeliad plants, and the green bromeliad frog lays its eggs in smaller ones. Scientists think green bromeliad frogs do this so that the ""Osteopilus brunneus"" tadpoles will not eat their young."
The green bromeliad frog lives in tropical forests and subtropical forests.
The adult frog eats insects. It eats leafhoppers.
This frog is in some danger of dying out. This is because human beings cut down the forests where they live to build houses and to collect wood for building.

Exothermic reactions
An exothermic reaction is a reaction where the substances react chemically to release energy in the form of heat.
"An example of this is combustion (burning). Exothermic reactions transfer energy to the surroundings. The energy is usually transferred as heat energy, causing the reaction mixture and its surroundings to become hotter. The temperature increase can be detected using a thermometer. Some examples of exothermic reactions are:"
"The chemical reaction that does the complete opposite, and absorbs heat, is an endothermic reaction."

"On January 10, 1998, Muni opened the Muni Metro Extension to 4th and King/Caltrain. It was originally served by a temporary shuttle service, the E Embarcadero, which ran between Embarcadero station and 4th and King/Caltrain. On August 22, 1998, the E Embarcadero line was removed and the N Judah line was extended to its place."
"A lot of service changes took place at the time when the T Third Street line began service on April of 2007. The N Judah was cut back to Embarcadero station; the surface part on the Embarcadero was served only by the T Third Street line, plus the J Church line at peak hours. The changes were unpopular with the public; they caused big delays in the Market Street subway and made N Judah riders transfer to reach the Caltrain station when they did not before. On June 30, 2007, Muni reversed several of the changes; the J Church and N Judah were put back to their previous routes."
Future plans.
"Future plans, according to the SFMTA Rail Capacity Strategy, include a new subway tunnel which connects to the Market Street subway to 9th Avenue.

Though keeping their line designations, resulting in an upside-down, horseshoe-shaped route from Balboa Park to Bayshore and Sunnydale. At West Portal Station, inbound K trains heading towards downtown change their signs to the T line; at Embarcadero Station, T trains heading into downtown change signs to the K line."
"The underground section of the line was closed west of Castro station from June 25 to August 24, 2018, due to the Twin Peaks Tunnel shutdown. On August 25, 2018, at the end of the shutdown, Muni began running two-car trains on the K/T line."

Fight against the chase of witches.
Praetorius fought against torture and against the hunting of witches. Some women were accused of being witches. People thought that witches can do harm to others. So these women were arrested and put in prison.
In 1597 Anton Praetorius protested against the torture of women accused of witchcraft.
Praetorius was so shocked about the torture of the accused woman that he demanded a stop. His protest was successful.
"In 1598 he wrote a book to protest against torture and the prosecution of witches. The book was published again in 1602, 1613 and in 1629. Praetorius described the terrible situation of the prisoners and protested against torture."
Theological argument against witchcraft.
"Praetorius was a Protestant minister. He believed that man can do either good or bad things. However, God chooses certain people to do certain things. Those things can be good or bad. According to Praetorius, witchcraft can only be a fall from the favour of God, and a pact with the devil. But, neither the devil nor sorcerers can do more than is in their nature (and predestination). God will punish those who are witches or sorcerers. This however, does not give human courts a right to put those to death, they believe are guilty of the crime of witchcraft. For Praetorius, witchcraft cannot exist, because it is beyond the faculties of either man or the devil. It is also against Nature."

Frogs as pets
"Frogs have become a popular exotic pet. They can be kept in basic conditions, compared to reptiles. They are not expensive and their food is easily purchased. Common pet frogs includes ranids, hylids, bufonids, leptodactylids, and dendrobatids."
"Pet frogs can be fed a lot of different live foods. These include crickets, rodents and fish. Small pet frogs will only eat crickets, fruit flies, springtails and other small arthropods. Medium-sized pet frogs can be fed larger crickets, mealworms, butterworms, silkworms, grasshoppers and small fish. Large pet frogs like ""Ceratophrys"" can be fed small fish, other frogs, reptiles, and small mammals such as mice or rats."
"Amphibians of all sizes would need different terrariums. Tree frogs like to climb and can escape if a pet owner does not add a top cover for their tanks. Semi-aquatic amphibians need both land and water divided in the tank. Tropical frogs would need mist and high humidity in their terrariums. All water for amphibians must be dechlorinated. The chlorine can kill amphibians, and may be in tap water. Many amphibians are popular exotic pets and are found in some pet stores."

Ossicles
The ossicles are the three smallest bones in the human body. They may be called ear bones or auditory ossicles. They are in the auditory system of all mammals.
They are contained within the middle ear space and serve to transmit sounds from the air to the fluid-filled labyrinth (cochlea). The absence of the auditory ossicles would cause moderate-to-severe deafness.
Anatomy.
"The ossicles are, in order from the eardrum to the inner ear (from superficial to deep), the malleus, incus, and stapes. The terms mean hammer, anvil, and stirrup."
Development.
"Studies have shown that ear bones in mammal embryos are attached to the dentary, which is part of the lower jaw. These are ossified (turned into bone) portions of cartilage -- called Meckel's cartilage -- that are attached to the jaw. As the embryo develops, the cartilage hardens to form bone. Later in development, the bone structure breaks loose from the jaw and migrates to the inner ear area. The structure is known as the middle ear, and is made up of the incus, stapes, malleus, and tympanic membrane. These correspond to the quadrate, prearticular, articular, and angular structures in earlier land vertebrates."

Khrushchev's Secret Speech
Krushchev's Secret Speech was the speech in which Nikita Krushchev denounced Joseph Stalin after the latter's death. The speech was a spoken report to the Twentieth Party Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on 25 February 1956. Its title was On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences.
"The report was known as the ""Secret Speech"" because it was delivered at a closed session of Communist Party delegates, with guests and members of the press excluded. Although the text of the Khrushchev report leaked almost immediately, the official Russian text was published only in 1989 during the glasnost campaign of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev."
"The speech was based on an investigation of the repressions of the delegates of the 1934 XVII Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. They were victims of the Stalinist purges of the 1930s. Estimates of Stalin's role in history were quite changed by the speech. Many in the West who had been Communist Party member, or at least sympathetic fellow-travellers, resigned their memberships and no longer defended the reputation of Stalin. Russian writers like Solzhenitsyn found they were treated with more sympathy. The speech was a significant turning-point in history."
"The speech caused such shock to the audience that, according to some reports, some of those present suffered heart attacks, and others later committed suicide.

Tamamo-no-Mae
"Tamamo-no-Mae (玉藻前) is a legendary figure in Japanese mythology and folklore. In the Otogizoshi, a collection of Japanese prose written in the Muromachi period, Tamamo-no-Mae was a courtesan under the Japanese Emperor Konoe. She was said to be the most beautiful and intelligent woman in Japan. Tamamo-no-Mae's body mysteriously always smelled wonderful, and her clothes never became dirty. Tamamo-no-Mae was not only beautiful, but she was very wise in all subjects. Although she appeared to be only twenty years old, there was no question that she could not answer. She answered every question posed to her, whether about music, religion, or astronomy. Because of her beauty and intelligence, everyone in the Imperial Court adored her, and Emperor Konoe fell deeply in love with her."
"After some time had passed, the Emperor suddenly and mysteriously fell ill. He went to many priests and fortune-tellers for answers, but they had none to offer. Finally, an astrologer told the Emperor that Tamamo-no-Mae was the cause of his illness. The astrologer explained that the beautiful young woman was in fact an evil fox with nine tails (kitsune), who was making the Emperor ill in a evil plan to take the throne. Following this, Tamamo-no-Mae disappeared from the court."
"The Emperor ordered Kazusa-no-suke and Miura-no-suke, the most powerful warriors of the day, to hunt and kill the fox. After escaping from the hunters for some time, the fox appeared to Miura-no-suke in a dream. Once again in the form of the beautiful Tamamo-no-Mae, the fox told Miura-nosuke would kill it the next day, and begged for its life. Miura-no-suke refused."
"Early the next day, the hunters found the fox on the Plain of Nasu, and Miura-no-suke shot and killed the magical creature with an arrow. The body of the fox became the Sessho-seki, or Killing Stone, which kills anyone that comes in contact with it. Tamamo-no-Mae's spirit became Hoji and haunted the stone."
"Hoji is said to have haunted this stone until a Buddhist priest called Genno stopped for a rest near the stone and was threatened by Hoji. Genno did a certain spiritual ritual, and begged the spirit to consider her spiritual salvation, until finally Hoji surrendered and swore to never haunt the stone again."
"In Matsuo Bashō's famous book, ""The Narrow Road to the Deep North"" (Oku no Hosomichi), Bashō tells of visiting the stone."
"The stone split on March 5, 2022. While some have humorously said that Tamamo-no-Mae is now free, there is a far more general belief that the split is an omen of impending tragedy."

Sublimation is how a solid becomes a gas without becoming a liquid first. It happens when the particles of a solid absorb enough energy to completely overcome the force of attraction between them. Most substances can sublimate only at low pressure. Many can sublimate in space.
"Sometimes snow sublimates. This is usually on sunny winter days when the air is very dry. Snow may look like it disappears on a cold sunny day, but this is not sublimation because it forms a thin layer of liquid water first."
"At normal atmospheric pressure on the surface of the Earth, only some compounds like dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) can go through this process. CO2 changes from dry ice, a solid to a gas without being a liquid. Also diamond, graphite, iodine, ammonium chloride and aluminium chloride sublime rather than melt at atmospheric pressure."

Stolen base
"In baseball, a stolen base is when a baserunner advances to the next base while the pitcher is throwing the ball to home plate. In baseball statistics, stolen bases are displayed as SB. It is possible to steal second base, third base, or home plate, but not to steal first base."
"If the defense does not try to put the baserunner out (for example, if the catcher does not even look his way), the play is called defensive indifference (also called fielder's indifference). No stolen base is credited to the runner in this case. Defensive indifference is usually only scored instead of a stolen base when the game is in a late inning and the team with the stealing baserunner is down by more than one run. MLB Rule 10.07(g) defines defensive indifference."
Strategy.
"A player who is good at stealing bases needs not just running speed, but also good base-running instincts, quickness, and split-second timing. The scoring and guidelines for awarding a stolen base to a runner are covered by rule 10.07 of the Major League Baseball rule book."
"If a player is good at stealing bases, his manager may let him try to steal a base whenever he thinks he can. A player who is allowed to try to steal whenever he wants is said to have the ""green light"". Players who do not have the green light may only be allowed to steal when a coach or manager tells him to."

Taxicab number
"A taxicab number is the name given by mathematicians to a sequence of special numbers: 2, 1729 etc. A taxicab number is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two positive cubes in ""n"" distinct ways. It has nothing to do with taxis, but the name comes from a well-known conversation that took place between two famous mathematicians: Godfrey Hardy and Srinivasa Ramanujan."
The story about Godfrey Hardy’s taxi.
"Godfrey Hardy was a professor of mathematics at Cambridge University. One day he went to visit a friend, the brilliant young Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, who was ill. Both men were mathematicians and liked to think about numbers."
When Ramanujan heard that Hardy had come in a taxi he asked him what the number of the taxi was. Hardy said that it was just a boring number: 1729. Ramanujan replied that 1729 was not a boring number at all: it was a very interesting one. He explained that it was the smallest number that could be expressed by the sum of two cubes in two different ways.
This story is very famous among mathematicians. 1729 is sometimes called the “Hardy-Ramanujan number”.
Explanation of the Hardy-Ramanujan's number.
There are two ways to say that 1729 is the sum of two cubes.
1x1x1=1; 12x12x12=1728. So 1+1728=1729
But also: 9x9x9=729; 10x10x10=1000. So 729+1000=1729
"There are other numbers that can be shown to be the sum of two cubes in more than one way, but 1729 is the smallest of them."
Known taxicab numbers.
"Since the famous conversation between Hardy and Ramanujan, mathematicians have tried to find other interesting numbers that are the smallest number that can be expressed by the sum of two cubes in three/four/five etc. different ways. These numbers are very, very big, and have been found by computers."
"So far, the following six taxicab numbers are known :"
Bernard Frénicle de Bessy
"Bernard Frénicle de Bessy (about 1605–1675), was a French mathematician. He was born in Paris. He wrote many papers about mathematics, number theory and combinatorics.

He also discovered a taxicab number and in 1693, he described all 880 essentially different normal magic squares of order 4."
"Like Fermat, Frénicle was an amateur mathematician, but he wrote letters to famous people such as Descartes, Christiaan Huygens, Mersenne and also Fermat, who was his friend. He is mainly remembered for his discoveries about number theory."

Phenol
"Phenol is the organic compound with formula C6H5OH. It is a white solid. It has an OH group (hydroxyl group) bonded to a benzene ring. It is an alcohol. Because the aromatic group attracts electrons, it is quite acidic. topolin is produced from petroleum. It is an important molecule because it can be used to make many other products. It is also used in detergents and herbicides."
Properties.
Acidity.
"Phenol has a pKa of about 10. For normal alcohols this number is usually around 15. However, phenol is less acidic than compounds like carboxylic acids. The reason for this high acidity is the resonance stabilization of the molecule when it becomes an anion."
Reactions.
"Phenol can do electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions very well. This is because the lone pair on the oxygen atom can give electrons through the benzene ring to an electrophile. Because the lone pair is so high in energy however, sometimes phenol reacts too many times."
History.
"Phenol was first discovered in 1834. It was found as a product of burning coal. One of its first uses was to kill germs in surgery. It is still used today in some analgesics. During the Second World War, phenol was also used by the Nazis. They used it in concentration camps to quickly kill small groups of people."

They are intended to show San Diego's maritime history. The Pavilion was first built as an open-air facility under the roof. This made it hard to get people to use it. Because of this, the Pavilion area was enclosed in glass. This made it much more usable."
History.
San Diego approved the construction of a new convention center in 1983. It was built on land owned by the Port of San Diego. Construction of the building began in March 1987 and was finished in November 1989. The center was made larger in September 2001 by doubling its square footage.

There may have been other animals on the ""Mayflower"", but only these two dogs had been mentioned."
"As part of the creation of the Muni Metro system, streetcar operation switched to light rail operation in 1981 – the last line to do so. While many streetcar lines switched to bus lines after World War II, the J Church avoided this due to the private right-of-way it uses between 18th Street and 22nd Street."
Extension to Balboa Park.
"The outer end of the line was originally at Church and 30th Streets. It was where streetcars used a triangle of railroad track to turn back. Studies to further the line from its southern terminus had been made in the 1920s and 1970's. In 1990–91, the tracks were extended to the Balboa Park BART station and the Metro Center (Muni light-rail base), giving J-line cars a much shorter connection to the yard than before. The extension opened on August 31, 1991. But the new section was used only by light rail cars starting or ending their runs; all-day J-line service was not use the new tracks until June 19, 1993."

History.
Municipal Railway.
"The San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni) opened its K line along with the Twin Peaks Tunnel on February 3, 1918. The line ran from St. Francis Circle station along West Portal Avenue, through the tunnel, along Market Street to Van Ness Avenue (joining the J Church at Church Street). And along existing tracks on Van Ness Avenue to Pine Street. On June 1, 1918, the J and K lines were removed from Van Ness Avenue and went further along Market Street to a loop at the Ferry Building."
Changes in 1980s.
"More changes to the service route followed until finally on December 17, 1980. It was when the K line was light rail operated, with service from Embarcadero Station to Balboa Park, on weekdays only. Weekend service continued to use PCC cars until September 1982. This was when the Muni Metro became fully operational."
Changes in 2000s.
"From February 2001 to June 7, 2003, K Ingleside service was cut back to St. Francis Circle. It was also replaced by buses on Ocean Avenue for street repaving, and route reconstruction along Ocean Avenue."
"Following service changes on June 30, 2007, the K Ingleside and the T Third Street lines were combined inside the Market Street subway tunnel. Though keeping their line designations, resulting in an upside-down, horseshoe-shaped route from Balboa Park to Bayshore and Sunnydale. At West Portal Station, inbound K trains heading towards downtown change their signs to the T line; at Embarcadero Station, T trains heading into downtown change signs to the K line."

This phase is expected to last through 2024."
Emergency telephone
"An emergency telephone is a special telephone that can be used in an emergency situation. Such telephones can usually be found on highways, and other big roads. They can also be found in places where people feel unsafe, such as big parks or the campuses of universities. Emergency telephones are also placed at spots where many people commit suicide, like bridges or cliffs."
"Emergency phones are usually connected directly, there is no need to dial a telephone number. Lifting the receiver, or pushing a button will make the call. Very often emergency telephones will also tell the other side where they are. This is because people may not know where they are or they may be in shock because of an accident that just happened."
"There are many special rules that apply to emergency telephones. They need to be in special colors, because color-blind people may not be able to tell the difference between certain colors. They also need to be easy to use. In an emergency situation, many people do not have time to think about how to operate them."

"Duffield Castle, Derbyshire"
"Duffield Castle was a Norman Castle in Duffield, Derbyshire. The site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument."
"The rocky site was easy to defend, because it was surrounded by the river in three sides and hard to climb. It is not clear whether the site was inhabited in prehistoric times. The Roman army might have been there to protect the ford nearby where people from Lutudarum Wirksworth passed before joining Rykneld Street at Derventio (now part of Derby) which was N-shaped route for the North Sea ports."
"Ancient items of Anglo-Saxons have been found there. They suggest that Saxon Thane named Siward or his relatives might have occupied the site. Also, many Roman or Romano-British pottery has been found, including roof tiles of Roman pattern. Some of them were kept in the Derby Museum, but others kept in the Parish Room were unfortunately lost."
The Norman Castle.
"Henry de Ferrers (Ferrars) faithfully served King William and was given land in Derbyshire, which became known as Duffield Frith. It was between Heage and Shottle on the North, and Tutbury on the South. He built Tutbury Castle as his main residence. He built another castle at Duffield to protect north side of his land. This castle was probably built of wood."
"His third son, Robert, fought the Scots in the Battle of the Standard in 1138, and became the first Earl of Derby."
"His great grandson, William, became the Earl in 1162. He supported King's sons when they resisted Henry II, and finally both castles were destroyed in 1173."
"William II was favored by King John, and took back the land of Wirksworth, Ashbourne, and Horston Castle (Horsley). The castles at Tutbury and Duffield were rebuilt with stone. William III was also favored as William II was."
"The next Earl (the 7th generation), Robert, fought against Henry III and Tutbury Castle was destroyed. Once the king forgave Robert, but he resisted again and was defeated in battle at Chesterfield. He lost his land in 1269 and Duffield Castle was destroyed. His lands were given to Prince Edmund, who became first Earl of Lancaster shortly later."
"The castle was completely destroyed. Most of the stones were taken away as materials of other buildings, and the place gradually retuned to wild."
Excavations.
"When the site was surveyed, the base of a traditional Norman motte and bailey castle was found with a large rock on it. The size of the rock was really remarkable, about 98 feet in length and 95 feet in width, only slightly smaller than the White Tower in London."
"The grounds were saved with definite shape of foundations, and transferred to the National Trust in 1899. For many years, Parish Council was in charge of the site, but recently the role was handed down to the Trust."
"Other surveys in the 1930s and in 1957 verified the residence before the arrival of the Normans, because many Romano‑British items were found."
"A geophysical investigation of the site was carried out by the University of Bradford in 2001. Traces of other structures to the south and the southeast were found, and they appeared to date from the same period. The Trust is planning to raise necessary funds to carry out further investigations."

Yukultji Napangati
Yukultji Napangati is an Australian Aboriginal artist. She is a painter of the Papunya Tula group of artists. She is part of a generation of female painters who followed in the footsteps of the original male Papunya Tula artists.
"Yukultji grew up around Marruwa, a waterhole near Lake Mackay. She grew up without knowing about places like Kiwirrkurra, or her relatives living there. She had never met anyone from outside her own family. Her family lived a completely traditional nomadic way of life. Her father, Lanti (or ""Joshua""), had lived for a short time at the mission in Balgo, but he had run away after getting into trouble for stealing food. It was his decision to stay in the desert, and kept his family far away from the towns. Yukultji's father died sometime around 1980. The family finally came into contact with outsiders in October 1984, and were settled at Kiwirrkurra. The event was big news at the time, and the family became famously known as ""the last nomads"". Yukultji was the youngest of this group."
"Yukultji experienced major culture shock when first coming out of the desert. She often found new things difficult to understand. In an interview once, she remembers, ""I hopped into a car and crouched down, and I saw the trees move. I was frightened. I was scared. I jumped right off because the trees were racing around the place."""
"Yukultji began painting in the early 1990s. Before this, she had watched her brothers painting and later decided to try it for herself. She paints stories and songs from her and her mother's dreaming. These stories are about her traditional country, around Marruwa, Ngaminya and Marrapinti."
"Her paintings are shown in several public collections in Australia. Her work has been shown in over 80 exhibitions in Australia and overseas. She was a finalist in the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards, in 2006, 2009, 2010 and 2011. In 2012, Yukultji won the Alice Prize, an award for Australian artists in Alice Springs."
Yalti Napangati
"Yalti Napangati (born around 1970) is an Australian Aboriginal artist. She is a painter of the Western Desert style of art, and paints for the Papunya Tula school. Her husband, Warlimpirrnga, is also a well-known artist. They were both members of the infamous Pintupi Nine, the last group of Aborigines living a traditional way of life in Australia."
"Yalti was born in the Great Sandy Desert, sometime around 1970. She and her family lived as nomads in the desert, travelling along the western side of Lake Mackay. Most other Pintupi families had moved into settlements during the 1950s, but Yalti's father kept the family away from these. Her parents were Lanti (or ""Joshua"") and Nanu. She has an older brother, Tamayinya, and a younger sister, Yukultji. She married Warlimpirrnga sometime during the early 1980s, possibly when she was as young as 12. She and her family came out of the desert in 1984. She now lives at Kiwirrkurra, and has two sons and two daughters."
"Yalti finished her first paintings for Papunya Tula in June 1996. She makes acrylic paintings of landscapes associated with Pintupi dreaming stories. Her paintings are of important places in her country, around Marruwa, Laurryi, Wirrulnga and Patjarr."

"James Buchanan was born on April 23, 1791 in Cove Gap, Pennsylvania, into a prosperous merchant family. He had four sisters and three brothers, and studied at the Old Stone Academy before entering Dickinson College in 1807. There he studied law and was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar Association in 1812."
"Buchanan was engaged to Anne C. Coleman, but she died early, and he never had children. He is the only U.S. president who was never married."
"Buchanan served in both the House and Senate, representing Pennsylvania, as well as the Minister to Russia, under Andrew Jackson, before stepping taking the presidential career."
Presidency.
"During the beginning of his presidency, he called slavery an issue of little importance. This was clearly not the case at the time; Northerners and Southerners were very divided on slavery, almost to the point of war."
The Supreme Court declared that African Americans were not American citizens and that the states were allowed to keep slavery legal. James Buchanan supported that decision because he did not want the pro-slavery states to stop being part of the United States.
"Buchanan supported the rights of slave owners to keep their slaves and wanted Kansas to adopt a constitution that allowed slavery. Because of that, the Democratic Party was divided on that issue and after the 1858 Congressional election, there were more Republicans in Congress than Democrats. He did not get along with the Republicans."
He ordered troops to fight against Utah based on untrue information that Utah was planning a revolt. Buchanan later realized that he made a mistake and apologized.
"During his term, the country was becoming more and more divided over the slavery issue. A few months before his term ended, some of the southern states decided that they were going to not be a part of the United States any more."
"Buchanan believed that it was a bad thing, but he did nothing about it because he felt that using force against the south was against the Constitution. He did not even prepare the country for war."
Legacy.
"At the end of his term, he left the next president, Abraham Lincoln, to face the greatest crises in United States history, the Civil War."
"Some historians think that Buchanan was the worst president of the United States in the history, because he did nothing to prevent the Civil war."

Saudi Arabia is to the west and is connected to Bahrain by the King Fahd Causeway, and Qatar is to the south across the Persian Gulf. The Qatar-Bahrain Friendship Bridge, not yet built, will link Bahrain to Qatar as the longest fixed bridge in the world. Qatar and Bahrain's flag is the same design but not the same colors because Qatar is white and maroon and Bahrain is white and red."
History.
"People have lived in Bahrain before there was writing. It has been ruled and influenced by the Assyrians, Babylonians, Greeks, Persians, and the Arabs, who made the island Muslim. Bahrain was in old times known as Dilmun, Tylos, Awal and Mishmahig."
"The islands of Bahrain, set in the middle south of the Persian Gulf, have attracted many invaders in history. The word ""Bahrain"", ""Two Seas"", means that the islands contain two kinds of water, sweet water springs and salty water in the sea."
"A location between East and West, fertile lands, fresh water, and pearls made Bahrain important in history. About 2300 BC, Bahrain started trading with Mesopotamia (now Iraq) and the Indus Valley (now near India). It was then called Delmon, and was linked to the Sumerian Civilization about 2000 BC. Bahrain also became part of the Babylonian empire about 600 BC. Historical records called Bahrain the ""Life of Eternity"", ""Paradise"", the ""Pearl of the Persian Gulf"" and other names."
"Until 1521, Bahrain also ruled Al-Hasa and Qatif (both are now the eastern province of Saudi Arabia) and Awal (now the Bahrain Islands). The country had all of the land from what is now Kuwait to Oman. This was called ""Iqlim Al-Bahrain"" (Province of Bahrain). In 1521, the Portuguese took Awal (now Bahrain) from the rest and since then the name of Bahrain only means today's Bahrain."
Modern history.
"This view is disputed by some. ""Society for the Scientific Study of Religion"" stated in 1990 that there was not sufficient research for a consensus, and that ""one should not automatically equate the techniques involved in the process of physical coercion and control with those of nonphysical coercion and control""."
Management style of cults.
An oft-repeated criticism of cults is that their management style is dictatorial and exploitative. The following is one example:
Use of violence.
"Ownership of weapons and violence has occurred in some cults. The Branch Davidians under the direction of David Koresh used violence against Federal agencies, with tragic results for both sides. The later FBI report reveals the extent of their arms stockpile."
"The People's Temple included guards armed with submachine guns. These guards killed the visiting U.S. Congressman Ryan, and stood around the believers as they committed suicide. Members of the Manson Family were convicted of several murders."
The Cult
"The Cult are a English rock band. They formed in 1982 under the name Death Cult and later renamed to Southern Death Cult in 1983, then was again renamed to their current name The Cult."
1028
1028 (MXXVIII) was a common year when the Julian calendar was used. It was the twenty-eighth year of the 2nd millennium and the 11th century.
James A. Michener
"James Albert Michener ( or ; February 3, 1907 – October 16, 1997) was an American writer. His books include ""Tales of the South Pacific"", ""Hawaii"", ""The Drifters"", ""Texas"", and ""Poland"". Most of his 40 books are very large sagas. They are about the lives of many generations in a particular place. His non-fiction writings include the 1992 book ""The World is My Home"" and ""Sports in America""."
"Michener wrote that he did not know who his parents were or exactly when and where he was born. He was raised by an adoptive mother, Mabel Michener, in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. Some have argued that Mabel was his birth mother. He graduated from Swarthmore College, where he played basketball, in 1929. He later studied at the Colorado State Teachers College. He taught there for several years. He also taught at Harvard University."
"His writing career began during World War II. He was assigned to the South Pacific Ocean as a naval historian. He used his time there as the basis for ""Tales of the South Pacific"", his first book. This book was the basis for the musical ""South Pacific""."
"Michener met his wife Mari while in Japan. His novel ""Sayonara"" is autobiographical."
"On January 10, 1977, he was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Gerald R. Ford."
"In his final years, he lived in Austin, Texas, where he died of kidney failure on October 16, 1997 at the age of 90."
War of 1812
The War of 1812 was fought between the British Empire and the United States from 1812 to 1815 on land in North America and at sea. The British forces were helped by Canadian militia (volunteers) and Native Americans because British soldiers were busy fighting Napoleon I in Europe.
"In nearly every battle, the British defeated the attacking American forces. The war increased nationalism in both Canada and the United States."
Causes.
One reason given by Americans for declaring war was that the British were bothering American ships. The British claimed to be looking for British sailors who had deserted. Many British sailors deserted from the
"miserable conditions and the harsh discipline. Originally, many of the sailors had been pressed into service. It was the practice of the British to arrest any man they found on a street and to force him to serve on their ships. Many British sailors who escaped signed on as crew aboard American merchant ships. The British claim was somewhat true."
"In 1807, an American ship was boarded and then fired on, which created outrage among the American public. The British were also seizing American sailors at sea and forcing them to serve in the navy."
"The numbers of American seamen pressed into British service is not well known and may have been greatly exaggerated. The British were also sponsoring Native American territories in the Midwest to stop the United States from expanding westward. That made 10,000 Native Americans fight for the British."
"Napoleon I started the French invasion of Russia in 1812, just as the war started in North America. The Americans thought that the British would be busy fighting the French during the Napoleonic Wars to do much in North America."
The war.
"Fighting began when the United States started to attack the Canadian provinces in 1812. However, the British and the Canadians successfully defended their borders. In 1813, British and American ships fought in the Battle of Lake Erie. Americans under Oliver Hazard Perry won, which gave them control of Lake Erie. American forces raided and burned Toronto, which was then called York."
"New Mills most known employer is Swizzels Matlow, who make children's sweets. The company transferred to New Mills from London during the Blitz. Famous brands include ""Parma Violets"", ""Refresher"" chews, ""Drumstick"" lollies and - perhaps most famously - ""Love Hearts"""
Guido Westerwelle
Guido Westerwelle (27 December 1961 – 18 March 2016) was a German politician. He was Foreign Minister and Vice-Chancellor of Germany.
"Westerwelle was born in Bad Honnef, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany."
"He was an attorney before he became a politician. From 1994 to 2001 he was secretary general of the German liberal party, the Freie Demokratische Partei (FDP). In 2001 he became the leader of the party."
Westerwelle was also the leader of the FDP parliamentary group and from 1999 to 2005 head of the opposition in the German Bundestag.
"In June 2014, he announced that he had acute myeloid leukemia. He died of the disease on 18 March 2016 in Cologne, Germany at the age of 54."
He was openly gay and was in a civil partnership with sports manager Michael Mronz.
"Vancouver, Washington"
"Vancouver, Washington is a United States city, just north of the Columbia River in the state of Washington. It is directly north of Portland, Oregon and south of Vancouver, British Columbia. Both cities were named for George Vancouver, a British explorer and sea captain. The city of Vancouver includes Fort Vancouver, begun by the British Hudson's Bay Company in 1824. It was made part of the United States on June 15, 1846, as part of the Oregon Treaty. It is the fourth largest city in Washington State."
History.
"The Vancouver area was home to Native Americans before the arrival of Europeans. Chinook and Klickitat tribes called this area ""land of the mud turtles"" before 1775. Disease killed most natives before the Hudson's Bay Company came in the 1820s. The Hudson's Bay Company built Fort Vancouver to trade in beaver skins, which were used to make top hats. Workers at Fort Vancouver came from England, the Sandwich Islands, Scotland and Canada. Many trappers had native wives and lived outside Fort Vancouver."
"Americans began to arrive from the Oregon Trail. John McLoughlin was head man at Fort Vancouver and helped the Americans with tools and seed. Fort Vancouver closed in the 1840s. The city of Vancouver was incorporated in 1857 and was over three times as big by 1909. In 1917, the first bridge connecting Oregon to Washington over the Columbia River was built from Vancouver. In 1982 another bridge was built a few miles east for the I-205 freeway."
"Columbia Barracks became Vancouver Barracks and was the biggest US military base in Oregon, Washington or Idaho for many years. During World War I the Vancouver Barracks had a lumber mill to cut spruce wood to make biplanes. Another ship yard built ships for World War II. Shipyard workers came and Vancouver grew from 18,000 to over 80,000 people. Vancouver grew again and in 1997 grew again to almost its present size. About half as many people live just north of Vancouver as live inside the city. About one in three Vancouver workers have jobs in Portland, Oregon."
Geography and Climate.
"Vancouver is located at 45°38′1″ North, 122°36′11″ West (45.633743, −122.603011)."
"Vancouver is just north of the Columbia River and west of the volcanic Cascade Range mountains and the Columbia gorge. Vancouver is about fifty miles from the Pacific Ocean, which gives it rain. Because it is in a valley between the Pacific Coast and Cascade mountains, there are clouds in winter. When it is clear one can see Mount Hood, the Mount Saint Helens volcano and Mount Adams from Vancouver."
"Vancouver is north of Portland, Oregon and shares a similar climate: wet from November through June and dry from July through October. Vancouver has snow once or twice a year, on average. Vancouver has a total area of . Abuout 7% is water, including Vancouver Lake to the west."
Architecture and Buildings.
"The National Register of Historic Places says that Vancouver is a good place to visit. Because it is the oldest city in the area, Vancouver has a wide variety of buildings, including:"
"Fort Vancouver National Historic Site also has many structures, rebuilt as they were in the 1830s."
Radiant heating
"Radiant heating occurs when a hot surface warms other objects around it. Radiant heating has a long history of use in buildings by the Romans and the Koreans, and is much more efficient than standard ways of heating the air in a building. Underfloor radiant heating is the most common type of radiant heating used in buildings, but wall and overhead radiant heating systems are also used. Radiant heating can also be used to heat outdoor areas."
History of Radiant Heating.
"The Romans were the first people to use underfloor radiant heating systems. These systems were based on hypocausts, and used warm air for heat. The floor was set on top of many brick piles, leaving room for the hot air and steam produced by a furnace to pass underneath the floor. The hot air then went up chimneys on the sides of the walls, so the hot air and steam never actually went into the living rooms. These systems were very expensive to build and maintain, so only the rich could afford them."
"In Korea, radiant underfloor heating has been in use for about 2000 years. Ondol, which means ""warm stone,"" involves the use of stones and underground ducts to help transport warm air from the kitchen to the rooms in the house. Most homes and buildings in Korea still use ondol, although they now use hot water and electric systems. The American architect Frank Lloyd Wright discovered ondol in the early 1900s and used it in many of his building designs. Wright also invented hot water underfloor systems."
Types of Radiant Heating.
Underfloor heating.
"The most common kind of radiant heating is underfloor heating. There are three types of underfloor heating: hot air systems, hot water systems and electric systems."

During the dinner party they come close to boasting about their crime and arouse the suspicions of the teacher who eventually exposes them and alerts the police. The movie is famous for seemingly being made in one long shot without changing the camera angle. It is also known for implying a homosexual relationship between the two intellectuals at a time when homosexuality was rarely mentioned in movies or popular American culture."
Early modern period
"The early modern period of human history, is a time from 15001800 (roughly). This time follows the Middle Ages. It is the start of recognizable nations that we know today."
"In the history of Europe, the early modern period follows the Medieval period. It begins around the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, and includes the Renaissance period, and the Age of Discovery. It includes the discovery of America, and the discovery of the sea route to the East. It ends around the French Revolution in 1789."
Europe.
"In 1453 Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Empire. Science, transport, and communications improved. This is also called the Renaissance. For European countries with many ships, this was the Age of Discovery. Europe was beginning to expand to the New World."
"Trade with Asia was common, after Europeans found their way around Africa and into the Indian Ocean. Late in this period the European countries started setting up colonies there."
Asia.
"The Mughal Empire began in 1526. This Empire had a orderly government, widespread economic prosperity and religious tolerance. At this time Asia was flourishing in Math and Science. Also the Ottoman Empire was ruling the Middle East, along with the Persian Empire."
National Assembly
"In these places, it is also illegal to treat a person with a service animal differently than any other person. The person with a service animal cannot be charged extra money, refused service, or kept apart from other people. A service animal can be asked to leave one of these places only if it is out of control (for example, if it is aggressive or urinates inside). The animal has to be on a leash, or controlled by its owner's voice or signals, all the time."
"No one can ask for proof that the animal is a service animal. Owners do not have to carry any special papers or prove that their service animal can do a special task. If an owner and a service animal enter one of these places, workers are only allowed to ask two questions to make sure the animal is a service animal and not a pet:"
It is legal to train your own service animal in the United States.
"Service animals do not get these same protections in most religious organizations. Most religious organizations are exempt from the ADA's requirements, which means they do not have to obey the ADA."
Other laws.
"Other laws have less strict definitions of which animals count as service animals. For example, the Department of Transportation's Air Carrier Access Act allows ""dogs and other service animals"" to ride with passengers on commercial airlines."
The Fair Housing Act also requires housing providers to allow service animals (including comfort and emotional support animals). This law does not say that only certain animals are allowed.
Laws in other countries.
Mexico &amp; South America.
"In most places in South America and Mexico, the place's owner or manager gets to decide whether to let a service animal in. There are no laws that protect service animals or their owners. In areas with many tourists, service dogs are generally welcomed without problems."
"In Brazil, however, the President created a new law about service dogs in 2006. The law says that all service dogs in Brazil must be allowed to go anywhere that the public could go. The ""Brasília Metro"" (the Brazilian public transportation system) has developed a program which trains guide dogs to ride it."
Europe.
"Different European countries have different laws about service animals. Some countries have laws that govern the entire country, and sometimes different parts of the country govern themselves."
Australia.
"In Australia, the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992 legally protects all assistance dog handlers."
"However, with current laws, owners may not always be allowed to have their service animals with them in all situations. Each state and territory has its own laws, which mainly have to do with guide dogs. Queensland has introduced the Guide Hearing and Assistance Dog Act 2009, which protects all certified assistance dogs."
Canada.
"In Canada, any service animal is allowed anywhere that the general public is allowed, as long as the owner is in control of the animal. In Alberta, there is a fine of up to $3000 for someone who refuses to let a service dog into a place where everyone else could go."
South Korea.
"In South Korea, the law says service dogs must be let into any areas that are open to the public. People who break this law can be fined for up to 2 million ""won"" (about $1691 in United States dollars)."

"This album was dedicated to Ken Millar, who calls himself ""Ross Macdonald."" Millar is a writer who writes mystery novels, and Zevon really liked Millar's stories. He met Millar in an intervention put together by the journalist Paul Nelson. For awhile this intervention helped Zevon not drink too much alcohol."
"Cancer, death and ""The Wind""."
"Warren Zevon did not like to go to the doctor, and never went to one when he was an adult. Before playing at the Edmonton Folk Music Festival in 2002, he started feeling dizzy and started to have a chronic cough. When Zevon told his dentist his problems, his dentist recommended seeing a doctor. When he finally visited one, the doctor diagnosed him with mesothelmia."
"Warren Zevon did not want to get treated for his cancer if it might keep him from making music. So instead he started to make his final album, titled ""The Wind"". He had a lot of friends who helped him make the album. These friends included Bruce Springsteen, Don Henley, Jackson Browne, Timothy B. Schmit, Joe Walsh, David Lindley, Billy Bob Thornton, Emmylou Harris, Tom Petty, Dwight Yoakam, and others."

Shrew opossum
"The order Paucituberculata contains the six surviving species of shrew opossum. ""Caenolestes"" is the main genus, and the group as a whole may be called 'caenolestids'."
"They are small, shrew-like marsupials of the Andes mountains of South America."
"20 million years ago, there were at least seven genera in South America. Today, just three genera remain. They live in inaccessible forest and grassland regions of the high Andes."
"Insectivores were absent from South America until the Great American Interchange three million years ago, and are present now only in the northwestern part of the continent. Shrew opossums have lost ground to the these and other placental invaders that fill the same ecological niches. Nevertheless, the ranges of shrew opossums and insectivores overlap broadly."
"Shrew opossums are about the size of a small rat (9–14 cm long), with thin limbs, a long, pointed snout and a slender, hairy tail. They are largely carnivorous, being active hunters of insects, earthworms and small vertebrates. They have small eyes and poor sight, and hunt in the early evening and at night, using their hearing and long, sensitive whiskers to locate prey. They seem to spend much of their lives in underground burrows and on surface runways."
"Largely because of their rugged, inaccessible habitat, they are very poorly known. Recent studies suggest that they may be more common than had been thought."
Australidelphia
The Australidelphia is a superorder of Australasian marsupial mammals.
"It consists in five extant (living) orders, which contain most of the world's marsupials."

"Lepidodendron is an extinct genus of primitive (tree-like) plant. They were the first large land plants, and a major part of the coal forest tropical flora."
"They were huge, over , and the trunks were often over in diameter."
"Sometimes called 'giant club mosses', they are actually closer to the quillworts ""Isoetes"" than to clubmosses."
Ecology.
They thrived during the Pennsylvanian sub-period of the Carboniferous 315–300 million years years ago.
The conditions were tropical swamps and rain forests of a huge river system much larger that the Amazon basin.
"Oda's main event was triple jump, but he also competed in long jump and high jump."
"He participated in all three events in the 1924 Summer Olympics, the 1928 Summer Olympics and the 1932 Summer Olympics."
"In 1928 games in Amsterdam, he won the gold medal in the triple jump event."

Freddy West Tjakamarra
"Freddy West Tjakamarra (previously Tjukurti Tjakamarra; born around 1932 – died 1994) was an Australian Aboriginal artist. He was a leader of the Pintupi people during their return to traditional lands in the 1980s. He was one of the founders of the Kiwirrkurra settlement in 1983. As a painter, West was part of the Western Desert movement, and was one of the very first painters of the Papunya Tula school."
Early life.
"Freddy West was born in the Great Sandy Desert sometime in the early 1930s. He was born in the Pollock Hills, north of where Kiwirrkura is today, and lived a nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle for the first half of his life. He and his family were mostly based along the western shore of Lake Mackay. They often travelled with another group, led by a man named Waku Tjungurrayi. These families became some of the last nomadic groups left in the desert – most other families having been settled in government stations since the 1950s. In 1962, West decided that he would go and join his relatives, who were living at Papunya. This is traditionally Luritja land, but the Pintupi had become displaced here because of weapons tests being done at Woomera. He met some officers of the Territory's welfare department in the area of Dovers Hills, and arranged for them to take him and his family to Papunya in a year's time. In August 1963, West and his family began to walk to Papunya and met the welfare officers on the way. West had two wives: Parara and Payu, who were sisters of the Napaltjarri skin grouping."
"At Papunya, West started to paint with Geoffrey Bardon. He became one of the first members of the Papunya Tula school, and a shareholder in the company. In the late 1970s, West campaigned strongly within the Pintupi community for them to leave Papunya and return to their traditional country in the west. He moved back west with other Pintupi in 1981 and set up the community of Kintore. He was later an important person in the establishment of Kiwirrkurra, in 1983. He lived there for most of the rest of his life. He married a third wife in October 1984, Takariya Napaltjarri. She was the daughter of Waku Tjungurrayi, and had only come out of the desert a few days before they were married. They soon separated, and Takariya remarried. With his two other wives, West had 15 children. He died in 1994."
Painting.
"West did not paint much compared with many other early Papunya artists. His early works depicted abstract scenes of men's ceremonies, and were very decorated. His later works depicted stories from the Pintupi dreamtime (""Tingari""), using a motif of circles and lines. He has works in the Australian Museum in Sydney, the National Museum of Australia in Canberra, the Art Gallery of Western Australia in Perth, and the Art Gallery of South Australia in Adelaide."
Pinta Pinta Tjapanangka
"Pinta Pinta Tjapanangka (late 1920s – 1999) was an Australian Aboriginal artist. He was one of the very first members of the Papunya Tula art movement. He is a well-known painter of Western Desert art. He belonged to the Pintupi community, and painted stories from the Pintupi Dreaming (""Tingari""). He painted mythological events that happened around his homeland, including around Winparrku, Lake MacDonald and Lake Mackay."
"Pinta Pinta was from Western Australia. He was born at Yumari, a place in the Great Sandy Desert. He was probably born sometime in the late 1920s (around 1927 or 1928). Before contact with White society, he lived a nomadic way of life in the desert. In the 1950s, he walked with his family to stay at Haasts Bluff, a government rations outpost. This was his first contact with modern Australian civilisation. His was one of the last groups in the country to come out of the desert."
"Pinta Pinta began painting in the mid-1970s, at Papunya. He moved to Kintore after it was founded in 1981. In 1984, Pinta Pinta and his family set up an outstation at Winparrku (Mount Webb), between Kintore and Kiwirrkurra. The family moved here shortly after. In 1988, he had a small part in the move ""Evil Angels""."
"His paintings mostly stick to black, white and ochre in colour. The most obvious motif seen in them is the circles and lines, which depict dreaming tracks. Some of his works are in the Australian Museum, the National Gallery of Victoria and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory."
"He had two sons, Matthew (born early 1960s) and Nyilyari (born about 1965). Nyilyari also became a famous artist."

Münchausen syndrome
"Münchausen Syndrome (pronounced ""MUNCH-house-in"") is a mental illness in which a person repeatedly fakes disease, illness, or psychological trauma to get attention or sympathy from others. It is sometimes called hospital addiction syndrome, thick chart syndrome, or hospital hopper syndrome."
"A related mental illness is Münchausen Syndrome by proxy. People with this condition abuse another person, usually a child, in order to get sympathy or attention for themselves. For example, a parent might make their own child sick in order to get attention and sympathy from friends and medical professionals."
Symptoms.
"People with Münchausen Syndrome exaggerate or create symptoms of mental or physical illness. Some people with Münchausen make up detailed stories about medical problems they have had, or they may fake symptoms. However, others may harm themselves in many different ways in order to make it seem like they are sick. For example, they might take laxatives to make it seem like they have diarrhea, or take blood-thinning medications to cause bleeding. They might inject themselves with bacteria so that they get an infection. They might cut or burn themselves in order to create wounds. Sometimes, after getting medical treatment, people with Münchausen also do things to slow down or prevent their recovery - for example, by ripping out stitches."
"The goal of this behavior is to get treatment, attention, sympathy, and comfort from medical professionals. For a person with Münchausen, being a patient feels familiar and comfortable. This meets a deep psychological need that the person has."
Risk factors.
There are several risk factors for Münchausen (things which make it more likely for a person to develop the condition). Münchausen is more common in people who:
Types.
A few different types of Münchausen Syndrome have been identified. They include:
The Weeping Woman
"The Weeping Woman is an iconic painting. It was painted by Pablo Picasso. It is an oil painting done on canvas. Picasso painted this after his break-up with his mistress, Dora Maar. After the breakup he always said she was weeping there for creating the term of ""Weeping Woman"". Pablo Picasso used his skill for geometric shapes and design in the painting. You can see multiple dimensions in this picture. Made in 1937 it shows how old Pablo Picasso would be now, though also how experienced he was then, being born in 1881. The level of experience it would take to be capable of such a level of geometric art work is surprisingly high considering there have been so many artists over the eras who have mastered it."
Larry Zeidel
"Lazarus ""Larry, Rock"" Zeidel (June 1, 1928 – June 17, 2014) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player. He played 5 seasons in the NHL as well as 12 seasons in the AHL."
"Zeidel started his hockey career with the Barrie Flyers of the OHA for 28 games and then moved on to play with the Quebec Aces of the QSHL for 3 seasons. After that he played with the Saskatoon Quakers of the WCSHL and then the Detroit Red Wings of the NHL for 19 games before being sent to their AHL affiliate, Indianapolis Capitals for a season. He was called up to the Red Wings and played 9 games with them before he joined the Edmonton Flyers of the WHL and played 1 season with them. He played joined the Chicago Black Hawks of the NHL for 1 season and rejoined the Edmonton Flyers for 1 season. He would then play in the AHL with the Hershey Bears for 8 seasons and the Cleveland Barons for 1 season. He returned to the WHL to play with the Seattle Totems for 2 seasons and joined the Barons again for 2 seasons. He ended his playing career after playing with the Philadelphia Flyers for 2 seasons."
He won the Stanley Cup in 1952 during his time with the Detroit Red Wings.
Zeidel was Jewish and because of this antisemitic remarks were said to him during his playing career. His grandparents were killed in concentration camps by Nazis.
"Zeidel suffered from dementia during his last years. He died in Pennsylvania from heart failure and renal failure, aged 86."
"The Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) is an African-American civil rights group. The SCLC was very important in the Civil Rights Movement. Martin Luther King, Jr. was its first president."
"Today, the SCLC says it is ""a nonprofit, non-sectarian, inter-faith, advocacy organization that is committed to nonviolent action to achieve social, economic, and political justice."" This means the group is open to people of all faiths and religions, not just Christians."
Creation.
"The SCLC was created in 1957, after the Civil Rights Movement's successful Montgomery Bus Boycott. On January 10, 1957, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. invited about 60 black pastors and leaders to Atlanta, Georgia. Their goal, at the time, was to end segregation on buses in the Southern United States. However, they agreed that they would only use non-violent ways of protesting and trying to make change. Their motto was: ""Not one hair on one head of one white person shall be harmed."""
"About a month later, the group met again in New Orleans, Louisiana. They decided that their goal would be to end segregation everywhere not just on buses. They also chose Dr. King as their president, and chose the name ""Southern Christian Leadership Conference."""
"The SCLC also chose a group of leaders called the Board of Directors to be in charge of making final decisions and planning strategies. At first, some churches and civil rights organizations joined the SCLC. However, it was difficult to get churches to join. Groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the White Citizens' Council used violence and terrorism to attack civil rights activists. So did the police in many states. Some churches which joined the SCLC, or did civil rights work, were bombed or set on fire."
Activities.
Citizenship Schools.
"In 1954, civil rights activists started ""Citizenship Schools."" These schools taught African-American adults to read so they could get driver's licenses; fill out forms; open bank accounts; and pass literacy tests that only black people had to pass to sign up to vote. The program spread across the South. They called themselves the ""Highlander Folk School."""
"In 1961, the state of Tennessee took the Highlander Folk School's land and property away. In that year, the SCLC rescued the Citizenship School program. The Schools' teachers pretended to be teaching adults to read. Secretly, they were teaching about democracy, civil rights, leadership, getting people together to protest, politics, and protest strategies. All of these things would be very important in the Civil Rights Movement."
"Eventually, close to 69,000 teachers taught Citizenship Schools throughout the South. Most of these teachers were volunteers who were not paid. Many of the Civil Rights Movement's adult leaders went to or taught Citizenship Schools."
Work in the Civil Rights Movement.
The SCLC's work in the Civil Rights Movement included:
1968-1997.
"Ralph Abernathy became the President of the SCLC after Dr. King's murder. Under his leadership, the SCLC:"
"Abernathy was President until 1977. Joseph Lowery replaced him, and was President until 1997."
1997 today.
"Since 1997, some of the issues the SCLC has worked on include:"
Chivalric romance
"Chivalric romances are stories, poems or songs. They were written about marvel-filled adventures. Knights having heroic qualities went on quests. It is the emphasis on love and courtly manners which distinguishes it from other kinds of epic. Other types of epic are about masculine military heroism."
Romances were written in European languages of the Middle Ages.
"The best known romance was King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight"" is another example."
Comet Swift–Tuttle
Comet Swift–Tuttle (109P/Swift–Tuttle) is a periodic comet with an orbital period of 133 years. It fits the classical definition of a Halley-type comet with a period between 20 and 200 years. It was independently discovered by Lewis Swift and Horace Parnell Tuttle in July 1862. It has a well-known orbit and has a comet nucleus 26 km in diameter.
"Chinese records show that in 188 AD the comet reached apparent magnitude 0.1. In 1862, the comet was as bright as Polaris. The comet made a return appearance in 1992, and became visible with binoculars. In 2126 it will be a bright naked-eye comet reaching about apparent magnitude 0.7."
"It is the parent body of the Perseid meteor shower, perhaps the best known shower and among the most reliable in performance."
Near-Earth orbit.
"A close encounter with Earth is predicted for the comet's return to the inner Solar System in the year 4479, around Sept. 15; the closest approach is estimated to be 0.03–0.05 AU, with a probability of impact of 1, or 0.0001%."
"Comet Swift–Tuttle has been described as ""the single most dangerous object known to humanity"". However, the probability of Earth impact per orbit is about a million to one against. It is estimated as 2 (0.000002%). It is the largest Solar System object that makes repeated close approaches to Earth with a relative velocity of 60 km/s."
An unusual aspect of its orbit is that it is captured into a 1:11 orbital resonance with Jupiter; it completes one orbit for every 11 of Jupiter.
Legends.
The Moirang Shayon legends from the backbone of the Moirang Kangleirol.
"""Moirang Shayon"" (lit. ""Moirang incarnations"") is a genre of the seven incarnations of a God and a Goddess, induced under the direction of Lord Thangjing, in the ancient Moirang kingdom."
The list of the seven pairs of incarnations are:
Habutae
"Habutae is a type of silk. There are different kinds of ""habutae"" silk such as plain or striped ""habutae"". ""Habutae"" is traditionally used for kimono and undershirts. Recently, it is also used for general goods, works of art, and clothing. ""Habutae"" is smooth to touch, glossy, and soft. It has been said ""The quality of silk fabric begins with habutae and ends with it."" ""Fukui"" is a suitable region to produce ""habutae"" as the dryness and wetness of the air are well-balanced throughout the whole year."
History.
"In 1871, Kimimasa Yuri, who was a lord of ""Fukui"" Domain (region), brought some silk goods from Europe to Fukui when he joined a study tour in Europe. He showed the goods to people who studied silks in ""Fukui"" and they started doing technical research on weaving ""habutae"". In 1887, basic technology for weaving ""habutae"" silk was completed in ""Fukui"" city. The economic boom of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 and World War I boosted progress and production of ""habutae"" in ""Fukui"". In the early 1900s, production of ""habutae"" in Fukui earned 1.7 million dollars, up to 60% of the total exports of ""habutae"" in Japan. The demand for ""habutae"" made in ""Fukui"" has kept increasing in Japan, and it is still used in many kinds of daily goods such as clothing."
Weaving Process.
"Most of the process of making Fukui ""habutae"" silk is the same as the process of making ""habutae"" in other areas, but the weaving process of Fukui ""habutae"" silk is different from the weaving process of ""habutae"" in other areas. Also, the weaving process is the most important part of making Fukui ""habutae"" silk. Fukui ""habutae"" silk is made in a process called ""nureyoko(濡れ横)"". ""Nureyoko"" is a weaving method of weaving warps and wefts which is the two basic components of weaving thread into fabric after wetting wefts with water. Threads are made from raw silks that are imported from other countries such as China and Brazil. This process makes the cloth tight, elastic, and strong. It takes one day to weave 20 meters of ""habutae""."

National Diet Building
"The National Diet Building (国会議事堂, Kokkai-gijidō) is the building where both houses of the Japan's government, the Diet, meet. It is located at Nagatachō 1-chome 7–1, Chiyoda, Tokyo."
Sessions of the House of Representatives take place in the left wing and sessions of the House of Councillors in the right wing.
"The Diet Building was completed in 1936 and is made of only Japanese materials, except for the stained glass, door locks, and pneumatic tube system."
History.
"Plans for a Diet building began in 1881. The planners hoped to finish it by 1890, when the Diet would meet for the first time. They realized they could not build a very impressive building in time, so they decided to make temporary buildings at first. The first Diet building was a Western-style building made of wood. It burned down in 1891. Another wooden building was made and finished in 1891. It burned down in 1925. A third building was made. The Diet used it until 1936, when the current Diet building was finished."
Current Diet building.
"In 1910, the Finance Ministry started a planning group to take control over the new Diet Building design from the Home Ministry. Prime Minister Katsura Tarō chaired the commission, which recommended that the new building should be made in the Italian Renaissance architectural style. Many other people did not like this idea."
"The ministry had a public design competition in 1918. 118 architect teams sent designs. The first prize winner, Watanabe Fukuzo, produced a design similar to Ende and Böckmann's."
"The Diet Building was built between 1920 and 1936 with a floor plan based on Fukuzo's entry. The roof and tower of the building might have been inspired by another entrant, third prize winner Takeuchi Shinshichi, and are believed to have been chosen because they mixed European and East Asian architecture. The actual source for the ""Pyramid"" roof remains unclear, but Japanese historian Jonathan Reynolds suggests it might have come from from Shinshichi. Historian of Africa studies Zoe Strother says Shinshichi's design resembles the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, which was a model for some prominent Western designs in the early 1900s, such as John Russell Pope's 1911 award-winning House of the Temple in Washington, D.C. and the downtown Los Angeles City Hall, completed in 1928."

Panthoibi Khongul
"Panthoibi Khongul ()(literally, ""in quest of Panthoibi"" or ""Panthoibi's footprint""), also spelt as Panthoipi Khongkul, is an ancient Meitei literary work (puya), narrating about the quest of goddess Panthoibi. The text highlights the love saga of Panthoibi and her ultimate lover Nongpok Ningthou, after leaving her husband's house. Many scholars believe the work to be written during the 12th century AD."
The text also talks about how the festival Lai Haraoba was begun after the union of the two lovers.
Khongjomnubi Nongarol
"Linacre College is one of the colleges of the University of Oxford. It was founded in 1962, and was the third graduate-only college at the University. It was the first graduate college founded at Oxford to admit both male and female students."
Botanical name
"A botanical name is a formal scientific name which follows the ""International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants"" (ICN). If it concerns a plant cultigen, the additional cultivar term must follow the ""International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants""."
"The code of nomenclature covers ""all organisms traditionally treated as plants, whether fossil or non-fossil, e.g. blue-green algae (Cyanobacteria); fungi, including chytrids, oomycetes, and slime moulds; photosynthetic protists and taxonomically related non-photosynthetic groups""."
"The purpose of a formal name is to have a single name which is accepted and used worldwide for a particular plant or plant group. For example, the botanical name ""Bellis perennis"" was given to a plant species which is native to most of the countries of Europe and the Middle East, where it has various names in many languages. Later it has been introduced worldwide, bringing it into contact with more languages."
"Some English names for this plant species are: daisy, English daisy, lawndaisy. In other languages, some examples are: , , , ."
"The cultivar ""Bellis perennis"" 'Aucubifolia' is a golden-variegated horticultural selection of this species."
Parts in a name.
"Depending on rank, botanical names may be in one part (genus and above), two parts (species and above, but below the rank of genus) or three parts (below the rank of species):"
"A name in three parts, i.e., an infraspecific name (a name for a taxon below the rank of species), needs a ""connecting term"" to indicate rank. In the ""Calystegia"" example above, this is ""subsp."" (for subspecies). In botany there are many ranks below that of species (in zoology there is only one such rank, subspecies, so that this ""connecting term"" is unnecessary there). A name of a ""subdivision of a genus"" also needs a connecting term (in the ""Acacia"" example above, this is ""subg."", subgenus). The connecting term is not part of the name itself."
Binary name.
"For botanical nomenclature, the ""ICBN"" prescribes a two-part name or binary name for any taxon below the rank of genus down to, and including the rank of species. Taxa below the rank of species get a three part name."
A binary name consists of the name of a genus and an epithet.
Jean Kent
"Jean Kent (Joan Mildred Summerfield; 29 June 1921 – 30 November 2013) was a British movie and television actress. She was also known as Jean Carr. She was born in Brixton, London. Kent was known for her role as Mille Harris in ""The Browning Version""."
"Kent died in Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk on 30 November 2013, aged 92. She died following a fall a few days earlier at her home in Westhorpe, Suffolk."
House of Orléans
"The House of Orléans was a French noble and royal family. It descends from Louis XIV of France and his only brother Philippe, Duke of Orléans. The families main traditional home was the Palais Royal in Paris. The family later became very powerful during the reign of Louis Philippe I. He ruled France under the title ""King of the French"". The king successfully married his children into other royal families of Europe."
"The present head of the house is Prince Henri of Orléans. He is known as the Count of Paris. He also claims the title King of the French, but is known simply as ""His Royal Highness The Count of Paris"" and sometimes the ""Duke of France"". However, the titles are not officially recognised because France is no longer a monarchy. Henri has been a claimant to the throne since 1999. The Count was married to Duchess Marie Thérèse of Württemberg. She is herself a daughter of a one-time claimant to the throne of Württemberg."
Vicente Aleixandre
"Vicente Pío Marcelino Cirilo Aleixandre y Merlo (April 26, 1898 – December 14, 1984) was a Spanish poet. He was born in Seville. Aleixandre won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1977. He was part of the Generation of '27. He died in Madrid from tuberculosis in 1984."
Airline alliance
"An airline alliance is when two or more airlines make an agreement to work with each other. The three largest airline alliances are Star Alliance, SkyTeam, and Oneworld. Airline alliances make it easier for passengers to travel around the world, reducing their stops or connections. The biggest alliance is Star Alliance, which has 28 member airlines such as United, Lufthansa, and Air Canada. The second biggest is SkyTeam, which has 19 members including Delta, KLM, and Air France. The third biggest alliance is Oneworld, which has 13 members including American Airlines, British Airways, and Qantas."

Pokémon Black and White
"Pokémon Black Version and White Version are two role-playing games (RPGs) in the ""Pokémon"" series made by Game Freak for the Nintendo DS. The games were released in Japan on September 18, 2010, in Europe on March 4, 2011, in North America on March 6, 2011, and in Australia on March 10, 2011. The games have 156 new Pokémon, which brings the total to 649. These games introduce the largest amount of Pokémon in any generation."
Gameplay.
"""Pokémon Black"" and ""White"" are role-playing games where the player captures creatures called Pokémon. They can use them to battle against other Pokémon. One of the new features in the games are triple battles, which allows players to battle three Pokémon against three Pokémon. Alongside triple battles are Rotation Battles. Players still send out three Pokémon, but only one can battle at a time. The player can switch the position of their Pokémon during their turn. Also new is that the seasons change, and areas in the game have falling leaves in the fall, and snow in the winter."
Plot.
"""Pokémon Black"" and ""White"" take place in the Unova region, which is based on New York City and its surrounding area, unlike past games being based on regions of Japan. The plot of the game follows a new Pokémon trainer who is on a journey to become a Pokémon master. They do this by battling other trainers such as Gym Leaders, and finally the Elite Four. During this journey, the player meets an evil team known as Team Plasma, who look like knights. Team Plasma wants to make a new world where Pokémon are away from humans. After taking them down, the player must track down the first members, the Seven Sages, and battle them."
Adolf Anderssen
"Karl Ernst Adolf Anderssen (Breslau, 6 July 1818 – Breslau, 13 March 1879) was a German chess master, and a teacher of mathematics. He was recognised as the best player in the world for much of the time between 1851 and 1870."
"Anderssen won three great international tournaments: the first in London 1851, then London 1862 and Baden-Baden 1870. Anderssen lost matches in 1858 to Paul Morphy and, narrowly, to Steinitz in 1866. He was also a chess problem composer.p16"
"Anderssen became the most successful tournament player in Europe, winning over half the events he entered—including the Baden-Baden 1870 tournament, which is comparable to modern strong GM tournaments. His last success was at Leipzig in 1877 where he came second equal with Zukertort, behind Paulsen. He was then nearly 60."
"He is still famous for his brilliant sacrificial attacking play, particularly in the 'Immortal Game' (1851) and the 'Evergreen Game' (1852). He was also one of the most likeable of chess masters and became an elder statesman of the game, to whom others turned for advice or arbitration."
His status.
"Anderssen was never world champion because ""there was as yet no concept of a formal championship, or of the means by which one might be awarded... The world championship proper was the creation of Wilhelm Steinitz (18361900)... The first match for the world championship was in 1886""... Also: ""Wilhelm Steinitz... was the first person to use the title of Champion of the world...""."
Mathematician.
"Anderssen was a teacher of mathematics in Breslau (now Wroclaw). He became a professor in about 1862, and in January 1865 was awarded honorary degrees of PhD and MA. These honours were not for chess, but not much is known about the teaching part of his career."
Bayesian network
"A Bayesian network is a kind of graph which is used to model events that cannot be observed. This can then be used for inference. The graph that is used is directed, and does not contain any cycles. The nodes of the graph represent random variables. If two nodes are connected by an edge, it has an associated probability that it will transmit from one node to the other."
"Bayesian networks are mainly used in the field of (unassisted) machine learning. They have been used where information needs to be classified. Examples are image, document, or speech recognition, and information retrieval."
It is based on Reverend Thomas Bayes' discovery in the 1740s called Bayes' theorem.
History.
"The term ""Bayesian networks"" was made by Judea Pearl in 1985 to emphasize three aspects:"
"In the late 1980s, the seminal texts ""Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems"" and ""Probabilistic Reasoning in Expert Systems"" summarized the properties of Bayesian networks and helped to establish Bayesian networks as a field of study."
"Informal variants of such networks were first used by legal scholar John Henry Wigmore, in the form of Wigmore charts, to analyse trial evidence in 1913. Another variant, called path diagrams, was developed by the geneticist Sewall Wright and used in social and behavioral sciences (mostly with linear parametric models)."
"Xiphactinus (from Latin and Greek for ""sword-ray"") was a large, 4.5 to 5 m (15 to 20 feet) long predatory bony fish that lived in the Western Interior Sea, over what is now the middle of North America, during the Late Cretaceous. Skeletal remains of Xiphactinus have come from Kansas, Alabama, and Georgia in the United States, as well as Europe and Australia."
Description.
"Above all else, ""Xiphactinus"" was a great swimmer, able to speed towards or away from virtually anything else in the seas of the time. It may have been able to leap above the waves at times to help dislodge parasites from its skin. It was not however immune from attack. If injured, its large size meant it was easy to spot and could become prey for sharks, Mosasaurs, and other Xiphactinus."
Emperor Kenzō
"was the 23rd emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Kenzō to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Kenzō""-tennō"" was created for him posthumously by later generations."
"No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as ""traditional"" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty."
Traditional history.
Kenzō was a grandson of Emperor Richū; and he was adopted as heir by the childless Emperor Seinei.
Events of Kenzō's life.
"Very little is known about the events of Kenzō's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei."
After his death.
This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Kenzō.
"According to the Imperial Household Agency, Kenzō final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (""kofun""). This emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (""misasagi"") which is associated with the burial mound."
Kofun
are earthen tombs or tumuli in Japan. They were constructed between the early 3rd century and early 7th century.
These burial mounds are referenced in the name of the Kofun period (middle 3rd century - early-middle 6th century).
Many of the kofun have a keyhole-shaped mound () which is unique to ancient Japan.
Chess and computers
"Chess and computers have been connected since the earliest days of the computer. In the 19th century Charles Babbage had thought of the idea,p87 and in modern times Alan Turing, the mathematician and Bletchley Park codebreaker, put some thought into the idea. He was not a very good chess player, but was one of the creators of the first British computer. He is also credited with the creation of Computer science."
"There are two types of chess programs. One plays against a human opponent; the other helps the user become a better player. The two types can be made to work together, though they have different functions and work in different ways."
Chess engines.
"Chess engines are computer systems that can play chess games against human opponents. Many have been created; they can play at master level, though their processes are quite different from those of a human being.&lt;ref name=""H/W""&gt;Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. ""The Oxford companion to chess"". 2nd ed, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;p87 The best engines on the fastest computers have won matches against both Kasparov and Kramnik, but the software can be used at an easier level for a learner."
"Competitions are run by putting engines against each other, and the results are published. There is a World Computer Chess Championship, in which the details of the rules may determine which software wins. Software may also be rated on other scales, such as ease of usage."
Fritz.
"Fritz is a German chess program by Frans Morsch and Mathias Feist, published by ChessBase. It is the current market leader. There is also a different kind of Fritz called ""Deep Fritz"" that is made for multi-processing. The latest kinds of the consumer products are Deep Fritz 12 and Fritz 12. They came with reviews by Josh Waitzkin, who said that ""Fritz is like a woman that you can't get with. It just drives (makes) you to think in ways you've never thought before""."
Shredder.
"Shredder is a leading engine. It is also owned by ChessBase. It comes in various forms: Shredder 12, Deep Shredder 12; Shredder Classic. It has a reputation of being hard."

"The high-altitude ""Polylepis"" forests and woodlands are found in the Andes of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Chile. These trees are called Queñua, Yagual and other names. They grow at altitudes of above sea level. It is still unclear if the patchy distribution of these forests and woodlands is natural, or the result of clearing which began during the Incan time. Regardless, in modern times the clearance has had a faster pace, and the trees are now endangered. Some think as little as 10% of the original woodland is still here."
Wildlife.
"The Andes has a lot of wildlife. With almost 1,000 species, of which about 2/3 are endemic to the region, the Andes is the most important region in the world for amphibians."

"The Vicuña and Guanaco can be found living in the Altiplano, while the closely related domesticated Llama and Alpaca are commonly kept by locals as pack animals and for their meat and wool. The nocturnal chinchillas, two threatened members of the rodent order, live in the Andes' alpine regions. The Andean Condor, the largest bird of its kind in the Western Hemisphere, lives throughout much of the Andes but mostly in very low numbers. Other animals found in the mostly open habitats of the high Andes are the huemul, cougar, and foxes in the genus ""Pseudalopex"". And for birds, some species of tinamous (they are members of the genus ""Nothoprocta""), are the Andean Goose, Giant Coot, flamingos (mainly associated with hypersaline lakes), Lesser Rhea, Andean Flicker, Diademed Sandpiper-plover, miners, sierra-finches and diuca-finches."

Bihu
"Bihu is the most prominent festival celebrated by the people of Assam. It is a set of three celebrations performed throughout the year. The three Bihus are celebrated at different times of year, in the months of Bohaag (Baisakhi), Kaati (Kartik) and Maagh, according to Hindu calendar. As per modern calendar these days fall in the month of mid April, October/ November and early January."
"Assam is a small state in the north-eastern part of the country. Its economy is mainly based on agriculture. The inhabitants of Assam are known agrarians from ages. Hence all their daily activities and celebrations are agriculture oriented only. Bihu is also one of such festivals. It is very much evident from the months of celebration of this festival that these months are actually significant in relation with farming of native crop of Assam, the paddy. Bohaag bihu is celebrated at the seeding time of paddy. Kaati bihu is celebrated when the sowing of paddy is complete and the transformation of the saplings is done. Maagh bihu represents the culmination of the harvesting period of the crop."
"The word bihu is derived from the language of ‘dimasa kacharis’, which is the agricultural community of Assam, since ages. The word was originally ‘Bishu’, which meant ‘to ask for prosperity’ from the tribal god. Bihu is the distorted version of Bishu."
"Bohaag bihu is also known as Rongali bihu and celebrated with the highest joy and mirth among all the three bihus. As stated it is the commencement time of the new season of farming. But along with, Bohaag is the first month according to Assamese calendar. Hence it is also celebrated as the New Year festival. This period also marks the transition in the seasonal cycle and people greet the coming season of spring with enthusiasm. Rongali bihu is celebrated over a period of 7 days. There are various phases and significance of the respective 7 days of the bihu. The first day is known as goru bihu (cows are washed and worshipped). This is followed by manuha bihu (human beings take early day bath and wear new attire). Then on third day deities are worshipped and washed. Hence the festival stretches over a span of time and the celebrations culminate by bidding adieu to bihu on the last day of festival."
"Kati bihu is also known as kongali bihu. It is celebrated with solidarity. However, the celebrations are quietest of all the three bihus. The farmers are busy in their paddy fields and earthen lamps are lit to mark the celebrations. Farmers pray for a better crop during this time of the farming cycle."
"Maagh bihu is also known as Bhogaali bihu. Bhogalli means eating and enjoyment. Hence the name itself implies the mood of the festival. Men folk prepare cottages in the barren fields after harvesting of the crops and spend whole night while singing and dancing in communion. Delicious food and sweets are exchanged among the people. In the very next morning, the cottage is lit up in fire and this brings an end to yearly festival of bihu."
"It is quite evident that bihu is a festival of farming community whose livelihood is mainly dependent upon the agriculture. The festival of bihu is celebrated by one and all in Assam. The boundaries of rich or poor, cast creed etc are diminished in the dazzling light of joy and merriment."

Career.
"In ""Liber Pontificalis"", it says that they ascribe a decree to Pope Eleutherius that no kind of food should be despised by Christians(Et hoc iterum firmavit ut nulla esca a Christianis repudiaretur, maxime fidelibus, quod Deus creavit, quæ tamen rationalis et humana est)."
Underground cable
"An underground cable is a cable that is buried below the ground. They distribute electrical power or telecommunications. Such cables are an alternative to overhead cables, which are several meters above the ground. Overhead cables are often replaced with underground cables. Downtown areas with many tall buildings usually have few or no cables above ground, This is mainly for aesthetic purposes because underground cables can not be seen. They are also less dangerous to people because they are out of the way. They cost more to install, but last longer."

"Under Section 2, whenever there is a vacancy in the office of Vice President, the President nominates someone to replace the Vice President. If a majority of both Houses of Congress agree, that person becomes the Vice President."
Section 3: Presidential declaration.
"Section 3 says that a President can declare themselves ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of their office"" (unable to do their job). He or she must say this in a written letter to both the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Once the President does this, the Vice President becomes Acting President. The President can take back the Presidency at any time by sending letters to the President pro tempore and the Speaker of the House, saying he or she is able to discharge the powers and duties of the Presidency again."
Section 4 is the only part of the Amendment that has never been used. It allows other executive officials to declare the President unable to do his job. The Vice President must agree to do this. So must:
"To declare the President unable to do his job, these people would have to sign and give a letter to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House. As with Section 3, the Vice President would then become the Acting President."
"The President may take back the Presidency by sending a letter to the President pro tempore and the Speaker of the House. However, if the Vice President and the Cabinet think the President is still disabled and still cannot do his job, they can challenge his return. They have four days to write another declaration saying the President is still unable to do his job. The Vice President is still Acting President during these four days. Congress then has to get together within 48 hours, if they are not already in session. Then Congress has 21 days to make a decision. In the meantime, the Vice President is still Acting President."
"If two-thirds of each House of Congress votes that the President still cannot do his job, the Vice President would continue to be Acting President. If Congress does not vote this way, or if they do not vote at all within 21 days, the President takes over the Presidency again."
Uses.
"The Twenty-fifth Amendment has been invoked (used) six times since it was added to the Constitution. Section 1 has been used once; Section 2 has been used twice; and Section 3 has been used three times. Only Section 4 has never been used, though it was considered twice."
Use of Section 1.
"President Richard Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, before the House could vote on whether to impeach him for crimes related to the Watergate scandal. Vice President Gerald Ford became President as soon as Nixon resigned."
Use of Section 2.
"On October 10, 1973, Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned. Two days later, President Richard Nixon nominated United States Representative Gerald Ford of Michigan to be the new Vice President. According to Section 2, more than 50% of each House of Congress had to approve Ford as Vice President. By December 6, 97% of the Senate and 92% of the House had approved Ford. Ford was sworn in to the Vice Presidency later on December 6 before both Houses of Congress. Ford is the only person in United States history ever to be Vice President, and later President, without being elected to either office."
"When Gerald Ford became President after Richard Nixon resigned, the Vice Presidency became vacant. On August 20, 1974, the new President Ford nominated former New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller to be the new Vice President. On December 10, 1974, the Senate confirmed Rockefeller with a vote of 90–7. Nine days later, the House voted 287-128 to confirm Rockefeller. He was sworn into office later on December 19, 1974, before the Senate."
Use of Section 3.
"Presidents have used Section 3 of the 25th Amendment three times. Each time, they have given power to their Vice Presidents for a short time because they needed to get anesthesia for medical tests or surgery. The three Acting Presidents in United States history are listed below."
George H. W. Bush (1985).
"On July 12, 1985, President Ronald Reagan found out that he had a small growth in his colon that could turn into colon cancer. His doctor told him he needed surgery. Reagan decided to have surgery right away."
"However, Reagan did not want to invoke Section 3 of the 25th Amendment. He was worried that giving Presidential power away would set a bad precedent. The White House's head lawyer and Reagan's Chief of Staff suggested that he use Section 3 and give power to Vice President George H.W. Bush."
"Two letters were created. The first invoked Section 3 and said Reagan would be unable to discharge his duties. The second said that Reagan knew about Section 3, and did not think it applied to his situation, but still wanted Bush to take over during his surgery. On July 13, Reagan signed the second letter and had it delivered to the President pro tempore and the Speaker of the House."
"Reagan's autobiography, and other books, argue that Reagan clearly meant to give power to Vice President Bush.pp. 197–200 The White House lawyer, Fred Fielding, said:"
"However, since Reagan did not specifically mention Section 3 and say he could not do his job as President, he did not officially invoke the 25th Amendment."
Dick Cheney (2002; 2007).
"On June 29, 2002, President George W. Bush became the first President to officially invoke Section 3. He needed a colonoscopy, a test of the colon, and would be getting anesthesia. He formally gave power to his Vice President, Dick Cheney, using the rules that the 25th Amendment set out. Unlike Reagan, he specifically said he was using Section 3 of the 25th Amendment in his letter to the President pro tempore and the Speaker of the House. After about two hours, Bush was awake and took back the Presidency."
"On July 21, 2007, President Bush again invoked Section 3 so he could have another colonoscopy. Again, Cheney was Acting President for about two hours, until Bush was ready to take back the Presidency."
Considered use of Section 4.
"As of 2021, Section 4 has never been invoked, however there were at least two occasions where the use of Section 4 was considered and another where its non-use came under substantial criticism. These occurred during the presidency of Ronald Reagan."
1981: Reagan assassination attempt.
"On March 30, 1981, a man named John Hinckley tried to kill President Ronald Reagan. Reagan was shot and needed immediate surgery, so he could not invoke Section 3 to give power to his Vice President. His Vice President, George H.W. Bush, did not invoke Section 4, because he was on an airplane returning from Texas. Reagan was out of surgery by the time Bush got to Washington, D.C.pp. 195–6, 253-5"
"In 1995, Birch Bayh, who had written the Senate version of the 25th Amendment, wrote that Section 4 should have been invoked."
1987: Reagan accused of not doing his job.
"In 1987, Reagan's Chief of Staff, Donald Regan, resigned.p. 218 Howard Baker replaced him.p. 83 Reagan's staff told Baker that Reagan seemed lazy and unable to do his job. They told him to be ready for Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to be invoked."
"John ""Johnny Appleseed"" Chapman (September 26, 1774 - March 11, 1847) is an American folk hero. He was a Christian missionary and pioneer. His nickname came from the fact that he planted apple trees throughout the American Midwest. Many people consider him an early conservationist or ""tree-hugger"". He wandered the country, usually barefoot, and with a cooking pot on his head for most of his adult life, planting apple trees, teaching the Bible, telling stories, and befriending Native Americans, wild animals, and other settlers. Many stories have been told about him and his journeys, as well as art, books, and later movies, which makes him a folk hero. He was born in Leominster, Massachusetts and is buried in Johnny Appleseed Park in Fort Wayne, Indiana."
Facts.
"John Chapman is said to have been in the Wilkes-Barre region some time in the 1790s, practicing his profession as a nurseryman, but just when he embraced the Swedenborgian faith and began his missionary activities we cannot be sure, though it is probable that it was before he ever reached western Pennsylvania. There are some early accounts of John speaking of his own activities as ""a Bible missionary"" on the Potomac when he was a young man, and Johnny was seen for two or three consecutive years along the banks of the Potomac in eastern Virginia, picking the seeds from the pomace of the cider mills in the late 1790s.The apple seeds that Johnny obtained were free, as the cider mills wanted there to be more apple trees planted to improve their business."
"At the time of his death, Johnny Appleseed left an estate of more than 1,200 acres of nurseries, and he left these to his sister. He additionally had four plots located in Allen County, Indiana, which was a nursery that included 15,000 trees."
"Records show that John Chapman appeared on Licking Creek, in what is now Licking County, Ohio, in 1800, when he was twenty-six years old. He had probably come up the Muskingum River to plant near the Refugee Tract, which would soon fill up with settlers, when Congress actually got around to granting the lands. In April, 1798, the Continental Congress had ratified resolutions to donate public lands for the benefit of those who had left Canada and Nova Scotia to fight against the British in the Revolutionary War. The lands were actually set apart in 1801 and patents issued in 1802. Grants of land ranging from 160 acres to 2,240 acres were awarded according to the exertions of the patentee in the War. Johnny, with true Yankee enterprise, went ahead and planted his nurseries before the refugees arrived. Licking County, then a part of Fairfield, contained only three white families. By the time families were ready to settle the area, Johnny's tracts of land were ready for market."
Compact disc
"A Compact Disc, also called a CD is a storage device that are small plastic discs which store and retrieve computer data or music using light. Compact Discs replaced floppy disks because they were faster and could hold more information. The CDs made floppy disks become obsolete. CDs were invented by both Philips and Sony at the same time, but not together. Sony and Philips did work together to create a standard format and the technology to read CDs in 1982. CDs can hold up to 700 MB worth of data, which is about 80 minutes of music. Mini CDs were also made for special small programs like drivers. CDs that have computer information on them are called CD-ROMs, or Compact Disc - Read Only Memory. The diameter of a normal CD is 120 mm. The middle hole in a CD is about 1.5 cm)."
Maidstone
"Maidstone is a town in Kent, in England. It stands on the River Medway. Maidstone is the county town of Kent, meaning the local government is based there. Its name means ""stone of the maidens"". The town of Maidstone is within the borough of Maidstone, which also includes several surrounding villages. In 2001, 75,070 people lived in the town of Maidstone, and there were 138,959 in the whole of the Borough."
History.
"During the Civil War a battle took place in 1648, which was won by Oliver Cromwell's soldiers. A year later, Andrew Broughton, who was then Mayor of Maidstone (and also Clerk to the High Court of Justice) gave the death sentence to Charles I. Today there is a plaque in Maidstone Town Centre describing Andrew as 'Mayor and Regicide' (a killer of kings)."
"Maidstone used to be an industrial area, with paper making and brewing being two of the most important industries, although both have mainly died out in recent years. Until 1998, Sharps Toffee factory was where Bassets liquorice allsorts and other sweets were made. Most of the heavy industry has now been replaced by light and service industries."
Today.
"Today, Maidstone is one of the top five shopping centres in the south east of England, with more than one million square feet of retail space. Most of this is in two shopping areas, ""Fremlin Walk"", which was built on the site of one of the old breweries, is , and ""The Mall Maidstone"" provides another . Both include multi-story car parks."

C. S. Lewis
"Clive Staples Lewis (29 November 1898 – 22 November 1963), usually called C. S. Lewis, was a British scholar who wrote about 40 books. He was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland. He is famous for his fantasy works, essays, and writings on literature and theology. Lewis' theological works are usually apologetics, the defence of Christianity. Some of his most popular Christian writings were ""Mere Christianity"" and ""The Screwtape Letters"". His works have been translated into more than 30 languages. Lewis was a professor of literature at the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge."
Lewis was married to American writer Joy Davidman (1915–1960) from 1956 until her death from bone cancer. He died of renal failure in Oxford.
"His writing is popular with many people, and many of his books were made into movies. His most famous and popular fantasy work is ""The Chronicles of Narnia"", which is a series of seven books."
"He died in Oxford, Oxfordshire, England."
The Corrs
The Corrs is a folk pop rock band from Ireland. There are three sisters and one brother in the quartet. They became very popular in the late 1990s.
The group.
"They were all born in Dundalk, Republic of Ireland, the children of Gerry and Jean Corr."
Jim Corr.
"Jim Corr (born 31 July 1964) is the oldest member of the group. He mainly plays the guitar, but he can also play the on the keyboards and the piano."
"For many games, the Jokers are removed from the deck, making the total number of cards in the deck 52. Sometimes the deck is reduced to 40, 36, or 32 cards for playing certain games, like belote, sheepshead or euchre."
Tarot cards.
"There are various types of tarot cards. Tarots are commonly used for fortune-telling, although they can also be used for playing games. Conversely, people have also used standard playing cards for fortune-telling."
History.
"Playing cards have been found in 9th century China, Tang dynasty."
"Playing cards first entered Europe in the early 14th century, probably from Egypt. The suits were very similar to the tarot suits of Swords, Staves, Cups and Coins. These designs are still used in traditional Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese card decks."
"The first documentary evidence is from Vitoria-Gasteiz (now Spain) in 1334, in which the Knights of the Band are forbidden to play cards. The next record is from Catalonia in 1371."
Wide use of playing cards in Europe can be traced from 1377 onwards.
Manufacture.
"The method of making cards has stayed the same for over a century. Cards are two thin pieces of paper stuck together with black paste. Both outer sides are printed. Inside is the design of the card face, the outer is the design for the pack as a whole. The black paste is essential to prevent sight of the face coming through when light shines on the face side. The use of the paste is the reason cards are sometimes called ""pasteboards""."
"One or two packs at a time are printed on large sheets of paper, already pasted. The individual cards are stamped out by a machine which acts like a cookie-cutter. It cuts 36,000 cards per hour. A tiny fraction of a second later the edges of the cards are squashed extra-thin. This is not obvious to the naked eye, but the effect is that the cards slide easily past each other during shuffling."
"Printed paper cards hold about 97.5% of the world market. Plastic cards do exist: they were first invented in the 1930s. They last longer than papercards, but have only 2.5% of the market."
Emperor
"An emperor is a male who rules an empire. The word is taken from the Latin language ""imperator"". Often it is capitalized."
"A woman who comes to power in an empire is called an ""empress"". The wife of an emperor is also called empress. An emperor or empress is often a hereditary monarch and comes to power when one of his parents, or relatives, dies. In some countries, people elected a new emperor from candidates."
"The only emperor in the world today is the Emperor of Japan (""tennō""), but he lacks political power. The true leaders of Japan are the Diet and Prime Minister because the country is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy."
"The English word comes from Latin, the language of the old Roman Empire. At first, an ""imperator"" was a powerful general (army leader) but, after Augustus, it was only used by their most powerful rulers. There have been many countries in history whose leaders are called ""emperor"" in English. The leaders of the Byzantine Empire (""basileus"", ""autokrator"") in Greece, the Holy Roman Empire (""imperator"", ""Kaiser"") in Austria and Germany, Russian Empire, Serbia and Bulgaria (""tsar""), and the Ottoman Empire (""sultan"", ""padishah"", ""khagan"", ""kaysar"") in Turkey all said they were just new parts of the old Roman Empire."
"The leaders of other countries who said they ruled the whole world or called themselves ""King of Kings"" are frequently also called emperors in English. For example, the old rulers of China (""Huangdi""), Iran (""Shah"") and Ethiopia (""Negusa negast"") are all known as emperors in English. There have also been emperors of France, Brazil and Mexico, and the rulers of the United Kingdom called themselves the Emperors and empresses of India for a while."
"Palmdale, California"
"Palmdale is the largest city in the desert area of California. It is a suburb of Los Angeles. It has a population of 147,897 and is the 6th largest city in Los Angeles County. It is one of the fastest growing cities in the United States, currently the 25th fastest. It has a population of 589,043 if you include the suburbs around it."
"Even though Palmdale is in Los Angeles County, it is not connected to the larger Los Angeles population area. It is separated from it by a mountain range called the San Gabriel Mountains that are over 40 miles wide and almost 2 miles high overall."
"Palmdale is the home of several airplanes used by NASA and the Air Force, giving it the nickname of ""the aerospace capital of America."""
Palmdale is the largest city in the United States without a hospital.
"Palmdale Airport will have one airline called United Airlines that flies to San Francisco, California everyday starting in June 2007."
The city's demographics is primarily Mexican and white.
History.
"In 1886, when land in the Antelope Valley sold for 50 cents an acre, a group of 50 Swiss and German families migrated from the Midwest and settled in what is now known as Palmdale. They named their new community “Palmenthal” because they had mistaken the native Joshua trees for palm trees."
The high desert community of Palmdale has rich agricultural roots and a unique aviation history.
"The City of Palmdale celebrated its 50th anniversary of incorporation on Aug. 24, 2012. It has consistently been one of the fastest-growing cities in California and in the country. Since 1980, Palmdale’s population has soared from 12,277 to 158,605. Despite its growth, Palmdale continues to cherish the small-town values of a family-oriented community while enjoying all of the conveniences of its booming retail and commercial sectors."
"In 1772 Captain Pedro Fages, a Spanish soldier in pursuit of deserting sailors, crossed the southern part of the Antelope Valley into Leona Valley."
Court rulings.
Section 2 has been the source of every Supreme Court ruling directly addressing Twenty-first Amendment issues. Early rulings suggested that Section 2 enabled states to legislate with exceptionally broad constitutional powers.
"In ""State Board of Equalization v. Young's Market Co."", (1936), the Supreme Court held that a state could require a license fee for importing beer from other states and also for manufacturing beer within the state. The court recognized that ""Prior to the Twenty-first Amendment it would obviously have been unconstitutional"" for a state to require a fee for such a privilege."
"In ""Craig v. Boren"" (1976), the Supreme Court addressed the issue of proposed legislation with different ages for males and females regarding alcohol consumption in Oklahoma (age 18 for females, age 21 for males). The Court overturned the motion because of a presumed violation of the Equal Protection Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment."
"In ""South Dakota v. Dole"" (1987), the Supreme Court upheld the withholding of some federal highway funds to states in which the legal drinking age is less than twenty-one years of age is lawful. The Court held that the limitations on spending power in the Twenty-First Amendment did not prohibit Congress to indirectly achieve federal objectives."
"In ""44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island"" (1996), Rhode Island passed a law that banned liquor advertising from places that did not sell liquor. The petitioners based their suit on their First Amendment right to free speech. In a unanimous decision the Court held that states cannot use the Twenty-first Amendment to abridge freedom of speech protections under the First Amendment. However, the Court acknowledged the state was empowered to regulate the sale of liquor under the Twenty-First Amendment."
United States presidential election
"The election of the President and Vice President of the United States is an indirect vote in which citizens cast ballots for a set of members of the U.S. Electoral College. These electors then cast direct votes for the President and Vice President. If both votes result in an absolute majority, the election is over. If a majority of electors do not vote for President, the House of Representatives chooses the President; if a majority of electors do not vote for Vice President, the Senate votes. Presidential elections occur quadrennially on Election Day, which since 1845 has been the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, coinciding with the general elections of various other federal, state, and local races. The most recent United States presidential election was held on November 3, 2020."
Eligibility.
"To be eligible to be president, a candidate must:"

Superman
"Superman is a famous comic book character, and is often known as the first modern superhero character. He was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in 1932, while they were still in high school. He first appeared in ""Action Comics"" issue #1 in 1938. Later, he appeared in movies, television series, cartoons, commercials, video games, and radio shows. Superman is one of the most popular superheroes, he is also in the DC Comics. As a superhero he does not want to kill anyone. But he was forced to kill his nemesis general Zod as Zod was about to kill people. Like other characters in the DC Universe, there have been several alternative versions of Superman over the years. Several actors have played Superman in motion pictures and TV series including Bud Collyer, Kirk Alyn, George Reeves, Christopher Reeve, Dean Cain, Tim Daly, Tom Welling, Brandon Routh, Henry Cavill, and Tyler Hoechlin."
Superman's Real Life Origins.
"Mr. Siegel imagined an evil villain who read minds and dreamed of conquering the world. He went by the name of the Superman. In the 1930s, Hitler, the infamous nazi villain from real life, was talking about getting rid of the Jews and communists. This was because he believed that Germans he called Aryans were supermen. Mr. Siegel, who was Jewish, found this disgusting. But one night, Mr. Siegel tossed and turned in his bed, and had a horrible time getting to sleep. When he awoke, Superman became the superman we know today, and the evil version disappeared."
Story.
"Superman was born on a planet called Krypton. His name was Kal-El. When his father, Jor-El, found out that their planet was going to explode, Jor-El sent his baby son to Earth in a spacecraft to save him. Kal-El was found and adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent. They named him Clark Kent. The Kents raised him as their own son in a town called Smallville, Kansas in the United States. (There is a television series called ""Smallville"" about his time growing up there)"
"As he grows up, Clark finds out that he has special powers. He is almost invulnerable (most things cannot hurt him). He is strong enough to lift almost anything and he can fly. Superman can also run and move faster than a bullet. He has X-ray vision (he can see through walls, he is not able to see through lead), and heat vision (shooting heat from his eyes). He can freeze things with his frost breath and his super-breath (which allows him to blow super hard). He decides to use his special powers to fight crime and save people in danger. He wears a blue and red costume and cape to keep his alter ego (his real name) a secret. He saves the entire world many times."
"Superman moves to a city called Metropolis, and becomes a reporter for the Daily Planet, a newspaper. He falls in love with another reporter, Lois Lane."
"His weaknesses are radioactive rocks from his home planet that are called ""kryptonite""; and magic. Sometimes his enemies use it to hurt him. Diffferent Kryptoinites have different effects on him, Blue Kryptonite makes people able to control him using hypnosis, green weakens his powers and slowly kills him, black makes him evil, and red has many different effects on him (each piece of red kryptonite affects him differently). There is also gold, white, and jewel kryptonite. Some of Superman's enemies use magic to hurt him."
Affiliations.
Enemies.
"His most well known arch enemy is a bald (hairless), evil genius named Lex Luthor. He has other deadly enemies too. Bizarro is a failed duplicate of superman. Darkseid is a very powerful enemy, and the ruler of the planet Apokolips. Another enemy includes General Zod who comes from the same planet as Superman."
Teams.
"Superman also founded the Justice League of America alongside Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Green Lantern, The Flash, Hawkgirl, Hawkman, and Martian Manhunter."
Camellia
"Camellia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Theaceae, native to eastern and southern Asia from the Himalaya east to Japan and Indonesia. Scientists are still discussing how many species there are. The number of species varies between 100 and 250. Linnaeus named the genus inhonour of Fr. Georg Joseph Kamel, a Jesuit botanist. amel brought C. japonica from Manila to Spain."
"They are evergreen shrubs and small trees from 2–20 m tall. The leaves are alternately arranged, simple, thick, serrated, usually glossy, and 3–17 cm long. The flowers are large and conspicuous, 1–12 cm diameter, with (in natural conditions) 5–9 petals; colour varies from white to pink and red, and yellow in a few species. The fruit is a dry capsule subdivided into 1–5 compartments, each containing 1–8 seeds."
"The genus is generally adapted to acidic soils, and does not grow well on chalk or other calcium-rich soils. Most species also have a high rainfall requirement and will not tolerate drought."
"""Camellia"" species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of butterfly species."
Cultivation and uses.
"""Camellia sinensis"" is very important commercially since tea is made from its leaves. Tea oil is a sweet seasoning and cooking oil made by pressing the seeds of ""Camellia sinensis"" or ""Camellia oleifera""."
"Many other camellias are grown as ornamental plants for their flowers; about 3,000 cultivars and hybrids have been selected, many with double flowers, as in the gallery below. ""Camellia japonica"" (often simply called Camellia) is the most prominent species in cultivation, with over 2,000 named cultivars; next are ""C. reticulata"", with over 400 named cultivars, and ""C. sasanqua"", with over 300 named cultivars. Popular hybrids include ""C. × hiemalis"" (""C. japonica"" × ""C. sasanqua"") and ""C. × williamsii"" (""C. japonica"" × ""C. salouenensis""). They are highly valued in Japan and elsewhere for their very early flowering, often among the first flowers to appear in the late winter. Late frosts can damage the flowers."
Camellias have a slow growth rate. Typically they will grow about 30 centimetres a year until mature although this varies depending on variety and location.
"""Camellia japonica"" is the state flower of Alabama as well as the city flower of the Chinese municipality Chongqing."
Magnolia
Magnolia can mean:
Queen Esther discovered the plot by Haman and worked to stop it. She invited the king to dine with Haman present so she could tell him about the plot. But her courage failed her and she said nothing.
"She again invited King Ahaseurus and Haman to dine and this time she told the king of Haman's plot. The king, furious, stormed out and Haman begged Esther for mercy. When the king returned, he mistakenly believed Haman had molested his queen, and had him hanged on the same gallows that Haman had prepared for Mordecai. In the end, thanks to Esther's courage and influence, the king changed the law and saved the Jewish people."
Clay
"Clay is a fine-grained silicate mineral made when rocks break down. Wet clay is soft and can be shaped to make pottery, bricks and other things. When it is shaped and then fired in a kiln to make it hard, it becomes pottery."
Clay often contains some water because the water molecules stick to the tiny grains. There may also be some organic materials in the clay.
"There are 35 recognized clay mineral species on Earth, they make muds stick together ('cohesive'), or able to flow ('plastic'). The thixotropy of clay sometimes causes landslides."
"Quartz, feldspars, iron oxides, and carbonates can weather to sizes of a typical clay mineral. The formation of clay is well understood. It can come from soil, volcanic ash, and glaciation. Ancient mudrocks are another source, because they weather and disintegrate easily."
"Clay is by far the smallest particles recognized in mudrocks. A clay particle is about 1/1000th the width of a sand grain. This means a clay particle will travel 1000 times further at constant water velocity, thus requiring quieter conditions for settlement. Where the grains are more than a few millimeters wide, the material is called silt, not clay."
Rifle
The rifle is a gun with a stock to brace against the shoulder and a barrel with twisting grooves. The grooves are called rifling and make bullets spin as they fly through the air. Rifles are made to shoot many different sizes of bullets using different amounts of gunpowder. Rifles are usually made to be able to hit targets at long ranges. Modern rifles are made for many different purposes. Some are made for hunting animals. Some are made for soldiers to use in war. Others are made for police to have in case they need them. Some rifles are made for target shooting.
Types.
"Rifles can work in different ways. Some rifles have what is called a bolt action. A small handle is used to move a part of the rifle called a ""bolt"". By moving the bolt backward, then forward, allows the shooter put a bullet in the chamber ready for firing. It also ejects any spent shells still in the chamber from any previously fired rounds. The rifle in the picture above is a bolt action. Some rifles are semi-automatics, where a bullet is loaded (automatically) and fired each time the trigger is pulled. Some are fully automatic, which work like semi-automatics but allow the shooter to fire more than one bullet at a time by holding down the trigger. The automatic rifle stops firing when the trigger is released or it runs out of ammunition."
Deuterocanonical books
"[WARNING, THE FOLLOWING MAY CONTAIN ERRORS]Deuterocanonical books means ""second canon"" in Greek. It usually means the parts of the Bible that are only used by some Christian churches (mostly Roman Catholic and Orthodox). The books only exist in Greek language manuscripts that were written by the Jewish people living in Greek speaking areas of the Mediterranean Sea between 250 and 50 BC, as were all of the books of the Old Testament. It was not until circa 900 AD that the Old Testament as known in Jewish and Protestant religions was written in Hebrew and limited to the current so-called ""canons"".[citation needed, see dead sea scrolls]"
"The books are not part of the Jewish Tanakh (also called the ""Hebrew Bible""), although they were quoted as Scripture well into the Middle Ages as is found in the Jewish Mishna and later Rabbinical writings, even into the 6th century AD. The current Jewish canon was closed by the time of the Masoretic Text in the 10th century AD."
Some books considered deuterocanonical by Catholics are:
"The ""Book of Daniel"" and the ""Book of Esther"" are longer in Catholic Bibles than in Protestant Bibles because they have more stories."
"Many, but not all Protestant churches do not accept these books as inspired by God and use the derogatory term for them: Apocrypha. Martin Luther considered these books good to read while John Calvin read and studied them but did not think they should be part of the Bible. The Catholic Church, the Orthodox Church,"
1247
1247 was a Year starting on a Tuesday of the Julian Calendar
Sidekick
"A sidekick is someone who regularly travels with, and helps, another person. In fiction, the other person is often a crimefighter or superhero, such as Batman and his sidekick Robin. Some people consider Sancho Panza, Don Quixote's ever-faithful companion, to be a type of sidekick, even though the book was written long before the word sidekick was invented. Annabeth Chase is nobody's sidekick."
Jurist
A jurist (from medieval Latin) is someone who researches and studies jurisprudence (theory of law).
Nicobar Islands
"Korean uses two different writing systems. One is Hangul, the main alphabet. In North Korea, only Hangeul (Known as Choseongeul in North Korea) is used by law. In South Korea, only Hangeul should be used in most public areas like education, but the other system, Hanja, is still used in some newspapers and professional areas. Hanja is the system of Chinese characters that are used in Korean. It was the only way to write Korean before the creation of Hangeul in the 15th century, and it was common in novels before the 19th century."
"Although King Sejong the Great led the development of Hangeul to allow literacy to spread among common people and to create a writing system that represented the language more accurately than Hanja, it was not adopted by the upper classes of Koreans. Hanja would continue to be the official writing system until the late 19th century. Although it was rejected by the elite classes, Hangeul was used often by lower classes as a way to write down Korean literature and for lower classes to communicate."
Kansas
"Kansas () is a state in the Midwestern United States of America. The name of the state comes from the Kansa Native Americans, whose name comes from a Siouan-language phrase meaning ""people of the south wind"". The land that would become Kansas was bought in the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Kansas's capital is Topeka, and its biggest city is Wichita."
"Kansas was first settled by Americans in 1827 when Fort Leavenworth was built. In the 1850s, many more people came to live in Kansas. This was also when people were fighting about slavery. People were allowed to move to Kansas in 1854 because of the Kansas–Nebraska Act. When this happened, anti-slavery Free-Staters from New England and pro-slavery people from Missouri quickly came to Kansas. They wanted to decide whether Kansas would become a free state or a slave state. Because of this, a lot of fighting happened, and it was known as Bleeding Kansas. The anti-slavery people won. On January 29, 1861, Kansas entered the Union as a free state."
"Kansas is in a region known as ""America's Breadbasket"". Like other states in this area, Kansas makes a lot of corn, sorghum, soybeans, and wheat; they make one-fifth of all wheat grown in the United States. Kansas has other industries too, including aviation and communications. Kansas has an area of , which is the 15th-biggest state by area. Kansas is also 34th most-populous of the 50 states because 2,913,314 people live there. People who live in Kansas are called ""Kansans"". Mount Sunflower is Kansas's highest place at ."
The terrain of Kansas consists of prairies and forests. All of Kansas is in the Great Plains.
Etymology.
"The name ""Kansas"" comes from the Algonquian term, ""Akansa"", for the Quapaw people. These were a Dhegiha Siouan-speaking people who moved to Arkansas around the 13th century. The stem -""kansa"" is named after the Kaw people. They are also known as the ""Kansa"", a federally recognized Native American tribe."
History.
Early history.
"In 1539, Marcos de Niza, a friar, reported rumors of Cíbola, a city of gold, to Spanish colonial officials in Mexico City. Niza said the city was in modern-day New Mexico. In response to the rumors, two years later, Francisco Vázquez de Coronado, with an army of 3000 Spaniards and 8001 Mexicans, marched northward from Culiacán in hopes of finding the city. When Coronado did not find the city in New Mexico, he continued northeast into the Mississippi Valley, crossing the present area of Kansas diagonally. This made Conrado and his army the first Europeans to see the Great Plains, including Kansas. Later, Juan de Oñate also traveled to Kansas in 1601."
"In 1682, Jacques Marquette, Louis Jolliet, Louis Hennepin and other French leaders took formal control of the Mississippi Valley, including the land that would become Kansas. This land, known as the Louisiana territory, was used to organize trade with Native Americans. In 1763, France ceded the Louisiana territory to Spain."
"Between 1763 and 1803 the territory of Kansas was integrated into the Spanish Louisiana. The governor Luis de Unzaga 'le Conciliateur', during that period, promoted expeditions and good relations with the indians tribes, among the explorers were Antoine de Marigny and others who continued trading across the Kansas River, especially at its confluence with the Missouri River, tributaries of the Mississippi River."
"However, in 1803, Spain receded the territory back to France in the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso. On April 30, 1803, Napoleon sold the Louisiana territory to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase. In the early 1800s, Kansas was used to hold Native Americans that were removed from their native lands."
Statehood.
"On May 30, 1854, the Congress signed the Kansas-Nebraska Act. The Kansas-Nebraska Act stated that Kansas and Nebraska were both territories of the United States. It also stated that Kansans would vote on the legality of slavery."
"Upon hearing this, about 1,200 armed New Englanders came to Kansas to vote against slavery. However, thousands of southerners, mostly from Missouri, came to vote for slavery. The final vote was to make slavery legal, and Kansas adopted most of Missouri's slave laws. There was fighting between Southerners and Northerners in Kansas. In one fight, John Brown and his men killed five people in the Pottawatomie Massacre. Later, Southerners destroyed Lawrence, Kansas. Kansas was called ""Bleeding Kansas""."
"Between 1854 and 1861, Kansas proposed four state constitutions. Out of the four proposed constitutions, three did not allow slavery. Finally, in July 1859, Kansas passed the Wyandotte Constitution, which was anti-slavery. The constitution for statehood was sent to the U.S. government in April 1860 to be voted on. The constitution was passed by the House of Representatives, but rejected by the Senate. This is because southern voters in the Senate did not like that Kansas would become a state without slavery. In 1861, after the Confederate states formed, the constitution gained approval from the Union, and Kansas became a state."
Kansas in the Civil War.
"Four months after Kansas became a state, the Civil War started. Out of the 381 battles in the Civil War, four were fought in Kansas. Throughout the war, Kansas remained a Union state."
"On August 21, 1863, William Clarke Quantrill led a force of 300 to 400 Confederates into the town of Lawrence, Kansas. Quantrill and his troops burned, looted, and destroyed the anti-slavery town. This battle became known as the Lawrence Massacre. In total, 164 Union soldiers and 40 Confederate soldiers died in the Lawrence Massacre. In the Battle of Mine Creek, on October 25, 1864, Union soldiers attacked Confederates as they were crossing the Mine Creek. The Union surrounded the Confederates, and captured 600 men and two generals. 1,000 Confederate soldiers and 100 Union soldiers died in the battle. In total, 8,500 people from Kansas died or were wounded in the Civil War."
Post Civil War.
"After the Civil War, many free slaves came to Oklahoma and Kansas. In fact, between the years of 1879 and 1881, about 60,000 African Americans came to this region. This is because the slaves wanted economic opportunities, which they believed awaited them in Kansas. African Americans also came to Kansas for better political rights and to escape sharecropping. These people were called ""Exodusters."""
Recent history.
Dust Bowl.
"From 1930 to 1936, Kansas went through a period of time called the Dust Bowl. During this time, Kansas had little rainfall and high temperatures. Thousands of farmers became very poor and had to move to other parts of the United States. In total, 400,000 people left the Great Plains area. The years from 1930 to 1940 was the only time the population of Kansas went down. The number of people living in Kansas decreased 4.3 percent."
"Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas."
"During the 1950s, school segregation was required in fifteen U.S states. However, Kansas was not one of these states. Instead, school segregation was permitted by local option, but only in elementary schools. In 1896, the ruling from ""Plessy v. Ferguson"" stated that segregation was allowed, but equal facilities should be made available for blacks and whites. Often, however, black schools received less funding and had fewer textbooks than white schools."
"For these reasons, Linda Brown and her family sued the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas. Brown won the case, and the ruling was to overturn the ""Plessy v. Ferguson"" decision. This was considered by many a landmark case in the civil rights movement."
Geography.
"Vrilissia is a twin city of Naples, Italy and Ottweiler in Germany. In Ottweiler, a main bridge is named after the Greek city."
Squall
"A squall is a quick and big increase in wind speed which is usually linked to weather such as rain showers, thunderstorms, or heavy snow."
Oxford English Dictionary
"The Oxford English Dictionary (or OED) is a dictionary. It is published by the Oxford University Press in England, and is the largest English dictionary."
"It traces (or follows in detail) the historical development of the English language, and is a resource to writers and scholars. It describes how the language has been used."
"The second edition came to 21,728 pages in 20 volumes, published in 1989. Number of main entries is 231,100 and number of main entries for out-of -date words is 47,100."
"Work began on the dictionary in 1857, but it was not until 1884 that it began to be published in parts, under the name of ""A New English Dictionary on historical principles; founded mainly on the materials collected by the Philological Society"". In 1895, the title ""The Oxford English Dictionary"" (""OED"") was first used unofficially on the covers of the series, and in 1928 the full dictionary was republished in ten bound volumes. In 1933, ""The Oxford English Dictionary"" was reprinted as twelve volumes with a one-volume supplement. More supplements came over the years until 1989, when the second edition was published. Since 2000, a third edition of the dictionary has been underway, approximately a third of which is now complete."
"The first electronic version of the dictionary was done in 1988. The online version has been available since 2000, and as of April 2014 was receiving over two million hits per month. The third edition of the dictionary will probably only appear in electronic form; Nigel Portwood, chief executive of Oxford University Press, feels it unlikely that it will ever be printed."
Thomas Beecham
"Sir Thomas Beecham (born St Helens, Lancashire, 29 April 1879; died London, 8 March 1961) was an English conductor. He was one of the most famous conductors of his time. He came from a very rich family and was able to use his money to pay orchestras that he formed. He formed the London Philharmonic Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. He was especially well known for conducting the music of Mozart as well as that of his friend Delius."
He often made funny jokes and many amusing stories are told about things that he said.
Early life.
"Beecham was born in 1879 in St. Helens, Lancashire in the north of England. Beecham was self-taught as a conductor. He had some private composition lessons from Charles Wood in London and Moszkowski in Paris. Beecham’s father, Sir Joseph Beecham, had made a lot of money making medicines (the famous Beecham pills) and he also liked music, so he was able to help his son in his career as a musician."
"Thomas was only 20 years old when his father was reinstated as mayor of St. Helens. To celebrate this, his father paid for the Hallé Orchestra to give a concert. It was going to be conducted by the famous German conductor Hans Richter. However, a few days before the concert it was announced that Richter was ill. Thomas immediately said he would conduct the concert. The orchestra at first refused to play for a 20 year old who had only once ever conducted a concert, but in the end they changed their minds and the concert was a great success."
Early career.
"In 1909 Thomas got a group of musicians together to form the Beecham Symphony Orchestra. They gave concerts and played for ballets and operas. Beecham conducted operas in Covent Garden and other London opera houses. He conducted works by composers such as Strauss, Delius, Smythe and Holbrooke. He also played for Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes when they first came to England."
"During World War I he gave money to the Halle Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic Society, all of which he conducted. He often conducted these orchestras outside London, giving people the chance to hear music they had never heard before."
"For several years he had money problems and did not conduct much. Then, in 1932, he formed the London Philharmonic Orchestra and quickly made it into an excellent orchestra. They toured Germany in 1936 and the next year went to Paris. During the 1930s he conducted at Covent Garden where he had control of everything that went on. He conducted several cycles of Wagner’s Ring. When World War II started in 1939 the theatre was closed. He went to the United States where he conducted several orchestras including the New York Philharmonic. He also went to Australia."
Later career.
"In 1944 he returned to Britain. His orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, were now a self-governing body (the members themselves made decisions about what the orchestra should do and play). They decided that they did not want Beecham because he would want to have power to rule the orchestra in the way he wanted. So Beecham formed another orchestra: the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. He gave many concerts, toured with them and made many great recordings. He was especially known for his concerts of Joseph Haydn and Mozart. He also conducted Die Meistersinger at Covent Garden in 1951 as well as appearing at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires in 1958. The last concert he gave was on 7 May 1960 when he conducted the RPO in Portsmouth."
His fame.
"Beecham was an enormously talented musician. Because he had a lot of money he did not need to go through the musical education that most other musicians have. He formed his own life, and spent a lot of his energy as well as money creating the right conditions for musicians to work in, conditions that would have been normal in many other European countries, but which were not normal at the time in England."
"He was not interested in the music of Bach, though he did conduct Handel. He was famous for his Mozart performances, and particularly enjoyed playing Berlioz, Mendelssohn, Bizet and Dvořák. He was one of the first people in England to conduct the new music of Richard Strauss and Sibelius. He was a close friend of Delius and performed his music as well as editing it so that it could be published."
There are many stories about the witty things that he said. He was knighted in 1916.
Famous quotations.
A lady told Beecham that she wanted her son to learn to play a musical instrument but did not want to hear the awful sound it made when he was beginning to learn. She asked him what instrument he should learn. Beecham said he should learn the bagpipes because “they sound exactly the same when you have finished learning them as when you start learning them”.
Beecham was rehearsing a very long opera by Wagner. They had been rehearsing for a long time. Beecham took out his watch and said: “My God! We have been playing for two hours and we are still playing this bloody tune!”
"Beecham was rehearsing an opera by an English composer. The composer was at the rehearsal, and kept stopping the orchestra and asking Beecham to play it differently. Each time Beecham turned back to the orchestra and said: “The same again, gentlemen, please”."
"Nitrogen compounds have many uses, such as anesthetics (nitrous oxide), explosives (dynamite), cleaners (ammonia), and meat (protein), and planes (fuel)."
Oil companies use high pressure nitrogen to help force crude oil to the surface.
Nitrogen is also used as a way to relieve body aches. It contributes to the torn bones in your body and helps.
History.
"Nitrogen was discovered by Daniel Rutherford in 1772, who called it ""noxious gas"" or ""fixed gas"". They discovered that part of air did not burn. It was found that animals died in it. It was known as ""azote"". Many nitrogen compounds also contain the ""azide"" or ""azine"" letters, such as hydrazine."
"In 1910, Lord Rayleigh found out that when a spark was passed through nitrogen, it made a reactive form of nitrogen. This nitrogen reacted with many metals and compounds."
Association football
"Association football is a sport played between two teams. In the United States, Canada and Australia, it is called soccer. In most other English-speaking countries it is called football. Association football is the most popular sport in the world."
"Games like football have been played around the world since ancient times. The modern game came from England, where the Football Association wrote a standard set of rules for the game in 1863."
"Each team has 11 players on the field. One of these players is the goalkeeper, the only player who is allowed to touch the ball with their hands. The other ten are known as ""outfield players"". The players try to kick the ball into their opponents' goal. The team that scores the most goals wins. A match has 90 minutes of play, with a break of 15 minutes during the match. The break in the middle is called ""half-time"". Added time may be added after half time or after 90 minutes to make up for time lost during the game because of fouls, free kicks, corner kicks, injuries, bookings, substitutions or any other time the game is stopped. A match can end in a tie, except in some competition games where one team must win. In that case, extra-time with two halves of 15 minutes each may be played, and if there is still a tie, a penalty shootout decides the winner. Sometimes extra-time is skipped and the game goes right into the penalty shootout."
Competitions.
"There are many competitions for football, for both football clubs and countries. Football clubs usually play other teams in their own country, with a few exceptions. Here are a list of some of those exceptions:"
Football clubs also play other teams in their continent in competitions such as the CAF Champions League and the UEFA Champions League.
"There are 6 associations (CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, CAF, UEFA, AFC, and OFC). Each association has their own continental competition between clubs and national teams. Some examples are the Copa América for CONMEBOL national teams and the Copa Libertadores for CONMEBOL clubs. FIFA organises international competitions between worldwide clubs and countries. Clubs play in the Club World Cup, and countries play for the FIFA World Cup."
"The FIFA World Cup takes place every four years between national teams, and is the world's most popular sporting event, even more popular than the Olympic Games. In football, there are two main competition types. In a ""league"", all of the teams play the same number of games, but in a ""cup"", teams leave the competition when they lose, until the last two teams play each other to decide the winner."
Who plays football.
"Football is the world's most popular sport. It is played in more countries than any other game. In fact, FIFA (the Federation Internationale de Football Association) has more members than the United Nations. It was originally an all-male sport, but today it is played by both males and females (separately, except sometimes at primary school level)."
"In Europe, the main competitions to compete are the Champions League for the top teams from the top leagues in each country in Europe. Then there is the UEFA Europa League which is for the next best teams from each member country of the UEFA."
"Most successful clubs are FC Barcelona and Real Madrid from Spain; Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund from Germany; Galatasaray S.K. from Turkey; Juventus, AC Milan and Inter Milan from Italy; Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City from England; Paris Saint-Germain from France and Al Ahly from Egypt."
"The most successful club in the world, in terms of domestic league results, is Rangers F.C. from Scotland, who have won more domestic league titles than any other team in the world. They have won the country's league 54 times which is a world record. In May 2000, Rangers became the first team to win 100 trophies."
Spamming
"Spamming is when one person or company sends an unwanted email to another person. Spam emails are the computer version of unwanted ""junk mail"" that arrives in a mailbox, such as advertising pamphlets and brochures. Spam emails are usually sent to try to get the person to buy something or do something else that will cause gain for the sender."
Names.
"The emails sent when someone is spamming is called spam. The person or company who sent the unwanted email is called a spammer. Both of these words came from a brand of canned meat called ""Spam"", but it was a short sketch created by the British comedy group Monty Python in 1970 that led to the word ""Spam"" being widely used to mean unwanted email messages."
Uses.
"Spam emails are usually sent to many people at once trying to get them to buy a product or sign up for a service. The people who receive the email did not ask to receive the email, and do not want to receive it."
"One of the reasons there is so much spam emails around is that it costs very little to send millions of spam messages at once. Spam messages can easily be sent, sometimes even by a special computer program."
How spammers find email addresses.
"The hardest part about spamming is to get the email addresses to send the spam to. Sometimes the spammers do this by searching for emails on the internet, or by buying emails from people who know a lot of them (for example, someone who runs a site that makes users tell them their email address to signup will have a lot of email addresses to sell to spammers)."
Method one.
The entire country has about 22 million people. These 14 cities have 5 million total. This shows that most people still live in rural areas.
Divisions.
"Mozambique is divided into ten provinces (""provincias"") and one capital city (""cidade capital"") with provincial status. The provinces are divided into 129 districts (""distritos""). The districts are further divided in 405 ""Postos Administrativos"" (Administrative Posts) and then into Localidades (Localities), the lowest geographical level of the central state administration. Since 1998, 43 ""Municípios"" (Municipalities) have been created in Mozambique."
Culture.
Arts.
"The music of Mozambique can be for many purposes. These can be religious or for traditional ceremonies. Musical instruments are usually handmade. Some of the instruments used include drums made of wood and animal skin; the ""lupembe"", a woodwind instrument made from animal horns or wood; and the marimba, which is a kind of xylophone native to Mozambique. The marimba is a popular instrument with the Chopi of the south central coast. They are famous for their musical skill and dance."
"The Makonde are renowned for their wood carving and elaborate masks that are commonly used in traditional dances. There are two different kinds of wood carvings. Shetani, (evil spirits), which are mostly carved in heavy ebony, tall, and elegantly curved with symbols and nonrepresentational faces. The Ujamaa are totem-type carvings which show lifelike faces of people and various figures. Theses sculptures are usually called “family trees” because they tell stories of many generations."
"During the last years of the colonial period, Mozambican art showed the oppression by the colonial power, and became a symbol of the resistance. After independence in 1975, the modern art came into a new phase. The two best known and most influential contemporary Mozambican artists are the painter Malangatana Ngwenya and the sculptor Alberto Chissano. Art during the 1980s and 1990s shows the political struggle, civil war, suffering, starvation and struggle."
"Dances are usually highly developed traditions throughout Mozambique. There are many different kinds of dances from tribe to tribe which are usually ritualistic in nature. The Chopi, for instance, act out battles dressed in animal skins. The men of Makua dress in colourful outfits and masks while dancing on stilts around the village for hours. Groups of women in the northern part of the country have a traditional dance called ""tufo"", to celebrate Islamic holidays."
Food.
"Because the Portuguese were there for nearly 500 years, they greatly impacted the cuisine of Mozambique. Crops such as cassava (a starchy root) and cashew nuts (Mozambique was once the largest producer of these nuts), and ""pãozinho"" were brought in by the Portuguese. The use of spices and seasonings such as onions, bay leaves, garlic, fresh coriander, paprika, chili peppers, red sweet peppers, and wine were introduced by the Portuguese. So was sugarcane, maize, millet, rice, sorghum (a type of grass), and potatoes. ""Prego"" (steak roll), ""rissois"" (battered shrimp), ""espetada"" (kebab), ""pudim"" (pudding), and the popular ""inteiro com piripiri"" (whole chicken in piri-piri sauce) are all Portuguese dishes commonly eaten in present-day Mozambique."
Entertainment.
Football is the most popular sport in Mozambique.
Dian Fossey
"Dian Fossey (January 16, 1932 – December 26, 1985) was an American zoologist. She is best known for studying gorillas in Rwanda."
"Fossey was inspired by a book called ""The Mountain Gorilla"" by George Schaller. Fossey studied mountain gorillas in Rwanda because of the book. When people want to get close to gorillas and get to know them they have to gain the gorillas trust. Fossey changed her lifestyle to match the gorillas’. She wanted to protect the gorillas from hunters. Hunters were going into places where to one was allowed to hunt. She also wanted to protect the endangered animals in the area, even though some people didn’t agree with her ideas. She is a hero to many people for what she did to help mountain gorillas. There is a movie that was made based on what she experienced in Africa. The movie is called ""Gorillas in the Mist"". Her book, also named ""Gorillas in the Mist"", is the best-selling book on gorillas of all time."
She is recognized for saving mountain gorillas and starting a successful fund to help raise money for gorillas everywhere.
Early life.
Fossey was born in San Francisco. She was an only child. She was very lonely as a child. Her parents divorced when she was six years old. Fossey loved animals since childhood but she was never allowed to have a pet.
Education.
She attended the University of California in Davis. At college she was in a veterinary program. She transferred schools to San Jose State University after two years. Fossey earned a bachelor degree of arts degree in occupational therapy. She became a very good horseback rider in college. She worked at a hospital in Kentucky for disabled children. Fossey was inspired by a book about mountain gorillas. She decided to travel to Africa to study gorillas. She met Louis Leakey who is a famous anthropologist. Leakey hired Fossey study gorillas for a long time. Fossey observed gorillas for many years. Fossey later earned a PhD from Cambridge College in England. The PhD was for her gorilla research.
Assassination.
"Fossey was found dead in her house on December 26, 1985 at the age of 53. Reports think that she was killed by poachers. Her head was cut by a panga, a weapon used by poachers. Fossey was buried at the site she created as a graveyard for the gorillas."
Legacy.
"Fossey studied the lives of mountain gorillas for 18 years. She was the world’s expert on mountain gorillas. Her dedication allowed for mountain gorillas to continue as a species. Some of the people who lived in the area did not like her because of her thoughts on how the gorillas should be treated. She did not want them to be in zoos, harassed by tourists, harmed or killed for meat."
Maryland
"Maryland is a state in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States of America. It is on the south-east of the East Coast. Its capital is Annapolis, and its biggest city is Baltimore."
The governor of Maryland is Larry Hogan. He was elected in the 2014 election. Hogan was re-elected during the 2018 election.
"The state bird is the Baltimore Oriole. The state flower is the Black-eyed Susan (""Rudbeckia hirta""). The state reptile is the diamondback terrapin. The state crustacean is the blue crab. The state motto is ""Fatti maschii, parole femine"", which is Italian for ""Manly deeds, womanly words"". Maryland is the only state with a motto in Italian."
"Maryland has many places important to the American Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, and the American Civil War. One of these places is Fort McHenry, which defended against the British Empire during the War of 1812. Another place is the Antietam National Battlefield, where the Battle of Antietam took place in 1862 during the American Civil War."
Medina
"Medina (; , ' , ""the radiant city""; or , ' (), ""the city""), also transliterated as Madīnah, is a city in the Hejaz, and the capital of the Al Madinah Region of Saudi Arabia. The city contains al-Masjid al-Nabawi (""the Prophet's Mosque""), which is the burial place of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and is the second-holiest city in Islam after Mecca."
"Medina was Muhammad's destination after his Hijrah from Mecca, and became the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim Empire, first under Muhammad's leadership, and then under the first four Rashidun caliphs, Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali. It served as the power base of Islam in its first century where the early Muslim community developed. Medina is home to the three oldest mosques, namely the Quba Mosque, al-Masjid an-Nabawi, and Masjid al-Qiblatayn (""the mosque of the two qiblas""). Muslims believe that the chronologically final surahs of the Quran were revealed to Muhammad in Medina, and are called Medinan surahs in contrast to the earlier Meccan surahs."
"Similar to Mecca, non-Muslims are forbidden from entering the sacred core of Medina or the center of the city."
Overview.
"Medina currently has a population of more than 1,300,000 people (2006). The city was originally known as ""Yathrib"", but later its name was changed to Madīnat al-Nabī (مدينة ﺍﻟﻨﺒﻲ ""city of the prophet"") or ""Al Madīnah al Munawwarah"" (""the enlightened city"" or ""the radiant city""). The short form ""Madīnah"" simply means ""city"". Madina is the second holiest city of Islam, after Mecca (Makkah)."
Medina's religious significance in Islam.
"Medina is very important to Muslims. This is because the Prophet Muhammad is buried in a mosque known as 'Masjid-e-Nabawi' or 'The Mosque of The Prophet'. The Mosque was built on a site next to Muhammad's home. Muslims believe that Prophets must be buried at the very same place that they die. Accordingly, Muhammad was buried in his house. The tomb later became part of the mosque when it was expanded by the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid I. The first mosque of Islam is also in Medina. It is known as ""Masjid Quba,"" (the Quba Mosque)."
"Like Mecca, the city of Medina only permits Muslims to enter. The ""haram"" (area closed to non-Muslims) of Medina is much smaller than that of Mecca, though. Many facilities on the outskirts of Medina are open to non-Muslims. In Mecca the area closed to non-Muslims extends well beyond the limits of the built-up area. Both cities' numerous mosques are the destination for large numbers of Muslims on their annual pilgrimage. Hundreds of thousands of Muslims come to Medina each year to visit the 'Tomb of Prophet' and to worship at mosques in a unified celebration. Muslims believe that praying once in the Mosque of the Prophet is equal to praying at least 1000 times in any other mosque."
Doctrine
"Doctrine (Latin: ""doctrina"") is a code of beliefs or ""a body of teachings""."
Doctrine often means several religious dogmas that a church teaches.
"But it can also mean a principle of law, in the common law traditions, established through a history of past decisions, such as the doctrine of self-defense, or the principle of fair use."
"In matters of foreign policy, a doctrine, also known as dogma, is group of fundamental rules for a nation's foreign policy. Examples include the Monroe Doctrine, the Stimson Doctrine, the Truman Doctrine, the Eisenhower Doctrine, the Nixon Doctrine, the Brezhnev Doctrine, the Kirkpatrick doctrine, and the Bush Doctrine."
Religious usage.
Examples of religious doctrines include:
One department of the Roman Curia is called the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.
Military usage.
"The term also applies to the concept of an established procedure to a complex operation in warfare. The typical example is tactical doctrine in which a standard set of maneuvers, kinds of troops and weapons are employed as a default approach to a kind of attack."
Examples of military doctrines include:
Citron
"The citron (""Citrus medica"") is a species of citrus fruit. It usually has a thick rind and small sections. Originally, the tree came from Southeast Asia. Today it is mainly grown in Sicily, Morocco, Crete, and Corsica, as well as Puerto Rico. The tree can grow to a size of about 3 metres. The fruit can grow to a size of about 25 cm in length, and about 4 kg in weight. The pulp of the fruit is hardly ever used. The rind is used. It is made into an additive for cooking. Jam can also be made from the rind. The rind is also used to make vegetable oil, which is used for perfumes."
"Generally, it is eaten preserved or in bakery goods, such as fruitcakes. (The candied peel rather than the fruit is often used in cooking.) In some cultures, it is made into a fruity tea. Pliny the Elder states that in his time , the citron could only be grown in Media and Persia (""HN"" xii.7). The Romans tried to transport it into the Roman Empire in tightly packed pots, but failed, according to Pliny. There is evidence, however, which shows it was cultivated in the Mediterranean during Pliny's lifetime. Zohary and Hopf believe this tree was first domesticated in India. They think that its wild forms, along with those of the mandarin and pomelo, were the original citrus species."
"The citron has many names in different countries; one popular reference is ""Cedrat"", which is the French name for the fruit. Theophrastus referred to the citron as the Persian or Median Apple, and the fruit later came to be known as the Citrus Apple. Pliny calls the tree the Assyrian, or the Median, ""apple"" (the generic Greco-Roman name for globose fruits). Other citrus crops were not introduced to the Mediterranean basin until Islamic times."
"In many languages other than English, a normal lemon is called a ""citron"" and a Lime is called a ""limon"". Although the East Asian citrus fruit ""yuzu"" (also called ""yuja"") is sometimes called a citron, it is actually a separate species, ""Citrus junos""."
Cultivation and uses.
"The citron fruit is slow-growing. The citron tree is typically grown from cuttings that are two to four years old; the tree begins to bear fruit when it is around three years old. The fruit is oblong in shape, and sometimes as much as six inches in length. Its skin is thick, somewhat hard, fragrant, and covered with protuberances; the pulp is white and subacid."
"In Pliny's time the fruit was never eaten (it began to be used in cooking by the early 2nd century), but its intense perfume was used, penetrating clothes to repel noxious insects (compare Citronella)."
"In Hebrew, the citron is known as the etrog (). It is one of the Four Species used during the holiday of Sukkot each fall. The role of the citron in that holiday was portrayed in the Israeli movie Ushpizin. Citrons that have been bred with lemon (in order to increase output per tree and make the tree less fragile) are not kosher for use as part of the Four Species."
Symptoms.
"Dehydrated people may have different symptoms depending on how dehydrated they are. If dehydration is not treated, it will get worse. As dehydration gets worse, the symptoms get more dangerous."
"When people start to get dehydrated, they may have these symptoms:"
"When dehydration gets severe (very bad), its symptoms include:"
"Severe dehydration is a medical emergency. If a person with severe dehydration does not get medical treatment soon enough, they can die."
What problems may dehydration cause?
Bad dehydration can cause serious health problems. Some of these problems are:
How is dehydration treated?
"To fix dehydration, a person has to replace the fluids and electrolytes that they have lost."
"When dehydration is not too bad, people can usually treat themselves by drinking. This is called oral rehydration therapy. Stores sell special drinks like Pedialyte and Gatorade, which have both water and electrolytes in them. People can also make their own oral rehydration solution (a drink which treats dehydration) by mixing water with sugar and salt."
People with very bad dehydration need emergency medical treatment. They may need to get fluids intravenously (through a needle placed into a vein). This replaces lost fluids and electrolytes much more quickly than drinking. It is also helpful for people who are unable to drink because of nausea and vomiting from dehydration.
Square Enix
"Square Enix is a Japanese company that makes video games and manga. It was created on April 1, 2003. Two companies called Square Co., Ltd. and Enix combined to form Square Enix."
"Square Enix is famous for its role-playing games. This includes the ""Final Fantasy series"", the ""Dragon Quest series"" and the ""Kingdom Hearts series"".They are one of the biggest videogame companies in the world."
Game designer
"A game designer is someone who designs games. The term ""game designer"" usually refers to someone who designs computer or video games, but can also be a person who designs older games like a board game."
Shigeru Miyamoto
"is a Japanese game designer and producer at Nintendo. He created the ""Donkey Kong"", ""Mario"", ""Pikmin"" and ""The Legend of Zelda"" video game series for Nintendo."
He is one of the most famous game designers in the world and is often called the father of modern video gaming. His games give players many ways to play and explore. This was unique in video games when his games were first released.
"Miyamoto started working with Nintendo in 1977 as an artist when it was still a toy and playing-card company. In 1980, he designed ""Donkey Kong"", which was a big success. Miyamoto became Nintendo's leading producer, and he continues to create many popular games for Nintendo today Such as entries in the Super Mario and the Zelda series."
Early Life.
"Miyamoto was born on November 16, 1952 in the Japanese town of Sonobe, which is a rural town that is northwest of Kyoto. His father taught English language."
"Miyamoto graduated from Kanazawa Municipal College of Industrial Arts with a degree in industrial design. However, he could not find a job. He also loved manga. Before he thought about starting a career in video games, he wanted to become a professional manga artist. Manga's classical kishōtenketsu narrative structure influenced him. Western genre television shows also influenced him. The game that made him want to enter the video game industry was the 1978 arcade game ""Space Invaders""."
Career.
"1977–1984: Arcade beginnings and ""Donkey Kong""."
"Nintendo was a small Japanese company in the late 1970s. They had traditionally sold playing cards and other novelties. However, they started making toys and games in the mid-1960s. Through a mutual friend, Miyamoto's father set up an interview with Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi. After showing some of his toy creations, Miyamoto was hired in 1977 as an apprentice in the planning department."
"Miyamoto became Nintendo's first artist. He helped create the art for Nintendo's first original coin-operated arcade video game, ""Sheriff"". He first helped the company develop a game with the 1980 release ""Radar Scope"". The game had some success in Japan. However, by 1981, Nintendo's efforts to sell it in the North American video game market failed. This left the company with a lot of arcade machines that were not sold. Nintendo was also facing financial ruin. In order to try to keep Nintendo going, Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi decided to change unsold ""Radar Scope"" machines into a new arcade game. He asked Miyamoto to do this. Miyamoto said self-deprecatingly that ""no one else was available"" to do the work. Nintendo's head engineer, Gunpei Yokoi, oversaw the project."
"Miyamoto thought of many characters and story ideas, but eventually decided on a love triangle between a gorilla, a carpenter, and a girl. He wanted to create something like what was with comic characters Bluto and Popeye for the woman Olive Oyl. Although, Nintendo tried to get the rights to ""Popeye"", but they failed. Bluto became an ape, a form Miyamoto said was ""nothing too evil or disgusting"". This ape would be the pet of the main character, ""a funny, hang-loose kind of guy."" Miyamoto also said ""Beauty and the Beast"" and the 1933 film ""King Kong"" influenced him. ""Donkey Kong"" was the first time that the creation of a video game's story came before the actual programming. Usually, the story was added without much care. Miyamoto had high hopes for his new project. However, he did not actually know how to program it himself; instead, he thought of the game's concepts, then asked technicians on whether they were possible. He wanted to make the characters different sizes, move in different ways, and react in various ways. However, Yokoi thought Miyamoto's original design was too difficult. Yokoi suggested using see-saws to catapult the character across the screen; however, this was also too difficult to do. Miyamoto next thought of using sloped platforms and ladders to move the character. He thought of using barrels for obstacles. When he asked that the game have multiple stages, the four-man programming team complained that he was basically asking them to make the game repeat, but the team eventually programmed the game. When the game was sent to Nintendo of America for testing, the sales manager did not like how it was different from the maze and shooter games common at the time. When American staffers started naming the characters, they decided on ""Pauline"" for the woman. She was named after Polly James, wife of Nintendo's Redmond, Washington, warehouse manager, Don James. The playable character was first called ""Jumpman"". They changed the name to Mario. He was named after Mario Segale, the warehouse landlord. These character names were written on the American cabinet art and used in advertising. The staff also got an English name for the game. The title was ""Donkey Kong""."
"""Donkey Kong"" was successful. Miyamoto started to work on sequels ""Donkey Kong Jr."" in 1982 and ""Donkey Kong 3"" in 1983. In the next game, he changed the ""Donkey Kong"" character Jumpman into Mario. He gave him a brother: Luigi. He named the new game ""Mario Bros."" Yokoi convinced Miyamoto to give Mario some special powers, namely being able to fall from any height without getting hurt. Mario's look in ""Donkey Kong""—overalls, a hat, and a thick mustache—led Miyamoto to change parts of the game. He changed it to make Mario look like a plumber instead of a carpenter. Miyamoto thought that New York City would be the best setting for the game. He thought it was the best place because it has a ""maze of subterranean sewage pipes"". The two-player mode and other parts of gameplay were influenced by an earlier video game called ""Joust"". To date, games in the ""Mario Bros."" series have been released for many consoles. Shortly after, Miyamoto also drew the character sprites and game design for the ""Baseball"", ""Tennis"", and ""Golf"" games on the NES."
Fluid ounce
"A fluid ounce is a unit of volume in both the imperial system of units and the U.S. customary units system. However, the two measures are not quite the same:"
Shape of the universe
"The shape of the Universe cannot be discussed with everyday terms, because all the terms need to be those of Einsteinian relativity. The geometry of the universe is therefore not the ordinary Euclidean geometry of our everyday lives."
"According to the special theory of relativity, it is impossible to say whether two distinct events occur at the same time if those events are separated in space. To speak of ""the shape of the universe (at a point in time)"" is naive from the point of view of special relativity. Due to the relativity of simultaneity we cannot speak of different points in space as being ""at the same point in time"" nor, therefore, of ""the shape of the universe at a point in time""."
"What astrophysicists do is ask whether a particular model of the universe is consistent with what is known through observations and measurements of the universe. If the observable universe is smaller than the entire universe (in some models it is many orders of magnitude smaller or even infinitesimal), observation is limited to a part of the whole."
Consideration of the shape of the universe can be split into two:&lt;br&gt;
"The observable universe is the basis for testing any model of the universe. It is a spherical volume (a ball) centered on the observer, regardless of the shape of the universe as a whole. Every location in the universe has its own observable universe, which may or may not overlap with the one centered on Earth."
"Recent measurements have led NASA to state, ""We now know that the universe is flat with only a 0.4% margin of error"". Within one model, the FLRW model, the present most popular shape of the Universe found to fit observational data is the infinite flat model. There are other models that also fit the data."
Meteor shower
"A meteor shower is an event when many meteors seem to come from one point in the night sky. These meteors are caused by meteoroids entering Earth's atmosphere at extremely high speeds on parallel paths. Most meteors are smaller than a grain of sand, so almost all of them burn up and never hit the Earth's surface."
"A meteor shower is the result of an interaction between a planet, such as Earth, and streams of debris from a comet. Comets are dirty snowballs, made up of rock embedded in ice, orbiting the Sun. Each time a comet swings by the Sun in its orbit, some of its ice vaporizes and meteoroids will be shed. The meteoroids spread out along the entire orbit of the comet to form a meteoroid stream, also known as a ""dust trail""."
"Most of our short-period meteor showers are the product of rare disintegrations, when large chunks break off a mostly dormant comet. Examples are the Quadrantids and Geminids. They originated from a breakup of asteroid-like objects, 2003 EH1 and 3200 Phaethon, respectively, about 500 and 1000 years ago. The fragments tend to fall apart quickly into dust, sand, and pebbles, and spread out along the orbit of the comet to form a dense meteoroid stream, which later moves into Earth's path."
"The most visible meteor shower in most years are the Perseids, which peak on 12 August each year at over one meteor per minute. NASA has a useful tool to calculate how many meteors per hour are visible from your observing location."
"The Leonid meteor shower peaks around 17 November of each year. About every 33 years, the Leonid shower produces a big meteor storm, peaking at thousands of meteors per hour. Leonid storms gave birth to the term ""meteor shower"" when it was first realised, during the November 1833 storm, that the meteors radiated from near the star Gamma Leonis. The last Leonid storms were in 1999, 2001 (two), and 2002 (two). Before that, there were storms in 1767, 1799, 1833, 1866, 1867, and 1966. When the Leonid shower is not ""storming"" it is less active than the Perseids."
Cat
"Cats, also called domestic cats (""Felis catus""), are small, carnivorous mammals, of the family Felidae."
"Domestic cats are often called 'house cats' when kept as indoor pets. Cats have been domesticated (tamed) for nearly 10,000 years."
They are one of the most popular pets in the world. They are kept by humans for hunting rodents and as friends.
"There are also farm cats, which are kept on farms to keep rodents away; and feral cats, which are domestic cats that live away from humans."
"A cat is sometimes called a ""kitty"". A young cat is called a ""kitten"". A female cat that has not had its sex organs removed is called a ""queen"". A male cat that has not had its sex organs removed is called a ""tom""."
"There are about 92 breeds of cat. Domestic cats are found in shorthair, longhair, and hairless breeds. Cats which are not specific breeds can be referred to as 'domestic shorthair' (DSH) or 'domestic longhair' (DLH)."
"The word 'cat' is also used for other felines. Felines are usually called either big cats or small cats. The big, wild cats are well known: lions, tigers, leopards, jaguars, pumas, and cheetahs. There are small wild cats in most parts of the world, such as the lynx in northern Europe. The big cats and wild cats are not tame, and can be very dangerous."
History.
"In the past, mostly in Egypt, people kept domestic cats because they hunted and ate mice and rats. Today, people often keep cats as pets. There are also domestic cats which live without being cared for by people. These kinds of cats are called ""feral cats"" or ""stray cats""."
"The oldest evidence of cats kept as pets is from the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, around 7500 BC. Ancient Egyptians worshipped cats as gods, and often mummified them so they could be with their owners ""for all of eternity""."
"Today, special food for cats is widely available in the developed countries. Proper feeding will help a cat live longer compared to hunting or being fed table scraps. Not correctly feeding a cat can lead to problems (see below for health concerns)."
Cats cannot taste sweet foods (with sugar) because of a mutation (change) in their ancestors which removed the ability to taste sweet things.
Cat anatomy.
"The System/370 or S/370 was a mainframe architecture, IBM built in the 1970s. The System was mostly compatible with System/360, which IBM had built before. &gt;Many applications coulds be re-used. The biggest change was that S/370 could handle virtual memory. The S/370 used tape drives and hard drives as mass storage device. The System/390 replaced the System/370 in the 1990s."
Jekyll (TV series)
Jekyll is a British television drama serial shown on BBC One. Steven Moffat wrote all six episodes. Douglas Mackinnon and Matt Lipsey directed three episodes each.
It was made by Hartswood Films and Stagescreen Productions. The series also got funding from BBC America.
"The series is a sequel to the novella ""Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde"", and not an adaptation of it. The Robert Louis Stevenson tale is used as a backstory within the series."
"It stars James Nesbitt as Tom Jackman, a modern-day descendant of Dr. Jekyll. He has recently begun transforming into a version of Mr. Hyde (also played by Nesbitt). Jackman is aided by psychiatric nurse Katherine Reimer, played by Michelle Ryan. Gina Bellman appears as Claire, Tom's wife."
Filming took place around southern England in late 2006. The series was first shown on BBC One in June and July 2007.
Plot.
"Doctor Tom Jackman (James Nesbitt) is a married father of two. He has abandoned his family without explanation to live in a heavily fortified basement flat. He hires psychiatric nurse Katherine Reimer (Michelle Ryan) to help him. After explaining a set of elaborate security procedures to Katherine, he straps himself into a metal chair and undergoes a transformation."
"Katherine observes that Tom's alter ego exhibits rage, heightened senses, strength and speed, and a flirtatious manner. She assures this persona she will keep his secrets just as she keeps Tom's. She asks for guarantees he will not harm her. Tom's alter ego takes Hyde's name. The two agree an uneasy truce. They share a body, but neither remembers what the other did while in charge. They use a micro cassette recorder to leave messages for each other."
"When Tom began transforming into the violent Hyde, he feared for his family's safety. He chose to isolate himself from them. He visits his wife Claire (Gina Bellman). During the visit, Hyde assumes control and learns about Tom's family."
"Miranda Callendar, played by Meera Syal, is a detective employed by Claire. She tells Tom that ""Jekyll and Hyde"" was not fiction, but a version of actual events. Miranda shows Tom a picture of the real Doctor Jekyll who lived in Edinburgh in the 19th century. Tom is startled to see that Jekyll looks exactly like him."
"Tom is also being watched by a private security team led by an American named Benjamin, played by Paterson Joseph. The team works for his former employers at the biotechnology firm, Klein and Utterson. The team is directed by his friend Peter Syme, played by Denis Lawson."
"When Benjamin puts Tom's children at risk, Hyde asserts himself, and kills a lion. At the hospital he is approached by Sophia, an elderly woman who claims to be his mother, but before he can question her she disappears."
"Tom confronts Peter, who attempts to drug him. This provokes Hyde to appear and take Peter and Claire hostage. Claire argues that they need to find a cure for Tom's condition. Hyde kills Benjamin. Peter says that Klein and Utterson have had a cure for a long time. Tom is captured and locked inside a metal coffin."
"Katherine and Miranda confront Peter, claiming they know the truth about Tom. Miranda thinks that Klein and Utterson have access to cloning technology and that Tom is Jekyll's clone. Peter denies this and orders them taken away to be killed."
"Peter reveals to Claire that Tom's treatment will make him into one persona. If it is Hyde, he will be kept for research. They will make the potion that turned the original Jekyll into Hyde. If it is Tom, she will be free to take him home. When the box is opened, Hyde is dominant."
"In a flashback triggered by genetic memory, Hyde has a vision of a meeting between Jekyll and Robert Louis Stevenson, the author of ""Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde"". Stevenson agrees to write a fictional version of Jekyll's case but reveals that he knows the truth: there is no potion. Instead, Jekyll was transformed into Hyde by his love for Alice, a maid within his household. Flashbacks into Tom's own life show his Hyde first appeared during a seaside holiday with Claire, after the pair were accosted by hooligans."
"Enraged by further threats to Tom's family, Hyde escapes from Klein and Utterson. Ms. Utterson, a ruthless redheaded American woman at the head of Klein and Utterson, takes Claire and her sons hostage at a private estate. She locks the twins in miniature versions of the coffin used on their father."
"Tom's alleged mother, Sophia, appears on the premises and helps Claire escape her locked bedroom. She tells Claire how Klein and Utterson had tried to clone Doctor Jekyll but had been unsuccessful. Claire meets several of the failed attempts in the basement of the building. They are disfigured and in a near-vegetative state. Sophia explains that Tom is a descendant of Doctor Jekyll, through Mr Hyde, and by chance ""a perfect throwback, a chance in a million"". Klein and Utterson had discovered this and had watched him from when he was six-months-old. In order to trigger his transformation into Hyde, they created a clone of Alice, the maid whom Jekyll had loved. This clone is Claire herself."
"Hyde tries to rescue Tom's family from Klein and Utterson. He kills Peter. There is a stand-off, with Tom and Claire's sons held hostage and suffocating. The Hyde personality is apparently killed when he is shot with multiple bullets and then manages to avoid 'sharing the damage' by taking the wounds onto himself while allowing Tom to assume his undamaged, healthy form, leaving Doctor Jackman as the only personality."
"Six months later, Tom has tracked down Sophia, the woman who claimed to be his mother. When he questions her about his father, she reveals that she is the descendant of Hyde. He had inherited the family curse from her. As Tom watches horrified, the powerless, tired, grey-haired Sophia transforms into her own version of the Hyde persona, the red-headed Ms Utterson."
Production.
Development.
"Jeffrey Tayor of Stagescreen Productions had the idea of a modern version of ""Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde"" in the mid-1990s. He attempted to get it produced in the United States, but all three attempts fell through. He returned to England and joined with Hartswood Films when Elaine Cameron was looking for ideas for a supernatural thriller. Cameron approached Steven Moffat for a script. A six-part series was commissioned by the BBC's Jane Tranter and John Yorke in November 2005."
"BBC America gave co-production funding in March 2006. The producers regularly met with Moffat for brainstorming sessions. The producers invited Moffat to ""write anything"", with the intention of cutting the material back later. However, they were reluctant to cut material once they saw it on the page. The first episode starts with Jackman already knowing about his alter ego. Because the plot of ""Jekyll"" begins after the story has developed for the characters, Nesbitt says that the show feels like it is a second series."
"Moffat explicitly describes the series as a sequel, rather than an adaptation. He said the Jekyll of the original story really existed, and Jackman is his ""modern-day descendant dealing with the same problems"". As ""Jekyll and Hyde"" is such a well-known phrase, Moffat labored over what to call the series, eventually deciding upon ""Jekyll"" because that word ""carries the name Hyde"". The final episode replaces the title ""Jekyll"" with ""Hyde"". Producer Elaine Cameron says the one word title gives the series a ""very modern feel"". Moffat initially named the character Jekyll rather than Jackman, but found it cumbersome to constantly explain that the book had not been written in this alternate universe. Instead he chose a version where the book exists, but changed the name to Jackman. Otherwise, Cameron felt, the character would appear stupid by not realising what was happening when turning into Hyde."
"The scene between Tom and Katherine was expanded slightly in the sixth episode to keep their relationship active to facilitate a second series. However, no further episodes were commissioned. In an August 2007 interview, Moffat told Alan Sepinwall of ""The Star-Ledger"" that he had a sequel written for the miniseries ""should the BBC be interested""."
"Following ""Jekyll,"" Moffat became a co-writer on ""Sherlock."""
Casting.
"James Nesbitt and his agent attended a meeting with Jane Tranter in late 2005 regarding the 2006 series of ""Murphy's Law"". At the conclusion of the meeting, she offered him a script for ""Jekyll"", suggesting that he might like the role. Nesbitt took the script role as a way of putting a distance between his previous work. The casting of Nesbitt as Tom Jackman and Hyde was publicised on 12 December 2005, but filming was not scheduled to begin until September 2006, increasing Nesbitt's anticipation to play the roles. Writer Steven Moffat said that the dual-role required a very skilled actor, and a well-known actor was necessary because it was such an expensive show to produce. The production team decided Nesbitt's two characters would be mainly differentiated over a change in performance rather than by extensive make-up because they wanted Hyde to be able to walk around in public without attracting attention."
Once every five years?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Uh, you have got a pretty big family."
Yeah
and that is the hardest part about getting the the stuff together
and everyone is spread out all over Timbuktu.
"Oh, yeah."
And you?
"Yeah,"
"we have a pretty big family,"
"but most of us,"
"well, uh, uh, I am originally from West Virginia."
Uh-huh.
"Most of the family is right in the West Virginia, uh, uh, what they call Tri-State area, uh, northern West Virginia, eastern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania."
Yeah.
Most everybody is right in that area.
That makes it a lot easier.
A lot more convenient.
That is why we only do it once every five or ten years.
Yeah.
because it is always that hard to get everyone together.
Yeah.
They put one together for our family about once every June.
"It was on my grandmother's birthday,"
"but she is, she is gone now."
"Yeah,"
see that is kind of what happened with ours.
That is why we have not had one in a long time.
Yeah.
Uh.
"So, so, to make one successful, I mean, I mean what do you all do."
"You know, not so much at what the schools are teaching, but what they let the kids get away with."
"Um, uh-huh."
"You know, they, they see most, uh,"
"they're, they're quite upset about the, uh, the disruptive influence of school."
"Most of them would say, you know, those people should be removed from the school system."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"And in Japan they would be, you know."
Right.
"But, uh, here again, you get back into a political thing, where, uh,"
Yeah
"there's, there's,"
right.
"There's definitely too much leeway as far as,"
Uh-huh.
"I mean, I've only been out of, I've been out of college only two years,"
Uh-huh.
and you were saying that you don't appreciate education until you get out
"and I, I already, you know, I really didn't, I really don't see myself going back to school or anything,"
"but, I appreciate more what I had."
Uh-huh.
"And I had all these classes and all this knowledge and this big library across the street from my dorm,"
"Yeah,"
were you at Baylor?
and I just didn't take as much advantage of it as I should have.
"Yeah,"
did you go to Baylor?
"No,"
"I went to U T at Austin,"
uh-huh.
"Oh, oh, okay."
"I'm, uh,"
exactly.
they have to just go through everything.
Exactly.
"And you'll find that probably by the time your twenty-eight, thirty, if you haven't slowed down,  something will slow you down."
Uh-huh.
Do you know what I'm saying?
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"Um, because it's just, you find out that you're really not, um, smelling the roses,"
"and I know that sounds trite,  and all that."
"Yeah,"
"I think, I think a lot of, uh, people probably feeling that way,"
"I know, I'm probably feeling that way because it's, everything's geared towards young.  You know"
Uh-huh.
"and whether I want to realize it or not, everything on television is young,  young, young, young."
Oh it is.
"You can't be a model after thirty,"
"you can't do this after twenty, you know"
"and,  everybody that's in the music business is starting out at fifteen.  You know,"
That's right.
Uh-huh.
and so I feel like I'm old.
"It's like I sing,  I sing"
"and I would really love to become,  uh, a professional singer,"
Uh-huh.
"but I think I'm too old now,"
"Oh, you're not,"
no.
"and I'm twenty-three,"
No.
"because everyone I've seen coming up, they're fifteen.  You know,"
That's true
Yeah.
All right.
Happy home repairing.
Okay.
You too
Bye-Bye.
Bye-Bye.
"Hi,"
what do you do with your credit cards?
Oh
"Well, my husband and I have gotten into some, some problems with credit cards."
We don't handle them very well
"We, we tend to run them up to the maximum and then ask for more."
"Oh, jeez."
"They, they're, they're really bad for us."
"Um, matter of fact, we've gotten rid of all of our credit cards except for a MasterCard and a Visa,"
and we pretty much keep those maxed out.
"Oh, I was going to say that, that sounds like, like pretty many."
"But I see what you meant,"
you had them for each of the individual stores.
"Yeah,"
"we had I had probably twenty credit cards for,"
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"I had, I had an American Express, American Express Gold, an Optima, all the different department stores, um, two Visas, two MasterCards"
"Oh, gee."
"I mean, I had,"
"any time anybody would, you know, send me an application, you know, preapproved or whatever, I went, I took it,"
and it really ended up getting us in some real serious trouble.
"Oh, sure."
"Um, because, see, the more credit cards you have, the more people offer them to you."
"Uh-huh,"
"and if they get too close to that perimeter, it it zaps them."
Oh.
Boy.
Yeah
I'd be afraid to walk around if I was that dog
"Yeah,"
"well, a friend of mine at work here said that he tried it with his dog"
and he wanted to see what he was subjecting his dog to
so he held on to the collar
and he walked out to the perimeter.
He said it was a good jolt.
"Oh, really?"
"Yeah,"
"and so, I, I don't take too well to, to those sorts of training techniques."
Um.
I don't think they're always necessary.
"If you put enough patience into,"
"Yeah,"
just be consistent and diligent with it
Uh-huh.
"and, um,"
"It's, uh, is your cat an indoor cat or an outdoor cat?"
Yeah
"he's indoor and all declawed because I know the, uh, average life span of an outdoor cat is eighteen months."
Somebody just told me that
Yeah.
because of the leukemia?
"Yeah,"
"that and also just, uh, getting hit, I guess, or getting beat up."
And the average life span of an indoor cat is eighteen years
Wow.
"So,"
"and, uh, course this,"
"grant it,"
"that's, you know, it's been four years ago,"
"but it's remarkable that the, that the bigger vans, uh, they're, uh,"
"my boss just bought a, a pick up truck,"
"and, uh, he only gets seventeen miles a gallon."
Yeah.
"But it, it has a big engine,"
"and it, it, pulls a boat and stuff,"
"but it's, and it, it's got the seats"
"that, and the other thing that is interesting, is it has, uh, rear air conditioning."
Uh-huh.
"And that, that makes a lot of difference in those of us that live in warm climates."
Yeah.
"Well, now, this one that we went in,"
it did
to baby what kind of van was that that we went to Florida in?
Ford.
A what?
Ford.
A Ford?
"Ford what,"
you remember?
"conversation with He was trying to think of what the name of it was,"
"Well, the big, you know, the big vans are all, real nice,"
this was a big one.
"I mean it was a big one,"
"yeah,"
oh those are
"it has the front and the back and you know, it has the uh, back seat let down into a double, I mean a queen size bed"
yeah.
Yeah.
"I really haven't,"
"no,"
huh-uh
I did  test drive a Corvette last year. Maybe the year before.
"It was brand new, white,"
it was like a big marshmallow.
"When you sat in the seats, they adjusted to fit around you."
uh.
I mean they came in and up and out
"and I mean, they did whatever"
"and, and we went for a test drive in that"
and I was able to open that up pretty good
and that was really fun.
"And I wanted it,"
but I had a choice of that or my house
"and I thought that I'd continue,  to live in my house"
so.
"Yeah,"
"there, there's something about having a place to live,"
I don't know.
"Yeah,"
"you know, it's just necessary."
"And I did, I thought well a tent wouldn't be bad but probably not practical."
Could sleep in the back of the 'vette.
"Yeah,"
right
"So,"
"I find that, uh, that the Corvettes are, are becoming really, really nice cars."
"They are, they're pretty aren't they lately"
Yeah.
"And  they, they've improved, the performance and the suspension such that they're actually a lot of fun to drive."
They really are.
Yeah.
"I, uh, spent this past summer up in Canada."
"Uh, well part of it, touring."
"And, uh, you know, I was amazed cause I'd pick up a local paper and I'd read about all of these, you know, really interesting things going on."
"There's some serious talk about whether there's actually going to be a, a Canada, you know, in the next five years. You know, because of the problems with Quebec"
Yeah.
and I had never heard any of that before.
"Yeah,"
"you know, there was, a, a,"
"what is it called,"
is it Meech Lake Accord?
Uh-huh.
"Or, or, that's just something, uh, I'd say ninety percent of the people here would never have heard of"
"and I think that I heard of it about the first time when I was up in Calgary a couple of years ago and, you know, picked up a, a paper and started reading a little bit more detail about it."
"And, and came"
it was a big thing going on there
and I came back here
and nothing in the papers.
"Right,"
right.
I didn't see a thing about it.
"So it's, uh, we've got a long ways to go, I guess."
It's improved.
"And like I say, with C N N and, and, uh, the cable news."
"Even, even there's, uh, uh,"
it's it's semireligious in some respects.
But what is it?
"It's, uh, I mean it's news is not, not that way,"
"uh, oh, I'm trying to think of the channel."
"The, the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR."
"Oh, yeah."
"Uh, I, it surprised me."
"I would, that's ideally the where, where I would like to be."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"and like I said, once, once it, it happened I couldn't because my son's tuition came due,"
"and I guess I had, you know, not really counted on it quite at that point"
Uh-huh.
"but, um, yeah,"
I didn't like it at all.
I was very uncomfortable.
"So,"
I can imagine.
"You know, and, and I mean, it was, I thought a lot,"
"sixty dollars interest or something for, for just a couple of months,"
"and I'm going jeez, that's outrageous,"
Yeah.
"but in, in, you know, retrospect it wasn't all that much,"
I mean a lot of people pay a lot more
"and and, you know, but still, I mean, I figured I didn't need those items if it cost me sixty dollars more to have them."
"Oh, yeah."
Uh-huh.
Think about what you can buy for sixty dollars.
Exactly
Groceries for a week.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
Yeah.
"I, I think about all, all the money that, that we've spent on interest on all of our credit cards,"
Uh-huh.
and it's just incredible.
But now did you use to not feel so badly because you could take it off your income tax?
We've never been able to take it off our income tax.
I mean they were so rude about it.
Right.
And so we wanted a different kind of catch
and she said well it's not guaranteed.
"And I said, well put it on because apparently nothing's guaranteed"
so do it anyway.
Uh-huh.
So we got the kind we wanted
and I was really disappointed with that.
I felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable
Uh-huh.
and I happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends
and I called there to see if they had it
and the lady was very nice.
"And I said my goodness,"
"I said you've been very nice, what's your name."
And she told me
and I said well I really appreciate it.
"I said there seems to be a big attitude problem in that, store"
and it turned out she was the assistant manager
"so,"
Right.
"So I felt kind of good about that, you know."
I didn't  even know the person's name that had given me the hard time or anything
Uh-huh.
Right.
"but I just felt like, well at least I did something."
Maybe they'll fix it.
"They might work on that, you know."
"Right,"
right.
But I find attitudes are more of a problem.
Yeah.
Or so it seems.
"I may just be paranoid,"
but that state income tax is just eating me alive.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
they have a state income tax in Maryland.
"But I noticed when I was in the, in the, in Texas, they didn't have a state income tax,"
"but they sure nailed you on those darn county taxes and, school taxes and property taxes,"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Property taxes and,"
"Oh my God,"
ate you alive.
"Yeah,"
"well, Colorado, you know they have the state income tax,"
"but then they also have property taxes,"
"and they also have sales taxes,"
and they just get you every direction they can.
Yeah.
"And I just don't know, sir,"
but it seems like they trying to get you every which way.
"Yeah,"
"it sure does. Um,"
"there's, uh, some good books that I've read, um, that you might be interested in. Uh"
Oh yeah?
Charles D. Gibbons is the guy who runs some ads on light night T V
"and he's got seminars you can go to,"
"and they try to hook you into his organization, which costs about four hundred bucks."
But he's got a couple of books out.
"One of them is called, uh, WEALTH WITHOUT RISK."
I've heard of the book.
Oh
and so then she crawls on the carpet
"and, oh, the smell I mean it's just really awful"
Uh-huh.
"and that's, that's one real drawback,"
but you know I guess you'll do just about anything for your pet if you love them enough
"Yes,"
you will.
You will.
"You know, we were trying to decide to, you know, about putting him to sleep."
"He was just, you know, he was getting so old and had a, other problems too."
"And, and fortunately the decision was just taken away from us which made it a whole lot easier. You know,"
"and, and again going through that because our, our animals are almost like our kids in some ways, you know,"
"and, and you grieve just as much over them when they go you know, as you would a child."
Uh-huh.
"And, and, you know, our son and, and his wife and our daughter and her husband and the grandkids all say, get a dog, get a dog, you know."
Little thing.
"Be quiet,"
be quiet.
"And I can tell my husband, you know, deep down he, you know, he"
"Brian in Plano, Texas. How are you doing today?"
"Hi,"
"fine,"
I'm Nancy.
How are you?
"Great, Nancy."
I'm in Plano also
"You're in Plano also, huh?"
"Yes,"
we're not too long distance today.
"Well, good to hear."
I was just talking to someone the other day from Pennsylvania.
"I have a farm a hundred miles east of here in East Texas,"
"and you know, all these huge trees just like the eastern hard wood belt all the way up to Maine, you know,"
"it's that same trees, pines and, and hard woods, you know hickories and oaks and stuff,"
Yeah.
"and, uh, I was up there last weekend,"
"and there are trees that, that still have their leaves on,"
"and they're green,"
but they're dead
"You know, the, the freeze just got them."
"They, they weren't ready for it at all apparently,"
"and, and we haven't had a typical fall at all."
"Not much color, you know, changes have occurred at all."
Really weird this year.
"I'm not sure what that, what that means."
I don't know.
"Yeah,"
"our leaves are, are all on, on the ground now."
I think it was an especially good winter for fall colors.
"So you, you all actually had some color, huh?"
"Oh, yeah,"
yeah.
It kind of crept in
"and,"
"Yeah,"
"we, we did, for a time."
"Yeah,"
it's usually beautiful up there isn't it?
Uh-huh.
Gorgeous.
"That's, you know,"
"I think you could drive along in Maryland and look at the sweet gum trees on each side and the, and the pines and what not,"
"and you could, you know, you could be driving along in East Texas and looks just the same."
Yes.
"Yes,"
yes.
"So,"
Which I think is a good thing.
It just breaks my heart to see these poor little old dogs wandering the streets looking starved
"and, you know."
Uh-huh.
"It, uh,"
"plus, uh, you know the safety factor and stuff."
"Well, we enjoy having pets."
"We, uh, you know, I think they're a lot of company,"
"and, and when my mother lived with us, uh, the cat was really hers"
"and, and he was kind of wild."
"Our, our daughter found her and brought her to us,"
"and, uh, that cat walked in and walked right up to my mother and jumped up and curled up in her lap."
Oh.
"And she was the only one at first that, you know, could really hold him, you know, because he was really skittish."
"But it was like he knew you know,"
uh-huh.
"and he would sleep with her,"
"and so he was a lot of company to her. You know, and, and just love her."
Yeah.
"And he's, cats are usually so independent"
"but this one you know, he comes up"
"and he crawls up next to my husband now, you know."
"He's,"
"you know, before the dog died, we have a queen size bed and the dog would sleep on my side,"
"and the cat would sleep on my husband's side, you know"
And when everybody turned we all four of us turned in a row
My husband that's one thing he hated was our cat used to sleep with us.
Uh-huh.
So he didn't go howl?
"No,"
"he wouldn't go howl,"
"so all the, all the people that worked with the father ostracized him"
"Oh, how funny."
It is.
"It, it, it's, it's real interesting to watch the show,"
"and, and the relationship between the family is, is really now, now the mother-in-law lives in the house with them."
Huh.
"So it's,"
"our, our grandson, our oldest grandson is the one that, that got us to watching it."
"But it really is, it moves real fast."
"It's a real short,"
"and there's always, like I say, a moral to it"
"and,"
"It's just a half hour,"
or is it hour?
"Well, half hour."
Oh.
"That, that's all there is to it."
"And, and, uh, they ..."
"There's not many half hour shows,"
"it seems like that,"
"Yeah,"
"it, it, they, they're trying to liken the, the father in there of the teenage son to like JACKIE GLEASON SHOW. Uh, the way he talks to his mother-in-law and so forth,"
Uh-huh.
"and I guess maybe there are some parts of that,"
but I didn't really see that in there.
"But what I've read about it, they talk about that."
"But anyway, we've, we've enjoyed that,"
"and, and, uh, I guess mostly I, I like the news shows too, the news magazines, like SIXTY MINUTES or TWENTY, TWENTY or PRIME TIME LIVE or something like that, you know, all, all of those shows, if I can do it,"
"Yeah,"
"if you're cutting,"
are you talking about cutting equipment or tools for for set up?
"Uh, tools for set up and for measurement."
"Uh, you got to have a one tenth indicator,"
"it's a hundred dollars. Uh,"
"five tenths uh, usually two one tenth indicators at a hundred dollars each. Uh,"
Huh.
five tenths indicator at about a hundred dollars.
"You got to have, uh, six inch set of calipers at anywhere from sixty to a hundred twenty dollars."
"You got to have a zero to one for sixty dollars. Uh,"
one to two inch micrometer for sixty dollars.
A two to three for eighty dollars.
A three to four for eighty dollars.
So you've got thousands of dollars or so.
I mean you get a thousand dollars worth of tools.
Real fast.
Yes.
"Real, real fast."
Edge finders and ...
"But I was thinking about though that, that when you actually get to the milling equipment though, when it starts turning ..."
"Well, I know,"
"because, okay."
Your end mills will be measured in inches or fractions of inches.
Yeah.
You know.
"But you, when you, when you simply drilling a hole, I mean, a real simple thing, like gee,"
I need a hole there.
What size hole?
Yeah.
"As in metric size hole or a, or an American sized hole?"
Yeah.
"And, and what, but the thing is then you've got to with screws"
"Uh, I have a son that is in the fourth grade"
Huh.
"and, uh, they have just now taken up division."
Wow.
Yeah
And
That is slow.
"uh,"
my husband and I go to the store
"and we buy these math books and fractions and multiplication, division things"
"and I feel like, uh, there are several areas that we're just really, really slow in."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, I don't blame the teachers as much as I blame the system."
"It is,"
What do you think's wrong to cause that?
"Well, well, for one thing there's not enough money in the school system."
"And the money they do have, they're not, they do not use it wisely."
Yeah.
"Uh, she, my son's teacher has twenty-seven students."
Uh-huh.
And that's certainly is a lot of students for one person to deal  with on an every day basis. Uh
Yeah.
Perhaps.
"but more than that, I don't think that they have the authority to command the attention of the children."
Yeah.
"And when you have two kids in that class that constantly keeps the class in an uproar and you're not at liberty to do something about it, other than give them on campus isolation or send them to the principal's office. It  it, you know, it can, it can really be bad."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"that's, that's one thing I worry about ."
"Uh, also I think, we have a lot of, uh, Hispanics"
"There you go,"
uh-huh.
"I said I don't know,"
I'll have to try it and see.
I've always watched it.
Uh-huh.
"And he said, well, fine,"
"he said, we'll just take you over to the course, he lives near Brookhaven we'll just take you over to the course and get you some lessons and let you see if you like it."
Uh-huh
"If you do, then we can go golf together."
Uh-huh.
"Oh, whoa,"
"great,"
I get to walk all around a little green field all day.
"But those kinds of things happen, though,"
"you, you get a little taste of it"
"and you say, Hey, this is not bad."
Uh-huh.
And you really begin to develop an interest in it.
But I am not an athlete at all.
Me either.
"You know, I'm always the one that got hit by the bat in baseball, and, hung my fingernails in the net in volleyball."
So I am not an athlete.
Maybe golf is a forgiving sport.
I don't know.
Yeah
"at least you're just you're competing against yourself, I guess, more than everybody else out there."
It doesn't appear to be
Uh-huh.
"I really, I, I haven't really acquired an interest in it,"
"but I'm open to try anything, you know."
Yeah
"that's, kind of the way I feel."
"The one thing that is also detrimental as far I'm concerned, my skin is very fair"
Yeah.
Yeah
"I know a lot of companies that waste so much that,"
"I'm even trying,"
you know that was one thing we noticed last week that we had some new people move into our building And they were just used one time and thrown in the dumpster
Yes.
"and I thought, I don't understand this, you know."
Yeah.
"We're trying to cut cost and everything like that, and, and recycle and all that stuff"
"and, and here we are wasting."
"And I don't understand, sometimes, the way, the thinking, the logic behind it."
"Well the last time, uh, someone moved offices in my building"
"and, uh, the, uh, properties people came in with all, with the good cardboard boxes."
"Not the cheap ones of course. And packed everything up and moved them and left them lying around,"
Uh-huh.
"I, I took several home because I'm moving pretty soon"
and they're good boxes.
That's exactly what I did.
And they were just going to throw them away.
"Exactly what I did, exactly."
Yeah.
Because I didn't want to waste that.
Huh-uh.
And it's hard enough to find good packing boxes .
Right
"and, and these boxes are,"
you can unfold them.
Right.
"So, you know, there, they don't take up much storage space."
"Exactly right,"
well that's very good
"Yeah,"
but  I think we're finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"God, it's amazing"
"And for our age group it's too late, too little, too late."
Right.
Right.
"But I, I do think it's an area that needs to be looked at and improved because more of us are going to have to work."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Two income families I think are here to stay.
"Well and I would think, you know, since big business is supposedly why the government makes the decisions they do you know, the, the people that work in big business have families"
Uh-huh.
Right.
they have children.
Yeah.
"So, it's only to their advantage that they get these programs going and  working"
Oh sure.
"and, uh,"
You retain employees and keep them longer.
"That's, that was the rationale they gave when they were giving us information about our Employee Assistance Programs that  they want us to be happy and want us to be able to cope with trying to split ourselves in fifteen million pieces"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Right.
Right.
Right.
"So, I, I hope it helps."
It seems to help the new mothers  not have to come back full-time.
Oh that's good.
because that's hard.
That's good to know.
"I have a couple of friends that, have, have found the, uh, you know, a a private home to take their children to when they're young until they hit the preschool age."
"and, uh, of course, the better you know a person that might be affiliated with that kind of thing, the more you can trust their, their judgment and their insight."
Right.
Right.
Uh-huh.
"But the media insight, as you said,"
I just kind of read and kind of be aware
Yeah.
"and then, uh, I don't like to make a whole lot of, uh, judgment myself unless things are so absolutely out of whack that, uh,"
Yeah.
Okay.
All right.
That's a real different topic.
"I'm not sure I'm familiar with, with what they mean of invasion of privacy."
I know.
"I guess that, I guess you consider just things that every day that would, you would think of about."
"See, I'm a college student,"
"so I can think of lots of things that my roommate does that bother me you know, that I think's like is an invasion of my privacy, stuff like that."
Yeah.
"But I think it'd be, it is kind of a tough topic."
Yeah.
"I think, personally, you know,"
"I'm, I used to be a college student ten years ago"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"but uh, now I think an invasion of my privacy is when someone calls me on the telephone and says, Mrs Miller, have we got a deal for you."
Uh-huh.
"Oh, golly."
"You're like, No, you don't, no."
"It's like, how do you know my name,"
"where did you get my phone number,"
and why do you think it's a deal for me?
Uh-huh.
"In a big city like that most houses, I would think, would be sort of like what we live in. Just a you know, basic tract house."
"Well, in the, uh, newer neighborhoods and development communities, the houses are so close together,"
Yeah.
if your neighbor is having an argument you can here it blow for blow.
That's exactly right.
That's the way we are.
"We have, uh, one thing we have that we really enjoy here, is we have a hot tub in the back."
"So we have, we have quite a few parties,"
"and uh, seems like everyone that lives around us, ends up, you know, hearing every conversation that goes on outside with everyone."
"So, uh, that's true"
"that is one thing that I don't enjoy about it, is the houses are too close together."
"But, uh, you know, it's fine for now,"
"hopefully, eventually, we'll move in a larger home."
The only thing that I don't like also is the rooms are so small.
"You know, it's very difficult to arrange furniture and things like that,"
so.
Are your rooms in your house bigger since it's a sixties home?
"Because it seems like then, that they built the homes much larger"
is that true?
Yeah.
And they've got better closet space.
Yeah.
new houses that I've seen.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's really it.
That's a plus.
At least we do have like three walk-in closets here.
"So that's, that's maybe not so typical,"
"but, uh,"
It helps a bunch.
Yeah.
"And people who do have them, curse."
Right.
"Another thing I have that, um, is weird is the, a locus tree in the back yard."
"As a matter of fact there's three of them, very badly trimmed,"
they aren't trimmed at all.
Uh-huh.
"And I can imagine if I had to mow the lawn in the back, which we said we'd do, if the trees hang down"
"so, and the locus trees have like three quarters of an inch thorns on it."
"Yeah,"
"they're like,"
"I think I've seen those before,"
but I don't remember what they look like.
"They're a pretty tree,"
"but you just, when you walk up to them they're covered with thorns."
"So we're going to get a chain saw and limb it extensively so it gets the trees up overhead,"
"So it'll give you room to get under it,"
"sure,"
"Yeah,"
"because I can just see brushing up against it, that it would rip your skin."
Yeah.
It's worse than a rose bush.
Um.
"Many times worse, because of course, it's a tree."
"Oh, a tree is always something very nice to have."
"Yeah,"
"my dad used to work on them,"
so I don't think I'll have a problem.
My husband will have problems borrowing one.
"then you got to get him to,"
"if he's going to do it, you've got to twist his arm to get him to go do it."
"Well, if that's not the problem ..."
"Okay,"
I think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers.
"Oh, that's right."
I work for a law firm
"I, I'm serious."
And I think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems that exist in the in the criminal system today. With plea bargaining.
Right.
"You know, if someone is"
Well plea plea bargaining is a different story.
Well.
Plea bargaining is something completely different.
"That, that actually prevents trials. Or at least speeds them up."
"Well, I know."
That's what I'm saying.
"But I think a lot of, all of the whole criminal system is messed up in, in that regard."
"I mean, you know, people who commit, uh, crimes that they,"
I don't know how it works exactly
"but  you know, they get lesser sentences"
Right.
"and I understand that the jails are full of people, you know, uh  and that they have to do something."
Right.
"But, I think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it."
Huh.
you know what I'm saying?
"That we don't have, uh, well a lot of states don't have capital punishment."
Right.
"And, uh I, I think they should."
We do
"I, and I think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say, it's, it's, there's no doubt whatsoever. Like drunk drivers that kill people"
"and, uh, you know, all"
Right.
"they, they're caught dead to rights."
"I, I just think that that's, they've, they've taken a life"

Their sizes vary from 4 MiB (32 Mibit, such as ""Automobili Lamborghini"" and ""Dr. Mario 64"") to 64 MiB (512 Mibit, such as ""Resident Evil 2"" and ""Conker's Bad Fur Day""). The Game Pak's design tradeoffs were intended to achieve maximal system speed and minimal system cost, with a lesser storage space and a higher unit cost per game."
"Launched in 1996, the Nintendo 64 was the last major home console to use a cartridge as its primary storage format until the release of the Nintendo Switch in 2017. Portable systems such as the PlayStation Vita, Nintendo DS, and Nintendo 3DS also use cartridges."
"Nintendo's data storage strategy with the Nintendo 64 had always been to develop a complementary higher-capacity peripheral to accompany the Nintendo 64 Game Pak. This strategy resulted in 1999's 64DD, an aftermarket peripheral which was launched years late and only in Japan as a commercial failure, leaving the Game Pak as the Nintendo 64's sole storage medium."
"To complement the company's two previous high-speed cartridge-based console generations, Nintendo had already developed high-capacity secondary storage devices such as the Famicom Disk System and the cancelled SNES-CD. The company had always intended to do likewise with this generation. In a 1994 interview, Nintendo summarized its analysis of the continued advantages of cartridges for its upcoming console, eventually known as the Nintendo 64."
Even the main dimensions of the two UIC standard wagons are identical with those of the open goods wagons (Fcs and Fals):
"The wagons are normally reserved for one type of commodity in order to avoid having to clean them after use, but also because certain goods require the loading space to be lined in order to avoid them sticking to the walls or, with chemicals, to protect the walls from corrosion. Many Td wagons are exclusively used for the transport of foodstuffs and therefore bear the index letter ""g""."
"In addition there are special types for specific purposes, for example those with low-level apertures for gravity discharging (Class ""T…oo…"")."
"The distinction with UIC Class U wagons is fluid. Especially when wagons do not conform to the UIC standard wagon or only have a roof hatch for loading instead of a movable roof, they count as special wagons. Many French grain wagons therefore have a 9 instead of a 0 in their wagon numbers."

The preface to the 1860 edition explains that the novel has been less popular than his other works of fiction due to the prejudice against literary works that are thought to owe their value, in part, to the illustrations."
"In ""Leila"", as the double title suggests, there is a double storyline: the domestic story of the daughter (Leila) and the public story of the nation. Leila's father, Almamen, switches allegiances between Christian and Moor in what eventually becomes the famous Siege of Granada. Almamen attempts to guard his daughter's Jewish heritage by keeping her away from her Moorish lover, Muza. He inadvertently delivers her into the hands of the Christian monarchs, and Leila is subjected to the procedures of conversion by the queen's intermediary, Donna Inez. In the double story line, the conquest of Muslim Granada runs parallel to the conversion of the Jewish Leila. The characters meet at the altar of a convent in which Leila is about to take her vows as a nun, and her father kills her. The domestic plot parallels the Christianization of Spain."

= = = Mustang Aeronautics Midget Mustang = = =
The Mustang Aeronautics Midget Mustang MM-1 is a single-seat aerobatic sports airplane developed and marketed in the United States for homebuilding. It is also known as the Long Midget. It was the predecessor to the Mustang II which is also known as the Bushby Mustang. Rights to both the Midget Mustang and the Mustang II were sold to Mustang Aeronautics in 1992.
"It is a low-wing cantilever monoplane of metal construction, primarily of 2024-T3 aluminum and most are fitted with fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Developed by Piper engineer David Long in 1948, plans for production by Schweizer were underway at the time of Long's death two years later. All rights and tooling were purchased by Robert Bushby in 1959, who built a 90 hp Continental powered example and sold plans and kits until 1992 when the rights were sold to Mustang Aeronautics. The Midget Mustang design being marketed in 2016 is similar to the original, with the option of building it with a bubble canopy in place of the straight line of the upper tailcone and hinged canopy of Long's original design, making it an M-IA."
Construction requires about 1000 hours of builder time.
"The Midget Mustang was intended for air racing. David Long designed an aircraft for a friend to be used in the Cleveland Air Race in 1948. That aircraft was built by Long and was named ""Pea Shooter"". The Midget Mustang was only moderately successful as a race plane. However, its appearance and desirable flight characteristics made it an ideal sport plane. At the Cleveland Race, racers competed in aircraft with names like, ""Mammy"",""Miss Fort Worth"", and ""Slo Poke"". Over time, air racers modified the aircraft to reach 181 mph (291 km/h) speeds in competition. Nowadays, the Midget Mustang can cruise at 240 mph."

He is considered a veteran Nasserist and a long-time advocate of pan-Arab unity. He has authored several books specializing in Egyptian and Arab politics. He is a resident of Shobra and a Coptic Christian."
"Iskander began his career in activism as a staunch Nasserist. Throughout the 1970s, during the presidency of Anwar Sadat, he was part of the anti-Sadat student movement and won in two student union elections. He also participated in the anti-austerity protests of 1977 which resulted in his arrest. He was arrested two more times, during the 1980 parliamentary elections and in 1983 for suspicions of being part of an clandestine Nasserist organization. He was severely tortured during his latter stint in prison."
"When the Arab Democratic Nasserist Party (ADNP) was legalized in 1992 Iskander joined the party, which was founded by Diaa al-Din Dawoud, but later left the party in 1998 along with other members of the ""new guard"" after disagreements with the party's leaders. Along with former ADNP cadre Hamdeen Sabahi, Iskander co-founded the Dignity Party (""Al-Karama""). He continued his activism, being instrumental in the establishment of the Egyptian-Palestinian solidarity movement in 2000 after the start of the Second Intifada (Palestinian uprising) against the Israeli occupation. He also helped organize protests against the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the ensuing occupation."
"These protests, together with wide disapproval of Hosni Mubarak's policies in Egypt, eventually culminated with the founding of Kefaya, a grassroots opposition movement. Iskander was one of the principal leaders of the movement and became a vocal opponent of the planned, succession of Gamal Mubarak, Hosni's son, to the presidency which Iskander criticized as ""presidential inheritance."""
"Iskander joined the youth-led protests of the 2011 Egyptian revolution on its first day, 25 January and was arrested by security forces while protesting in Cairo's Shobra district on the first day. He continued protesting after his release on 27 January. He became the Dignity Party's secretary-general in 2011. Iskander strongly condemned the killing of mostly Coptic Christians protesters during the Maspero demonstrations on 9 October.

Although the year-round population is only 22, during the summer season, the population swells to around 300, mostly tourists."

It was established in 2011 after being spun off from Hunter College's Teacher U program. It is the first stand-alone graduate school of education to open in New York since Bank Street College of Education was founded in 1916.
"The New York Board of Regents approved the school unanimously with one abstention. Alternative certification programs such as Teach for America and the New York City Teaching Fellows utilize existing colleges for required coursework, while Relay GSE provides its own course program. Teacher U CEO Norman Atkins was chosen as the graduate school's president."
"Teacher U was founded by three charter school networks ""with impressive student achievement records"": KIPP, Achievement First, and Uncommon Schools. The school will serve charter school and district teachers. There was opposition to the school's establishment from some of New York's existing universities that offer teacher education programs."
"On September 7, 2013, Relay GSE held the commencement ceremony for its first graduating class of students on Pier 60 at Chelsea Piers in New York City."
"The school has since expanded nationwide, with additional campuses in Baton Rouge, Chicago, Connecticut, Delaware, Denver, Houston, Memphis, Nashville, New Orleans, Newark, Philadelphia, Camden, and San Antonio."
= = = Hovey Fund = = =
"The Hovey Fund was created by a bequest from Charles Fox Hovey (1807-1859), a Boston merchant who supported a variety of social reform movements. Hovey left $50,000 to support abolitionism and other types of social reform, including ""women's rights, non-resistance, free trade and temperance."""
"Hovey appointed a committee of trustees to administer the fund, headed by abolitionist Wendell Phillips. Hovey specified that the funds should be spent at the rate of $8,000 per year to meet immediate needs."
The fund paid Susan B. Anthony's salary ($12 per week) while she coordinated the Women's Loyal National League's massive petition drive asking Congress to approve an amendment that would abolish slavery.
"With 400,000 signatures, it was the largest petition drive in the nation's history up to that time, gathering signatures from approximately one out every twenty-four adults in the Northern states and significantly contributing to the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution."
"Lettershandoney or Lettershendony ( or ""Leitir Seandomhnaigh"" meaning ""hillside of the old church"") is a small village and townland in County Londonderry, Northern Ireland, six miles to the southeast of Derry and three miles east of Drumahoe. In the 2001 census it had a population of 506 people. It is situated within Derry and Strabane district."
"Lettershandoney has ten recorded spellings of its name, dating back to 1613."
"In 2009 Lettershandoney and District Development Group carried out a community audit, highlighting the problems of the Lettershandoney Estate, the main housing area of the village, in terms of high unemployment, poverty and ill health, vandalism and alcohol and drug abuse, as well as lack of community facilities. In August 2011, a Lettershandoney Strategic Vision and Action Plan was produced by consultants on behalf of ARC (Assisting Rural Communities) north west. The resulting village plan aims to enhance community facilities and services, as well as environmental quality and transport, while protecting the character of the village. The village has some 150 houses and a primary school."

"Tim O'Shea (born January 13, 1962) is an American college basketball coach, most recently the head coach of the men's basketball team at Bryant University. He was previously the head coach at Ohio University."
"Born in Woodbury, New Jersey, O'Shea earned All-America accolades while playing at Wayland High School in Wayland, Massachusetts. He played college basketball at Boston College from 1980-84 under Gary Williams. During his time at BC, O'Shea and the Eagles won two Big East regular-season titles. O'Shea also earned four postseason tournament berths during his career, with BC advancing twice to the NCAA Tournament Sweet Sixteen and once to the Elite Eight."
"O'Shea earned a bachelor's degree in communications with a minor in English from Boston College in 1984, then added a master's degree in counseling/psychology from BC two years later."
"Upon graduation from Boston College, O'Shea became a graduate assistant at Rhode Island for the 1984-85 season before returning to The Heights as a grad assistant at BC from 1985-86. After a two-year stint as an assistant at Yale, O'Shea returned to URI, joining Al Skinner's staff, where he stayed for nine seasons. While on the Rams staff, O'Shea was a part of two NCAA Tournament bids along with two NIT bids. He is credited with recruiting Cuttino Mobley among others to URI. O'Shea followed Skinner and returned to his alma mater once again after Skinner accepted the Boston College job in 1997. He remained on the staff until 2001, when he landed his first head coaching gig at Ohio, just a year after the Eagles won both the Big East regular season and tournament titles, finishing with a 27–5 record and earning three-seed in the NCAA Tournament."
"In his first season in charge of the Bobcats, O'Shea guided the team to a 17–11 record, including wins overDePaul and North Carolina. A year later, O'Shea and Ohio posted a 14–16 record, with the season highlighted by a victory over Virginia."
"Following the 2002–03 season, forward Brandon Hunter became the first Bobcat selected in the NBA Draft since 1995 when the Boston Celtics selected him in the second round. A year later, after losing Hunter, sixth-man Sonny Johnson and three-point shooter Steve Esterkamp, the 2003–04 Bobcats slipped to a 10–20 record, but bounced back in 2004–05, posting a 21–11 record en route to the NCAA Tournament."
"The 2004–05 Bobcats captured significant non-conference victories against San Francisco, Butler and Detroit, then won 11 of their last 15 contests down the stretch. O'Shea won the MAC Tournament but their run ended in the first round of the NCAA Tournament against Florida, falling 67–62, overcoming a 20-point second-half deficit, but coming up just short."
"With expectations high in 2005–06, O'Shea and Ohio compiled 19 victories before falling to eventual league champion Kent State in the MAC Tournament semifinals. The Bobcats registered victories at Marist, Rhode Island and Toledo, against Akron and Samford at home, and took 18th-ranked Kentucky to the wire in Cincinnati, Ohio."
"From 2003 until O'Shea's departure in 2008, Ohio would have five-straight winning seasons with at least 19 wins each season. O'Shea was 120–95 in eight seasons in charge."
"O'Shea returned to his New England roots when he signed an eight-year contract to take over the head coaching duties at Bryant as the school transitioned to a full Division I member of the Northeast Conference. The Bulldogs broke through in the Bulldogs' first season of full Division I eligibility in 2012-13, winning 19 games and hosting a game in the College Basketball Invitational."
"Bryant went 16-15 the following season with an NEC semifinal appearance, but the Bulldogs failed to make the NEC Tournament in two of O'Shea's final three seasons at the helm, including an injury-plagued 2017-18 campaign in which Bryant's four leading scorers made a total of four starts together, all in the month of November."
"On February 12, 2018, O'Shea announced his retirement from Bryant, effectively at the end of the 2017–18 season."

"From Mandaluyong City, Buncio is the son of Gregorio ""Yoyong"" Buncio, a motorcycle racer, mechanic, and modifier. His mother is Mylene Buncio. He has four other siblings, namely Lourdes, Shara, Jacquelyn, and Barny."
"Buncio's father gave him the name ""Maico"" from a European motorcycle brand. At the age of three, he had started to learn riding motorcycles before bicycles. His training began early under the mentoring of his experienced father."
Buncio started his motocross competition career at the age of eight. He won first place in the 1996 FBO Motorcross Series 50cc category for ten years old and below held at the TRAKSNIJAK Race Track in Tagaytay City.
"At the age of 14, Buncio represented the Philippines in Perris, California at the FMF Memorial Day Motorcross Races, winning first place in the Mini Class 85cc for the 14 years old and below category."
"Buncio took up Bachelor of Science in Commerce, Major in Entrepreneurship at the University of Santo Tomas. Buncio was a consistent honor student since elementary and studied in OB Montessori until high school. He also finished his computer New Media Design Course from Phoenix One Knowledge Solutions in Makati on his latter years."
"Buncio was the sole representative of the Philippines in the 2004 Yamaha ASEAN Cup held at Shah Alam, Malaysia, where he raced against competitors from Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Indonesia. He won the fourth overall title for the country despite having to start from the back of the grid and having to race against five representing riders each from the other competing countries. This feat earned him the title Rookie of the Year from the organizers of said event."
Yamaha rider Buncio dominated the underbone racing 150 cc category for four years since 2006 before placing second to Suzuki rider Johnlery Enriquez in the 2010 event sponsored by Motorcycle Taipei Research Team and PAGCOR Sports.
"Buncio also broke records at the 3.2-kilometer Batangas Racing Circuit with a lap time of one minute, 49 seconds (400cc Superbike category) and two minutes, seven seconds (Underbone category)."
"2007 was the ""most memorable"" for Buncio when, at the age of 19, he broke the winning streak of ten-time Rider of the Year, Jolet Jao in the 2007 Shell Advance Superbikes Series. Buncio held the Superbike National Champion title for the next three years."
He also finished a race in the AMA Superbike 600cc class in Laguna Seca U.S.A. on September 2008.
"In 2009, Buncio was chosen as the endorser for Accel Sports Sporteum Philippines Inc."
Buncio was also awarded the Golden Wheel Awards Driver of the Year in 2010 and 2011.
He has ridden mostly Yamaha bikes in his entire career with Factory Yamaha and YRS until he signed for Team Suzuki Pilipinas in late 2010
"Maico was also a businessman, opened his own YRS Motorcycle Racing shop in Caloocan, and was a race director of the Moto ROC underbone race series. He is a big fan of Valentino Rossi of MotoGP and always dreamed to compete in international motorcycle racing."
"He often carries his trademark logo and the iconic race number ""129"" usually in a form of a sticker on his apparel and motorcycles."
"Maico Buncio fell a high speed accident on 15 May 2011 during the Superbike qualifying race at the Clark International Speedway Racing Circuit. While passing a semi-straight right hand sweeper on the speedway, Buncio's Suzuki GSX-R 600 motorbike slid and crashed into the run-off section. He was thrown off his bike and landed on an unfinished barrier in the race track. Buncio crashed onto a protruding steel rod of the barrier, which punctured his internal organs, fatally damaging his kidney and liver."
Buncio was thrown off some 100 meters from his bike and was impaled on a protruding reed bar in an unfinished barrier on the Clark Speedway Circuit. He was rushed to a nearby hospital in Mabalacat and transferred to the UST Hospital in the wee hours of 15 May and was pronounced dead at 3:57 PM on the same day due to massive internal bleeding. The father of the late superbike champion Maico Buncio raised questions over the first aid procedure done on the rider during his fatal crash at the Clark Speedway Circuit.
"He said that the Aeromed's medical response team pulled the victim's body from the steel bar. This, he said, might have caused his son's death. The bar punctured his body and damaged his kidney and liver. Instead of cutting the steel bar to free Maico, the AeroMed emergency staffers decided to pull the young motorcycle champion free from his entanglement. This, they learned later, caused massive internal damage to Maico's organs and prompted him to scream in pain."
"Dr. Reynante Mirano, chief of St. Luke’s Hospital Emergency Medicine, said that instead of pulling Buncio’s body from the protruding metal, the medics should have cut the steel bar."
"Maico Buncio left a memorable quote to his fellow riders ""Never stop riding, because I didn't."""
Buncio's wake was held in the Loyola Memorial Chapels in Makati City and he was laid to rest in the Loyola Memorial Park in Marikina City on 21 May 2011. A motorcade organized by his fellow riders marked his funeral procession.

"The Dick's Sporting Goods Pittsburgh Marathon, commonly referred to as the Pittsburgh Marathon, is an annual marathon footrace held on the first Sunday in May in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the United States. The Marathon was first announced on October 3, 1984 with U.S. Steel and PNC Bank as sponsors. From 1985 to 2003, the race was held annually and named the UPMC/City of Pittsburgh Marathon, although serious financial difficulty within the City of Pittsburgh municipal budget and UPMC's withdraw from title sponsor led to suspension of the race from 2004 to 2008. In 2009, the event was revived with a new title sponsor, Dick's Sporting Goods, and renewed interest in the race."
"The 1988 and 2000 races were USA Olympic Trials for women and men, that were held separately from the regular event although both were held over the same course."
"Aside from the main marathon event, several races occur during the weekend of the marathon, including a half marathon, two to five person marathon relay, 5k race, and ""kids marathon."" All races except for the ""kids marathon"" and 5k utilize the same route and starting time as the marathon. Attendance and popularity of the events has risen greatly since the 2009 revival. The 2012 race had the largest field in the history of the race. Registration for 2012 closed with roughly 25,000 participants between all races, with 6,000 entrants in the full marathon, 13,000 entrants in the half marathon, and 800 teams in the marathon relay, with the remaining entrants distributed in the 5K. Additionally, an estimated 60,000 spectators lined the course, and 4,000 volunteers provided assistance. 2012 also marked the earliest sellout in the race's history with all events except the 5k selling out on or before March 6, 2012."
"Historically, the course has wound through the unique and hilly topography of the city. Crossing five different bridges, the course traverses all three rivers of Pittsburgh's at least once. The start and finish lines have changed many times, but have always been in either Downtown or North Shore. Previous finish lines have included Point State Park, David L. Lawrence Convention Center, and the 50 yard-line of Heinz Field. The current finish line is on the Boulevard of the Allies near Point State Park. Numerous other historic and well-known Pittsburgh neighborhoods are along the route, including the South Side, Oakland, Shadyside, East Liberty, Highland Park, Bloomfield, Lawrenceville, and the Strip District."
"Throughout the course, thousands of neighborhood residents show their support by lining the streets of the course and volunteering at aid stations. Neighborhood organizations are awarded financial grants for community-engaging celebrations along the route. Sixty bands, almost all of which are from the Greater Pittsburgh area, line the streets throughout the course, spanning a range of musical genres."
"The Pittsburgh Marathon hosted the United States Olympic Marathon Trials for men in 2000 and the US Olympic Trials for women in 1988. In addition, it has served as the site for the United States men's national championship three times, the National Wheelchair Championship in 1986, as well as the Olympic Marathon Trials for both Finland and Denmark in the 1980s."

"= = = An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman = = ="
"""An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman"" is the opening line of a category of joke popular in Ireland and the United Kingdom. The nationalities involved may vary, though they are usually restricted to those within Ireland and the UK, and the number of people involved is usually three or sometimes four. In Ireland, the characters are sometimes called ""Paddy Irishman, Paddy Englishman, and Paddy Scotsman"". Depending on who is telling the joke, one nationality fares well and the other nationalities fare poorly according to national stereotypes. For example, in England the punchline is usually based around the Irishman being stupid, the Scotsman being mean or miserly, and the Englishman being posh (or a snob but ultimately not the butt of the joke), whereas in Scotland and Ireland, the Englishman will typically be the butt of the joke. Sometimes, when the joke requires four people, a Welshman is brought in."
"The joke typically starts with the home or favoured nationality and ends with the nationality and associated stereotype against which the joke is made. For example, in England, the joke begins ""An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman..."" whereas in Ireland it begins ""Paddy Irishman, Paddy Englishman, and Paddy Scotsman""."
"The joke typically places the three characters in a scenario. How each person in the joke reacts to the scenario is then explained in order by person, the final reaction being the punch line, playing up to the stereotype of that nationality. The joke uses the rule of three, the first two characters being used to set up an expectation which is then subverted in some way by the third."
"The ""three nationalities"" joke format is also very common in other countries. In these cases, the two foreigners are almost always portrayed as cocky, stupid, or naïve, while the home national is smart, practical, or in any case ultimately victorious."
"The joke need not necessarily involve nationalities. Jokes about the hard sciences may begin ""A mathematician, a physicist and an engineer..."""

His 189 set a new record for Pakistan's highest Test score which lasted only until Ahmed (who made 209) overtook it the next day. Hasan played five more Tests without reaching 50."

Kenton Road is a main road in the London Borough of Harrow and the London Borough of Brent. It lies in the areas of Harrow and Kenton.
"Its eastern end is the border of Kenton in Middlesex and Kingsbury (in NW9) in London. Kenton Road is the A4006, apart from a short stretch west of Northwick Park roundabout, which is a small part of the A404. The road east of the Kenton Methodist Church originally followed the route of what is now Woodgrange Avenue and was a continuation of Kenton Lane before being upgraded, re-positioned and renamed in the early 20th century as an eastward extension of the original Kenton Road."
"On the north side of the road, almost opposite Kenton station is the Traveller's Rest pub. Approximately further along the A4006, also on the north side of the road, at the junction with St Leonard's Avenue, is the parish church of St Mary-the-Virgin, Kenton, built in 1935-1936 by the architect Harold Gibbons and a local firm of builders, Melsom & Rosier. Approximately further on, on the south side of the Kenton Road is All Saints Catholic Church, built in 1963. About another further on is the Greek Orthodox Church of St Panteleimon. Originally a mission church of the Church of England parish, it was acquired in recent years by the Greek community, which has replaced it with a traditional Greek Basilica complete with bronze dome (2011)."
"As late as 1935 there was a busy blacksmith's forge in Kenton Lane, from the junction with Kenton Road (the junction at that time called 'Brockhurst Corner').

"After military service, he drew cartoons for ""The Saturday Evening Post"", ""The New Yorker"" and ""Esquire"". As a freelance illustrator, he contributed to numerous magazines, including ""Collier's"", ""Redbook"" and ""McCall's"". He was a founder of the National Society of Magazine Illustrators."
"He began drawing ""Abbie an' Slats"" in 1937. The strip followed the experiences of a rural spinster raising her young cousin, a streetwise urban child. It was the idea of Al Capp, who intended to start a second strip to build upon the success of his popular ""Li'l Abner"". Instead of drawing it himself, Capp recruited Van Buren. Initially, Van Buren turned him down, but he was soon lured by the prospect of steady work, as he had just had his first and only child with his wife, Fern. The strip was carried in 400 newspapers but did not equal the popularity of ""Li'l Abner"". Capp abandoned the strip in 1945, turning the writing chores over to his brother, Elliot Caplin. Van Buren stayed on the strip, and it ended with his retirement in 1971."
"Van Buren lived in Great Neck, Long Island. When he died in 1987 at North Shore Community Hospital in Manhasset, Long Island, after suffering an injury in a fall, he was 96 years old."
"In 1984, When Van Buren sent a gift to ""Dear Abby"" columnist Abigail Van Buren (Pauline Phillips), she wrote back on November 30, 1984, thanking him and commenting on the name similarity:"
"With the Gold Key Award, he was honored in 1979 as a member of the National Cartoonists Society Hall of Fame. In 1958, he was named ""Cartoonist of the Year"" by the Quaker City Lodge of the B'nai B'rith in ceremonies at Philadelphia Pa. Previous winners were Al Capp, Milton Caniff, and George Wunder."
"Van Buren's wartime experiences are chronicled in the book ""Duty, Honor, Privilege: New York's Silk Stocking Regiment the Breaking of the Hindenburg Line"" by his grandnephew Stephen L. Harris. Beginning with ""Abbie an' Slats and Becky"" (Saalfield, 1940), his comic strip was collected in several books."

"On July 25 to 29, 1913 a survey began by a man named David Townsend from Calgary, Alberta plotting out the new community. Residents of the community decided that the name of their community should be named after ""Crichton"" a Scottish poet and scholar, James Crichton born in Perthshire in 1560."
"During its day as an incorporated settlement, Crichton had three grain elevators all have been torn down, a school that has been moved to a nearby bible camp, a café and pool hall, a garage that still stand on main street, boarding house, a blacksmith shop, lumberyard, post office, livery barn, water tower torn down in the 1960s, and a large warehouse attached to the general store.

= = = Ziamet = = =
"Ziamet was a form of land tenure in Ottoman Empire, consisting in grant of lands or revenues by the Ottoman Sultan to an individual in compensation for his services, especially military services. The ziamet system was introduced by Osman I who granted land tenure to his troops. Later this system was expanded by Murad I for his Sipahi."
"The Saljuq state, prior to the rise of the Ottoman State in the 14th century, utilized ziamets in an effort to implement provincial governors, who were also made subordinate chiefs in the military regime. In this pre-Ottoman period, timars were used with other tactics, such as building caravansaries, in an effort to sedentarize nomadic groups. The Ottoman state later took on this ""timar system"" after conquering Anatolia, and it represented just one of several institutions apparent in the Ottoman Empire derived from the Saljuq state."
"The Ottoman Empire came into disarray due to problems asserting ""central government control"" during the 16th and 17th centuries. They needed a way to reassert their military might. Ziamets of Ottoman cavalry were enlarged and turned over to a smaller number of owners, with a longer tenure. Thus, authority in provincial areas turned to police authority as local administrations dissolved, and ziamets were converted into tax-farms or iqta. This conversion of ziamets into tax-farms proved to be the first step to growing provincial control in the Ottoman Empire, as economic decline in the empire gave these stronger provincial governors the chance to assert power.[3]"
"The ziamet-holder acted as an agent of the central Ottoman government in supervising the possession, transfer, and rental of lands within his territory and collecting tax revenue, in return for military service. A timar was not necessarily made up of contiguous property, but could consist of property scattered among different villages."
A timar-holder is a zaim.

= = = Bishop Chatard High School = = =
"Bishop Chatard High School is a Catholic co-educational preparatory high school located in the Broad Ripple district of Indianapolis, Indiana in the United States. It is named after Bishop Silas Chatard, who was the first Bishop of Indianapolis, and oversaw the movement of the diocese from Vincennes to Indianapolis in 1898."
"The increase in Indiana's Catholic population that triggered the splitting of the Indianapolis diocese in 1944 also caused an increase in the need for Catholic schools. It was clear that one high school would not be sufficient to provide for Indianapolis' massively expanding Catholic population. To this end, the Archbishop of Indianapolis, Paul Clarence Schulte, ordered the construction of three new Catholic high schools in the city. The first of these, Bishop Chatard, would serve the north side of Indianapolis. The two other new schools, Roncalli High School and Cardinal Ritter High School, would serve the south and west sides of Indianapolis respectively. Scecina would continue to serve the east side of the city."
"Ground was broken for the first of the schools, Bishop Chatard, in the fall of 1960 on diocese property at the corner of Crittenden and Kessler Avenues. Construction of the school and an adjacent convent was completed in less than a year, and the first students were admitted in September 1961. Each year a class of students was added to the school, and the first graduating class was the class of 1964-65. Over the years, many improvements were made to the school facility as the number of students rose."
"Initially, classes were taught almost entirely by priests from the Archdiocese of Indianapolis and Benedictine Sisters of Beech Grove. Many sisters were housed in the convent on-site, but their numbers declined to the point that in the 1970s, their convent was converted to an annex of the school. The annex has served as classroom, office and storage space for thirty years, and was recently rededicated to the Sisters as the St. Benedict Center."
"By 1997, the school was showing its age. Paint was peeling, windows and roofs were leaky, and facilities sorely needed an upgrade. To remedy the situation and remodel the 35-year-old building, school administrators embarked on a $2 million capital campaign to pay for new windows, a new roof, electrical improvements, and other needed renovations. These were undertaken over the summer, and when students arrived to begin the 1997-1998 school year, they were in what was virtually a whole new building."
"In 1999, improvements continued with the opening of the new fine arts addition. A new band room, art studio, and library were added, as were six new classrooms and an elevator to make the building handicap-accessible. This was paid for by a $1.5 million building drive made possible by alumni donations."
"In the summer of 2005, and completed over the 2007-08 school year, a campaign involved the construction of an additional elevator to allow better access to classrooms for handicapped students and a remodeling of the cafeteria and several hallways. A new auxiliary gymnasium was paid for by alumni donations and a slight tuition increase. In 2011, President Bill Sahm announced the “Golden Opportunities Campaign,” to address several issues including the creation of a tuition assistance endowment and a teacher compensation endowment. The Campaign also addressed improvements to the academic environment including the addition of robust wireless network throughout the two buildings, new servers and expanded student and teacher access to 21st century computers in the classrooms and labs. The Campaign also addressed the needs of the athletic community with the addition of a competition track and fields including a new turf field and all-weather track with bleacher seating for 900, stadium lighting and a concession/restroom facility, as well as a turf baseball field and a one-mile walk/run trail."
Bishop Chatard has been accredited by AdvancED or its predecessors since April 2004.

Blanca de la Cerda y Lara ( – 1347) was a Spanish noblewoman.
"She was the daughter of Fernando de la Cerda (1275–1322) and Juana Núñez de Lara, called ""la Palomilla""."

= = = Thomas Devin = = =
"Thomas Casimer Devin (December 10, 1822 – April 4, 1878) was a United States Army officer and general. He commanded Union cavalry during the American Civil War and during the Indian Wars."
"Born in New York City to Irish parents. Devin was a house painter and partner in a paint and varnish company with his brother John for much of his early life, while also serving as a lieutenant colonel in the New York State Militia."
"After the start of the Civil War, Devin formed his militia cavalry company into ""Captain Devin's Independent Company"" and served as its captain. Late that year, he became Colonel of the 6th New York Volunteer Cavalry, nicknamed the ""2nd Ira Harris Guards"", which he would lead for the next year."
"The regiment's first important service was in the Maryland Campaign of 1862. At the Battle of Antietam, one of its squadrons was involved in the first attacks of the day. At the Battle of Fredericksburg, Devin inherited command of David McMurtrie Gregg's cavalry brigade, when the latter took charge of the brigade of George Dashiell Bayard, who had been killed by Confederate artillery fire. At the Battle of Chancellorsville in 1863, his small brigade was the only cavalry not detached for Brig. Gen. George Stoneman's raid and he successfully led three Union Corps on the stealthy flanking march that preceded the battle. The men of the brigade repeatedly distinguished themselves in the heavy fighting of the battle. They suffered almost 200 casualties in the battle, higher losses than Union cavalry units had seen prior to that time. Devin also led his brigade in the Battle of Brandy Station (June 9, 1863), and took command of Brig. Gen. John Buford's division while Buford commanded the entire right wing of the two-pronged attack on Confederate cavalry. While observing the skirmish line early in the fighting, Devin had his horse shot out from under him."
"At the Battle of Gettysburg, Devin's brigade served in Brig. Gen. John Buford's cavalry division that began the battle on July 1, 1863. Devin had become a favorite of Buford's and his rugged leadership style lent him the nickname ""Buford's Hard Hitter,"" while his own men like to refer to him as ""Uncle Tommy."" As the Confederate attacks began, Devin's brigade was screening the northwest and northern road approaches to Gettysburg, and successfully delayed the arrival of Jubal A. Early's division. Friendly fire from Union artillery on Cemetery Hill caused most of his brigade to withdraw into the town of Gettysburg and they later skirmished with the Confederates as they entered the town. The two brigades of Buford's cavalry division present on the field on July 1 and 2 were withdrawn from the battlefield by Cavalry Corps commander Alfred Pleasonton on the afternoon of July 2."
"After Gettysburg, Devin continued to command a brigade and sometimes a division in the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac. In the spring of 1864, he participated in the raid on Richmond by Judson Kilpatrick's cavalry. In August he accompanied the Cavalry Corps to the Shenandoah Valley, where they fought under Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan during the Valley Campaigns of 1864. Devin was wounded once during the war, a wound in the foot on August 16, 1864, at the fighting at Guard Hill, Virginia or Crooked Run, Virginia. When Wesley Merritt became the Cavalry Corps commander, Devin inherited command of his division. On November 19, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln appointed Devin brigadier general of volunteers for his part in the Battle of Cedar Creek, to rank from October 19, 1864. The President submitted the nomination on December 12, 1864, and the U.S. Senate confirmed it on February 14, 1865."
"Devin was mustered out of the volunteer service on January 15, 1866. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Devin for appointment to the brevet grade of major general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866. President Johnson also appointed Devin brevet colonel in the regular army for Fisher's Hill, to rank from March 2, 1867. On March 26, 1867, President Johnson nominated Devin for appointment to the brevet grade of brigadier general in the regular army for Sayler's Creek, to rank from March 2, 1867, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on April 5, 1867."
"Devin obtained a commission in the Regular Army after the Civil War under the provisions of the Army Act of 1866. This Act required that the officer ranks of the new infantry and cavalry regiments be filled by a certain percentage of officers from the Volunteer regiments raised during the Civil War. Ending the war as a Brigadier General and Brevet Major General, Devin became a Lieutenant Colonel and was assigned to the 8th U.S. Cavalry. Initially serving with part of the regiment in New Mexico, Devin assumed command of the Subdistrict of Prescott in Arizona in late 1867. He died of stomach cancer and exposure, on sick leave from active duty, as Colonel of the 3rd U.S. Cavalry. Devin was initially interred in Calvary Cemetery on Long Island, but upon his wife's death in 1897, both were interred in West Point Cemetery, West Point, New York, very near his old friend and commander John Buford."
"On June 30, 1878, the United States Army established a temporary camp in southeastern Montana Territory during the building of the Fort Keogh-Deadwood Telegraph Line. The post was named ""Camp Devin."" It served as a base for part of the 9th U.S. Infantry until being abandoned later that year."
"Devin was portrayed by David Carpenter in the 1993 film ""Gettysburg"", based on Michael Shaara's novel, ""The Killer Angels""."

"The great dodecahemicosacron is the dual of the great dodecahemicosahedron, and is one of nine dual hemipolyhedra. It appears visually indistinct from the small dodecahemicosacron."
"Since the hemipolyhedra have faces passing through the center, the dual figures have corresponding vertices at infinity; properly, on the real projective plane at infinity. In Magnus Wenninger's ""Dual Models"", they are represented with intersecting prisms, each extending in both directions to the same vertex at infinity, in order to maintain symmetry. In practice the model prisms are cut off at a certain point that is convenient for the maker. Wenninger suggested these figures are members of a new class of stellation figures, called ""stellation to infinity"". However, he also suggested that strictly speaking they are not polyhedra because their construction does not conform to the usual definitions."
The great dodecahemicosahedron can be seen as having ten vertices at infinity.
= = = Pagri = = =
"Pagri or Phari (; ) is a town in Yadong County in the Tibet Autonomous Region, China near the border with Bhutan. the town had a population of 2,121. It is one of the highest towns in the world, being about above sea-level at the head of the Chumbi Valley."
"Thomas Manning, the first Englishman to reach Lhasa, visited Pagri from 21September until 5November 1811 and had this to say about his room in the town: ""Dirt, dirt, grease, smoke. Misery, but good mutton."" Pagri was of some military importance in the early 20th century when it was occupied by the British Tibet Expedition under Francis Younghusband in 1904. The Pagri Fortress (""Dzong"") was located here and was important for the government as it stood between Tibet and Bhutan. Pagri was a staging area en route to Gyantse and ultimately Lhasa."
"During the summer of 1912, the 13th Dalai Lama met Agvan Dorzhiev at Phari Dzong and then accompanied him to the Samding Monastery, before returning to Lhasa after his exile in India."
"Thubten Ngodup, the current Nechung Oracle, was born in Phari in 1957."
"The houses are mostly made of Tibetan traditional stone and wood. The Pagri Valley lies in an alpine steppe zone on the south side, with an average annual temperature , and an extreme maximum temperature of . Annual precipitation is about , snow and ice melt forming rich water resources, shrubs and meadows development, a good place for the development of animal husbandry. Pagri is rich in minerals, wild animals, plants, and tourism resources. It is also a trading centre but due to geographical location is prone to natural disasters. Summer flash floods, mudslides, winter avalanches, snowstorms, etc. are common, and poor facilities makes it vulnerable to disaster. During the rainy season, water levels rise causing serious flooding, reducing soil quality and arable land every year, damaging the ecological environment and a threat to the inhabitants of Pagri. To the northeast of Pagri is Mount Jomolhari."
"Owing to its extreme altitude, Pagri has an alpine climate (Köppen ""ETH"") that is too cold to permit the growth of trees, even though the altitude is still marginally too low for the formation of permafrost. Example Mount Fuji in Japan, Uelen in Russia and Longyearbyen in Svalbard Norway. The winter is severe in spite of the fact that no month has daytime maxima below , and also very dry and long, extending as late as May. Snowfall, however, is rare because of the dryness. Summers, during which the great majority of precipitation occurs, are cool even at their warmest and consistently damp, even though the Himalayas prevent falls from ever being heavy."
= = = Great icosihemidodecahedron = = =
"In geometry, the great icosihemidodecahedron (or great icosahemidodecahedron) is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U. Its vertex figure is a crossed quadrilateral."
It is a hemipolyhedron with 6 decagrammic faces passing through the model center.
"Its convex hull is the icosidodecahedron. It also shares its edge arrangement with the great icosidodecahedron (having the triangular faces in common), and with the great dodecahemidodecahedron (having the decagrammic faces in common)."
"There is some controversy on how to colour the faces of this polyhedron. Although the common way to fill in a polygon is to just colour its whole interior, this can result in some filled regions hanging as membranes over empty space. Hence, the ""neo filling"" is sometimes used instead as a more accurate filling. In the neo filling, orientable polyhedra are filled traditionally, but non-orientable polyhedra have their faces filled with the modulo-2 method (only odd-density regions are filled in)."

"Rainulf II, called Trincanocte, was the fourth Count of Aversa (1045–1048), the cousin of his immediate predecessor Asclettin and nephew of Rainulf Drengot, the founder of their family's fortunes in the Mezzogiorno. There was a succession crisis after the premature death of Asclettin and Guaimar IV of Salerno, as suzerain of Aversa, tried to impose his candidate on the Normans, but they elected Trincanocte and he prevailed in getting Guaimar's recognition too. In 1047, he was present at a council with Pandulf IV of Capua and Guaimar, where the former was returned to his princely position and the latter's great domain was broken up. The feudal titles of Rainulf and Drogo of Hauteville, count of Apulia, were confirmed by the Emperor Henry III and they were made his direct vassals. Within a year, Trincanocte died and was succeeded by his infant son Herman under the regency of his cousin Richard, whom he had originally spurned, believing him to be a dangerous rival. Soon, Herman was displaced (or worse) and Richard was count."

"Todd Nauck is an American comic book artist and writer. Nauck is most notable for his work on ""Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man,"" ""Young Justice"" and his own creation, ""Wildguard""."
"Nauck's first assignment from Marvel Comics was writing, penciling and inking ""Mutant Mishaps"", a story that was published on the back cover of ""What The--?!"" #21 (September 1992). He subsequently wrote and illustrated the ""Mutant Mishaps"" story that appeared in ""What The--?"" #25 (Summer 1993)."
"In early 1994, Todd was hired by Rob Liefeld's Extreme Studios of Image Comics when a friend from art school showed his ""WildGuard"" work to Dan Fraga at a comic book convention, who in turn showed it to Liefeld, which led to Nauck's first Image work. Nauck went on to draw such series as ""Badrock and Co."", ""New Men"", ""New Force"", ""Supreme"", ""Youngblood"" and ""Team Youngblood"". By 1997, Nauck began work with DC Comics. After drawing several ""Legion of Superheroes"" stories, he helped launch the ""Young Justice"" series with writer Peter David. Nauck drew 53 issues of the 55 issue run of the series, including three double-sized issues and a portion of the ""Young Justice/Spyboy"" crossover mini-series."
"Nauck published his creator-owned series, ""Wildguard"", with Image Comics. The series was patterned after a reality television show competition, in which various wannabe superheroes competed for a spot on a new superhero team, and judged by a panel of judges, as on the television series ""American Idol""."

"WPXT, virtual channel 51 (UHF digital channel 43), is a CW-affiliated television station licensed to Portland, Maine, United States, serving southern Maine and eastern and northern New Hampshire. The station is owned by the Hearst Television subsidiary of Hearst Communications, as part of a duopoly with Poland Spring-licensed ABC affiliate WMTW (channel 8). The two stations share studios on Ledgeview Drive in Westbrook; WPXT's transmitter is located in South Gray along I-95/Maine Turnpike/Gold Star Memorial Highway. There is no separate website for WPXT; instead, it is integrated with that of sister station WMTW."
"The station signed-on September 14, 1986 as Maine's first independent station and the first new commercial station to launch in the Portland market in 32 years. After a few weeks as an independent, it became a charter affiliate with Fox on October 6. In 1996, the station's original owner, Bride Communications, entered bankruptcy and WPXT was sold to Pegasus Broadcasting."
"In October 2001, WPXT switched to The WB due to a monetary dispute between Pegasus and Fox; The WB had previously aired in off-hours on sister UPN affiliate WPME (channel 35). This left Maine with no over-the-air Fox affiliate until April 2003, when Portland's Pax TV affiliate WMPX-TV (now WPFO) switched to the network and WFVX-LD signed on as the first over-the-air Fox affiliate for the Bangor area. In the interim, Fox's primetime and children's programming was only available on cable via WFXT (which was owned by the network at the time) for those living on the New Hampshire side of the market and via Foxnet for those living in Maine; WCKD-LP (which was initially expected to serve as the network's replacement affiliate) carried the network's sports programming during that time. Pegasus declared bankruptcy in June 2004 over a dispute with DirecTV (co-owned with Fox by News Corporation) over marketing of the direct broadcast satellite service in rural areas. The Pegasus station group was sold in August 2006 to private investment firm CP Media, LLC of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania for $55.5 million. Eventually, CP Media formed a new broadcast company, New Age Media."
"As a WB affiliate, WPXT was originally branded on-air as ""Maine's WB 51"", but in 2004, changed to ""Maine's WB"" to reflect its status as the only over-the-air WB affiliate in the state. Although Bangor and Presque Isle also had affiliates, they were only provided on cable through The WB 100+ (a similar operation to Foxnet)."
"On January 24, 2006, Time Warner and CBS Corporation announced that they would merge the broadcast operations of The WB and UPN to form The CW Television Network. On March 9, it was announced WPXT would become Portland's CW affiliate. Later on May 1, it was made public sister station WPME would affiliate with MyNetworkTV. With the new affiliation, WPXT's branding became ""The CW Portland"". In 2007, WPXT changed its on-air branding to reflect its call letters rather than a city."
"WPXT ceased analog transmission August 12, 2008 (more than seven months prior to the original Federal Communications Commission (FCC) digital switchover deadline February 17, 2009) due to transmitter failure. On May 2, 2011, WPXT signed-on a new second digital subchannel to become the area's MeTV affiliate. On November 7, 2016, Escape (now Court TV Mystery) was added to subchannel 51.3."
"New Age Media announced in March 2012 that it would sell WPXT to Tyche Broadcasting for $75,000. The deal was contingent on WPME's concurrent sale from MPS Media to Triumph Broadcasting. On November 9, 2012, WPXT filed a non-consummation notice to the FCC, meaning the transaction is nulled and void. On February 13, 2013, New Age Media filed to sell WPXT to Ironwood Communications for $1,525,000; the deal was concurrent with a planned sale of WPME to Cottonwood Communications. The FCC granted its approval of the sale on April 2. The sale was consummated on May 20."
"On March 22, 2018, MyNetworkTV, Escape and Laff programming was moved to WPXT's respective third, fourth and fifth subchannels; the three networks had been carried by WPME, which was concurrently sold to Ion Media Networks to become WIPL, an Ion Television owned-and-operated station. Hearst Television announced its acquisition of WPXT on July 30, 2018; the $3,350,000 purchase created a duopoly with ABC affiliate WMTW (channel 8). The sale was approved on September 12 and was completed on September 21, 2018; concurrently, WPXT changed its branding to ""Maine's CW."""
"The ownership change also resulted in a streamlining of subchannels between WMTW and WPXT the next month. With Hearst's preference for its main station in the market to carry the MeTV affiliation, MeTV and H&I exchanged places, with MeTV moving to WMTW-DT2 and H&I going to WPXT-DT2, and Laff going from WPXT-DT2 to WMTW-DT3, with Escape going to WPXT-DT3 (and the likely non-renewal of the Katz Broadcasting network agreement; Hearst only tends to carry Bounce TV from that provider). The syndicated programming formerly on WPXT-DT3's ""WPME"" service was removed, and MyNetworkTV programming now airs in place of H&I's primetime, or sometimes during the late night hours on WPXT-DT2, an arrangement similar to the setup for the third subchannel of sister station KCCI in Des Moines, Iowa."
The station's digital signal is multiplexed:
"Syndicated programming on WPXT includes ""Divorce Court"", ""The People's Court"", ""How I Met Your Mother"", ""Modern Family"", ""Mom"", ""Extra"", ""TMZ on TV"", and ""Chicago P.D."", among others. Throughout its history, WPXT has also produced and aired several local programs."
"For many years, WPXT operated a news department and produced its own local newscasts. For a time, the station's nightly prime time news at 10 was simulcasted on sister station WPME. WPXT even produced a weeknight broadcast at 7 on that station at one point but the show was eventually canceled due to poor ratings and inconsistent viewership. It made national headlines a week before the 2000 Presidential election when reporter Erin Fehlau (now at ABC affiliate WMUR-TV) revealed Republican candidate George W. Bush had been convicted for driving under the influence of alcohol 24 years earlier."
"On June 15, 2002, after shuttering its own news operation, WPXT entered into a news share agreement with Maine's two NBC affiliates, WCSH and WLBZ (then both owned by the Gannett Company). This arrangement resulted in a nightly half-hour prime time show at 10 to debut on the station known as ""NewsCenter at 10 on Maine's WB 51"". On weeknights, the news and sports segments originated from WCSH's studios at Congress Square in Downtown Portland while weather forecast segments came from WLBZ's facility on Mount Hope Avenue in Bangor. Weekend broadcasts aired entirely from Portland. The WPXT newscast featured a similar format to newscasts that were simulcast on both WCSH and WLBZ (which largely serves as a semi-satellite of WCSH), with statewide news from both the Portland and Bangor markets. However, since WPXT is a Portland/Auburn market station, there was ultimately a focus on southern areas. With the affiliation switch to The CW in 2006, WPXT's news became known as ""NewsCenter at 10 on The CW Portland""."
"WPXT would not face any competition in the time slot until February 5, 2007, when current Fox affiliate WPFO entered into a similar arrangement with CBS affiliate WGME-TV. On November 6, 2008, WCSH moved the WPXT show to its second digital subchannel affiliated with NBC Weather Plus. As a result, WLBZ's production involvement in the newscast was dropped and refocused to Portland. After a six-year run, the production was eventually canceled altogether."
"On October 31, 2011, WPXT and WCSH established another news share agreement and debuted an hour-long extension of the big three outlet's weekday morning show. Known on WPXT as ""NewsCenter Morning Report Xtra"", this aired from 7 until 8 and competed with WGME's one-hour morning newscast on WPFO. This ceased in Spring 2014."
"Following WPXT's sale to Hearst Television, the station announced that a WMTW-produced prime time newscast would premiere on September 24, 2018. A WMTW-produced Saturday 7 p.m. newscast premiered on August 31, 2019 and continues through the conclusion of ABC's college football coverage which necessitates the preemption of WMTW's usual 6 p.m. newscast."

Players can take two different jets into battle and switch between them using a collectable power-up. In all, there are nine different airplanes, thirty-three arenas, and five game modes. Most of the game modes fall into common categories such as search and destroy along with capture the flag."
"The PlayStation 2 version received ""mixed"" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Frank Provo, writing for GameSpot, said of the same console version that the developers deserved credit for ""creating a dog-fighting system that is simultaneously intuitive and diverse"". He went on to criticize the graphics, specifically, ""muddy textures, 2D explosions, blocky structures, disappearing polygons, and frequent slowdown"". David Smith of IGN shared similar sentiment with regards to the graphics of the same console version, noting the dull palette of greens, browns, and grays and the muddy textures. He went on to praise the simple controls and entertaining voice acting, but denounced the gameplay as dull and easy. He concluded that ""Four-player support should have been included."""

"Around the same time, Nero Bellum announced on Psyclon Nine's Facebook page that the band's new album would be titled """", and would be released in November 2013 with the help of the band's Bandcamp website page that allowed fans to donate to help raise funds for the album's production. In return, fans would receive different sorts of merchandise. Chris Vrenna of Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails helped produce a few tracks on the album."
"After a long hiatus, Psyclon Nine went on their first US tour in over four years co-headlined with Dawn of Ashes. Both Rotny Ford and Jon Siren returned, along with two musicians who were new to the band. They were Glitch Nix on synth, and Merritt Goodwin, on Bass."
"On November 12, 2013, Psyclon Nine released ""Order of the Shadow: Act I"" through Metropolis Records. The album continued the industrial black metal fusion previously heard on We the Fallen, but was heavily influenced by industrial rock, notably Marilyn Manson's Antichrist Superstar and Nine Inch Nails's The Downward Spiral."
"In February 2014, the band released a music video for the track 'Use Once and Destroy' on YouTube."
"On March 11, 2014, Psyclon Nine released a remix album entitled """". It featured remixes of from Falling Skies, Die Sektor, Alien Vampires, Dismantled, Misfit Toys, Modern Weapons, and Life Cried."
"The band had booked a European tour for May 2014, however the merchandise from Bandcamp was never shipped to the people who donated. This left many fans to believe that Nero had stolen from them once again."
"After the Bandcamp controversy, Rotny and Jon posted on the official Psyclon Nine Facebook page that both had quit the band due to Nero disappearing again, stating they felt he was irresponsible. Jon left a very apologetic letter to the fans on his personal Facebook page, explaining again how he and Rotny had nothing to do with the Bandcamp donations."
"On March 30, 2014, Nero Bellum explained on his personal Facebook page that he was in therapy and was unable to send out the Bandcamp orders. Due to Rotny and Jon quitting the band and other misunderstandings, Nero felt it was time to put an end to Psyclon Nine, canceling their European tour."
"Nero Bellum announced on his personal Facebook page that he wanted to perform one last series of concerts before putting an end to the band. Live band members Dorian Starchild (guitar), Brent Ashley (bass), and Kriz Dk (drums) joined Psyclon Nine for their final performances."
"A remix for the band Limnus entitled ""The Devils Are Inside the Walls"" (Psyclon Nine remix) was released in August 2014, followed by a second hiatus that lasted 8 months."
"On April 13, 2015, Psyclon Nine created a new official Facebook page and announced a live performance at the L.A. Dark United Underground in Los Angeles, CA on May 2, 2015. The reformed lineup featured Nero Bellum (vocals), Dorian Starchild (guitars), Ashes (guitars), and Raanen Bozzio (drums). They went on to do a few more shows (including a show at Bar Sinister in May 2015), resulting in Psyclon Nine returning as a live band. Raanen Bozzio was subsequently replaced by Anthem on electronic drums."
"During mid to late 2015 and throughout 2016, Psyclon Nine resolved their former Bandcamp and Kickstarter merchandise controversies by partnering with merchandise management company Black Umbrella based in Las Vegas, NV. Psyclon Nine's Bandcamp page was also given a major graphical update in late 2015 and continues to carry older legacy merchandise along with signed albums and new apparel designs for fans to purchase. All merchandise shipments to fans have returned to a normal schedule of being sent out every Saturday."
"On October 30, 2016, Psyclon Nine performed a special live set featuring songs exclusively from Divine Infekt, INRI and Crwn Thy Frnicatr. They played alongside label mates Dawn of Ashes for the first time in 3 years. Nero Bellum was also brought on stage during Dawn of Ashes' song ""Poisoning The Steps of Babel"" to provide vocals during his verse featured on the album. Nero also provided backing vocals during the chorus."
"On December 22, 2016 via Psyclon Nine's Facebook and Instagram pages, they announced the reissuing of their first album entitled ""Divine Infekt"". It has been remastered by Nero Bellum and is being made available in CD format and, for the first time ever, 12"" Vinyl format. The album will be re-released via Metropolis Records on March 24, 2017."
"During Spring of 2017, Psyclon Nine embarked on a small West Coast and East Coast tour entitled ""Infektion Divinum"". The tour was scheduled in tandem with the re-release of the band's first album ""Divine Infekt"". Psyclon Nine kept this tour exclusively ""electronic"" based sets in that it was performing songs from the albums ""Divine Infekt"", ""INRI"" and ""Crwn Thy Frnicatr"". This tour also marked the first time the band had ever played in Las Vegas, NV. Support acts for the tour included The Vile Augury, Lennon Midnight and Echo Black."
"Through mid to late 2017 via Nero Bellum's official Facebook page, he hinted of a new album in the works. In early 2018, the new album was officially confirmed and is entitled ""Icon of the Adversary: Act 2"". The band debuted the first new single from the upcoming album called ""Crown of the Worm"" during a live performance in Downey, CA on February 24 as well as a teaser via Nero Bellum's official YouTube channel. The new album is tentatively planned for release in August 2018. The band also released a new shirt design via their Bandcamp page based on one of the songs entitled ""Beware the Wolves"". In June 2018, via the band's official Facebook page, tour dates for ""Tour of the Worm"" were announced."
"Icon Of The Adversary was released on August 24, 2018 through Metropolis Records. Described as, ""the epitome of dark metal industrial,"" with violent, mechanical drums, scathing vocals, punishing guitars and evil electronics. With Nero Bellum saying, ""he had to travel to a very dark place to make this album, & it shows."""
= = = Australia's Naughtiest Home Videos = = =
"Australia's Naughtiest Home Videos is an Australian television comedy programme which was broadcast on Nine Network on 3 September 1992. It was a one-off special spin-off of ""Australia's Funniest Home Video Show"", depicting videos of sexual situations and other sexually explicit content. The programme was notably taken off the air partway through the broadcast of its first and only episode on the order of network owner Kerry Packer."
"""Australia's Funniest Home Video Show"" premiered in 1990, and was similar in concept to the 1989 American special (and later series) ""America's Funniest Home Videos:"" viewers would send in amateur-shot videos that were unintentionally humorous, and the video deemed the ""funniest"" by the studio audience was awarded a prize at the end of the show."
"The producers often received racy or risqué videos that couldn't be included into the programme due to its family-friendly nature, and since the show's policy stated that videos sent in by viewers couldn't be sent back, videos that didn't make it to the program were still kept by the station. The producers decided to compile these videos into a one-off special aimed at an adult audience."
"It differed from ""Australia's Funniest Home Video Show"" in more than just the content of the videos. It had a different opening, a modified version of the ""Australia's Funniest Home Video Show""'s theme song, and a slightly modified set. It was hosted by Australian radio personality Doug Mulray. Due to the difference in content, the show aired at 8:30 PM and was preceded by a short message warning viewers of the show's content, and informing them that it was a one-off special that was different from ""Australia's Funniest Home Video Show""."
"The show followed the same structure of ""Australia's Funniest Home Video Show"", in which the videos were shown in short blocks, interspersed with humorous monologues written and delivered by Mulray. Mulray often poked fun at the content of the videos, which he described as ""The most sensational collection of home videos since Rodney King nicked out for a pizza recently."" Mulray also did humorous voice overs as the videos were shown, similar to Lisa Patrick's on ""Australia's Funniest Home Video Show""."
"His ESPN debut was a second-round knockout of Sergio Rios on Wednesday Night Fights. Williams made his HBO debut against then-undefeated Walter Matthysse, winning by a tenth-round technical knockout. That was followed by a victory over former junior welterweight world champion Sharmba Mitchell. He knocked Mitchell down three times en route to a fourth-round TKO."
"Williams became the mandatory challenger for WBO Welterweight Champion Antonio Margarito. The match took place July 14, 2007, in Carson, California, at the Home Depot Center with Williams winning a unanimous decision in which turned out to be a close fight where Williams' seemingly stronger finish seemed to seal him the decision victory in the eyes of boxing experts and fans alike."
"Williams fought Carlos Quintana on February 9, 2008 in his first defense of his title. Williams lost to Quintana by decision in what many considered a minor upset."
"Williams and Quintana had a rematch at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Connecticut on June 7, 2008 for the WBO Welterweight title, at Williams' request. Williams got off to a quick start when a left hand sent Quintana into a daze as several follow-up barrages put Quintana down. He got up, but Williams opened up with dozens of unanswered punches as the referee jumped in to stop the fight while Quintana was going down again."
Williams was rumored to be moving up two weight classes to fight Kelly Pavlik for the WBC Middleweight title but instead Pavlik himself decided to move up two weight classes himself to fight Bernard Hopkins. Williams fought Andy Kolle on September 25. Williams dominated the fight from the start and recorded a first-round knockout in 1:37 seconds.
"After failing to secure another meaningful contest at welterweight, Williams vacated his WBO welterweight title in order to fight Verno Phillips for the WBO Interim Light Middleweight title."
"On November 29, 2008, Williams defeated Phillips by way of TKO after 8 rounds after the Doctor stopped the fight. In doing so he secured the WBO Interim Light Middleweight title."
"Williams fought Winky Wright on April 11, 2009, in a 12-round middleweight bout featured on HBO. Williams defeated Wright in a unanimous decision which was not close on the scorecards – two of the three judges gave Williams all but one round while the third scored all 12 rounds for Williams."
"Williams was then preparing to fight Middleweight Champion Kelly Pavlik in a bout scheduled to take place on October 3, 2009 in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The bout was postponed when it was discovered Pavlik had a staph infection in his knuckle and had been rescheduled for December 5. However, the bout was called off for a second time six weeks prior to the fight because Pavlik's infection had not completely healed."
"On December 5, 2009 Paul Williams fought Sergio Martínez in a war of a twelve-round main event. In the first round Martinez was knocked down due to bad balance and a grazing left hand that landed just below the ear. In the final seconds of the 1st round though Martinez scored a knockdown of his own over Williams. The next two rounds were heavily in Martinez's favor as he hit Williams with barrages of counter punches. After Martinez was seemingly won the first 3 rounds, rounds 4-7 showed Williams coming back effectively landing hard lefts to the head of Martinez. In rounds 8-10 Martinez again confused Williams with using different varieties of punches, including straight lead lefts to the body followed by right hooks to the head and straight lefts to the face. The final 2 rounds showed much fatigue in Martinez and Williams but both warriors fought through to the end, although Williams seemed to win both of the last 2 rounds by being the far more active boxer (while the punching exchanges were very closely contested during those final 2 rounds as well), which would ultimately prove to be the difference and as a result of having far superior activity during those final 2 rounds, Williams won a close majority decision over Martinez. The judges scored the fight 114-114, 115-113 for Williams and 119-110 for Williams, thus making Williams emerge as the majority decision winner."
"After his close win over Sergio Martínez, Paul Williams moved on to face Puerto Rican prospect Kermit Cintrón. The two met on May 8, 2010 Live on Saturday Night HBO Boxing. In the fourth round, Kermit Cintron fell out of the ring unintentionally and was not allowed to continue fighting due to hitting the arena floor. Williams was ahead on two of the three judges' scorecards at the time of the stoppage and was declared the winner by split technical decision. Cintron, who believed he should have been ahead on the scorecards, filed a complaint to have the ruling changed to a no-contest, claiming he was not given the five-minute recovery time allowed under California rules."
"A highly anticipated rematch with Sergio Martinez eventually materialized at Boardwalk Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey on November 20, 2010. Upon the Williams camp's insistence, the fight was contested at the catchweight limit of 158 pounds instead of the middleweight limit of 160, with Martinez's WBC Middleweight title on the line. The fight was billed as a potential ""fight-of-the-year,"" however the fight ended abruptly and dramatically when Sergio Martinez delivered a knockout blow with 2:02 left in the 2nd round. The punch was a short left cross that caught Williams right on the chin as he attempted to deliver a left-hand of his own. Williams' right hand was at his waist when the punch landed, rendering Paul Williams unconscious upon contact."
"On July 9, 2011, Paul Williams fought in a light middleweight contest in Atlantic City against former Cuban amateur sensation Erislandy Lara. Throughout the fight, Lara repeatedly hit Williams with hard left hands and appeared to have won the fight convincingly in the eyes of the HBO crew and those sitting at ringside. However, the judges awarded Williams with a narrow majority decision, a highly controversial verdict that ultimately led to the suspension of the three judges by the New Jersey Athletic Control Board."
"On May 27, 2012, Williams was severely injured when he crashed his motorcycle in Georgia. He swerved to avoid hitting a car while traveling at about 75 mph on the motorcycle and was launched sixty feet. Witnesses say he landed on his head and his body ""folded like a suitcase."" The accident left him with a part of his spinal cord severely bruised, paralyzing him from the waist down. Since it was bruised and not severed, it gives him a chance to regain sensation. The doctors told Williams the swelling could go down in a year or two, potentially giving him a chance of walking again. The accident came as Williams was preparing for his PPV main event against Canelo Alvarez on September 15. ""I'm just chilling in a wheelchair because I got tired of walking,"" Williams said in an interview with Jim Gray on ""Showtime Championship Boxing"" on the day he was supposed to fight. ""Whether I am walking or not walking, my game ain't over until the Lord takes my life."""

"Bride's Hill, known also as Sunnybrook, is a historic house near Wheeler, Alabama. It is one of the state's earliest surviving and most significant, examples of the Tidewater-type cottage. It was added to the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage on April 16, 1985 and to the National Register of Historic Places on July 9, 1986."
"A member of the Dandridge family, cousins of America's first First Lady (Martha Washington), is believed to have built Bride's Hill. Its deep cellar, lighted by oblong ground-level windows, houses a basement kitchen-dining room. On the main floor a broad central hall, with a graceful reverse-flight stairway rising to the low half-story above, separates two large rooms. Allegedly a separate brick kitchen structure once stood to the rear. When absorbed into the vast Joseph Wheeler estate in 1907, the house and surrounding farm became known as Sunnybrook. Located in rural Lawrence County, the house has been unoccupied since the 1980s and is in a state of disrepair."

= = = Supercilium = = =
"The supercilium is a plumage feature found on the heads of some bird species. It is a stripe which runs from the base of the bird's beak above its eye, finishing somewhere towards the rear of the bird's head. Also known as an ""eyebrow"", it is distinct from the eyestripe, which is a line which runs across the lores, and continues behind the eye. Where a stripe is present only above the lores, and does not continue behind the eye, it is called a supraloral stripe or simply supraloral. On most species which display a supercilium, it is paler than the adjacent feather tracts."
"The colour, shape or other features of the supercilium can be useful in bird identification. For example, the supercilium of the dusky warbler, an Old World warbler species, can be used to distinguish it from the very similar Radde's warbler. The dusky warbler's supercilium is sharply demarcated, whitish and narrow in front of the eye, becoming broader and more buffy towards the rear, whereas that of the Radde's warbler is diffusely defined, yellowish and broadest in front of the eye, becoming narrower and more whitish toward the rear. The supercilium of the northern waterthrush, a New World warbler, differs subtly from that of the closely related (and similarly plumaged) Louisiana waterthrush. The Louisiana has a bicoloured supercilium which widens significantly behind the eye, while the northern has an evenly buffy eyebrow which is either the same width throughout or slightly narrower behind the eye."
"A split supercilium divides above the lores. In some species, such as the jack snipe, the divided stripes reconnect again behind the eye. In others, such as the broad-billed sandpiper, the divided stripes remain separate."
"A supercilium drop is a feature found on some pipits; it is a pale spot on the rear of the which, although separated from the supercilium by an eyestripe, can appear at some angles to be a downward continuation of the supercilium."
= = = Adolf of Altena = = =
"Adolf of Altena, Adolf of Berg or Adolf of Cologne, (c. 1157 – 15 April 1220 in Neuss) was Archbishop of Cologne from 1193 to 1205."
Adolf was born about 1157 as the second son of Count Eberhard of Berg-Altena and his wife Adelheid von Arnsberg.
"About 1177 he became a canon in Cologne. Later, in 1183, he became Dean of the Cathedral, and in the year 1191 Cathedral Provost. After the abdication of his uncle Bruno III of Berg he became Archbishop of Cologne in 1193, as ""Adolf I"", or ""Adolf I von Altena""."
"In March 1194 he received his episcopal consecration by Hermann II of Katzenelnbogen, Prince-Bishop of Münster. In the same year Adolf was instrumental in arranging the release of King Richard I of England, whom he received with considerable solemnity in Cologne shortly afterwards, at the beginning of February 1194. He was a declared opponent of the plans for a hereditary empire of Emperor Henry VI and at Christmas 1195 refused Henry's wish for the election of his son Frederick Roger. He gave up his opposition in August 1197 for the secondary election of the candidate chosen in the meantime by the other Electors in Boppard. However, after the death of Henry VI, Adolf declared the election invalid, as the candidate was not baptised and the Emperor had put the Electors under pressure."
"In the ensuing dynastic struggle for the throne between the Hohenstaufen and the Welfs, he crowned on 12 July 1198 the Welf Otto of Brunswick in Aachen as King of the Romans (or German king). Shortly afterwards, Pope Innocent III, who had an interest in weakening the Hohenstaufen and in breaking their power (particularly in Italy), confirmed the election of Otto. On 6 January 1205 however Adolf then crowned the Staufen competitor for the crown, Philip of Swabia, as German king. Philip had already been crowned in 1198, although only in Mainz Cathedral, but he had nevertheless been crowned with the genuine Imperial Regalia and especially the Imperial crown."
"The Pope, who had reserved himself the king's question himself, was irritated by the rumor of the page change and asked Adolf himself for a report. Since Adolf did not want to sacrifice his just hard-won right of the decisive vote in the royal election, a papal presentation, he did not respond to the papal request. However, he overestimated its importance by far."
"On 19 July 1205 Adolf was excommunicated by Pope Innocent III and declared deposed. Already in July, a new archbishop was elected in Cologne. Since one was still in the Rhineland but still in the Hohenstaufen line, his successor could barely prevail against him, so that it came to a schism in the archbishopric of Cologne."
"In 1207 Adolf von Altena was in Rome, where he tried against his successor and fought for his reinstatement as archbishop - without success. Only the murder of Philip of Swabia (21 June 1208) and the changed political situation led to a submission to the pope and a recognition of his successor for himself and his followers, for which he received an annual pension of 250 marks. Adolf, from then until his death, was active in the archdiocese of Cologne as an auxiliary bishop. However his see was not returned to him."
"Dietrich I von Hengebach was deposed by the papal legate, and in March 1212 he was appointed to head the diocese. While initially holding this to be reinstated, he soon realized that it was just a provisional lead. In fact, the Archdiocese was again in the schism, especially since Adolf now argued with Dietrich von Hengebach before the Pope for reinstatement. The verdict was in 1216 and in Cologne it came again to the election of the bishop. The new archbishop became his successor as cathedral provost, Engelbert II of Berg. He was one of his relatives and had always supported him during the time of the schism, including by handing over goods from the cathedral chapter."
"Until his death, in 1220, Adolf was again active as auxiliary bishop in the archbishopric of Cologne. He died on 15 April 1220 in Neuss."

"August Thyssen (; Eschweiler, 17 May 1842 – Landsberg Castle, Ratingen, near Kettwig, 4 April 1926) was a German industrialist."
After he had completed his studies at the Politechnische Schule Karlsruhe and a commercial school at Antwerpen he like his brother Joseph Thyssen joined the bank of his father Friedrich Thyssen.
"In 1867 Thyssen and several members of his family founded the iron works ""Thyssen-Foussol & Co"" in Duisburg. When this company was dissolved in 1870, he used the new capital to establish with his father the ""Walzwerk Thyssen & Co"" that would become the base of an industrial empire in the industrialized Mülheim an der Ruhr, where the high of iron and steel prizes contributed to the making of his fortune. Initially he managed different companies separately in a decentralized fashion, but eventually he united them through a holding company. The largest company of his was the coal mining company ""Gewerkschaft Deutscher Kaiser"" in Hamborn (now part of Duisburg) that he had acquired in 1891."
"He built the first 500-ton blast furnace in Germany, the first 100-ton Martin furnace, and the first large tube (iron pipe size) works. Together with Hugo Stinnes Thyssen was a cofounder of RWE."
"On 3 December 1872 in Mülheim an der Ruhr he married Hedwig Pelzer (1854–1940), daughter of Johann-Heinrich Pelzer and wife Hedwig Troost. They divorced in 1885. The four children during the marriage were Fritz, August, Heinrich and Hedwig. To avoid the possibility that his divorce would lead to a partitioning of his industrial empire, Thyssen transferred the property to his children, but retained the management rights for himself during his lifetime."
"The Thyssen conglomerate became the nucleus of Vereinigte Stahlwerke AG, the biggest mining and steel cartel in the world, prior to World War II. Thyssen was refounded in 1953 and joined with KruppHoesch to become ThyssenKrupp AG in 1997."
"Thyssen purchased most of Beeckerwerth, including Haus Knipp, in the early 20th century."
"He was the first in his family to start acquiring a collection of works of art, including six pieces by his friend sculptor Auguste Rodin."
"Thyssen's firm was a vertically integrated company, controlling all aspects of the steelmaking process. He owned his own fleet of ships, a network of docks and a railroad. Although he was one of the richest men in Germany, to the day he died his ethos was ""If I rest, I rust."" He lived a simple life; he ran his empire from a dingy office in Mülheim, drove an old car, wore off-the-peg suits, and was known to drink and eat with his workers. He was also an ardent republican."
Thyssen died in 1926 of pneumonia following complications from eye surgery.

= = = Swaledale sheep = = =
"Swaledale is a breed of domestic sheep named after the Yorkshire valley of Swaledale in England. They are found throughout the more mountainous areas of Great Britain, but particularly in the Yorkshire Dales, County Durham, and around the pennine fells of Cumbria."
"Swaledales are noted for their off-white wool, curled horns and white around their nose and eyes. They are used for the production of lamb/mutton, the North of England Mule sheep, and as Pedigree breeding stock. Together with the Rough Fell, Herdwick, and Dalesbred sheep, they are one of the four variations associated with the English Lake District."
"Well suited to the exposed regions in which they predominantly live, the Swaledales are very hardy, thick coated, able bodied, and bold. The ewes make excellent mothers and are known for being able to rear lambs well, even in adverse conditions. They are of a medium build, with black faces marked with bright white around the nose and eyes, and both males and females grow curled horns, however the males horns are much larger. Their coats are thick and very coarse, and are considered a uniform white or off-white colour. The wool they produce, although durable, resilient and usable for a number of applications, is worth very little, with the British Wool Marketing Board paying approximately 40 pence per kilo of wool. The marketed fleece and fibre may contain kemp that is not white, so some yarns and prepared fibres from the Swaledale are grey. The sheep are also known for their tender and good-flavoured lamb and mutton."
"The Swaledales as a breed are related to Scottish Blackface and Rough Fell sheep, both of which are also predominant in upland locations in the United Kingdom and noted for their ability to thrive in exposed locations. Although the specific origins of the breed are unknown, a non-indigenous and exotic ancestor for the Swaledale was considered by two noted names of the eighteenth century, John Naismyth and Charles Findlater. Published in 1796, Naismyth's opinion in ""Young's Annals of Agriculture"" was that the origin of the black-faced highland breeds was ""impossible to trace"". Robert Trow-Smith in his book ""A History of British Livestock Husbandry, 1700–1900"" wrote: ""... it has already been suggested that this family stood outside the main stream of ancient British sheep..."" and that the root of the Swaledale and Scottish Blackface breeds could be the Argali. This tenuous link between domestic sheep and the wild Argali has since been proved to be insupportable due to a significant difference in genetic make-up and number of chromosomes."
"Before the Swaledale, Scottish Blackface, and Rough Fell emerged as distinct breeds, their 17th-century forerunner was the Linton. It was named after the West Linton market in Peeblesshire, which specialised in selling the hardy Lintons for Scottish Highland and other upland farming. At the beginning of the 18th century, the market is recorded as having sold upwards of 9,000 sheep in a single day, numbers which surely helped establish the breed firmly in upland areas."
"The Swaledale Sheep Breeders Association was founded in 1919 and originally consisted of farmers living within a seven-mile radius of the Tan Hill Inn, on the North Yorkshire moors. The association is an active organisation point for Swaledale sales, shows, breeding, and products."
"There are approximately 1,200 flocks of pedigree Swaledale sheep in the United Kingdom. Fine pedigree tups (rams) sell for approximately £2,000 to £5,000 on average, though the highest price paid at auction for a prized ram was £101,000. Being a hardy breed, farmers are able to rear their Swaledale flocks in remote and exposed locations, generally without needing to provide indoor accommodation."
"The sheep produce commercially viable mutton and wool. Swaledale mutton has good flavour and tenderness. Wool colour and coarseness prevents Swaledale wool from fetching high prices, but its strong and durable properties make it suitable for carpets, rugs, and insulation. However, the wool is also used for spinning and knitting of clothing, though on a lesser scale to its other uses."
"The Swaledale sheep is an official symbol of the Yorkshire Dales. In 2003, plans were submitted to build a Swaledale sheep visitor centre in Kirkby Stephen, Cumbria, declaring Kirkby Stephen as the ""spiritual home of the Swaledale sheep"". These plans drew strong opposition from the town of Hawes, in Yorkshire, a strong competitor in terms of Swaledale sales, and which had its own plans for a visitor centre."
"A control flock of Swaledales has been used to study and develop scrapie-resistant sheep. An infectious, persistent, and spontaneous disease, animals infected with scrapie must be quarantined and destroyed. The experimental breeding involved selecting a group of Swaledale sheep with low suspectability to the disease, injecting them with the agents of the disease, and breeding from the survivors. The research has concluded that the offspring of the infected sheep are more able to survive scrapie."
"A commercially successful breed, the North of England Mule, has been produced from the Swaledale ewes, by mating with Bluefaced Leicesters. The offspring of this cross are now one of the most prolific lowland sheep."
"Swaledale cheese is an award-winning cheese that is manufactured in the Swaledale area, though not exclusively from sheep of this breed."
"Garde Church (, sometimes also Garda Church) is a medieval church in Garde on the Swedish island of Gotland. Built in stages during the Middle Ages, it retains much of its medieval character. It contains medieval frescos, some of which were probably executed by artists from present-day Russia. It lies in the Diocese of Visby."
"The remains of an early stave church were discovered at the site of the presently visible church during an excavation in 1968. In the vicinity, Christian graves from the Viking Age have also been discovered, still containing the clothes of the deceased. A number of picture stones, pre-dating Christian times, have also been uncovered in the church, where they were used by the earliest builders as building material."
"The first stone church was begun in the 1130s, remains of which are still preserved in the nave of the church, including a few still usable, carved stone benches, and the base of the tower. The tower was heightened during the 13th century to its present altitude. The choir is the most recent part of the church. It is from the second quarter of the 14th century and replaced an earlier, Romanesque choir with an apse. The construction of the new choir was planned as the first step in a major rebuilding scheme; however for one reason or another, the builders seem to have run out of funds and the rest of the plans were never executed - hence the somewhat unusual shape of the church. A similar fate is not uncommon for churches on Gotland, as the region suffered an economic downturn at the end of the Middle Ages."
"The church retains much of the ambience of the earliest churches on Gotland: it is rather dark, the windows are small, the ceiling is flat and wooden, and the portals narrow."
"One of the most distinguishing features of the interior are a number of wall paintings or frescos. They depict two saints and were probably executed by a Russian artist (possibly from Staraja Ladoga) as they are Russo-Byzantine in style. The church also has a baptismal font made by the anonymous sculptor Byzantios sometime during the middle of the 12th century, and a triumphal cross made in the 13th century. The altarpiece is Baroque in style, and locally crafted."

= = = La Haine (drama) = = =
"La Haine ""(Hatred)"" is a drama in five acts and eight tableaux by Victorien Sardou, premiered at the Théâtre de la Gaîté in Paris on 3 December 1874. Jacques Offenbach, director of the theatre, composed extensive incidental music for chorus and orchestra to accompany the play."
"Offenbach had composed songs and incidental music for eleven classical and modern dramas for the Comédie Française in the early 1850s, gaining valuable experience in writing for the theatre. Sardou and Offenbach created their first joint work in 1872 with the opéra-bouffe-féerie ""Le Roi Carotte"", which ran for 195 performances, and this encouraged the two to renew their collaboration."
"By 1874, Jacques Offenbach had become the director of the Théâtre de la Gaîté. To follow a revival of ""Orphée aux Enfers"" on 7 February, he decided to mount Sardou's drame using the under-used theatrical troupe at the theatre."
"""Orphée aux Enfers"" closed on the 18 November to allow the rehearsals for ""La Haine"" to start, directed by Sardou himself who did not spare his efforts. ""Le Figaro"" reported that ""Sardou is the most meticulous director in the world"" and that he ""places particular importance on the extras being actively involved as much as any of the actors."" Rehearsals increased and the dress rehearsal took place on 27 November."
"The premiere was announced for the 29 November, but was postponed on the day itself, due to the flu epidemic in the capital which indisposed two principal actors, Lafontaine et Clément Just. First of all it was postponed until 30 November but only took place on Thursday 3 December, but as the actors had not completely recovered, Sardou cut the final scene."
"The premiere audience marvelled at the magnificence of the production. The scenery was especially dazzling. Francisque Sarcey noted ""It is only right to recognize that, of the décors, several are masterpieces of exquisite taste; the cathedral dome is a marvel of lightness and grave; the inside of the church is superb."""
"Everything was done to dazzle : dramatist and composer went so far as to transport a Cavaillé-Coll organ into the theatre. The settings were grand and impressive: the stage accommodated 535 persons.: ""The war-cries of the soldiers, the moans of the terrified women, the clanking of armour, the booming of guns, the conquerors' entrance in the city, the sacking of the palace, all was of an exact and admirable motion."""
"The words of Victorien Sardou were also noted, but critics commented that the direction was rather against the drama. Francisque Sarcey regretted that the principal roles appeared crushed : ""The supernumeraries and props are too prominent. The crowd is the principal character. Tableaux follow tableaux, and in this new work, they are equally dark."""
"For Auguste Vitu the play evoked painful memories of 1870 : ""Streets full of bodies, palaces in flames, the homeland forsaken in the presence of the dumbfounded foreigner, and as if scandalized by so many distractions, such are the unforgettable sights which our consciousness is still soured, and of which our hearts still bleed. The widows and orphans in black, I have seen them bowed in our churches, the air rent with their sobs. The door of deathly memory re-opens wide within us; and sadness envelops us with its great black wings."""
"While receipts came to around 8,000 francs per performance in mid-December, they fell to around 5,000 francs during the second fortnight On 28 December ""Le Figaro"" printed a letter from Sardou requesting that Offenbach recall his piece from the stage; Offenbach replied that as the public prefer lively art he would bring back ""Orphée"". The announcement had the effect of filling the theatre for the last performances of ""La Haine"". After 27 performances the play closed on 29 December 1874 and ""Orphée aux Enfers"" was brought back. The short run left the theatre in a parlous financial position. Some costumes were used in the revised version of ""Geneviève de Brabant"" which opened on 25 February 1875."
"Despite the failure, Sardou and Offenbach did contemplate a further collaboration on a spectacular production of the playwright's ""Don Quichotte""."
"A modern performance with reduced text but complete score took place on 19 July 2009 at the Festival de Radio France et Montpellier Languedoc Roussillon, with Fanny Ardant and Gérard Depardieu playing Cordelia and Orso. The concert was broadcast on France Musique on 30 July 2009."
Guelph chiefs
In 2006 the autograph orchestral score of the incidental music was found in the archive of the Offenbach family.
Some early sketches preserved in the Archives Historiques de la ville de Cologne were destroyed in an accident on 3 March 2009.
"Jean-Christophe Keck, responsible for the 2009 critical edition, commented that ""Offenbach composed a rich score of 30 numbers. The first sketches were noted down while travelling in his barouche where he had set up a work-table - the manuscripts bear witness to the jumping pen as it rode over Parisian cobbles. It consists of many mélodrames, off-stage choruses, interludes...""."
"During Offenbach's tour of the USA, he conducted with much success the Marche religieuse from ""La Haine"" for American audiences."
"Keck notes that just before he died, Offenbach recalled the opening of the overture to ""La Haine"" in the opening bars of the finale of the Venetian act from ""Contes d'Hoffmann""."
"The action takes place in Siena in 1369. Historically, the Republic of Siena has passed through much civil unrest and political upheavals at that period, and in general Siena tended to be Ghibelline, in opposition to Florence's Guelph position. The play's specific events and its main characters are, however, fictional."
"Sisenand (Spanish, Galician, and Portuguese: ""Sisenando""; ) ( 605 – 12 March 636) was a Visigothic King of Hispania, Septimania and Galicia from 631 to 636."
"Sisenand was the governor of Septimania, when the nobles revolted against the Visigothic king, Suintila, over the latter's confiscations of lands and distribution of privileges between the nobility and clergy. Sisenand joined the rebellion and overthrew Suintila with the aid of Dagobert I, King of the Franks, to whom Gothic nobles offered a plate of pure gold in return, weighing 500 pounds. The plate was allegedly a gift that Aetius, a Roman general, gave to Thorismund, then king of the Visigoths, in 451. After successfully overthrowing Suintila and capturing Zaragoza on 26 March 631, Sisenand proclaimed himself king. The victory of Sisenand also represented the triumph of the nobility over the common people, although the greatest beneficiary was the clergy, who took advantage of the weariness of the other contenders to enhance their own influence."
"Upon assuming the throne, he had Suintila, the previous king, declared a tyrant for his many crimes, iniquity, and accumulation of wealth at the expense of the poor; he also removed all taxes on the clergy."
"Between 632 and 633, there was apparently an attempted uprising within the kingdom, led by Iudila, only attested to by two coins from Mérida and Granada bearing the inscription IUDILA REX.. The revolution failed, and Iudila was later killed."
"In order to obtain ecclesiastical conformity, on 8 December 633, Sisenand convoked the IV Council of Toledo, which drew up civil and ecclesiastical laws within the Visigothic kingdom, including the death penalty, excommunication, and condemnation to perpetual perdition for those rebelling against the king. Similar penalties were approved for those who wished to dispense with such law of choice. However, the council did not concede any hereditary right to the king; the next king would be elected by the bishops and magnates from one of their own."
Sisenand died a natural death in the city of Toledo on 12 March 636. Chintila was chosen by the bishops to succeed him.
= = = Arrow (radio format) = = =
"Arrow is an American brand name radio format that plays classic rock from the 1970s through the 1990s. The format was popular in a number of markets in the 1990s and 2000s. The word ""Arrow"" is an extended acronym for ""All Rock and Roll Oldies""."
"Originally, the Arrow format focused on rock-oriented oldies music from the mid-1960s through the mid-1980s, excluding pop, bubblegum, disco, and doo-wop. It also kept disc jockey talk and jingles to a minimum."
"Many Arrow stations were owned by Infinity Broadcasting and located throughout the United States. The flagship and founding station for Arrow was KCBS-FM in Los Angeles which created and launched the format in September 1993. In 1996, the station adjusted to a broad-based classic rock format that lasted until its flip to adult hits as ""Jack FM"" in 2005. Outside Los Angeles, the Arrow format has been used on KRRW in Dallas—Fort Worth, KKRW in Houston, WARW in Washington, D.C., and KRSP-FM in Salt Lake City."
"In the Netherlands, Arrow Classic Rock airs a classic rock format similar to that in the United States. Launched in 1996, Arrow originally broadcast on various AM and later FM frequencies, moving exclusively to cable radio in 2009. Since 2004, the company that operates Arrow has also run a jazz station known as ""Arrow Jazz FM"" (now SubLime FM)."

"Who Cares a Lot? is the first compilation album from Faith No More, released on November 24, 1998. The album is a greatest hits retrospective that spans most of the band's career, including songs from all of the band's studio albums released under Slash Records."
"The first disc collects 15 singles from the band's Slash Records career in chronological order. It features the most recognized hits and promos. The second disc has a handful of unreleased songs, b-sides, demos, and live recordings, which were chosen by record label Slash rather than the band themselves. Some of the notable previously unreleased material includes ""The World Is Yours"" and ""I Won't Forget You""."
"There were three different versions that were put out for this compilation. Between the versions, the title and covers were altered. The single disc edition was tagged ""The Greatest Hits"", while the dual disc was labelled ""Greatest Hits""."
"The album art for the American release was the red question mark on black background, while the UK, European, Argentine, and Oceanian releases featured the Benny Hill art. The Oceanian double disc edition also had a ""Limited Edition 2CD Set"" sticker, as in other markets the bonus disc was not limited. In Europe only a single disc edition was released. For this, the first five tracks off the second disc were simply added to the end of the compilation."
"The album was originally called 'Who Cared a Lot?'. It had a different order of tracks and a different cover, but only saw release as a promo."
= = = Jukung = = =
"A jukung or kano, also known as cadik is a small wooden Indonesian outrigger canoe. It is a traditional fishing boat, but newer uses include ""Jukung Dives"", using the boat as a vehicle for small groups of SCUBA divers."
"The double outrigger jukung is but one of many types of Austronesian outrigger canoes that use the crab claw sail traditional throughout Polynesia. Whilst this sail presents some difficulties in tacking into the wind, actually requiring to jibe around, a jukung is superb in its reaching ability and jibe-safe running. They are usually highly decorated and bear a marlin-like prow."
"People in Kalimantan also named their boat Jukung. It is used for transport in daily activities such as going to the office, to school, or shopping in pasar terapung (The Floating Market, a very famous tourist attraction)."
"Currently there is a modern version of jukung made from High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) pipe in Indonesia. Advertised as unsinkable, the main body is made of a closed HDPE pipe that contains sealed air as the source of its buoyancy."
"In the late 1980s there was a seafaring journey of over 1000 nautical miles in open outrigger ‘jukung’ canoes by nine crews, who sailed from Bali to Darwin across the Timor Sea. Crews were from New Zealand, Australia, USA, England, Japan, France, Germany, The Netherlands and Indonesia. This was a three-month expedition masterminded by Bob Hobmann, filmed and made into a documentary called ""Passage out of Paradise""; it was featured by the National Geographic Society as ""The Great Jukung Race"". It was the first ever expedition of this kind, following purported austronesian sailing routes in craft dating 7,000 years old."
"The expedition started in Bali, where once crews were familiar with sailing their Jukungs they embarked on a two-month adventure following the ancient sailing routes (1,000 yrs BC), along the eastern Islands via Komodo Island. They completed the journey with a treacherous 5 day sail across the Arafura Sea to Darwin, via the Tiwi Islands."
"Challenges experienced were storms requiring numerous boat repairs, waterspouts, excessive exposure to sun, heat, or rain, adverse currents & whirlpools. Hazards included drifting onto war-torn Timor, unpredictable behaviour/welcome from remote villagers, salt water boils, wound infections, malnutrition, near misses with night-time freighters, sightings of sperm whales and giant white sharks. Some sailors were viciously attacked by hornets while preparing to leave a remote beach camp. The crews rebelled & unanimously decided to sail as a group, as opposed to racing the final leg of the journey, for safety."
"As a result, all sailors miraculously survived a cyclone >110 km/hr winds in their tiny (6 ft long, 50 cm wide) primitive bamboo/rope jukungs, although the Australian crew was lost for 2 days, located by the Australian coastguard, with a smashed jukung washed up on an island."
"Ourense Cathedral (Catedral de Ourense or Catedral do San Martiño) is a Roman Catholic church located in Ourense in northwestern Spain. Dedicated to St Martin, it was founded in 550. The first structure was restored by Alonso el Casto. The present mainly Gothic building was raised with the support of Bishop Lorenzo in 1220. Its local patroness is Saint Euphemia. There is a silver-plated shrine, and others of St Facundus and St Primitivus. The Christ's Chapel (Capilla del Cristo Crucificado) was added in 1567 by Bishop San Francisco Triccio. It contains an image of Christ, which was brought in 1330 from a small church on Cape Finisterre. John the Baptist's Chapel (Capilla de San Juan Bautista) was created in 1468 by the Conde de Benavente. The Portal of Paradise is sculptured and enriched with figures of angels and saints, while the antique cloisters were erected in 1204 by Bishop Ederonio. The Capilla de la Maria Madre was restored in 1722, and connected by the cloisters with the cathedral. The eight canons were called Cardenales, as at Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, and they alone did services before the altar; this custom was recognised as ""immemorial"" by Pope Innocent III, in 1209. The cathedral, which has undergone an impressive transition of architectural styles of Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Neoclassical, was built to a Latin Cross plan. It has been a functional basilica since 1887. The cathedral has a crucifix that is held in great reverence all over Galicia."
"The earliest cathedral in Ourense appears to have been the church dedicated to Santa María la Madre. In 550, the Suevian king Chararic built a second church dedicated to St Martin of Tours on the site of today's cathedral of the Auriense diocese. It was also the time when the arch bridge opposite the cathedral was built over the river, facilitating access to the thermal springs. The cathedral was however repeatedly destroyed over the centuries by the Moors and the Northmen who invaded the city. Today's building was constructed as a Romanesque church in the 12th and 13th centuries. Construction was supported by Bishop Lorenzo, who also built the new Ourense bridge and the bishop's palace."
Gothic additions followed until the early 16th century. There is little historical documentation on the construction of the building but there is a clear record mentioning the consecration of the high altar in 1188.
"The cathedral was classified as a national monument in June 1931. Since 1887, it has officially been designated a basilica."
"The cathedral plan takes the form of a Latin cross, the nave being flanked by slightly lower lateral aisles. It measures in length and across the transversal transept. Completed in 1505 by Rodrigo de Badajoz, the octagonal Gothic lantern tower with its three levels of windows rises above the point where the transept crosses the nave. The former apse was later converted into an ambulatory bordered by a series of chapels including the 15th-century St John's Chapel (Capilla de San Juan) and the 16th-century Chapel of Snows (Capilla de las Nieves). After the chancel had been demolished in the 20th century, the choir stalls were moved into the body of the church and into Christ's Chapel."
"The North Door (Portada Norte), initially of Romanesque design, has a variety of Gothic additions. The tympanum is crowned by a cross where Mary takes possession of Christ's body. Other decorations include an allusion to the miracle of St Martin who is depicted tearing his cloak in two as well as the figure of James the apostle (known as Santiago in Spanish). The turrets on either side of the entrance are no doubt the result of the need to protect the doorway which had been destroyed by Rodrigo Alonso Pimentel in 1471."
"To the right of the South Door (Portada Sur) which is topped by fine decorations, there is a 16th-century clock tower. The south façade was initially symmetrical with two defensive towers but the clock tower now looks less imposing. The east gable is flanked by the unfinished 16th-century Tower of St Martin and the 40-metre-tall bell tower which was repaired at the end of the 19th century as it had been damaged by the earthquake which hit Lisbon in 1755. The 16th-century rose window can still be seen."
"The Gothic influence can be clearly seen in the nave with its decorative arches and vaulted ceiling. Repairs and additions have also led to decorations in the Renaissance and Baroque styles in the chapels. The cathedral's main altarpiece in the flamboyant Gothic style is believed to be the work of Cornielles de Holanda with five vertical panels each divided into horizontal compartments. Martin of Tours is depicted in the central panel as the cathedral's patron saint while scenes from the life of Jesus and Mary can be seen in the other panels. On either side of the main altar, there are two other altars representing the martyred saints of Ourense: Facundus, Primitivus and Euphemia."
"Christ's Chapel (La capilla del Santo Cristo), to the right of the North Door, originally presented the figure of Christ rather than today's altar bearing Our Lady of the Pillar. The chapel owes its origin to Bishop Vasco Pérez Mariño who wished to be buried as close as possible to the figure of Christ. The chapel is decorated in flamboyant Baroque style with a Renaissance screen by Juan Bautista Celma and a canopy by Domingo de Andrade while other decorations are the work of Francisco de Castro Canseco. The Renaissance choir stalls which once stood in the cathedral's chancel were crafted by Diego de Solís and Juan de Angers. The chapel also contains many other offerings including 18th-century paintings with scenes of Christ's life and the evening meal at Emmaus."
"The 13th-century Portico of Paradise (Pórtico del Paraíso) was built by students of Master Mateo who is best known for his Pórtico de la Gloria in the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. Its three arches are supported by slender columns with a central mullion. The apostle St James or Santiago holds a sword reminiscent of his alleged miraculous participation in the legendary Battle of Clavijo. The original 13th-century figure was replaced in the 19th century. The statue of the Virgin of Consolation (Virgen del Consuelo) with the body of Christ which tops the mullion was also added in the 19th century. Other decorations include Christ being tempted by the devil, a medallion of God the Father and a tabernacle presenting St Martin tearing his cloak. The archivolts of the central arch bear the figures of the 24 elders from the Book of Revelation. The columns themselves are sculpted with apostles and prophets while the capitals present a variety of figures including Christ's temptations in the desert, centaurs fighting mermaids, dragons and harpies with frightening faces who were said to have brought the plague. The vividly coloured pilaster figures were restored in the 18th century from the original Romanesque polychrome. The two Baroque side chapels contain a Castro Canseco altarpiece of the Nursing Madonna and a representation of San Francisco Blanco from Ourense who was crucified in Japan in 1597."
"The cathedral was the burial place for several individuals from the 13th to the 15th centuries in chapels of evolving Gothic design. The tomb of Bishop Vasco Pérez Mariño (died 1342) is in the northern transept; Bishop Lorenzo (died mid-12th century) is entombed in the nave of the epistle; Don Alonso González del Padrón is entombed next to the St Luke's chapel; the tomb of the Infantina, who may have been a Castilian princess, is next to the Capilla de las Nieves; two bishops, including Bishop Quevedo, are also entombed on the wall of the epistle."
"The cathedral museum is accessed through the Romanesque door leading to the Gothic cloisters known as Claustra Nova. Artifacts include ""El Incunable de Monterrey"", the first book published in Galicia in 1494, Enrique de Arfe's processional cross, 13th-century enamels from Limoges, the so-called Treasure of San Rosendo and the oldest Christian tombstone in Galicia from Baños de Bande."

"He graduated from the U. S. Military Academy in 1854, was assigned to the 2nd artillery, and stationed at Newport, Rhode Island. In September 1854 he was made 2nd lieutenant and sent to Tampa, Florida, where he served in the Indian troubles for two years. He was compelled, in consequence of a severe fever, to return home on sick leave, but in the beginning of 1856 resumed his duties, acting part of the time as quartermaster and commissary until December 1856, when he was appointed acting assistant professor of geography, history, and ethics in the U.S. Military Academy, where he remained until September 24, 1860. He was promoted to 1st lieutenant on March 3, 1857."
"He was detailed for active duty at Fort Monroe in late 1860, and rendered efficient service in preventing its seizure. On May 26, 1861, he was sent to Newport News as master of ordnance, superintended the fortifications of that point, and trained the volunteers to artillery practice. When the expedition to Big Bethel was planned, he was unexpectedly detailed to accompany it with two guns, though in his own judgment it was ill-advised. When the Union Army troops were repelled, by his management of the guns he protected them from pursuit and destruction. Just at the close of the action, when he had given the orders to withdraw his guns from the field, he was struck by a rifle ball on the right temple and instantly killed. For his bravery in the two days' action, he was brevetted captain, major, and lieutenant colonel, on the day of his death. First Buried in Philadelphia's Woodland Cemetery he was later reburied in West Laurel Hill Cemetery, Bala Cynwyd, Montgomery County Pennsylvania"

She was previously the Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS London. Her term of office ended 31 October 2018."
"Saunders was born on 14 February 1961 in Aberdeen, Scotland to Hugh Colin Brown and Margaret Bennett Brown. She attended primary school in Brixton, London and St Teilo's Church in Wales High School in Cardiff. Saunders then studied at Runshaw College in Leyland, Lancashire. She read law at the University of Leeds from 1979 to 1982. She graduated Bachelor of Laws (LLB hons)."
"Having completed her pupillage and thereby becoming a qualified barrister, Saunders began working for Lloyd's of London. She joined the newly formed CPS in 1986. In 1991, she joined the CPS policy division. She was appointed Branch Crown Prosecutor for Wood Green in 1997, and Assistant Chief Crown Prosecutor of CPS London South in 1999. She took up the appointment of Chief Crown Prosecutor for Sussex in 2001 overseeing the case made against Roy Whiting, who was convicted of murdering Sarah Payne. Between 2003 and 2005, she served as Deputy Legal Advisor to the Attorney General. She then became head of prosecutions for the Organised Crime division of the CPS. She was the Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS London from 2009 until 2013. During that time, she was involved in the 2011 to 2012 retrial, and subsequent conviction, of the killers of Stephen Lawrence."
"On 23 July 2013, it was announced that she would become the new Director of Public Prosecutions in succession to Sir Keir Starmer, taking up the appointment on 1 November 2013. She was the first head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to be appointed from within the service and the second woman to hold the appointment."
"As the Director of Public Prosecutions, Saunders has faced criticism and controversy around the handling of trials for rape and sexual assault. The CPS has been criticised for the case of Eleanor de Freitas, who killed herself after the CPS decided to take over a private prosecution brought against her by the man she accused of rape. Saunders said that the ""evidence in this case was strong and having considered it in light of all of our knowledge and guidance on prosecuting sexual offences and allegedly false rape claims, it is clear there was sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction for perverting the course of justice"". Saunders has also stated that the number of rape prosecutions being brought to court will increase by a third in the year 2015 and has argued that this increase follows improvements in the treatment received by victims by police, courts and the CPS."
"In 2014, Saunders announced the CPS would be seeking to fight against criminals hiding assets abroad and appointed a team of six specialist lawyers to work with legal authorities overseas to recover assets from countries including Spain and the United Arab Emirates."
"In April 2015, Saunders was criticized for her decision not to prosecute Greville Janner on child sexual abuse charges despite his meeting the evidential test for prosecution, citing his poor health, as well as for dropping charges against nine journalists as part of the Operation Elveden case. Saunders defended herself saying, ""I’m not here to make popular decisions. I always feel under pressure to make the right decision."" In June 2015, ""The Guardian"" reported that, following a review, the decision not to prosecute Lord Janner would in fact be overturned. Simon Danczuk, then MP for Rochdale, told the Guardian that ""if the report is accurate, Saunders will now have to consider her position"" as a result of the scrutiny that her initial decision would now be placed under. The decision marks the first time a DPP has had a major prosecuting decision reviewed and overturned. Amid calls for her resignation, she told the BBC that she would not resign. Saunders blamed failings within her department and the police for the collapse of three different police inquiries between 1991 and 2007. Theresa May (then the home secretary, later Prime Minister) said in a radio interview: “I was very concerned when I heard about this decision. It is not my decision, it is entirely a decision for the director of public prosecutions.”"
"In 2015, a case was brought against Saunders in the High Court. The Plaintiff, Nikki Kenward, argued that Saunders had amended prosecution policy outside of the democratic process. Saunders released the alleged amendment in October, 2014. In it she suggested that the guidelines on assisted suicide prosecution be understood such that a doctor who is not the patient's immediate care provider, should not be as likely to face prosecution as a doctor who is the patient's immediate care provider. This prompted a backlash from anti-assisted suicide groups who argued that this was a substantial change, which would allow for businesses similar to Dignitas to operate in the UK. Saunders' defence was that she had only clarified the existing guidelines. Nevertheless, Kenward was granted the judicial review against Saunders in April, 2015. It went to the High Court in November, 2015 where the case against Saunders was dismissed."
"As of 2018, Saunders was paid a salary of between £210,000 and £214,999."
"On 2 April 2018, it was announced that Saunders was to stand down at the end of her term as head of the CPS and on 1 November 2018 she was succeeded as Director of Public Prosecutions by Max Hill QC."
"In June 2015, Saunders was accused by journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer of a crusade to criminalise ""drunken sexual encounters"". In December 2017, ""The Daily Telegraph"" journalist Allison Pearson called for Saunders to resign following the scandal of several high-profile rape cases falling apart or convictions being overturned due to police withholding key information regarding the innocence of the accused."
"On 23 January 2018, however, Saunders was criticised by victims and survivors' groups because her words could be taken to mean that silence equates to consent."
"After it was announced that Saunders would not be reappointed for a second term, ""The Daily Telegraph"" also reported in April, 2018 that crime statistics tracking burglary, violent crime and shoplifting all rose significantly under Saunders' tenure ever since she first became Director of Public Prosecutions."
"On 29 December 2018 ""The Telegraph"" reported that Alison Saunders will be ""the first former head of the Crown Prosecution Service not to receive a senior honour after her tenure was marked by a series of scandals"". (All of her predecessors ""became a knight or a dame either during their tenure, or immediately after their departure."") A week after she stepped down as head of the CPS, it was announced that the CPS had agreed to a five-figure settlement with broadcaster Paul Gambaccini, who was arrested as part of Operation Yewtree and bailed repeatedly for a year over unfounded sex charges before being told he would not be charged. Samuel Armstrong, a former Conservative MP's chief of staff who was acquitted of rape, said the settlement was a ""damning indictment"" that ""should act as the final nail in the coffin for her hopes of a damehood."" He added: ""Saunders' one-woman crusade to shift the scales of justice in sex cases not only ruined the lives of dozens of young men but of Paul Gambaccini as well."""
In 2019 Saunders joined the law firm Linklaters as Dispute Resolution Partner.
"Saunders is married to Neil Saunders, a lawyer, and has two sons."
"Saunders was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 2013 New Year Honours ""for services to Law and Order especially after the 2011 London Riots"" and Dame Commander of the Order of the Bath (DCB) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to criminal justice."

"The Prophecies of Nostradamus is a 1979 television film based on the writings of Nostradamus. It was also known as ""The Man Who Saw Tomorrow""."
"Virginia City is a 1940 American Western film directed by Michael Curtiz and starring Errol Flynn, Miriam Hopkins, Randolph Scott, and a mustachioed Humphrey Bogart in the role of the real-life outlaw John Murrell. Based on a screenplay by Robert Buckner, the film is about a Union officer who escapes from a Confederate prison and is sent to Virginia City from where his former prison commander is planning to send five million dollars in gold to Virginia to save the Confederacy. The film premiered in its namesake, Virginia City, Nevada. The film was shot in black and white (sepiatone)."
"Union officer Kerry Bradford (Errol Flynn) stages a daring escape from Confederate Libby Prison run by the commandant, Vance Irby (Randolph Scott). Bradford reports to Union headquarters and is immediately sent to Virginia City, a Nevada mining town, to find out where $5,000,000 in gold that Southern sympathizers plan to ship to the tottering Confederacy is being kept. On the westbound stagecoach, he meets and falls in love with the elegant Julia Hayne (Miriam Hopkins), who unbeknownst to him is in fact a dance-hall entertainer — and a rebel spy, sent by Jefferson Davis (Charles Middleton) to assist in the transfer of the gold by wagon train. Also on the stagecoach is the legendary John Murrell (Humphrey Bogart), leader of a gang of ""banditos"", traveling as a gun salesman. Before he and his gang can rob the stage, Bradford gets the drop on Murrell, who is forced to send his men away."
"When the stage reaches Virginia City, Julia gives Bradford the slip and heads off to warn Captain Irby, who is now managing the gold-smuggling operation, that Bradford is in town. Bradford follows Irby to the rebels' hideout behind a false wall in a blacksmith's shop, but the gold is moved before he arrives. The Union garrison is called out to patrol the roads to prevent any wagons from leaving town."
"While Irby is meeting with the sympathetic town doctor, Murrell shows up looking for someone to set his broken arm. Irby offers Murrell $10,000 to have his banditos attack the garrison, which will force the Union soldiers guarding the roads to come to its defense. While the soldiers are busy, Irby's rebels will smuggle the gold out in the false bottoms of their wagons. First Irby needs to take care of Bradford. He uses Julia to arrange a meeting between the two men, and then takes Bradford prisoner, intending to return him to prison."
"The rebels' caravan is stopped at a small Union outpost. At first, they are allowed to proceed, but after watching the bullion-laden wagons have difficulty moving through the soft dirt, the soldiers become suspicious and attempt to inspect the wagons. The Southerners start a firefight, killing the soldiers. In the confusion, Bradford escapes. Pursued closely by Irby and his men, he rides his horse down a steep incline and ends up somersaulting down the hill. The rebels, believing him dead, continue toward Texas. Bradford returns to the outpost and sends a telegraph to the garrison. Major Drewery (Douglass Dumbrille), the garrison commander, arrives with a contingent of cavalry. Drewery, who is scornful of Bradford as a soldier, does not take his advice and ends up following a false trail, causing the pursuit to fall ever further behind the rebels, who are themselves fighting thirst, privation, and the unforgiving terrain. Bradford is able to persuade Drewery to allow him to take a small detachment to follow his hunch."
"Bradford and his men catch up with the caravan which is trapped in a canyon and being attacked by Murrell's banditos who are attempting to take the gold. Irby is wounded in the gunfight, but Bradford's superior military skills and the rebels' long guns eventually drive off the banditos. Before he dies, Irby delegates command of the caravan and its gold to Bradford. During the night, knowing that in the morning both Murrell's men and Drewery's command will arrive, Bradford takes the gold from the wagons and buries it in the canyon to prevent its capture."
"Drewery and his men arrive in the morning in time to crush the outlaws' renewed attack, and Murell is killed. Bradford refuses to disclose the gold's location and is brought up on charges in a court-martial. He defends his action in that, ""as a soldier"", he knew the gold might have been used to win the war for the South and prevented that, but ""as a man"" he knows it belongs to the South and he would prefer that it be used to rebuild the South's shattered economy and wounded pride after the war. The court finds him guilty of high treason and sentences him to death on April 9, 1865."
"The day before Bradford's scheduled execution, Julia meets with Abraham Lincoln (Victor Kilian, seen only in silhouette) and pleads for Bradford's life. Lincoln reveals that at that very moment, Generals Lee and Grant are meeting at Appomattox Courthouse to end the war. As the war is over, and in a symbol of the reconciliation between North and South, Lincoln pardons Bradford in the spirit of his second inaugural address, ""With malice toward none; with charity for all..."""
"The film was a follow up to ""Dodge City"" although it has entirely new characters and was not a sequel, predating it by eight years in historical time. It was originally called ""Nevada"" and was to star basically the same director and cast as ""Dodge City"": Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Ann Sheridan, Donald Crisp, Guinn Williams, and Alan Hale. The title was eventually changed to ""Virginia City"", which had been owned by RKO, but they agreed to give it to Warners."
"De Havilland dropped out and was replaced by Brenda Marshall. However, within a few weeks, Miriam Hopkins replaced her. Randolph Scott was hired to play Flynn's antagonist. Victor Jory was going to play the main villain, but had a scheduling conflict due to his appearance in ""Light of Western Stars"". He was replaced by Humphrey Bogart, requiring ""It All Came True"" to be pushed back."
"There was six weeks' filming based in Flagstaff, Arizona."
The film was given a gala premiere in Reno and Virginia City.
"Frank Nugent of ""The New York Times"", despite criticizing the acting talents of Flynn and Hopkins, wrote that ""there is enough concentrated action in [""Virginia City""], enough of the old-time Western sweep, to make it lively entertainment""."
"""Filmink"" magazine called it ""a big, expensive, noisy movie which aims for size and spectacle over, say, suspense and thrills – I don’t think director Michael Curtiz was any more excited by Westerns than Flynn, but both do professional jobs, as does Scott."""
"According to Warner Bros records, the film earned $1,518,000 domestically and $602,000 foreign."
"When the film was released in France in 1947, it became one of the most popular movies of the year."
= = = Irving Vendig = = =
"Irving Vendig (October 11, 1902 — January 7, 1995) was an American soap opera writer best known for creating ""The Edge of Night""."
"Born in the Mississippi city of Holly Springs, Vendig created ""The Edge of Night"" for Procter and Gamble Productions and CBS Daytime in 1956. He had been a writer on the ""Perry Mason"" radio show and when Erle Stanley Gardner refused to allow the show to become a soap opera, Vendig refashioned the show into ""The Edge of Night"", and brought actor John Larkin, who played Mason on the radio, to the show as series star Mike Karr. The character of Mike's daughter, Laurie Ann Karr, was named for Vendig's daughter Laurie Ann."
"Vendig was the series' head writer from 1956 until 1960, then co-head writer with James Gentile from 1960 until 1965. Vendig was credited on-air as series' creator until his departure from the daytime drama in 1965."
"He also created the NBC Daytime drama ""Three Steps to Heaven"". He also wrote for the daytime dramas ""Search for Tomorrow"" (which he wasn't able to see at his Florida home because the local CBS affiliate didn't carry it), ""Paradise Bay"" and ""The Clear Horizon"". He created ""Hidden Faces"", a short-lived drama for NBC, which was similar in theme to his more famous ""The Edge of Night"", which starred Stephen Joyce, Conard Fowkes, Louise Shaffer, Tony Lo Bianco and future Oscar nominee Linda Blair."
= = = Variable capacitor = = =
"A variable capacitor is a capacitor whose capacitance may be intentionally and repeatedly changed mechanically or electronically. Variable capacitors are often used in L/C circuits to set the resonance frequency, e.g. to tune a radio (therefore it is sometimes called a tuning capacitor or tuning condenser), or as a variable reactance, e.g. for impedance matching in antenna tuners."
"In mechanically controlled variable capacitors, the distance between the plates, or the amount of plate surface area which overlaps, can be changed."
"The most common form arranges a group of semicircular metal plates on a rotary axis (""rotor"") that are positioned in the gaps between a set of stationary plates (""stator"") so that the area of overlap can be changed by rotating the axis. Air or plastic foils can be used as dielectric material."
"By choosing the shape of the rotary plates, various functions of capacitance vs. angle can be created, e.g. to obtain a linear frequency scale. Various forms of reduction gear mechanisms are often used to achieve finer tuning control, i.e. to spread the variation of capacity over a larger angle, often several turns."
"A vacuum variable capacitor uses a set of plates made from concentric cylinders that can be slid in or out of an opposing set of cylinders (sleeve and plunger). These plates are then sealed inside of a non-conductive envelope such as glass or ceramic and placed under a high vacuum. The movable part (plunger) is mounted on a flexible metal membrane that seals and maintains the vacuum. A screw shaft is attached to the plunger, when the shaft is turned the plunger moves in or out of the sleeve and the value of the capacitor changes. The vacuum not only increases the working voltage and current handling capacity of the capacitor, it also greatly reduces the chance of arcing across the plates. The most common usage for vacuum variables are in high-powered transmitters such as those used for broadcasting, military and amateur radio, as well as high-powered RF tuning networks. Vacuum variables can also be more convenient; since the elements are under a vacuum, the working voltage can be higher than an air variable the same size, allowing the size of the vacuum capacitor to be reduced."
"Allen Gamble and Terry ""Yankee Clipper"" Hoitz are both detectives of the New York City Police Department (NYPD). Allen is a mild-mannered forensic accountant while Terry is a hot-tempered detective who has been partnered with Allen ever since he mistakenly shot Derek Jeter during the World Series. They receive no respect from the other officers, particularly detectives Martin and Fosse. All but Terry idolize cocky detectives Chris Danson and P. K. Highsmith, who are considered New York City's best policemen even though they frequently cause millions of dollars in property damage catching petty criminals. During a pursuit, Danson and Highsmith leap to their deaths after attempting to ""aim for the bushes"", which causes the precinct to wonder why they did it and who will take their place."
Allen and Terry investigate a scaffolding permit violation by multi-billionaire Sir David Ershon but wind up uncovering a much bigger plot by Ershon to cover the losses incurred by his client Lendl Global. Lendl CEO Pamela Boardman has hired a team of mercenaries led by Roger Wesley to make sure Ershon pays her back.
"During their investigation, Allen confides in Terry about how he ran a college dating service in his past, though he denies that he was ever a pimp. When they both get to Allen's house, Terry develops a slight crush on Allen's wife Sheila, while not believing she is truly with Allen because of her beauty. When they visit Allen's ex-girlfriend, Christinith, to gain their police evidence, she and her husband wants him to have sex with her. When Sheila tells Allen that she is pregnant, he reverts to his dark personality, which has her kick him out of their house. Meanwhile, Terry unsuccessfully attempts to reconnect with his ex-fiancée Francine, who had walked out on him due to his furious attitude."
"Their investigation comes to a halt when Ershon's attorney, Don Beaman, learns of Ershon's plan to cover his losses, leading Wesley to kill him and make it look like a suicide. Angered at their lack of progress, Capt. Gene Mauch splits up Allen and Terry, sending Terry to traffic duty and Allen to beat patrol. Despite Terry's anger, Allen still works the case on his own. After Allen learns that Danson and Highsmith died investigating a staged theft during which Wesley broke into an accounting firm next door, he finds credible evidence and earns his gun back from Mauch. Allen then convinces Terry to rejoin him. They meet Capt. Mauch at Bed Bath & Beyond, his second job, where the police captain admits he has been holding off on the case because Ershon has high-profile connections that could ruin him, and he allows them to finish the case off-the-books."
"They go to an investment meeting Ershon is having and realize that the $32 billion Ershon seeks is really coming from the NYPD pension fund. They escape with Ershon to his private apartment, and Ershon tells them that the money for the pension fund is already in his account, ready to be transferred. Later that night, Allen and Terry finally reconcile with their loved ones. Allen apologizes to Sheila with her mother as a secret communication system and so she welcomes her husband back in. Terry also apologizes to Francine for letting his anger rule his life."
"The next morning, they drive to the bank to stop the transfer, evading Wesley's team, groups of Chechen and Nigerian investors to whom Ershon owes money, and police officers who are told Allen and Terry have gone rogue. They reach the bank and halt the transfer. Wesley arrives, and as a delaying tactic, shoots both officers and Ershon in their arms. Mauch finally arrives with police backup, rescuing the two and arresting Ershon for his embezzlement, and Wesley for multiple counts of murder. Ershon's arrest leads to a stock market crash and the subsequent federal bailout of Lendl Global. Terry marries Francine, and Allen reunites with his wife. The narrator finishes off by stating that the true heroes are the everyday people who work to make a difference, not the ones who appear in the newspaper or on TV."
"McKay described the genesis as an ""accident, in a way"", stemming from a dinner he and Ferrell had with Wahlberg. After noticing the actors' chemistry, McKay wrote producer Kevin Messick an email hypothesizing a possible film starring the two, giving a cop film as an example of what he thought would work. Messik suggested developing that idea into a film."

"""Birds of the West Indies"" was a book owned by novelist Ian Fleming, who used the ornithologist's name for his own fictional British secret agent character, Commander James Bond. Fleming, a keen bird watcher while living at his estate in Jamaica, owned this book. He later explained that the author's name was ""brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon, and yet very masculine – just what I needed."" Fleming once said in a ""Reader's Digest"" interview: ""I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, and 'James Bond' was much better than something more interesting, like 'Peregrine Carruthers.'

Large format lenses are photographic optics that provide an image circle large enough to cover large format film or plates. Large format lenses are typically used in large format cameras and view cameras.
Photographic optics generally project a circular image behind the lens. On smaller format cameras the image circle generally covers only the intended film size with little room to spare. Large format lenses are an exception. For large format use the circular patch of image light usually extends beyond the minimum size circle needed to fully cover the rectangle of the film. The extra image offers room to spare to make use of camera movements that re-align the lens away from dead center on the film.
"Lenses of the same general construction are often given a name implying this design. For example, a Tessar always has four elements in three groups as described below, although Tessars have been produced with different focal lengths and maximum apertures for many decades. Sometimes a name does not identify a specific design; Kodak's Ektar lens brand name encompasses many different types. Sometimes different manufacturers use different names for lenses of the same type; for example the Voigtländer Skopar is of Tessar design. And sometimes identical lenses are sold under different names and at different prices; for example, lenses branded as Rodenstock and Caltar."

= = = Lockdown (Stargate SG-1) = = =
"""Lockdown"" is the third episode for season eight of the Canadian-American military science fiction television series ""Stargate SG-1"". The episode was written by Joseph Mallozzi and Paul Mullie, and directed by Will Waring. This was the only episode in the eighth season to receive a syndication rating, but was also one of the lowest rated of the season on the Nielsen household ratings. The episode got strong reviews from major media publishers worldwide."
"""Lockdown"" is about the discovery of an outbreak of disease which first occurred in the Russian Federation, but later on infects personnel of Stargate Command. The outbreak is later revealed to be the ethereal remains of Anubis. At the same time, Jack O'Neill stops the recruiting process for SG-1 leaving Samantha Carter as the new leader of SG-1 throughout season 8. Anubis tries to take new hosts but is eventually defeated and forced to a destination chosen by Carter, a frozen, barren planet."
"Several months after the destruction of Anubis' fleet, Stargate Command gets a new member in the form of Russian Air Force Colonel Alexi Vaselov (Russian: Алексей Вaсильев) who promptly asks General O'Neill for a place in SG-1. After the general rejects this request, Daniel talks to Vaselov about it, but the colonel suddenly collapses. When he wakes up again, he doesn't remember anything since he was in Russia, and his body shows signs of extensive viral damage. Gen O'Neill is concerned that there may be a contagion on the base, and orders Daniel to the infirmary just as he is about to leave on a mission with SG-11. Daniel suddenly pulls out his gun and injures several people, yelling for the gate to be opened, before he is stopped by O'Neill and Teal'c. O'Neill orders for no one to enter or leave the base to avoid spreading possible disease."
"Meanwhile, Vaselov begins to remember what happened—that he felt like being trapped in his own body—and he blames himself for what has happened. It is also discovered that a Russian cosmonaut from the International Space Station died a week after returning to Russia, exhibiting the same symptoms as Vaselov, and that Vaselov was with him when he died. Later, Daniel wakes up and quickly remembers that he was taken over by Anubis. It turns out that the former System Lord, thanks to his half-ascended form as a dark specter, can easily travel between hosts. He got into the cosmonaut's body from space debris, and is moving from person to person to get to the stargate. The members of SGC conclude that Anubis plans to leave through the stargate rather than use his ascended powers, since that would draw attention from the Ancients. However, he needs a body in order to get through the stargate. In the meantime, Anubis is easily eluding capture, so the SGC must execute a bold plan to stop him."
"This plan involves splitting the base into three zones. Power to the stargate is shut off, and is only accessible from Zone 1. The gate itself, and its surrounding areas, is in Zone 2. Hallways between the zones and into the gateroom are blocked using drop-down steel doors, and these can only be opened from Zone 3. All staff are restricted to one section only—no movement between sections is allowed."
"However, Anubis takes over Carter (who is in the section controlling the ""lockdown""), and makes her schedule a program to open the doors temporarily. She goes into the new control room and begins dialing the gate. O'Neill tries to stop her. With no other options, Jack and Major Kearney trigger the self-destruct, only for Jack to zat Kearney, revealing that Anubis is now possessing Jack's body. With the Stargate now active, Anubis now controlling Jack attempts to walk through the Stargate but Carter gets to the control room and ends the self-destruct sequence. She doesn't, however, manage to stop the gate from dialing, and it activates. Just as O'Neill is about to step through the gate, Col Vaselov, who has escaped from the infirmary, stops him. He holds O'Neill/Anubis at gunpoint and tells the Goa'uld to take his body instead. Anubis accepts, and steps through the stargate in Vaselov's body."
"Afterwards, Carter reveals that Anubis did not actually escape, as she did manage to override the dialing process to send him to an alternate address. The planet she chose to send him to was extremely cold, so Vaselov's body froze, leaving Anubis unable to dial a new address."
"Aaron Pearl who portrayed Major Kearney in the episode, previously played the younger version of George Hammond in the season two episode ""1969"". ""Lockdown"" was the first shot episode for season eight, but became the third to air so that they could continue the cliffhanger after previous season episode, ""Lost City"". Writer Joseph Mallozzi wanted to have an episode centered around the Jack O'Neill new job in Stargate Command, to ""Test him early"" on ""as the new [...] commander."""
"In the first script draft, Anubis was set to appear in a fiery planet at the end of the episode, but when the script was finished he ended up in a frozen planet. Mallozzi when commenting on the episode, said it was an ""Image I'd been dying to use"". When Samantha Carter told Jack O'Neill in the original draft where she had sent Anubis, O'Neill responded ""Well, I hope he wore his warm socks."" The line was dropped since producers felt it was ""too callous"" for the character. One of the early scenes featuring Alexi Vaselov, where he awakens to find Teal'c in the observation room, was originally scripted to take place in the infirmary. Originally Teal'c was set to appear at Daniel Jackson's bedsite with Vaselov engaging in the conversation."
"""Lockdown"" received 2.0 in Nielsen household rating and 1.7 in syndication ratings becoming the only episode in season eight to receive a syndication rating. The episode debuted on the Sci Fi Channel in the United States on July 23, 2004, with ""Stargate Atlantis"" episode ""Hide and Seek"". It was the top-rated show on the Sci Fi Channel that week. ""Lockdown"" drew close to 2.7 million viewers in the United States, this was down four-tenths from the previous episode ""New Order"". While the viewership was higher than the previous season which averaged a 1.8 in Nielsen household ratings, ""Lockdown"""
"was surpassed by sister show ""Stargate Atlantis"" episode ""Hide and Seek"" in ratings and viewership. The episode was noted as the first ""Stargate SG-1"" episode which was not the top-rated show on the Sci Fi Channel in the week in two years."
= = = Zero Hour (Stargate SG-1) = = =
"""Zero Hour"" is the fourth episode from Season 8 of the military science fiction television series ""Stargate SG-1"". It was written by producer Robert C. Cooper and directed by Peter Woeste. Clips of the episode were shown on ""Late Night with Conan O'Brien"" before Season 8 began, with ""Late Night"" graphic designer Pierre Bernard making a cameo appearance in the episode. The first airing of ""Zero Hour"" on July 30, 2004 on the American Sci Fi Channel was viewed by 3 million people. The episode received mixed reviews."
"""Zero Hour"" takes place shortly after the promotion of main character Jack O'Neill from Colonel to Brigadier General. With O'Neill being the new leader of Stargate Command (SGC), Lt. Col. Samantha Carter has assumed O'Neill's old position as leader of the SG-1 unit. The idea to have the episode focus on General O'Neill solving various problems at his new job came from the writers' wondering what the general of the SGC does while his teams are on missions."
"The episode takes place over the course of five days, counting down to an at first unrevealed event named ""Zero Hour"". Five days to Zero Hour, General O'Neill is introduced to his new administrative aide, Mark Gilmor, who makes a suspicious phone call. Meanwhile, O'Neill's new position as a general is twofold. He needs to decide decorations for an upcoming official visit, and prepare SG-1 for its next offworld trip. A quickly growing alien plant and the arrival of two brawly Amrans, possible trade partners from another world, lead O'Neill to write a letter to General Hammond, his predecessor."
"At four days to Zero Hour, the alien plant has grown to cover many areas of the base. After SG-1 go missing on their off-world mission, a Goa'uld named Ba'al contacts Stargate Command and suggests an exchange of the captured SG-1 against Camulus, another Goa'uld who requested asylum on Earth several episodes before. With the help of Camulus, a potent power source is found and brought back to Stargate Command, only to find it tainted by Camulus (powering it up could result in the destruction of the Solar system). With the SGC suffering from a temporary electricity failure caused by the alien plants, Ba'al's renewed contacting only results in O'Neill's mocking. Exhausted by sleep deprivation two days to Zero Hour, O'Neill finishes his letter to General Hammond to inform him of his resignation."
"Although Camulus leaves Earth, Ba'al does not send back SG-1. When all SG teams announce their trust and support for the general, SG-1 dial the Stargate from offworld, revealing that they were never captured by Ba'al but instead were trapped in a secret base. After their safe return, O'Neill attests new SG-1 leader Samantha Carter's positive leadership skills. It is revealed that the ZPM Camulus was given to supposedly kill Ba'al (which Ba'al would use to destroy Earth) was actually the dead one from Antarctica. Zero Hour makes up the last minutes of the episode. The President is about to arrive, and Gilmor announces that his special assignment, initiated by the President's order, will end the next day. Gilmor expresses his respect, and as they leave to greet the President, the camera zooms in on the resignation letter on O'Neill's desk, with the last words, ""Never mind""."
"Despite being fourth in the airing order, ""Zero Hour"" was filmed as the seventh out of the twenty episodes of Season 8. The limited availability of Richard Dean Anderson (Jack O'Neill), who only worked 3.5 days out of five working days a week during the eighth season, extended the seven-day filming period to four weeks. With ""Zero Hour"" being a bottle episode to save money, director Peter Woeste filmed the majority of the episode on the standing SGC sets at The Bridge Studios, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The labs of Dr. Lee and Carter were filmed in the same room of the standing set, and a storage room for filming equipment was remodeled into the office of Gilmor. Second unit director Andy Mikita was responsible for the off-world scenes of the SG teams, filmed in Tynehead Park, one of the few undeveloped Vancouver locations that still allows filming. O'Neill in his sleeping quarters was the episode's last filmed scene, shot in two takes to allow Anderson to catch his flight home to Los Angeles."
"The inspiration for the episode came from the ""SG-1"" writers wondering for years what George Hammond, the SGC leader from seasons one through seven, does while SG-1 is away on missions. Imagined scenarios ranged from the general dealing with minor decisions like bunting and lunch buffet, to averting major emergencies and threats. The episode's working title was ""A Day in the Life of General O'Neill"", but writer Robert C. Cooper felt ""Zero Hour"" was more appropriate, referring to the President's visit at the end of the episode. The subplot of the SGC being overrun with plant life originates in a Season 4 idea by writer and producer Brad Wright. To not interrupt the shooting process, the set was decorated with various plants and vines overnight. Some plants were plastic, but real plants were used for the torching scenes, sprayed to be flame retardant so as not to burn the whole set. Jim Menard as the director of photography was responsible for the green lighting when the emergency lighting goes off. He achieved depth by using differently-colored lights in the control room and near the gate."
"""Zero Hour"" features several guest stars. Los Angeles actor David Kaufman was brought in to play the part of Mark Gilmor, a red herring to the story. Cliff Simon, flown in from L.A. for a day's work, filmed most of his scenes as Ba'al against green-screen in the gateroom for a ""hologram feel"". Bill Dow (Dr. Lee) was doing theater work in Vancouver during the filming of this episode, necessitating the producers to schedule around his availability. Gary Jones's character, an ""SG-1"" semi-regular technician who sported the name ""Norman Davis"" on his uniform for years, received a new name in this episode: ""Walter Harriman"". After O'Neill had referred to him as ""Walter"" in the Season 4 episode ""2010"", the producers could not get clearance for a renaming into ""Walter Davis"". The new name is based on General Hammond referring to Jones's character as ""Airman"" (sounding like ""Harriman"") in the pilot episode, and ""SG-1"" writer Joseph Mallozzi explained the resulting incongruity as a married-name issue. One scene in ""Zero Hour"" features Pierre Bernard, a graphic designer for the NBC show ""Late Night with Conan O'Brien"", as technician O'Brien. The ""SG-1"" producers saw Bernard ranting on ""Late Night"" about ""Stargate SG-1"" being better without Daniel Jackson (actor Michael Shanks was not part of ""SG-1"" during Season 6), and gave him a cameo spot."
"Producer Robert C. Cooper was satisfied with ""Zero Hour"", claiming that Richard Dean Anderson ""is fantastic in this episode. It's new-yet-classic O'Neill and fans of the character will be forever pleased with this."" When ""Zero Hour"" first aired on the Sci Fi Channel on July 30, 2004, it achieved a 2.2 Household rating, equaling approximately 3 million viewers. Tied with ""Icon"", this marked the sixth-highest rating for any Season 8 episode of ""Stargate SG-1""."
"While small generators may be cooled by air drawn through filters at the inlet, larger units generally require special cooling arrangements. Hydrogen gas cooling, in an oil-sealed casing, is used because it has the highest known heat transfer coefficient of any gas and for its low viscosity which reduces windage losses. This system requires special handling during start-up, with air in the generator enclosure first displaced by carbon dioxide before filling with hydrogen. This ensures that the highly flammable hydrogen does not mix with oxygen in the air."
The hydrogen pressure inside the casing is maintained slightly higher than atmospheric pressure to avoid outside air ingress. The hydrogen must be sealed against outward leakage where the shaft emerges from the casing. Mechanical seals around the shaft are installed with a very small annular gap to avoid rubbing between the shaft and the seals. Seal oil is used to prevent the hydrogen gas leakage to atmosphere.
"The generator also uses water cooling. Since the generator coils are at a potential of about 22 kV, an insulating barrier such as Teflon is used to interconnect the water line and the generator high-voltage windings. Demineralized water of low conductivity is used."
The generator voltage for modern utility-connected generators ranges from in smaller units to in larger units. The generator high-voltage leads are normally large aluminium channels because of their high current as compared to the cables used in smaller machines. They are enclosed in well-grounded aluminium bus ducts and are supported on suitable insulators. The generator high-voltage leads are connected to step-up transformers for connecting to a high-voltage electrical substation (usually in the range of 115 kV to 765 kV) for further transmission by the local power grid.
"The necessary protection and metering devices are included for the high-voltage leads. Thus, the steam turbine generator and the transformer form one unit. Smaller units may share a common generator step-up transformer with individual circuit breakers to connect the generators to a common bus."
"Most of the power station operational controls are automatic. However, at times, manual intervention may be required. Thus, the plant is provided with monitors and alarm systems that alert the plant operators when certain operating parameters are seriously deviating from their normal range."
"A central battery system consisting of lead–acid cell units is provided to supply emergency electric power, when needed, to essential items such as the power station's control systems, communication systems, generator hydrogen seal system, turbine lube oil pumps, and emergency lighting. This is essential for a safe, damage-free shutdown of the units in an emergency situation."
"To dissipate the thermal load of main turbine exhaust steam, condensate from gland steam condenser, and condensate from Low Pressure Heater by providing a continuous supply of cooling water to the main condenser thereby leading to condensation."
The consumption of cooling water by inland power stations is estimated to reduce power availability for the majority of thermal power stations by 2040–2069.
= = = Lathe center = = =
"A lathe center, often shortened to center, is a tool that has been ground to a point to accurately position a workpiece on an axis. They usually have an included angle of 60°, but in heavy machining situations an angle of 75° is used."
"The primary use of a center is to ensure concentric work is produced; this allows the workpiece to be transferred between machining (or inspection) operations without any loss of accuracy. A part may be ""turned"" in a lathe, sent off for hardening and tempering and then ground ""between centers"" in a cylindrical grinder. The preservation of concentricity between the turning and grinding operations is crucial for quality work."
"A center is also used to support longer workpieces where the cutting forces would deflect the work excessively, reducing the finish and accuracy of the workpiece, or creating a hazardous situation."
"A center lathe has applications anywhere that a ""centered"" workpiece may be used; this is not limited to lathe usage but may include setups in dividing heads, cylindrical grinders, tool and cutter grinders or other related equipment. The term ""between centers"" refers to any machining operation where the job needs to be performed using centers."
"A center is inserted into a matching hole drilled by a center drill. The hole is conical near and at the surface, and cylindrical, deeper."
"A dead center (one that does not turn freely, i.e., ""dead"") may be used to support the workpiece at either the fixed or rotating end of the machine. When used in the fixed position, a dead center produces friction between the workpiece and center, due to the rotation of the workpiece. Lubrication is therefore required between the center and workpiece to prevent friction welding from occurring. Additionally the tip of the center may have an insert of cemented carbide which will reduce the friction slightly and allow for faster speeds. Dead centers are typically fully hardened to prevent damage to the important mating surfaces of the taper and to preserve the 60° angle of the nose. As tungsten carbide is much harder than steel, a carbide-tipped center has greater wear resistance than a steel center."
Soft centers are a special version of the dead center in which the nose is deliberately left soft (unhardened) so that it may be readily machined to the correct angle prior to usage. This operation is performed on the headstock center to ensure that the center's axis is aligned with the spindle's axis.
"A revolving center, also known as a live center in some countries, is constructed so that the 60° center runs in its own bearings and is used at the non-driven or tailstock end of a machine. It allows higher turning speeds without the need for separate lubrication, and also greater clamping pressures. CNC lathes use this type of center almost exclusively and they may be used for general machining operations as well. Spring-loaded centers are designed to compensate for center variations, without damage to the work piece or center tip. This assures the operator of uniform constant tension while machining. Some live centers also have interchangeable shafts. This is valuable when situations require a design other than a 60° male tip. A live center, which may be hard or soft, is a plain center placed in the revolving mandrel; it moves and is therefore live."
"A pipe center, also known as a bull nose center is a type of live center which has a large diameter conical nose rather than a sharp point. This allows the center to be used in the bore of a pipe or other workpiece with a large interior diameter. While a pipe center ensures the workpiece remains concentric, its main advantage is that it supports the workpiece securely, and can be used for parts whose larger inner diameter prevents the use of a normal pointed center. Thin-walled material such as pipes easily collapses if excessive force is used at the chuck end."
"There are two types of cup centers. The woodworking variety is a variation of the traditional live center. This type of cup center has a central point like a normal live center and also has a ring surrounding it. The ring supports the softer material around the center point and prevents the wood from splitting under pressure from the central point. A different variety of cup center is used for metalworking. The metalworking variety of cup center has a tapered hole rather than a conical point. It supports the part by making contact with the outside diameter of the end of the part, rather than using a center hole."
"A drive center, also known as a grip center, is used in the driving end of a machine (headstock). It is often used in woodworking or where softer materials are machined."
"It consists of a dead center surrounded by hardened teeth, which bite into a softer workpiece allowing the workpiece to be driven directly by the center. This allows the full diameter of the workpiece to be machined in a single operation, in contrast with the usual requirement where a carrier is attached to the workpiece at the driven end. The use of modified shell end mills in a drive center, instead of hardened pins, enables better gripping and prevents breakdown time due to pin stop."
"A spring center is a metalworking lathe center for maintaining a cutting tool like a reamer or a tap, in axial alignment with a hole being worked on. It consists of a point backed by a spring to push the cutting tool into the workpiece."
