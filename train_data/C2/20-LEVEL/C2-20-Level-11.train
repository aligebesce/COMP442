"Me me me mention yo , something in the newsletter."
Wa wondered if you  were gonna do anything.
"So, I said no, I'd mentioned it to you and talked about it."
I think he must think we're complete idiots or something!
"I've got a temperature, by the way."
Mum?
"Are you going to sit there and read the paper, or do nothing?"
I'm reading the paper!
I wanted my cup of tea and I'm tired!
"Well you gonna, oh I've gotta bring a cup of tea in for you, have I now?"
Oh yeah.
he said what's the coin?
And he says nineteen sixty two when I started reffing  and he said the oth they're not  I'm not giving them this one but these two are for the other mascot scene.
You lost out there didn't you really ?

No chance  sorry you can't have it?
Dunno.
Geoff Thomas sent for
He asked on your behalf didn't he?
Yeah.
Well you can't ask any more of Geoff Thomas than that I suppose.
I wonder why that little bit was in the paper about Geoff Thomas being  absolutely priceless?
Was it cos someone's
What bit?
someone's after him again?
What bit?
There was a little article in the Sun I told you about.
Alan Smith saying  Geoff Thomas is absolutely priceless.
Er  all he's got to do is score more goals.
That's what I couldn't understand.
What a nerve!
.I think he meant for England.
"All he had to do to seal his England career was pop in a two, a few goals like he does at Palace"
Yeah.
and er  could be on the way to a regular spot.
He is in a regular spot at the moment.
Well I don't know.
"Hope, hope that's true."
I think his name's actually written out.
I'm not sure
It's like trying to unite the churches.
Yeah.
It looks like somebody Plus Plusky Oh yeah.
No.
Oh well.
It's signed by s .
Oh no sorry..
That can't possibly say .
Well it says Leslie  at the top.
But there's something else underneath.
I mean is that
but is that a Greenpeace central office thing or is it erm
A local group.
a local group?
East Herts.
"But does it, Pat  does it  doesn't he?"
for Herts yeah.
He still does it now.
How do you know?
that have got so involved in that.
Yeah.
And and Bob  did it  here in Bishop's Stortford but I don't know whether he's still  I think he still does it because he was very committed.
But I I just  Pat was doing it for Bishop's Stortford on or thereabouts because he sent me all the details about the whale walk .
Cos I I gave his name to this guy organizing the one world week.
And he hadn't had any joy out of Greenpeace.
Can I borrow that a minute?
What this?
Yeah
The problem we've got with Greenpeace they might not have so much in the way of merchandise and they just have the stickers and
There's the   leaflets.
Yes.
Thank goodness for that!
"I wouldn't want one of those, one of the pacers or sprinters or metros spoilt."
But dad!
They're all multiple units  at sometimes.
"Yes, of course they are, but we, I was talking about the old sort of diesel multiple unit."
Yes.
One with the yellow front.
"You can get all different sorts of, one with two red lights erm  one with two windows"
Can you?
Yes.
Mm.
I'm pleased you know your trains.

Right.
Well I'm gonna have to start thinking about getting ready.
What about you getting ready for bed now?
Dad.
Mhm?
What about the Manchester  crossing disaster?
Which one was that?
"Er, just outside Manchester."
Mm mm.
Can't remember that one.
The one about those two boys playing on the track.
Oh!

No.
No.
I got it from the telly.
Oh!
Did you now?
Forget about it Nick!
Did you hear that ?
Did you hear what he said?
"Oh well, basically  well"
Mm!
oh it's nothing of interest.
Er
Shut up!
What ?
Do what?
Do what?
"Oh well, nothing of interest."
"Erm, no  yo I've, er I've asked him at the parents' evening what he expected us to do for economics, right?"
And yo you're never gonna guess what he wants us to do for our final bit of course work?
We have got to go and stand outside Marks and Spencers  and ask questionnaires  and we've gotta do the same in Wimbourne.
Ridiculous or what!
I think it's crap!
I think it's pathetic!
Er here!
Er here !
I think it's ridiculous!
We're never gonna get that done are we?
Are you gonna go and stand outside Marks and Spencers and get arrested?
For asking surveys?
Oh God!
I think it might be worthwhile actually so the school can come and bail us out!
Urgh!
God it's ridiculous!
I mean  will be arrested for kerb crawling!
"I mean, you can't do that sort of thing, surely!"
"Oh well, I think it's ridiculous!"
"As you can tell, I said, Andy's been drinking  I think."
Well you can write save money across the top then
"Well I, I wrote actually that article for the the Herald and Post that has appeared in Harlow but not here."
A  whole load of tips  like that.
Oh.
"Now every week I open Herald and Post and think oh it's gonna be in there, it's gonna be in there but it never is."
It's only appeared in Harlow and she told me it would get in the Bishop's Stortford one but it hasn't so far.
It's a bit annoying really.
Who does all the schools?
As to recycling.
They must be checked.

Can I just have a look Kath?
Yeah.
He organized it all and then I think was it a week before he suddenly said  well we can't possibly have two hundred people walking along  a nature trail  that we want to protect.
And he was really of the illusion that there might be  I think two hundred no six hundred people
Two hundred people might turn up.
turning up.
In the end I think three people turned up.
Oh.
"It was, it was  no it was"
This looks really interesting.

Yeah.
"and it always ends up going right, so they don't dry, right funny so it don't d or it rains."

Naturally.
"And many of my staff in s in not just  but one or two others, see this as the tail wagging the dog if you like where somebody says, you will do so and so, or you know, I'm telling you you'll do this."
Now it's how you read that into that procedure.
That's the problem with it.
There's no problem I
I understand that.

Why should the Q S estimate all our work?
Mm.

Hundred and forty three.
How else ?
See the  this  th the there's got to be summat wrong.
"But if you, if you add all them up, and then add up all what there is in there  there's summat wrong."

Put the phone down again.
"And then I thought, well you can always and like say, can you tell Scott!"
And I will
Can you tell I've come on so I'm not pregnant!
Alright?
And I thought like  his mum might not find that really amusing or anything

"so he'd know, like  erm"
Tell him he's not a daddy!
Yes !
"ring  , could you tell Scott that er  that erm  oh God, I don't know!"

Tell him he doesn't have to go to confession with Helena!
That's right !
Oh gee!

Ooh I wonder what that could be about ?
"Er, like this morning at break  I walked, I walked straight past Peter  right  and er  come up to me and he goes  that's not very nice is it?"
I thought what !
"He  just walked straight past me, oh well I'm so sorry and he goes  what's wrong with you anyway lately?"
Nothing!
Nothing wrong with me !
Well yeah he hasn't gotta buy

Well no.
"stuff he, you know."
"See my dad likes videos and things like that  but he wa he, I know he likes aftershave, he likes that Old Spice and that so I thought well I'll  get him something like that or  I thought I  sort of saw cos I'm going shopping Saturday, I'm trying to get it all Saturday if I can."

"It says a Christmas service will be held in the  oh no it isn't  the juniors are now helping the infants with their nativity story on Wednesday the eighteenth of December  this was originally  a advertised, by me, at taking place at six thirty in Walton St. Peter Church, I'm afraid this was a mistake on my part, as in fact the performance is rather ten thirty on the da on that day at Walter St. Andrew Church."
This timing will enable even the youngest children to take part.
Er er er er er!
I I !
And we're talking at the same time as well?
Oh let's not all talk at the same time!
Let's be Magic Roundabout people!

"I was saying, oh yeah  erm Shrimpy like, we, me and Scott were playing snooker  and I, I came in to see if like, either of  you, anyone else wanted to play doubles  and like,Swimp , Shrimpy was just sat by himself in the middle of the floor, cross-legged just sat there like a little pixie or something!"
"Well, no not a little"
And I just went

"Right, so a six foot three pixie, never mind!"
But like  he was just sat there!
"And I went over, I goes you alright?"
"He goes, yes!"
Oh sorry!
Please forgive me!
"I goes, do you wanna go, go and play snooker?"
"So he goes, yeah alright then."
"Oh come on you can be on my side  cos it was obvious, like, he was just sort of sat there."
Mm.
"And erm  and then like, he went back in after we'd finished playing and me and Scott carried on playing for a bit  and then erm  what was he going?"
"Oh yeah, he told me afterwards right, that he, the only reason he was angry was because Friday night reminded him of the time in his past or something!"
"And Pete reminded him of, him of the person that he hated and all this!"
"And I was thinking  Shrimpy, you're stupid!"
Get a life !
You sure!
Oh !
"And then, cos I thought boy!"
So what did he do?
They just
left a broken bottle
clean cut right down the bone
Oh god
"so, he's out of commission for a couple of weeks."
"Yes, it's er infection really isn't it?"
Yes
And if he's anything like this guy he's all go

Well enough.
"Take care anyway,come on E T"
"That's right, yeah, yeah."
Oh he said er

"I haven't been away, but I've been off work like"
"Oh just, oh I see"

I don't know these things.
No.
Well you don't get them.
I do and I feel obliged to pass it all on.
I can't just sort of
No.
"But it, I, it's only six ninety five and I thought if we had  you know a few facts at our fingertips to say well that's all rubbish you know."
So what is that?
Is that er  booklet or something?
It's a book.
Book.
Just  talking about al you know alternative
On erm  renewable yeah
energy really I think.
Yeah.
Because  they keep saying oh what's gonna happen when the whole population of China wants a fridge and
Mm god!
I haven't got an answer for things like that.
Mm.
There is no answer really.
Because  want to catch up with us and we're already using too much energy.
change your lifestyle.
I just thought  the more facts you've got at your fingertips the more easy it is to persuade people.
Yeah if we've got some money we might as well spend it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Educate ourselves.
An and the next day of action  as I said before is on tropical rainforests erm .

"This is where there wasn't an accident, thank God, but we did find"
out er we had nobody on site at the time.
Work had been planned to be carried out during the possession on a Saturday night to carry out some pointing
Ha we've had this one.
only
We haven't briefed it.
We haven't briefed it.
Did we not brief it last month?
No.
We haven't briefed
No.
We discussed it.
We did it at the safety meeting.
One which
Yeah.
Erm work was organized during to  Saturday night during the possession which included people standing in the four-foot i in the tracks.
And what are you saying it is now?
Fifty eight pound a day.
That's an awful lot more isn't it?
Yeah.
There's  I mean so many of them have caught on.
"Jan for example, when we had the  the town hall thing, that was five pound a day."
Yeah.
It's twenty five pound a day now.
I think they've just all jumped on the bandwagon.
They don't provide anything really do they?
"Well no, that's it."
So as soon as she said that it was in use Monday Wednesday I sort of
If we went to
subconsciously ruled it out.
"village hall, church hall"
Yeah ?
"which is a church hall, they don't have a charge, you have to make a contribution."
Where's this sorry?
"Well you, you need to, it's pretty grotty, it's a grim place"
Mm.
but it's er it's the church  the parish hall  in .
Whether they've got tables and stuff like that I'm not sure.
Mm.

Oh .
"But er, Danny says that they said that they were"
People had been in!

"Yes I know, but he  he said people are in last week!"
But that's what
They're overflowing with bookings for the summer!
Oh!
And now?
"Yeah, cos they could have three times as many caravans!"
By June  they'd let them go!
They're overflowing with them!
Not now!
"Of course, you see, it's you that's using the caravan this week so they can come here  they  can they?"
No.
Somebody comes quick and wants the caravan  they're supposed to be there ready!
Oh!
Ooh the sun is warm!
"Oh, I'm fine, thank you."
Put that save.
Make sure I don't lose that.
Okay.
"Right, so, and you're going to the, what's the seminar at five is it or"
"That's right,oh, yes, I received this letter."
Yeah.
I don't know if you've heard about it?
No.
"Erm, well, I was"
Yeah.
"and I mean, I considered myself to have been like, er, frequent, or erm, whatever."
"So er, on the last seminar, they all talked about sending out letters to all the students who weren't there  the attendance was very low, and I received one, but"
Right.
enough.
"And er, I was also asked why I had  offered to  and I'd already spoken to the students' secretary about it."
Yeah.
So I wrote back to  and
Mm.
Yeah.
I'm not giving the paper for health reasons.
I have been
Right.
"I will, I will mention, I didn't know they were sending out such a letter, otherwise I would have er, told them in advance."
But I will
I'm on the street for the moment
"I, absolutely, I'll, I'll speak to everyone, don't worry."
"I mean, don't worry"
"So are you, are you be going to seminar?"
Yes.
Yeah.
"Yeah,I have to ."
Erm now how are we going to measure acceleration?
"Let's say we've got erm a radar for, for measuring speed"
Mm.
velocity.
Okay.
"And we'll set up a, so we're going to, you, you devise an experiment, Neil."
Measure acceleration.
"There's a car, and we want to know its acceleration between two points."
doesn't matter.
There's your car.
Erm  you start the stopwatch.
Er stopwatch you m you time it from  there  to the ten metre.
Erm what's along your X axis?
Your independent variable?
Time.
Time.
"So, when would you next check its acceleration?"
Would you measure in terms of distance
"or in, in terms of other time"
Time.
Ten seconds.
Ten seconds.
We'll make it one second.
Okay.
Make it one second.
"Alright, make it ten."
"Sorry,, make it ten seconds."
Plus one second.
"Then the you have to  have y how far the car has travelled,"
Do you?
know how quickly.
What is acceleration?
I.
Oh aye.
Aye said the fly.
Here's my little
"I said cos I shall phone the bank first thing Monday and I shall say right, he's took the car so you can run to him for the money cos you'll be getting none out of me."
Then I had a letter from the social  security.
They've been paying me thirty nine pound sixty haven't they?
"And I've been, been  to fifty five pound  seventy five every week."
Oh.
So you'll get a bit back then?
Yeah.
So I think
it's better
Well they're on about backdating it to the third.
But if I write back and say I haven't actually had any wages since the seventeenth of January  I might get it backdated from then.
What's that?
Did  do what he said he was gonna do then?
Yeah.
Oh.
Have you had any repercussions?
Yeah they went to work in it the next day.
Did they?
Yeah.
"What, with all the tyres done?"
Yeah.
How'd they get there?
Well I dunno.
"Michael said it were there at  erm five to twelve, when he  erm quarter past twelve when he come out of work they got in it."
But he don't know what time they got there cos he don't work in that warehouse.
So he was gonna ask  if they got in late because  they could have had time to get it repaired.
Oh I see.
Did mum tell you we went to see the Bachelors last night?
Hint!
Hint!
I mean what could I do?
And then as we approached the tube station the arm around me again and erm  and he
But was he a fellow choir man as well?
Yes!
It's awful you see because it's so
"I would have been, been very rude to him."
"But no, but I can't  couldn't afford to be rude to him, I've only just joined the choir."
Well in future whenever he suggests something  I think what you've got to do
There's some in here.
Okay?
I've got  two here.
"is never  you know, join the breaks or whatever  and just make sure  you're not left alone"
Mm.
you're with other girls.
"Well, I'm sorry, he just came on so strong."
Mm.
"And, so I was forced into lying."
I said erm  I've enjoyed the concert but I'm afraid
Yeah.
"a , er you know, I don't want there to be any."
"misunderstanding, and he, he said explain."
So I had to lie.
Certainly.
"and I said erm, I'm going out with someone."
Cos I thought he hasn't taken any of my hints so far.
"Erm, and he said, oh that sort of un , misunderstanding?"
And then I thought I'd really put my foot in it  and embarrassed both of us
Ha.
"so   there was silence until we got to the tube station and he said, how long have you been going out with this man?"
Said oh  I thought oh Becky would laugh if I told her this .
What was she wearing?
it was sponsored.
I read it in the
Black and white.
paper and thought   well that would have been quite nice.
Mm mm.
Did you go with him?
I'll come to that.
You said yes did anyway.
"I said yes thinking Mozart would be lovely, and not thinking any more of it  until he stuck to me like a limpet"
for the rest of the  concert and  the penny began to drop  erm  He said something about the tube station not being the most romantic place to meet  and I kind of brushed it off by saying well at least we won't get wet there or something.
Mm mm.
"And then he said er, I said to him about"
I've got to get the last train home.
"He said don't worry, I have the winter timetable."
He's a train spotter.
He's got a green anorak with toggles
I see.
on.
And
I think it's better
Don't!
Alright.
He's tall but
he's tall which is great.
No problem.
He's in his  well actually probably pushing forty at this stage.
"But, he's got  he's got a a big round red face  and little eyes"
"and a moustache, and the most peculiar little  bit under"
"Bit, yes."
there.
But really it's just like
Yeah.
you know?
"And I'm just gonna say  you know, I think it would  be better if Scott didn't rush in like that, you know?"
"I can understand why he did it, to be quite honest."
"Yeah but you say to her  that they're always on about how s Shrimpy can't do anything for himself, and it's between Emma, it's not between  it was al even Scott said to me at the beginning oh it's not between me, it's nothing to do with me, it's between Emma and Scott."
Emma and Shrimpy.
Emma and Shrimpy then.
"And erm  he's been, then he rushes ahead full storm  don't he?"
Mm.
"He shouldn't have done that really, he was a bit naughty."
"He,sh she ought to learn to sh she's, they was all on about how Shrimpy can't stick up for himself, and then flaming  Emma does exactly the same but worse cos she gets Scott to do it for her."
"She's gonna have to one of these, I'm not being funny but she can't stick up for herself, that girl can't."
"It's about time she had the courage to do it, herself if she's in a strop."
"There's no point getting Scott, cos what's gonna happen when she finishes with Scott?"
She really
Oh
As you've probably gathered.
oh I need your love babe
What's this?
yes I know it's true  erm
Where's the tape?
hold me love me hold me love me  you
What was this af what was it after?
What's just been on?

a Week this is   love me  ain't got nothing but love babe
"It's not on here, eight da oh yeah it is."
eight days a week
"And I Love Her no I mean I Feel Fine, Ticket to Ride and Yesterday, oh yes!"
I like them.
Help I need somebody  that's on side B.
I'm not really sure.
"Well it must say, la la la la"
"Ah, two thousand eight, got it right!"
"And that says, twenty seven from"
You're not gonna stop insuring yourself are you?
"No, no, no, no, no!"
Oh no!
God!
Increase the premiums.
Twenty seven from the nine  two thousand one eight.
I still think it'd be good if my bike went walk about .
Be a good way of doing it.
Get it practically sawed up and that.
Got plenty of friends who would be willing to saw it up.
"Nineteen, I don't think that's a very good idea at all!"
I do!
Saying it's broken.
I'll stretch you for it.
Oh good!
Why?
"Well, only really because of erm  as mature, as policies mature  before the er"
What do you mean they mature?
You can collect them?
Yeah.
Before
Are they pensions?
"No, no, no, no!"
"They're, they're er  and er life insurance against the mortgage."
What?
You borrow money
Yeah.
and then you use life insurance to pay it off.
Well I shouldn't think so because
Mum!
they're not gonna want to know!
They don't belong there.
Yeah.
"and you can't complain to th , the Chamber of Commerce because  if they show this up too much"
Temby's  gonna lose a lot of trade!
I don't want
Yeah.
Mm.
I mean
"They have their, their"
I said to him we've been conned!
I said we've been stitched up!
That's how I look at it!
I was furious last week!
"Mm, so I ju , I was just trying to find, but you see, there again you're new people, we found new people last week didn't we."
Yeah.
He wasn't happy  that man.
"He bought a big caravan, he was very unhappy!"
There we are!
The way they do
"No, but these caravans"
Should you carry on?
"I don't know, is it here or over there?."
"So you see, this is only way you can  them!"
"Get to a situation where you've had a caravan before  and to make any money to pay, you've then got to  buy another caravan  to subsidise that one  and you seem to be  it's sort of"
like a chain all time.
Mm.
Yeah.
And the profit you've had from one is paying the expense of the other!
"Tha , if you're lucky!"
I still haven't a clue of what er the
"the pamphlet, it's far too complicated for me."
She's like that.
"I mean, she's really sweet."
Mm mm.
I'm very careful never  to admire things or enthuse about things.
Because she's likely to give them to you?
Because she's likely to give them to you.
"I mean, she knows I love Gardenia"
Mm mm.
and because she was in  Mustique  and hadn't bought me a birthday present  she made sure that there were two Gardenia plants at the party that night she bought me.
Really?
She's like that.
Mm.
She knows we love the pink champagne.
Mm mm.
The brand is in.
And it's not  kind of standard champagne in the place  but she always keeps a supply.
Always has champagne.
Got any champagne at home?
Get another bottle of that.
He must be running low.
"You see I, I mean I know obviously the perks don't outweigh all that, er, at least you do get some perks."
"At least you know, she can be generous and"
Yes.
But she can be absolutely demonic  there's no doubt about that.
She really can.
Mm.
And she drives you insane!
"Well like you said last time, I think only a man can put up with her."
Mm.
That's probably why she got through so many women.
And I ate me butty there on top.
In the pouring bloody rain and howling wind I expect.
"It was, yeah  it was horrible ."
So then I just had a drive round all the sites.
Did you find them all alright?
Yeah.
I know where I'm going now with er all of them.
"You know and getting to them, I know how to get from one to the other  without going, you know?"
All round the houses.
I've got a good idea of where everywhere is.
So I was quite pleased.
Mm.
When I got back  ooh  you know I told you about that job?
We've put a bid in for Arrow Park.
Mm.
Rob thinks we've got it.
Oh god.
Winning some bloody jobs aren't you.
"What have they done, dropped their prices?"
Well Rob's doing them isn't he?
Oh they have had to drop their prices.
"They've had to  go for the  we did them a few sort of quotes on the survey side of this Arrow Park  and er  we've gotta, you know, really stick to this tight budget because it's the only way you can get them no matter what people are telling you  erm  about the recession being over, people still want things for nothing."
So  this survey might have to be done at the beginning of April.
But it's not a big one so
"Well when's these in Caernarvon, the end of April?"
Starting the twenty seventh of April.
It's the weekend after  's wedding?
Yeah.
So I shall be enjoying myself at  the wedding
Mm.
ready for my hard slog.
Eh?
Yeah.
Well people do that here though don't they?
Se sell them to Africa and places  yeah .
alright if it doesn't rain actually so it wouldn't matter if they didn't have treads on er  treads on the tyres if it's dry it doesn't really matter you just go round slicks and
I think could chop them up and use them to make road surfaces with.
Yeah but percentages is
Mm.
At least you know they can do it!
Mm that's right.
Oh they can do quite a lot of it.
"I mean even the, the su surface out of the play in playgrounds ."
Mm.
I can never quite work out why that .
most roads
"So, so far I've got two coffees here and one tea."
Anybody else for anything?
I'll have a coffee please.
Coffee?
Black please.
Black coffee.
White.
White.
White.
So we've got about six weeks in which to do this.
So how many weeks
I mean there's no  excuse I   all the jobs are quite quickly done  aren't they?
Yeah.
So what  we ought to have a deadline for collect collecting the information.
And then get together
Yeah.
to put it together.
And then decide on
Mm
that you could use
Okay.
and erm  er that's what I used if you want to borrow that you can.
Thanks.
"And do it in pencil and just, and then we can  rub it out"
yes.
"and change things and so on, yeah."
Well it's easy to change isn't it?
Because presumably Peter will need to incorporate that  in an overall programme.
When we look at the highway side.
So it's just the traffic side which I'm dealing with here?
Yes.
Cos that's all I'm dealing with.
Okay and perhaps erm  perhaps you'd also like to l would you like to look at this side of things as well?
Incorporate that into it?
"No, the, the layout plans, do, do some layout plans."
Oh yeah sure.
Marty's done them before you see haven't you?
Yep.
"So I'm, I'm just trying to look at the ones for   and then we'll go from there."
"Okay, is that alright?"
Yeah.
"Now, have I given either of you task schedules for this"
No.
stuff?
So  I need to do that don't I?
Er  in fact I never gave  telephone call  it's no good telling me to do something
"Task schedules,ooh   I'll have to get the form."
"Okay, so you want a task schedule for doing  doing the traffic report?"
Mhm.
Mm yeah?
What a mistake you made.
Right what are we doing John?
Chairs we're doing today.
"There's six of those to do, now then."
"Yeah  put them in the sale, you know  I'm gonna put them in the sale  see if we can get a few bob  right, pattern first I should imagine."
many people coming to the sales.
I won't let you
"I've only put, I've put stuff in."
Yeah.
You know but
I er never actually
"I, I  I made about sixty quid last year, you know?"
"Oh yes I believe  it gets er quite a lot, it's er  well yesterday there weren't many for that open day."
"But for the sale er  it's well advertised you know and er there's a lot of people seem to know about it, you know connected with the college mainly I suppose, they get their mates to come  ooh there's good stuff  and there is some good stuff, you know?"
Yeah.
So it's er it seems to do pretty well.
"I'll er I'll try to get a few things, make a few bob you know, to"
"don't mind me asking, what would you expect to ?"
Don't know yet.
Well I'm hoping a hundred plus
you know?
Yeah.
"Well christ you've gotta be, I've paid that to be honest"
Yeah
I've paid seventy for the bloody things.
Yeah.
Erm  I dunno
Oh they're nice chairs
"hundred and thirty maybe I'm not, I'm not quite sure to be honest er  not quite sure old mate."
"Yeah I'll see what they say, you know, erm I'll  John, he had a set of erm  high backed  reproduction erm  what do they call them now?"
"Regency  nineteen twenties,in the twenties"
Yeah
she's a teacher and I think she thinks that teachers are the only ones that work!
Yeah.
Oh bloody hell!
And I said something
Cor!
to her like erm
Oh yeah .
Yeah.
"erm, what did I say?"
Something about  oh what did I say?
"She's a funny woman anyway, I said something like"
They are  peculiar breed!
I should think  I should think you  it's nice to have the six weeks  ahead of us  and she said  well it's not a holiday!
I thought well I wouldn't mind
Ooh no!
six weeks of not having to get up and you gotta go.
"No, not going into the shop at least, yeah."
Cor!
"She said  she said for the first week you unwind, I thought  if we have a weeks holiday that means that the time you unwind you're back to work again!"
You're back to work .
That's right.
She said and then I have two weeks  erm  homework to mark  and then we have a weeks holiday  I thought well that's two weeks
Yeah.
holiday
Cor!
really.
That's it.
She said and then the next week you're preparing to go back!
Well why can't she do that  two weeks marking in that first week she needs to unwind?
Yeah.
And then have a
"And yet  another client of mine who's a teacher, she said oh yeah she said it's lovely, she said  I suppose I ought to do the  marking and all that  at the beginning she said but I leave it, she said, and I sometimes do it in the last week."
But we got go grammatical each person has to speak.
Why don't they go out  Well I can have somewhere else  but they can all have their quiet place to talk.
Is it tonight Casualty on?

Yeah.
She'll wait up.

As long as she doesn't bloody ring us to say oh Susan's just rung.
I'll clonk her if she does.
You know what she's like.

And then you see you come along  where you're pushing them to live on their own and you  make suggestions.
That's right yeah.
And erm I went to a place in  and that's what I wanted to do.
But you see they ain't got no places here.
No.
Erm and it's a shame.

When you've got so much to offer.
Yeah.
"There's more people like that nowadays isn't there, than?"

Because at one time th I mean you never saw them because they were pushed away in in these
That's right.
great big hospitals and forgotten about.
Whereas now
That's right.
th they're coming out into community so you're seeing more of them.
Oh yeah.
And th th there's more but I mean  the facilities for them is there?
Well you see and I've also put in for a job  for the the marina at Northampton which is another mental home.
But that's for a mobility assistant where  I go in and befriend somebody and they employ me to take them somewhere for two hours.
Whether it be
Yeah.
pictures or  shopping or round the market or just for a walk or  for a meal.
Whatever you  they employ
Yeah.
Yeah she was erm  well  necessarily  cos  that day  Blue was working on the other team as well so he had his erm  break at different time.
Yeah.
"And I er  she comes storming out of the canteen  swearing  not at anybody in particular, just at herself really!"
"And then she's seen me, oh what time does Blue finish?"
I said whenever he  about half past three  so erm  so then she come down  Geoff said you gotta finish half past three Blue  my God!.
Oh.
And he did as well.
What you mean?
Well like sometimes I'll say to him everybody gonna finish about four  you know
Yeah.
"what happens, then his  she stands there, you bloody  by four  but I mean he finished when I said he was gonna finish  for a change I should think."
I didn't know Julia hadn't been in for a long while.
"No, what's the matter with her?"
"She'd erm  was erm  getting a pie out the oven  and cos some of the juice went on the floor, she wiped it up thinking she'd wiped it up properly and she didn't, she slipped, she's broken  a couple of bones in her foot."
Cor!

"As he says  it, it's the biggest holiday"
And
"company in Britain  and he said er, they just keep under  their"
Yeah.
legal limit!
He said.
You can't get them to admit that.
"And, and they'll keep all the profits that they can!"
They're not gonna let you get away with a lot!
"You know, such as new curtains!"
They try to bother  them.
"And I dare say, like these he said they  they've paid for their caravan, cash!"
So that's close to ten thousand pounds!
And they thought it was an investment!
Where as now they
find it had been better for them to have left their in the bank!
"Didn't say it so many words, but that's what he meant!"
And an investment on ten thousand's about twenty pound a week!
"So it's a lot of money to , I would think."
Perhaps he can
"She said thought, she'll only only let it out about six or eight times through the year!"
Well they haven't got total control over letting it!
.
No.
Perhaps they'll go.
Mark is making his will  isn't he?
Ah a good !
Oh she's left her dolly in there!
"Ooh God, Sally was taking her out!"

I mean this is ridiculous.
Yeah.
Turn that on for me will you?
Just
It's making work for everybody.
And one thing we don't want is extra work.
"I mean if we get finished now and clean the ki cooker and and clean everything  and say right, we're out of the kitchen then, nothing more tonight."
That's it.
If they want something they can get it themselves.
Yeah.
Yeah but  tell them to clean up after them.
Mm.
Don't leave it for you all the time.
Yeah.

Tin of peas  and a tin of spam.
"Mm, could you imagine me"
Lovely.
And throws it all in  puts it all on the plate cold  and puts it in the microwave.
No wonder he sits in the chair and does nothing.
Because they do it at home.
Eat that food now.

You're being perfectly silly.
"Erm, I can't think what you do tomorrow when you go with Steve ."

"Oh I mean I don't want it to be a party where everybody goes off into different rooms, you know?"
Yeah.
"And there's about three in the middle who go right, this is a good song"
"move my little finger, you know?"
"Want to have it where everybody's together, boogieing"
Don't know whether Clare's coming or not yet.
and having a laugh.
Well you'd better phone her up.
I said phone me if you're coming but don't bother if you're not so it looks like she's not.
Oh well if she turns up  does she know where you live?
She does doesn't she?
"Well yeah, she can find it."
What's this?
I Feel Fine.
"Did Jason Donovan sing this, afterwards?"
No.
Alright then.
She'll swallow that down nice and gently and it'll coat her tummy and it will gradually work its way through into the bowel and quieten them down as well.
Is this the medicine you're giving her?
Yes.
Yes.
Ju as long as you don't overload her.
This is
Aha.
this is the one thing that
her system can't stand.
It's when they retch er
That's right.
They try to empty what it is in their stomach and it
Right.
just comes out.
That's what I was doing last night.
Yeah.
Well  just out to the shop and get some ice-cream or make a table jelly when you go home.

Mm.
if you look at her tongue.
Pure white.
Why do they pretend not to know?
I mean they should be fully a aware of of of our
Val well this is a new guy.

Anyway that's that's my letter.
"Draft letter which I have not got, it's very very rough, for the press."
Sorry I've only got four.
That's alright.
"Actually some friends of mine were quite confused about what, why they shouldn't be able to throw their cooking oil away in their bin."
Because they said they'd always done it and they had nowhere else to put it.
Somebody else said oh you should throw it down the sink but I didn't think you were supposed to do that either.
What?
Cooking oil.
Cooking oil?
Yeah.
"If you have got one of those deep  fat fryers you, you have quite a bit to throw away."
Well don't put it in water.
things and leaflets.
Yeah I think it just depends whether the local group want to take up the option or not.
I don't think there's anything  I've got to tell you.
Er except there's a day of action but it's right  that's right into November now so  you can hear about that .
So we  this next meeting at

Well  this this this er Greenpeace letter predates the  September.

I think that's actually a bit too soon to get ourselves organized
Shall I shall I just write off and send them  like pound or  donation and a few leaflets could
Yeah.
"Say we're quite prepared to make a contribution, mm."
you put them out or  circulate them.
Yeah?
Yeah I mean don't think Rob would be interested.
Yeah.
He he ought to know about it though
I'll ask him about it.
Cos he lives up the road from there doesn't he?
Oh  yeah.

And I'll tell
not want to go.
Yeah.
Anyway I'll see you all on Wednesday
Thanks for coming.
and I've been working
"like a dog, it's been a hard day's night boom boom boom boom  sleeping  hope they don't come too early, although  then we'll, I can just leave a note."
that you do will make me feel alright  ta.
work all day   money
"work all day to get your  oh talk of the devil, Richard  's out there."
Ha your lover!
"Oh I, I was so frightened yesterday when he came round."
"He were just   made me laugh  come on then I'll just come out with you, in the garden."
"And I come out he goes oh it's cold I'm just gonna get me coat, I'll be back in a minute"
Ooh  he's dead creepy though isn't he?
Yeah.
He's alright though.
I know he's alright but
no problems.
"he kep I was laying there and I was just dropping off to sleep, I was oh it was , and he, in h in he waltzes  oh I, he, I, he goes what you doing in here?"
"I goes what the hell's it look like, I'm going to sleep!"
"He goes  he goes you can't go to sleep, and he sat on the edge of my bed for about quarter of an hour."
Your bed.
What do you mean your bed ?
You was on Andrew's.
Ooh ah
"Well I was only going to  sleep Jo , I wasn't doing anything, I'm just tired."
"Oh I can't put it in there, it's not going to fit."
things that you do
will make me feel alright
"And like he just, he just sat there  and it was, ooh it was so creepy."
"And like I thought I'm not gonna look up in case he goes for me or something, so I just kept my head in the pillow and pretended the light was blinding me  oh ha ha    cos when I get you alone   what?"
in their car.
What?
home
What's the matter?
I don't think    holding me tight tight
They might be symmetrical about here or here.
Or  it this way round.
What's that?
What's that?
That's a .
Erm
Well I mean what gives you that?
What gives you that?
"Well, what does that look like from the way you're looking at it?"
s
"The way you're looking at it, it looks something like erm Y equals X to"
X
the fourth plus three or something.
Mm.
Good.
So looking at it this way up I mean  it's  X equals Y to the fourth  plus three and that's all minus.
Mm.
X X equals three minus Y to the fourth.
It's a funny way of putting it.
Yeah.
But you could write your equation that way.
"Er if someone says that's not good enough, I want it in terms of Y equals"
"well okay we'll have to bring the three over to this side, and take the fourth root,."
"But you can always swap the axes, if you don't like what they give you."
Mm.
"So if, if I say  draw erm  Y equals the square root of X, and you think I haven't got a clue what that looks like."
You can square both sides.
"You can draw Y squared equals X, and all you have to do is say well, I can draw  the other way round."
Mm.
Y equals X squared.
"You draw your Y equals X squared,turn the paper round that way, and whichever way, I'm going to draw Y equals X squared."
"And erm   Y equals X squared, and that's Y and that's an X. Then turn it the other way up to get X equals Y squared, and now that's the Y and this is the X."
but when he gets
"It's not like that, no!"
"What they thought is because he's assessing them and she's, they're assessing us while he's assessing them."
If you know what I mean?
Alright!
"Now, they thought it was only gonna be two because there's only two assessing people, right?"
Yeah.
"But it turned out to be three and she was put in this  an awkward position and she doesn't know what to do, the poor girl who got picked!"
Mm.
"They a they'll have the other two, they got told in advance  but this one, she never."
And  that's all that happened.
"But she says you do,sh that you do get told."
But I'm taking no exam!
The R S A One exam!
Oh I know!
Oh!
"Mind you  if you say it's doing,yo er, started erm  writing to somebody you really like  and you've gotta get it perfect."
Mm.
"Well that'll be  that'll, that will really be hard won't it?"
Why?
I don't know.
Did she say you can use a dictionary?
Yeah.
Well that'll be da that's daft in your case!
Why is it?
Cos you ask me how to spell them!
Only because I can't be bothered to  look in the dictionary sometimes.
Ho!
No?

Mm?
"and er  sh , you know  the test before they could become officers  they set captain  set  the table, you see the  and  they have this  food that they know how, how to use the cutlery, this was one of the tests of being an officer."
Oh yeah!
Mm.
"You know, to er  they didn't know how to use the cutlery, and, they were, they we , yeah"
Which piece to use for which course.
"they weren't, they weren't gentlemen so they couldn't be er  they couldn't be officers."
Mm.
Oh there's a lot of that well done wasn't there?
It's called the class structure.
Yeah.
Or system.
"Well, ironically his creed was supposed to be without that wasn't it  Hitler?"
"You know, this supreme race but all  more or less equal."
"Well no, that wasn't the case!"
He wanted to create  a supreme race didn't he?
"No, but the er  the Germans  they were the supreme body weren't they?"
he's he's   and er  he wanted to create a super race.
But the army was run on the old style wasn't it?
Of course.
"You know, they were the  they were the er  the masters of the army."
"Oh well, this was the main course Ray!"
"And then of course the Air Force, they'd be one up again I suppose."
Ah well  then maybe
You mean the Luftwaffe?
Mm.
Mm mm.
The   .
Well this is
Luftwaffe.
Yeah.
You have your paper  you have your  bottles

To set it up
"it does , to set it up,yo you have  you have, you'll have to have three, three what's his names?"
"Three, three bin men  to come and collect it."

"idea he doesn't drink beer, so you can have his for"
"Well no,but I mean like"
But that's the key word is the long term Ken!
"like you sell, you sell that back  to them  that that pays  the man's wages that is doing it!"
Mm.
Mm.
"But it's the short term isn't it, with them?"
They just thinking well we haven't got the machinery to cope with this!
It's easier for us
No the

Why  why don't blind people parachute?
Don't know.
Scares the shit out of guide dogs.
"Cos I read these in a paper  and I thought hey these are very good ones here, I thought  I'll get them, I'll remember them."
You get worse.
"It's like our Albert, he tells that many jokes I can never remember half of what he tells me."
He told me one twice
I still can't remember the bleeder.
"He's pillock brained, your father, yesterday."
"There he is with the car, drives straight into the garage and the aerial goes ping!"
So he's waiting for you to come up and have a look at it.
And that's how you know whether you're  or not.
But you've also got your option of calories.

Which you are allowed
"Yeah, we could have done without all this bloody hassle down there."
Yeah.
You know?
Do the whole bloody place up.
Mm.
Mind you the firm that was in there Blue Bag I mean they abused the bloody place they did.
Aye.
They knocked it about something terrible.
Yeah.
"So I mean  sooner or later  would have been had to  to do, do up you know?"
Mm.
"And these people decide whether they want the place, and the ideal place for them."
Whether they want so
Er fourteen to twenty one.
That's what it is.
It's fourteen to twenty one.
What's that.
Mm.
Eh?
Opt er optional calories  .
"Well there ain't much that'd be fourteen to twenty, twenty calories is there?"
No.
You've got fourteen er fourteen options.
You need to be a mathematician to sort this bugger out.
You don't really
Thing is to do .
it's quite easy actually.
"This is a job if I don't lose it, feeding my dog beans one at a time."

Mm.
"Tins of baked beans, fourteen P."
"Do, what do they taste like, though?"
"Well, I should imagine they're just the same as their normal ones, and they've stuck a, a whacking great white label on them, but I mean, you know, perhaps they're of an inferior quality, I don't know."
I haven't tasted them yet.
Julia's had them and she said they were fine.
"Erm, well, rice pudding."

"Yeah, they're clean but I wanna clear up spots on my back!"
"Yeah, still wanna clear up the spots on my back."
Can you see through here mum?
Oh dear!
"I mean, I mean it wo that was pro , the lightest one on my"
Yeah.
neck!
That was lucky really in a way
Oh!

"And I was thinking, oh  I wa honestly I didn't know they were there."
"But like, Scott was going to me  he was going to me, oh stop complaining or I'll give you one your tit, like and  I goes  well I wouldn't mind so much if it was on my , I wear a bra all the time"

"I mean, no one 's gonna see it there are they?"
Closed!
Well
"Yeah but I'm, I I know I don't"
Well some of them certainly
And they closed one the other week that's flooded now

so that's
Yeah.
I don't think that this
"They, they won't they they wouldn't"
can't rescind that!
they wouldn't bring
But I
money on the mining
And that goes for a lot of businesses!
"I mean, there's enough coal  in the United Kingdom to last for another two hundred years!"
Yeah!
"And that could possibly be the only, and ah  I mean it's it's a"
Ah but
"it's a dirty fuel to use at the moment but they're all, there are means being developed even now on"
Well I've no doubt in twenty
I mean
years time the tories will re-open them
much  it's it's far
at at great cost to us!
Ah but you see
Nothing to stop them!
that  it's
Well
very short sighted to get rid of that now!
"I mean, we're buying coal which is subsidised abroad  so therefore it's cheaper for us to buy it  and bring it in, but what happens when all, all our home supplies have dried up"
I know  I know
Was Bleep in?
Yeah  he had a big do with the council man.
Why?
The council bloke come down
"Oh, what is Val's accent?"
Well west

Yeah.
to be exact.
"Well  I don't know  well that'll be on there if they want to know anyway now, you've just said it."
Mm  erm  yeah the council bloke come down and went in while his father was there
I see you've got no carpets down anywhere  the door's not painted  and he said you've been living here for two years!
Well what's the council man got to do with that?
Well they got a grant you see.
Well carpets ain't got nothing to do with it surely?
Yes they have  that's when I  the house is finished.
Oh.
"When your carpets were down, you moved in  so he's coming back December the eighth."
I thought he would have to tell them  got his carpets down.
He had a carpet just put down in his lounge.
Well he's got a lot to do then.
He was belly aching .
Cor!
How's how's the thing between Blue and
Completely  by now.
Good heavens!
Even the first day back  there was hardly any atmosphere at all very serious mood they were  but Kim keeps well out of it.
Oh I think she's the trouble maker there myself.
Yeah  she'll just keep well out of it.
I think  that's what started it all off I think she's running off.
Yeah.
Oh whatever you done?
"And Mark's there, I said he'll switch it off at night."
"Fine she said, as long as there's nothing left too near the fire."
"So I took the envelope off those tickets and I tore that up and wrote down and I stuck it in the  water heater that the sitting room fire may be on, please check."
I put another one then on the draining board.
"Cos if they're going to fix it round the sink, he doesn't know where they're gonna put it."
"You know, while I was there Darren came in."
And he said er have all the jobs been done yet?
And I said well no I said there's some water I said.
Mark's on holiday this week I said.
they've put him in another.
Oh that's right he said.
"I heard something about this he said, er  I was on holidays  all last week he said but erm  it's bloody lies cos I saw him last week."
And he said erm  yeah he said cos we've gotta pay this he said because it's all in the guarantee.
In the warranty.
And he came in and I said and the mirror on the dressing table isn't done.
You know and  that's gone and I said feel these beds I said.
They're soaking wet.
And he felt them and he said they are a bit he said.
"So I said well I  Danny rang this morning and he got permission to put the fire on  and put them, I'm going to move them all into the  front  and erm to air them up."
And I said there's no way anybody can sleep in there.
That's alright he said.
And he checked and then he went  So I took the bags off the pillows in case they were sweating in the bags and I put them out on the seats.
I put the quilts all out on the seats.
And .
"Because there's eight  there's er   seven, there's eight pillows then and"
He's done nothing.
Yeah.
He
Mm?
"The girl in the coun the girl behind the counter, the little tiny one."
Small and
She's still there?
Yeah?
"So in a way yo you're doing  different hours and all  so your pay, was that based on forty hour week?"
Or was that just based on  you being there whenever  you had to be there.
"Don't forget he's only started th , the job's only started a week!"
I'm just asking dear!
I'm paying for supper.
Yeah.
They're paying me for forty hours.
And anything you do above forty hours you can extra for?
Yeah.
"But, saying that  means you got a lot"
You don't have forty hours only to do.
I have.
"Because  the hour, the hours  forty  but   there's loads to be done ."
Yeah.
I'm getting them sorted out with Roy
"Well erm  have you had your pay yet from them, no?"
Tomorrow?
Yeah.
"So you, well then you'll still not know what you're going out with because you still have a few days from last week to get ."
"So you don't know what you'll start with, you'll actually bring in."
I will do.
Do you?
On my pay slip.
It doesn't make any difference  .
Do you remember the  form David got with the tax form and all?
"He's gonna give it into  Mericlean and Mericlean , just said we'll have to send it off  to the tax office to get your tax code changed."
"It's er, the tax code on his P forty five is ."
Well
His
it's like I'll get
twenty five.
And she said well it does take a time for the vans to dry out.
Mm.
Not until the sun comes hot and heavy on it.
"So whoever goes there, to anybody's van, that's what they're getting."
"Oh well, I should take advantage now Mark is in, bring the damn things from there."
Then you can get him to help you take them back on Friday.
I think we'd have to ring them up and let them know what we're doing.
Well go in office and tell them.
You can talk  personally better than on the phone.
Cos they are your mattresses aren't they?
When you take them back they're there for their inspection.
Unless you  you  take electric blanket down?
"Put it on, oh  You can't put that on a damp bed can you?"
Not really.
Don't think so.
Not
Well they are protected.
What?
Er er electric blankets.
Don't know.
"They're built er pretty, pretty good that way I think."
I don't know what about the lags for the wall
"And another thing, I didn't even look in Mark's room."
Was there pillows and blankets and quilts in his  caravan?
I didn't look.
Well perhaps Sally had a hunt
Dunno.

"And they're all back and  yeah even though they were all, they were all loose  I mean  still fresh you see the, the break."
"And it's, the life is in the, still in the tooth if you can find it, but of course sometimes they've gone haven't they?"
Too late for us

I'm Press Officer for North Yorkshire National Union of Teachers.
Yeah.
Yo you're very lucky actually Noel that this is not erm a quiz show.
Shall I tell you for why?
Why?
I'll tell you why cos the B B C there's a directive just gone out I've just been informed the B B C for quiz show hosts on the B B C to treat their guests with a little more civility.
Can you believe it?
How much more flipping civil can you get.
Have you heard these quiz sho I mean they're all on radio four aren't they?
All the quiz show  yeah basically ?
Well rad radio one as well.
Mm  Where do you live anyway?
In Leeds.

"Oh, great!"
So

You can't  and keep them open at the same time.
What is the most common problem you've experienced in your dealings with  Street?
It's phoning them up and the person I want to talk to isn't there!
I think.
"Have you had any, anybody else  phone them up or written to them?"
No?
No.
I think they're quite abrupt and rude whenever I've phoned them up.
Are they?
They're not terribly friendly.
"Oh they're usually okay I, I mean what they don't know  ."
I mean I just find it annoying cos you get through  to somebody who then passes you on to somebody else and then they'll talk to you and say well the person you want to talk to isn't here at the moment so you've had all this phone call and then you've got to ring again.
And you have to do it in office hours as well.

Yeah.
"Goes to get the flexible hose off  that was ruddy frozen, you the, the union?"
"Yeah, yeah"
"Rang him up again he said oh aye well we usually change those he said, the weather gets on them."

"Oh yes she said, we've had it  I thought well why send me letters,then!"
Well that's a standard letter I suppose and

Not even the one in the middle of my forehead?
No!
"I tell you what I noticed when you first walked in  you got  you got thick eyeliner on, that's what I noticed."
Yeah.
Before anything else.
"Thick eyeliner on the top of my eyes, I don't wear eyeliner on the bottom just in case you think I'm a tart!"
Oh dear!
Oh I'm sad!
I must be bad!
You're talking to a tape recorder now Em !
I know.
I've done it before!
"Oh gee, tomorrow right, mum has gone to me  the other day  oh, there's this woman at bridge she wants someone to baby-sit for her on Wednesday nights."
"Do want, do you wanna, you interested?"
"And I said, yeah alright then, you know, fair enough."
"So she goes  well she reckons it'll be a good idea if you went up to meet the little lad, he's only six, he's called Mark."
"I thought  oh alright, fair enough."
"She's goes, oh she's gonna phone Thursday night, she phoned me tonight  oh I'll pick you up at half four is that alright?"
"I thought, yeah, fair enough  she goes, we can go and pick him up from the child-minder  and then er  you can come for some tea  and you'll be home by about half seven!"
Oh fucking hell!
No way!
"I mean, cor blimey, I've never seen the woman or the kid before in my life!"

Irene's been doing it.
"Cos Irene says give me a ring I says no, I says that's it, I said I've already made the arrangement once and it backfired I says so I'm not doing it no more."
"I says when I'm not feeling well or slept in I says I'm gonna phone police station, I'm gonna go from there, see what they say."
Let them find somebody.
I says I'm not messing about no more.
Do you know everybody's had flu and God knows what and I can't catch it.
"I thought I had it again other day, I felt bleeding awful."
I had that at Christmas which made me bad all over Christmas  right ?
"And everybody , I says marvellous cos I can have some time off,, it's not fair."
"I'm not having that, that's cheating."
"If they can have some time off I can have some time off, fair's fair."
"It dries right quick, it just takes that chill off"
"Kath you've got alarms all over the bleeding place, what are you up to?"
I ain't done nowt.

That's right.
falling for a baby and then saying
No no

Well that makes me ill now.
"It didn't used to but when I, I, I, I feel like going up to these girls and saying for god's sake take that thing out of your mouth."
That's right.
When they're pregnant or they've got a little baby.
It's horrible.

"I remember the problem was last time sending those little plans out, the Ormskirk you know?"
"Give them the drawing number so we sent a transmittal note, course we never got a transmittal note back."
It's best to avoid that.

Okay?
"Erm  Now layouts, site layouts."

So are you leaving the ball in my court on that?

I mean again
standard thing that goes to all of them
"we need to write them, warn yeah, and we ask them to let us know what they've got planned don't we?"
Yeah.
So you could send them a letter with a little diagram that
Yeah.
"I wonder how good that is, yes I think that's alright isn't it?"
"Then they wouldn't  they'd understand what we, that meant wouldn't they?"
Yeah but that's got specific things on .
True.
"Yeah well all we did for Ormskirk was, it was just an O S map and we just drew a bloody great circle round it"

Everybody does it.
You're not on your own.
"I tell you summat  I'm getting fed up because every time I don't feel absolutely great, and I go over there and say will you stand in for me, I don't feel well, I don't want to."
"It was an arrangement we had I, I wouldn't phone in  cos you have to wait three weeks for your wages  if I phone in."
"So I says I wouldn't phone in, I'd let you know and you could do it and I'll pay you myself, I don't mind, you know, losing a day's pay."
I said I'll pay you mysen.
"So er  she says yeah fair enough then she won't have to wait three week, cos it's only me that's losing, not her."
Yeah.
Anyway she's been going out on and off for quite a while now.
So I thought well I don't have to wait three weeks for mine so  next time I don't feel great  I'm gonna call in and take a couple of days off.
According to them I have had four weeks off in ten years.
That's it.
That's all I've had off.
"No I'm lying, four weeks in nine years."
Why's she looking at excuses not to do it like?
Er apparently they phone her up or summat and ask her if she'll go and stand in for other people and she turned round and says if I can't have this school I'm not doing any.
That's what she's been doing.
So
It is.
"See a few of them, you know right at beginning where it shows you preface?"
Yeah.
"That's where it's jumped, not on the film itself."
"Yeah you know why, it's, it's because of cont continuous rewinding."
You always get damage at front of tape.
Best thing to do is just cut it off.
Ah we will do later cos
Well or yeah.
he uses  cuts it all off and gets rid of it.
"Yeah it's erm  any damage on tape, nine out of ten times i is the first foot  it's because when they wind them back i it, it's a jag"
tight innit?
complete jag all the time when they wind them back.
Yeah.
Aye well that doesn't bother us.
No.
Ta-ta.
Ta-ta love.
"shorts and  so I thought right, clean or mucky, you're in the wash."
"So , thought I'll get them all washed and put back in bedroom before he notices they're missing."
So that's what I did.
"Now what we're on about   yeah as I were on about, that er  what I do is, with days like this, cos you can never guarantee  if they're gonna be dry, wet or what, so I watch to see if it rains, if it don't  they're virtually dry when I fetch them in."
So that's what I've been doing.
I don't know whose T-shirt's whose.
That one's mine.
So that's what I've been doing.
"I fetch them all in, stick them on clothes horse, they're all round fire while I'm on lollipop and then nip to shop and when I come in within half an hour they were bone dry."
Easy.
That's one way to do it innit?
Fetch them in at half past three.
But if they're dry I just fold them up and put them away anyway.
I'm just transferring socks.
Never seen that.
Well they all have.
It's customary to go to work dressed in black or white or suits or
Not at all.
It's navy blue with flowered blouse they've got.
I've never seen it.
Each bank's different.
Well they've had them for years.
Well in the Midland Bank and they were wearing them the last time you were there.
The electric board wears them.
The gas board wears them.
Woolworths wear them.
Mm.
"And so really it is no different, just that they are making a song about it."
But there's no need to go to that prices.
a name on.
You can have the firm's name and give them a brooch or something.
"Well they've got them anyway, haven't they?"
But  Val was on about it last summer.
They was talking about it then.
But she said that they had been so many months  or when everybody else had a pay rise they only had a little bit.
And the extra that they should have had is going to pay for these uniforms.
Oh.
didn't want the uniforms.
Well a percentage is taken out of your money for them.
There's no doubt about that.
Mm.
"Well that's what she was on about that, and and they was  they were going"
Well everybody has got to do that.
to go on strike because of it.
"And really, it would be a good thing for Val."
Why?
Get it chopped up.
It's a great laugh!
Mm.
But we want one of those halogen jobs.
What are they called?
Hobs.
They are nice!
Mhm.
Not a bad price either.
What the halogen hobs?
Mm.
Oh you're joking!
About five hundred.
Not bad!
"You can't burn stuff on them either, can you?"
"On the halogen ones, no."
It's a
Exactly!
So that's a definite bonus!
"Well it wasn't, although they'd actually be going around burning ourselves anyway!"
"I do, you know those frying pans that you bought, the frying pans and saucepans?"
"An , you know the metal bit that's by the handle  that's a really poor safety device!"
Poor?
On the saucepans there's a metal rim  sort of piece at the end of the handle
Is there?
that that touches the actual saucepan
Yes.
when you pick that up you put your thumb on it!
I
And I burnt myself so many times on that!
Don't pick it up so close to the handle then!
Yeah but it's
Mm.
Yeah but they're like four interviews on a sheet and really sort of
Yeah.
But I mean who
"what, how w , what are w , have we got our current ones, our standard ones?"
Yeah.
Cos presumably it would be best to use those wouldn't it?
Yeah.
"I think  you could, you could accommodate it if you just reduced that sli the, what the normal one slightly, and there's t there's room to put the er translation on the top."
I'll do you a mock up of that and see what you
"Yes, good idea."
what you think.
I think either that or have it on a separate sheet.
But I would have thought it's best to put it on there if we can.
How many are we gonna want?
Three thousand?
Perhaps it's worth having a separate print run for that isn't it?
"Yeah, might be."
"It's not  I think if they use this offset thing, the masters last about five hundred so you're not  it's not, it's not a silly amount."
Yeah.
"Would it take, oh wait a minute!"
Three thousand interviews
What
"say, would you think three thousand interviews?"
I'm just trying to think what we were averaging.
But I mean that  one of them's not gonna  you're not gonna get as many  on that B road.
Will we  will we want those?
Oh I can't remember you know what we used for Ormskirk
It doesn't matter if we  if we get too many cos you can always use
Well that's it.
Can't you?
Yeah.
Oh aye.
No it's not as if you're all close is it?
No.
And I mean we haven't seen them since ours hardly have we?
No
Watch this fool.
Ram him off the road.
Oh I had a really good day today.
"I didn't go till about  half ten  ah no cos I had a few letters and stuff to write first  and I thought right I'll just take me time  and, cos I wanted to  I didn't wanna go faster than  you know than I should, I should have done sort of thing cos I wanted to time it properly."
Erm it took me an hour and a quarter.
And it's exactly sixty miles into the middle of Caernarvon.
So I
"And that's where the survey's gonna be, right in the middle is it?"
Well no but that's where I had to go.
See you can allow a few extra miles for getting
Oh.
to the others.
So you wanna allow yourself a  an hour and half really don't you?
"Do you think, or not?"
"Well I don't think so because that, I mean there won't be any traffic hardly"
No.
when I'm going so I'll just allow the same.
And then I should do it in an hour.
You know  I'll be leaving at about half five.
"No, not b about quarter past five I'll be leaving, five to quarter past."
That's allowing a  a good hour and a quarter.
But it's not gonna take me longer at that time of the morning than it has done today at eleven o'clock or so is it?
Coming home it took me a bit longer cos it was all that delay at the  hill.
Oh aye that's right I heard it on the radio.
Yeah oh it's pathetic .
"Oh no the rest of it, it's not too bad, it's not a bad journey, it's quite pleasant really."
So I went straight to the  county offices and saw the rooms you know where we're going to
Well that's daft innit?
"I says I don't, I says when am I gonna be able to go to town I says and afford fifteen quid for another bloody rail?"
I says you
When you've already got some up.
Yeah!
She wants me to take them down and swap them for one.
Steve'll go mad.
Yeah.
Bloody would an'all.
I thought you crafty sod.
"She wants them to extend to eight feet, well these don't extend to eight feet, they extend to seven."
Oh.
"And I thought no I'm not, Steve's just cleaned them up."
Yeah.
He spent about two hours in with them.
"Have you seen what he's done to ends of them, they've gone silvery, he's rubbed and rubbed and rubbed"
Rubbed too bloody hard .
and he's rubbed all colour off it.
They've got silver ends on them ones.
I said
I says can't you rub harder on other piece.
He ain't done them ones yet.
He's done these ones.
"Well they, are they not silvery then?"
Well he washed this one first and then he went over there and er then it dawned on him that the ends pull off
Ah!
"on ends, so he took the two ends off, cleaned the rails and he was sat on settee watching telly rubbing away and rubbing away and I says hey you gonna put them ends back on?"
And he'd been rubbing for that long they'd gone that colour.
Like my Steven with my new non-stick pans.
I remember.
He took all the black off.
He scrubbed and scrubbed till it all come off didn't he?
Victor says.
"And I thought like ah, and then mum sa I told mum, and she went you bastard, he told me that he gone and went to the hairdressers and done that."
"She went, right I'll get him, and I went, oh don't mum, I said, don't embarrass him."
"Do you know what she said, she went, what, I'm gonna bloody see that Victor."
"I went,no you're not  I said, don't do that, it's not nice, mum."
"I said, you wouldn't like it."
"She went, oh, she went oh I won't, I'll just wind him up."
"And Ryan came in  and she went oh, she went, I just learned who did er, your er little bit of hairstyling there Ryan."
"She went, he's pretty good with a pair clippers, ain't he, old Victor."
"Well, I went  ha ha ha   and she went, yes, I have heard, and he went, yeah, well, well, well, I mean, he just didn't how to spell my name."
"And she went, you wait,mu my mum went"
She gobbled him up with it.
Yeah.
"My mum went, you wait till I see Victor, she said, I'm gonna bloody have him."
"Right, see ya, what are you gonna do after"
"Erm, bye-bye"
you've finished?
I don't know.
I don't know.
"Well, we w"
What time do you finish?
"Well, we finish at nine, but er, might go up to the bar."
"Well, I tell you what, if you walk over to Annette's."
"If, if you want to go to the bar, walk over to Annette's after you've finished, because we probably won't go up until about nine, half nine, would we, and then we'll go up with ya."
"Well, we'll wait until you come round, and then decide what to do."
"okay,"
"Yeah, that's a good idea."
"And then you know, if you've coming back, I'll drop you back home."
Thank you.
Rather than walk back on your own.
thank you.
Have fun.
That's just it.
"If we're to be, if we end up being audited on that, then we will fail the audit because we do not do that."
That's what I'm saying.
That is supposed to say what we do and what I'm saying is
Yeah.
we don't do that.
I'm not saying we shouldn't do it I'm saying we don't do it.
Well I'll leave that for you to manage.
"And, and procedures procedures should not say what we don't do."
"I, I agree with you."
They should say what we do do.
Or .
Or what we ought to do.
Yes.
Oh no.
No.
No.
Ah!
If if we're not complying with the procedures that's a different
"Well it, I mean if we go down that"
a different ball game.
path er Jim then we're gonna have er five or six set different volumes of procedures.
Yes.
Because we all do things slightly different at present.
If that is necessary then that is of course what happened and indeed in many cases that is exactly what happened.
There is nothing wrong
You have a dif
with that.
"But, but, but"
you have a different quality system for different offices.
But Hughie is
"Well you, you have to do in some cases ."
"I know I used to be a selfish , thoughtless creature -- how selfish and thoughtless I am ashamed to remember now , so I ca n't be quite so bad as I was ."
`` I wish I could help Miranda .
It would be very romantic to contrive a war-wedding and I should dearly love to get the better of Whiskers-on-the-moon .
But at present the oracle has not spoken . ''
"CHAPTER XVIII A WAR-WEDDING `` I can tell you this Dr. dear , '' said Susan , pale with wrath , `` that Germany is getting to be perfectly ridiculous . ''"
They were all in the big Ingleside kitchen .
Susan was mixing biscuits for supper .
"Mrs. Blythe was making shortbread for Jem , and Rilla was compounding candy for Ken and Walter -- it had once been `` Walter and Ken '' in her thoughts but somehow , quite unconsciously , this had changed until Ken 's name came naturally first ."
"Cousin Sophia was also there , knitting ."
"All the boys were going to be killed in the long run , so Cousin Sophia felt in her bones , but they might better die with warm feet than cold ones , so Cousin Sophia knitted faithfully and gloomily ."
"Into this peaceful scene erupted the doctor , wrathful and excited over the burning of the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa ."
And Susan became automatically quite as wrathful and excited .
`` What will those Huns do next ? ''
she demanded .
`` Coming over here and burning our Parliament building !
Did anyone ever hear of such an outrage ? ''
"`` We do n't know that the Germans are responsible for this , '' said the doctor -- much as if he felt quite sure they were ."
`` Fires do start without their agency sometimes .
And Uncle Mark MacAllister 's barn was burnt last week .
"You can hardly accuse the Germans of that , Susan . ''"
"`` Indeed , Dr. dear , I do not know . ''"
Susan nodded slowly and portentously .
`` Whiskers-on-the-moon was there that very day .
The fire broke out half an hour after he was gone .
So much is a fact -- but I shall not accuse a Presbyterian elder of burning anybody 's barn until I have proof .
"However , everybody knows , Dr. dear , that both Uncle Mark 's boys have enlisted , and that Uncle Mark himself makes speeches at all the recruiting meetings ."
So no doubt Germany is anxious to get square with him . ''
"`` I could never speak at a recruiting meeting , '' said Cousin Sophia solemnly ."
"`` I could never reconcile it to my conscience to ask another woman 's son to go , to murder and be murdered . ''"
`` Could you not ? ''
said Susan .
"`` Well , Sophia Crawford , I felt as if I could ask anyone to go when I read last night that there were no children under eight years of age left alive in Poland ."
"`` It 's as sweet as yourself , dear child , '' she said tenderly ."
`` And it will be a joy to me all through the lonely winter days .
"You 've found out the best meaning of Christmas giving , have n't you , dear ? ''"
"`` Yes , thanks to you , Aunt Emmy , '' said Clorinda softly ."
"Cyrilla 's Inspiration It was a rainy Saturday afternoon and all the boarders at Mrs. Plunkett 's were feeling dull and stupid , especially the Normal School girls on the third floor , Cyrilla Blair and Carol Hart and Mary Newton , who were known as The Trio , and shared the big front room together ."
"They were sitting in that front room , scowling out at the weather ."
"At least , Carol and Mary were scowling ."
"Cyrilla never scowled ; she was sitting curled up on her bed with her Greek grammar , and she smiled at the rain and her grumbling chums as cheerfully as possible ."
"`` For pity 's sake , Cyrilla , put that grammar away , '' moaned Mary ."
"`` There is something positively uncanny about a girl who can study Greek on Saturday afternoons -- at least , this early in the term . ''"
"`` I 'm not really studying , '' said Cyrilla , tossing the book away ."
`` I 'm only pretending to .
I 'm really just as bored and lonesome as you are .
But what else is there to do ?
We ca n't stir outside the door ; we 've nothing to read ; we ca n't make candy since Mrs. Plunkett has forbidden us to use the oil stove in our room ; we 'll probably quarrel all round if we sit here in idleness ; so I 've been trying to brush up my Greek verbs by way of keeping out of mischief .
Have you any better employment to offer me ? ''
"`` If it were only a mild drizzle we might go around and see the Patterson girls , '' sighed Carol ."
`` But there is no venturing out in such a downpour .
"Cyrilla , you are supposed to be the brainiest one of us ."
"Prove your claim to such pre-eminence by thinking of some brand-new amusement , especially suited to rainy afternoons ."
That will be putting your grey matter to better use than squandering it on Greek verbs out of study limits . ''
"`` If only I 'd got a letter from home today , '' said Mary , who seemed determined to persist in gloom ."
`` I would n't mind the weather .
Letters are such cheery things : -- especially the letters my sister writes .
They 're so full of fun and nice little news .
The reading of one cheers me up for the day .
"Cyrilla Blair , what is the matter ?"
You nearly frightened me to death ! ''
"Cyrilla had bounded from her bed to the centre of the floor , waving her Greek grammar wildly in the air ."
"`` Girls , I have an inspiration ! ''"
she exclaimed .
`` Good !
That is a pill for the Turks .
I wish I had a chance to tell the Czar just what a mistake he made when he turned Nicholas down . ''
"Susan disappeared downstairs to the kitchen , whence a dreadful thud and a piercing shriek presently sounded ."
"Everybody rushed to the kitchen -- the doctor and Miss Oliver , Mrs. Blythe , Rilla , Miranda in her wedding-veil ."
"Susan was sitting flatly in the middle of the kitchen floor with a dazed , bewildered look on her face , while Doc , evidently in his Hyde incarnation , was standing on the dresser , with his back up , his eyes blazing , and his tail the size of three tails ."
"`` Susan , what has happened ? ''"
cried Mrs. Blythe in alarm .
`` Did you fall ?
Are you hurt ? ''
Susan picked herself up .
"`` No , '' she said grimly , `` I am not hurt , though I am jarred all over ."
Do not be alarmed .
"As for what has happened -- I tried to kick that darned cat with both feet , that is what happened . ''"
Everybody shrieked with laughter .
The doctor was quite helpless .
"`` Oh , Susan , Susan , '' he gasped ."
`` That I should live to hear you swear . ''
"`` I am sorry , '' said Susan in real distress , `` that I used such an expression before two young girls ."
"But I said that beast was darned , and darned it is ."
It belongs to Old Nick . ''
"`` Do you expect it will vanish some of these days with a bang and the odour of brimstone , Susan ? ''"
"`` It will go to its own place in due time and that you may tie to , '' said Susan dourly , shaking out her raddled bones and going to her oven ."
`` I suppose my plunking down like that has shaken my cake so that it will be as heavy as lead . ''
But the cake was not heavy .
"It was all a bride 's cake should be , and Susan iced it beautifully ."
"Next day she and Rilla worked all the forenoon , making delicacies for the wedding-feast , and as soon as Miranda phoned up that her father was safely off everything was packed in a big hamper and taken down to the Pryor house ."
"Joe soon arrived in his uniform and a state of violent excitement , accompanied by his best man , Sergeant Malcolm Crawford ."
"There were quite a few guests , for all the Manse and Ingleside folk were there , and a dozen or so of Joe 's relatives , including his mother , `` Mrs. Dead Angus Milgrave , '' so called , cheerfully , to distinguish her from another lady whose Angus was living ."
"Mrs. Dead Angus wore a rather disapproving expression , not caring over-much for this alliance with the house of Whiskers-on-the-moon ."
So Miranda Pryor was married to Private Joseph Milgrave on his last leave .
It should have been a romantic wedding but it was not .
"There were too many factors working against romance , as even Rilla had to admit ."
"`` Captain , '' said the squire , `` the house is quite invisible from the ship ."
It must be the flag they are aiming at .
Would it not be wiser to take it in ? ''
`` Strike my colours ! ''
cried the captain .
"`` No , sir , not I '' ; and as soon as he had said the words , I think we all agreed with him ."
"For it was not only a piece of stout , seamanly , good feeling ; it was good policy besides and showed our enemies that we despised their cannonade ."
All through the evening they kept thundering away .
"Ball after ball flew over or fell short or kicked up the sand in the enclosure , but they had to fire so high that the shot fell dead and buried itself in the soft sand ."
"We had no ricochet to fear , and though one popped in through the roof of the log-house and out again through the floor , we soon got used to that sort of horse-play and minded it no more than cricket ."
"`` There is one good thing about all this , '' observed the captain ; `` the wood in front of us is likely clear ."
The ebb has made a good while ; our stores should be uncovered .
Volunteers to go and bring in pork . ''
Gray and Hunter were the first to come forward .
"Well armed , they stole out of the stockade , but it proved a useless mission ."
The mutineers were bolder than we fancied or they put more trust in Israel 's gunnery .
"For four or five of them were busy carrying off our stores and wading out with them to one of the gigs that lay close by , pulling an oar or so to hold her steady against the current ."
Silver was in the stern-sheets in command ; and every man of them was now provided with a musket from some secret magazine of their own .
"The captain sat down to his log , and here is the beginning of the entry : Alexander Smollett , master ; David Livesey , ship 's doctor ; Abraham Gray , carpenter 's mate ; John Trelawney , owner ; John Hunter and Richard Joyce , owner 's servants , landsmen -- being all that is left faithful of the ship 's company -- with stores for ten days at short rations , came ashore this day and flew British colours on the log-house in Treasure Island ."
"Thomas Redruth , owner 's servant , landsman , shot by the mutineers ; James Hawkins , cabin-boy -- And at the same time , I was wondering over poor Jim Hawkins ' fate ."
A hail on the land side .
"`` Somebody hailing us , '' said Hunter , who was on guard ."
`` Doctor !
Squire !
Captain !
"Hullo , Hunter , is that you ? ''"
came the cries .
"And I ran to the door in time to see Jim Hawkins , safe and sound , come climbing over the stockade ."
"19 Narrative Resumed by Jim Hawkins : The Garrison in the Stockade AS soon as Ben Gunn saw the colours he came to a halt , stopped me by the arm , and sat down ."
"`` Now , '' said he , `` there 's your friends , sure enough . ''"
"`` Far more likely it 's the mutineers , '' I answered ."
`` That ! ''
"`` I will get up at sunrise every morning of my life hereafter , '' exclaimed Murray rapturously , not meaning a syllable of it , but devoutly believing he did ."
Just as the fiery disc of the sun peered over the sand dunes Murray heard music that was not of the birds .
"It was a girl 's voice singing beyond the maples to his left -- a clear sweet voice , blithely trilling out the old-fashioned song , `` Five O'Clock in the Morning . ''"
`` Mrs. Palmer 's niece ! ''
Murray sprang to his feet and tiptoed cautiously through the maples .
He had heard so much from Mrs. Palmer about her niece that he felt reasonably well acquainted with her .
"Moreover , Mrs. Palmer had assured him that Mollie was a very pretty girl ."
Now a pretty girl milking cows at sunrise in the meadows sounded well .
Mrs. Palmer had not over-rated her niece 's beauty .
Murray said so to himself with a little whistle of amazement as he leaned unseen on the pasture fence and looked at the girl who was milking a placid Jersey less than ten yards away from him .
Murray 's artistic instinct responded to the whole scene with a thrill of satisfaction .
"He could see only her profile , but that was perfect , and the colouring of the oval cheek and the beautiful curve of the chin were something to adore ."
"Her hair , ruffled into lovable little ringlets by the morning wind , was coiled in glistening chestnut masses high on her bare head , and her arms , bare to the elbow , were as white as marble ."
"Presently she began to sing again , and this time Murray joined in ."
She half rose from her milking stool and cast a startled glance at the maples .
"Then she dropped back again and began to milk determinedly , but Murray could have sworn that he saw a demure smile hovering about her lips ."
"That , and the revelation of her full face , decided him ."
He sprang over the fence and sauntered across the intervening space of lush clover blossoms .
"`` Good morning , '' he said coolly ."
"He had forgotten her other name , and it did not matter ; at five o'clock in the morning people who met in dewy clover fields might disregard the conventionalities ."
`` Is n't it rather a large contract for you to be milking seven cows all alone ?
May I help you ? ''
Mollie looked up at him over her shoulder .
She had glorious grey eyes .
Her face was serene and undisturbed .
`` Can you milk ? ''
she asked .
"`` Unlikely as it may seem , I can , '' said Murray ."
"`` I have never confessed it to Mrs. Emory , because I was afraid she would inveigle me into milking her fourteen cows ."
But I do n't mind helping you .
I learned to milk when I was a shaver on my vacations at a grandfatherly farm .
May I have that extra pail ? ''
"Ragged , dirty , thin , and worn-out he looked ; one foot was bare , the other tied up in the old gingham jacket which he had taken from his own back to use as a clumsy bandage for some hurt ."
"He seemed to have hidden himself behind the hay-cock , but in his sleep had thrown out the arm that had betrayed him ."
"He sighed and muttered as if his dreams disturbed him , and once when he moved , he groaned as if in pain , but still slept on quite spent with weariness ."
"`` He must not lie here , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , and stooping over him she gently called his name ."
"He opened his eyes and looked at her , as if she was a part of his dream , for he smiled and said drowsily , `` Mother Bhaer , I 've come home . ''"
"The look , the words , touched her very much , and she put her hand under his head to lift him up , saying in her cordial way , `` I thought you would , and I 'm so glad to see you , Dan . ''"
"He seemed to wake thoroughly then , and started up looking about him as if he suddenly remembered where he was , and doubted even that kind welcome ."
"His face changed , and he said in his old rough way , `` I was going off in the morning ."
"I only stopped to peek in , as I went by . ''"
"`` But why not come in , Dan ?"
Did n't you hear us call you ?
"Teddy saw , and cried for you . ''"
"`` Did n't suppose you 'd let me in , '' he said , fumbling with a little bundle which he had taken up as if going immediately ."
"`` Try and see , '' was all Mrs. Bhaer answered , holding out her hand and pointing to the door , where the light shone hospitably ."
"With a long breath , as if a load was off his mind , Dan took up a stout stick , and began to limp towards the house , but stopped suddenly , to say inquiringly , `` Mr. Bhaer wo n't like it ."
I ran away from Page . ''
"`` He knows it , and was sorry , but it will make no difference ."
Are you lame ? ''
"asked Mrs. Jo , as he limped on again ."
`` Getting over a wall a stone fell on my foot and smashed it .
"I do n't mind , '' and he did his best to hide the pain each step cost him ."
"Mrs. Bhaer helped him into her own room , and , once there , he dropped into a chair , and laid his head back , white and faint with weariness and suffering ."
`` My poor Dan !
"drink this , and then eat a little ; you are at home now , and Mother Bhaer will take good care of you . ''"
"He only looked up at her with eyes full of gratitude , as he drank the wine she held to his lips , and then began slowly to eat the food she brought him ."
"Each mouthful seemed to put heart into him , and presently he began to talk as if anxious to have her know all about him ."
"`` Where have you been , Dan ? ''"
"she asked , beginning to get out some bandages ."
`` I ran off more 'n a month ago .
"Page was good enough , but too strict ."
"I did n't like it , so I cut away down the river with a man who was going in his boat ."
That 's why they could n't tell where I 'd gone .
"As we went , he stopped and spoke with all the wayfarers and workers that we met or passed ; and though of course I could not tell what they discoursed about , yet I judged Mr. Henderland must be well liked in the countryside , for I observed many of them to bring out their mulls and share a pinch of snuff with him ."
"I told him as far in my affairs as I judged wise ; as far , that is , as they were none of Alan 's ; and gave Balachulish as the place I was travelling to , to meet a friend ; for I thought Aucharn , or even Duror , would be too particular , and might put him on the scent ."
"On his part , he told me much of his work and the people he worked among , the hiding priests and Jacobites , the Disarming Act , the dress , and many other curiosities of the time and place ."
"He seemed moderate ; blaming Parliament in several points , and especially because they had framed the Act more severely against those who wore the dress than against those who carried weapons ."
"This moderation put it in my mind to question him of the Red Fox and the Appin tenants ; questions which , I thought , would seem natural enough in the mouth of one travelling to that country ."
He said it was a bad business .
"`` It 's wonderful , '' said he , `` where the tenants find the money , for their life is mere starvation ."
"-LRB- Ye do n't carry such a thing as snuff , do ye , Mr. Balfour ?"
No .
"Well , I 'm better wanting it . -RRB-"
But these tenants -LRB- as I was saying -RRB- are doubtless partly driven to it .
"James Stewart in Duror -LRB- that 's him they call James of the Glens -RRB- is half-brother to Ardshiel , the captain of the clan ; and he is a man much looked up to , and drives very hard ."
And then there 's one they call Alan Breck -- '' `` Ah ! ''
"I cried , `` what of him ? ''"
`` What of the wind that bloweth where it listeth ? ''
said Henderland .
`` He 's here and awa ; here to-day and gone to-morrow : a fair heather-cat .
"He might be glowering at the two of us out of yon whin-bush , and I wouldnae wonder !"
"Ye 'll no carry such a thing as snuff , will ye ? ''"
"I told him no , and that he had asked the same thing more than once ."
"`` It 's highly possible , '' said he , sighing ."
`` But it seems strange ye shouldnae carry it .
"However , as I was saying , this Alan Breck is a bold , desperate customer , and well kent to be James 's right hand ."
"His life is forfeit already ; he would boggle at naething ; and maybe , if a tenant-body was to hang back he would get a dirk in his wame . ''"
"`` You make a poor story of it all , Mr. Henderland , '' said I. `` If it is all fear upon both sides , I care to hear no more of it . ''"
"`` Na , '' said Mr. Henderland , `` but there 's love too , and self-denial that should put the like of you and me to shame ."
"There 's something fine about it ; no perhaps Christian , but humanly fine ."
"Even Alan Breck , by all that I hear , is a chield to be respected ."
"There 's many a lying sneck-draw sits close in kirk in our own part of the country , and stands well in the world 's eye , and maybe is a far worse man , Mr. Balfour , than yon misguided shedder of man 's blood ."
"Ay , ay , we might take a lesson by them ."
-- Ye 'll perhaps think I 've been too long in the Hielands ? ''
"he added , smiling to me ."
"`` It may be what it will , '' returned Dick ; `` and it must be as heaven please ."
"Reck we not a jot , but push on the livelier , and put it to the touch ."
"Up , friends -- enough breathed . ''"
"As they advanced , the snow became more and more trampled with hoof-marks , and it was plain that they were drawing near to the encampment of a considerable force of mounted men ."
"Presently they could see the smoke pouring from among the trees , ruddily coloured on its lower edge and scattering bright sparks ."
"And here , pursuant to Dick 's orders , his men began to open out , creeping stealthily in the covert , to surround on every side the camp of their opponents ."
"He himself , placing Alicia in the shelter of a bulky oak , stole straight forth in the direction of the fire ."
"At last , through an opening of the wood , his eye embraced the scene of the encampment ."
"The fire had been built upon a heathy hummock of the ground , surrounded on three sides by thicket , and it now burned very strong , roaring aloud and brandishing flames ."
"Around it there sat not quite a dozen people , warmly cloaked ; but though the neighbouring snow was trampled down as by a regiment , Dick looked in vain for any horse ."
He began to have a terrible misgiving that he was out-manoeuvred .
"At the same time , in a tall man with a steel salet , who was spreading his hands before the blaze , he recognised his old friend and still kindly enemy , Bennet Hatch ; and in two others , sitting a little back , he made out , even in their male disguise , Joanna Sedley and Sir Daniel 's wife ."
"`` Well , '' thought he to himself , `` even if I lose my horses , let me get my Joanna , and why should I complain ? ''"
"And then , from the further side of the encampment , there came a little whistle , announcing that his men had joined , and the investment was complete ."
"Bennet , at the sound , started to his feet ; but ere he had time to spring upon his arms , Dick hailed him ."
"`` Bennet , '' he said -- `` Bennet , old friend , yield ye ."
"Ye will but spill men 's lives in vain , if ye resist . '' ''"
"'T is Master Shelton , by St. Barbary ! ''"
cried Hatch .
`` Yield me ?
Ye ask much .
What force have ye ? ''
"`` I tell you , Bennet , ye are both outnumbered and begirt , '' said Dick ."
`` Caesar and Charlemagne would cry for quarter .
"I have two score men at my whistle , and with one shoot of arrows I could answer for you all . ''"
"`` Master Dick , '' said Bennet , `` it goes against my heart ; but I must do my duty ."
The saints help you ! ''
And therewith he raised a little tucket to his mouth and wound a rousing call .
"Then followed a moment of confusion ; for while Dick , fearing for the ladies , still hesitated to give the word to shoot , Hatch 's little band sprang to their weapons and formed back to back as for a fierce resistance ."
"In the hurry of their change of place , Joanna sprang from her seat and ran like an arrow to her lover 's side ."
"`` Here , Dick ! ''"
"she cried , as she clasped his hand in hers ."
did he ?
I declare I should n't wonder !
It would be just like the dear old blunder-head . ''
"`` I never thought of it till you told me where Bob was , and then it all sort of burst upon me in one minute ! ''"
"cried Jill , waving her arms about to express the intellectual explosion which had thrown light upon the mystery , like sky-rockets in a dark night ."
`` You are as bright as a button .
"No time to lose ; I 'm off ; '' and off he was , splashing through the mud to post the letter , on the back of which he added , to make the thing sure , `` Hurry up ."
"F.M. '' Both felt rather guilty next day , but enjoyed themselves very much nevertheless , and kept chuckling over the mine they were making under Jack 's unconscious feet ."
"They hardly expected an answer at noon , as the Hill people were not very eager for their mail , but at night Jill was sure of a letter , and to her great delight it came ."
"Jack brought it himself , which added to the fun , and while she eagerly read it he sat calmly poring over the latest number of his own private and particular `` Youth 's Companion . ''"
"Bob was not a `` complete letter-writer '' by any means , and with great labor and much ink had produced the following brief but highly satisfactory epistle ."
"Not knowing how to address his fair correspondent he let it alone , and went at once to the point in the frankest possible way : -- `` Jack did come up Friday ."
Sorry he got into a mess .
"It was real kind of him , and I shall pay him back soon ."
Jack paid Jerry for me and I made him promise not to tell .
Jerry said he 'd come here and make a row if I did n't cash up .
"I was afraid I 'd lose the place if he did , for the Capt. is awful strict ."
"If Jack do n't tell now , I will ."
I ai n't mean .
Glad you wrote .
`` R.O.W. '' `` Hurrah ! ''
"cried Jill , waving the letter over her head in great triumph ."
"`` Call everybody and read it out , '' she added , as Frank snatched it , and ran for his mother , seeing at a glance that the news was good ."
"Jill was so afraid she should tell before the others came that she burst out singing `` Pretty Bobby Shafto '' at the top of her voice , to Jack 's great disgust , for he considered the song very personal , as he was rather fond of `` combing down his yellow hair , '' and Jill often plagued him by singing it when he came in with the golden quirls very smooth and nice to hide the scar on his forehead ."
"In about five minutes the door flew open and in came Mamma , making straight for bewildered Jack , who thought the family had gone crazy when his parent caught him in her arms , saying tenderly , -- `` My good , generous boy !"
I knew he was right all the time ! ''
"while Frank worked his hand up and down like a pump-handle , exclaiming heartily , -- `` You 're a trump , sir , and I 'm proud of you ! ''"
"Jill meantime calling out , in wild delight , -- `` I told you so !"
I told you so !
"I did find out ; ha , ha , I did ! ''"
"`` Come , I say !"
What 's the matter ?
He would have elected to bear any suffering if by so doing he could have freed her from the nightmare dread of Harmon 's returning to claim her .
That dread had always hung over her and now it must be intensified to agony by her love for another man .
And he could do nothing -- nothing .
He groaned aloud in his helplessness .
One evening in late November Alan flung aside his pen and yielded to the impulse that urged him to the lake shore .
He did not mean to seek Lynde -- he would go to a part of the shore where there would be no likelihood of meeting her .
But get away by himself he must .
A November storm was raging and there would be a certain satisfaction in breasting its buffets and fighting his way through it .
"Besides , he knew that Isabel King was in the house and he dreaded meeting her ."
"Since his conviction that she had written that letter to Lynde , he could not tolerate the girl and it tasked his self-control to keep from showing his contempt openly ."
Perhaps Isabel felt it beneath all his outward courtesy .
At least she did not seek his society as she had formerly done .
It was the second day of the storm ; a wild northeast gale was blowing and cold rain and freezing sleet fell in frequent showers .
Alan shivered as he came out into its full fury on the lake shore .
At first he could not see the water through the driving mist .
"Then it cleared away for a moment and he stopped short , aghast at the sight which met his eyes ."
"Opposite him was a long low island known as Philip 's Point , dwindling down at its northeastern side to two long narrow bars of quicksand ."
Alan 's horrified eyes saw a small schooner sunk between the bars ; her hull was entirely under water and in the rigging clung one solitary figure .
So much he saw before the Point was blotted out in a renewed downpour of sleet .
"Without a moment 's hesitation Alan turned and ran for Four Winds , which was only about a quarter of a mile away around a headland ."
"With the Captain 's assistance , something might be done ."
Other help could not be obtained before darkness would fall and then it would be impossible to do anything .
"He dashed up the steps of Four Winds and met Emily , who had flung the door open ."
Behind her was Lynde 's pale face with its alarmed questioning eyes .
`` Where is the Captain ? ''
gasped Alan .
`` There 's a vessel on Philip 's Point and one man at least on her . ''
"`` The Captain 's away on a cruise , '' said Emily blankly ."
`` He went three days ago . ''
"`` Then nothing can be done , '' said Alan despairingly ."
`` It will be dark long before I can get to the village . ''
"Lynde stepped out , tying a shawl around her head ."
"There 's nothing to do , child , except go and see Mr. Harrison about it ."
We can offer him our Jersey in exchange if he does n't want to take the money .
She is just as good as his . ''
"`` I 'm sure he 'll be awfully cross and disagreeable about it , though , '' moaned Anne ."
`` I daresay he will .
He seems to be an irritable sort of a man .
I 'll go and explain to him if you like . ''
"`` No , indeed , I 'm not as mean as that , '' exclaimed Anne ."
`` This is all my fault and I 'm certainly not going to let you take my punishment .
I 'll go myself and I 'll go at once .
"The sooner it 's over the better , for it will be terribly humiliating . ''"
Poor Anne got her hat and her twenty dollars and was passing out when she happened to glance through the open pantry door .
On the table reposed a nut cake which she had baked that morning ... a particularly toothsome concoction iced with pink icing and adorned with walnuts .
"Anne had intended it for Friday evening , when the youth of Avonlea were to meet at Green Gables to organize the Improvement Society ."
But what were they compared to the justly offended Mr. Harrison ?
"Anne thought that cake ought to soften the heart of any man , especially one who had to do his own cooking , and she promptly popped it into a box ."
She would take it to Mr. Harrison as a peace offering .
"`` That is , if he gives me a chance to say anything at all , '' she thought ruefully , as she climbed the lane fence and started on a short cut across the fields , golden in the light of the dreamy August evening ."
`` I know now just how people feel who are being led to execution . ''
"III Mr. Harrison at Home Mr. Harrison 's house was an old-fashioned , low-eaved , whitewashed structure , set against a thick spruce grove ."
"Mr. Harrison himself was sitting on his vineshaded veranda , in his shirt sleeves , enjoying his evening pipe ."
"When he realized who was coming up the path he sprang suddenly to his feet , bolted into the house , and shut the door ."
"This was merely the uncomfortable result of his surprise , mingled with a good deal of shame over his outburst of temper the day before ."
But it nearly swept the remnant of her courage from Anne 's heart .
"`` If he 's so cross now what will he be when he hears what I 've done , '' she reflected miserably , as she rapped at the door ."
"But Mr. Harrison opened it , smiling sheepishly , and invited her to enter in a tone quite mild and friendly , if somewhat nervous ."
"He had laid aside his pipe and donned his coat ; he offered Anne a very dusty chair very politely , and her reception would have passed off pleasantly enough if it had not been for the telltale of a parrot who was peering through the bars of his cage with wicked golden eyes ."
"No sooner had Anne seated herself than Ginger exclaimed , `` Bless my soul , what 's that redheaded snippet coming here for ? ''"
"It would be hard to say whose face was the redder , Mr. Harrison 's or Anne 's ."
"`` Do n't you mind that parrot , '' said Mr. Harrison , casting a furious glance at Ginger ."
`` He 's ... he 's always talking nonsense .
I got him from my brother who was a sailor .
`` And I wish I did n't have to go to sleep .
"It is hideous to go to sleep and forget it for a little while , and wake up and have it all rush over me anew the next morning ."
"Do people ever get used to things like this , Susan ?"
"And oh , Susan , I ca n't get away from what Mrs. Reese said ."
Did Walter suffer much -- he was always so sensitive to pain .
"Oh , Susan , if I knew that he did n't I think I could gather up a little courage and strength . ''"
This merciful knowledge was given to Rilla .
"A letter came from Walter 's commanding officer , telling them that he had been killed instantly by a bullet during a charge at Courcelette ."
The same day there was a letter for Rilla from Walter himself .
"Rilla carried it unopened to Rainbow Valley and read it there , in the spot where she had had her last talk with him ."
"It is a strange thing to read a letter after the writer is dead -- a bitter-sweet thing , in which pain and comfort are strangely mingled ."
"For the first time since the blow had fallen Rilla felt -- a different thing from tremulous hope and faith -- that Walter , of the glorious gift and the splendid ideals , still lived , with just the same gift and just the same ideals ."
That could not be destroyed -- these could suffer no eclipse .
"The personality that had expressed itself in that last letter , written on the eve of Courcelette , could not be snuffed out by a German bullet ."
"It must carry on , though the earthly link with things of earth were broken ."
"`` We 're going over the top tomorrow , Rilla-my-Rilla , '' wrote Walter ."
"`` I wrote mother and Di yesterday , but somehow I feel as if I must write you tonight ."
I had n't intended to do any writing tonight -- but I 've got to .
"Do you remember old Mrs. Tom Crawford over-harbour , who was always saying that it was ` laid on her ' to do such and such a thing ?"
"Well , that is just how I feel ."
"It 's ` laid on me ' to write you tonight -- you , sister and chum of mine ."
"There are some things I want to say before -- well , before tomorrow ."
`` You and Ingleside seem strangely near me tonight .
It 's the first time I 've felt this since I came .
Always home has seemed so far away -- so hopelessly far away from this hideous welter of filth and blood .
But tonight it is quite close to me -- it seems to me I can almost see you -- hear you speak .
And I can see the moonlight shining white and still on the old hills of home .
It has seemed to me ever since I came here that it was impossible that there could be calm gentle nights and unshattered moonlight anywhere in the world .
"But tonight somehow , all the beautiful things I have always loved seem to have become possible again -- and this is good , and makes me feel a deep , certain , exquisite happiness ."
"It must be autumn at home now -- the harbour is a-dream and the old Glen hills blue with haze , and Rainbow Valley a haunt of delight with wild asters blowing all over it -- our old `` farewell-summers . ''"
I always liked that name better than ` aster ' -- it was a poem in itself .
"`` Rilla , you know I 've always had premonitions ."
`` Mostly .
"Rather a neat job , I flatter myself . ''"
`` I should say so .
What a clever fellow you are !
Any new inventions lately ? ''
"asked Frank , coming up to examine and admire ."
"`` Only an anti-snoring machine and an elbow-pad , '' answered Ralph , with a twinkle in his eye , as if reminded of something funny ."
"`` Go on , and tell about them ."
I never heard of an anti-snorer .
"Jack better have one , '' said Frank , interested at once ."
"`` Well , a rich old lady kept her family awake with that lively music , so she sent to Shirtman and Codleff for something to stop it ."
"They thought it was a good joke , and told me to see what I could do ."
"I thought it over , and got up the nicest little affair you ever saw ."
"It went over the mouth , and had a tube to fit the ear , so when the lady snored she woke herself up and stopped it ."
It suited exactly .
"I think of taking out a patent , '' concluded Ralph , joining in the boys ' laugh at the droll idea ."
`` What was the pad ? ''
"asked Frank , returning to the small model of an engine he was making ."
"`` Oh , that was a mere trifle for a man who had a tender elbow-joint and wanted something to protect it ."
"I made a little pad to fit on , and his crazy-bone was safe . ''"
"`` I planned to have you make me a new leg if this one was spoilt , '' said Jack , sure that his friend could invent anything under the sun ."
`` I 'd do my best for you .
"I made a hand for a fellow once , and that got me my place , you know , '' answered Ralph , who thought little of such mechanical trifles , and longed to be painting portraits or modelling busts , being an artist as well as an inventor ."
"Here Gus , Ed , and several other boys came in , and the conversation became general ."
"Grif , Chick , and Brickbat were three young gentlemen whose own respectable names were usually ignored , and they cheerfully answered to these nicknames ."
"As the clock struck seven , Frank , who ruled the club with a rod of iron when Chairman , took his place behind the study table ."
"Seats stood about it , and a large , shabby book lay before Gus , who was Secretary , and kept the records with a lavish expenditure of ink , to judge by the blots ."
"The members took their seats , and nearly all tilted back their chairs and put their hands in their pockets , to keep them out of mischief ; for , as every one knows , it is impossible for two lads to be near each other and refrain from tickling or pinching ."
"Frank gave three raps with an old croquet-mallet set on a short handle , and with much dignity opened the meeting ."
"`` Gentlemen , the business of the club will be attended to , and then we will discuss the question , ` Shall girls go to our colleges ? '"
The Secretary will now read the report of the last meeting . ''
"Clearing his throat , Gus read the following brief and elegant report : -- `` Club met , December 18th , at the house of G. Burton , Esq. ."
Make it up to him -- show him but this chance to become wealthy -- and I will go pledge he will forgive you . ''
"So far Dick had spoken pretty much at random ; but it was now necessary , under the supervision of six eyes , to invent and tell some marvellous story , and , if it were possible , get back into his hands the all-important signet ."
To squander time was the first necessity .
"The longer his stay lasted , the more would his captors drink , and the surer should he be when he attempted his escape ."
"Well , Dick was not much of an inventor , and what he told was pretty much the tale of Ali Baba , with Shoreby and Tunstall Forest substituted for the East , and the treasures of the cavern rather exaggerated than diminished ."
"As the reader is aware , it is an excellent story , and has but one drawback -- that it is not true ; and so , as these three simple shipmen now heard it for the first time , their eyes stood out of their faces , and their mouths gaped like codfish at a fishmonger 's ."
Pretty soon a second measure of mulled ale was called for ; and while Dick was still artfully spinning out the incidents a third followed the second .
"Here was the position of the parties towards the end : Arblaster , three-parts drunk and one-half asleep , hung helpless on his stool ."
"Even Tom had been much delighted with the tale , and his vigilance had abated in proportion ."
"Meanwhile , Dick had gradually wormed his right arm clear of its bonds , and was ready to risk all ."
"`` And so , '' said Pirret , `` y ' are one of these ? ''"
"`` I was made so , '' replied Dick , `` against my will ; but an I could but get a sack or two of gold coin to my share , I should be a fool indeed to continue dwelling in a filthy cave , and standing shot and buffet like a soldier ."
Here be we four ; good !
"Let us , then , go forth into the forest to-morrow ere the sun be up ."
"Could we come honestly by a donkey , it were better ; but an we can not , we have our four strong backs , and I warrant me we shall come home staggering . ''"
Pirret licked his lips .
"`` And this magic , '' he said -- `` this password , whereby the cave is opened -- how call ye it , friend ? ''"
"`` Nay , none know the word but the three chiefs , '' returned Dick ; `` but here is your great good fortune , that , on this very evening , I should be the bearer of a spell to open it ."
It is a thing not trusted twice a year beyond the captain 's wallet . ''
`` A spell ! ''
"said Arblaster , half awakening , and squinting upon Dick with one eye ."
`` Aroint thee !
no spells !
I be a good Christian .
"Ask my man Tom , else . ''"
"`` Nay , but this is white magic , '' said Dick ."
"`` It doth naught with the devil ; only the powers of numbers , herbs , and planets . ''"
"`` Ay , ay , '' said Pirret ; '' 't is but white magic , gossip ."
"There is no sin therein , I do assure you ."
"But proceed , good youth ."
This spell -- in what should it consist ? ''
"`` Nay , that I will incontinently show you , '' answered Dick ."
`` No snow . ''
"`` Lawn to rake , then ? ''"
`` Not time for that yet . ''
`` Catalogue of books ? ''
`` Frank got that job . ''
`` Copy those letters for your mother ? ''
`` Take me too long .
"Must have my money Friday , if possible . ''"
"`` I do n't see what we can do , then ."
"It is too early or too late for everything , and you wo n't borrow . ''"
`` Not of you .
"No , nor of any one else , if I can possibly help it ."
"I 've promised to do this myself , and I will ; '' and Jack wagged his head resolutely ."
`` Could n't you do something with the printing-press ?
"Do me some cards , and then , perhaps , the other girls will want some , '' said Jill , as a forlorn hope ."
`` Just the thing !
What a goose I was not to think of it .
I 'll rig the old machine up at once . ''
"And , starting from his seat , Jack dived into the big closet , dragged out the little press , and fell to oiling , dusting , and putting it in order , like one relieved of a great anxiety ."
"`` Give me the types ; I 'll sort them and set up my name , so you can begin as soon as you are ready ."
You know what a help I was when we did the programmes .
"I 'm almost sure the girls will want cards , and I know your mother would like some more tags , '' said Jill , briskly rattling the letters into the different compartments , while Jack inked the rollers and hunted up his big apron , whistling the while with recovered spirits ."
"A dozen neat cards were soon printed , and Jill insisted on paying six cents for them , as earning was not borrowing ."
"A few odd tags were found and done for Mamma , who immediately ordered four dozen at six cents a dozen , though she was not told why there was such a pressing call for money ."
"Jack 's monthly half-dollar had been spent the first week , -- twenty-five cents for a concert , ten paid a fine for keeping a book too long from the library , ten more to have his knife ground , and five in candy , for he dearly loved sweeties , and was under bonds to Mamma not to spend more than five cents a month on these unwholesome temptations ."
"She never asked the boys what they did with their money , but expected them to keep account in the little books she gave them ; and , now and then , they showed the neat pages with pardonable pride , though she often laughed at the queer items ."
"All that evening Jack & Co. worked busily , for when Frank came in he good-naturedly ordered some pale-pink cards for Annette , and ran to the store to choose the right shade , and buy some packages for the young printer also ."
`` What do you suppose he is in such a pucker for ? ''
"whispered Jill , as she set up the new name , to Frank , who sat close by , with one eye on his book and one on her ."
"`` Oh , some notion ."
"He 's a queer chap ; but I guess it is n't much of a scrape , or I should know it ."
"He 's so good-natured he 's always promising to do things for people , and has too much pluck to give up when he finds he ca n't ."
"`` A much larger share than mine , '' said Alan , smiling ."
"`` If Pat had not come for me , I would not have known of your danger ."
What a magnificent fellow he is ! ''
`` Is n't he ? ''
she agreed proudly .
"`` And so is Laddie , my other dog ."
He went with Father today .
I love my dogs more than people . ''
She looked at him with a little defiance in her eyes .
`` I suppose you think that terrible . ''
"`` I think many dogs are much more lovable -- and worthy of love -- than many people , '' said Alan , laughing ."
How childlike she was in some ways !
That trace of defiance -- it was so like a child who expected to be scolded for some wrong attitude of mind .
And yet there were moments when she looked the tall proud queen .
"Sometimes , when the path grew narrow , she walked before him , her hand on the dog 's head ."
"Alan liked this , since it left him free to watch admiringly the swinging grace of her step and the white curves of her neck beneath the thick braid of hair , which today was wound about her head ."
"When she dropped back beside him in the wider spaces , he could only have stolen glances at her profile , delicately , strongly cut , virginal in its soft curves , childlike in its purity ."
"Once she looked around and caught his glance ; again she flushed , and something strange and exultant stirred in Alan 's heart ."
"It was as if that maiden blush were the involuntary , unconscious admission of some power he had over her -- a power which her hitherto unfettered spirit had never before felt ."
"The cold indifference he had seen in her face at their first meeting was gone , and something told him it was gone forever ."
When they came in sight of Four Winds they saw two people walking up the road from the harbour and a few further steps brought them face to face with Captain Anthony Oliver and his old housekeeper .
The Captain 's appearance was a fresh surprise to Alan .
"He had expected to meet a rough , burly sailor , loud of voice and forbidding of manner ."
"Instead , Captain Anthony was a tall , well-built man of perhaps fifty ."
"His face , beneath its shock of iron-grey hair , was handsome but wore a somewhat forbidding expression , and there was something in it , apart from line or feature , which did not please Alan ."
"He had no time to analyze this impression , for Lynde said hurriedly , `` Father , this is Mr. Douglas ."
He has just done me a great service . ''
"She briefly explained her accident ; when she had finished , the Captain turned to Alan and held out his hand , a frank smile replacing the rather suspicious and contemptuous scowl which had previously overshadowed it ."
"`` I am much obliged to you , Mr. Douglas , '' he said cordially ."
`` You must come up to the house and let me thank you at leisure .
"As a rule I 'm not very partial to the cloth , as you may have heard ."
"In this case it is the man , not the minister , I invite . ''"
"I believe in Him now -- I have to -- there 's nothing else to fall back on but God -- humbly , starkly , unconditionally . '' ''"
"` Our help in ages past ' -- ` the same yesterday , to-day and for ever , ' '' said the minister gently ."
`` When we forget God -- He remembers us . ''
There was no crowd at the Glen Station the next morning to see Walter off .
It was becoming a commonplace for a khaki clad boy to board that early morning train after his last leave .
"Besides his own , only the Manse folk were there , and Mary Vance ."
"Mary had sent her Miller off the week before , with a determined grin , and now considered herself entitled to give expert opinion on how such partings should be conducted ."
"`` The main thing is to smile and act as if nothing was happening , '' she informed the Ingleside group ."
`` The boys all hate the sob act like poison .
Miller told me I was n't to come near the station if I could n't keep from bawling .
"So I got through with my crying beforehand , and at the last I said to him , ` Good luck , Miller , and if you come back you 'll find I have n't changed any , and if you do n't come back I 'll always be proud you went , and in any case do n't fall in love with a French girl . '"
"Miller swore he would n't , but you never can tell about those fascinating foreign hussies ."
"Anyhow , the last sight he had of me I was smiling to my limit ."
"Gee , all the rest of the day my face felt as if it had been starched and ironed into a smile . ''"
"In spite of Mary 's advice and example Mrs. Blythe , who had sent Jem off with a smile , could not quite manage one for Walter ."
But at least no one cried .
"Dog Monday came out of his lair in the shipping-shed and sat down close to Walter , thumping his tail vigorously on the boards of the platform whenever Walter spoke to him , and looking up with confident eyes , as if to say , `` I know you 'll find Jem and bring him back to me . ''"
"`` So long , old fellow , '' said Carl Meredith cheerfully , when the good-byes had to be said ."
`` Tell them over there to keep their spirits up -- I am coming along presently . ''
"`` Me too , '' said Shirley laconically , proffering a brown paw ."
Susan heard him and her face turned very grey .
"Una shook hands quietly , looking at him with wistful , sorrowful , dark-blue eyes ."
But then Una 's eyes had always been wistful .
"Walter bent his handsome black head in its khaki cap and kissed her with the warm , comradely kiss of a brother ."
"He had never kissed her before , and for a fleeting moment Una 's face betrayed her , if anyone had noticed ."
But nobody did ; the conductor was shouting `` all aboard '' ; everybody was trying to look very cheerful .
Walter turned to Rilla ; she held his hands and looked up at him .
She would not see him again until the day broke and the shadows vanished -- and she knew not if that daybreak would be on this side of the grave or beyond it .
"`` Good-bye , '' she said ."
On her lips it lost all the bitterness it had won through the ages of parting and bore instead all the sweetness of the old loves of all the women who had ever loved and prayed for the beloved .
"`` Write me often and bring Jims up faithfully , according to the gospel of Morgan , '' Walter said lightly , having said all his serious things the night before in Rainbow Valley ."
But at the last moment he took her face between his hands and looked deep into her gallant eyes .
"`` James must have tint his wits , '' said Alan ."
"`` If this was the soldiers instead of you and me , he would be in a bonny mess ."
"But I dare say he 'll have a sentry on the road , and he would ken well enough no soldiers would find the way that we came . ''"
"Hereupon he whistled three times , in a particular manner ."
"It was strange to see how , at the first sound of it , all the moving torches came to a stand , as if the bearers were affrighted ; and how , at the third , the bustle began again as before ."
"Having thus set folks ' minds at rest , we came down the brae , and were met at the yard gate -LRB- for this place was like a well-doing farm -RRB- by a tall , handsome man of more than fifty , who cried out to Alan in the Gaelic ."
"`` James Stewart , '' said Alan , `` I will ask ye to speak in Scotch , for here is a young gentleman with me that has nane of the other ."
"This is him , '' he added , putting his arm through mine , `` a young gentleman of the Lowlands , and a laird in his country too , but I am thinking it will be the better for his health if we give his name the go-by . ''"
"James of the Glens turned to me for a moment , and greeted me courteously enough ; the next he had turned to Alan ."
"`` This has been a dreadful accident , '' he cried ."
`` It will bring trouble on the country . ''
And he wrung his hands .
`` Hoots ! ''
"said Alan , `` ye must take the sour with the sweet , man ."
"Colin Roy is dead , and be thankful for that ! ''"
"`` Ay '' said James , `` and by my troth , I wish he was alive again !"
"It 's all very fine to blow and boast beforehand ; but now it 's done , Alan ; and who 's to bear the wyte * of it ?"
"The accident fell out in Appin -- mind ye that , Alan ; it 's Appin that must pay ; and I am a man that has a family . ''"
* Blame .
While this was going on I looked about me at the servants .
"Some were on ladders , digging in the thatch of the house or the farm buildings , from which they brought out guns , swords , and different weapons of war ; others carried them away ; and by the sound of mattock blows from somewhere farther down the brae , I suppose they buried them ."
"Though they were all so busy , there prevailed no kind of order in their efforts ; men struggled together for the same gun and ran into each other with their burning torches ; and James was continually turning about from his talk with Alan , to cry out orders which were apparently never understood ."
"The faces in the torchlight were like those of people overborne with hurry and panic ; and though none spoke above his breath , their speech sounded both anxious and angry ."
It was about this time that a lassie came out of the house carrying a pack or bundle ; and it has often made me smile to think how Alan 's instinct awoke at the mere sight of it .
`` What 's that the lassie has ? ''
he asked .
"`` We 're just setting the house in order , Alan , '' said James , in his frightened and somewhat fawning way ."
"`` They 'll search Appin with candles , and we must have all things straight ."
"We 're digging the bit guns and swords into the moss , ye see ; and these , I am thinking , will be your ain French clothes ."
"We 'll be to bury them , I believe . ''"
`` Bury my French clothes ! ''
cried Alan .
"The sheriff 's officer had run back at the first sound of the shot , to hasten the coming of the soldiers ."
"At last the lawyer laid down the dead man in his blood upon the road , and got to his own feet with a kind of stagger ."
"I believe it was his movement that brought me to my senses ; for he had no sooner done so than I began to scramble up the hill , crying out , `` The murderer !"
the murderer ! ''
"So little a time had elapsed , that when I got to the top of the first steepness , and could see some part of the open mountain , the murderer was still moving away at no great distance ."
"He was a big man , in a black coat , with metal buttons , and carried a long fowling-piece ."
`` Here ! ''
I cried .
`` I see him ! ''
"At that the murderer gave a little , quick look over his shoulder , and began to run ."
"The next moment he was lost in a fringe of birches ; then he came out again on the upper side , where I could see him climbing like a jackanapes , for that part was again very steep ; and then he dipped behind a shoulder , and I saw him no more ."
"All this time I had been running on my side , and had got a good way up , when a voice cried upon me to stand ."
"I was at the edge of the upper wood , and so now , when I halted and looked back , I saw all the open part of the hill below me ."
"The lawyer and the sheriff 's officer were standing just above the road , crying and waving on me to come back ; and on their left , the red-coats , musket in hand , were beginning to struggle singly out of the lower wood ."
`` Why should I come back ? ''
I cried .
`` Come you on ! ''
`` Ten pounds if ye take that lad ! ''
cried the lawyer .
`` He 's an accomplice .
He was posted here to hold us in talk . ''
"At that word -LRB- which I could hear quite plainly , though it was to the soldiers and not to me that he was crying it -RRB- my heart came in my mouth with quite a new kind of terror ."
"Indeed , it is one thing to stand the danger of your life , and quite another to run the peril of both life and character ."
"The thing , besides , had come so suddenly , like thunder out of a clear sky , that I was all amazed and helpless ."
"The soldiers began to spread , some of them to run , and others to put up their pieces and cover me ; and still I stood ."
"`` Jock * in here among the trees , '' said a voice close by ."
* Duck .
"Indeed , I scarce knew what I was doing , but I obeyed ; and as I did so , I heard the firelocks bang and the balls whistle in the birches ."
"Just inside the shelter of the trees I found Alan Breck standing , with a fishing-rod ."
He gave me no salutation ; indeed it was no time for civilities ; only `` Come ! ''
"says he , and set off running along the side of the mountain towards Balachulish ; and I , like a sheep , to follow him ."
Now we ran among the birches ; now stooping behind low humps upon the mountain-side ; now crawling on all fours among the heather .
"`` Why , I am not running Rilla down , '' said Irene , opening her eyes widely ."
`` It was only her lack of feeling I was criticizing .
I suppose she ca n't help it .
"Of course , she 's a born manager -- everyone knows that ."
"She 's very fond of managing , too -- and people like that are very necessary I admit ."
"So do n't look at me as if I 'd said something perfectly dreadful , Betty , please ."
"I 'm quite willing to agree that Rilla Blythe is the embodiment of all the virtues , if that will please you ."
And no doubt it is a virtue to be quite unmoved by things that would crush most people . ''
Some of Irene 's remarks were reported to Rilla ; but they did not hurt her as they would once have done .
"They did n't matter , that was all ."
Life was too big to leave room for pettiness .
She had a pact to keep and a work to do ; and through the long hard days and weeks of that disastrous autumn she was faithful to her task .
"The war news was consistently bad , for Germany marched from victory to victory over poor Rumania ."
"`` Foreigners -- foreigners , '' Susan muttered dubiously ."
"`` Russians or Rumanians or whatever they may be , they are foreigners and you can not tie to them ."
But after Verdun I shall not give up hope .
"And can you tell me , Mrs. Dr. dear , if the Dobruja is a river or a mountain range , or a condition of the atmosphere ? ''"
"The Presidential election in the United States came off in November , and Susan was red-hot over that -- and quite apologetic for her excitement ."
"`` I never thought I would live to see the day when I would be interested in a Yankee election , Mrs. Dr. dear ."
"It only goes to show we can never know what we will come to in this world , and therefore we should not be proud . ''"
"Susan stayed up late on the evening of the eleventh , ostensibly to finish a pair of socks ."
"But she ` phoned down to Carter Flagg 's store at intervals , and when the first report came through that Hughes had been elected she stalked solemnly upstairs to Mrs. Blythe 's room and announced it in a thrilling whisper from the foot of the bed ."
`` I thought if you were not asleep you would be interested in knowing it .
I believe it is for the best .
"Perhaps he will just fall to writing notes , too , Mrs. Dr. dear , but I hope for better things ."
"I never was very partial to whiskers , but one can not have everything . ''"
"When news came in the morning that after all Wilson was re-elected , Susan tacked to catch another breeze of optimism ."
"`` Well , better a fool you know than a fool you do not know , as the old proverb has it , '' she remarked cheerfully ."
"`` Not that I hold Woodrow to be a fool by any means , though by times you would not think he has the sense he was born with ."
"But he is a good letter writer at least , and we do not know if the Hughes man is even that ."
All things being considered I commend the Yankees .
They have shown good sense and I do not mind admitting it .
"Maimie cried , falling on her knees , for the little house was now the size of a reel of thread , but still quite complete ."
"But as she stretched out her arms imploringly the snow crept up on all sides until it met itself , and where the little house had been was now one unbroken expanse of snow ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Fairies never say , ` We feel happy ' : what they say is , ` We feel dancey ' -RSB- Maimie stamped her foot naughtily , and was putting her fingers to her eyes , when she heard a kind voice say , ` Do n't cry , pretty human , do n't cry , ' and then she turned round and saw a beautiful little naked boy regarding her wistfully ."
She knew at once that he must be Peter Pan .
"-LSB- Illustration : Tailpiece to ` The Little House ' -RSB- -LSB- Illustration : Headpiece to ` Peter 's Goat ' -RSB- VI PETER 'S GOAT Maimie felt quite shy , but Peter knew not what shy was . '"
"I hope you have had a good night , ' he said earnestly ."
"` Thank you , ' she replied , ' I was so cosy and warm ."
But you ' -- and she looked at his nakedness awkwardly -- ` do n't you feel the least bit cold ? '
"Now cold was another word Peter had forgotten , so he answered , ' I think not , but I may be wrong : you see I am rather ignorant ."
I am not exactly a boy ; Solomon says I am a Betwixt-and-Between . '
"` So that is what it is called , ' said Maimie thoughtfully ."
"` That 's not my name , ' he explained , ` my name is Peter Pan . '"
"` Yes , of course , ' she said , ' I know , everybody knows . '"
You ca n't think how pleased Peter was to learn that all the people outside the gates knew about him .
"He begged Maimie to tell him what they knew and what they said , and she did so ."
"They were sitting by this time on a fallen tree ; Peter had cleared off the snow for Maimie , but he sat on a snowy bit himself ."
"` Squeeze closer , ' Maimie said ."
` What is that ? '
"he asked , and she showed him , and then he did it ."
"They talked together and he found that people knew a great deal about him , but not everything , not that he had gone back to his mother and been barred out , for instance , and he said nothing of this to Maimie , for it still humiliated him ."
` Do they know that I play games exactly like real boys ? '
he asked very proudly . '
"O Maimie , please tell them ! '"
"But when he revealed how he played , by sailing his hoop on the Round Pond , and so on , she was simply horrified ."
"` All your ways of playing , ' she said with her big eyes on him , ` are quite , quite wrong , and not in the least like how boys play . '"
"Poor Peter uttered a little moan at this , and he cried for the first time for I know not how long ."
"Maimie was extremely sorry for him , and lent him her handkerchief , but he did n't know in the least what to do with it , so she showed him , that is to say , she wiped her eyes , and then gave it back to him , saying , ` Now you do it , ' but instead of wiping his own eyes he wiped hers , and she thought it best to pretend that this was what she had meant ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Looking very undancey indeed -RSB- She said out of pity for him , ' I shall give you a kiss if you like , ' but though he once knew , he had long forgotten what kisses are , and he replied , ` Thank you , ' and held out his hand , thinking she had offered to put something into it ."
"This was a great shock to her , but she felt she could not explain without shaming him , so with charming delicacy she gave Peter a thimble which happened to be in her pocket , and pretended that it was a kiss ."
Poor little boy !
"he quite believed her , and to this day he wears it on his finger , though there can be scarcely any one who needs a thimble so little ."
"You see , though still a tiny child , it was really years and years since he had seen his mother , and I dare say the baby who had supplanted him was now a man with whiskers ."
"`` Fool , he had more in his sandal , or stitched into his tippet ."
"Y ' are but a child , Tom Cuckow ; ye have lost the fish . ''"
"But , for all that , Ellis pocketed the purse with nonchalance ."
"He stood leaning on his boar-spear , and looked round upon the rest ."
"They , in various attitudes , took greedily of the venison pottage , and liberally washed it down with ale ."
"This was a good day ; they were in luck ; but business pressed , and they were speedy in their eating ."
The first-comers had by this time even despatched their dinner .
"Some lay down upon the grass and fell instantly asleep , like boa-constrictors ; others talked together , or overhauled their weapons : and one , whose humour was particularly gay , holding forth an ale-horn , began to sing : `` Here is no law in good green shaw , Here is no lack of meat ; 'T is merry and quiet , with deer for our diet , In summer , when all is sweet ."
"Come winter again , with wind and rain -- Come winter , with snow and sleet , Get home to your places , with hoods on your faces , And sit by the fire and eat . ''"
"All this while the two lads had listened and lain close ; only Richard had unslung his cross-bow , and held ready in one hand the windac , or grappling-iron that he used to bend it ."
Otherwise they had not dared to stir ; and this scene of forest life had gone on before their eyes like a scene upon a theatre .
But now there came a strange interruption .
The tall chimney which over-topped the remainder of the ruins rose right above their hiding-place .
"There came a whistle in the air , and then a sounding smack , and the fragments of a broken arrow fell about their ears ."
"Some one from the upper quarters of the wood , perhaps the very sentinel they saw posted in the fir , had shot an arrow at the chimney-top ."
"Matcham could not restrain a little cry , which he instantly stifled , and even Dick started with surprise , and dropped the windac from his fingers ."
"But to the fellows on the lawn , this shaft was an expected signal ."
"They were all afoot together , tightening their belts , testing their bow-strings , loosening sword and dagger in the sheath ."
Ellis held up his hand ; his face had suddenly assumed a look of savage energy ; the white of his eyes shone in his sun-brown face .
"`` Lads , '' he said , `` ye know your places ."
Let not one man 's soul escape you .
Appleyard was a whet before a meal ; but now we go to table .
"I have three men whom I will bitterly avenge -- Harry Shelton , Simon Malmesbury , and '' -- striking his broad bosom -- `` and Ellis Duckworth , by the mass ! ''"
"Another man came , red with hurry , through the thorns . ''"
'T is not Sir Daniel ! ''
he panted .
`` They are but seven .
Is the arrow gone ? ''
"`` It struck but now , '' replied Ellis ."
`` A murrain ! ''
cried the messenger .
`` Methought I heard it whistle .
"But no one has really seen it , except just three or four , and they have not only seen it but slept in it , and unless you sleep in it you never see it ."
"This is because it is not there when you lie down , but it is there when you wake up and step outside ."
"In a kind of way everyone may see it , but what you see is not really it , but only the light in the windows ."
You see the light after Lock-out Time .
"David , for instance , saw it quite distinctly far away among the trees as we were going home from the pantomime , and Oliver Bailey saw it the night he stayed so late at the Temple , which is the name of his father 's office ."
"Angela Clare , who loves to have a tooth extracted because then she is treated to tea in a shop , saw more than one light , she saw hundreds of them all together , and this must have been the fairies building the house , for they build it every night and always in a different part of the Gardens ."
"She thought one of the lights was bigger than the others , though she was not quite sure , for they jumped about so , and it might have been another one that was bigger ."
"But if it was the same one , it was Peter Pan 's light ."
"Heaps of children have seen the fight , so that is nothing ."
But Maimie Mannering was the famous one for whom the house was first built .
"Maimie was always rather a strange girl , and it was at night that she was strange ."
"She was four years of age , and in the daytime she was the ordinary kind ."
"She was pleased when her brother Tony , who was a magnificent fellow of six , took notice of her , and she looked up to him in the right way , and tried in vain to imitate him and was flattered rather than annoyed when he shoved her about ."
"Also , when she was batting she would pause though the ball was in the air to point out to you that she was wearing new shoes ."
She was quite the ordinary kind in the daytime .
"But as the shades of night fell , Tony , the swaggerer , lost his contempt for Maimie and eyed her fearfully , and no wonder , for with dark there came into her face a look that I can describe only as a leary look ."
It was also a serene look that contrasted grandly with Tony 's uneasy glances .
Then he would make her presents of his favourite toys -LRB- which he always took away from her next morning -RRB- and she accepted them with a disturbing smile .
The reason he was now become so wheedling and she so mysterious was -LRB- in brief -RRB- that they knew they were about to be sent to bed .
It was then that Maimie was terrible .
"Tony entreated her not to do it to-night , and the mother and their coloured nurse threatened her , but Maimie merely smiled her agitating smile ."
And by-and-by when they were alone with their night-light she would start up in bed crying `` Hsh !
what was that ? ''
Tony beseeches her !
"`` It was nothing -- do n't , Maimie , do n't ! ''"
and pulls the sheet over his head .
`` It is coming nearer ! ''
"she cries ; `` Oh , look at it , Tony !"
"It is feeling your bed with its horns -- it is boring for you , oh , Tony , oh ! ''"
"and she desists not until he rushes downstairs in his combinations , screeching ."
"When they came up to whip Maimie they usually found her sleeping tranquilly , not shamming , you know , but really sleeping , and looking like the sweetest little angel , which seems to me to make it almost worse ."
"But of course it was daytime when they were in the Gardens , and then Tony did most of the talking ."
`` What 's this ? ''
"`` We 're a-changing of the powder , Jack , '' answers one ."
"`` Why , by the powers , '' cried Long John , `` if we do , we 'll miss the morning tide ! ''"
`` My orders ! ''
said the captain shortly .
"`` You may go below , my man ."
Hands will want supper . ''
"`` Aye , aye , sir , '' answered the cook , and touching his forelock , he disappeared at once in the direction of his galley ."
"`` That 's a good man , captain , '' said the doctor ."
"`` Very likely , sir , '' replied Captain Smollett ."
"`` Easy with that , men -- easy , '' he ran on , to the fellows who were shifting the powder ; and then suddenly observing me examining the swivel we carried amidships , a long brass nine , `` Here you , ship 's boy , '' he cried , `` out o ' that !"
Off with you to the cook and get some work . ''
"And then as I was hurrying off I heard him say , quite loudly , to the doctor , `` I 'll have no favourites on my ship . ''"
"I assure you I was quite of the squire 's way of thinking , and hated the captain deeply ."
"10 The Voyage ALL that night we were in a great bustle getting things stowed in their place , and boatfuls of the squire 's friends , Mr. Blandly and the like , coming off to wish him a good voyage and a safe return ."
"We never had a night at the Admiral Benbow when I had half the work ; and I was dog-tired when , a little before dawn , the boatswain sounded his pipe and the crew began to man the capstan-bars ."
"I might have been twice as weary , yet I would not have left the deck , all was so new and interesting to me -- the brief commands , the shrill note of the whistle , the men bustling to their places in the glimmer of the ship 's lanterns ."
"`` Now , Barbecue , tip us a stave , '' cried one voice ."
"`` The old one , '' cried another ."
"`` Aye , aye , mates , '' said Long John , who was standing by , with his crutch under his arm , and at once broke out in the air and words I knew so well : `` Fifteen men on the dead man 's chest -- '' And then the whole crew bore chorus : -- `` Yo-ho-ho , and a bottle of rum ! ''"
And at the third `` Ho ! ''
drove the bars before them with a will .
"Even at that exciting moment it carried me back to the old Admiral Benbow in a second , and I seemed to hear the voice of the captain piping in the chorus ."
"But soon the anchor was short up ; soon it was hanging dripping at the bows ; soon the sails began to draw , and the land and shipping to flit by on either side ; and before I could lie down to snatch an hour of slumber the HISPANIOLA had begun her voyage to the Isle of Treasure ."
I am not going to relate that voyage in detail .
It was fairly prosperous .
"The ship proved to be a good ship , the crew were capable seamen , and the captain thoroughly understood his business ."
"But before we came the length of Treasure Island , two or three things had happened which require to be known ."
"Mr. Arrow , first of all , turned out even worse than the captain had feared ."
"He had no command among the men , and people did what they pleased with him ."
"But that was by no means the worst of it , for after a day or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazy eye , red cheeks , stuttering tongue , and other marks of drunkenness ."
Time after time he was ordered below in disgrace .
"Y ' are called to count for this ; in the end , I wot not how , ye have ever the uppermost at law , and ye think all patched ."
"But give me leave , Sir Oliver : the man that ye have dispossessed and beaten is but the angrier , and some day , when the black devil is by , he will up with his bow and clout me a yard of arrow through your inwards . ''"
"`` Nay , Bennet , y ' are in the wrong ."
"Bennet , ye should be glad to be corrected , '' said Sir Oliver ."
"`` Y ' are a prater , Bennet , a talker , a babbler ; your mouth is wider than your two ears ."
"Mend it , Bennet , mend it . ''"
"`` Nay , I say no more ."
"Have it as ye list , '' said the retainer ."
"The priest now rose from the stool , and from the writing-case that hung about his neck took forth wax and a taper , and a flint and steel ."
"With these he sealed up the chest and the cupboard with Sir Daniel 's arms , Hatch looking on disconsolate ; and then the whole party proceeded , somewhat timorously , to sally from the house and get to horse . ''"
"'T is time we were on the road , Sir Oliver , '' said Hatch , as he held the priest 's stirrup while he mounted ."
"`` Ay ; but , Bennet , things are changed , '' returned the parson ."
`` There is now no Appleyard -- rest his soul !
-- to keep the garrison .
"I shall keep you , Bennet ."
I must have a good man to rest me on in this day of black arrows .
"` The arrow that flieth by day , ' saith the evangel ; I have no mind of the context ; nay , I am a sluggard priest , I am too deep in men 's affairs ."
"Well , let us ride forth , Master Hatch ."
The jackmen should be at the church by now . ''
"So they rode forward down the road , with the wind after them , blowing the tails of the parson 's cloak ; and behind them , as they went , clouds began to arise and blot out the sinking sun ."
"They had passed three of the scattered houses that make up Tunstall hamlet , when , coming to a turn , they saw the church before them ."
Ten or a dozen houses clustered immediately round it ; but to the back the churchyard was next the meadows .
"At the lych-gate , near a score of men were gathered , some in the saddle , some standing by their horses ' heads ."
"They were variously armed and mounted ; some with spears , some with bills , some with bows , and some bestriding plough-horses , still splashed with the mire of the furrow ; for these were the very dregs of the country , and all the better men and the fair equipments were already with Sir Daniel in the field ."
"`` We have not done amiss , praised be the cross of Holywood !"
"Sir Daniel will be right well content , '' observed the priest , inwardly numbering the troop ."
`` Who goes ?
Stand !
if ye be true ! ''
shouted Bennet .
"A man was seen slipping through the churchyard among the yews ; and at the sound of this summons he discarded all concealment , and fairly took to his heels for the forest ."
"The men at the gate , who had been hitherto unaware of the stranger 's presence , woke and scattered ."
I never expected this !
I must stay with the student . '
"The little fellow thought it over , for he was a sensible Goblin ."
"Then he sighed , ` The student has no jam ! '"
And on that he went down to the grocer again .
"And it was a good thing that he did go back , for the tub had nearly worn out the tongue ."
"It had read everything that was inside it , on the one side , and was just going to turn itself round and read from the other side when the Goblin came in and returned the tongue to its owner ."
"But the whole shop , from the till down to the shavings , from that night changed their opinion of the tub , and they looked up to it , and had such faith in it that they were under the impression that when the grocer read the art and drama critiques out of the paper in the evenings , it all came from the tub ."
But the Goblin could no longer sit quietly listening to the wisdom and intellect downstairs .
"No , as soon as the light shone in the evening from the attic it seemed to him as though its beams were strong ropes dragging him up , and he had to go and peep through the key-hole ."
"There he felt the sort of feeling we have looking at the great rolling sea in a storm , and he burst into tears ."
"He could not himself say why he wept , but in spite of his tears he felt quite happy ."
"How beautiful it must be to sit under that tree with the student , but that he could not do ; he had to content himself with the key-hole and be happy there !"
"There he stood out on the cold landing , the autumn wind blowing through the cracks of the floor ."
"It was cold -- very cold , but he first found it out when the light in the attic was put out and the music in the wood died away ."
Ah !
"then it froze him , and he crept down again into his warm corner ; there it was comfortable and cosy ."
"When Christmas came , and with it the jam with the large lump of butter , ah !"
then the grocer was first with him .
"But in the middle of the night the Goblin awoke , hearing a great noise and knocking against the shutters -- people hammering from outside ."
The watchman was blowing his horn : a great fire had broken out ; the whole town was in flames .
Was it in the house ?
or was it at a neighbour 's ?
Where was it ?
The alarm increased .
The grocer 's wife was so terrified that she took her gold earrings out of her ears and put them in her pocket in order to save something .
The grocer seized his account books .
and the maid her black silk dress .
"Everyone wanted to save his most valuable possession ; so did the Goblin , and in a few leaps he was up the stairs and in the student 's room ."
He was standing quietly by the open window looking at the fire that was burning in the neighbour 's house just opposite .
"The Goblin seized the book lying on the table , put it in his red cap , and clasped it with both hands ."
"The best treasure in the house was saved , and he climbed out on to the roof with it -- on to the chimney ."
`` What can he do ?
He hath but a handful .
"Alack , if it were but to-morrow -- could I but keep a certain tryst an hour before noon to-morrow -- all were , I think , otherwise ."
But now there is no help . ''
"`` Well , '' concluded Lawless , `` an ye will stand to it for my innocence , I will stand to it for yours , and that stoutly ."
"It shall naught avail us ; but an I be to hang , it shall not be for lack of swearing . ''"
"And then , while Dick gave himself over to his reflections , the old rogue curled himself down into a corner , pulled his monkish hood about his face , and composed himself to sleep ."
"Soon he was loudly snoring , so utterly had his long life of hardship and adventure blunted the sense of apprehension ."
"It was long after noon , and the day was already failing , before the door was opened and Dick taken forth and led up-stairs to where , in a warm cabinet , Earl Risingham sat musing over the fire ."
On his captive 's entrance he looked up .
"`` Sir , '' he said , `` I knew your father , who was a man of honour , and this inclineth me to be the more lenient ; but I may not hide from you that heavy charges lie against your character ."
"Ye do consort with murderers and robbers ; upon a clear probation ye have carried war against the king 's peace ; ye are suspected to have piratically seized upon a ship ; ye are found skulking with a counterfeit presentment in your enemy 's house ; a man is slain that very evening -- '' `` An it like you , my lord , '' Dick interposed , `` I will at once avow my guilt , such as it is ."
I slew this fellow Rutter ; and to the proof '' -- searching in his bosom -- `` here is a letter from his wallet . ''
"Lord Risingham took the letter , and opened and read it twice ."
`` Ye have read this ? ''
he inquired .
"`` I have read it , '' answered Dick ."
`` Are ye for York or Lancaster ? ''
the earl demanded .
"`` My lord , it was but a little while back that I was asked that question , and knew not how to answer it , '' said Dick ; `` but having answered once , I will not vary ."
"My lord , I am for York . ''"
The earl nodded approvingly .
"`` Honestly replied , '' he said ."
"`` But wherefore , then , deliver me this letter ? ''"
"`` Nay , but against traitors , my lord , are not all sides arrayed ? ''"
cried Dick .
"`` I would they were , young gentleman , '' returned the earl ; `` and I do at least approve your saying ."
"There is more youth than guile in you , I do perceive ; and were not Sir Daniel a mighty man upon our side , I were half-tempted to espouse your quarrel ."
"For I have inquired , and it appears ye have been hardly dealt with , and have much excuse ."
"But look ye , sir , I am , before all else , a leader in the queen 's interest ; and though by nature a just man , as I believe , and leaning even to the excess of mercy , yet must I order my goings for my party 's interest , and , to keep Sir Daniel , I would go far about . ''"
"`` My lord , '' returned Dick , `` ye will think me very bold to counsel you ; but do ye count upon Sir Daniel 's faith ?"
Methought he had changed sides intolerably often . ''
"We promised Ed to stand by Bob , so I did as well as I knew how ; '' and Jack seemed to think that was about all there was to say ."
`` I never saw such a fellow for keeping a promise !
"You stick to it through thick and thin , no matter how silly or hard it is ."
"You remember , mother , last summer , how you told him not to go in a boat and he promised , the day we went on the picnic ."
"We rode up , but the horse ran off home , so we had to come back by way of the river , all but Jack , and he walked every step of five miles because he would n't go near a boat , though Mr. Burton was there to take care of him ."
I call that rather overdoing the matter ; '' and Frank looked as if he thought moderation even in virtue a good thing .
`` And I call it a fine sample of entire obedience .
"He obeyed orders , and that is what we all must do , without always seeing why , or daring to use our own judgment ."
"It is a great safeguard to Jack , and a very great comfort to me ; for I know that if he promises he will keep his word , no matter what it costs him , '' said Mamma warmly , as she tumbled up the quirls with an irrepressible caress , remembering how the boy came wearily in after all the others , without seeming for a moment to think that he could have done anything else ."
`` Like Casabianca ! ''
"cried Jill , much impressed , for obedience was her hardest trial ."
"`` I think he was a fool to burn up , '' said Frank , bound not to give in ."
`` I do n't .
"It 's a splendid piece , and every one likes to speak it , and it was true , and it would n't be in all the books if he was a fool ."
"Grown people know what is good , '' declared Jill , who liked heroic actions , and was always hoping for a chance to distinguish herself in that way ."
"`` You admire ` The Charge of the Light Brigade , ' and glow all over as you thunder it out ."
Yet they went gallantly to their death rather than disobey orders .
"A mistake , perhaps , but it makes us thrill to hear of it ; and the same spirit keeps my Jack true as steel when once his word is passed , or he thinks it is his duty ."
"Do n't be laughed out of it , my son , for faithfulness in little things fits one for heroism when the great trials come ."
One 's conscience can hardly be too tender when honor and honesty are concerned . ''
"`` You are right , mother , and I am wrong ."
"I beg your pardon , Jack , and you sha 'n' t get ahead of me next time . ''"
"Frank made his mother a little bow , gave his brother a shake of the hand , and nodded to Jill , as if anxious to show that he was not too proud to own up when he made a mistake ."
"`` Please tell on , Jack ."
"This is very nice , but I do want to know all about the other , '' said Jill , after a short pause ."
`` Let me see .
"Oh , I saw Bob at church , and he looked rather blue ; so , after Sunday School , I asked what the matter was ."
"He said Jerry bothered him for some money he lent him at different times when they were loafing round together , before we took him up ."
He would n't get any wages for some time .
"The Captain keeps him short on purpose , I guess , and wo n't let him come down town except on Sundays ."
"He did n't want any one to know about it , for fear he 'd lose his place ."
So I promised I would n't tell .
Let 's have a go of the rum . ''
"`` Dick , '' said Silver , `` I trust you ."
"I 've a gauge on the keg , mind ."
There 's the key ; you fill a pannikin and bring it up . ''
"Terrified as I was , I could not help thinking to myself that this must have been how Mr. Arrow got the strong waters that destroyed him ."
"Dick was gone but a little while , and during his absence Israel spoke straight on in the cook 's ear ."
"It was but a word or two that I could catch , and yet I gathered some important news , for besides other scraps that tended to the same purpose , this whole clause was audible : `` Not another man of them 'll jine . ''"
Hence there were still faithful men on board .
"When Dick returned , one after another of the trio took the pannikin and drank -- one `` To luck , '' another with a `` Here 's to old Flint , '' and Silver himself saying , in a kind of song , `` Here 's to ourselves , and hold your luff , plenty of prizes and plenty of duff . ''"
"Just then a sort of brightness fell upon me in the barrel , and looking up , I found the moon had risen and was silvering the mizzen-top and shining white on the luff of the fore-sail ; and almost at the same time the voice of the lookout shouted , `` Land ho ! ''"
12 Council of War THERE was a great rush of feet across the deck .
"I could hear people tumbling up from the cabin and the forecastle , and slipping in an instant outside my barrel , I dived behind the fore-sail , made a double towards the stern , and came out upon the open deck in time to join Hunter and Dr. Livesey in the rush for the weather bow ."
There all hands were already congregated .
A belt of fog had lifted almost simultaneously with the appearance of the moon .
"Away to the south-west of us we saw two low hills , about a couple of miles apart , and rising behind one of them a third and higher hill , whose peak was still buried in the fog ."
All three seemed sharp and conical in figure .
"So much I saw , almost in a dream , for I had not yet recovered from my horrid fear of a minute or two before ."
And then I heard the voice of Captain Smollett issuing orders .
The HISPANIOLA was laid a couple of points nearer the wind and now sailed a course that would just clear the island on the east .
"`` And now , men , '' said the captain , when all was sheeted home , `` has any one of you ever seen that land ahead ? ''"
"`` I have , sir , '' said Silver ."
`` I 've watered there with a trader I was cook in . ''
"`` The anchorage is on the south , behind an islet , I fancy ? ''"
asked the captain .
"`` Yes , sir ; Skeleton Island they calls it ."
"It were a main place for pirates once , and a hand we had on board knowed all their names for it ."
"That hill to the nor ` ard they calls the Fore-mast Hill ; there are three hills in a row running south ` ard -- fore , main , and mizzen , sir ."
"But the main -- that 's the big un , with the cloud on it -- they usually calls the Spy-glass , by reason of a lookout they kept when they was in the anchorage cleaning , for it 's there they cleaned their ships , sir , asking your pardon . ''"
"`` I have a chart here , '' says Captain Smollett ."
`` See if that 's the place . ''
"Long John 's eyes burned in his head as he took the chart , but by the fresh look of the paper I knew he was doomed to disappointment ."
"This was not the map we found in Billy Bones 's chest , but an accurate copy , complete in all things -- names and heights and soundings -- with the single exception of the red crosses and the written notes ."
"she is the one who laughs continuously because there are so many white children in the world , but she was not to laugh much more that day ."
"Well , they went up the Baby Walk and back , and when they returned to the time-board she was surprised to see that it now read five o'clock for closing-time ."
"But she was unacquainted with the tricky ways of the fairies , and so did not see -LRB- as Maimie and Tony saw at once -RRB- that they had changed the hour because there was to be a ball to-night ."
"She said there was only time now to walk to the top of the Hump and back , and as they trotted along with her she little guessed what was thrilling their little breasts ."
You see the chance had come of seeing a fairy ball .
"Never , Tony felt , could he hope for a better chance ."
"-LSB- Illustration : One day they were overheard by a fairy -RSB- He had to feel this , for Maimie so plainly felt it for him ."
"Her eager eyes asked the question , ` Is it to-day ? '"
and he gasped and then nodded .
"Maimie slipped her hand into Tony 's , and hers was hot , but his was cold ."
She did a very kind thing ; she took off her scarf and gave it to him .
"` In case you should feel cold , ' she whispered ."
"Her face was aglow , but Tony 's was very gloomy ."
"As they turned on the top of the Hump he whispered to her , ` I 'm afraid nurse would see me , so I sha n't be able to do it . '"
"Maimie admired him more than ever for being afraid of nothing but their ayah , when there were so many unknown terrors to fear , and she said aloud , ` Tony , I shall race you to the gate , ' and in a whisper , ` Then you can hide , ' and off they ran ."
"Tony could always outdistance her easily , but never had she known him speed away so quickly as now , and she was sure he hurried that he might have more time to hide ."
"` Brave , brave ! '"
"her doting eyes were crying when she got a dreadful shock ; instead of hiding , her hero had run out at the gate !"
"At this bitter sight Maimie stopped blankly , as if all her lapful of darling treasures were suddenly spilled , and then for very disdain she could not sob ; in a swell of protest against all puling cowards she ran to St. Govor 's Well and hid in Tony 's stead ."
When the ayah reached the gate and saw Tony far in front she thought her other charge was with him and passed out .
"Twilight crept over the Gardens , and hundreds of people passed out , including the last one , who always has to run for it , but Maimie saw them not ."
She had shut her eyes tight and glued them with passionate tears .
When she opened them something very cold ran up her legs and up her arms and dropped into her heart .
It was the stillness of the Gardens .
"Then she heard clang , then from another part clang , then clang , clang far away ."
It was the Closing of the Gates .
"Immediately the last clang had died away Maimie distinctly heard a voice say , ` So that 's all right . '"
"It had a wooden sound and seemed to come from above , and she looked up in time to see an elm-tree stretching out its arms and yawning ."
"-LSB- Illustration : The little people weave their summer curtains from skeleton leaves -RSB- She was about to say , ' I never knew you could speak ! '"
"when a metallic voice that seemed to come from the ladle at the well remarked to the elm , ' I suppose it is a bit coldish up there ? '"
"and the elm replied , ` Not particularly , but you do get numb standing so long on one leg , ' and he flapped his arms vigorously just as the cabmen do before they drive off ."
"Maimie was quite surprised to see that a number of other tall trees were doing the same sort of thing , and she stole away to the Baby Walk and crouched observantly under a Minorca holly which shrugged its shoulders but did not seem to mind her ."
"So when he had freed Wendy , he whispered for her to conceal herself with the others , and himself took her place by the mast , her cloak around him so that he should pass for her ."
Then he took a great breath and crowed .
To the pirates it was a voice crying that all the boys lay slain in the cabin ; and they were panic-stricken .
"Hook tried to hearten them ; but like the dogs he had made them they showed him their fangs , and he knew that if he took his eyes off them now they would leap at him ."
"`` Lads , '' he said , ready to cajole or strike as need be , but never quailing for an instant , `` I 've thought it out ."
There 's a Jonah aboard . ''
"`` Ay , '' they snarled , `` a man wi ' a hook . ''"
"`` No , lads , no , it 's the girl ."
Never was luck on a pirate ship wi ' a woman on board .
We 'll right the ship when she 's gone . ''
Some of them remembered that this had been a saying of Flint 's .
"`` It 's worth trying , '' they said doubtfully ."
"`` Fling the girl overboard , '' cried Hook ; and they made a rush at the figure in the cloak ."
"`` There 's none can save you now , missy , '' Mullins hissed jeeringly ."
"`` There 's one , '' replied the figure ."
`` Who 's that ? ''
`` Peter Pan the avenger ! ''
came the terrible answer ; and as he spoke Peter flung off his cloak .
"Then they all knew who 't was that had been undoing them in the cabin , and twice Hook essayed to speak and twice he failed ."
In that frightful moment I think his fierce heart broke .
"At last he cried , `` Cleave him to the brisket ! ''"
but without conviction .
"`` Down , boys , and at them ! ''"
Peter 's voice rang out ; and in another moment the clash of arms was resounding through the ship .
"Had the pirates kept together it is certain that they would have won ; but the onset came when they were still unstrung , and they ran hither and thither , striking wildly , each thinking himself the last survivor of the crew ."
"Man to man they were the stronger ; but they fought on the defensive only , which enabled the boys to hunt in pairs and choose their quarry ."
"Some of the miscreants leapt into the sea ; others hid in dark recesses , where they were found by Slightly , who did not fight , but ran about with a lantern which he flashed in their faces , so that they were half blinded and fell as an easy prey to the reeking swords of the other boys ."
"There was little sound to be heard but the clang of weapons , an occasional screech or splash , and Slightly monotonously counting -- five -- six -- seven eight -- nine -- ten -- eleven ."
"I think all were gone when a group of savage boys surrounded Hook , who seemed to have a charmed life , as he kept them at bay in that circle of fire ."
"They had done for his dogs , but this man alone seemed to be a match for them all ."
"Again and again they closed upon him , and again and again he hewed a clear space ."
"He had lifted up one boy with his hook , and was using him as a buckler -LSB- shield -RSB- , when another , who had just passed his sword through Mullins , sprang into the fray ."
"Never a word they spoke as they pulled ashore , being stunned with the horror of that screaming ; but they had scarce set foot upon the beach when Hoseason woke up , as if out of a muse , and bade them lay hands upon Alan ."
"They hung back indeed , having little taste for the employment ; but Hoseason was like a fiend , crying that Alan was alone , that he had a great sum about him , that he had been the means of losing the brig and drowning all their comrades , and that here was both revenge and wealth upon a single cast ."
It was seven against one ; in that part of the shore there was no rock that Alan could set his back to ; and the sailors began to spread out and come behind him .
"`` And then , '' said Alan , `` the little man with the red head -- I havenae mind of the name that he is called . ''"
"`` Riach , '' said I. `` Ay '' said Alan , `` Riach !"
"Well , it was him that took up the clubs for me , asked the men if they werenae feared of a judgment , and , says he ` Dod , I 'll put my back to the Hielandman 's mysel ' . '"
"That 's none such an entirely bad little man , yon little man with the red head , '' said Alan ."
`` He has some spunks of decency . ''
"`` Well , '' said I , `` he was kind to me in his way . ''"
"`` And so he was to Alan , '' said he ; `` and by my troth , I found his way a very good one !"
"But ye see , David , the loss of the ship and the cries of these poor lads sat very ill upon the man ; and I 'm thinking that would be the cause of it . ''"
"`` Well , I would think so , '' says I ; `` for he was as keen as any of the rest at the beginning ."
But how did Hoseason take it ? ''
"`` It sticks in my mind that he would take it very ill , '' says Alan ."
"`` But the little man cried to me to run , and indeed I thought it was a good observe , and ran ."
"The last that I saw they were all in a knot upon the beach , like folk that were not agreeing very well together . ''"
`` What do you mean by that ? ''
"said I. `` Well , the fists were going , '' said Alan ; `` and I saw one man go down like a pair of breeks ."
But I thought it would be better no to wait .
"Ye see there 's a strip of Campbells in that end of Mull , which is no good company for a gentleman like me ."
"If it hadnae been for that I would have waited and looked for ye mysel ' , let alone giving a hand to the little man . ''"
"-LRB- It was droll how Alan dwelt on Mr. Riach 's stature , for , to say the truth , the one was not much smaller than the other . -RRB-"
"`` So , '' says he , continuing , `` I set my best foot forward , and whenever I met in with any one I cried out there was a wreck ashore ."
"Man , they didnae stop to fash with me !"
Ye should have seen them linking for the beach !
"And when they got there they found they had had the pleasure of a run , which is aye good for a Campbell ."
I 'm thinking it was a judgment on the clan that the brig went down in the lump and didnae break .
"But it was a very unlucky thing for you , that same ; for if any wreck had come ashore they would have hunted high and low , and would soon have found ye . ''"
"CHAPTER XIX THE HOUSE OF FEAR Night fell as we were walking , and the clouds , which had broken up in the afternoon , settled in and thickened , so that it fell , for the season of the year , extremely dark ."
"The way we went was over rough mountainsides ; and though Alan pushed on with an assured manner , I could by no means see how he directed himself ."
"At last , about half-past ten of the clock , we came to the top of a brae , and saw lights below us ."
"It seemed a house door stood open and let out a beam of fire and candle-light ; and all round the house and steading five or six persons were moving hurriedly about , each carrying a lighted brand ."
"If we had been allowed to sit idle , we should all have fallen in the blues , but Captain Smollett was never the man for that ."
"All hands were called up before him , and he divided us into watches ."
"The doctor and Gray and I for one ; the squire , Hunter , and Joyce upon the other ."
"Tired though we all were , two were sent out for firewood ; two more were set to dig a grave for Redruth ; the doctor was named cook ; I was put sentry at the door ; and the captain himself went from one to another , keeping up our spirits and lending a hand wherever it was wanted ."
"From time to time the doctor came to the door for a little air and to rest his eyes , which were almost smoked out of his head , and whenever he did so , he had a word for me ."
"`` That man Smollett , '' he said once , `` is a better man than I am ."
"And when I say that it means a deal , Jim . ''"
Another time he came and was silent for a while .
"Then he put his head on one side , and looked at me ."
`` Is this Ben Gunn a man ? ''
he asked .
"`` I do not know , sir , '' said I. `` I am not very sure whether he 's sane . ''"
"`` If there 's any doubt about the matter , he is , '' returned the doctor ."
"`` A man who has been three years biting his nails on a desert island , Jim , ca n't expect to appear as sane as you or me ."
It does n't lie in human nature .
Was it cheese you said he had a fancy for ? ''
"`` Yes , sir , cheese , '' I answered ."
"`` Well , Jim , '' says he , `` just see the good that comes of being dainty in your food ."
"You 've seen my snuff-box , have n't you ?"
"And you never saw me take snuff , the reason being that in my snuff-box I carry a piece of Parmesan cheese -- a cheese made in Italy , very nutritious ."
"Well , that 's for Ben Gunn ! ''"
Before supper was eaten we buried old Tom in the sand and stood round him for a while bare-headed in the breeze .
"A good deal of firewood had been got in , but not enough for the captain 's fancy , and he shook his head over it and told us we `` must get back to this tomorrow rather livelier . ''"
"Then , when we had eaten our pork and each had a good stiff glass of brandy grog , the three chiefs got together in a corner to discuss our prospects ."
"It appears they were at their wits ' end what to do , the stores being so low that we must have been starved into surrender long before help came ."
"But our best hope , it was decided , was to kill off the buccaneers until they either hauled down their flag or ran away with the HISPANIOLA ."
"From nineteen they were already reduced to fifteen , two others were wounded , and one at least -- the man shot beside the gun -- severely wounded , if he were not dead ."
"Every time we had a crack at them , we were to take it , saving our own lives , with the extremest care ."
"And besides that , we had two able allies -- rum and the climate ."
"As for the first , though we were about half a mile away , we could hear them roaring and singing late into the night ; and as for the second , the doctor staked his wig that , camped where they were in the marsh and unprovided with remedies , the half of them would be on their backs before a week ."
"`` So , '' he added , `` if we are not all shot down first they 'll be glad to be packing in the schooner ."
"It 's always a ship , and they can get to buccaneering again , I suppose . ''"
"`` Budge , you skulk ! ''"
cried Pew .
`` Dirk was a fool and a coward from the first -- you would n't mind him .
They must be close by ; they ca n't be far ; you have your hands on it .
"Scatter and look for them , dogs !"
"Oh , shiver my soul , '' he cried , `` if I had eyes ! ''"
"This appeal seemed to produce some effect , for two of the fellows began to look here and there among the lumber , but half-heartedly , I thought , and with half an eye to their own danger all the time , while the rest stood irresolute on the road ."
"`` You have your hands on thousands , you fools , and you hang a leg !"
"You 'd be as rich as kings if you could find it , and you know it 's here , and you stand there skulking ."
"There was n't one of you dared face Bill , and I did it -- a blind man !"
And I 'm to lose my chance for you !
"I 'm to be a poor , crawling beggar , sponging for rum , when I might be rolling in a coach !"
If you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch them still . ''
"`` Hang it , Pew , we 've got the doubloons ! ''"
grumbled one .
"`` They might have hid the blessed thing , '' said another ."
"`` Take the Georges , Pew , and do n't stand here squalling . ''"
"Squalling was the word for it ; Pew 's anger rose so high at these objections till at last , his passion completely taking the upper hand , he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded heavily on more than one ."
"These , in their turn , cursed back at the blind miscreant , threatened him in horrid terms , and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from his grasp ."
"This quarrel was the saving of us , for while it was still raging , another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the hamlet -- the tramp of horses galloping ."
"Almost at the same time a pistol-shot , flash and report , came from the hedge side ."
"And that was plainly the last signal of danger , for the buccaneers turned at once and ran , separating in every direction , one seaward along the cove , one slant across the hill , and so on , so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but Pew ."
"Him they had deserted , whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not ; but there he remained behind , tapping up and down the road in a frenzy , and groping and calling for his comrades ."
"Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few steps past me , towards the hamlet , crying , `` Johnny , Black Dog , Dirk , '' and other names , `` you wo n't leave old Pew , mates -- not old Pew ! ''"
"Just then the noise of horses topped the rise , and four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope ."
"At this Pew saw his error , turned with a scream , and ran straight for the ditch , into which he rolled ."
"But he was on his feet again in a second and made another dash , now utterly bewildered , right under the nearest of the coming horses ."
"The rider tried to save him , but in vain ."
Down went Pew with a cry that rang high into the night ; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by .
"He fell on his side , then gently collapsed upon his face and moved no more ."
I leaped to my feet and hailed the riders .
"They were pulling up , at any rate , horrified at the accident ; and I soon saw what they were ."
"`` We 'll never get ashore at this rate , '' said I. `` If it 's the only course that we can lie , sir , we must even lie it , '' returned the captain ."
`` We must keep upstream .
"You see , sir , '' he went on , `` if once we dropped to leeward of the landing-place , it 's hard to say where we should get ashore , besides the chance of being boarded by the gigs ; whereas , the way we go the current must slacken , and then we can dodge back along the shore . ''"
"`` The current 's less a ` ready , sir , '' said the man Gray , who was sitting in the fore-sheets ; `` you can ease her off a bit . ''"
"`` Thank you , my man , '' said I , quite as if nothing had happened , for we had all quietly made up our minds to treat him like one of ourselves ."
"Suddenly the captain spoke up again , and I thought his voice was a little changed ."
`` The gun ! ''
said he .
"`` I have thought of that , '' said I , for I made sure he was thinking of a bombardment of the fort ."
"`` They could never get the gun ashore , and if they did , they could never haul it through the woods . ''"
"`` Look astern , doctor , '' replied the captain ."
"We had entirely forgotten the long nine ; and there , to our horror , were the five rogues busy about her , getting off her jacket , as they called the stout tarpaulin cover under which she sailed ."
"Not only that , but it flashed into my mind at the same moment that the round-shot and the powder for the gun had been left behind , and a stroke with an axe would put it all into the possession of the evil ones abroad ."
"`` Israel was Flint 's gunner , '' said Gray hoarsely ."
"At any risk , we put the boat 's head direct for the landing-place ."
"By this time we had got so far out of the run of the current that we kept steerage way even at our necessarily gentle rate of rowing , and I could keep her steady for the goal ."
But the worst of it was that with the course I now held we turned our broadside instead of our stern to the HISPANIOLA and offered a target like a barn door .
I could hear as well as see that brandy-faced rascal Israel Hands plumping down a round-shot on the deck .
`` Who 's the best shot ? ''
asked the captain .
"`` Mr. Trelawney , out and away , '' said I. `` Mr. Trelawney , will you please pick me off one of these men , sir ?"
"Hands , if possible , '' said the captain ."
Trelawney was as cool as steel .
He looked to the priming of his gun .
"`` Now , '' cried the captain , `` easy with that gun , sir , or you 'll swamp the boat ."
All hands stand by to trim her when he aims . ''
"The squire raised his gun , the rowing ceased , and we leaned over to the other side to keep the balance , and all was so nicely contrived that we did not ship a drop ."
"They had the gun , by this time , slewed round upon the swivel , and Hands , who was at the muzzle with the rammer , was in consequence the most exposed ."
"However , we had no luck , for just as Trelawney fired , down he stooped , the ball whistled over him , and it was one of the other four who fell ."
"The cry he gave was echoed not only by his companions on board but by a great number of voices from the shore , and looking in that direction I saw the other pirates trooping out from among the trees and tumbling into their places in the boats ."
"`` Here come the gigs , sir , '' said I. `` Give way , then , '' cried the captain ."
`` We must n't mind if we swamp her now .
"Many times a shining stone at the bottom of the stream was taken for the slipper itself , and every evening saw a band of dripping downcast men returning homewards ."
"But one youth always lingered longer than the rest , and night would still see him engaged in the search , though his clothes stuck to his skin and his teeth chattered ."
"One day , when the king was lying on his bed racked with pain , he heard the noise of a scuffle going on in his antechamber , and rang a golden bell that stood by his side to summon one of his servants ."
"` Sire , ' answered the attendant , when the king inquired what was the matter , ` the noise you heard was caused by a young man from the town , who has had the impudence to come here to ask if he may measure your majesty 's foot , so as to make you another slipper in place of the lost one . '"
` And what have you done to the youth ? '
said the king .
"` The servants pushed him out of the palace , and , added a few blows to teach him not to be insolent , ' replied the man ."
"` Then they did very ill , ' answered the king , with a frown ."
"` He came here from kindness , and there was no reason to maltreat him . '"
"` Oh , my lord , he had the audacity to wish to touch your majesty 's sacred person -- he , a good-for-nothing boy , a mere shoemaker 's apprentice , perhaps !"
And even if he could make shoes to perfection they would be no use without the soothing balsam . '
"The king remained silent for a few moments , then he said : ` Never mind ."
Go and fetch the youth and bring him to me .
I would gladly try any remedy that may relieve my pain . '
"So , soon afterwards , the youth , who had not gone far from the palace , was caught and ushered into the king 's presence ."
"He was tall and handsome and , though he professed to make shoes , his manners were good and modest , and he bowed low as he begged the king not only to allow him to take the measure of his foot , but also to suffer him to place a healing plaster over the wound ."
"Balancin was pleased with the young man 's voice and appearance , and thought that he looked as if he knew what he was doing ."
"So he stretched out his bad foot which the youth examined with great attention , and then gently laid on the plaster ."
"Very shortly the ointment began to soothe the sharp pain , and the king , whose confidence increased every moment , begged the young man to tell him his name . '"
"I have no parents ; they died when I was six , sire , ' replied the youth , modestly ."
"` Everyone in the town calls me Gilguerillo , because , when I was little , I went singing through the world in spite of my misfortunes ."
Luckily for me I was born to be happy . '
` And you really think you can cure me ? '
asked the king .
"` Completely , my lord , ' answered Gilguerillo ."
` And how long do you think it will take ? '
"` It is not an easy task ; but I will try to finish it in a fortnight , ' replied the youth ."
A fortnight seemed to the king a long time to make one slipper .
But he only said : ` Do you need anything to help you ? '
"` Only a good horse , if your majesty will be kind enough to give me one , ' answered Gilguerillo ."
"And the reply was so unexpected that the courtiers could hardly restrain their smiles , while the king stared silently ."
"` You shall have the horse , ' he said at last , ` and I shall expect you back in a fortnight ."
Its name is Ben Alder .
"it is a wild , desert mountain full of hills and hollows , and if we can win to it before the morn , we may do yet . ''"
"`` But , Alan , '' cried I , `` that will take us across the very coming of the soldiers ! ''"
"`` I ken that fine , '' said he ; `` but if we are driven back on Appin , we are two dead men ."
"So now , David man , be brisk ! ''"
"With that he began to run forward on his hands and knees with an incredible quickness , as though it were his natural way of going ."
"All the time , too , he kept winding in and out in the lower parts of the moorland where we were the best concealed ."
"Some of these had been burned or at least scathed with fire ; and there rose in our faces -LRB- which were close to the ground -RRB- a blinding , choking dust as fine as smoke ."
"The water was long out ; and this posture of running on the hands and knees brings an overmastering weakness and weariness , so that the joints ache and the wrists faint under your weight ."
"Now and then , indeed , where was a big bush of heather , we lay awhile , and panted , and putting aside the leaves , looked back at the dragoons ."
"They had not spied us , for they held straight on ; a half-troop , I think , covering about two miles of ground , and beating it mighty thoroughly as they went ."
"I had awakened just in time ; a little later , and we must have fled in front of them , instead of escaping on one side ."
"Even as it was , the least misfortune might betray us ; and now and again , when a grouse rose out of the heather with a clap of wings , we lay as still as the dead and were afraid to breathe ."
"The aching and faintness of my body , the labouring of my heart , the soreness of my hands , and the smarting of my throat and eyes in the continual smoke of dust and ashes , had soon grown to be so unbearable that I would gladly have given up ."
Nothing but the fear of Alan lent me enough of a false kind of courage to continue .
"As for himself -LRB- and you are to bear in mind that he was cumbered with a great-coat -RRB- he had first turned crimson , but as time went on the redness began to be mingled with patches of white ; his breath cried and whistled as it came ; and his voice , when he whispered his observations in my ear during our halts , sounded like nothing human ."
"Yet he seemed in no way dashed in spirits , nor did he at all abate in his activity , so that I was driven to marvel at the man 's endurance ."
"At length , in the first gloaming of the night , we heard a trumpet sound , and looking back from among the heather , saw the troop beginning to collect ."
"A little after , they had built a fire and camped for the night , about the middle of the waste ."
At this I begged and besought that we might lie down and sleep .
`` There shall be no sleep the night ! ''
said Alan .
"`` From now on , these weary dragoons of yours will keep the crown of the muirland , and none will get out of Appin but winged fowls ."
"We got through in the nick of time , and shall we jeopard what we 've gained ?"
"Na , na , when the day comes , it shall find you and me in a fast place on Ben Alder . ''"
"`` Alan , '' I said , `` it 's not the want of will : it 's the strength that I want ."
"If I could , I would ; but as sure as I 'm alive I can not . ''"
"`` Very well , then , '' said Alan ."
`` I 'll carry ye . ''
"I looked to see if he were jesting ; but no , the little man was in dead earnest ; and the sight of so much resolution shamed me ."
`` Lead away ! ''
said I. `` I 'll follow . ''
"The country round was covered with forests , in which dwelt all kinds of wild beasts , and the young man and his companions used to spend whole days in hunting them , and he was the finest hunter of all the tribe ."
"One morning , when winter was coming on , the youth and his companions set off as usual to bring back some of the mountain goats and deer to be salted down , as he was afraid of a snow-storm ; and if the wind blew and the snow drifted the forest might be impassable for some weeks ."
"The old man and the wife , however , would not go out , but remained in the wigwam making bows and arrows ."
"It soon grew so cold in the forest that at last one of the men declared they could walk no more , unless they could manage to warm themselves ."
"` That is easily done , ' said the leader , giving a kick to a large tree ."
"Flames broke out in the trunk , and before it had burnt up they were as hot as if it had been summer ."
"Then they started off to the place where the goats and deer were to be found in the greatest numbers , and soon had killed as many as they wanted ."
"But the leader killed most , as he was the best shot ."
"` Now we must cut up the game and divide it , ' said he ; and so they did , each one taking his own share ; and , walking one behind the other , set out for the village ."
"But when they reached a great river the young man did not want the trouble of carrying his pack any further , and left it on the bank . '"
"I am going home another way , ' he told his companions ."
And taking another road he reached the village long before they did .
` Have you returned with empty hands ? '
"asked the old man , as his son opened the door ."
"` Have I ever done that , that you put me such a question ? '"
asked the youth .
"` No ; I have slain enough to feast us for many moons , but it was heavy , and I left the pack on the bank of the great river ."
"Give me the arrows , I will finish making them , and you can go to the river and bring home the pack ! '"
"So the old man rose and went , and strapped the meat on his shoulder ; but as he was crossing the ford the strap broke and the pack fell into the river ."
"He stooped to catch it , but it swirled past him ."
"He clutched again ; but in doing so he over-balanced himself and was hurried into some rapids , where he was knocked against some rocks , and he sank and was drowned , and his body was carried down the stream into smoother water when it rose to the surface again ."
"But by this time it had lost all likeness to a man , and was changed into a piece of wood ."
"The wood floated on , and the river got bigger and bigger and entered a new country ."
"There it was borne by the current close to the shore , and a woman who was down there washing her clothes caught it as it passed , and drew it out , saying to herself : ` What a nice smooth plank !"
I will use it as a table to put my food upon . '
And gathering up her clothes she took the plank with her into her hut .
"When her supper time came she stretched the board across two strings which hung from the roof , and set upon it the pot containing a stew that smelt very good ."
"The woman had been working hard all day and was very hungry , so she took her biggest spoon and plunged it into the pot ."
But what was her astonishment and disgust when both pot and food vanished instantly before her !
"` Oh , you horrid plank , you have brought me ill-luck ! '"
she cried .
And taking it up she flung it away from her .
You had better go there and look for it ; I have no more time to waste . '
And he went his way .
"So the wanderer turned his steps to the loft , which was at the top of the storehouse , and there he found the wooden chest , so old that it looked as if it were dropping to pieces ."
` What use is this old thing to me ? '
he said to himself .
"` Oh , well , it will serve to light a fire at which I can warm myself ; so things might be worse after all . '"
"Placing the chest on his back , the man , whose name was Jose , set out for his inn , and , borrowing a hatchet , began to chop up the box ."
"In doing so he discovered a secret drawer , and in it lay a paper ."
"He opened the paper , not knowing what it might contain , and was astonished to find that it was the acknowledgment of a large debt that was owing to his father ."
"Putting the precious writing in his pocket , he hastily inquired of the landlord where he could find the man whose name was written inside , and he ran out at once in search of him ."
"The debtor proved to be an old miser , who lived at the other end of the village ."
"He had hoped for many months that the paper he had written had been lost or destroyed , and , indeed , when he saw it , was very unwilling to pay what he owed ."
"However , the stranger threatened to drag him before the king , and when the miser saw that there was no help for it he counted out the coins one by one ."
"The stranger picked them up and put them in his pocket , and went back to his inn feeling that he was now a rich man ."
"A few weeks after this he was walking through the streets of the nearest town , when he met a poor woman crying bitterly ."
"He stopped and asked her what was the matter , and she answered between her sobs that her husband was dying , and , to make matters worse , a creditor whom he could not pay was anxious to have him taken to prison ."
"` Comfort yourself , ' said the stranger kindly ; ` they shall neither send your husband to prison nor sell your goods ."
"I will not only pay his debts but , if he dies , the cost of his burial also ."
"And now go home , and nurse him as well as you can . '"
"And so she did ; but , in spite of her care , the husband died , and was buried by the stranger ."
"But everything cost more than he expected , and when all was paid he found that only three gold pieces were left ."
` What am I to do now ? '
said he to himself . '
"I think I had better go to court , and enter into the service of the king . '"
"At first he was only a servant , who carried the king the water for his bath , and saw that his bed was made in a particular fashion ."
"But he did his duties so well that his master soon took notice of him , and in a short time he rose to be a gentleman of the bedchamber ."
"Now , when this happened the younger brother had spent all the money he had inherited , and did not know how to make any for himself ."
"He then bethought him of the king 's favourite , and went whining to the palace to beg that his brother , whom he had so ill-used , would give him his protection , and find him a place ."
"The elder , who was always ready to help everyone spoke to the king on his behalf , and the next day the young man took up is work at court ."
"Unfortunately , the new-comer was by nature spiteful and envious , and could not bear anyone to have better luck than himself ."
"By dint of spying through keyholes and listening at doors , he learned that the king , old and ugly though he was , had fallen in love with the Princess Bella-Flor , who would have nothing to say to him , and had hidden herself in some mountain castle , no one knew where ."
"` That will do nicely , ' thought the scoundrel , rubbing his hands ."
"cried he , as soon as he could speak ."
` Is the prince dead ? '
"faltered Muffette , growing white and cold ."
"` No , no ; but -- oh , how can I tell you ! '"
And he sank down on a pile of cushions while his wife and daughter knelt beside him .
"At length he was able to tell his tale , and a terrible one it was !"
"There had just arrived at court a huge giant , as ambassador from the dragon by whose help the king had rescued the queen and Muffette from the crystal palace ."
"The dragon had been very busy for many years past , and had quite forgotten the princess till the news of her betrothal reached his ears ."
Then he remembered the bargain he had made with her father ; and the more he heard of Muffette the more he felt sure she would make a delicious dish .
So he had ordered the giant who was his servant to fetch her at once .
No words would paint the horror of both the queen and the princess as they listened to this dreadful doom .
"They rushed instantly to the hall , where the giant was awaiting them , and flinging themselves at his feet implored him to take the kingdom if he would , but to have pity on the princess ."
"The giant looked at them kindly , for he was not at all hard-hearted , but said that he had no power to do anything , and that if the princess did not go with him quietly the dragon would come himself ."
"Several days went by , and the king and queen hardly ceased from entreating the aid of the giant , who by this time was getting weary of waiting ."
"` There is only one way of helping you , ' he said at last , ` and that is to marry the princess to my nephew , who , besides being young and handsome , has been trained in magic , and will know how to keep her safe from the dragon . '"
"` Oh , thank you , thank you ! '"
"cried the parents , clasping his great hands to their breasts ."
` You have indeed lifted a load from us .
She shall have half the kingdom for her dowry . '
But Muffette stood up and thrust them aside . '
"I will not buy my life with faithlessness , ' she said proudly ; ` and I will go with you this moment to the dragon 's abode . '"
And all her father 's and mother 's tears and prayers availed nothing to move her .
"The next morning Muffette was put into a litter , and , guarded by the giant and followed by the king and queen and the weeping maids of honour , they started for the foot of the mountain where the dragon had his castle ."
"The way , though rough and stony , seemed all too short , and when they reached the spot appointed by the dragon the giant ordered the men who bore the litter to stand still ."
"` It is time for you to bid farewell to your daughter , ' said he ; ` for I see the dragon coming to us . '"
"It was true ; a cloud appeared to pass over the sun , for between them and it they could all discern dimly a huge body half a mile long approaching nearer and nearer ."
"At first the king could not believe that this was the small beast who had seemed so friendly on the shore of the lake of quicksilver but then he knew very little of necromancy , and had never studied the art of expanding and contracting his body ."
"But it was the dragon and nothing else , whose six wings were carrying him forward as fast as might be , considering his great weight and the length of his tail , which had fifty twists and a half ."
"He came quickly , yes ; but the frog , mounted on a greyhound , and wearing her cap on her head , went quicker still ."
"Entering a room where the prince was sitting gazing at the portrait of his betrothed , she cried to him : ` What are you doing lingering here , when the life of the princess is nearing its last moment ?"
"In the courtyard you will find a green horse with three heads and twelve feet , and by its side a sword eighteen yards long ."
"Hasten , lest you should be too late ! '"
The prince next day did exactly as the princess had told him; and the minute the hair that was stretched down the edge of the hatchet-blade touched the tree-trunk it split into two pieces.
"The king said, ""Now you can marry my daughter."" Then the wedding took place. All the Rajas and kings of the countries round were asked to come to it, and there were great rejoicings. After a few days the prince's son said to his wife, ""Let us go to my father's country."" The Princess Labam's father gave them a quantity of camels and horses and rupees and servants; and they travelled in great state to the prince's country, where they lived happily."
"The prince always kept his bag, bowl, bed, and stick; only, as no one ever came to make war on him, he never needed to use the stick."
The Lambikin
"Once upon a time there was a wee wee Lambikin, who frolicked about on his little tottery legs, and enjoyed himself amazingly."
"Now one day he set off to visit his Granny, and was jumping with joy to think of all the good things he should get from her, when who should he meet but a Jackal, who looked at the tender young morsel and said: ""Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll EAT YOU!"""
But Lambikin only gave a little frisk and said:
"""To Granny's house I go,     Where I shall fatter grow,     Then you can eat me so."""
"The Jackal thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass."
"By-and-by he met a Vulture, and the Vulture, looking hungrily at the tender morsel before him, said: ""Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll EAT YOU!"""
"But Lambikin only gave a little frisk, and said:"
"""To Granny's house I go,     Where I shall fatter grow,     Then you can eat me so."""
"The Vulture thought this reasonable, and let Lambikin pass."
"And by-and-by he met a Tiger, and then a Wolf, and a Dog, and an Eagle, and all these, when they saw the tender little morsel, said:"
"""Lambikin! Lambikin! I'll EAT YOU!"""
"But to all of them Lambikin replied, with a little frisk:"
"""To Granny's house I go,     Where I shall fatter grow,     Then you can eat me so."""
"At last he reached his Granny's house, and said, all in a great hurry, ""Granny, dear, I've promised to get very fat; so, as people ought to keep their promises, please put me into the corn-bin at once."""
"So his Granny said he was a good boy, and put him into the corn-bin, and there the greedy little Lambikin stayed for seven days, and ate, and ate, and ate, until he could scarcely waddle, and his Granny said he was fat enough for anything, and must go home. But cunning little Lambikin said that would never do, for some animal would be sure to eat him on the way back, he was so plump and tender."
"""I'll tell you what you must do,"" said Master Lambikin, ""you must make a little drumikin out of the skin of my little brother who died, and then I can sit inside and trundle along nicely, for I'm as tight as a drum myself."""
"So his Granny made a nice little drumikin out of his brother's skin, with the wool inside, and Lambikin curled himself up snug and warm in the middle, and trundled away gaily. Soon he met with the Eagle, who called out:"
"""Drumikin! Drumikin!"
"Have you seen Lambikin?"""
"And Mr. Lambikin, curled up in his soft warm nest, replied:"
"""Fallen into the fire, and so will you     On little Drumikin.  Tum-pa, tum-too!"""
"""How very annoying!"" sighed the Eagle, thinking regretfully of the tender morsel he had let slip."
"Meanwhile Lambikin trundled along, laughing to himself, and singing:"
"""Tum-pa, tum-too;     Tum-pa, tum-too!"""
"""Just this one,"" cried Lionel, laying his hands on the cover of a great brown book that lay on the study table. It had gold patterns on the brown leather, and gold clasps with turquoises and rubies in the twists of them, and gold corners, so that the leather should not wear out too quickly."
"""I must look at this one,"" Lionel said, for on the back in big letters he read: The Book of Beasts."
"The Chancellor said, ""Don't be a silly little King."""
"But Lionel had got the gold clasps undone, and he opened the first page, and there was a beautiful Butterfly all red, and brown, and yellow, and blue, so beautifully painted that it looked as if it were alive."
"""There,"" said Lionel, ""Isn't that lovely? Why """
"But as he spoke the beautiful Butterfly fluttered its many-colored wings on the yellow old page of the book, and flew up and out of the window."
"""Well!"" said the Prime Minister, as soon as he could speak for the lump of wonder that had got into his throat and tried to choke him, ""that's magic, that is."""
"But before he had spoken, the King had turned the next page, and there was a shining bird complete and beautiful in every blue feather of him."
"Under him was written, ""Blue Bird of Paradise,"" and while the King gazed enchanted at the charming picture the Blue Bird fluttered his wings on the yellow page and spread them and flew out of the book."
"Then the Prime Minister snatched the book away from the King and shut it up on the blank page where the bird had been, and put it on a very high shelf. And the Chancellor gave the King a good shaking, and said:"
"""You're a naughty, disobedient little King!"" and was very angry indeed."
"""I don't see that I've done any harm,"" said Lionel. He hated being shaken, as all boys do; he would much rather have been slapped."
"""No harm?"" said the Chancellor. ""Ah but what do you know about it?"
"That's the question. How do you know what might have been on the next page a snake or a worm, or a centipede or a revolutionist, or something like that."""
"""Well, I'm sorry if I've vexed you,"" said Lionel. ""Come, let's kiss and be friends."" So he kissed the Prime Minister, and they settled down for a nice quiet game of noughts and crosses while the Chancellor went to add up his accounts."
"But when Lionel was in bed he could not sleep for thinking of the book, and when the full moon was shining with all her might and light he got up and crept down to the library and climbed up and got The Book of Beasts."
"He took it outside to the terrace, where the moonlight was as bright as day, and he opened the book, and saw the empty pages with ""Butterfly"""
"and ""Blue Bird of Paradise"" underneath, and then he turned the next page. There was some sort of red thing sitting under a palm tree, and under it was written ""Dragon."" The Dragon did not move, and the King shut up the book rather quickly and went back to bed."
"But the next day he wanted another look, so he took the book out into the garden, and when he undid the clasps with the rubies and turquoises, the book opened all by itself at the picture with ""Dragon"" underneath, and the sun shone full on the page. And then, quite suddenly, a great Red Dragon came out of the book and spread vast scarlet wings and flew away across the garden to the far hills, and Lionel was left with the empty page before him, for the page was quite empty except for the green palm tree and the yellow desert, and the little streaks of red where the paintbrush had gone outside the pencil outline of the Red Dragon."
"And then Lionel felt that he had indeed done it. He had not been King twenty-four hours, and already he had let loose a Red Dragon to worry his faithful subjects' lives out. And they had been saving up so long to buy him a crown, and everything!"
Lionel began to cry.
"The Chancellor and the Prime Minister and the Nurse all came running to see what was the matter. And when they saw the book they understood, and the Chancellor said: ""You naughty little King! Put him to bed, Nurse, and let him think over what he's done."""
"""Perhaps, my Lord,"" said the Prime Minister, ""we'd better first find out just exactly what he has done."""
"Then Lionel, in floods of tears, said: ""It's a Red Dragon, and it's gone flying away to the hills, and I am so sorry, and, oh, do forgive me!"""
"But the Prime Minister and the Chancellor had other things to think of than forgiving Lionel. They hurried off to consult the police and see what could be done. Everyone did what they could. They sat on committees and stood on guard, and lay in wait for the Dragon, but he stayed up in the hills, and there was nothing more to be done. The faithful Nurse, meanwhile, did not neglect her duty. Perhaps she did more than anyone else, for she slapped the King and put him to bed without his tea, and when it got dark she would not give him a candle to read by."
"""You are a naughty little King,"" she said, ""and nobody will love you."""
"Next day the Dragon was still quiet, though the more poetic of Lionel's subjects could see the redness of the Dragon shining through the green trees quite plainly. So Lionel put on his crown and sat on his throne and said he wanted to make some laws."
"And I need hardly say that though the Prime Minister and the Chancellor and the Nurse might have the very poorest opinion of Lionel's private judgement, and might even slap him and send him to bed, the minute he got on his throne and set his crown on his head, he became infallible which means that everything he said was right, and that he couldn't possibly make a mistake. So when he said: ""There is to be a law forbidding people to open books in schools or elsewhere"" he had the support of at least half of his subjects, and the other half the grown-up half pretended to think he was quite right."
Then he made a law that everyone should always have enough to eat. And this pleased everyone except the ones who had always had too much.
And when several other nice new laws were made and written down he went home and made mud-houses and was very happy. And he said to his Nurse:
"""People will love me now I've made such a lot of pretty new laws for them."""
"When the feast was over, the bridegroom and bride were conducted to their apartment, with music, and torches, and a great procession. As soon as the door was shut, the Lindworm turned to her and said, ""Fair maiden, shed a shift!"" The shepherd's daughter answered him, ""Prince Lindworm, slough a skin!"" ""No one has ever dared tell me to do that before!"" said he. ""But I command you to do it now!"" said she."
"Then he began to moan and wriggle: and in a few minutes a long snake-skin lay upon the floor beside him. The girl drew off her first shift, and spread it on top of the skin."
"The Lindworm said again to her, ""Fair maiden, shed a shift."""
"The shepherd's daughter answered him, ""Prince Lindworm, slough a skin."""
"""No one has ever dared tell me to do that before,"" said he. ""But I command you to do it now,"" said she. Then with groans and moans he cast off the second skin: and she covered it with her second shift."
"The Lindworm said for the third time, ""Fair maiden, shed a shift."""
"The shepherd's daughter answered him again, ""Prince Lindworm, slough a skin."" ""No one has ever dared tell me to do that before,"" said he, and his little eyes rolled furiously. But the girl was not afraid, and once more she commanded him to do as she bade."
"And so this went on until nine Lindworm skins were lying on the floor, each of them covered with a snow-white shift. And there was nothing left of the Lindworm but a huge thick mass, most horrible to see. Then the girl seized the whips, dipped them in the lye, and whipped him as hard as ever she could. Next, she bathed him all over in the fresh milk. Lastly, she dragged him on to the bed and put her arms round him. And she fell fast asleep that very moment."
"Next morning very early, the King and the courtiers came and peeped in through the keyhole. They wanted to know what had become of the girl, but none of them dared enter the room. However, in the end, growing bolder, they opened the door a tiny bit. And there they saw the girl, all fresh and rosy, and beside her lay no Lindworm, but the handsomest prince that any one could wish to see."
"The King ran out and fetched the Queen: and after that, there were such rejoicings in the castle as never were known before or since. The wedding took place all over again, much finer than the first, with festivals and banquets and merrymakings for days and weeks. No bride was ever so beloved by a King and Queen as this peasant maid from the shepherd's cottage. There was no end to their love and their kindness towards her: because, by her sense and her calmness and her courage, she had saved their son, Prince Lindworm."
THE LASSIE AND HER GODMOTHER
"Once on a time a poor couple lived far, far away in a great wood. The wife was brought to bed, and had a pretty girl, but they were so poor they did not know how to get the babe christened, for they had no money to pay the parson's fees. So one day the father went out to see if he could find any one who was willing to stand for the child and pay the fees; but though he walked about the whole day from one house to another, and though all said they were willing enough to stand, no one thought himself bound to pay the fees. Now, when he was going home again, a lovely lady met him, dressed so fine, and she looked so thoroughly good and kind; she offered to get the babe christened, but after that, she said, she must keep it for her own. The husband answered, he must first ask his wife what she wished to do; but when he got home and told his story, the wife said, right out, ""No!"""
"Next day the man went out again, but no one would stand if they had to pay the fees; and though he begged and prayed, he could get no help."
"And again as he went home, towards evening the same lovely lady met him, who looked so sweet and good, and she made him the same offer. So he told his wife again how he had fared, and this time she said, if he couldn't get any one to stand for his babe next day, they must just let the lady have her way, since she seemed so kind and good."
"The third day, the man went about, but he couldn't get any one to stand; and so when, towards evening, he met the kind lady again, he gave his word she should have the babe if she would only get it christened at the font. So next morning she came to the place where the man lived, followed by two men to stand godfathers, took the babe and carried it to church, and there it was christened. After that she took it to her own house, and there the little girl lived with her several years, and her Foster-mother was always kind and friendly to her."
"Now, when the Lassie had grown to be big enough to know right and wrong, her Foster-mother got ready to go on a journey."
"""You have my leave,"" she said, ""to go all over the house, except those rooms which I shew you;"" and when she had said that, away she went."
"But the Lassie could not forbear just to open one of the doors a little bit, when POP! out flew a Star."
"When her Foster-mother came back, she was very vexed to find that the star had flown out, and she got very angry with her Foster-daughter, and threatened to send her away; but the child cried and begged so hard that she got leave to stay."
"Now, after a while, the Foster-mother had to go on another journey; and, before she went, she forbade the Lassie to go into those two rooms into which she had never been. She promised to beware; but when she was left alone, she began to think and to wonder what there could be in the second room, and at last she could not help setting the door a little ajar, just to peep in, when POP! out flew the Moon."
"When her Foster-mother came home and found the moon let out, she was very downcast, and said to the Lassie she must go away, she could not stay with her any longer. But the Lassie wept so bitterly, and prayed so heartily for forgiveness, that this time, too, she got leave to stay."
"Some time after, the Foster-mother had to go away again, and she charged the Lassie, who by this time was half grown up, most earnestly that she mustn't try to go into, or to peep into, the third room. But when her Foster-mother had been gone some time, and the Lassie was weary of walking about alone, all at once she thought, ""Dear me, what fun it would be just to peep a little into that third room."" Then she thought she mustn't do it for her Foster-mother's sake; but when the bad thought came the second time she could hold out no longer; come what might, she must and would look into the room; so she just opened the door a tiny bit, when POP! out flew the Sun."
"But when her Foster-mother came back and saw that the sun had flown away, she was cut to the heart, and said, ""Now, there was no help for it, the Lassie must and should go away; she couldn't hear of her staying any longer."" Now the Lassie cried her eyes out, and begged and prayed so prettily; but it was all no good."
"""Nay! but I must punish you!"" said her Foster-mother; ""but you may have your choice, either to be the loveliest woman in the world, and not to be able to speak, or to keep your speech, and to be the ugliest of all women; but away from me you must go."""
"And the Lassie said, ""I would sooner be lovely."" So she became all at once wondrous fair; but from that day forth she was dumb."
"So, when she went away from her Foster-mother, she walked and wandered through a great, great wood; but the farther she went, the farther off the end seemed to be. So, when the evening came on, she clomb up into a tall tree, which grew over a spring, and there she made herself up to sleep that night. Close by lay a castle, and from that castle came early every morning a maid to draw water to make the Prince's tea, from the spring over which the Lassie was sitting. So the maid looked down into the spring, saw the lovely face in the water, and thought it was her own; then she flung away the pitcher, and ran home; and, when she got there, she tossed up her head and said, ""If I'm so pretty, I'm far too good to go and fetch water."""
"So another maid had to go for the water, but the same thing happened to her; she went back and said she was far too pretty and too good to fetch water from the spring for the Prince. Then the Prince went himself, for he had a mind to see what all this could mean. So, when he reached the spring, he too saw the image in the water; but he looked up at once, and became aware of the lovely Lassie who sate there up in the tree. Then he coaxed her down and took her home; and at last made up his mind to have her for his queen, because she was so lovely; but his mother, who was still alive, was against it."
"""She can't speak,"" she said, ""and maybe she's a wicked witch."""
"But the Prince could not be content till he got her. So after they had lived together a while, the Lassie was to have a child, and when the child came to be born, the Prince set a strong watch about her; but at the birth one and all fell into a deep sleep, and her Foster-mother came, cut the babe on its little finger, and smeared the queen's mouth with the blood; and said:"
150 The Old Beggar-Woman
"There was once an old woman, but thou hast surely seen an old woman go a-begging before now? This woman begged likewise, and when she got anything she said, “May God reward you.” The beggar-woman came to a door, and there by the fire a friendly rogue of a boy was standing warming himself. The boy said kindly to the poor old woman as she was standing shivering thus by the door, “Come, old mother, and warm yourself.” She came in, but stood too near the fire, so that her old rags began to burn, and she was not aware of it. The boy stood and saw that, but he ought to have put the flames out. Is it not true that he ought to have put them out? And if he had not any water, then should he have wept all the water in his body out of his eyes, and that would have supplied two pretty streams with which to extinguish them."
151 The Three Sluggards
"A certain King had three sons who were all equally dear to him, and he did not know which of them to appoint as his successor after his own death. When the time came when he was about to die, he summoned them to his bedside and said, “Dear children, I have been thinking of something which I will declare unto you; whichsoever of you is the laziest shall have the kingdom.” The eldest said, “Then, father, the kingdom is mine, for I am so idle that if I lie down to rest, and a drop falls in my eye, I will not open it that I may sleep.” The second said; “Father, the kingdom belongs to me, for I am so idle that when I am sitting by the fire warming myself, I would rather let my heel be burnt off than draw back my leg.” The third said, “Father, the kingdom is mine, for I am so idle that if I were going to be hanged, and had the rope already round my neck, and any one put a sharp knife into my hand with which I might cut the rope, I would rather let myself be hanged than raise my hand to the rope.” When the father heard that, he said, “Thou hast carried it the farthest, and shalt be King.”"
151* The Twelve Idle Servants
"Twelve servants who had done nothing all the day would not exert themselves at night either, but laid themselves on the grass and boasted of their idleness. The first said, “What is your laziness to me, I have to concern myself about mine own? The care of my body is my principal work, I eat not a little and drink still more. When I have had four meals, I fast a short time until I feel hunger again, and that suits me best. To rise betimes is not for me; when it is getting near mid-day, I already seek out a resting-place for myself. If the master call, I do exactly as if I had not heard him, and if he call for the second time, I wait awhile before I get up, and go to him very slowly."
In this way life is endurable.”
"The second said, “I have a horse to look after, but I leave the bit in his mouth, and if I do not want to do it, I give him no food, and I say he has had it already. I, however, lay myself in the oat-chest and sleep for four hours. After this I stretch out one foot and move it a couple of times over the horse’s body, and then he is combed and cleaned. Who is going to make a great business of that? Nevertheless service is too toilsome for me.”"
"The third said, “Why plague oneself with work? Nothing comes of it! I laid myself in the sun, and fell asleep. It began to rain a little, but why should I get up? I let it rain on in God’s name. At last came a splashing shower, so heavy indeed, that it pulled the hair out of my head and washed it away, and I got a hole in the skull; I put a plaster on it, and then it was all right. I have already had several injuries of that kind.”"
"The fourth said, “If I am to undertake a piece of work, I first loiter about for an hour that I may save up my strength. After that I begin quite slowly, and ask if no one is there who could help me. Then I let him do the chief of the work, and in reality only look on; but that also is still too much for me.”"
"The fifth said, “What does that matter? Just think, I am to take away the manure from the horse’s stable, and load the cart with it. I let it go on slowly, and if I have taken anything on the fork, I only half-raise it up, and then I rest just a quarter of an hour until I quite throw it in. It is enough and to spare if I take out a cartful in the day. I have no fancy for killing myself with work.”"
"The sixth said, “Shame on ye; I am afraid of no work, but I lie down for three weeks, and never once take my clothes off. What is the use of buckling your shoes on? For aught I care they may fall off my feet, it is no matter. If I am going up some steps, I drag one foot slowly after the other on to the first step, and then I count the rest of them that I may know where I must rest.”"
"The seventh said, “That will not do with me; my master looks after my work, only he is not at home the whole day. But I neglect nothing, I run as fast as it is possible to do when one crawls. If I am to get on, four sturdy men must push me with all their might. I came where six men were lying sleeping on a bed beside each other. I lay down by them and slept too. There was no wakening me again, and when they wanted to have me home, they had to carry me.” The eighth said, “I see plainly that I am the only active fellow; if a stone lie before me, I do not give myself the trouble to raise my legs and step over it. I lay myself down on the ground, and if I am wet and covered with mud and dirt, I stay lying until the sun has dried me again. At the very most, I only turn myself so that it can shine on me.” The ninth said, “That is the right way! To-day the bread was before me, but I was too idle to take it, and nearly died of hunger! Moreover a jug stood by it, but it was so big and heavy that I did not like to lift it up, and preferred bearing thirst. Just to turn myself round was too much for me, I remained lying like a log the whole day.” The tenth said, “Laziness has brought misfortune on me, a broken leg and swollen calf. Three of us were lying in the road, and I had my legs stretched out. Some one came with a cart, and the wheels went over me. I might indeed have drawn my legs back, but I did not hear the cart coming, for the midges were humming about my ears, and creeping in at my nose and out again at my mouth; who can take the trouble to drive the vermin away?”"
"The eleventh said, “I gave up my place yesterday. I had no fancy for carrying the heavy books to my master any longer or fetching them away again. There was no end of it all day long. But to tell the truth, he gave me my dismissal, and would not keep me any longer, for his clothes, which I had left lying in the dust, were all moth-eaten, and I am very glad of it.”"
"The twelfth said, “To-day I had to drive the cart into the country, and made myself a bed of straw on it, and had a good sleep. The reins slipped out of my hand, and when I awoke, the horse had nearly torn itself loose, the harness was gone, the strap which fastened the horse to the shafts was gone, and so were the collar, the bridle and bit."
"Some one had come by, who had carried all off. Besides this, the cart had got into a quagmire and stuck fast. I left it standing, and stretched myself on the straw again. At last the master came himself, and pushed the cart out, and if he had not come I should not be lying here but there, and sleeping in full tranquillity.”"
152 The Shepherd Boy
"There was once on a time a shepherd boy whose fame spread far and wide because of the wise answers which he gave to every question. The King of the country heard of it likewise, but did not believe it, and sent for the boy. Then he said to him, “If thou canst give me an answer to three questions which I will ask thee, I will look on thee as my own child, and thou shalt dwell with me in my royal palace.” The boy said, “What are the three questions?” The King said, “The first is, how many drops of water are there in the ocean?” The shepherd boy answered, “Lord King, if you will have all the rivers on earth dammed up so that not a single drop runs from them into the sea until I have counted it, I will tell you how many drops there are in the sea.” The King said, “The next question is, how many stars are there in the sky?” The shepherd boy said, “Give me a great sheet of white paper,” and then he made so many fine points on it with a pen that they could scarcely be seen, and it was all but impossible to count them; any one who looked at them would have lost his sight. Then he said, “There are as many stars in the sky as there are points on the paper; just count them.”"
"But no one was able to do it. The King said, “The third question is, how many seconds of time are there in eternity.” Then said the shepherd boy, “In Lower Pomerania is the Diamond Mountain, which is two miles and a half high, two miles and a half wide, and two miles and a half in depth; every hundred years a little bird comes and sharpens its beak on it, and when the whole mountain is worn away by this, then the first second of eternity will be over.”"
"The King said, “Thou hast answered the three questions like a wise man, and shalt henceforth dwell with me in my royal palace, and I will regard thee as my own child.”"
153 The Star-Money
"There was once on a time a little girl whose father and mother were dead, and she was so poor that she no longer had any little room to live in, or bed to sleep in, and at last she had nothing else but the clothes she was wearing and a little bit of bread in her hand which some charitable soul had given her. She was, however, good and pious."
"And as she was thus forsaken by all the world, she went forth into the open country, trusting in the good God. Then a poor man met her, who said, “Ah, give me something to eat, I am so hungry!” She reached him the whole of her piece of bread, and said, “May God bless it to thy use,” and went onwards. Then came a child who moaned and said, “My head is so cold, give me something to cover it with.” So she took off her hood and gave it to him; and when she had walked a little farther, she met another child who had no jacket and was frozen with cold. Then she gave it her own; and a little farther on one begged for a frock, and she gave away that also. At length she got into a forest and it had already become dark, and there came yet another child, and asked for a little shirt, and the good little girl thought to herself, “It is a dark night and no one sees thee, thou canst very well give thy little shirt away,” and took it off, and gave away that also. And as she so stood, and had not one single thing left, suddenly some stars from heaven fell down, and they were nothing else but hard smooth pieces of money, and although she had just given her little shirt away, she had a new one which was of the very finest linen. Then she gathered together the money into this, and was rich all the days of her life."
154 The Stolen Farthings
"A father was one day sitting at dinner with his wife and his children, and a good friend who had come on a visit was with them. And as they thus sat, and it was striking twelve o’clock, the stranger saw the door open, and a very pale child dressed in snow-white clothes came in. It did not look around, and it did not speak; but went straight into the next room. Soon afterwards it came back, and went out at the door again in the same quiet manner. On the second and on the third day, it came also exactly in the same way. At last the stranger asked the father to whom the beautiful child that went into the next room every day at noon belonged? “I have never seen it,” said he, neither did he know to whom it could belong. The next day when it again came, the stranger pointed it out to the father, who however did not see it, and the mother and the children also all saw nothing. On this the stranger got up, went to the room door, opened it a little, and peeped in. Then he saw the child sitting on the ground, and digging and seeking about industriously amongst the crevices between the boards of the floor, but when it saw the stranger, it disappeared. He now told what he had seen and described the child exactly, and the mother recognized it, and said, “Ah, it is my dear child who died a month ago.” They took up the boards and found two farthings which the child had once received from its mother that it might give them to a poor man; it, however, had thought, “Thou canst buy thyself a biscuit for that,” and had kept the farthings, and hidden them in the openings between the boards; and therefore it had had no rest in its grave, and had come every day at noon to seek for these farthings. The parents gave the money at once to a poor man, and after that the child was never seen again."
155 Brides On Their Trial
"There was once a young shepherd who wished much to marry, and was acquainted with three sisters who were all equally pretty, so that it was difficult to him to make a choice, and he could not decide to give the preference to any one of them. Then he asked his mother for advice, and she said, “Invite all three, and set some cheese before them, and watch how they eat it.” The youth did so; the first, however, swallowed the cheese with the rind on; the second hastily cut the rind off the cheese, but she cut it so quickly that she left much good cheese with it, and threw that away also; the third peeled the rind off carefully, and cut neither too much nor too little. The shepherd told all this to his mother, who said, “Take the third for thy wife.” This he did, and lived contentedly and happily with her."
156 Odds And Ends
"There was once on a time a maiden who was pretty, but idle and negligent. When she had to spin she was so out of temper that if there was a little knot in the flax, she at once pulled out a whole heap of it, and strewed it about on the ground beside her. Now she had a servant who was industrious, and gathered together the bits of flax which were thrown away, cleaned them, span them fine, and had a beautiful gown made out of them for herself. A young man had wooed the lazy girl, and the wedding was to take place. On the eve of the wedding, the industrious one was dancing merrily about in her pretty dress, and the bride said,—"
"“Ah, how that girl does jump about, dressed in my odds and ends.”"
"The bridegroom heard that, and asked the bride what she meant by it?"
"Then she told him that the girl was wearing a dress make of the flax which she had thrown away. When the bridegroom heard that, and saw how idle she was, and how industrious the poor girl was, he gave her up and went to the other, and chose her as his wife."
"When the wild man had once more reached the dark forest, he took the boy down from his shoulder, and said to him, “Thou wilt never see thy father and mother again, but I will keep thee with me, for thou hast set me free, and I have compassion on thee. If thou dost all I bid thee, thou shalt fare well. Of treasure and gold have I enough, and more than anyone in the world.” He made a bed of moss for the boy on which he slept, and the next morning the man took him to a well, and said, “Behold, the gold well is as bright and clear as crystal, thou shalt sit beside it, and take care that nothing falls into it, or it will be polluted. I will come every evening to see if thou hast obeyed my order.” The boy placed himself by the margin of the well, and often saw a golden fish or a golden snake show itself therein, and took care that nothing fell in. As he was thus sitting, his finger hurt him so violently that he involuntarily put it in the water. He drew it quickly out again, but saw that it was quite gilded, and whatsoever pains he took to wash the gold off again, all was to no purpose. In the evening Iron John came back, looked at the boy, and said, “What has happened to the well?” “Nothing, nothing,” he answered, and held his finger behind his back, that the man might not see it. But he said, “Thou hast dipped thy finger into the water, this time it may pass, but take care thou dost not again let anything go in.” By daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well and watching it. His finger hurt him again and he passed it over his head, and then unhappily a hair fell down into the well. He took it quickly out, but it was already quite gilded. Iron John came, and already knew what had happened. “Thou hast let a hair fall into the well,” said he. “I will allow thee to watch by it once more, but if this happens for the third time then the well is polluted, and thou canst no longer remain with me.”"
"On the third day, the boy sat by the well, and did not stir his finger, however much it hurt him. But the time was long to him, and he looked at the reflection of his face on the surface of the water. And as he still bent down more and more while he was doing so, and trying to look straight into the eyes, his long hair fell down from his shoulders into the water. He raised himself up quickly, but the whole of the hair of his head was already golden and shone like the sun. You may imagine how terrified the poor boy was! He took his pocket-handkerchief and tied it round his head, in order that the man might not see it. When he came he already knew everything, and said, “Take the handkerchief off.” Then the golden hair streamed forth, and let the boy excuse himself as he might, it was of no use. “Thou hast not stood the trial, and canst stay here no longer. Go forth into the world, there thou wilt learn what poverty is. But as thou hast not a bad heart, and as I mean well by thee, there is one thing I will grant thee; if thou fallest into any difficulty, come to the forest and cry, ‘Iron John,’ and then I will come and help thee. My power is great, greater than thou thinkest, and I have gold and silver in abundance.”"
"Then the King’s son left the forest, and walked by beaten and unbeaten paths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city. There he looked for work, but could find none, and he had learnt nothing by which he could help himself. At length he went to the palace, and asked if they would take him in. The people about court did not at all know what use they could make of him, but they liked him, and told him to stay. At length the cook took him into his service, and said he might carry wood and water, and rake the cinders together. Once when it so happened that no one else was at hand, the cook ordered him to carry the food to the royal table, but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen, he kept his little cap on. Such a thing as that had never yet come under the King’s notice, and he said, “When thou comest to the royal table thou must take thy hat off.” He answered, “Ah, Lord, I cannot; I have a bad sore place on my head.” Then the King had the cook called before him and scolded him, and asked how he could take such a boy as that into his service; and that he was to turn him off at once."
"The cook, however, had pity on him, and exchanged him for the gardener’s boy."
"And now the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig, and bear the wind and bad weather. Once in summer when he was working alone in the garden, the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the air might cool him. As the sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed so that the rays fell into the bed-room of the King’s daughter, and up she sprang to see what that could be. Then she saw the boy, and cried to him, “Boy, bring me a wreath of flowers.” He put his cap on with all haste, and gathered wild field-flowers and bound them together. When he was ascending the stairs with them, the gardener met him, and said, “How canst thou take the King’s daughter a garland of such common flowers? Go quickly, and get another, and seek out the prettiest and rarest.” “Oh, no,” replied the boy, “the wild ones have more scent, and will please her better.” When he got into the room, the King’s daughter said, “Take thy cap off, it is not seemly to keep it on in my presence.” He again said, “I may not, I have a sore head.” She, however, caught at his cap and pulled it off, and then his golden hair rolled down on his shoulders, and it was splendid to behold. He wanted to run out, but she held him by the arm, and gave him a handful of ducats. With these he departed, but he cared nothing for the gold pieces. He took them to the gardener, and said, “I present them to thy children, they can play with them.” The following day the King’s daughter again called to him that he was to bring her a wreath of field-flowers, and when he went in with it, she instantly snatched at his cap, and wanted to take it away from him, but he held it fast with both hands. She again gave him a handful of ducats, but he would not keep them, and gave them to the gardener for playthings for his children. On the third day things went just the same; she could not get his cap away from him, and he would not have her money."
"Not long afterwards, the country was overrun by war. The King gathered together his people, and did not know whether or not he could offer any opposition to the enemy, who was superior in strength and had a mighty army. Then said the gardener’s boy, “I am grown up, and will go to the wars also, only give me a horse.” The others laughed, and said, “Seek one for thyself when we are gone, we will leave one behind us in the stable for thee.” When they had gone forth, he went into the stable, and got the horse out; it was lame of one foot, and limped hobblety jig, hobblety jig; nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away to the dark forest. When he came to the outskirts, he called “Iron John,”"
"three times so loudly that it echoed through the trees. Thereupon the wild man appeared immediately, and said, “What dost thou desire?” “I want a strong steed, for I am going to the wars.” “That thou shalt have, and still more than thou askest for.” Then the wild man went back into the forest, and it was not long before a stable-boy came out of it, who led a horse that snorted with its nostrils, and could hardly be restrained, and behind them followed a great troop of soldiers entirely equipped in iron, and their swords flashed in the sun. The youth made over his three-legged horse to the stable-boy, mounted the other, and rode at the head of the soldiers. When he got near the battle-field a great part of the King’s men had already fallen, and little was wanting to make the rest give way. Then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers, broke like a hurricane over the enemy, and beat down all who opposed him. They began to fly, but the youth pursued, and never stopped, until there was not a single man left. Instead, however, of returning to the King, he conducted his troop by bye-ways back to the forest, and called forth Iron John. “What dost thou desire?” asked the wild man. “Take back thy horse and thy troops, and give me my three-legged horse again.” All that he asked was done, and soon he was riding on his three-legged horse. When the King returned to his palace, his daughter went to meet him, and wished him joy of his victory. “I am not the one who carried away the victory,” said he, “but a stranger knight who came to my assistance with his soldiers.” The daughter wanted to hear who the strange knight was, but the King did not know, and said, “He followed the enemy, and I did not see him again.” She inquired of the gardener where his boy was, but he smiled, and said, “He has just come home on his three-legged horse, and the others have been mocking him, and crying, “Here comes our hobblety jig back again!”"
"They asked, too, “Under what hedge hast thou been lying sleeping all the time?” He, however, said, “I did the best of all, and it would have gone badly without me.” And then he was still more ridiculed.”"
"The King said to his daughter, “I will proclaim a great feast that shall last for three days, and thou shalt throw a golden apple. Perhaps the unknown will come to it.” When the feast was announced, the youth went out to the forest, and called Iron John. “What dost thou desire?”"
"asked he. “That I may catch the King’s daughter’s golden apple.” “It is as safe as if thou hadst it already,” said Iron John. “Thou shalt likewise have a suit of red armour for the occasion, and ride on a spirited chestnut-horse.” When the day came, the youth galloped to the spot, took his place amongst the knights, and was recognized by no one."
"The King’s daughter came forward, and threw a golden apple to the knights, but none of them caught it but he, only as soon as he had it he galloped away."
"On the second day Iron John equipped him as a white knight, and gave him a white horse. Again he was the only one who caught the apple, and he did not linger an instant, but galloped off with it. The King grew angry, and said, “That is not allowed; he must appear before me and tell his name.” He gave the order that if the knight who caught the apple, should go away again they should pursue him, and if he would not come back willingly, they were to cut him down and stab him."
"On the third day, he received from Iron John a suit of black armour and a black horse, and again he caught the apple. But when he was riding off with it, the King’s attendants pursued him, and one of them got so near him that he wounded the youth’s leg with the point of his sword."
"The youth nevertheless escaped from them, but his horse leapt so violently that the helmet fell from the youth’s head, and they could see that he had golden hair. They rode back and announced this to the King."
The following day the King’s daughter asked the gardener about his boy.
"“He is at work in the garden; the queer creature has been at the festival too, and only came home yesterday evening; he has likewise shown my children three golden apples which he has won.”"
"The King had him summoned into his presence, and he came and again had his little cap on his head. But the King’s daughter went up to him and took it off, and then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders, and he was so handsome that all were amazed. “Art thou the knight who came every day to the festival, always in different colours, and who caught the three golden apples?” asked the King. “Yes,” answered he, “and here the apples are,” and he took them out of his pocket, and returned them to the King. “If you desire further proof, you may see the wound which your people gave me when they followed me. But I am likewise the knight who helped you to your victory over your enemies.” “If thou canst perform such deeds as that, thou art no gardener’s boy; tell me, who is thy father?” “My father is a mighty King, and gold have I in plenty as great as I require.” “I well see,” said the King, “that I owe thanks to thee; can I do anything to please thee?” “Yes,” answered he, “that indeed you can. Give me your daughter to wife.” The maiden laughed, and said, “He does not stand much on ceremony, but I have already seen by his golden hair that he was no gardener’s boy,” and then she went and kissed him. His father and mother came to the wedding, and were in great delight, for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear son again. And as they were sitting at the marriage-feast, the music suddenly stopped, the doors opened, and a stately King came in with a great retinue. He went up to the youth, embraced him and said, “I am Iron John, and was by enchantment a wild man, but thou hast set me free; all the treasures which I possess, shall be thy property.”"
137 The Three Black Princesses
"East India was besieged by an enemy who would not retire until he had received six hundred dollars. Then the townsfolk caused it to be proclaimed by beat of drum that whosoever was able to procure the money should be burgomaster. Now there was a poor fisherman who fished on the lake with his son, and the enemy came and took the son prisoner, and gave the father six hundred dollars for him. So the father went and gave them to the great men of the town, and the enemy departed, and the fisherman became burgomaster. Then it was proclaimed that whosoever did not say, “Mr. Burgomaster,” should be put to death on the gallows."
"The son got away again from the enemy, and came to a great forest on a high mountain. The mountain opened, and he went into a great enchanted castle, wherein chairs, tables, and benches were all hung with black."
"Then came three young princesses who were entirely dressed in black, but had a little white on their faces; they told him he was not to be afraid, they would not hurt him, and that he could deliver them. He said he would gladly do that, if he did but know how. At this, they told him he must for a whole year not speak to them and also not look at them, and what he wanted to have he was just to ask for, and if they dared give him an answer they would do so. When he had been there for a long while he said he should like to go to his father, and they told him he might go. He was to take with him this purse with money, put on this coat, and in a week he must be back there again."
"Then he was caught up, and was instantly in East India. He could no longer find his father in the fisherman’s hut, and asked the people where the poor fisherman could be, and they told him he must not say that, or he would come to the gallows. Then he went to his father and said, “Fisherman, how hast thou got here?” Then the father said, “Thou must not say that, if the great men of the town knew of that, thou wouldst come to the gallows.” He, however, would not stop, and was brought to the gallows. When he was there, he said, “O, my masters, just give me leave to go to the old fisherman’s hut.” Then he put on his old smock-frock, and came back to the great men, and said, “Do ye not now see? Am I not the son of the poor fisherman? Did I not earn bread for my father and mother in this dress?” Hereupon his father knew him again, and begged his pardon, and took him home with him, and then he related all that had happened to him, and how he had got into a forest on a high mountain, and the mountain had opened and he had gone into an enchanted castle, where all was black, and three young princesses had come to him who were black except a little white on their faces. And they had told him not to fear, and that he could deliver them. Then his mother said that might very likely not be a good thing to do, and that he ought to take a holy-water vessel with him, and drop some boiling water on their faces."
"He went back again, and he was in great fear, and he dropped the water on their faces as they were sleeping, and they all turned half-white."
"Then all the three princesses sprang up, and said, “Thou accursed dog, our blood shall cry for vengeance on thee! Now there is no man born in the world, nor will any ever be born who can set us free! We have still three brothers who are bound by seven chains they shall tear thee to pieces.” Then there was a loud shrieking all over the castle, and he sprang out of the window, and broke his leg, and the castle sank into the earth again, the mountain shut to again, and no one knew where the castle had stood."
138 Knoist and his Three Sons
"Between Werrel and Soist there lived a man whose name was Knoist, and he had three sons. One was blind, the other lame, and the third stark-naked. Once on a time they went into a field, and there they saw a hare. The blind one shot it, the lame one caught it, the naked one put it in his pocket. Then they came to a mighty big lake, on which there were three boats, one sailed, one sank, the third had no bottom to it. They all three got into the one with no bottom to it. Then they came to a mighty big forest in which there was a mighty big tree; in the tree was a mighty big chapel in the chapel was a sexton made of beech-wood and a box-wood parson, who dealt out holy-water with cudgels."
“How truly happy is that one Who can from holy water run!”
139 The Maid of Brakel
"A girl from Brakel once went to St. Anne’s Chapel at the foot of the Hinnenberg, and as she wanted to have a husband, and thought there was no one else in the chapel, she sang,"
"“Oh, holy Saint Anne!"
Help me soon to a man.
"Thou know’st him right well, By Suttmer gate does he dwell, His hair it is golden, Thou know’st him right well.”"
"“I must do everything thou biddest me,” said the little man. “Good,”"
said the soldier; “then in the first place help me out of this well.”
"The little man took him by the hand, and led him through an underground passage, but he did not forget to take the blue light with him. On the way the dwarf showed him the treasures which the witch had collected and hidden there, and the soldier took as much gold as he could carry."
"When he was above, he said to the little man, “Now go and bind the old witch, and carry her before the judge.” In a short time she, with frightful cries, came riding by, as swift as the wind on a wild tom-cat, nor was it long after that before the little man re-appeared."
"“It is all done,” said he, “and the witch is already hanging on the gallows. What further commands has my lord?” inquired the dwarf. “At this moment, none,” answered the soldier; “Thou canst return home, only be at hand immediately, if I summon thee.” “Nothing more is needed than that thou shouldst light thy pipe at the blue light, and I will appear before thee at once.” Thereupon he vanished from his sight."
"The soldier returned to the town from which he had come. He went to the best inn, ordered himself handsome clothes, and then bade the landlord furnish him a room as handsomely as possible. When it was ready and the soldier had taken possession of it, he summoned the little black mannikin and said, “I have served the King faithfully, but he has dismissed me, and left me to hunger, and now I want to take my revenge.” “What am I to do?” asked the little man. “Late at night, when the King’s daughter is in bed, bring her here in her sleep, she shall do servant’s work for me.” The mannikin said, “That is an easy thing for me to do, but a very dangerous thing for you, for if it is discovered, you will fare ill.” When twelve o’clock had struck, the door sprang open, and the mannikin carried in the princess. “Aha! art thou there?” cried the soldier, “get to thy work at once! Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber.” When she had done this, he ordered her to come to his chair, and then he stretched out his feet and said, “Pull off my boots for me,” and then he threw them in her face, and made her pick them up again, and clean and brighten them. She, however, did everything he bade her, without opposition, silently and with half-shut eyes. When the first cock crowed, the mannikin carried her back to the royal palace, and laid her in her bed."
"Next morning when the princess arose, she went to her father, and told him that she had had a very strange dream. “I was carried through the streets with the rapidity of lightning,” said she, “and taken into a soldier’s room, and I had to wait upon him like a servant, sweep his room, clean his boots, and do all kinds of menial work. It was only a dream, and yet I am just as tired as if I really had done everything.”"
"“The dream may have been true,” said the King, “I will give thee a piece of advice. Fill thy pocket full of peas, and make a small hole in it, and then if thou art carried away again, they will fall out and leave a track in the streets.” But unseen by the King, the mannikin was standing beside him when he said that, and heard all. At night when the sleeping princess was again carried through the streets, some peas certainly did fall out of her pocket, but they made no track, for the crafty mannikin had just before scattered peas in every street there was. And again the princess was compelled to do servant’s work until cock-crow."
"Next morning the King sent his people out to seek the track, but it was all in vain, for in every street poor children were sitting, picking up peas, and saying, “It must have rained peas, last night.” “We must think of something else,” said the King; “keep thy shoes on when thou goest to bed, and before thou comest back from the place where thou art taken, hide one of them there, I will soon contrive to find it.” The black mannikin heard this plot, and at night when the soldier again ordered him to bring the princess, revealed it to him, and told him that he knew of no expedient to counteract this stratagem, and that if the shoe were found in the soldier’s house it would go badly with him."
"“Do what I bid thee,” replied the soldier, and again this third night the princess was obliged to work like a servant, but before she went away, she hid her shoe under the bed."
"Next morning the King had the entire town searched for his daughter’s shoe. It was found at the soldier’s, and the soldier himself, who at the entreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate, was soon brought back, and thrown into prison. In his flight he had forgotten the most valuable things he had, the blue light and the gold, and had only one ducat in his pocket. And now loaded with chains, he was standing at the window of his dungeon, when he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by. The soldier tapped at the pane of glass, and when this man came up, said to him, “Be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle I have left lying in the inn, and I will give you a ducat for doing it.”"
"His comrade ran thither and brought him what he wanted. As soon as the soldier was alone again, he lighted his pipe and summoned the black mannikin. “Have no fear,” said the latter to his master. “Go wheresoever they take you, and let them do what they will, only take the blue light with you.” Next day the soldier was tried, and though he had done nothing wicked, the judge condemned him to death. When he was led forth to die, he begged a last favor of the King. “What is it?”"
"asked the King. “That I may smoke one more pipe on my way.” “Thou mayst smoke three,” answered the King, “but do not imagine that I will spare thy life.” Then the soldier pulled out his pipe and lighted it at the blue light, and as soon as a few wreaths of smoke had ascended, the mannikin was there with a small cudgel in his hand, and said, “What does my lord command?” “Strike down to earth that false judge there, and his constable, and spare not the King who has treated me so ill.”"
"Then the mannikin fell on them like lightning, darting this way and that way, and whosoever was so much as touched by his cudgel fell to earth, and did not venture to stir again. The King was terrified; he threw himself on the soldier’s mercy, and merely to be allowed to live at all, gave him his kingdom for his own, and the princess to wife."
117 The Wilful Child
"Once upon a time there was a child who was willful, and would not do at her mother wished. For this reason God had no pleasure in her, and let her become ill, and no doctor could do her any good, and in a short time she lay on her death-bed. When she had been lowered into her grave, and the earth was spread over her, all at once her arm came out again, and stretched upwards, and when they had put it in and spread fresh earth over it, it was all to no purpose, for the arm always came out again. Then the mother herself was obliged to go to the grave, and strike the arm with a rod, and when she had done that, it was drawn in, and then at last the child had rest beneath the ground."
118 The Three Army-Surgeons
"Three army-surgeons who thought they knew their art perfectly, were travelling about the world, and they came to an inn where they wanted to pass the night. The host asked whence they came, and whither they were going? “We are roaming about the world and practising our art.”"
"“Just show me for once in a way what you can do,” said the host. Then the first said he would cut off his hand, and put it on again early next morning; the second said he would tear out his heart, and replace it next morning; the third said he would cut out his eyes and heal them again next morning. “If you can do that,” said the innkeeper, “you have learnt everything.” They, however, had a salve, with which they rubbed themselves, which joined parts together, and they carried the little bottle in which it was, constantly with them. Then they cut the hand, heart and eyes from their bodies as they had said they would, and laid them all together on a plate, and gave it to the innkeeper. The innkeeper gave it to a servant who was to set it in the cupboard, and take good care of it. The girl, however, had a lover in secret, who was a soldier. When therefore the innkeeper, the three army-surgeons, and everyone else in the house were asleep, the soldier came and wanted something to eat. The girl opened the cupboard and brought him some food, and in her love forgot to shut the cupboard-door again; She seated herself at the table by her lover, and they chattered away together. While she sat so contentedly there, thinking of no ill luck, the cat came creeping in, found the cupboard open, took the hand and heart and eyes of the three army-surgeons, and ran off with them. When the soldier had done eating, and the girl was taking away the things and going to shut the cupboard she saw that the plate which the innkeeper had given her to take care of, was empty. Then she said in a fright to her lover, “Ah, miserable girl, what shall I do? The hand is gone, the heart and the eyes are gone too, what will become of me in the morning?” “Be easy,” said he, “I will help thee out of thy trouble there is a thief hanging outside on the gallows, I will cut off his hand. Which hand was it?” “The right one.” Then the girl gave him a sharp knife, and he went and cut the poor sinner’s right hand off, and brought it to her. After this he caught the cat and cut its eyes out, and now nothing but the heart was wanting. “Have you not been killing, and are not the dead pigs in the cellar?” said he. “Yes,” said the girl. “That’s well,” said the soldier, and he went down and fetched a pig’s heart. The girl placed all together on the plate, and put it in the cupboard, and when after this her lover took leave of her, she went quietly to bed."
"In the morning when the three army-surgeons got up, they told the girl she was to bring them the plate on which the hand, heart, and eyes were lying. Then she brought it out of the cupboard, and the first fixed the thief’s hand on and smeared it with his salve, and it grew to his arm directly. The second took the cat’s eyes and put them in his own head."
"The third fixed the pig’s heart firm in the place where his own had been, and the innkeeper stood by, admired their skill, and said he had never yet seen such a thing as that done, and would sing their praises and recommend them to everyone. Then they paid their bill, and travelled farther."
"As they were on their way, the one with the pig’s heart did not stay with them at all, but wherever there was a corner he ran to it, and rooted about in it with his nose as pigs do. The others wanted to hold him back by the tail of his coat, but that did no good; he tore himself loose, and ran wherever the dirt was thickest. The second also behaved very strangely; he rubbed his eyes, and said to the others, “Comrades, what is the matter? I don’t see at all. Will one of you lead me, so that I do not fall.” Then with difficulty they travelled on till evening, when they reached another inn. They went into the bar together, and there at a table in the corner sat a rich man counting money. The one with the thief’s hand walked round about him, made a sudden movement twice with his arm, and at last when the stranger turned away, he snatched at the pile of money, and took a handful from it. One of them saw this, and said, “Comrade, what art thou about? Thou must not steal shame on thee!” “Eh,” said he, “but how can I stop myself? My hand twitches, and I am forced to snatch things whether I will or not.”"
"After this, they lay down to sleep, and while they were lying there it was so dark that no one could see his own hand. All at once the one with the cat’s eyes awoke, aroused the others, and said. “Brothers, just look up, do you see the white mice running about there?” The two sat up, but could see nothing. Then said he, “Things are not right with us, we have not got back again what is ours. We must return to the innkeeper, he has deceived us.” They went back therefore, the next morning, and told the host they had not got what was their own again; that the first had a thief’s hand, the second cat’s eyes, and the third a pig’s heart. The innkeeper said that the girl must be to blame for that, and was going to call her, but when she had seen the three coming, she had run out by the backdoor, and not come back. Then the three said he must give them a great deal of money, or they would set his house on fire. He gave them what he had, and whatever he could get together, and the three went away with it. It was enough for the rest of their lives, but they would rather have had their own proper organs."
119 The Seven Swabians
"Seven Swabians were once together. The first was Master Schulz; the second, Jackli; the third, Marli; the fourth, Jergli; the fifth, Michal; the sixth, Hans; the seventh, Veitli: all seven had made up their minds to travel about the world to seek adventures, and perform great deeds. But in order that they might go in security and with arms in their hands, they thought it would be advisable that they should have one solitary, but very strong, and very long spear made for them."
"This spear all seven of them took in their hands at once; in front walked the boldest and bravest, and that was Master Schulz; all the others followed in a row, and Veitli was the last. Then it came to pass one day in the hay-making month (July), when they had walked a long distance, and still had a long way to go before they reached the village where they were to pass the night, that as they were in a meadow in the twilight a great beetle or hornet flew by them from behind a bush, and hummed in a menacing manner. Master Schulz was so terrified that he all but dropped the spear, and a cold perspiration broke out over his whole body. “Hark! hark!” cried he to his comrades, “Good heavens! I hear a drum.” Jackli, who was behind him holding the spear, and who perceived some kind of a smell, said, “Something is most certainly going on, for I taste powder and matches.” At these words Master Schulz began to take to flight, and in a trice jumped over a hedge, but as he just happened to jump on to the teeth of a rake which had been left lying there after the hay-making, the handle of it struck against his face and gave him a tremendous blow. “Oh dear! Oh dear!”"
screamed Master Schulz. “Take me prisoner; I surrender! I surrender!”
"The other six all leapt over, one on the top of the other, crying, “If you surrender, I surrender too! If you surrender, I surrender too!” At length, as no enemy was there to bind and take them away, they saw that they had been mistaken, and in order that the story might not be known, and they be treated as fools and ridiculed, they all swore to each other to hold their peace about it until one of them accidentally spoke of it. Then they journeyed onwards. The second danger which they survived cannot be compared with the first. Some days afterwards, their path led them through a fallow-field where a hare was sitting sleeping in the sun. Her ears were standing straight up, and her great glassy eyes were wide open. All of them were alarmed at the sight of the horrible wild beast, and they consulted together as to what it would be the least dangerous to do. For if they were to run away, they knew that the monster would pursue and swallow them whole. So they said, “We must go through a great and dangerous struggle. Boldly ventured, is half won,” and all seven grasped the spear, Master Schulz in front, and Veitli behind. Master Schulz was always trying to keep the spear back, but Veitli had become quite brave while behind, and wanted to dash forward and cried,"
"“Strike home, in every Swabian’s name, Or else I wish ye may be lame.”"
"But Hans knew how to meet this, and said,"
"“Thunder and lightning, it’s fine to prate, But for dragon-hunting thou’rt aye too late.”"
"Michal cried,"
184 The Nail
"A merchant had done good business at the fair; he had sold his wares, and lined his money-bags with gold and silver. Then he wanted to travel homewards, and be in his own house before nightfall. So he packed his trunk with the money on his horse, and rode away."
"At noon he rested in a town, and when he wanted to go farther the stable-boy brought out his horse and said, “A nail is wanting, sir, in the shoe of its left hind foot.” “Let it be wanting,” answered the merchant; “the shoe will certainly stay on for the six miles I have still to go. I am in a hurry.”"
"In the afternoon, when he once more alighted and had his horse fed, the stable-boy went into the room to him and said, “Sir, a shoe is missing from your horse’s left hind foot. Shall I take him to the blacksmith?”"
"“Let it still be wanting,” answered the man; “the horse can very well hold out for the couple of miles which remain. I am in haste.”"
"He rode forth, but before long the horse began to limp. It had not limped long before it began to stumble, and it had not stumbled long before it fell down and broke its leg. The merchant was forced to leave the horse where it was, and unbuckle the trunk, take it on his back, and go home on foot. And there he did not arrive until quite late at night. “And that unlucky nail,” said he to himself, “has caused all this disaster.”"
Hasten slowly.
185 The Poor Boy in the Grave
"There was once a poor shepherd-boy whose father and mother were dead, and he was placed by the authorities in the house of a rich man, who was to feed him and bring him up. The man and his wife, had however, bad hearts, and were greedy and anxious about their riches, and vexed whenever any one put a morsel of their bread in his mouth. The poor young fellow might do what he liked, he got little to eat, but only so many blows the more."
"One day he had to watch a hen and her chickens, but she ran through a quick-set hedge with them, and a hawk darted down instantly, and carried her off through the air. The boy called, “Thief! thief!"
rascal!” with all the strength of his body. But what good did that do?
"The hawk did not bring its prey back again. The man heard the noise, and ran to the spot, and as soon as he saw that his hen was gone, he fell in a rage, and gave the boy such a beating that he could not stir for two days. Then he had to take care of the chickens without the hen, but now his difficulty was greater, for one ran here and the other there. He thought he was doing a very wise thing when he tied them all together with a string, because then the hawk would not be able to steal any of them away from him. But he was very much mistaken. After two days, worn out with running about and hunger, he fell asleep; the bird of prey came, and seized one of the chickens, and as the others were tied fast to it, it carried them all off together, perched itself on a tree, and devoured them. The farmer was just coming home, and when he saw the misfortune, he got angry and beat the boy so unmercifully that he was forced to lie in bed for several days."
"When he was on his legs again, the farmer said to him, “Thou art too stupid for me, I cannot make a herdsman of thee, thou must go as errand-boy.” Then he sent him to the judge, to whom he was to carry a basketful of grapes, and he gave him a letter as well. On the way hunger and thirst tormented the unhappy boy so violently that he ate two of the bunches of grapes. He took the basket to the judge, but when the judge had read the letter, and counted the bunches he said, “Two clusters are wanting.” The boy confessed quite honestly that, driven by hunger and thirst, he had devoured the two which were wanting. The judge wrote a letter to the farmer, and asked for the same number of grapes again. These also the boy had to take to him with a letter. As he again was so extremely hungry and thirsty, he could not help it, and again ate two bunches. But first he took the letter out of the basket, put it under a stone and seated himself thereon in order that the letter might not see and betray him. The judge, however, again made him give an explanation about the missing bunches. “Ah,” said the boy, “how have you learnt that? The letter could not know about it, for I put it under a stone before I did it.” The judge could not help laughing at the boy’s simplicity, and sent the man a letter wherein he cautioned him to keep the poor boy better, and not let him want for meat and drink, and also that he was to teach him what was right and what was wrong."
"“I will soon show thee the difference,” said the hard man, “if thou wilt eat, thou must work, and if thou dost anything wrong, thou shalt be quite sufficiently taught by blows.”"
"The next day he set him a hard task. He was to chop two bundles of straw for food for the horses, and then the man threatened: “In five hours,” said he, “I shall be back again, and if the straw is not cut to chaff by that time, I will beat thee until thou canst not move a limb.”"
"The farmer went with his wife, the man-servant and the girl, to the yearly fair, and left nothing behind for the boy but a small bit of bread. The boy seated himself on the bench, and began to work with all his might. As he got warm over it he put his little coat off and threw it on the straw. In his terror lest he should not get done in time he kept constantly cutting, and in his haste, without noticing it, he chopped his little coat as well as the straw. He became aware of the misfortune too late; there was no repairing it. “Ah,” cried he, “now all is over with me! The wicked man did not threaten me for nothing; if he comes back and sees what I have done, he will kill me. Rather than that I will take my own life.”"
"The boy had once heard the farmer’s wife say, “I have a pot with poison in it under my bed.” She, however, had only said that to keep away greedy people, for there was honey in it. The boy crept under the bed, brought out the pot, and ate all that was in it. “I do not know,” said he, “folks say death is bitter, but it tastes very sweet to me. It is no wonder that the farmer’s wife has so often longed for death.” He seated himself in a little chair, and was prepared to die. But instead of becoming weaker he felt himself strengthened by the nourishing food."
"“It cannot have been poison,” thought he, “but the farmer once said there was a small bottle of poison for flies in the box in which he keeps his clothes; that, no doubt, will be the true poison, and bring death to me.” It was, however, no poison for flies, but Hungarian wine."
"The boy got out the bottle, and emptied it. “This death tastes sweet too,” said he, but shortly after when the wine began to mount into his brain and stupefy him, he thought his end was drawing near. “I feel that I must die,” said he, “I will go away to the churchyard, and seek a grave.” He staggered out, reached the churchyard, and laid himself in a newly dug grave. He lost his senses more and more. In the neighbourhood was an inn where a wedding was being kept; when he heard the music, he fancied he was already in Paradise, until at length he lost all consciousness. The poor boy never awoke again; the heat of the strong wine and the cold night-dew deprived him of life, and he remained in the grave in which he had laid himself."
"When the farmer heard the news of the boy’s death he was terrified, and afraid of being brought to justice indeed, his distress took such a powerful hold of him that he fell fainting to the ground. His wife, who was standing on the hearth with a pan of hot fat, ran to him to help him. But the flames darted against the pan, the whole house caught fire, in a few hours it lay in ashes, and the rest of the years they had to live they passed in poverty and misery, tormented by the pangs of conscience."
186 The True Sweethearts
"There was once on a time a girl who was young and beautiful, but she had lost her mother when she was quite a child, and her step-mother did all she could to make the girl’s life wretched. Whenever this woman gave her anything to do, she worked at it indefatigably, and did everything that lay in her power. Still she could not touch the heart of the wicked woman by that; she was never satisfied; it was never enough. The harder the girl worked, the more work was put upon her, and all that the woman thought of was how to weigh her down with still heavier burdens, and make her life still more miserable."
"One day she said to her, “Here are twelve pounds of feathers which thou must pick, and if they are not done this evening, thou mayst expect a good beating. Dost thou imagine thou art to idle away the whole day?”"
"The poor girl sat down to the work, but tears ran down her cheeks as she did so, for she saw plainly enough that it was quite impossible to finish the work in one day. Whenever she had a little heap of feathers lying before her, and she sighed or smote her hands together in her anguish, they flew away, and she had to pick them out again, and begin her work anew. Then she put her elbows on the table, laid her face in her two hands, and cried, “Is there no one, then, on God’s earth to have pity on me?” Then she heard a low voice which said, “Be comforted, my child, I have come to help thee.” The maiden looked up, and an old woman was by her side. She took the girl kindly by the hand, and said, “Only tell me what is troubling thee.” As she spoke so kindly, the girl told her of her miserable life, and how one burden after another was laid upon her, and she never could get to the end of the work which was given to her. “If I have not done these feathers by this evening, my step-mother will beat me; she has threatened she will, and I know she keeps her word.” Her tears began to flow again, but the good old woman said, “Do not be afraid, my child; rest a while, and in the meantime I will look to thy work.” The girl lay down on her bed, and soon fell asleep. The old woman seated herself at the table with the feathers, and how they did fly off the quills, which she scarcely touched with her withered hands! The twelve pounds were soon finished, and when the girl awoke, great snow-white heaps were lying, piled up, and everything in the room was neatly cleared away, but the old woman had vanished."
"The maiden thanked God, and sat still till evening came, when the step-mother came in and marvelled to see the work completed. “Just look, you awkward creature,” said she, “what can be done when people are industrious; and why couldst thou not set about something else?"
"There thou sittest with thy hands crossed.” When she went out she said, “The creature is worth more than her salt. I must give her some work that is still harder.”"
"Next morning she called the girl, and said, “There is a spoon for thee; with that thou must empty out for me the great pond which is beside the garden, and if it is not done by night, thou knowest what will happen.”"
"The girl took the spoon, and saw that it was full of holes; but even if it had not been, she never could have emptied the pond with it. She set to work at once, knelt down by the water, into which her tears were falling, and began to empty it. But the good old woman appeared again, and when she learnt the cause of her grief, she said, “Be of good cheer, my child. Go into the thicket and lie down and sleep; I will soon do thy work.” As soon as the old woman was alone, she barely touched the pond, and a vapour rose up on high from the water, and mingled itself with the clouds. Gradually the pond was emptied, and when the maiden awoke before sunset and came thither, she saw nothing but the fishes which were struggling in the mud. She went to her step-mother, and showed her that the work was done. “It ought to have been done long before this,” said she, and grew white with anger, but she meditated something new."
"On the third morning she said to the girl, “Thou must build me a castle on the plain there, and it must be ready by the evening.” The maiden was dismayed, and said, “How can I complete such a great work?” “I will endure no opposition,” screamed the step-mother. “If thou canst empty a pond with a spoon that is full of holes, thou canst build a castle too."
"I will take possession of it this very day, and if anything is wanting, even if it be the most trifling thing in the kitchen or cellar, thou knowest what lies before thee!” She drove the girl out, and when she entered the valley, the rocks were there, piled up one above the other, and all her strength would not have enabled her even to move the very smallest of them. She sat down and wept, and still she hoped the old woman would help her. The old woman was not long in coming; she comforted her and said, “Lie down there in the shade and sleep, and I will soon build the castle for thee. If it would be a pleasure to thee, thou canst live in it thyself.” When the maiden had gone away, the old woman touched the gray rocks. They began to rise, and immediately moved together as if giants had built the walls; and on these the building arose, and it seemed as if countless hands were working invisibly, and placing one stone upon another. There was a dull heavy noise from the ground; pillars arose of their own accord on high, and placed themselves in order near each other. The tiles laid themselves in order on the roof, and when noon-day came, the great weather-cock was already turning itself on the summit of the tower, like a golden figure of the Virgin with fluttering garments. The inside of the castle was being finished while evening was drawing near. How the old woman managed it, I know not; but the walls of the rooms were hung with silk and velvet, embroidered chairs were there, and richly ornamented arm-chairs by marble tables; crystal chandeliers hung down from the ceilings, and mirrored themselves in the smooth pavement; green parrots were there in gilt cages, and so were strange birds which sang most beautifully, and there was on all sides as much magnificence as if a king were going to live there. The sun was just setting when the girl awoke, and the brightness of a thousand lights flashed in her face. She hurried to the castle, and entered by the open door. The steps were spread with red cloth, and the golden balustrade beset with flowering trees. When she saw the splendour of the apartment, she stood as if turned to stone."
"Who knows how long she might have stood there if she had not remembered the step-mother? “Alas!” she said to herself, “if she could but be satisfied at last, and would give up making my life a misery to me.”"
"The girl went and told her that the castle was ready. “I will move into it at once,” said she, and rose from her seat. When they entered the castle, she was forced to hold her hand before her eyes, the brilliancy of everything was so dazzling. “Thou seest,” said she to the girl, “how easy it has been for thee to do this; I ought to have given thee something harder.” She went through all the rooms, and examined every corner to see if anything was wanting or defective; but she could discover nothing. “Now we will go down below,” said she, looking at the girl with malicious eyes. “The kitchen and the cellar still have to be examined, and if thou hast forgotten anything thou shalt not escape thy punishment.” But the fire was burning on the hearth, and the meat was cooking in the pans, the tongs and shovel were leaning against the wall, and the shining brazen utensils all arranged in sight. Nothing was wanting, not even a coal-box and water-pail. “Which is the way to the cellar?” she cried. “If that is not abundantly filled, it shall go ill with thee.” She herself raised up the trap-door and descended; but she had hardly made two steps before the heavy trap-door which was only laid back, fell down. The girl heard a scream, lifted up the door very quickly to go to her aid, but she had fallen down, and the girl found her lying lifeless at the bottom."
"The beams groaned as if they were being torn out of their joints, it seemed as if the staircase were falling down, and at length there was a crash as if the entire roof had fallen in. As, however, all grew quiet once more, and the girl was not hurt, she stayed quietly lying where she was, and fell asleep again. But when she woke up in the morning with the brilliancy of the sunshine, what did her eyes behold? She was lying in a vast hall, and everything around her shone with royal splendor; on the walls, golden flowers grew up on a ground of green silk, the bed was of ivory, and the canopy of red velvet, and on a chair close by, was a pair of shoes embroidered with pearls. The girl believed that she was in a dream, but three richly clad attendants came in, and asked what orders she would like to give? “If you will go,” she replied, “I will get up at once and make ready some soup for the old man, and then I will feed the pretty little hen, and the cock, and the beautiful brindled cow.” She thought the old man was up already, and looked round at his bed; he, however, was not lying in it, but a stranger. And while she was looking at him, and becoming aware that he was young and handsome, he awoke, sat up in bed, and said, “I am a King’s son, and was bewitched by a wicked witch, and made to live in this forest, as an old gray-haired man; no one was allowed to be with me but my three attendants in the form of a cock, a hen, and a brindled cow. The spell was not to be broken until a girl came to us whose heart was so good that she showed herself full of love, not only towards mankind, but towards animals—and that thou hast done, and by thee at midnight we were set free, and the old hut in the forest was changed back again into my royal palace.” And when they had arisen, the King’s son ordered the three attendants to set out and fetch the father and mother of the girl to the marriage feast. “But where are my two sisters?” inquired the maiden. “I have locked them in the cellar, and to-morrow they shall be led into the forest, and shall live as servants to a charcoal-burner, until they have grown kinder, and do not leave poor animals to suffer hunger.”"
170 Sharing Joy and Sorrow
"There was once a tailor, who was a quarrelsome fellow, and his wife, who was good, industrious, and pious, never could please him. Whatever she did, he was not satisfied, but grumbled and scolded, and knocked her about and beat her. As the authorities at last heard of it, they had him summoned, and put in prison in order to make him better. He was kept for a while on bread and water, and then set free again. He was forced, however, to promise not to beat his wife any more, but to live with her in peace, and share joy and sorrow with her, as married people ought to do. All went on well for a time, but then he fell into his old ways, and was surly and quarrelsome. And because he dared not beat her, he would seize her by the hair and tear it out. The woman escaped from him, and sprang out into the yard, but he ran after her with his yard-measure and scissors, and chased her about, and threw the yard-measure and scissors at her, and whatever else came his way. When he hit her he laughed, and when he missed her, he stormed and swore."
This went on so long that the neighbors came to the wife’s assistance.
"The tailor was again summoned before the magistrates, and reminded of his promise. “Dear gentlemen,” said he, “I have kept my word, I have not beaten her, but have shared joy and sorrow with her.” “How can that be,” said the judge, “when she continually brings such heavy complaints against you?” “I have not beaten her, but just because she looked so strange I wanted to comb her hair with my hand; she, however, got away from me, and left me quite spitefully. Then I hurried after her, and in order to bring her back to her duty, I threw at her as a well-meant admonition whatever came readily to hand. I have shared joy and sorrow with her also, for whenever I hit her I was full of joy, and she of sorrow, and if I missed her, then she was joyful, and I sorry.” The judges were not satisfied with this answer, but gave him the reward he deserved."
171 The Willow-Wren
"In former days every sound still had its meaning and application. When the smith’s hammer resounded, it cried, “Strike away! strike away.”"
"When the carpenter’s plane grated, it said, “Here goes! here goes.” If the mill wheel began to clack, it said, “Help, Lord God! help, Lord God!” And if the miller was a cheat and happened to leave the mill, it spoke high German, and first asked slowly, “Who is there? Who is there?” and then answered quickly, “The miller! the miller!” and at last quite in a hurry, “He steals bravely! he steals bravely! three pecks in a bushel.”"
"At this time the birds also had their own language which every one understood; now it only sounds like chirping, screeching, and whistling, and to some like music without words. It came into the bird’s mind, however, that they would no longer be without a ruler, and would choose one of themselves to be their King. One alone amongst them, the green plover, was opposed to this. He had lived free, and would die free, and anxiously flying hither and thither, he cried, “Where shall I go? where shall I go?” He retired into a solitary and unfrequented marsh, and showed himself no more among his fellows."
"The birds now wished to discuss the matter, and on a fine May morning they all gathered together from the woods and fields: eagles and chaffinches, owls and crows, larks and sparrows, how can I name them all? Even the cuckoo came, and the hoopoe, his clerk, who is so called because he is always heard a few days before him, and a very small bird which as yet had no name, mingled with the band. The hen, which by some accident had heard nothing of the whole matter, was astonished at the great assemblage. “What, what, what is going to be done?” she cackled; but the cock calmed his beloved hen, and said, “Only rich people,” and told her what they had on hand. It was decided, however, that the one who could fly the highest should be King. A tree-frog which was sitting among the bushes, when he heard that, cried a warning, “No, no, no!"
"no!” because he thought that many tears would be shed because of this; but the crow said, “Caw, caw,” and that all would pass off peaceably."
"It was now determined that on this fine morning they should at once begin to ascend, so that hereafter no one should be able to say, “I could easily have flown much higher, but the evening came on, and I could do no more.” On a given signal, therefore, the whole troop rose up in the air. The dust ascended from the land, and there was tremendous fluttering and whirring and beating of wings, and it looked as if a black cloud was rising up. The little birds were, however, soon left behind. They could go no farther, and fell back to the ground. The larger birds held out longer, but none could equal the eagle, who mounted so high that he could have picked the eyes out of the sun. And when he saw that the others could not get up to him, he thought, “Why shouldst thou fly still higher, thou art the King?” and began to let himself down again. The birds beneath him at once cried to him. “Thou must be our King, no one has flown so high as thou.” “Except me,”"
"screamed the little fellow without a name, who had crept into the breast-feathers of the eagle. And as he was not at all tired, he rose up and mounted so high that he reached heaven itself. When, however, he had gone as far as this, he folded his wings together, and called down with clear and penetrating voice, “I am King! I am King.”"
"“Thou, our King?” cried the birds angrily. “Thou hast compassed it by trick and cunning!” So they made another condition. He should be King who could go down lowest in the ground. How the goose did flap about with its broad breast when it was once more on the land! How quickly the cock scratched a hole! The duck came off the worst of all, for she leapt into a ditch, but sprained her legs, and waddled away to a neighboring pond, crying, “Cheating, cheating!” The little bird without a name, however, sought out a mouse-hole, slipped down into it, and cried out of it with his small voice, “I am King! I am King!”"
"“Thou our King!” cried the birds still more angrily. “Dost thou think thy cunning shall prevail?” They determined to keep him a prisoner in the hole and starve him out. The owl was placed as sentinel in front of it, and was not to let the rascal out if she had any value for her life. When evening was come all the birds were feeling very tired after exerting their wings so much, so they went to bed with their wives and children. The owl alone remained standing by the mouse-hole, gazing steadfastly into it with her great eyes. In the meantime she, too, had grown tired and thought to herself, “You might certainly shut one eye, you will still watch with the other, and the little miscreant shall not come out of his hole.” So she shut one eye, and with the other looked straight at the mouse-hole. The little fellow put his head out and peeped, and wanted to slip away, but the owl came forward immediately, and he drew his head back again. Then the owl opened the one eye again, and shut the other, intending to shut them in turn all through the night."
"But when she next shut the one eye, she forgot to open the other, and as soon as both her eyes were shut she fell asleep. The little fellow soon observed that, and slipped away."
"From that day forth, the owl has never dared to show herself by daylight, for if she does the other birds chase her and pluck her feathers out. She only flies out by night, but hates and pursues mice because they make such ugly holes. The little bird, too, is very unwilling to let himself be seen, because he is afraid it will cost him his life if he is caught. He steals about in the hedges, and when he is quite safe, he sometimes cries, “I am King,” and for this reason, the other birds call him in mockery, ‘King of the hedges’ (Zaunkönig). No one, however, was so happy as the lark at not having to obey the little King. As soon as the sun appears, she ascends high in the air and cries, “Ah, how beautiful that is! beautiful that is! beautiful, beautiful! ah, how beautiful that is!”"
172 The Sole
"The fishes had for a long time been discontented because no order prevailed in their kingdom. None of them turned aside for the others, but all swam to the right or the left as they fancied, or darted between those who wanted to stay together, or got into their way; and a strong one gave a weak one a blow with its tail, which drove it away, or else swallowed it up without more ado. “How delightful it would be,”"
"said they, “if we had a king who enforced law and justice among us!”"
"and they met together to choose for their ruler, the one who could cleave through the water most quickly, and give help to the weak ones."
"They placed themselves in rank and file by the shore, and the pike gave the signal with his tail, on which they all started. Like an arrow, the pike darted away, and with him the herring, the gudgeon, the perch, the carp, and all the rest of them. Even the sole swam with them, and hoped to reach the winning-place. All at once, the cry was heard, “The herring is first!” “Who is first?” screamed angrily the flat envious sole, who had been left far behind, “who is first?” “The herring! The herring,” was the answer. “The naked herring?” cried the jealous creature, “the naked herring?” Since that time the sole’s mouth has been at one side for a punishment."
173 The Bittern and the Hoopoe
"“Where do you like best to feed your flocks?” said a man to an old cow-herd. “Here, sir, where the grass is neither too rich nor too poor, or else it is no use.” “Why not?” asked the man. “Do you hear that melancholy cry from the meadow there?” answered the shepherd, “that is the bittern; he was once a shepherd, and so was the hoopoe also,—I will tell you the story. The bittern pastured his flocks on rich green meadows where flowers grew in abundance, so his cows became wild and unmanageable. The hoopoe drove his cattle on to high barren hills, where the wind plays with the sand, and his cows became thin, and got no strength. When it was evening, and the shepherds wanted to drive their cows homewards, the bittern could not get his together again; they were too high-spirited, and ran away from him. He called, “Come, cows, come,” but it was of no use; they took no notice of his calling."
"The hoopoe, however, could not even get his cows up on their legs, so faint and weak had they become. “Up, up, up,” screamed he, but it was in vain, they remained lying on the sand. That is the way when one has no moderation. And to this day, though they have no flocks now to watch, the bittern cries, “Come, cows, come,” and the hoopoe, “Up, up, up.”"
174 The Owl
"Two or three hundred years ago, when people were far from being so crafty and cunning as they are now-a-day, an extraordinary event took place in a little town. By some mischance one of the great owls, called horned owls, had come from the neighboring woods into the barn of one of the townsfolk in the night-time, and when day broke did not dare to venture forth again from her retreat, for fear of the other birds, which raised a terrible outcry whenever she appeared. In the morning when the man-servant went into the barn to fetch some straw, he was so mightily alarmed at the sight of the owl sitting there in a corner, that he ran away and announced to his master that a monster, the like of which he had never set eyes on in his life, and which could devour a man without the slightest difficulty, was sitting in the barn, rolling its eyes about in its head. “I know you already,” said the master, “you have courage enough to chase a blackbird about the fields, but when you see a dead hen lying, you have to get a stick before you go near it. I must go and see for myself what kind of a monster it is,” added the master, and went quite boldly into the granary and looked round him."
"When, however, he saw the strange grim creature with his own eyes, he was no less terrified than the servant had been. With two bounds he sprang out, ran to his neighbours, and begged them imploringly to lend him assistance against an unknown and dangerous beast, or else the whole town might be in danger if it were to break loose out of the barn, where it was shut up. A great noise and clamour arose in all the streets, the townsmen came armed with spears, hay-forks, scythes, and axes, as if they were going out against an enemy; finally, the senators appeared with the burgomaster at their head. When they had drawn up in the market-place, they marched to the barn, and surrounded it on all sides. Thereupon one of the most courageous of them stepped forth and entered with his spear lowered, but came running out immediately afterwards with a shriek and as pale as death, and could not utter a single word. Yet two others ventured in, but they fared no better. At last one stepped forth; a great strong man who was famous for his warlike deeds, and said, “You will not drive away the monster by merely looking at him; we must be in earnest here, but I see that you have all tuned into women, and not one of you dares to encounter the animal.” He ordered them to give him some armour, had a sword and spear brought, and armed himself. All praised his courage, though many feared for his life. The two barn-doors were opened, and they saw the owl, which in the meantime had perched herself on the middle of a great cross-beam."
"He had a ladder brought, and when he raised it, and made ready to climb up, they all cried out to him that he was to bear himself bravely, and commended him to St. George, who slew the dragon. When he had just got to the top, and the owl perceived that he had designs on her, and was also bewildered by the crowd and the shouting, and knew not how to escape, she rolled her eyes, ruffled her feathers, flapped her wings, snapped her beak, and cried, “Tuwhit, tuwhoo,” in a harsh voice."
"“Strike home! strike home!” screamed the crowd outside to the valiant hero. “Any one who was standing where I am standing,” answered he, “would not cry, strike home!” He certainly did plant his foot one rung higher on the ladder, but then he began to tremble, and half-fainting, went back again."
And now there was no one left who dared to put himself in such danger.
"“The monster,” said they, “has poisoned and mortally wounded the very strongest man among us, by snapping at him and just breathing on him!"
97 The Water of Life
"There was once a King who had an illness, and no one believed that he would come out of it with his life. He had three sons who were much distressed about it, and went down into the palace-garden and wept."
There they met an old man who inquired as to the cause of their grief.
"They told him that their father was so ill that he would most certainly die, for nothing seemed to cure him. Then the old man said, “I know of one more remedy, and that is the water of life; if he drinks of it he will become well again; but it is hard to find.” The eldest said, “I will manage to find it,” and went to the sick King, and begged to be allowed to go forth in search of the water of life, for that alone could save him. “No,” said the King, “the danger of it is too great. I would rather die.” But he begged so long that the King consented. The prince thought in his heart, “If I bring the water, then I shall be best beloved of my father, and shall inherit the kingdom.” So he set out, and when he had ridden forth a little distance, a dwarf stood there in the road who called to him and said, “Whither away so fast?”"
"“Silly shrimp,” said the prince, very haughtily, “it is nothing to do with you,” and rode on. But the little dwarf had grown angry, and had wished an evil wish. Soon after this the prince entered a ravine, and the further he rode the closer the mountains drew together, and at last the road became so narrow that he could not advance a step further; it was impossible either to turn his horse or to dismount from the saddle, and he was shut in there as if in prison. The sick King waited long for him, but he came not. Then the second son said, “Father, let me go forth to seek the water,” and thought to himself, “If my brother is dead, then the kingdom will fall to me.” At first the King would not allow him to go either, but at last he yielded, so the prince set out on the same road that his brother had taken, and he too met the dwarf, who stopped him to ask, whither he was going in such haste? “Little shrimp,” said the prince, “that is nothing to thee,” and rode on without giving him another look. But the dwarf bewitched him, and he, like the other, rode into a ravine, and could neither go forwards nor backwards. So fare haughty people."
"As the second son also remained away, the youngest begged to be allowed to go forth to fetch the water, and at last the King was obliged to let him go. When he met the dwarf and the latter asked him whither he was going in such haste, he stopped, gave him an explanation, and said, “I am seeking the water of life, for my father is sick unto death.” “Dost thou know, then, where that is to be found?” “No,” said the prince. “As thou hast borne thyself as is seemly, and not haughtily like thy false brothers, I will give thee the information and tell thee how thou mayst obtain the water of life. It springs from a fountain in the courtyard of an enchanted castle, but thou wilt not be able to make thy way to it, if I do not give thee an iron wand and two small loaves of bread."
"Strike thrice with the wand on the iron door of the castle and it will spring open: inside lie two lions with gaping jaws, but if thou throwest a loaf to each of them, they will be quieted. Then hasten to fetch some of the water of life before the clock strikes twelve, else the door will shut again, and thou wilt be imprisoned.” The prince thanked him, took the wand and the bread, and set out on his way. When he arrived, everything was as the dwarf had said. The door sprang open at the third stroke of the wand, and when he had appeased the lions with the bread, he entered the castle, and came to a large and splendid hall, wherein sat some enchanted princes whose rings he drew off their fingers. A sword and a loaf of bread were lying there, which he carried away. After this, he entered a chamber, in which was a beautiful maiden who rejoiced when she saw him, kissed him, and told him that he had delivered her, and should have the whole of her kingdom, and that if he would return in a year their wedding should be celebrated; likewise she told him where the spring of the water of life was, and that he was to hasten and draw some of it before the clock struck twelve. Then he went onwards, and at last entered a room where there was a beautiful newly-made bed, and as he was very weary, he felt inclined to rest a little. So he lay down and fell asleep. When he awoke, it was striking a quarter to twelve. He sprang up in a fright, ran to the spring, drew some water in a cup which stood near, and hastened away. But just as he was passing through the iron door, the clock struck twelve, and the door fell to with such violence that it carried away a piece of his heel. He, however, rejoicing at having obtained the water of life, went homewards, and again passed the dwarf. When the latter saw the sword and the loaf, he said, “With these thou hast won great wealth; with the sword thou canst slay whole armies, and the bread will never come to an end.” But the prince would not go home to his father without his brothers, and said, “Dear dwarf, canst thou not tell me where my two brothers are? They went out before I did in search of the water of life, and have not returned.” “They are imprisoned between two mountains,” said the dwarf. “I have condemned them to stay there, because they were so haughty.” Then the prince begged until the dwarf released them; but he warned him, however, and said, “Beware of them, for they have bad hearts.” When his brothers came, he rejoiced, and told them how things had gone with him, that he had found the water of life and had brought a cupful away with him, and had rescued a beautiful princess, who was willing to wait a year for him, and then their wedding was to be celebrated and he would obtain a great kingdom."
"After that they rode on together, and chanced upon a land where war and famine reigned, and the King already thought he must perish, for the scarcity was so great. Then the prince went to him and gave him the loaf, wherewith he fed and satisfied the whole of his kingdom, and then the prince gave him the sword also wherewith he slew the hosts of his enemies, and could now live in rest and peace. The prince then took back his loaf and his sword, and the three brothers rode on. But after this they entered two more countries where war and famine reigned and each time the prince gave his loaf and his sword to the Kings, and had now delivered three kingdoms, and after that they went on board a ship and sailed over the sea. During the passage, the two eldest conversed apart and said, “The youngest has found the water of life and not we, for that our father will give him the kingdom the kingdom which belongs to us, and he will rob us of all our fortune.” They then began to seek revenge, and plotted with each other to destroy him. They waited until they found him fast asleep, then they poured the water of life out of the cup, and took it for themselves, but into the cup they poured salt sea-water. Now therefore, when they arrived home, the youngest took his cup to the sick King in order that he might drink out of it, and be cured. But scarcely had he drunk a very little of the salt sea-water than he became still worse than before. And as he was lamenting over this, the two eldest brothers came, and accused the youngest of having intended to poison him, and said that they had brought him the true water of life, and handed it to him. He had scarcely tasted it, when he felt his sickness departing, and became strong and healthy as in the days of his youth. After that they both went to the youngest, mocked him, and said, “You certainly found the water of life, but you have had the pain, and we the gain; you should have been sharper, and should have kept your eyes open. We took it from you whilst you were asleep at sea, and when a year is over, one of us will go and fetch the beautiful princess. But beware that you do not disclose aught of this to our father; indeed he does not trust you, and if you say a single word, you shall lose your life into the bargain, but if you keep silent, you shall have it as a gift.”"
"The old King was angry with his youngest son, and thought he had plotted against his life. So he summoned the court together and had sentence pronounced upon his son, that he should be secretly shot. And once when the prince was riding forth to the chase, suspecting no evil, the King’s huntsman had to go with him, and when they were quite alone in the forest, the huntsman looked so sorrowful that the prince said to him, “Dear huntsman, what ails you?” The huntsman said, “I cannot tell you, and yet I ought.” Then the prince said, “Say openly what it is, I will pardon you.” “Alas!” said the huntsman, “I am to shoot you dead, the King has ordered me to do it.” Then the prince was shocked, and said, “Dear huntsman, let me live; there, I give you my royal garments; give me your common ones in their stead.” The huntsman said, “I will willingly do that, indeed I should not have been able to shoot you.”"
"Then they exchanged clothes, and the huntsman returned home; the prince, however, went further into the forest. After a time three waggons of gold and precious stones came to the King for his youngest son, which were sent by the three Kings who had slain their enemies with the prince’s sword, and maintained their people with his bread, and who wished to show their gratitude for it. The old King then thought, “Can my son have been innocent?” and said to his people, “Would that he were still alive, how it grieves me that I have suffered him to be killed!” “He still lives,” said the huntsman, “I could not find it in my heart to carry out your command,” and told the King how it had happened. Then a stone fell from the King’s heart, and he had it proclaimed in every country that his son might return and be taken into favour again."
"The princess, however, had a road made up to her palace which was quite bright and golden, and told her people that whosoever came riding straight along it to her, would be the right wooer and was to be admitted, and whoever rode by the side of it, was not the right one, and was not to be admitted. As the time was now close at hand, the eldest thought he would hasten to go to the King’s daughter, and give himself out as her deliverer, and thus win her for his bride, and the kingdom to boot. Therefore he rode forth, and when he arrived in front of the palace, and saw the splendid golden road, he thought, it would be a sin and a shame if he were to ride over that, and turned aside, and rode on the right side of it. But when he came to the door, the servants told him that he was not the right man, and was to go away again. Soon after this the second prince set out, and when he came to the golden road, and his horse had put one foot on it, he thought, it would be a sin and a shame to tread a piece of it off, and he turned aside and rode on the left side of it, and when he reached the door, the attendants told him he was not the right one, and he was to go away again. When at last the year had entirely expired, the third son likewise wished to ride out of the forest to his beloved, and with her forget his sorrows. So he set out and thought of her so incessantly, and wished to be with her so much, that he never noticed the golden road at all. So his horse rode onwards up the middle of it, and when he came to the door, it was opened and the princess received him with joy, and said he was her deliverer, and lord of the kingdom, and their wedding was celebrated with great rejoicing. When it was over she told him that his father invited him to come to him, and had forgiven him."
"So he rode thither, and told him everything; how his brothers had betrayed him, and how he had nevertheless kept silence. The old King wished to punish them, but they had put to sea, and never came back as long as they lived."
98 Doctor Knowall
"There was once on a time a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with two oxen a load of wood to the town, and sold it to a doctor for two thalers. When the money was being counted out to him, it so happened that the doctor was sitting at table, and when the peasant saw how daintily he ate and drank, his heart desired what he saw, and he would willingly have been a doctor too. So he remained standing a while, and at length inquired if he too could not be a doctor. “Oh, yes,” said the doctor, “that is soon managed.” “What must I do?” asked the peasant."
"“In the first place buy thyself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock on the frontispiece: in the second, turn thy cart and thy two oxen into money, and get thyself some clothes, and whatsoever else pertains to medicine; thirdly, have a sign painted for thyself with the words, “I am Doctor Knowall,” and have that nailed up above thy house-door.”"
"The peasant did everything that he had been told to do. When he had doctored people awhile, but not long, a rich and great lord had some money stolen. Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and such a village, and must know what had become of the money. So the lord had the horses put in his carriage, drove out to the village, and asked Crabb if he were Doctor Knowall? Yes, he was, he said. Then he was to go with him and bring back the stolen money. “Oh, yes, but Grethe, my wife, must go too.” The lord was willing and let both of them have a seat in the carriage, and they all drove away together."
"When they came to the nobleman’s castle, the table was spread, and Crabb was told to sit down and eat. “Yes, but my wife, Grethe, too,”"
"said he, and he seated himself with her at the table. And when the first servant came with a dish of delicate fare, the peasant nudged his wife, and said, “Grethe, that was the first,” meaning that was the servant who brought the first dish. The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say, “That is the first thief,” and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said to his comrade outside, “The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he said I was the first.” The second did not want to go in at all, but was forced. So when he went in with his dish, the peasant nudged his wife, and said, “Grethe, that is the second.” This servant was just as much alarmed, and he got out. The third did not fare better, for the peasant again said, “Grethe, that is the third.” The fourth had to carry in a dish that was covered, and the lord told the doctor that he was to show his skill, and guess what was beneath the cover. The doctor looked at the dish, had no idea what to say, and cried, “Ah, poor Crabb.” When the lord heard that, he cried, “There! he knows it, he knows who has the money!”"
"On this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the doctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment. When therefore he went out, all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen the money, and said that they would willingly restore it and give him a heavy sum into the bargain, if he would not denounce them, for if he did they would be hanged. They led him to the spot where the money was concealed. With this the doctor was satisfied, and returned to the hall, sat down to the table, and said, “My lord, now will I search in my book where the gold is hidden.” The fifth servant, however, crept into the stove to hear if the doctor knew still more."
"The Doctor, however, sat still and opened his A B C book, turned the pages backwards and forwards, and looked for the cock. As he could not find it immediately he said, “I know you are there, so you had better show yourself.” Then the fellow in the stove thought that the doctor meant him, and full of terror, sprang out, crying, “That man knows everything!” Then Dr. Knowall showed the count where the money was, but did not say who had stolen it, and received from both sides much money in reward, and became a renowned man."
99 The Spirit in the Bottle
"There was once a poor woodcutter who toiled from early morning till late night. When at last he had laid by some money he said to his boy, “You are my only child, I will spend the money which I have earned with the sweat of my brow on your education; if you learn some honest trade you can support me in my old age, when my limbs have grown stiff and I am obliged to stay at home.” Then the boy went to a High School and learned diligently so that his masters praised him, and he remained there a long time. When he had worked through two classes, but was still not yet perfect in everything, the little pittance which the father had earned was all spent, and the boy was obliged to return home to him. “Ah,” said the father, sorrowfully, “I can give you no more, and in these hard times I cannot earn a farthing more than will suffice for our daily bread.” “Dear father,” answered the son, “don’t trouble yourself about it, if it is God’s will, it will turn to my advantage I shall soon accustom myself to it.” When the father wanted to go into the forest to earn money by helping to pile and stack wood and also chop it, the son said, “I will go with you and help you.” “Nay, my son,” said the father, “that would be hard for you; you are not accustomed to rough work, and will not be able to bear it, besides I have only one axe and no money left wherewith to buy another.” “Just go to the neighbour,” answered the son, “he will lend you his axe until I have earned one for myself.” The father then borrowed an axe of the neighbour, and next morning at break of day they went out into the forest together. The son helped his father and was quite merry and brisk about it. But when the sun was right over their heads, the father said, “We will rest, and have our dinner, and then we shall work as well again.” The son took his bread in his hands, and said, “Just you rest, father, I am not tired; I will walk up and down a little in the forest, and look for birds’ nests.” “Oh, you fool,” said the father, “why should you want to run about there? Afterwards you will be tired, and no longer able to raise your arm; stay here, and sit down beside me.” The son, however, went into the forest, ate his bread, was very merry and peered in among the green branches to see if he could discover a bird’s nest anywhere. So he went up and down to see if he could find a bird’s nest until at last he came to a great dangerous-looking oak, which certainly was already many hundred years old, and which five men could not have spanned. He stood still and looked at it, and thought, “Many a bird must have built its nest in that.” Then all at once it seemed to him that he heard a voice. He listened and became aware that someone was crying in a very smothered voice, “Let me out, let me out!” He looked around, but could discover nothing; nevertheless, he fancied that the voice came out of the ground. Then he cried, “Where art thou?” The voice answered, “I am down here amongst the roots of the oak-tree. Let me out! Let me out!” The scholar began to loosen the earth under the tree, and search among the roots, until at last he found a glass bottle in a little hollow. He lifted it up and held it against the light, and then saw a creature shaped like a frog, springing up and down in it. “Let me out! Let me out!” it cried anew, and the scholar thinking no evil, drew the cork out of the bottle. Immediately a spirit ascended from it, and began to grow, and grew so fast that in a very few moments he stood before the scholar, a terrible fellow as big as half the tree by which he was standing. “Knowest thou,” he cried in an awful voice, “what thy wages are for having let me out?” “No,” replied the scholar fearlessly, “how should I know that?” “Then I will tell thee,” cried the spirit; “I must strangle thee for it.” “Thou shouldst have told me that sooner,” said the scholar, “for I should then have left thee shut up, but my head shall stand fast for all thou canst do; more persons than one must be consulted about that.” “More persons here, more persons there,” said the spirit. “Thou shalt have the wages thou hast earned. Dost thou think that I was shut up there for such a long time as a favour. No, it was a punishment for me. I am the mighty Mercurius. Whoso releases me, him must I strangle.” “Softly,” answered the scholar, “not so fast. I must first know that thou really wert shut up in that little bottle, and that thou art the right spirit. If, indeed, thou canst get in again, I will believe and then thou mayst do as thou wilt with me.” The spirit said haughtily, “that is a very trifling feat,” drew himself together, and made himself as small and slender as he had been at first, so that he crept through the same opening, and right through the neck of the bottle in again. Scarcely was he within than the scholar thrust the cork he had drawn back into the bottle, and threw it among the roots of the oak into its old place, and the spirit was betrayed."
"And now the scolar was about to return to his father, but the spirit cried very piteously, “Ah, do let me out! ah, do let me out!” “No,”"
"answered the scholar, “not a second time! He who has once tried to take my life shall not be set free by me, now that I have caught him again.”"
"“If thou wilt set me free,” said the spirit, “I will give thee so much that thou wilt have plenty all the days of thy life.” “No,” answered the boy, “thou wouldst cheat me as thou didst the first time.” “Thou art playing away with thy own good luck,” said the spirit; “I will do thee no harm but will reward thee richly.” The scholar thought, “I will venture it, perhaps he will keep his word, and anyhow he shall not get the better of me.” Then he took out the cork, and the spirit rose up from the bottle as he had done before, stretched himself out and became as big as a giant. “Now thou shalt have thy reward,” said he, and handed the scholar a little bag just like a plaster, and said, “If thou spreadest one end of this over a wound it will heal, and if thou rubbest steel or iron with the other end it will be changed into silver.” “I must just try that,” said the scholar, and went to a tree, tore off the bark with his axe, and rubbed it with one end of the plaster. It immediately closed together and was healed. “Now, it is all right,” he said to the spirit, “and we can part.” The spirit thanked him for his release, and the boy thanked the spirit for his present, and went back to his father."
"“Where hast thou been racing about?” said the father; “why hast thou forgotten thy work? I said at once that thou wouldst never get on with anything.” “Be easy, father, I will make it up.” “Make it up indeed,”"
"said the father angrily, “there’s no art in that.” “Take care, father, I will soon hew that tree there, so that it will split.” Then he took his plaster, rubbed the axe with it, and dealt a mighty blow, but as the iron had changed into silver, the edge turned; “Hollo, father, just look what a bad axe you’ve given me, it has become quite crooked.” The father was shocked and said, “Ah, what hast thou done? now I shall have to pay for that, and have not the wherewithal, and that is all the good I have got by thy work.” “Don’t get angry,” said the son, “I will soon pay for the axe.” “Oh, thou blockhead,” cried the father, “wherewith wilt thou pay for it? Thou hast nothing but what I give thee. These are students’ tricks that are sticking in thy head, but thou hast no idea of wood-cutting.” After a while the scholar said, “Father, I can really work no more, we had better take a holiday.” “Eh, what!” answered he, “Dost thou think I will sit with my hands lying in my lap like thee? I must go on working, but thou mayst take thyself off home.” “Father, I am here in this wood for the first time, I don’t know my way alone. Do go with me.” As his anger had now abated, the father at last let himself be persuaded and went home with him. Then he said to the son, “Go and sell thy damaged axe, and see what thou canst get for it, and I must earn the difference, in order to pay the neighbour.” The son took the axe, and carried it into town to a goldsmith, who tested it, laid it in the scales, and said, “It is worth four hundred thalers, I have not so much as that by me.” The son said, “Give me what thou hast, I will lend you the rest.” The goldsmith gave him three hundred thalers, and remained a hundred in his debt. The son thereupon went home and said, “Father, I have got the money, go and ask the neighbour what he wants for the axe.” “I know that already,” answered the old man, “one thaler, six groschen.” “Then give him two thalers, twelve groschen, that is double and enough; see, I have money in plenty,” and he gave the father a hundred thalers, and said, “You shall never know want, live as comfortably as you like.” “Good heavens!” said the father, “how hast thou come by these riches?” The scholar then told how all had come to pass, and how he, trusting in his luck, had made such a good hit."
"But with the money that was left, he went back to the High School and went on learning more, and as he could heal all wounds with his plaster, he became the most famous doctor in the whole world."
100 The Devil’s Sooty Brother
"A disbanded soldier had nothing to live on, and did not know how to get on. So he went out into the forest and when he had walked for a short time, he met a little man who was, however, the Devil. The little man said to him, “What ails you, you seem so very sorrowful?” Then the soldier said, “I am hungry, but have no money.” The Devil said, “If you will hire yourself to me, and be my serving-man, you shall have enough for all your life. You shall serve me for seven years, and after that you shall again be free. But one thing I must tell you, and that is, you must not wash, comb, or trim yourself, or cut your hair or nails, or wipe the water from your eyes.” The soldier said, “All right, if there is no help for it,” and went off with the little man, who straightway led him down into hell. Then he told him what he had to do."
"He was to poke the fire under the kettles wherein the hell-broth was stewing, keep the house clean, drive all the sweepings behind the doors, and see that everything was in order, but if he once peeped into the kettles, it would go ill with him. The soldier said, “Good, I will take care.” And then the old Devil went out again on his wanderings, and the soldier entered upon his new duties, made the fire, and swept the dirt well behind the doors, just as he had been bidden. When the old Devil came back again, he looked to see if all had been done, appeared satisfied, and went forth a second time. The soldier now took a good look on every side; the kettles were standing all round hell with a mighty fire below them, and inside they were boiling and sputtering. He would have given anything to look inside them, if the Devil had not so particularly forbidden him: at last, he could no longer restrain himself, slightly raised the lid of the first kettle, and peeped in, and there he saw his former corporal shut in. “Aha, old bird!” said he, “Do I meet you here? You once had me in your power, now I have you,” and he quickly let the lid fall, poked the fire, and added a fresh log. After that, he went to the second kettle, raised its lid also a little, and peeped in; his former ensign was in that. “Aha, old bird, so I find you here! you once had me in your power, now I have you.” He closed the lid again, and fetched yet another log to make it really hot. Then he wanted to see who might be sitting up in the third kettle it was actually be but a general. “Aha, old bird, do I meet you here? Once you had me in your power, now I have you.” And he fetched the bellows and made hell-fire blaze right under him. So he did his work seven years in hell, did not wash, comb, or trim himself, or cut his hair or nails, or wash the water out of his eyes, and the seven years seemed so short to him that he thought he had only been half a year. Now when the time had fully gone by, the Devil came and said, “Well Hans, what have you done?” “I poked the fire under the kettles, and I have swept all the dirt well behind the doors.”"
"“But you have peeped into the kettles as well; it is lucky for you that you added fresh logs to them, or else your life would have been forfeited; now that your time is up, will you go home again?” “Yes,”"

"HER eyes are haunted, eyes that were"
Scarce sad when last we met.
What thing is this has come to her
That she may not forget?
"They loved, they married: it is well!"
"But ah, what memories"
"Are these whereof her eyes half tell,"
Her haunted eyes?
IN BOHEMIA.
"DRAWN blinds and flaring gas within,"
"And wine, and women, and cigars;"
"Without, the city’s heedless din;"
"Above, the white unheeding stars."
But all the London footlights know
The little plaintive smile that stirs
The shadow in those eyes of hers.

The London Sunday faded slow;

Where Perugino’s angels stand

With singing throat and lifted hand?

And the pale piety of eyes
Was as God’s peace upon the world.

"He collected clothes from about the room, packed them into his large"

"the walls he took down the portraits of Betty and one or two trinkets,"

"_King Solomon_ fired a musket at the approaching boat, and called upon his"
"crew to do the same, but Phillips called for quarter and persuaded the"
rest of the crew to lay down their arms and surrender the ship. Phillips
"eagerly joined the pirates and signed the articles, and was ""very forward"
"and brisk"" in helping to rob his own ship of provisions and stores."
"At his trial at Cape Coast Castle, he pleaded, as nearly all the prisoners"
"did, that he was compelled to sign the pirates' articles, which were"

THE CAREER OF DR. WEAVER
_By Mrs. Henry W. Backus_
"_12mo, cloth decorative, illustrated, net $1.25; postpaid $1.40_"
A big and purposeful story interwoven about the responsibilities and
"problems in the medical profession of the present day. Dr. Weaver, a"
"noted specialist, and head of a private hospital, had allowed himself"
"Prefixes (i.e., titles which in speaking come before the name), as"
"_Hon., Mrs., Rev._, etc., should in the heading be placed before"
"the Christian name (as _Smith, Capt. John_), and suffixes as"
"_Jr., D.D., LL.D._, after it (as _Channing, James Ellery, D.D._)."
"Hereditary titles generally follow the Christian name, as _Derby,"
"Thomas Stanley, 1st earl of_; but British courtesy titles (i.e.,"
"those given to the younger sons of dukes and marquesses) precede,"
"as _Wellesley, Lord Charles (2d son of the Duke of Wellington)_. In"
"other languages than English, French, and German the title usually"
"precedes the forename; as, _Alfieri, Conte Vittorio_. Occasionally a"
"French nobleman uniformly places his title before his forenames; as,"
"_Gasparin, Comte Agénor de_."
_Lord_ should be replaced by the exact title in the names of English
"noblemen: e.g., Lord Macaulay should be entered as _Macaulay, 1st"
baron_. _Lord_ in the title of Scotch judges follows the family name;
"as, _Kames, H. Home, afterwards Lord_."
"The title Baronet is given in the form _Scott, Sir Walter, bart._"
"Patronymic phrases, as _of Dedham_, follow all the names; but they must"
immediately follow the family name when they are always used in close
"connection with it, as _Girault de St. Farjeau, Eusèbe_; similarly"
"_aîné_, _fils_, _jeune_, as _Dumas fils, Alexandre_; _Didot fils,"
Ambroise_. Latin appellatives should not in general be separated from
"their nouns by a comma; as, _Caesar Heisterbacensis_."
"The name of a king's wife should be written thus: _Charlotte, Queen,"
"consort of George III of England_. _Anne Boleyn Queen, 2d consort of"
Henry VIII of England._
"""I--I have joined Sir Robert Perry's Ministry,"" he answered."
"""Of course he has, Alicia,"" interposed Lady Eynesford hastily."
"Alicia seated herself on the sofa, remarking as she did so,"
"""Well, you do change a good deal, don't you?"""
"""Really, Miss Derosne,"" he stammered, ""I don't understand you."""
"""Oh, I only mean that you were first with Sir Robert, then with Mr."
"Medland, and now with Sir Robert again! And presently with Mr. Medland"
"again, I suppose?"""
"""She doesn't appreciate the political reasons,"" began Lady Eynesford,"
"with troubled brow and smiling lips; but Coxon, frowning angrily, broke"
"in,"
"""Not the last, I promise you, anyhow, Miss Derosne."""
"""What, you think he's finally beaten then?"""
"""That's not the question. Beaten or not, he is discredited, and no"
"respectable man would act with him."""
"""We needn't discuss--"" began Lady Eynesford again, but this time Alicia"
"was the interrupter. She spoke in a cold, hard way, very unlike her own."
"""If he won, you would all be at his feet."""
Coxon was justified in being angry at her almost savage scorn of him;
"regardless of anything except his wrong, he struck back the sharpest"
"He shook hands with Lovegood and Aubrey; and, turning to Ffolliott, a"
faint smile flickered over his worried face:
"“Ffolliott!... Sorry to be late, but there have been domestic"
difficulties--my butler has gone sick.”
The guests were arriving fast.
“Mistair Maupassant Fosse!” bawled Rippley at the door.
"The little man glared at the servant, fussed into the room, and tripped"
across to his host.
"“A nickname they have for me,” he said--“a nickname....”"
"Rippley watched Blotte solemnly tramp down the stairs, his wig on one"
"side; heard him announce to a lady, just arrived, that he was going to"
sup with the gods; and he was gone.
Groups of guests came swarming up the stairs and passed into the studio.
"Rippley, glancing into the studio, saw the white satin dress of"
Ffolliott move uneasily amongst the arriving guests; and he heard his
"thin, affected drawl as he explained to his host:"
“D’you know--I feel such an ass----”
Pangbutt patted him upon the shoulder:
"“Never mind,” said he absently--“it can’t be helped. Make the best of"
it.”
"would go ashore and through his agents, Messrs. Ross and Co., transmit"
large sums of money to his wife and children in England. But Thwaites had
"another home at Algiers fitted with every luxury, including three Armenian"
girls.
For several years this successful pirate plundered ships of all nations
until such pressure was brought to bear on the Dey of Algiers that
Thwaites thought it best to collect what valuables he could carry away and
disappear.
"Landing at Gibraltar in 1796, dressed in European clothes, he procured a"
"passage to New York in an American frigate, the _Constitution_. Arriving"
"in the United States, he purchased an estate not far from New York and"
"built himself a handsome mansion, but a year later retribution came from"
"an unlooked-for quarter, for he was bitten by a rattlesnake and died in"
the most horrible agonies both of mind and body.
"TOMKINS, JOHN."
Of Gloucestershire.
Hanged at the age of 23 at Rhode Island in 1723. One of Charles Harris's
crew.
"TOPPING, DENNIS."
"He shipped on board the sloop _Buck_ at Providence in 1718, in company"
with Anstis and other famous pirates. Was killed at the taking of a rich
Portuguese ship off the coast of Brazil.
"Sawkins, who never knew what fear meant, stormed the town at the head of"
"his men, but was killed by a musket-ball."
"Basil Ringrose, the buccaneer who wrote the narrative of this voyage,"
"describes Sawkins as being ""a man who was as valiant and courageous as any"
"man could be, and the best beloved of all our company""; and on another"
"occasion he speaks of him as ""a man whom nothing on earth could terrifie."""
"SAWNEY, CAPTAIN."
A pirate of New Providence Island in the Bahamas. In this pirate republic
"this old man lived in the best hut, and was playfully known as ""Governor"
"Sawney."""
"DE SAYAS, FRANCISCO."
"A Spanish pirate hanged at Kingston, Jamaica, in 1823."
"SCOT, LEWIS."
Distinguished as being the first pirate to carry on the trade on land as
well as at sea. Before this time pirates were never known to be anything
"but harmless drunkards when on shore, whatever they might be on board"
their ships. Scot changed all this when he sacked and pillaged the city of
Campeachy. So successful was he that his example was quickly followed by
"Mansfield, John Davis, and other pirates."
"SCOT, ROGER."
"Gunner on board ""Blackbeard's"" ship, the _Queen Ann's Revenge_. Killed on"
"November 22nd, 1718, in North Carolina, during the fight with Lieutenant"
Maynard.
"MULLET, JAMES, _alias_ MILLET."
Of London.
"One of the crew of the _Royal James_, in which vessel Major Stede Bonnet"
played havoc with the shipping along the coasts of South Carolina and New
England. Hanged at Charleston in 1718.
"MULLINS, DARBY."
"This Irish pirate was born in the north of Ireland, not many miles from"
"Londonderry. Being left an orphan at the age of 18, he was sold to a"
planter in the West Indies for a term of four years.
"After the great earthquake at Jamaica in 1691, Mullins built himself a"
house at Kingston and ran it as a punch-house--often a very profitable
business when the buccaneers returned to Port Royal with good plunder.
"This business failing, he went to New York, where he met Captain Kidd, and"
"was, according to his own story, persuaded to engage in piracy, it being"
"urged that the robbing only of infidels, the enemies of Christianity, was"
"an act, not only lawful, but one highly meritorious."
At his trial later on in London his judges did not agree with this view of
"the rights of property, and Mullins was hanged at Execution Dock on May"
"23rd, 1701."

_A Terrifying Tale Of Horror In The Skies_
THE FLYING EYES
By J. Hunter Holly
Author of ENCOUNTER and THE GREEN PLANET
Linc Hosler was sitting in a packed football stadium when the Flying
Eyes appeared and cast their hypnotic power over half the crowd.
Thousands of people suddenly began marching zombie-like into the woods
where they vanished into a black pit.
Linc used every resource of the Space Research Lab and the National
"Guard to destroy the Eyes. But nothing could stop them, for they proved"
immune to bullets and bombs.
"In desperation, Linc captured an Eye and found a way to communicate with"
it through his mind. He learned that radiation was fuel for the
creatures' lives. And then they issued their terrible ultimatum: Explode
a series of atom bombs to supply them with radiation or they would turn
the world's population into mindless robots.
It gave the world two harrowing choices--self-destruction via fallout
from the bombs or annihilation via the sinister Flying Eyes....

He made his way down through an ascending stream of newly-arrived
"guests, with some difficulty, just as Ffolliott, seeing Sir Tankerton"
"Wollup hesitate at the door, went up to the great man mincingly, and"
said affectedly:
"“Oh, I say, Sir Tankerton--d’you know, I feel such an awful ass--but"
they told me it was a fancy-dress affair.”
"Sir Tankerton, staring with bloodshot eyes of ruffled dignity at the"
"thing before him, sniffed."
“Go away!” he said testily.
Ffolliott went away.
"As the pompous millionaire stood irresolute at the doorway, an"
"absent-minded snuffy little old gentleman shuffled up to his elbow,"
followed at a couple of paces by a little faded old lady of withered
"prehistoric design, and, touching him on the sleeve inquiringly, said:"
"“My good man--before you announce our names, will you tell me which is"
the host? I have never seen my host before--in fact----”
"“Poof--poof!” squealed Sir Tankerton Wollup, and strutted into the room."
“Dear me!” The little old gentleman turned to his little old lady; and
added in a confidential undertone:

"have always heard, my dear, that Bohemia was a strange country.... In"
"fact, Charlotte, it’s _rather_ thrilling, is it not?”"
to drift away from the standards of his youth in his desire for wealth
and social and scientific prestige. When an exposé of the methods
employed by him in furthering his schemes for the glorifying of the
"name of ""Weaver"" in the medical world is threatened, it is frustrated"

"I answered, ""All right,"" then went cautiously across deck and crept down"

passed in and closed the door. Somehow my fingers could not locate the
"light jet, but what matter? In three minutes I had undressed and was"
fast asleep.
CHAPTER IV
NIRVANA
"A pleasant sense of motion came over me that suggested cradling waves,"
and I was sleepily wondering why we had gone out on a day that portended
"storms, when a tapping at my stateroom door was followed by someone"
whispering:
"""Aren't you ever going to get up, you lazy old dear?"""
It was a girl's voice.
"Gradually and cautiously I drew the sheet about my chin, feeling no"
little confused to have a girl five feet away whispering pet names at me
through a thin partition.
Simonetta gave her mother what was indispensable for household expenses
and managed the rest herself.
Kennedy retailed this information the first day they went to Giovanni
"Battista Lanza’s house. Cæsar could see Simonetta keeping the books,"
"while the small brother, in a white blouse that came to his heels, was"
"chasing a dog, holding a pipe in his hand by the thick part, as if it"
"were a pistol, the dog barking and hanging on to the blouse, the small"
"boy shrieking and laughing, when Signora Vittoria came bawling out."
"Kennedy presented Simonetta to his friend Cæsar, and she smiled and"
gave her hand.
“Is Signore Giovanni Battista here?” Kennedy asked Signora Vittoria.
"“Yes, he is in the court.” she answered in her gloomy way."
“Is something wrong with your mamma?” said Kennedy to Simonetta.
“Nothing.”
"They went into the court and Giovanni Battista arose, very dignified,"
and bowed to Cæsar. The elder son and the two workmen in white blouses
"and paper caps were busy with water and wires, cleaning a plaster mould"
they had just emptied.
The mould was a big has-relief of the Way of the Cross. Giovanni
Battista permitted himself various jocose remarks about the Way of
"the Cross, which his son and the other two workmen heard with"
great indifference; but while he was still emptying his store of
"anti-Christian irony, the voice of Signora Vittoria was heard, crying"
"power without bounds, and _of which there exists no other example_, he"
"announced publicly, that, if he had committed any act of injustice,"
he was ready to make reparation. All were silent.... He died; and the
enthusiasm which he communicated to his people will be seen to change
the face of three-quarters of the globe.... I shall add that the
"religion of Mohammed is the most simple in its dogmas, the least"
"absurd in its practices, above all others tolerant in its"
"principles.""--_Condorcet_."

This rule has many exceptions. Some Oriental writers are known and

“Eh?” bawled Sir Gilders Persimmon.
All eyes turned from Ffolliott to the perspiring Fosse. The little man
shifted uneasily under the fire of many amused critical eyes.
"“I was saying,” shrilled the minor critic in his thin jerky voice,"
“that the man who does not play whist is laying up a sad old age for
himself.”
The old baronet shook his head:
“The man who what?”
Fosse licked his lips sullenly:
"“The man who doesn’t play whist,” shrieked Fosse, reddening miserably."
“What about him?” asked Sir Gilders peremptorily.
"“Lays up a sad old age for himself,” screamed the miserable little man."
The old gentleman knit his brows:
“A reformed rake?” he asked testily....
But attention was diverted from the fussy little minor critic’s despair
by the murmur of admiration which greeted the entrance into the room
of a beautiful woman to whom Quogge Myre was paying aggressively
marked court as the announcement of her name called the regard of
the assembled guests to her arrival. Myre was ever for stealing the
lime-light. He was a born filcher of honour. But the beauty’s calm

The Further Adventures of Peggy of Spinster Farm
_By Helen M. Winslow_
"_12mo, cloth decorative, illustrated, net $1.25; postpaid $ 1.40_"
Miss Winslow calls us again away from the strenuous and noisy
"confusion of modern cities to the charm and contentment of life ""under"
"the greenwood tree."" Peggy's adventures had only just begun in the"
"first book. In this new record of life at Spinster Farm and ""Elysium,"""
"""At the Sign of the Town Pump,"" there is plenty of romantic adventure"
of the kind that proves truth to be stranger sometimes than fiction.
"There is humor, too, in even greater quantities than in the preceding"
"book, sparkling humor that places the author well up in the list of"
"our New England humorists. ""At the Sign of the Town Pump"" will be"
welcomed not only by those who enjoyed making the acquaintance of
"Spinster Farm, but by thousands of new readers who appreciate a clever"
story and a fascinating heroine.
"_On ""Peggy at Spinster Farm"" the Press opinions are as follows_:"
"""Very alluring are the pictures she draws of the old-fashioned"
"house, the splendid old trees, the pleasant walks, the gorgeous"
"sunsets, and--or it would not be Helen Winslow--the"

irritate me; they seem to me like old ladies with a flatulency that
prevents their breathing freely.”
Kennedy laughed at the definition.
_CHIC AND THE REVOLUTION_
“I understand hating bad kings and conquerors; but artists! What harm do
they do?” said Laura.
“Artists are always doing harm to the whole of humanity. They have
"invented an esthetic system for the use of the rich, and they have"
killed the Revolution. The _chic_ put an end to the Revolution. And
"now everything is coming back; enthusiasm for the aristocracy, for the"
Church; the cult of kings. People look backward and the Revolutionary
movement is paralysed. The people that irritate me most are those
"esthetes of the Ruskin school, for whom everything is religious: having"
"money, buying jewels, blowing one’s nose... everything is religious."
"Vulgar creatures, lackeys that they are!”"
"“My brother is a demagogue,” said Laura ironically."
"“Yes,” added Kennedy; “he doesn’t like categories.”"
“But each thing has its value whether he likes it or not.”
"“I do not deny different values, or even categories. There are things of"
"great value in life; some natural, like youth, beauty, strength;"
"others more artificial, like money, social position; but this idea of"
"distinction, of aristocratic fineness, is a farce. It is a literary"
hysteric desire to talk loudly and hide his chagrin; and he turned at
"the sound of Fosse’s voice, raised in argument, as hyena goes to offal."
"Fosse in his despair had turned from Sir Gilders, and launched into the"
discussion round about him:
"“In the arts,” he was saying, “woman does not, cannot, shine. She only"
exists--on sufferance. A woman’s province----”
Myre had strolled towards the voice:
"“I am flattered to find,” said he, “that Mr. Fosse has been reading me."
He is right. A woman’s province is to be beautiful; and if she write
at all she may write of the nursery--of the domesticities. A woman
has not the experiences of life--she writes only from intuition. She
cannot experience the emotions of a man--cannot describe all shades of
life--is too careful of her skirts to have been on the heights and in
the gutters----”
Lovegood coughed:
"“Never,” said he, with big deliberate voice--“never shall I again"
approach a municipal sewer without an ecstatic thrill.”
Quogge Myre took no notice of the shaft:
"“A woman,” said he, “cannot be in the thrash and fume of life. She only"
peeps out fearfully over the window-blind at the doings of the world.
She has not physical strength----”
Somebody coughed:
“Tra-la-lee!” said he--“opera--bouffe--bouffe--bouffe.”
CHAPTER XIV
"""SALLIE HARRIS"""
Sallie's first startled impulse was to deny the new identity Slyne had
so glibly bestowed on her. It seemed too preposterous to be believable;
"and she was very suspicious of him. A little flushed, more than a little"
"afraid, and yet in some sense convinced in spite of herself by the"
outward and visible signs about her that all these strange happenings
"must have at least some foundation of fact, she sought to read the"
others' thoughts in their faces.
"The Marquis of Ingoldsby was gaping at her, in open wonder and"
"admiration. Slyne's features wore a subdued expression of triumph, and"
"Captain Dove's a dazed, incredulous frown. Mr. Jobling was beaming about"
"him, so apparently satisfied with her, so respectably prosperous-looking"
himself that her doubts as to Slyne's good faith began to give way. When
the lawyer was in turn presented to her and also addressed her by that
"new name, she could scarcely disclaim it."
"""You'll stay and have luncheon with us, Lord Ingoldsby?"" Slyne remarked,"
touching the bell; and his lordship left off gaping at Sallie to look
him over with all the solemn sagacity of a young owl in broad daylight.
"""Er--all right,"" his lordship at length agreed. ""Don't mind if I do."
"""Though I have some--er--friends waitin' for me,"" he added as an"
type of singing.
Since the standard of music and words in the Gospel Songs is
considerably below that which prevails in our best hymnals as well as in
"secular music and literature taught in the public schools, churches"
should seriously consider the ultimate effect of their too frequent use.
It is a fallacy to assert that the people will respond to nothing
"better. Gospel Songs have a legitimate place, particularly in special"
"services and revivals, but they leave much to be desired in the total"
work and worship of the church. Neither the music nor the words possess
the strength and dignity entirely adequate for the worshipful praise of
the Eternal.
The principal names associated with Gospel Songs are the following:
"_Authors._ Fanny J. Crosby, Philip P. Bliss, Robert Lowry, Katherine"
"Hankey, E. A. Hoffman, and many others. Most of the words, though not"
"all, were written by Americans during the latter part of the nineteenth"
century. Miss Crosby was by far the most prolific of them all and many
of her works are found in all modern hymnals of denominations that use
"this type of music. In Germany, Ernst Gebhardt became the leader of the"
"gospel song movement, composing words and music, publishing numerous"
"song books, and serving as song leader in great revival meetings."
"_Music._ William B. Bradbury, Robert Lowry, W. H. Doane, Philip Philips,"
"James McGranahan, George C. Stebbins, P. P. Bliss, D. W. Towner, Wm. J."
"Kirkpatrick, and others."
"_Song Leaders._ P. P. Bliss, Ira Sankey, James McGranahan, George C."
"Stebbins, Charles Alexander, Homer Rodeheaver."
It should be noted that there is no absolute line of demarcation between
at once.
"With this urgency in mind, I suggested to Frances and Betty that I"
"cross to Calais alone, regardless of the weather, leaving them at Dover"
"till my return. But they would not be left behind, so we all set sail on"
a blustery morning and paid for our temerity with a day of suffering. In
"Calais we posted our letters, having learned that a messenger would leave"
"that same day for Paris, and two days later we returned to Dover."
"Our journey home was made in the rain, Bettina sleeping with her head on"
my shoulder a great part of the way. And I enjoyed the rain even more
than I had enjoyed the sunshine.
"We reached London nearly a week before the king's return, so that nothing"
was known of our journey at court.
CHAPTER XI
"""ALL SUNSHINE MAKES THE DESERT"""
"Whatever faults Whitehall may have had as a place of residence, dulness"
"was not among them. There were balls, games with high stakes, theatres,"
"gossip, scandals, and once in a long while an affair of state to interest"
"us. In order to interest the court thoroughly, an affair of state must"
"have involved the getting of money for the privy purse; that is, for the"
"king's personal use, for out of it the courtesans were fed and gambling"
debts were paid.
"Mr. Coxon may be forgiven for being, on this same important Monday, in a"
state of some nervous excitement. He had a severe attack of what are
"vulgarly called ""the fidgets,"" and Sir John, who was spending the"
"morning at the Club (for his court was not sitting), glanced at him over"
his eye-glasses with an irritated look. The ex-Attorney-General would
"not sit still, but flitted continually from window to table, and back"
"from table to window, taking up and putting down journal after journal."
"Much depended, in Mr. Coxon's view, on the event of that day, for Sir"
"John spoke openly of his approaching retirement, and an appointment"
sometimes thought worthy of a Premier's acceptance might be in Coxon's
"grasp before many weeks were past, if only Medland and his noxious idea"
of getting a first-class man out from England could be swept together
into limbo.
"""What's the betting about to-night?"" asked the Chief Justice, as in one"
of his restless turns the brooding politician passed near.
"""We reckon to beat him by five,"" answered Coxon."
"""Unless any of your men turn tail, that is? I hear Fenton's very"
wobbly--says he daren't show his face in the North-east Ward if he
"throws Medland over."""
"""Oh, he's all right."""
"""Been promised something?"""
"""You might allow some of us to have consciences, Chief Justice,"" said"
"Coxon, with an attempt at geniality."
"""Oh, some of you, yes. But I'll pick my men, please,"" remarked Sir John,"
"with a pleasant smile. ""Perry's got a conscience, and Kilshaw--well,"
"Monsieur considered this a great joke, exclaiming:"
"""It is not so much as that! She is but three--to me, always three! Yet,"
"as you say, I might better find her with you than anywhere! A despairing"
"search, my boys!"""
Tommy's eyes were twinkling as he murmured sympathetically:
"""If it's a three-year-old you want, there's a place in Havana called"
"'Casa de Beneficencia Maternidad,' where furtive-eyed damsels leave"
"kiddies at twilight, ring the doorbell, and beat it. You might pick up"
"one there, as a last resort."""
"""But--but,"" Monsieur began to sputter, when I threw an orange at Tommy,"
"explaining to our agitated guest that he was a cut-up devoid of ideas,"
really an intellectual outcast.
"""Well,"" he cried, seeming to exude pleasure, ""I will stay with you a"
"while, eh? Maybe we can teach him something--this cut-upping Tommy of"
"yours!"""
"He had fallen in with our scheme most agreeably, and later Tommy"
confided to me that he was glad we wouldn't have to sit on the old
fellow's head.
"Passing that afternoon beneath Morro Castle, the _Whim_ tacked prettily"
through the entrance of Havana harbor and in another scant two miles
dropped anchor.
"Havana Bay is a dancing sheet of water, as bright as the skies and"
hardly less contagious than the city's laughter. But when one drops
"A sigh escaped her, and her hand sought my arm."
"""I was young once, m'sieur,"" she said in that calm, refined voice which"
had long ago always sounded so much to me like that of my own dead
"mother.  ""I understand your feeling--I understand perfectly.  It is only"
my poor daughter who does not understand.  She knows that you have
"forsaken her--that is all."""
It was upon my tongue to lay bare to her the secret of my heart's
"longings, yet I hesitated.  I remembered that calm, serious, sweet-faced"
"woman on the other side of the English Channel, far from the glare and"
glitter of life as I knew it--the fevered life which the diplomat in
"Paris is forced to lead.  I remembered my troth to Edith, and my"
conscience pricked me.
"""Could it be possible,"" I reflected, ""that Yolande was really in the pay"
"of a Government hostile to England?""  Kaye was already nearing Berlin"
with the intention of searching out her actions and exposing her as a
"spy, while Anderson had already denounced her as having been a party to"
an attempt to secure the secret which he had carried from Berlin to
Downing Street.
With a mother's solicitude the Countess could for some time only speak
"of Yolande's mysterious attack; but at last, in order to prosecute my"
"inquiries further, I observed, during a lull in the conversation:"
"""At the Baroness de Chalencon's last night a friend of yours inquired"
"about you, madame."""
"""A friend?  Who?"""
I flattered myself that we had all done a neat bit of convincing lying in
a good cause.
"""Odds fish!"" mumbled the king, pulling his chin beard, evidently puzzled."
"""Odds fish!"" exclaimed Frances, mimicking the king's tone of voice and"
"twisting an imaginary beard. ""Some one has been hoaxing Jacob Hall's"
"friend."""
"It was a bold speech, but Frances carried it off splendidly by turning to"
the king and speaking in mock seriousness:--
"""Your Majesty should put a check on Rochester and the wags. It is a shame"
to permit them to work upon the credulity of one who is growing weak in
"mind by reason of age."""
"The country girl had vanquished the terror of the court, and all who had"
"witnessed the battle rejoiced; that is, all save the king and Castlemain."
"She glared at Frances, and her face, usually beautiful despite the lack"
"of youth, became hideous with rage. She was making ready for another"
"attack of words, if not of finger nails, when the duchess interposed,"
saying:--
"""Evidently some one has been hoaxing you, Lady Castlemain. Mistress"
Jennings was not kidnapped Sunday nor any other day. She has been with
"me constantly of late, excepting Sunday after four o'clock, and she has"
"accounted for herself from that time till her return to my closet."""
"Castlemain was whipped out, so she turned the whole matter off with a"
"forced laugh, saying:--"
"from the mill-house, the fate of which must have afforded a striking"
object-lesson to a costive magistracy in trouble about a forced loan.
"""We are undone,"" he cried; ""I am a married man, your Excellency, and"
have not a _maravedi_ to call my own. You had better shoot me out of
"hand, and be done with it. Indeed, we cannot possibly pay."""
"""Go and find your father,"" cried Cabrera; ""he pocketed half of the price"
of Don Ramon Garcia's house. I cannot see my namesake suffer. Tell him
that two thousand _duros_ is the price up till noon. After that it will
"have risen to four thousand, and by three of the afternoon, if the money"
be not paid into the treasury of the only absolute and Catholic
"sovereign (in the present instance my breeches pocket), I shall be"
reluctantly compelled to shoot one dozen of the leading citizens of the
township of Sarria. Let a strong guard accompany this young man till he
"returns from carrying his message."""
"In this way did Cabrera replenish the treasury of his master Don Carlos,"
and with such pleasant argument did he induce reluctant _alcaldes_ to
discover the whereabouts of their strong boxes.
"For a remarkably shrewd man was General Ramon Cabrera, the butcher of"
Tortosa.
CHAPTER XXIV
HOW TO BECOME A SOLDIER
must pay me one of her garters as her admission fee to this inn. If she
"be madam, she enters free. It is a privilege conferred on the Maid's"
"Garter by good St. Augustine when he was Bishop of Canterbury, so long"
"ago that the memory of man runneth not to the contrary."""
"""What nonsense is this?"" asked Frances, turning to me, and Bettina asked"
"the same question with her eyes. I explained the matter, and Frances,"
"turning to the porter, said:--"
"""I'll buy you off with a jacobus or a guinea."""
"""Not a hundred guineas would buy me off, my lady,"" answered the porter,"
"bowing, ""though I might say that a shilling usually goes with the"
"garter."""
"""Well, I'll send you both the shilling and the garter from my room,"" said"
"Frances, moving toward the inn door."
"""The garter must be paid here, my lady. The shilling may be paid at any"
"time,"" returned the porter, with polite insistence."
"Frances was about to protest, but Betty, more in sympathy with the"
"eccentric customs of inns, modestly lifted her skirts, untied her garter"
"and offered it to the porter, telling him very seriously:--"
"""I am a maid."""
"The porter thanked her gravely, whereupon Frances, turning her back on"
"the audience in the doorway, brought forth her garter, gave it to the"
"porter, and we were admitted."
"Our supper, beds, and breakfast were all so good that they reconciled"
"returned to their owners. To prevent Searle's doing such things again, he"
"was deprived of his ship's rudder and sails. In 1666, Searle, in company"
"with a Captain Stedman and a party of only eighty men, took the Island of"
"Tobago, near Trinidad, from the Dutch, destroying everything they could"
not carry away.
"SELKIRK, ALEXANDER. The original Robinson Crusoe."
"Born in 1676 at Largo in Fifeshire, he was the seventh son of John"
"Selcraig, a shoemaker. In 1695 he was cited to appear before the Session"
"for ""indecent conduct in church,"" but ran away to sea. In 1701 he was back"
"again in Largo, and was rebuked in the face of the congregation for"
"quarrelling with his brothers. A year later Selkirk sailed to England, and"
in 1703 joined Dampier's expedition to the South Seas. Appointed
"sailing-master to the _Cinque Ports_, commanded by Captain Stradling."
"In September, 1704, he arrived at the uninhabited island of Juan"
"Fernandez, in the South Pacific. Selkirk, having quarrelled with the"
"captain, insisted on being landed on the island with all his belongings."
"He lived alone here for nearly four years, building himself two cabins,"
"hunting the goats which abounded, and taming young goats and cats to be"
his companions.
"On the night of January 31st, 1709, seeing two ships, Selkirk lit a fire,"
and a boat was sent ashore. These ships were the _Duke_ and _Duchess_ of
"Bristol, under the command of Captain Woodes Rogers, while his old friend"
Dampier was acting as pilot. Selkirk was at once appointed sailing-master
"of the _Duchess_, and eventually arrived back in the Thames on October"
"14th, 1711, with booty worth £800, having been away from England for eight"
"years. While in England he met Steele, who described Selkirk as a ""man of"
"good sense, with strong but cheerful expression."" Whether Selkirk ever met"
Carolina.
"RINGROSE, BASIL. Buccaneer, pirate, and author."
Sailed in 1679 to the West Indies. A year later Ringrose had joined the
"buccaneers at their rendezvous in the Gulf of Darien, where they were"
preparing for a bold enterprise on the Spanish Main. They landed and
"marched to the town of Santa Maria, which they plundered and burnt."
Thence they travelled in canoes down the river to the Bay of Panama. After
"attacking the Spanish fleet and laying siege to the city, the buccaneers"
"cruised up and down the West Coast of South America for eighteen months,"
sacking towns and attacking Spanish ships. All this while Ringrose kept a
"very full and graphic journal, in which he recorded not only their"
"exploits, but also their hardships and quarrels, and gave descriptions as"
"well of the various natives and their customs, and drew charts and"
sketches.
"In 1681 Ringrose was still with Captain Sharp, and sailed through the"
"Straits of Magellan, and on January 30th of the same year anchored off"
"Antigua. Here he got a passage in a ship to England, landing safely at"
Dartmouth on March 26th.
"A year later he published an account of his voyage, as a second volume to"
"Esquemeling's, ""Bucaniers of America."" In 1684 he went to sea again in the"
"_Cygnet_ (Captain Swan), to traffic with the Spanish colonies. But the"
"Spaniards refused to trade with them. In October, 1684, they met the"
"famous Captain Edward Davis at that favourite haunt of the buccaneers, the"
Isle of Plate. The two captains agreed to join forces and to go together
"""on the account,"" so all the cargo was thrown overboard the _Cygnet_, and"
the ships set out to make war on any Spanish ships they might meet with.
"The Girl felt the colour leave her cheeks, though she made a gesture for"
him to proceed.
"""Pedro not 'ere any longer,"" smiled the Mexican. ""Me senda 'im to the"
"devil. Serva 'im right."""
"""An' the woman?"" gasped the Girl."
"""She gone--got away--Monterey by this time,"" replied Castro with evident"
"disappointment. ""But Meester Ashby 'e know too much--'ees men everywhere"
"searched the camp--no safa 'ere now. To-norrow--"" Castro stopped short;"
the next instant with a joyful gleam in his eyes he cried out:
"""_Maestro_!"""
"""Castro's right, Girl,"" said Johnson, who had waked and heard the"
"Mexican's last words; ""it is not safe a moment more here, and I must"
"go."""
With a little cry of loving protest the Girl abruptly left the men to
"talk over the situation and sought the opposite side of the room. There,"
her eyes half-closed and her lips pressed tightly together she gave
herself up to her distressing fears. After a while it was made plain to
"her that she was being brought into the conversation, for every now and"
"then Castro would look curiously at her; at length, as if it had been"
"determined by them that nothing should be undertaken without her advice,"
"Johnson, followed by his subordinate, came over to her and related in"
detail all the startling information that Castro had brought.
"Quietly the Girl listened and, in the end, it was agreed between them"
"that it would be safer for the men not to leave the cabin together, but"
that Castro should go at once with the understanding that he should
procure horses and wait for the master at a given point across the
"""I will undertake that no one of them hath ever been further South than"
"this village of Sarria,"" said Concha, somewhat hastily, and without"
sufficient authority.
Cabrera looked at the papers. There was a Carlist commission in the name
"of Don Rollo Blair duly made out, a letter from General Elio, chief of"
"the staff, commending all the four by name and description to all good"
"servants of Don Carlos, as trustworthy persons engaged on a dangerous"
"and secret mission. Most of all, however, he seemed to be impressed with"
"the ring belonging to Etienne, with its revolving gem and concealed"
portrait of Carlos the Fifth.
"He placed it on his finger and gazing intently, asked to whom it"
"belonged. As soon as he understood, he summoned the little Frenchman to"
"his presence. Etienne came at the word, calm as usual, and twirling his"
moustache in the manner of Rollo.
"""This is your ring?"" he demanded of the prisoner. Concha tried to catch"
Etienne's eye to signal to him that he must give Cabrera that upon which
his fancy had lighted. But her former lover stubbornly avoided her eye.
"""That is my ring,"" he answered dryly, after a cursory inspection of the"
article in question as it lay in the palm of the _guerillero's_ hand.
"""It is very precious to you?"" asked the butcher of Tortosa,"
suggestively.
"""It was given to me by my cousin, the king,"" answered Etienne, briefly."
"""Then I presume you do not care to part with it?"" said Cabrera, turning"
"it about on his finger, and holding it this way and that to the light."
Laura found herself besieged by the Englishman; she couldn’t decide to
"discourage him entirely, and at critical moments she would take the"
"train, go off to Naples, and come back two or three days later,"
doubtless with more strength for withstanding the siege.
"“As a matter of reciprocal justice, since he makes love to my sister,"
"I ought to make love to his wife,” thought Cæsar, and he went several"
times to the Hotel Excelsior to call on Susanna.
The Yankee wife was full of complaints against her husband. Her father
"had advised her simply to get a divorce, but she didn’t want to."
"She found such a solution lacking in distinction, and no doubt she"
"considered the advice of an author in her own country very true, who had"
given this triple injunction to the students of a woman’s college: “Do
"not drink, that is, do not drink too much; do not smoke, that is, do not"
"smoke too much; and do not get married, that is, do not get married too"
much.”
It did not seem quite right to Susanna to get married too much. Besides
she had a desire to become a Catholic. One day she questioned Cæsar
about it:
"“You want to change your religion!” exclaimed Cæsar, “What for? I don’t"
believe you are going to find your lost faith by becoming a Catholic.”
"“And what do you think about it, Kennedy?” Susanna asked the young"
"Englishman, who was there too."
“To me a Catholic woman seems doubly enchanting.”
“You would not marry a woman who wasn’t a Catholic?”
"Lynn Moulton made no fight and Kennedy did not pursue the case, for,"
"with the rescue of Antoinette Moulton, his interest ceased."
"Blackmail takes various forms, and the Moulton affair was only one"
phase of it. It was not long before we had to meet a much stranger
attempt.
"“Read the letter, Professor Kennedy. Then I will tell you the sequel.”"
Mrs. Hunter Blake lay back in the cushions of her invalid chair in the
"sun parlor of the great Blake mansion on Riverside Drive, facing the"
Hudson with its continuous reel of maritime life framed against the
green-hilled background of the Jersey shore.
"Her nurse, Miss Dora Sears, gently smoothed out the pillows and"
adjusted them so that the invalid could more easily watch us. Mrs.
"Blake, wealthy, known as a philanthropist, was not an old woman, but"
had been for years a great sufferer from rheumatism.
"I watched Miss Sears eagerly. Full-bosomed, fine of face and figure,"
she was something more than a nurse; she was a companion. She had
"bright, sparkling black eyes and an expression about her well-cut mouth"
which made one want to laugh with her. It seemed to say that the world
was a huge joke and she invited you to enjoy the joke with her.
"Kennedy took the letter which Miss Sears proffered him, and as he did"
"so I could not help noticing her full, plump forearm on which gleamed a"
handsome plain gold bracelet. He spread the letter out on a dainty
wicker table in such a way that we both could see it.
Kuvalda in such cases came to their assistance with his philosophy.
"""Don't lose your temper, brothers, everything has an end, this is the"
"chief characteristic of life.  The winter will pass, summer will follow"
"... a glorious time, when the very sparrows are filled with rejoicing."""
But his speeches did not have any effect--a mouthful of even the
freshest and purest water will not satisfy a hungry man.
Deacon Taras also tried to amuse the people by singing his songs and
"relating his tales.  He was more successful, and sometimes his"
endeavours ended in a wild and glorious orgy at the eating-house.  They
"sang, laughed and danced, and for hours behaved like madmen.  After"
"this they again fell into a despairing mood, sitting at the tables of"
"the eating-house, in the black smoke of the lamp and the tobacco; sad"
"and tattered, speaking lazily to each other, listening to the wild"
"howling of the wind, and thinking how they could get enough vodki to"
deaden their senses.
"And their hand was against every man, and every man's hand against them."
PART II.
"All things are relative in this world, and a man cannot sink into any"
"condition so bad that it could not be worse. One day, towards the end"
"of September, Captain Aristid Kuvalda was sitting, as was his custom,"
"on the bench near the door of the dosshouse, looking at the stone"
building built by the merchant Petunikoff close to Vaviloff's
"eatinghouse, and thinking deeply.  This building, which was partly"
"surrounded by woods, served the purpose of a candle factory."
within his lines.
"But at the sight of little Concha, her dark eyes full of light, her"
"hands clapping together in innocent delight, her white teeth disclosed"
"in gay and dainty laughter, a certain _maja_ note of daring unconvention"
"in her costume, she was so exactly all that would have sent him into"
"raptures twenty years before when he was an apprentice in Tortosa, that"
the grim man only smiled and turned again to the unwilling spokesman of
the municipality of Sarria.
A voice from the press before the burning house announced the delegate's
quality.
"""Don Raphael de Flores, son of our _alcalde_."""
"""Speak on, Don Raphael,"" cried Cabrera; ""I will not shoot you unless it"
"should be necessary."""
Thus encouraged the trembling youth began.
"""Your Excellency,"" he quavered, ""we of Sarria have nothing to do with"
the family of Fernandez. We would not give any one of them a handful of
maize or a plate of lentil broth if he were starving. We are loyal men
and women--well-wishers to the cause of the only true and absolute King
"Carlos Quinto."""
"""I am credibly informed that it is otherwise,"" said Cabrera, ""and that"
you are a den of red-hot nationals. I therefore impose a fine of two
"thousand _duros_ on the municipality, and as you are the alcalde's son,"
"we will keep you in durance till they be paid."""
Don Raphael fell on his knees. His pale face was reddened by the flames
detectives watching all over the city and country for any car that
looks suspicious.”
"Kennedy thanked him for his courtesy, and we rose to go. “I shall be"
"glad to keep you informed of anything that turns up,” he promised."
CHAPTER XX
THE ARTIFICIAL KIDNEY
"In the laboratory, Kennedy quietly set to work. He began by tearing"
from the germ letter the piece of gelatine and first examining it with
"a pocket lens. Then, with a sterile platinum wire, he picked out"
several minute sections of the black spot on the gelatine and placed
"them in agar, blood serum, and other media on which they would be"
likely to grow.
"“I shall have to wait until to-morrow to examine them properly,” he"
"remarked. “There are colonies of something there, all right, but I must"
have them more fully developed.”
"WHAT to read. This is like giving a loaded gun to a boy and saying,"
"'Shoot away! ... No matter in which direction you point your aim, . ."
"shoot yourself if you like, and others too,--anyhow, you've GOT the"
gun!' Of course there are a few fellows who have occasionally drawn up
"a list of books as suitable for everybody's perusal,--but then these"
"lists cannot be taken as true criterions, as they all differ from one"
another as much as church sects. One would-be instructor in the art of
reading says we ought all to study 'Tom Jones'--now I don't see the
the regular service and do so under efficient supervision. And there
was created the Government bureau designated as the Planetary
"Exploration Control Board, which was headed by Commander Stone."
*       *       *       *       *
Under this Board the exploration of the planets was undertaken
"methodically and efficiently, with a minimum of lives sacrificed."
"Mercury was charted, tested for essential minerals, and found to be a"
valueless rock heap too near the sun to support life.
Venus was visited and explored segment by segment; and friendly
relations were established with the rather stupid but peaceable people
found there.
Mars was mapped. Here the explorers had lingered a long time: and all
over this planet's surface were found remnants of a vast and intricate
"civilization--from the canals that laced its surface, to great cities"
with mighty buildings still standing. But of life there was none. The
atmosphere was too rare to support it; and the theory was that it had
constantly thinned through thousands of years till the last Martian
had gasped and died in air too attenuated to support life even in
creatures that must have grown greater and greater chested in eons of
adaptation.
Then Jupiter had been reached: and here the methodical planet by
"planet work promised to be checked for a long time to come. Jupiter,"
"with its mighty surface area, was going to take some exploring! It"
would be years before it could be plotted even superficially.
*       *       *       *       *
"Across the granary John Mortimer reclined with his head in his hands,"
making vows never to enter Spain or trust himself under the leadership
"of a mad Scot, if this once he should get clear off."
"""It isn't the being shot,"" he moaned; ""it's not being able to tell them"
"that I'm not a fool, but a respectable merchant able to pay my way and"
"with a balance at William Deacon's Bank. But it serves me right!"" Then a"
"little inconsequently he added, ""By gum, if I get out of this I'll have"
"a Spanish clerk in the works and learn the language!"""
Which was John Mortimer's way of making a vow to the gods.
"Etienne, having his hands comparatively free, and finding himself"
"sleepless, looked enviously at Rollo's untroubled repose, and began to"
twist cigarettes for himself and the sentry who guarded his side of the
granary.
"Without, the owls circled and cried. A dog barked in the village above,"
"provoking a far-reaching chorus of his kind. Then blows fell, and he"
fled yelping out of earshot.
Rollo was not wholly comfortable on his couch of grain. The bonds about
"his feet galled him, having been more tightly drawn than those of his"
companions in virtue of his chiefship. Nevertheless he got a good deal
"of sleep, and each time that he awoke it seemed to him that El Sarria"
was staring harder at the sentry and that the man had moved a little
nearer.
"At last, turning his head a little to one side, he heard distinctly the"
low murmur of voices.
"In less than a week Cæsar remained alone, knowing nobody in the hotel,"
and despite his believing that he was going to be perfectly indifferent
"about this, he felt deserted and sad. The influence of the springtime"
"also affected him. The deep blue sky, cloudless, dense, dark, made him"
"languish. Instead of entertaining himself with something or other, he"
did scarcely anything all day long but walk.
_TWO ABSURD MEN_
"“I have continually near me in the hotel,” wrote Cæsar to Alzugaray,"
“two absurd fellows: one is one of those stout red Germans with a square
"head; the other a fine slim Norwegian. The German, who is a captain in"
"some service or other, is a restless man, always busy about what the"
"devil I don’t know. He is constantly carrying about trunks and boxes,"
"with the aid of a sorrowful valet, dressed in black, who appears to"
detest his position. The captain must devote the morning to doing
"gymnastics, for I hear him from my room, which is next to his, jumping"
"and dropping weights on the floor, each of which must weigh half a ton,"
to judge by the noise they make.
"“He does all this to vocal commands, and when some feat doesn’t go right"
he reprimands himself.
"“This German isn’t still a moment; he opens the salon door, crosses the"
"room, stands at the window, takes up a paper, puts it down. He is a type"
that makes me nervous.
"“The Norwegian at first appeared to be a reasonable man, somewhat"
"all the world to see,"" returned Betty, arching her eyebrows."
"""To whom would it be directed, Betty?"" I asked, to tease her."
"A faint expression of reproach came to her eyes, but after a moment of"
"pretty hesitancy, she answered boldly:--"
"""Since you are so unwise as to ask, I'll answer in like folly. The letter"
"could be directed to but one person in the world--you."""
"I had received more than I had expected, and though I longed to make a"
"suitable return, I dared not for the sake of my vows, so we all remained"
"silent, and somewhat embarrassed, for a minute or two."
"Turning to Frances, I said: ""If you don't want me to read your letter,"
"I'll give you the key, and you may make it into cipher."" But after"
"examining the key, she declared that she could never learn to use it, and"
I suggested that she write a shorter letter in terms fit for a modest man

"The next day she handed me a shorter letter, saying that she had cut and"
"pruned it till there was nothing left worth sending, but I assured her"
that George would think otherwise.
"When I read the letter, my eyes were opened to the fact that there was"
more fire in Frances's heart than I had supposed any woman capable of
holding in subjection. But that is a mistake often made by men.

"It was a cold, clear, frosty night, and the Strand was at its busiest as"
Sallie looked out at it from the taxi into which Slyne and Ambrizette
"had followed her at the hotel portico. Another, containing Captain Dove"
"and their legal adviser, still on the most amicable terms, although"
"Captain Dove as a rule could not stand anyone afflicted with hiccough,"
"crawled close behind them through the turmoil until, at the Gaiety"
"corner, a policeman delayed it to let the cross-traffic through."
A crowd had gathered there to gaze at the royalties who would presently
be coming out of the theatre. Slyne drew Sallie back from the open
"window at sight of two men, one of whom seemed all shirt-front, looking"
down at the congested street from the empty steps of the principal
entrance.
"""That ass Ingoldsby!"" he explained to Sallie, and was evidently a good"
"deal disturbed. ""And--Dubois, as well,"" he added. ""I thought I had"
"shaken him off in Paris. I'm sure he saw me, too."""
A little farther on he stopped the taxi and beckoned to one of those
street-arabs who make a living about the kerb.
"""Go to the gentleman with the beard, on the steps of the Gaiety,"" he"
"instructed that very alert messenger, ""and say to him that a friend"
"wants a word with him here."""
Sallie observed the suppressed grimace of surprise on the face of the
individual who almost at once arrived in the wake of his ragged Mercury:
"and Slyne, having tossed the latter a shilling, held out his hand to M."
Dubois.
"their hearts as water within them. Their pet Valiant, old Gaspar Perico,"
"too, had judiciously hidden himself. Esteban the supple had accompanied"
"him, and the venta of Sarria was in the hands of the silent,"
"swift-footed, but exceedingly capable maid-servant who had played the"
trick upon Etienne.
"The Sarrians therefore watched the mill-house blaze up, and thanked God"
that it stood some way from the other dwellings of the place.
Suddenly Cabrera turned upon them.
"""Hearken ye, villagers of Sarria,"" he cried, ""I have burned the home of"
a traitor. If I hear of any shelter being granted to Luis Fernandez or
"his brother within your bounds, I swear by the martyred honour of my"
mother that on my return I will burn every house within your walls and
shoot every man of you capable of bearing arms. You have heard of Ramon
"Cabrera. Let that be enough."""
"The villagers got apprehensively behind each other, and none answered,"
"each waiting for the other, till with mighty bass thunder the voice rang"
out again:
"""Have you no answer?"" he cried, ""no promise? Must I set a dozen of you"
"with your backs against the wall, as I did at Espluga in Francoli, to"
"stimulate those dull country wits of yours?"""
Then a young man gaily dressed was thrust to the front. Very unwilling
"he was to show himself, and at his appearance, with his knees knocking"
"together, a merry laugh rang out from behind Cabrera."
That chieftain turned quickly with wrath in his eye. For it was a sound
"of a woman's mirth that was heard, and all such were strictly forbidden"
"most amazing new life, had put the past with all its horrors resolutely"
"behind her, was too much interested in the entertaining present to"
trouble about the future at the moment.
"Captain Dove had seemingly forgotten, for the time being at any rate,"
"his grievance against Slyne, and was in his most lamb-like mood. While"
Slyne did not even demur against the quantities of expensive wine the
"old man consumed during dinner. Mr. Jobling, too, was displaying"
symptoms of convivial hilarity when they at length left the restaurant.
But most of the other tables were empty by then.
"Mr. Jobling and Captain Dove, arm in arm, affectionately maintained each"
"other as far as their sitting-room, while Slyne accompanied Sallie to"
"her own door. He had been making himself most agreeable to her, and had"
pointed out a number of the notorieties and one or two of the
celebrities present; although it had somewhat startled her to be told
that she would very soon be on familiar terms with them all.
"""Aren't you glad now that you agreed to the bargain we made on the"
"_Olive Branch_--and in Monte Carlo?"" he asked by the way. He was smiling"
gaily.
"She smiled back at him, and, ""I'm not sorry--so far, Jasper,"" she"
"answered, looking deep into his eyes."
"He nodded, as if quite satisfied, and turned away to escape that"
embarrassing scrutiny.
"""We'll be starting in half an hour or so,"" he informed her from a safe"
"distance, and, ""I'll be all ready,"" she called cheerfully after him."
A little before eleven he came in again and they all set out for the
We had been summoned over the telephone to the Blake mansion by
"Reginald Blake, Mrs. Blake’s eldest son. Reginald had been very"
"reticent over the reason, but had seemed very anxious and insistent"
that Kennedy should come immediately.
"Craig read quickly and I followed him, fascinated by the letter from"
its very opening paragraph.
"“Dear Madam,” it began. “Having received my diploma as doctor of"
"medicine and bacteriology at Heidelberg in 1909, I came to the United"
States to study a most serious disease which is prevalent in several of
the western mountain states.”
"So far, I reflected, it looked like an ordinary appeal for aid. The"
"next words, however, were queer: “I have four hundred persons of wealth"
on my list. Your name was—”
Kennedy turned the page. On the next leaf of the letter sheet was
pasted a strip of gelatine. The first page had adhered slightly to the
gelatine.
"“Chosen by fate,” went on the sentence ominously."
"“By opening this letter,” I read, “you have liberated millions of the"
virulent bacteria of this disease. Without a doubt you are infected by
"this time, for no human body is impervious to them, and up to the"
present only one in one hundred has fully recovered after going through
all its stages.”
I gasped. The gelatine had evidently been arranged so that when the two
"sheets were pulled apart, the germs would be thrown into the air about"
the person opening the letter. It was a very ingenious device.
and serene in her undisputed position. In her childish days her material
kingdom was limited to the walls of her sea-chamber but as the child
"expanded into the young girl, so expanded her conception of the limits"
of her kingdom. And with this widening view came gradually and curiously
the consciousness that though her uncle and aunt were exquisitely
"honoured and beloved agents who looked to the welfare of her realm,"
yet they could not relieve her of certain gracious responsibilities.
"Instinctively, and with imperceptible gradations, she began to make"
her influence felt in the house itself. But it was an influence in the
spiritual and not material sense of the word; the hovering presence and
not the controlling hand.
"When, shortly after the arrival of the two men, Walter Herold went up to"
"his room, he found a great vase of daffodils on his dressing-table and"
"a pencilled note from Stella in her unformed handwriting, for one cannot"
learn to write copper-plate when one lies forever on the flat of one's
back.
"_Great High Favourite: Here are some daffodils, because they laugh and"
dance like you. Stellamaris._
And on his dressing-table John Risca found a mass of snowdrops and a
note:
_Great High Belovedest: A beautiful white silver cloud came to my window
"to-day, and I wished I could tear it in half and save you a bit for the"
palace. But snowdrops are the nearest things I could think of instead.
Your telegram was a joy. Love. S._
Beside the bowl of flowers was another note:
"_I heard the wheels of your chariot, but Her Serene High-and-Mightiness"
"going to be: all the wind tunnel tests, all the computer simulations,"
even the supersonic test flights--everything said go. _Daedalus I_ was
going to make history tomorrow morning.
"Except, he told himself, it's going to be a very different history from"
the one everybody expects.
"""Major Yuri Andreevich Androv, please report to Hangar Quadrant"
"immediately."""
The stridency of the facility's paging system always annoyed him. He
"glanced at the long line of computer screens one last time, then"
shrugged and checked his watch. Who wanted him?
"Well, a new planeload of Soviet VIPs reportedly had flown in yesterday,"
though he hadn't seen any of them yet. He figured now that everything
"looked ready, the _nomenklatura _were flooding in to bask in triumph."
Maybe after a day of vodka drinking and back slapping with the
"officials in Project Management, they'd sobered up and realized they"
were expected to file reports. So they were finally getting around to
talking to the people who were doing the actual work. They'd summon in
a few staffers who had hands-on knowledge of the project and commission
"a draft report, which they'd then file, unread, under their own names."
Typical.
"He reached for his leather flight jacket, deciding on a brisk walk to"
work off the tension. The long corridor leading from the East Quadrant
to the Hangar Quadrant took him directly past Checkpoint Central and
"the entry to West Quadrant, the Soviet sector, which also contained the"
"flight simulator and the main wind tunnel, or Number One, both now"

aviator had survived the shock and was hurriedly unbuckling the strap
that held him to his seat.
"""Boat's done for, sir,"" announced one of the would-be crew. Such was"
the case. The explosion of a shell had wrenched her keel and
garboards out of her.
"""Then overboard with that!"" ordered Terence, indicating a Carley"
"life-buoy, which, though scorched by the blast of the shells, was"
still practically intact.
"The Carley life-buoy is a ""new departure"" in life-saving appliances"
on board ships of the Royal Navy. It is a glorified edition of an
"ordinary buoy, but elongated in shape and provided with gratings, and"
capable of being propelled by oars.
Half a dozen bluejackets seized the huge buoy and slung it overboard.
Held by means of a line it floated alongside the cruiser until
Terence and three men clambered into it.
Although the rate of propulsion was not by any means so rapid as that
of a boat the progress of the rescuers was far from slow. More than
once they were splashed by the spray thrown up by a ricochetting
"projectile, as the German gunlayers were gradually correcting their"
"aim, yet unscathed the rescue party came alongside the gradually"
sinking seaplane.
"""Hullo, Aubyn!"" shouted a well-known voice."
The airman was Waynsford. In his pneumatic helmet and huge goggles he
"was unrecognizable, but his voice proclaimed his identity."
"hard and painful; as biscuit was the only available food, no"
nourishment was taken. The bowels acted on the second night. At
the end of a week the patient was sent by bullock wagon (three
"days and nights) to Modder River, and then down to Capetown,"
"where he walked into the hospital on the thirteenth day,"
apparently well.
"Two days later the temperature rose to 104°, and enteric fever"
"was diagnosed, no local signs pointing to the injury existing."
The patient made a good recovery.
"(173) Wounded at Colenso. _Entry_ (Mauser), at junction of"

"iliac spine to umbilicus; _exit_, at upper part of right great"
"sacro-sciatic foramen, in line of posterior superior iliac"
spine. Advancing on foot when struck; he then fell and crept
"fifty yards to behind a rock, where he remained seven and a"
half hours. For two days subsequently he vomited freely; the
"bowels acted nine hours after the injury, and then became"
"constipated. No further symptoms were noted, and at the end of"
three weeks the abdomen was absolutely normal. The man is now
again on active service.
(174*) Wounded at Modder River while retiring on foot. _Entry_
"(Mauser), at highest point of right iliac crest; _exit_, 2-1/2"
inches to right of and 1/2 inch above level of umbilicus. The
"injury was not followed by sickness, and the bowels remained"
confined. During the first two days 'pain struck across the
abdomen' when micturition was performed.
When the patient came under observation on the third day the
"condition was as follows:--Complains of little pain,"
"d’hôtes_, at whirlwind lunch counters, on sandwiches and beer in his"
"hall-bedroom. He was willing to do that, for he was a true son of the"
"great city of razzle-dazzle, and to him one evening in the limelight"
made up for many dark ones.
Chandler protracted his walk until the Forties began to intersect the
"great and glittering primrose way, for the evening was yet young, and"
"when one is of the _beau monde_ only one day in seventy, one loves to"
"protract the pleasure. Eyes bright, sinister, curious, admiring,"
"provocative, alluring were bent upon him, for his garb and air"
proclaimed him a devotee to the hour of solace and pleasure.
"At a certain corner he came to a standstill, proposing to himself the"
question of turning back toward the showy and fashionable restaurant in
which he usually dined on the evenings of his especial luxury. Just
"then a girl scuddled lightly around the corner, slipped on a patch of"
icy snow and fell plump upon the sidewalk.
Chandler assisted her to her feet with instant and solicitous courtesy.
"The girl hobbled to the wall of the building, leaned against it, and"
thanked him demurely.
"“I think my ankle is strained,” she said. “It twisted when I fell.”"
“Does it pain you much?” inquired Chandler.
“Only when I rest my weight upon it. I think I will be able to walk in
a minute or two.”
"“If I can be of any further service,” suggested the young man, “I will"
"call a cab, or—”"
"The water’s dropping every minute, and we’ve got a mean stretch to cover"
before we strike the Penobscot. I’ll go back and hustle the rear
along----”
"He stopped abruptly, and whirled around as a voice, shrill and trembling"
"with passion, was raised behind him."
"“You’ll pay for that, you meddlin’ pup! I’ll teach you to go blowin’ up"
"folks’ property, an’ mighty near committin’ murder! I’ll show you you"
can’t play tricks on John Joyce an’ get away with it. That game might
"work with some, but it won’t----”"
Things happened so swiftly after that that even the men standing around
"were quite unable to understand exactly what was doing, and which of the"
two was really the one who started the trouble.
The instant Bob turned he saw that Joyce was either beside himself with
"rage, or giving a most astonishingly good imitation of that condition."
"His face was purple, with veins standing out on his forehead like cords."
His eyes glared with that combination of rage and hate which a badly
frightened man almost invariably feels for the cause of his mental
"disturbance. The automatic was leveled in his hand, and one finger"
trembled on the trigger.
"For a single instant Bainbridge stood rigid, every muscle suddenly"
tensing. Perhaps he read a hint of Joyce’s purpose in the fellow’s eye;
perhaps it was simply intuition which made him guess what was coming. At
"all events, suddenly, and without warning, he launched his lithe body"
through the air exactly as in the manner of the old forbidden flying
tackle.
"His shoulder struck Joyce’s knees, and the wicked, snapping shot of the"
presently be an armistice and Germany would have to make peace with
"perhaps the cession to France of Metz as a _solatium_, while Germany"
"was given a little bit more of Africa, and Austria got nothing...."
Meantime the Villa Beau-séjour seemed after Holloway Prison a
paradise upon earth. Why quarrel with her fate? Why not drop
politics and take up philosophy? She felt herself capable of writing
a Universal History which would be far truer if more cynical than
any previous attempt to show civilized man the route he had followed
and the martyrdom he had undergone.
On the 17th of August she took the tram into Brussels. It seemed
"however as if it would never get there, and when she reached the"
Porte de Namur she was too impatient to wait for the connection. She
"could not find any gendarme, but at a superior-looking flower-shop"
she obtained the address of the British Legation.
She asked at the lodge for Mr. Hawk; but there was only a Belgian
"coachman in charge, and he told her the Minister and his staff had"
followed the Court to Antwerp. Mr. Hawk had only left that morning.
"""What a nuisance,"" said Vivie to herself. ""I might have found out"
from him whether there is any truth in the rumours that are flying
"about Tervueren."""
These rumours were to the effect that the Germans had captured all
"the forts of Liège and their brave defender, General Léman; that"
"they were in Namur and were advancing on Louvain. ""I wonder what we"
"had better do?"" pondered Vivie."
In her bewilderment she took the bold step of calling at the Hotel
"de Ville, gave her name and nationality, and asked the advice of"
the municipal employé who saw her as to what course she and her
"rays of living lightning, of which neither painter nor poet has any"
"true conception, . . long, dazzling rays such as encircled God's"
"maiden, Edris, with an arch of roseate effulgence, so that the very air"
was sunset-colored in the splendor of her presence! How if she were a
"wingless angel,--made woman?"
"""Glory is thine, and gladness, and the wings!"" And with the name of his"
angel-love upon his lips he closed his eyes and sank into a deep and
dreamless slumber.
CHAPTER XL.
IN THE CATHEDRAL.
"A booming, thunderous, yet mellow sound! a grand, solemn, sonorous"
"swing of full and weighty rhythm, striking the air with deep, slowly"
"measured resonance like the rolling of close cannon! Awake, all ye"
people!--Awake to prayer and praise! for the Night is past and sweet
"Morning reddens in the east, ... another Day is born,--a day in which"
"to win God's grace and pardon,--another wonder of Light, Movement,"

"present joy of life,--this life, dear harbinger of life to come! open"
"your eyes, ye drowsy mortals, to the divine blue of the beneficent sky,"
"the golden beams of the sun, the color of flowers, the foliage of"
"trees, the flash of sparkling waters!--open your ears to the singing of"
"birds, the whispering of winds, the gay ripple of children's laughter,"
"the soft murmurs of home affection,--for all these things are freely"
"bestowed upon you with each breaking dawn, and will you offer unto God"

"Katsura."""
"""It met the specifications?"""
"Ikeda nodded. ""Yesterday I ordered a computer analysis of the data"
"tapes. The preliminary report suggests it may even have exceeded them."""
Tanzan Mino listened in silence. He was sitting at his desk in the
command sector wing of the North Quadrant at the Hokkaido facility.
"Although the sector was underground, like the rest of the facility,"
"behind his desk was a twenty-foot-long ""window"" with periscope double"
mirrors that showed the churning breakers of La Perouse Strait.
His jet had touched down on the facility's runway at 6:48 A.M. and been
promptly towed into the hangar. Tanzan Mino intended to be in personal
"command when _Daedalus I_ went hypersonic, in just nineteen hours. The"
video monitors in his office were hard-wired directly to the main
"console in Flight Control, replicating its data displays, and all"
decisions passed across his desk.
"""Leave the pilot to me,"" he said without emotion, revolving to gaze out"
"the wide window, which displayed the mid-afternoon sun catching the"
"crests of whitecaps far at sea. ""What he knows or doesn't know will not"
"disrupt the schedule."""
"Once again, he thought, I've got to handle a problem personally. Why?"
Because nobody else here has the determination to make the scenario
"succeed. First the protocol, and then the money. I had to intervene to"
resolve both.
"But, he reflected with a smile, it turned out that handling those"
the identity of the woman and the reason of her presence alone with
Marsh in such a place. Again he thought of that mysterious third person
"whose movements had been so swift and furious, but his conjectures left"
him more at sea than ever. Of one thing he felt sure. It was not enmity
alone that prompted Marsh to accuse him of the stabbing. The man was
"concealing something, in deadly fear of the truth, for rather than"
submit to questioning he had let his enemy go scot-free.
"Suddenly Boyd paused in his walk, recalling again the shadowy outlines"
of the figure with whom he had so nearly collided on his way up from
"the beach. There was something familiar about it, he mused; then, with"
"a low whistle of surprise, he smote his palms together. He began to see"
dimly.
For more than an hour the young man paced back and forth before the
"door of his sleeping-quarters, so deeply immersed in thought that only"
"the breaking storm drove him within. When at last he retired, it was"
with the certainty that this night had placed a new weapon in his hand;
"but of what tremendous value it was destined to prove, he little knew."
CHAPTER XXII
THE SILVER HORDE
The main body of salmon struck into the Kalvik River on the first day
"of July. For a week past the run had been slowly growing, while the"
"canneries tested themselves, but on the opening day of the new month"
PEACOCKS
Early the next day Pola appeared with Mr. Dugald in Sunset Lane in a
simple garb that must have satisfied even her exacting cousin. Her mood
was in accord with her attire as though she had left her sophistication
"behind with her silks and her rouge. She declared she felt as ""peppy as"
"they make them"" and ready to do anything anyone suggested. And Mr."
"Dugald, resigned to wasting two weeks to entertaining his young cousin,"
"of whom he was really very fond, promptly offered an astonishing"
assortment of suggestions from which he commanded the girls to choose.
"""Why, you wouldn't believe there were so many things to do!"" cried Pola"
"with real enthusiasm. ""Sidney, you'll have to decide."" And Sidney at"
once decided upon a tramp to Peaked Hill on the ocean side with an
early picnic supper.
"In the days that followed, Sidney's first admiration for Pola returned."
Though Pola would never again be the idol she was much more enjoyable
"as a chum. Her spirits, though an affectation, were infectious and gay;"
in her pretty clothes and with her pretty face she made Sidney think of
"a butterfly, a fragile, golden-winged, dainty flitting butterfly. She"
professed to enjoy everything they did--even to the picnics. She
tramped endlessly in her unsuitable shoes without a murmur of fatigue
and Sidney suspected that she really _did_ care a great deal for her
cousin Dugald's approval.
With Mr. Dugald they motored to Highland Light and to Chatham. They
toured the shops at Hyannis. They sailed with Captain Hawkes on the
_Mabel T_. They rose very early one morning and went to the Coast Guard
Station to watch the drill and then ate ham and eggs with Commander
"steel-grey sea with wistful, far-away eyes."
At his instigation she veiled herself very closely. And he had brought
with him a hooded cloak for Ambrizette. No one took any particular
notice of the inconspicuous party which presently left the Hôtel de
"Paris in a hired car, as if for an excursion along the coast."
At a station fifty miles away they left the car and caught the
"night-mail for Paris. Slyne's baggage was on board it, in the care of a"
"sullen chauffeur, and there were also berths reserved for them all."
"""Did you see any more of Dubois?"" Sallie heard Slyne ask the man, who"
shook his head indifferently in reply.
The long night-journey passed without other incident than a dispute
"between Captain Dove and the sleeping-car attendant, which raged until"
Slyne threatened to have the train stopped at the next station and send
for the police. And the sun was shining brightly when they reached
Paris.
"Mr. Jobling went straight on to London, but Slyne took Sallie and"
"Captain Dove to a quiet but expensive hotel, where they remained for a"
"few days, which passed in a perfect whirl of novelty and excitement for"
"her. And when they in their turn crossed the Channel, she had for"
baggage at least a dozen new trunks containing the choicest spoils of
the Rue de la Paix. Slyne had pooh-poohed all her timid protests against
"his lavish expenditure on her account, and had also provided for Captain"
Dove and Ambrizette in their degree. He had evidently a fortune at his
"disposal, and was bent on showing her how generous he could be."
He was also unostentatiously displaying other good qualities which had
all gone to make those days pass very pleasantly for her. She could not
"""Some of them,"" returned Villiers cautiously--""Not all. Not the Sunday"
"ones, for instance."""
"""Still, you can't possibly have helped seeing my descriptions of famous"
"people 'At Home,' you know! I write for ever so many journals. I"
"think""--and she became complacently reflective--""I think I may say with"
perfect truth that I have interviewed everybody who has ever done
"anything worth noting, from our biggest provision dealer to our latest"
sensational novelist! And all my articles are signed 'Tiger-Lily.' NOW
"do you remember? Oh, you MUST remember? ... I am so VERY well known!"""
There was a touch of genuine anxiety in her voice that was almost
"pathetic, but Villiers made no attempt to soothe her wounded vanity."
"""I have no recollection whatever of the name,"" he said bluntly--""But"
"that is easily accounted for, as I never read newspaper descriptions of"
"celebrities. So you are an 'interviewer' for the Press?"""
"""Exactly!"" and the lady leaned back more comfortably in the Louis"
"Quatorze fauteuil--""And of course I want to interview Mr. Alwyn. I"
"want..."" here drawing out a business looking note-book from her pocket"
she opened it and glanced at the different headings therein
"enumerated,--""I want to describe his personal appearance,--to know when"
"he was born, and where he was educated,--whether his father or mother"
"had literary tastes,--whether he had, or has, brothers or sisters, or"
"both,--whether he is married, or likely to be, and how much money he"
"has made by his book."" She paused and gave an upward glance at"
"Villiers, who returned it with a blank and stony stare."
"""Then,""--she resumed energetically--""I wish to know what are his"
methods of work;--WHERE he gets his ideas and HOW he elaborates
"them,--how many hours he writes at a time, and whether he is an early"
"""Sounds like raving, sonny. Who the dickens is Basil the Wolf? No, Jack,"
"that doesn't tell us anything."""
"""It tells us he couldn't have been inspired like that unless the place"
"and people were real to him!"""
"""Well, pirate or priest,"" Tommy laughed, ""he'll do if he waltzes us up"
"to the big adventure. You're about fit enough to tackle one now!"" During"
the past forty-eight hours he had openly rejoiced with Gates at my
"improvement and tried, with the indifferent success of an unbeliever, to"
play up at top speed that silly idea of an approaching adventure.
"We had strolled aft, and now stopped to watch a tall Jamaica negro--or"
so we thought him to be--asking Gates for a place in the crew. His
"clothing was too scant to hide the great muscles beneath, and Tommy"
"touched my arm, saying:"
"""There's a specimen for you!"""
"Had he been cast in bronze a critic might have said that the sculptor,"
"by over-idealizing masculine perfection, had made the waist too small,"
"the hips too slender, for the powerful chest and shoulders; the wrists"
and ankles might have been thought too delicate as terminals for the
"massive sinews leading into them. He smiled continually, and spoke in a"
"soft, almost timid voice."
"""I like that big fellow,"" I said. Perhaps I had been well called a"
"pantheist, having always extravagantly admired the perfect in form or"
face or the wide outdoors.
"Feeling my interests he turned from Gates, looking at me with dog-like"
pathetic trustfulness. Among the things he told us briefly--for the crew
gridded with radio location finders so accurate that the position of
two ships a hundred yards apart shows a hundred yards of difference in
absolute position in the loran.
Some day in the distant future space would be solid-gridded with
infrawave navigation signals. Then the space coordinates of any
spacecraft could be found to a fine degree of precision. But now all
that Wilson and his nav-techs could do was to keep sighting the fixed
"stars, and from them compute their position."
"This sort of space navigation was good enough to keep a ship on course,"
"but far from precise enough to pinprick a true position. But, after"
"all, a crude positioning in the middle of interstellar space is good"
enough. One literally has cubic light years to float around in. Once
"the spacecraft begins to approach a destination, the space positioning"
can be made.
"Again, few spacecraft pause in mid-flight between stars long enough to"
"care about their interstellar position. After all, space flight does"
provide a mode of travel where the destination lies within eyesight.
"Or rather, it has lain within eyesight ever since it became commonly"

England might claim a large section of Persia as her sphere of
"influence, and Egypt likewise and a fourth part of Africa, much of"
"Arabia, and Cyprus in the Mediterranean, why might not Germany and"
Austria expect to have their little spheres of influence in the

"Yet this brutal invasion of France, this unprovoked attack on Liège"
were ugly things. France had shown no disposition to egg Servia on

And the War must soon be over. Europe as a whole could not allow
this devastation of resources. America would intervene. Already the
Germans realized their gigantic blunder in starting the attack.

impossible that a frail aeroplane could exist amid that tornado of

In the meantime he received the news of the papal absolution. In

soil. In Ammonius's house of Saint Stephen's Chapel at Westminster on 9
"April 1517, the ceremony of absolution took place, ridding Erasmus for"
good of the nightmare which had oppressed him since his youth. At last
he was free!
Invitations and specious promises now came to him from all sides.
Mountjoy and Wolsey spoke of high ecclesiastical honours which awaited
him in England. Budaeus kept pressing him to remove to France. Cardinal
"Ximenes wanted to attach him to the University of Alcalá, in Spain. The"
Duke of Saxony offered him a chair at Leipzig. Pirckheimer boasted of
"the perfections of the free imperial city of Nuremberg. Erasmus,"
"meanwhile, overwhelmed again with the labour of writing and editing,"
"according to his wont, did not definitely decline any of these offers;"
neither did he accept any. He always wanted to keep all his strings on
his bow at the same time. In the early summer of 1517 he was asked to
"accompany the court of the youthful Charles, who was on the point of"
leaving the Netherlands for Spain. But he declined. His departure to
Spain would have meant a long interruption of immediate contact with the
"great publishing centres, Basle, Louvain, Strassburg, Paris, and that,"
"in turn, would have meant postponement of his life-work. When, in the"
"beginning of July, the prince set out for Middelburg, there to take ship"
"for Spain, Erasmus started for Louvain."
"He was thus destined to go to this university environment, although it"
"displeased him in so many respects. There he would have academic duties,"

Meanwhile Cabrera had been bending his brows over the note which had
been directed to him personally. He rose and paced the length of the

with an unmoved countenance. Presently he stopped opposite the young man
and stood regarding him intently.

and several other prizes. After careening their vessels on the coast of
"Virginia, the pirates took a fine French Guineaman bound to Martinico;"
"this ship they armed with forty guns, named her the _Queen Ann's Revenge_,"
and Blackbeard went aboard as captain. Teach now had a ship that allowed
"him to go for larger prizes, and he began by taking a big ship called the"

"Teach was attacked by H.M.S. _Scarborough_, of thirty guns, but after a"

The next ship he met with was the sloop of that amateur pirate and

Against the class-interest behind the East India Company the republican
"party, as led and represented by De Witt, were strongly arrayed. They"
could point to the expansion of the Greenland whaling trade that had
followed on the abolition of the original monopoly in that adventure--an
increase of from ten to fifteen times the old quantity of
product[818]--and the treatise expounding their policy strongly
condemned the remaining monopolies of all kinds. But there was no
sufficient body of enlightened public opinion to support the attack; and
the menaced interests spontaneously turned to the factor which could
best maintain them against such pressure--the military power of the
"House of Orange. The capitalist monopolists and ""imperialists"" of the"
republic were thus the means first of artificially limiting its economic
"basis, and later of subverting its republican constitution--a disservice"
"which somewhat outweighs the credit earned by them, as by the merchant"
"oligarchies of Venice, for an admirable management of their army.[819]"

"Strange--his watch was still going, but he himself was dead. The doctor"
"could do nothing here, and returned to his village."
There followed a depressing evening. Solem went to the village to send a
"telegram to the lawyer's family, and the rest of us did what we thought"
decent under the circumstances: we all sat in the living room with books
"in our hands. Now and again, some reference would be made to the accident:"
"it was a reminder, we said, how small we mortals were! And the Associate"
"Master, who had not the soul of a tourist, greatly feared that this"
disaster would injure the resort and make things still more difficult for
Paul; people would shun a place where they were likely to fall off and be
killed.
"No, the Associate Master was no tourist, and did not understand the"
Anglo-Saxon mind.
Paul himself seemed to sense that the accident might benefit him rather
than do him harm. He brought out a bottle of brandy to console us on this
mournful evening.

"Stumbling and slipping over the broken ground in the pitch darkness,"
"the lamp barely lighting up my immediate path, I had wandered some"
distance from the car when I heard voices. Instantly I thought of the
"Raiders who were over-running the district. It would be too galling,"
"too humiliating to be captured by them before the campaign, on which"
"I was building such high hopes, had even begun."
Noiselessly I put out the lamp and listened in the dense darkness.
"There was absolute silence for some minutes, and I stood stock still."
"Then voices sounded again, and I conjectured that there were not more"
"than two, or at the most three, speakers."
"I thought rapidly, and finally decided that there would not be many"
men in front of me. Had there been anything approaching an encampment
"of the Raiders in the neighbourhood, there would have been lights,"
camp fires and considerable noise. The voices I had heard probably
"belonged to men who had seen the lights of the car, and had come to"
find out what it was.
"I turned swiftly and made my way back to the car, where I had"
foolishly left my revolver. Recovering my weapon I warned Allan in a
"whisper of the voices I had heard, and told him to be ready to stand"

"83,655. The title of professor at a college or University should carry"
"with it dignity and honour, and ought not to be so freely used as at"

"83,657. (Mr. Fisher). The witness desired to secure for India Europeans"
who had European reputations in their different branches of study. If it
"was necessary to go outside India or England to procure good men, he"
would prefer to go to Germany. This was the practice in America where
they were annexing all the great intellects of Europe.
"83,658. The witness would like to see India entering the world movement"
in the advance and march of knowledge. It was of the highest importance
that there should be an intellectual atmosphere in India. It would be
of advantage if there were many Indians in the Educational Service. For
"they came more in contact with the people, and influenced their"
"intellectual activity. Besides, on retirement they would live in India"
and their life experience would be at their countrymen's service.

"As can be imagined there was a great deal of noise, the native"
drivers gesticulating and talking in a way which proved that
something was afoot. I got out of the car and asked who was in charge
"of the caravan. A huge native contractor was pointed out to me, and,"
summoning him to my side I asked him what all the hubbub was about.
He was in a state of great agitation and told me that he had received
information from several reliable sources that the whole of the
"countryside ahead of them was in the hands of the Raiders, and that,"
"therefore, it was useless to go a step further."
"I expostulated with the man, pointing out that, by the terms of his"
"contract, he must go on, and that if he did not the soldiers for whom"
he was bringing supplies would die of starvation.
But he was dogged. He knew too well the methods of the Raiders with
the men they captured.
"""It's no use, Sahib,"" he said, respectfully but firmly. ""My men will"
"not go on as they are unarmed, and a single armed Raider is enough to"
"hold up the whole caravan."""

Raiders and to win through.

came to be known as the “Old Version.”
"d. _The Bay Psalm Book_, Boston, 1640. This was the first book printed"
in English-speaking America. It was made to obtain greater literalness
to the Hebrew original than was found in the versions then in use. The
book reigned supreme among the English churches in New England for over
"a century. Seventy editions of it were printed in America, the last in"
"1773. Eighteen editions appeared in England, and twenty-two in Scotland."
"There were no tunes given it until 1698, then only 13, with the air in"
the bass.
"e. _The Scottish Psalter_, completed 1650. Special mention is made of"
this version of the Psalms because it is the source of nearly all the
selections of metrical psalms which constitute Book Five of the
_Hymnary_. The number of versions and editions of psalms which appeared
"on the Continent and in England were numerous and confusing, each"
"claiming its own special merits. Finally, in the interests of better"
literary diction and greater unity in singing in the Scottish
"Presbyterian churches, the General Assembly authorized a new version."
"The result, after many years’ work, was the famous _Scottish Psalter_ of"
1650 which remains the standard work in Scotland today.
There is a certain “dignified crudeness” in some of the literary
expressions but the psalms have long been learned in this version and
have become an important part of the religious training and experience
"of millions of English speaking people, especially in Scotland."
The Scottish Psalter first appeared with words only. There were no notes
and no suggestions for melodies. The succeeding one hundred years were a
"time of confusion. The tunes used were few in number, such as the"
"leaders had learned from various sources, and passed on to succeeding"
generations by rote. The time came when better singing and better tunes

About fifty years ago in a village named Okshitgon were born two
"children, a boy and a girl. They were born on the same day in"
"neighbouring houses, and they grew up together, and played together, and"
"loved each other. And in due course they married and started a family,"
"and maintained themselves by cultivating their dry, barren fields about"
"the village. They were always known as devoted to each other, and they"
died as they had lived--together. The same death took them on the same
day; so they were buried without the village and were forgotten; for the
times were serious.
"It was the year after the English army had taken Mandalay, and all Burma"
"was in a fury of insurrection. The country was full of armed men, the"
"roads were unsafe, and the nights were lighted with the flames of"
"burning villages. It was a bad time for peace-loving men, and many such,"
"fleeing from their villages, took refuge in larger places nearer the"
centres of administration.
Okshitgon was in the midst of one of the worst of all the distressed
"districts, and many of its people fled, and one of them, a man named"
"Maung Kan, with his young wife went to the village of Kabyu and lived"

Concha flashed them from her bosom and laid them in the general's hands.
"Usually Cabrera was blind to female charms, but upon this occasion his"
eye rested with pleasure on the quick and subtle grace of the Andaluse.

dress.
"""Ah, no,"" replied Concha, thinking with some hopefulness that she was to"
"have at least a hearing, ""I am not even a lay sister. The good Lady"
Superior had need of a housekeeper--one who should be free of the
convent and yet able to transact business without the walls. It is a
serious thing (as your honour knows) to provision even a hundred men who

The rest must wait till he had talked with Gyp.
"There was much to do, and it was late before they dined, and not till"
Markey had withdrawn could they begin their talk.
Close to the open windows where Markey had placed two hydrangea
"plants--just bought on his own responsibility, in token of silent"
"satisfaction--Gyp began.  She kept nothing back, recounting the whole"
miserable fiasco of her marriage.  When she came to Daphne Wing and her
"discovery in the music-room, she could see the glowing end of her"
father's cigar move convulsively.  That insult to his adored one seemed
"to Winton so inconceivable that, for a moment, he stopped her recital by"
getting up to pace the room.  In her own house--her own house!
"And--after that, she had gone on with him! He came back to his chair and"
"did not interrupt again, but his stillness almost frightened her."
"Coming to the incidents of the day itself, she hesitated.  Must she tell"
"him, too, of Rosek--was it wise, or necessary?  The all-or-nothing"
"candour that was part of her nature prevailed, and she went straight on,"
"and, save for the feverish jerking of his evening shoe, Winton made no"
"sign.  When she had finished, he got up and slowly extinguished the end"
of his cigar against the window-sill; then looking at her lying back in

whole heart and soul and mind of the Girl seemed to be reaching out

forestall a shot from the Sheriff. It seemed hours until the road agent
"reached the bottom of the ladder, then lurched with unseeing eyes to a"
"chair and, finally, fell forward limply, with his arms and head resting"

"""We might open the cottage for a few days, Gates,"" I said, as we were"
getting into the motor.
"""Bless you, sir,"" he replied, caressing a weather-beaten chin with thumb"
"and finger, ""the _Whim_'s been tugging at her cable mighty fretful this"
"parst fortnight! The crew hoped you'd be coming aboard at once, sir."
"Fact is, we're wanting to be told how you and Mr. Thomas, here, licked"
"those Germans."""
"""Angels of the Marne protect me,"" Tommy groaned. ""Gates, I wouldn't"
"resurrect those scraps for the Kaiser's scalp!"""
"""Yes, he will,"" I promised, smiling at the old fellow's look of"
"disappointment. ""He'll probably talk you to death, though; that's the"
"only trouble."""
"""I'll tell you what,"" Tommy said, ""we'll chuck the cottage idea and go"
"aboard; then tonight, Gates, you pipe the crew--if that's the nautical"
"term--whereupon I'll hold a two-hour inquest over our deceased war, on"
condition that we bury the subject forever more. We came down here to
"lose the last eighteen months of our lives, Gates, not keep 'em green."
"Maybe you don't know it, but we're after the big adventure!"""
"His eyes twinkled as he said this, and his face was lighted by a rare"
smile that no one possessed more engagingly than Tommy. While he treated
"sun shone no more, and the merriment was stilled for ever. So she"
"thought, and, if she were not right, it needed a philosopher to tell her"
"so; and then she would not have believed him, but caught her woe closer"
"to her heart, and nursed it with fiercer tenderness against his shallow"
"prating. Perhaps he might have told her too, that it is cruel kindness"
"unasked to set people on a pinnacle, and, when they cannot keep foothold"
"on that slippery height, to scorn their fall. Other things such an one"
"might well have said, but more wisely left unsaid; for cool reason is a"
"blister to heartache, and heartache is not best cured by blisters. Never"
yet did a child stop crying for being told its pain was nought and would
soon be gone. Yet this prescription had been Lady Eynesford's--although
"she was no philosopher, to her knowledge--for Alicia, and it had left"
"the patient protesting that she felt no pain at all, and yet feeling it"
all the more.
"""What do you accuse me of? Why do you speak to me?"" she had burst out."
"""What is it to me what he has done or not done? What do you mean, Mary?"""
Before this torrent of questions Lady Eynesford tactfully retreated a
little way. A warning against hasty love dwindled to an appeal whether
"so much friendliness, such constant meetings, either with daughter or"
"with father, were desirable."
"""I'm sure I'm sorry for the poor child,"" she said; ""but in this"
"world----"""
"""Suppose it's all a slander!"""
"""My dear Alicia, do they say such things about a man in his position"
"unless there's something in them?"""
"""It's nothing to me,"" said Alicia again."
"inadvertently upon the last occasion it was used, exploded. The man’s"
"arm had been wrenched off, and he was burned terribly. It was a stroke"
of luck that the liner hove in sight at the moment she did. There was
"no chance of extending succour to the injured man on the spot, and he"
would have died before a doctor could have been summoned by boat from
"Ballycastle, nine miles away. The surgeon bound up the man’s injuries,"
"lowered him into his boat, and, on regaining the liner, placed him"
"in the hospital, where he was tended until the vessel’s arrival in"
"Liverpool, where he was landed and placed in hospital."

More remarkable was the accident which happened at the Flannen Islands
light-station in 1900; it remains an unsolved mystery to this day. This
"is one of Scotland’s lonely lights, mounting guard over a group of"
islets fifteen miles off the Hebrides. On December 26 the relief-tender
"approached the station on her usual fortnightly visit, but, to the"
"amazement of those on board, no signs of the keepers or the usual"
"signals were to be seen, while the lantern was not dressed in its"
"daylight garb. The crew landed hurriedly, wondering what was amiss."
They found the lighthouse absolutely deserted; not a sign of any of the
"three keepers was to be seen or heard. They examined the log, and found"
"that the light had not been burning for some days, the last entry being"
"made about 4 a.m. nearly a week previously. The rock was searched, but"
yielded no clue to the mystery of the complete disappearance of the
"83,664. (Mr. Chaubal). He did not know whether the salaries he had"
"mentioned as having been paid in Japan, New Zealand and Yale were on an"
incremental scale or not.
"83,665. There was a difference of kind between the way in which"
students were taught in schools and the way in which they were taught in
colleges. He did not agree with the witnesses who had said that during
the first year or two years at college the instruction given was similar
to that given in a school. It was very difficult to disprove or to prove
such statements. There would be no advantage in keeping boys to a school
course up the intermediate standard and making the colleges deal with
only those students who had passed the intermediate examination.
"83,666. (Sir Theodore Morison). There should be one scale of pay for all"
"persons in the higher educational department. The rate of salary, Rs."
"200 rising to Rs. 1,500 per month, was suitable, subject to the proviso"
"that the man of great distinction, instead of beginning at the lowest"
"rate of pay, should start some where in the middle of the list, say, at"
Rs. 400 or Rs. 500. He would make no reference in regard to Europeans or
Indians in that respect. In effect this no doubt amounted to making
Indians eligible for higher educational posts both by direct recruitment
and by promotion.
"83,667. He would not favour the handing over of all the Government"
institutions in Bengal to private agencies; there must be one or two
Government colleges in order to keep up the standard. He should be
sorry to see the Government dissociating itself from one of its primary
"duties, which was education."
"83,668. Privately managed Colleges paid less in salary than the"
Government Colleges. They paid about the same as was given in the
"""Stop him!"" yelled the commander."
"A dozen men hastened to comply, jolting against each other in their"
"alacrity to pursue the animal, which with marvellous agility had"
gained the extremity of the signal yard-arm.
"Here he perched, hanging on with his hind paws while he tasted each"
coin with his teeth--at first with an expression of hopefulness upon
his features that rapidly changed into one of profound disgust.
Holding the rest of the coins against his chest Mephisto hurled one
on to the sacred precincts of the quarter-deck. It landed in one of
"the compartments of the pay-table, displacing a sovereign, that"
rolled between the staff-paymaster and the assistant-paymaster.
Both officers simultaneously stooped to recover the errant piece of
gold. The result was that their heads met with a thud in spite of the
protection afforded by their peaked caps.
"Several of the men could not conceal a grin. One broke into a laugh,"
and meeting the stern glance of the commander tried to side-track
into a painful cough.
Fortunately for the culprit the commander was inwardly affected by a
"similar complaint, for he, too, saw the humour of the business."
"""Confound you!"" shouted the staff-paymaster, removing his cap and"
"rubbing his bald head. ""Confound you, you brute! Throwing away the"
"money from the public chest!"""
"The only reply from Mephisto was another penny that, thrown with"
"for about ten minutes, then suddenly dump it back into its cradle, stare"
"at it gloomily or utter a laugh, and go out.  Sometimes, he would come up"
"when Gyp was there, and after watching her a little in silence, almost"
drag her away.
"Suffering always from the guilty consciousness of having no love for him,"
"and ever more and more from her sense that, instead of saving him she"
"was, as it were, pushing him down-hill--ironical nemesis for vanity!--Gyp"
"was ever more and more compliant to his whims, trying to make up.  But"
"this compliance, when all the time she felt further and further away, was"
straining her to breaking-point.  Hers was a nature that goes on
passively enduring till something snaps; after that--no more.
"Those months of spring and summer were like a long spell of drought, when"
"moisture gathers far away, coming nearer, nearer, till, at last, the"
deluge bursts and sweeps the garden.
XV
The tenth of July that year was as the first day of summer.  There had
"been much fine weather, but always easterly or northerly; now, after a"
"broken, rainy fortnight, the sun had come in full summer warmth with a"
"gentle breeze, drifting here and there scent of the opening lime blossom."
"In the garden, under the trees at the far end, Betty sewed at a garment,"
and the baby in her perambulator had her seventh morning sleep.  Gyp
stood before a bed of pansies and sweet peas.  How monkeyish the pansies'
"faces!  The sweet peas, too, were like tiny bright birds fastened to"
"green perches swaying with the wind.  And their little green tridents,"
"growing out from the queer, flat stems, resembled the antennae of"
"friendship,"" she answered with a smile.  ""I really wonder that I did not"
"object to her in the days long ago."""
"""Ah!""  I laughed, ""you certainly had no cause.  It is true that we have"
been good friends ever since the day when she arrived home from the
"convent-school at Bruges, a prim young miss with her hair tied up with"
"ribbon.  Thrown constantly together, as we were, I became her male"
confidant and intimate friend; hence my licence to give her counsel in
many matters and sometimes to criticise those actions of which I don't
"approve."""
"""Then if that is so, you care a little for her--just a little?  Now"
"admit it."""
"""I don't admit anything of the kind,"" I answered frankly.  ""For five"
"years we have been constantly together; and times without number, at"
"Lady Barmouth's request, I have acted as her escort here and there,"
until she looks upon me as a kind of necessary appendage who has a right
to chaff her about her flirtations and annoy her by judicious sarcasm.
"I don't entertain one single spark of love for her.  In brief, she has"
"developed into an essentially smart girl, in the true sense of the word,"
and by reason of our constant companionship knows that to attempt a
flirtation with me would result in a most dismal failure.  I accused her
"once, not long ago, of having designs upon my heart, whereupon she"
replied that to accomplish such a thing would be about as easy as to win
the affection of the bronze Neptune in the garden-fountain of the
"Embassy."""
"""You have been seen together a great deal of late?"""
"""Who told you so?"""
"Beneath was a vast, orderly checkerboard. Every alternate square was"
"covered by what seemed a jointless metal plate. The open squares,"
"plainly land under cultivation, were surrounded by gleaming fences"
that hooked each metal square with every other one of its kind as
batteries are wired in series. Over these open squares progressed
"tiny, two legged figures, for the most part following gigantic"
shapeless animals like figures out of a dream. Ahead suddenly appeared
the spires and towers of an enormous city!
"Metropolis and cultivated land! It was as unbelievable, on that raw"
"new planet, as such a sight would have been could a traveler in time"
have observed it in the midst of a dim Pleistocene panorama of young
Earth.
It was instantly apparent that the city was their destination. Rapidly
"the little ship was rushed toward it; and, realizing at last the"
"futility of its laboring, Brand cut off the atomic motor and let the"
shell drift.
"Over a group of squat square buildings their ship passed, decreasing"
speed and drifting lower with every moment. The lofty structures that
were the nucleus of the strange city loomed closer. Now they were
"soaring slowly down a wide thoroughfare; and now, at last, they"
hovered above a great open square that was thronged with figures.
Lower they dropped. Lower. And then they settled with a slight jar on
a surface made of reddish metal; and the figures rushed to surround
them.
*       *       *       *       *
"Looking out the glass panel at these figures, both Brand and Dex"
was specially put on duty for the purpose.
"(163) Wounded at Rensburg. _Entry_ (Mauser), in ninth left"
"intercostal space in posterior axillary line; _exit_, a"
transverse slit 1/2 an inch in length to left of xiphoid
"appendage. Patient was retiring when struck; he did not fall,"
"but ran for about 1,000 yards, whence he was conveyed to"
hospital. He vomited half an hour after the injury (last meal
"bread and 'bully beef,' taken two hours previously), and during"
"the evening three times again, the vomit consisting mainly 'of"
"dark thick blood.' He was put on milk diet, and not completely"
starved; on the third day a large quantity of dark clotted
"blood was passed per rectum with the stool, and this continued"
for two days.
Ten days after the injury the temperature was still rising to
"100°, and did not become normal till the fourteenth day. The"
"pulse averaged 80. The abdomen, meanwhile, moved fairly well,"
respirations 18 to 20. Some tenderness was present in the
epigastrium and towards the spleen. Resonance throughout.
"Ordinary diet was now resumed, and beyond slight epigastric"
"pain on deep inspiration, no further symptoms were observed,"
and the patient left for England at the end of the month. The
"spleen may have been traversed in this patient, as well as the"
lower margin of the right lung.
"(164*) Wounded at Enslin. _Entry_ (Mauser), 3/4 of an inch from"
"the spine, opposite the eighth intercostal space; _exit_,"
"through the seventh left costal cartilage, 1 inch from the"
median line. The patient was lying in the prone position when
"shot: he vomited blood freely, and the bowels acted three times"
"before he was seen forty hours after the accident, each motion"
"Perhaps, after all, my jealousy might have been utterly unfounded."
"Sometimes I had thought I had treated her harshly, for, truth to tell, I"
had never obtained absolute proof that this man was more than a mere
"acquaintance.  Indeed, I think it was this fact, or just a slight twinge"
"of conscience, that caused a suspicion of the old love I once bore her"
to remain within me.  It was not just to Edith--that I knew; yet
"notwithstanding the denunciations of both Kaye and Anderson, I could not"
altogether crush her from my heart.  To wholly forget the woman for whom
"one has entertained the grand passion is often most difficult,"
"sometimes, indeed, impossible of accomplishment.  Visions of some sweet"
"face with its pouting and ready lips will arise, constantly keeping the"
"past ever present, and recalling a day one would fain forget.  Thus it"
was with me--just as it has been with thousands of others.
"""No,"" I admitted truthfully and honestly at last, ""my love for Yolande"
"is perhaps not altogether dead."""
"""Then you will render me a service?"" she cried quickly.  ""Say that you"
"will--for her sake!--for the sake of the great love you once bore her!"""
"""Of what nature is this service you desire?""  I asked, determined to act"
"with caution, for the startling stories I had heard had aroused within"
me considerable suspicion.
"""I desire your silence regarding an absolute secret,"" she answered in a"
hoarse half-whisper.
"""What secret?"""
"""A secret concerning Yolande,"" she responded.  ""Will you, for her sake,"
"render us assistance, and at the same time preserve absolute secrecy as"
"to what you may see or learn here to-day?"""
"me--may the Devil take him!"""
(ANDREYEFF.)
Throughout the winter one question above all others was discussed by the
"few who took an interest in the war: ""What were the Germans going to"
"do?"" It was clear that they had been able to withdraw many divisions"
from their Eastern Front. Would they be numerically equal or superior to
the Allies on the Western Front?
"On the whole we were of opinion that, whatever happened, our positions"
"would prove impregnable, although we observed with some astonishment"
that there were no extensive trench systems or fortified places behind
our lines. I doubted whether the Germans would even attempt to break
through--I thought they would merely hold the Western Front and throw
"the Allies out of Macedonia, Palestine, and Mesopotamia."
The winter was over and the fine weather had set in. For several months
we had been working in a wood-yard and saw-mills. Our lives had become
"unspeakably monotonous, but the coming of warm days banished much of our"
dreariness. The hazy blue sky was an object of real delight. I often
contrived to slip away from my work and lean idly against a wall in the
mild sunshine. At times I was so filled with the sense of physical
"well-being, and so penetrated by the sensuous enjoyment of warmth and"
"colour, that I even forgot the war."
"At the bottom of the wood-yard was a little stream, and on the far bank"
clusters of oxlips were in bloom. Here we would lie down during the
midday interval and surrender to the charm of the spring weather. It
"seemed unnatural and almost uncanny that we should be happy, but there"
"were moments when we felt something very much like happiness. Moreover,"
"(170*) Wounded at Magersfontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), 1/2 inch to"
"the left of the second sacral spine; _exit_, immediately below"
the left anterior superior iliac spine; the patient was
"kneeling at the time, and the same bullet traversed his left"
"thigh in the lower third. When seen on the third day, the"
"lower part of the abdomen was motionless, tumid, and tender."
The bowels had been confined for three days; there had been no
"sickness, and the tongue was moist and clean. Temperature 100°,"
"pulse 90, fair strength, respirations 38. The patient had once"
"had an attack of acute appendicitis, and he himself said he was"
"sure he now had 'peritonitis,' as he had pain exactly similar"
in the belly to that he had suffered in his previous illness.
"No further signs, however, developed under an expectant"
"treatment, and he remained some two months in hospital, while"
the wound in the thigh and a third injury to the elbow-joint
were healing.
"(171) _Entry_ (Mauser), at the highest point of the left crista"
"ilii; _exit_, through the right ilium, 2 inches horizontally"
anterior to the posterior superior spine. Absolutely no
abdominal symptoms followed. The bowels were confined five
"days, and then opened by enema. The patient complained of some"
"stiffness in the lumbo-sacral region, but the right"
synchondrosis was no doubt implicated in the track.
(172) Wounded at Paardeberg (range 800 yards). _Entry_
"(Mauser), 2 inches diagonally below and to the right of the"
"umbilicus; _exit_, not discoverable. For the first two days the"
patient had to lie out with the regiment; on the fourth he was
removed to the Field hospital. During the first three days the
"patient vomited (green matter) frequently, and the belly was"
"""A lamentable display of manners, my dear.  I shall withdraw now and"
"compose a stiff note to him.  The amenities must be observed."""
"Looking as severe as a naturally jovial face would permit him, and"
"wondering a little if he had pronounced ""amenities"" right, he strode"
to the library.
The library was his Majesty's favourite apartment.  Here in the
"mornings he would discuss affairs of state with his Chancellor, or"
receive any distinguished visitors who were to come to his kingdom in
"search of adventure.  Here in the afternoon, with a copy of _What to"
"say to a Wizard_ or some such book taken at random from the shelves,"
he would give himself up to meditation.
And it was the distinguished visitors of the morning who gave him most
to think about in the afternoon.  There were at this moment no fewer
"than seven different Princes engaged upon seven different enterprises,"
"to whom, in the event of a successful conclusion, he had promised the"
hand of Hyacinth and half his kingdom.  No wonder he felt that she
needed the guiding hand of a mother.
The stiff note to Barodia was not destined to be written.  He was
"still hesitating between two different kinds of nib, when the door was"
flung open and the fateful name of the Countess Belvane was announced.
The Countess Belvane!  What can I say which will bring home to you
"that wonderful, terrible, fascinating woman? Mastered as she was by"
"overweening ambition, utterly unscrupulous in her methods of achieving"
"her purpose, none the less her adorable humanity betrayed itself in a"
passion for diary-keeping and a devotion to the simpler forms of
lyrical verse.  That she is the villain of the piece I know well; in
"the German occupation lasted, or during that time receive a penny in"
compensation for the sequestration of the property.
The notes for the hundred thousand francs therefore were carefully
concealed in Mrs. Warren's bedroom at the Hotel Impérial and Vivie
for a few months afterwards felt slightly easier in her mind as to
"the immediate future; for, as a further resource, there were also"
the jewels and plate at the bank.
"They dared hope for nothing from Villa Beau-séjour. Von Giesselin,"
"after more entreaty than Vivie cared to make, had allowed them with"
a special pass and his orderly as escort to go in a military motor
to the Villa in the month of April in order that they might bring
away the rest of their clothes and personal effects of an easily
transportable nature. But the visit was a heart-breaking
disappointment. Their reception was surly; the place was little else
than a barrack of disorderly soldiers and insolent officers. Any
search for clothes or books was a mockery. Nothing was to be found
in the chests of drawers that belonged to them; only stale food and
unnameable horrors or military equipment articles. The garden was
trampled out of recognition. There had been a beautiful vine in the
"greenhouse. It was still there, but the first foliage of spring hung"
"withered and russet coloured. The soldiers, grinning when Vivie"
"noticed this, pointed to the base of the far spreading branches. It"
"had been sawn through, and much of the glass of the greenhouse"
deliberately smashed.
"On their way back, Mrs. Warren, who was constantly in tears,"
descried waiting by the side of the road the widow of their
"farmer-neighbour, Madame Oudekens. She asked the orderly that they"
might stop and greet her. She approached. Mrs. Warren got out of the
car so that she might more privately talk to her in Flemish. Since
remembered then that before going out to look for rooms she had
transferred half the notes from their hiding-place to an inner
pocket. They were still there. But what about her luggage and her
"mother's, and the remainder of the money? In her distress she wrote"
to Gräfin von Stachelberg. Minna came over from her hospital at half
past six in the evening. By that time the doctor had given the
"necessary certificate of the cause of death, and an undertaker had"
come on the scene to make his preparations.
Minna went over to the Hotel Impérial with Vivie. Appearing in her
"Red Cross uniform, she was admitted, announced herself as the Gräfin"
"von Stachelberg, and demanded to know what justification the manager"
could offer for his extraordinary brutality towards these English
"ladies, the result of which had been the death of the elder lady."
The manager replied that inasmuch as the All Highest himself was to
"arrive that very evening to take up his abode at the Hotel Impérial,"
"the hotel premises had been requisitioned, etc., etc. He still"
refused absolutely to allow Vivie to proceed to her room and look
for her money. She might perhaps be allowed to do so when the
Emperor was gone. As to her luggage he would have it sent over to
"the tea-shop. (The money, it might be noted, she never recovered."
There were many things also missing from her mother's trunks and no
satisfaction was ever obtained.)
"So there was Vivie, one dismal, rainy November evening in 1915;"
"homeless, her mother lying dead in a room of this tea-shop, and in"
her own pocket only a matter of thirty thousand francs to provide
for her till the War was over. A thousand pounds in fluctuating
value was all that was left of a nominal twenty thousand of the year
before.
But the financial aspect of the case for the time being did not
"""It is hardly worth while to begin now,"" Beatrice observed, and this"
simple acknowledgment that the end was at hand received no
contradiction.
"Once again the silence was unbroken, save for the soft swish of the"
"fan and Mrs. Cary's heavy, irregular breathing. Yet the five women who"
in the full swing of their life had been diametrically opposed to one
"another were now united in a common sympathy. Death, far more than a"
"leveler of class, is the melting-pot into which are thrown all"
"antagonisms, all violent discords of character. The one great fact"
"overshadows everything, and the petty stumbling-blocks of daily life"
are forgotten. More than that still--it is the supreme moment in man's
existence when the innermost treasures or unsuspected hells are
"revealed beyond all denial. And in these five women, hidden in two"
"cases at least beneath a mass of meanness, selfishness and"
"indifference, there lay an unusual power of self-sacrifice and pity."
"Death was drawing near to them all, and their one thought was how to"
make his coming easier for the other. When the silence grew
"unbearable, it was Mrs. Carmichael who had the courage to break it"
with a trivial criticism respecting the manner in which Lois was
making the sandwiches.
"""You should put the butter on before you cut them,"" she said tartly,"
"""and as little as possible. I'm quite sure it has gone rancid, and"
"then George won't touch them. He is so fussy about the butter."""
Mrs. Berry looked up. The perspiration of physical fear stood on her
"cold forehead, but her roused will-power fought heroically and"
conquered.
"""And, please, would you mind making one or two without butter?"" she"
"soul, possessed him,--and the comprehension of Christ's Sacrifice was"
"no longer a mystery! Yet he was so certain that death, sudden and"
"speedy closely, awaited him that he seemed to feel it in the very"
"air,--not like a coming chill of dread, but like the soft approach of"
some holy seraph bringing benediction. It mattered little to him that
"he was actually in the very plenitude of health and strength,--that"
perhaps in all his life he had never felt such a keen delight in the
"physical perfection of his manhood as now,--death, without warning and"
"at a touch, could smite down the most vigorous, and to be so smitten,"
"he believed, was his imminent destiny. And while he lingered on the"
"bridge, fancy-perplexed between grief and joy, a small window opened in"
a quaint house that bent its bulging gables crookedly over the gleaming
"water, and a girl, holding a small lamp, looked out for a moment. Her"
"face, fresh and smiling, was fair to see against the background of"
"dense shadow,--the light she carried flashed like a star,--and leaning"
"down from the lattice she sang half-timidly, half mischievously, the"
"first two or three bars of the old song.. ""Du, du, liegst in mein"
"Herzen ... !"" ""Ah! Gute Nacht, Liebchen!"" said a man's voice below."
"""Gute Nacht! Schlafen sie wohl!"""
"A light laugh, and the window closed, ""Good-night! Sleep well!"" Love's"
"best wish!--and for some sad souls life's last hope,--a ""good-night and"
"sleep well!"" Poor tired World, for whose weary inhabitants oftentimes"
the greatest blessing is sleep! Good-night! sleep well! but the sleep
"implies waking.--waking to a morning of pleasure or sorrow,--or labor"
"that is only lightened by,--Love! Love!--love divine,--love"
"human,--and, sweetest love of all for us, as Christ has taught when"
both divine and human are mingled in one!
"Alwyn, glancing up at the clustering stars, hanging like pendent"
"fire-jewels above him, thought of this marvel-glory of Love,--this"
"eternal _à propos_. What he writes is never vague, never dark--it is"
always plausible. Everything seemingly flows of itself like a fountain.
"It always rings true as to tone, turn of phrase and accent. It has"
"almost the light harmony of Ariosto. And it is, like Ariosto, never"
"tragic, never truly heroic. It carries us away, indeed, but it is never"
itself truly enraptured.
The more artistic aspects of Erasmus's talent come out most
clearly--though they are everywhere in evidence--in those two
"recreations after more serious labour, the _Moriae Encomium_ and the"
_Colloquia_. But just those two have been of enormous importance for his
influence upon his times. For while Jerome reached tens of readers and
"the New Testament hundreds, the _Moria_ and _Colloquies_ went out to"
thousands. And their importance is heightened in that Erasmus has
nowhere else expressed himself so spontaneously.
"In each of the Colloquies, even in the first purely formulary ones,"
"there is the sketch for a comedy, a novelette or a satire. There is"
"hardly a sentence without its 'point', an expression without a vivid"
fancy. There are unrivalled niceties. The abbot of the _Abbatis et
eruditae colloquium_ is a Molière character. It should be noticed how
"well Erasmus always sustains his characters and his scenes, because he"
_sees_ them. In 'The woman in childbed' he never forgets for a moment
"that Eutrapelus is an artist. At the end of 'The game of knucklebones',"
"when the interlocutors, after having elucidated the whole nomenclature"
"of the Latin game of knuckle-bones, are going to play themselves,"
"Carolus says: 'but shut the door first, lest the cook should see us"
playing like two boys'.
"As Holbein illustrated the _Moria_, we should wish to possess the"
"_Colloquia_ with illustrations by Brueghel, so closely allied is"
Erasmus's witty clear vision of incidents to that of this great master.
Everybody understood what he hinted. Sir Robert did not care to depend
on the will of Coxon and his seceders.
"""And what about Coxon and Puttock?"" was the next question."
"""Haven't I been indiscreet enough?"""
"""Well, what are you going to do yourself?"""
"""My duty,"" answered Mr. Kilshaw, with a smile, and the throng, failing"
"to extract any more from him, did at last set about the task of getting"
home to bed in good earnest.
They could rest sooner than the man who occupied so much of their
interest. It had been a busy evening for the defeated Minister; he had
"colleagues to see, letters to write, messages to send, conferences to"
"hold. No doubt there was much to do, and yet Norburn, who watched him"
"closely, doubted whether he did not make work for himself, perhaps as a"
"means of distraction, perhaps as a device for postponing an interview"
"with his daughter. He had seen her for a minute when he came in, and"
told her he would tell her all there was to tell some time that night;
but the moment for it was slow in coming. Norburn had been struck with
"Daisy's composure. She had seen the _Evening Mail_, and, without"
"attempting to discuss the matter with him, she expressed her conviction"
that there could be nothing distressing behind the mysterious paragraph.
Norburn did not know what to say to her. He felt that in a case of this
"sort a girl's mind was a closed book to him. He had himself, on the way"
"back from the House, heard a brief account of the whole matter from the"
"Premier's lips; it seemed to him, in the light of his ideas and"
"theories, a matter of very little moment. He was of course aware how"
"widely the judgment of many would differ from his, and when his mind was"
"state of defence as is possible, since the attack of the gipsies may be"
"expected at any moment!"""
"Rollo stepped to the window to summon his company, but found them"
already assembled on the balcony. It was no time for formal
"introductions, yet, as each entered, Rollo, like a true herald,"
delivered himself of a brief statement of the position of the individual
"in the company. But when La Giralda entered, the stout waiting-maid rose"
with a shriek from the floor where she had been sitting.
"""Oh, my lady,"" she cried, ""do not trust these wicked people. They have"
come to murder us all. That woman is the very old goatherdess with whom
the Princess Isabel was so bewitched this morning! I knew some evil
"would come of such ongoings!"""
"""Hush, Susana,"" said her mistress with severity; ""when you are asked for"
"any information, be ready to give it. Till then hold your peace."""
"Which having said she turned haughtily back again to the strangers,"
without vouchsafing a glance at her husband or the trembling handmaiden.
"""I can well believe,"" she said, ""that you have come here to do us a"
"service in our present temporary difficulty, and for that, if I find you"
"of approved fidelity, you shall not fail to be rewarded. Meantime, I"
"accept your service, and I place you and the whole of your men under the"
"immediate command of his Excellency the Duke of Rianzares!"""
She turned to the tall exquisite who still continued to comb his
whiskers by the chimney-piece. Up till now he had not spoken a word.
"Rollo scarcely knew what to reply to this, and as for the Sergeant, he"
had the hardest work to keep from bursting into a loud laugh.
"corrected by him and all those divines, whom he distrusted, would watch"
him at close quarters. But it was only to be for a few months. 'I have
"removed to Louvain', he writes to the Archbishop of Canterbury, 'till I"
"shall decide which residence is best suited to old age, which is already"
knocking at the gate importunately.'
"As it turned out, he was to spend four years (1517-21) at Louvain. His"
"life was now becoming more stationary, but because of outward"
circumstances rather than of inward quiet. He kept deliberating all
"those years whether he should go to England, Germany or France, hoping"
at last to find the brilliant position which he had always coveted and
never had been able or willing to grasp.
The years 1516-18 may be called the culmination of Erasmus's career.
Applauding crowds surrounded him more and more. The minds of men were
seemingly prepared for something great to happen and they looked to
"Erasmus as the man! At Brussels, he was continually bothered with visits"
"from Spaniards, Italians and Germans who wanted to boast of their"
"interviews with him. The Spaniards, with their verbose solemnity,"
particularly bored him. Most exuberant of all were the eulogies with
which the German humanists greeted him in their letters. This had begun
"already on his first journey to Basle in 1514. 'Great Rotterdamer',"
"'ornament of Germany', 'ornament of the world' were some of the simplest"
"effusions. Town councils waited upon him, presents of wine and public"
banquets were of common occurrence. No one expresses himself so
hyperbolically as the jurist Ulrich Zasius of Freiburg. 'I am pointed
"out in public', he asserts, 'as the man who has received a letter from"
"Erasmus.' 'Thrice greatest hero, you great Jove' is a moderate"
"apostrophe for him. 'The Swiss', Zwingli writes in 1516, 'account it a"
great glory to have seen Erasmus.' 'I know and I teach nothing but
"Erasmus now,' writes Wolfgang Capito. Ulrich von Hutten and Henry"
"Glareanus both imagine themselves placed beside Erasmus, as Alcibiades"
"""I fancy,--I think,--we have met,--before! May I, . . dare I, . . ask"
"your name?"""
"Slowly she unclasped her gently folded hands; slowly, very slowly, she"
"lifted her bent head, and smiled at him! Oh, the lovely light upon her"
"face! Oh, the angel glory of those strange, sweet eyes!"
"""My name is EDRIS!""--she said, and as the pure bell-like tone of her"
"voice smote the air with its silvery sound, the mysterious music of the"
"organ and the invisible singers throbbed away,--away,--away,--into"
"softer and softer echoes, that died at last tremulously and with a"
"sigh, as of farewell, into the deepest silence."
"""EDRIS!""--In a trance of passionate awe and rapture he caught her"
"hand,--the warm, delicate hand that yielded to his strong clasp in"
"submissive tenderness,--pulsations of terror, pain, and wild joy, all"
"commingled, rushed through him,--with adoring, wistful gaze he scanned"
"every feature of that love-smiling countenance,--a countenance no"
"longer lustrous with Heaven's blinding glory, but only most maiden-like"
"and innocently fair,--dazzled, perplexed, and half afraid, he could not"
at once grasp the true comprehension of his ineffable delight! He had
no doubt of her identity--he knew her well! she was his own
"heartworshipped Angel,--but on what errand had she wandered out of"
"paradise? Had she come once more, as on the Field of Ardath, to comfort"
"him for a brief space with the beauty of her visible existence, or did"
she bring from Heaven the warrant for his death?
"""Edris!"" he said, as softly as one may murmur a prayer, ""Edris, my"
"life, my love! Speak to me again! make me sure that I am not dreaming!"
Tell me where I have failed in my sworn faith since we parted; teach me
how I must still further atone! Is this the hour appointed for my
"spirit's ransom?--has this dear and sacred hand I hold, brought me my"
And so it was that Johnson decided to pass the night in the Girl's
"canopied bed while she herself, rolled up in a blanket rug before the"
"fire, slept on the floor."
"""This beats a bed any time,"" remarked the Girl, spreading out the rug"
"smoothly; and then, reaching up for the old patchwork, silk quilt that"
"hung from the loft, she added: ""There's one thing--you don't have to"
"make it up in the mornin'."""
"""You're splendid, Girl!"" laughed Johnson. Presently, he saw her quietly"
"closet herself in the cupboard, only to emerge a few minutes later"
dressed for the night. Over her white cambric gown with its coarse lace
"trimming showing at the throat, she wore a red woollen blanket robe held"
"in at the waist by a heavy, twisted, red cord which, to the man who got"
"a glimpse of her as she crossed the room, made her prettier, even, than"
she had seemed at any time yet.
"Quietly, now, the Girl began to put her house in order. All the lights,"
"save the quaintly-shaded lamp that was suspended over the table, were"
"extinguished; that one, after many unsuccessful attempts, was turned"
down so as to give the right minimum of light which would not interfere
with her lover's sleep. Then she went over to the door to make sure that
it was bolted. Outside the wind howled and shrieked and moaned; but
inside the cabin it had never seemed more cosey and secure and peaceful
to her.
"""Now you can talk to me from your bunk an' I'll talk to you from mine,"""
"she said in a sleepy, lazy voice."
Except for a prodigious yawn which came from the Girl there was an
ominous quiet hanging over the place that chilled the man. Sudden sounds
"startled him, and he found it impossible to make any progress with his"
the lieutenant had appeared in his room with a revolver and had
threatened to shoot him unless he produced a suit of civilian
clothes. Thus coerced he had given him his eldest son's Sunday
clothes left behind when the said son went off to join the Belgian
"army. The lieutenant, grateful for the assistance, had given him as"
a present his watch and chain.
On the other hand the German non-commissioned officers insisted
their lieutenant had been made away with in the night. The farmer's
allegation that he had deserted (as in fact he had) only enhanced
his crime. The finding of the court after a very summary trial was
"""guilty,"" and despite the frantic appeals of the wife, reinforced"
"later on by Mrs. Warren, the farmer had been taken out and shot."
The evening meal consequently was one of strained relations. Colonel
von Giesselin came to supper punctually and was very spruce in
appearance. But he was gravely polite and uncommunicative. And after
dessert the two ladies asked permission to retire. They lay long
"awake afterwards, debating in whispers what terror might be in store"
for them. Mrs. Warren cried a good deal and lamented futilely her
"indolent languor of a few days previously. _Why_ had she not, while"
"there was yet time, cleared out of Brussels, gone to Holland, and"
"thence regained England with Vivie, and from England the south of"
"France? Vivie, more stoical, pointed out it was no use crying over"
"lost opportunities. Here they were, and they must sharpen their wits"
to get away at the first opportunity. Perhaps the American Consul
might help them?
"The next morning, however, their guest, who had insensibly turned"
"host, told Vivie the tram service to Brussels, like the train"
"service, was suspended indefinitely, and that he feared they must"
resign themselves to staying where they were. Under his protection
afford the surest highways and land abutting them brings higher prices.

"David, the largest interior town of Panama, is the central point of the"
"cattle industry. All around it are woods, or jungles, plentifully"
"interspersed with broad prairies, or llanos, covered with grass, and on"
which no trees grow save here and there a wild fig or a ceibo. Cattle
"graze on the llanos, sleek reddish beasts with spreading horns like our"
Texas cattle. There are no huge herds as on our western ranges. Droves
of from ten to twenty are about the average among the small owners who
rely on the public range for subsistence. The grass is not sufficiently
"nutritious to bring the cattle up to market form, so the small owners"
"sell to the owners of big ranches who maintain potreros, or fattening"
ground sown with better grasses. A range fed steer will fetch $15 to
"$18, and after six or eight months on the potrero it will bring $30 to"
$35 from the cattle shipper at David. Since the cost of feeding a beeve
"for that period is only about one dollar, and as the demand is fairly"
steady the profit of the ranchman is a good one. But like all other
"industries in Panama, this one is pursued in only a retail way. The"
market is great enough to enrich ranchmen who would go into the business
"on a large scale, but for some reason none do."
[Illustration: BOLIVAR PARK AT BOCAS DEL TORO]
Passing from llano to llano the road cuts through the forest which
"towers dense and impenetrable on either side, broken only here and"
there by small clearings made by some native with the indispensable
machete. These in the main are less than four acres. The average
"softly crooning in an unknown tongue over the poor dead babe, she"
"lovingly closed its eyes, and taking a sheet from a wall-press that"
"stood partially open, she began to enwrap the little girl in its crisp"
"white folds. The Spaniards are like the Scottish folk in this, that they"
have universally stores of the best and finest linen.
La Giralda was about to lay the wooden puppet aside as a thing of little
"worth, but something in the clutch of the small dead hands touched and"
troubled her. She altered her intention.
"""No, you shall not be parted!"" she said, ""and if there be a resurrection"
"as the priests prate of--why, you shall e'en wake with the doll in your"
"arms!"""
"So the pair, in death not divided, were wrapt up together, and the gipsy"
woman prepared to carry her light burden afield. But before doing so she
"went to the bed. It was an ancient woman who lay thereon, clutching the"
"bed-clothes, and drawn together with the last agony. La Giralda gazed at"
her a moment.
"""You I cannot carry--it is impossible,"" she muttered; ""you must take"
"your chance--even as I, if so be that the plague comes to me from this"
"innocent!"""
"Nevertheless, she cast another coverlet over the dead woman's face, and"
"went down the broad stairs of red brick, carrying her burden like a"
"precious thing. La Giralda might be no good Catholic, no fervent"
"Protestant, but I doubt not the First Martyr of the faith, the Preacher"
"of the Mount, would have admitted her to be a very fair Christian. On"
the whole I cannot think her chances in the life to come inferior to
"those of the astute Don Baltasar Varela, Prior of the Abbey of"
"Montblanch, or those of many a shining light of orthodoxy in a world"
"your aeroplanes, a rising against us in the Marolles quarter--"" said"
"very plainly what she thought of Edith Cavell's execution. ""It makes"
me think of Talleyrand--was it not?--who said 'It is a blunder;
"worse than a crime' ... these terrible old generals, they know"
"nothing of the world outside Germany."" As to her cousin, Gottlieb"
"von Giesselin--""Really dear, if in this time of horrors one _dare_"
"laugh at anything, I feel--oh it is too funny, but also, too"
"'schokking,' as we suppose all English women say. Yet of course I am"
"sad about him, because he is a good, kind man, and I know his wife"
"will be very very unhappy when she hears--And it means he will die,"
"for certain. He must risk his life to--to--regain his position, and"
"he will be shot before Verdun in one of those dreadful assaults."""
"Then she told Vivie where she might find rooms, where at any rate"
"she could use her name as a reference. Also: ""Stay away at present"
"and look after your mother. When she is quite comfortably settled,"
come back and work with me--here--it is at any rate the only way in
"which you can see and help your countrymen."""
One day in November when their notice at the hotel was nearly
"expired, Vivie proposed an expedition to her mother. They would walk"
slowly--because Mrs. Warren now got easily out of breath--up to the
Jardin Bontanique; Vivie would leave her there in the Palm House. It
was warm; it was little frequented; there were seats and the
Belgians in charge knew Mrs. Warren of old time. Vivie would then go
on along the inner Boulevards by tram and look at some rooms
recommended by Minna von Stachelberg in the Quartier St. Gilles.
Mrs. Warren did as she was told. Vivie left her seated in one of the
"long series of glass houses overlooking Brussels from a terrace,"
"wherein are assembled many glories of the tropics: palms, dracaenas,"
"yuccas, aloes, tree-ferns, cycads, screw-pines, and bananas:"
promising to be back in an hour's time.
"nonchalantly. ""And--we're in lots of time."""
"Mr. Jobling looked cross. ""Five minutes more would have lost you the"
"train,"" he remarked somewhat sourly. ""And where would Captain Dove and I"
"have been then!"""
"As it was, however, they found Captain Dove in his berth, sound asleep,"
"although still fully dressed. And, as Slyne ushered Sallie into the"
"double compartment reserved for her and Ambrizette, ""Don't go to bed"
"just yet,"" he begged. ""I want to show you something by and by. You'll"
"have lots of time for a long sleep before we arrive."""
"""All right, Jasper,"" she agreed. ""I'll wait up till you come for me."""
"When he at length knocked at her door again, Mr. Jobling was still with"
her. She came out between them into the narrow corridor. Slyne rubbed
clear one steamy window to let her see the wintry landscape through
which they were travelling at express speed. And Sallie looked out
"delighted, at the sleeping English countryside as its broad grass-lands"
"and bare brown acres, coverts and coppices, hedgerows and lanes, with"
"here and there a grange or a group of cottages, all still and silent,"
"flashed into sight and so disappeared; until, overlooking them all from"
"a knoll on the near bank of a broad, winding river, there loomed up a"
"most magnificent mansion, embedded, in lordly seclusion, among many"
"gnarled and age-old oaks, with gardens terrace on terrace about it, tall"
"fountains among their empty flower-beds, a moss-grown sun-dial at the"
"edge of a quiet, silver lake."
"The moon was shining full on its innumerable windows, so that it seemed"
"to be lighted up from within, although, in reality, all were shuttered"
"and dark. Aloof and very stately it stood on that windless night, an"
"empty palace which came and went in a few moments, wing after wing, with"
and flung into the corner. Articles of wearing apparel were scattered
"about, while over everything were sifted scraps of white paper in"
seemingly endless quantity. It was these torn scraps that roused Bob’s
"indignation. He seemed to know intuitively, without the evidence of the"
"limp, empty book covers here and there, that the foreman had taken time"
to tear into shreds every record and paper connected with the drive
"which he possessed. Time books, scalers’ measurements--everything--had"
been destroyed practically beyond the possibility of reconstruction.
There would be no accurate way now by which the firm could figure their
profits or costs or labor charges. The very paying of the drive crew
would be a matter of guesswork.
“Jove!” exclaimed Bainbridge through his clenched teeth. “I didn’t know
a man could be so rotten!”
"He stared at the wreck for a minute longer, and then turned over with"
"his foot the square, wooden box which lay upset in the middle of the"
mess. Apparently it had served Schaeffer as a receptacle for these same
"records. It was quite empty, but underneath lay something which brought"
"a thoughtful, questioning expression into the searcher’s face, and made"
him stoop to pick it up.
"“Thirty-eight caliber,” he murmured, staring at the freshly opened"
pasteboard box which had contained fifty cartridges. “Hum!”
"Presently he let it drop again. He did not move for a space, but stood"
"staring at the ground with that same odd, thoughtful pucker in his"
forehead.
"There was nothing surprising in the fact of Schaeffer’s being armed,"
Neither was it strange for a man in the riverman’s position to carry off
his ammunition loose instead of in the box. That was not the point. It
saluted and stood at attention. There was a moment's silence in the
"room, but before Rollo had time to speak the Queen-Regent recovered her"
self-possession. The daughter of the Bourbons stood erect. Her long hair
streamed in dark glossy waves over her shoulders. Her bosom heaved
visibly under the thin pink wrapper. Anger struggled with fear in her
eyes. Verily Maria Cristina of Naples had plenty of courage.
"""Who are you,"" she cried, ""that dare thus to break in upon the privacy"
"of the Regent Queen of Spain? Duke, call the guard!"""
But her husband only shrugged his shoulders and continued to gaze upon
the pair of intruders with a calm exterior.
"""Your Majesty,"" said Rollo, courteously, naturally resuming the"
leadership when anything requiring contact with gentlefolk came in the
"way, ""I am here to inform you that you are in great danger--greater than"
"I can for the moment make clear to you. The palace is, as I understand,"
absolutely without defence--the town is in the same position. It is
within our knowledge that a band of two hundred gipsies are on the march
"to attack you this night in order to plunder the château, and put to"
"death every soul within its walls. We have come, therefore, together"
"with our companions outside, to offer our best services in your"
"Majesty's defence!"""
"""But,"" cried the Queen-Regent, ""all this may very well be, but you have"
"not yet told me who you are and what you are doing here!"""
"""For myself,"" answered Rollo, ""I am a Scottish gentleman, trained from"
my youth to the profession of arms. Those who wait without are for the
"present comrades and companions, whom, with your Majesty's permission, I"
"shall bid to enter. For to be plain, every moment is of the utmost"
"importance, that we may lose no time in putting the château into such a"
"temperature normal, pulse 72, respirations 24, tongue moist,"
bowels confined. Rigidity of abdominal wall and deficient
"mobility of nearly whole right half of belly, the whole lower"
half of which moves little with respiration. No track palpable
"in abdominal parietes. No dulness, no distension. The"
temperature rose to 99.5° at night. On the fourth day the
"bowels acted freely, the pulse fell to 60, the respirations"
"were 24, and the temperature normal."
Tenderness and rigidity persisted in the right flank to the end
"of a week, after which time no further signs persisted."
(175*) Wounded at Modder River while lying on right side. Range
"500 yards. Walked 400 yards after injury. _Entry_ (Mauser), at"
the junction of the posterior and middle thirds of the right
"iliac crest; _exit_, 3 inches to right of and 1/2 inch below"
the level of the umbilicus. The injury was followed by no signs
of intra-abdominal lesion; on the third day the temperature was
"normal, pulse 80, and the tongue clean and moist. Some soreness"
"at times and tenderness on pressure were complained of, but the"
man was discharged well at the end of one month.
(176*) Wounded while doubling in retirement at Modder River.
"_Entry_ (Mauser), immediately above the junction of the"
"posterior and middle thirds of the left iliac crest; _exit_, 1"
"inch below costal margin (eighth rib), 3 inches to the right of"
"the median line. The bullet was lying in the anterior wound,"
whence it was removed by the orderly who applied the first
dressing on the field. The patient remained on the field seven
"and a half hours, and when brought into hospital at once"
"commenced to vomit. The ejected matter, at first green in"
"colour, during the next forty-eight hours changed to a dirty"
"But a moment later his superiority turned to consternation, and he"
was burying his head in the bowels of the car.
After a moment's inspection he showed a face of such utter dismay
that it would have been comical had not the situation been so serious.
"""Great Scott, sir! I must have left the petrol tap turned on, and the"
"tank is nearly empty."""
"Here, I'm afraid, my language was violent, and it was some minutes"
before Allan was able to ascertain exactly how much petrol we had
left. His calculations established the fact that we had lost some
fourteen gallons. This meant that we should have to walk the greater
part of the last two hundred miles of our journey. A pleasant
"prospect in that forbidding country. But orders were to go on, and go"
on we did.
"That day we made good time, and before evening had done the ninety"
"miles set as a day's march. But, as we had lost so much ground the"
"previous day, I determined to go on as long as Allan could stick at"
"the driving wheel, and we went on--to a post called Yadgar."
"I should explain that in this barren, townless, roadless district"
"there are occasional small rest-houses, very modest types of Dâk"
"bungalows, established by the Indian Government for the benefit of"
"travellers, or soldiers on their way to frontier duty. They are quite"
"bare except for a camp bed or two, a tub, a table, a few chairs and a"
"wash-hand basin, with a _chokidar_, or keeper, in charge."
"Such a rest-house we found at Yadgar, and being not only very tired"
"and dusty, but filthily dirty, as the result of our struggles with"
"the car, we pulled up to try and get a superficial wash."
rotated the polarizing window panes until the room slowly filled with a
"muted daylight. Then, still flat on his back, he turned his head until"
he could look at the remarkably beautiful blonde girl asleep beside him.

"Remembering last night, he felt a pang of exasperation, which he"
instantly quelled by taking his mind to a higher and dispassionate
level from which he could look down on the girl and even himself as
"quaint, clumsy animals. Still, he grumbled silently, Caddy might have"
had enough consideration to clear out before he awoke. He wondered
if he shouldn't have used his hypnotic control of the girl to smooth
"their relationship last night, and for a moment the word that would"
"send her into deep trance trembled on the tip of his tongue. But no,"
that special power of his over her was reserved for far more important
purposes.
Pumping dynamic tension into his 20-year-old muscles and confidence
"into his 60-year-old mind, the 40-year-old Thinker rose from bed."
No covers had to be thrown off; the nuclear heating unit made them
"unnecessary. He stepped into his clothing--the severe tunic, tights and"
sockassins of the modern business man. Next he glanced at the message
"tape beside his phone, washed down with ginger ale a vita-amino-enzyme"
"tablet, and walked to the window. There, gazing along the rows of newly"
"planted mutant oaks lining Decontamination Avenue, his smooth face"
broke into a smile.
"It had come to him, the next big move in the intricate game making"
"up his life--and mankind's. Come to him during sleep, as so many of"
"his best decisions did, because he regularly employed the time-saving"
"technique of somno-thought, which could function at the same time as"
somno-learning.
"manners, tasteful in dress, speaking English marvellously well,"
"highly accomplished in music or with some other art, advocates of"
the enfranchisement of women. The War came just too soon. Had Heaven
"struck down that epilept Emperor and a few of his ministers, had"
time been given for the New German Woman to assert herself in
"politics, there would have been no invasion of Belgium, no"
maltreatment of Servia. Germany would have ranged herself with the
Western powers and Western culture.
Minna von Stachelberg read her cousin's note and received the worn
"and anxious-looking Vivie like a sister ... like a comrade, she"
"said, in the War for the Vote ... ""which we will resume, my dear, as"
"soon as this dreadful Man's war is over, only we won't fight with"
"the same weapons."""
"But though kind, she was not gushing and she soon told Vivie that in"
nursing she was a novice and had much to learn. She introduced her
"to the German and Belgian surgeons, and then put her to a series of"
entirely menial tasks from which she was to work her way up by
"degrees. But if any English soldier were there and wanted sympathy,"
she should be called in to his ward ... From that interview Vivie
returned almost happy.
In the hot summer months she would sometimes be allowed to accompany
"Red Cross surgeons and nurses to the station, when convoys of"
"wounded were expected, if there was likelihood that British soldiers"
would be amongst them. These would cheer up at the sound of her
pleasant voice speaking their tongue. Yet she would witness on such
occasions incongruous incidents of German brutality. Once there came
"out of the train an English and a French soldier, great friends"
evidently. They were only slightly wounded and the English soldier
stretched his limbs cautiously to relieve himself of cramp. At that
"Usually, however, the peasants of the South have left off the costume."
"Usually it is the invisible soldiers' grey-green cloth, the Italian"
"khaki. Wherever you go, wherever you be, you see this khaki, this"
"grey-green war-clothing. How many millions of yards of the thick,"
"excellent, but hateful material the Italian government must have"
"provided I don't know: but enough to cover Italy with a felt carpet, I"
should think. It is everywhere. It cases the tiny children in stiff and
"neutral frocks and coats, it covers their extinguished fathers, and"
sometimes it even encloses the women in its warmth. It is symbolic of
"the universal grey mist that has come over men, the extinguishing of all"
"bright individuality, the blotting out of all wild singleness. Oh"
democracy! Oh khaki democracy!
*       *       *       *       *
This is very different from Italian landscape. Italy is almost always
"dramatic, and perhaps invariably romantic. There is drama in the plains"
"of Lombardy, and romance in the Venetian lagoons, and sheer scenic"
excitement in nearly all the hilly parts of the peninsula. Perhaps it is
the natural floridity of lime-stone formations. But Italian landscape is
"really eighteenth-century landscape, to be represented in that"
romantic-classic manner which makes everything rather marvelous and very
"topical: aqueducts, and ruins upon sugar-loaf mountains, and craggy"
ravines and Wilhelm Meister water-falls: all up and down.
"Sardinia is another thing. Much wider, much more ordinary, not"
"up-and-down at all, but running away into the distance. Unremarkable"
"ridges of moor-like hills running away, perhaps to a bunch of dramatic"
"peaks on the southwest. This gives a sense of space, which is so lacking"
"in Italy. Lovely space about one, and traveling distances--nothing"
"finished, nothing final. It is like liberty itself, after the peaky"
"brown. Meanwhile, the abdomen was somewhat painful. When seen"
on the third day he had ceased to vomit for three hours. The
"face was slightly anxious, and the patient lay on the ground"
"with the lower extremities extended. Temperature 99°, pulse 72,"
"fair strength. Respirations 32, shallow. Tongue moist, lightly"
"furred, bowels not open for four days. He slept fairly last"
"night. Abdomen soft, moving well with respiration, no"
"distension, slight tenderness below and to the right of the"
"umbilicus, and local dulness in right flank."
"The next day the pulse fell to 60 and the bowels acted, but"
there was no change in the local condition. The man looked
"somewhat ill until the end of a week, but was then sent to the"
"Base, and at the expiration of a month was sent home well."
(177*) Wounded at Modder River. Two apertures of _entry_
(Mauser); (_a_) below cartilage of eighth rib in left nipple
line; (_b_) 2 inches below and 4-1/2 inches to the left of the
"median line. No exit wound discovered, and no track could be"
"palpated between the two openings, which were both circular and"
depressed. When seen on fourth day there was tenderness in the
"lower half of the abdomen, and the left thigh was held in a"
"flexed position. Respirations 20, respiratory movement confined"
"to upper half of abdominal wall. Pulse 70, temperature 99°."
"Tongue moist, covered with white fur; bowels confined since the"
accident; no sickness. The patient remained under observation
"thirteen days, during which time pain and difficulty in"
"movement of the left thigh persisted, also slight tenderness in"
the lower part of the abdomen; but at the end of a month he was
"sent to England well, but unfit to take further part in the"
"campaign. I thought the bullet might be in the left psoas, but"
it was not localised.
"There is a song well known to all the Burmese, the words of which are"
"taken from the sacred writings. It is called the story of Ma Pa Da, and"
"it was first told to me by a Burmese monk, long ago, when I was away on"
the frontier.
It runs like this:
"In the time of the Buddha, in the city of Thawatti, there was a certain"
"rich man, a merchant, who had many slaves. Slaves in those days, and,"
"indeed, generally throughout the East, were held very differently to"
"slaves in Europe. They were part of the family, and were not saleable"
"without good reason, and there was a law applicable to them. They were"
"not _hors de la loi_, like the slaves of which we have conception. There"
"are many cases quoted of sisters being slaves to sisters, and of"
"brothers to brothers, quoted not for the purpose of saying that this"
"was an uncommon occurrence, but merely of showing points of law in such"
cases.
"One day in the market the merchant bought another slave, a young man,"
"handsome and well mannered, and took him to his house, and kept him"
there with his family and the other slaves. The young man was earnest
"and careful in his work, and the merchant approved of him, and his"
"fellow-slaves liked him. But Ma Pa Da, the merchant's daughter, fell in"
"love with him. The slave was much troubled at this, and he did his best"
"to avoid her; but he was a slave and under orders, and what could he do?"
"When she would come to him secretly and make love to him, and say, 'Let"
"us flee together, for we love each other,' he would refuse, saying that"
"he was a slave, and the merchant would be very angry. He said he could"
"not do such a thing. And yet when the girl said, 'Let us flee, for we"
"love each other,' he knew that it was true, and that he loved her as she"
loved him; and it was only his honour to his master that held him from
"be of Orphic origin. They were buried with the dead, and for this"
reason were more outspoken in their references to the mystic doctrines
than was permissible in epitaphs exposed to the vulgar gaze. The most
"complete of these tablets is one which was found near Sybaris, and,"
"with the exception of the last sentence of all, the inscription is in"
"hexameter verse. Miss Harrison, to whose work I am wholly indebted for"
"this valuable evidence, translates as follows[1505]:"
"‘Out of the pure I come, Pure Queen of Them Below,"
Eukles and Eubouleus and the other Gods immortal.
"For I also avow me that I am of your blessed race,"
But Fate laid me low and the other Gods immortal
... starflung thunderbolt.
I have flown out of the sorrowful weary Wheel.
I have passed with eager feet to the Circle desired.
"I have sunk beneath the bosom of Despoina, Queen of the Underworld."
I have passed with eager feet from the Circle desired.
"Happy and Blessed One, thou shalt be God instead of mortal."
A kid I have fallen into milk.’
The gist of the document which the dead man takes with him is then
briefly this. He claims to have been pure originally and of the same
"race as his gods; but as a man he was mortal and exposed to death,"
and in this respect differed from his gods. He states however that he
has performed certain ritual acts which entitle him to be re-admitted
to the pure fellowship of the gods now that death is passed. And the
"answer comes, ‘Thou shalt be God instead of mortal.’"
Now here I wish to consider one only of these ritual acts--that one of
which the meaning is clearest--Δεσποίνας δ’ ὑπὸ κόλπον ἔδυν χθονίας
"βασιλείας, which means, if I may give my own rendering, ‘I was admitted"
"to the embrace of Despoina, Queen of the under-world.’ The phrase"
"""Thanks for the compliment, Breck, but I'm your computer for this trip,"
"anyway. Newton, the good old egg, knows what you fellows are up against"
"and is going to do something about it, if he has to lick all the rest of"
the directors to do it. He knew that I was loose for a couple of weeks
and asked me to come along this trip to see what I could see. I'm to
check the observatory data--they don't know I'm aboard--take the peaks
"and valleys off your acceleration curve, if possible, and report to"
Newton just what I find out and what I think should be done about it.
"How early am I?"" While the newcomer was talking, he had stripped the"
covers from a precise scale model of the solar system and from a large
and complicated calculating machine and had set to work without a wasted
motion or instant--scaling off upon the model the positions of the
various check-stations and setting up long and involved integrals and
equations upon the calculator.
"The older man studied the broad back of the younger, bent over his"
"computations, and a tender, almost fatherly smile came over his careworn"
face as he replied:
"""Early? You? Just like you always were--plus fifteen seconds on the"
"deadline. The final dope is due right now."" He plugged the automatic"
"recorder and speaker into a circuit marked ""Observatory,"" waited until"
"a tiny light above the plug flashed green, and spoke."
"""IPV _Arcturus_; Breckenridge, Chief Pilot; trip number forty-three"
"twenty-nine. Ready for final supplementary route and flight data, Tellus"
"to Mars."""
"""Meteoric swarms still too numerous for safe travel along the scheduled"
"route,"" came promptly from the speaker. ""You must stay further away from"
the plane of the ecliptic. The ether will be clear for you along route
Abyedok was always the first to propose dreadful plans to effect the
"desired end, but the Captain, always first in every other argument, did"
"not join in this one.  They also spoke much and impudently about women,"
"but the teacher always defended them, and sometimes was very angry when"
"they went so far as to pass the limits of decency.  They all, as a"
"rule, gave in to him, because they did not look upon him as a common"
"person, and also because they wished to borrow from him on Saturdays"
the money which he had earned during the week.  He had many privileges.
"They never beat him, for instance, on these occasions when the"
conversation ended in a free fight.  He had the right to bring women
"into the dosshouse; a privilege accorded to no one else, as the Captain"
had previously warned them.
"""No bringing of women to my house,"" he had said. ""Women, merchants and"
"philosophers, these are the three causes of my ruin.  I will horsewhip"
anyone bringing in women.  I will horsewhip the woman also....  And as
"to the philosopher I'll knock his head off for him.""  And"
"notwithstanding his age he could have knocked anyone's head off, for he"
"possessed wonderful strength.  Besides that, whenever he fought or"
"quarrelled, he was assisted by Martyanoff, who was accustomed during a"
"general fight to stand silently and sadly back to back with Kuvalda,"
when he became an all-destroying and impregnable engine of war.  Once
"when Simtsoff was drunk, he rushed at the teacher for no reason"
"whatever, and getting hold of his head tore out a bunch of hair."
"Kuvalda, with one stroke of his fist in the other's chest sent him"
"spinning, and he fell to the ground.  He was unconscious for almost"
"half-an-hour, and when he came to himself, Kuvalda compelled him to eat"
"the hair he had torn from the teacher's head. He ate it, preferring"
this to being beaten to death.
"Besides reading newspapers, fighting and indulging in general"
"conversation, they amused themselves by playing cards.  They played"
the creative energy.... The great artist works _in_ and _through_ and
_from_ moral ideas; his works are indirectly a criticism of life. He
"is moral without having a moral. The moment a moral obtrudes itself,"
that moment he begins to fall from grace as an artist.... The great
distinction of Art is that it aims to see life steadily and to see it
whole.... It affords the one point of view whence the world appears
harmonious and complete.”
"It would seem, then, from this passage, that it is of _moral_"
importance to put things dramatically.
In Froebel's “Mother Play” he demonstrates the educational value of
"stories, emphasising that their highest use consists in their ability"
"to enable the child, through _suggestion_, to form a pure and noble"
idea of what a man may be or do. The sensitiveness of a child's mind
"is offended if the moral is forced upon him, but if he absorbs it"
"unconsciously, he has received its influence for all time."
To me the idea of pointing out the moral of the story has always seemed
as futile as tying a flower on to a stalk instead of letting the flower
"_grow out_ of the stalk, as Nature intended. In the first case, the"
"flower, showy and bright for the moment, soon fades away. In the second"
"instance, it develops slowly, coming to perfection in fulness of time"
because of the life within.
"X.--Lastly, the element to avoid is _that which rouses emotions which"
cannot be translated into action_.
"Mr. Earl Barnes, to whom all teachers owe a debt of gratitude for the"
"inspiration of his education views, insists strongly on this point."
"The sole effect of such stories is to produce a form of hysteria,"
"fortunately short-lived, but a waste of force which might be directed"
voices. It seemed to him that he recognised Nick's voice. But whoever it
"was, he spoke in whispers, and though the wounded man strove to hear, he"
was unsuccessful.
After a while he heard the door close and then the tension was somewhat
"relaxed, for he knew that she was keeping his presence in her cabin a"
secret with all the wiles of a clever and loving woman. And more and
more he determined to gain an honoured place for her in some
"community--an honoured place for himself and her. Vague, very vague, of"
"course, were the new purposes and plans that had so suddenly sprang up"
"because of her influence, but the desire to lead a clean life had"
"touched his heart, and since his old calling had never been pleasing to"
"him, he did not for a moment doubt his ability to succeed."
"The morning was half gone when the Girl returned to her patient. Then,"
"in tones that did her best to make her appear free from anxiety, she"
"told him that it was the barkeeper, as he had surmised, with whom she"
had been talking and that she had been obliged to take him into her
"confidence. The man made no comment, for the situation necessarily was"
"in her hands, and he felt that she could be relied upon not to make any"
"mistake. Four people, he was told, knew of his presence in the cabin. So"
"far as Rance was concerned she had absolute faith in his honour, gambler"
though he was; there was nothing that Nick would not do for her; and as
"for the Indians, the secret was sure to be kept by them, unless"
"Jackrabbit got hold of some whisky--a contingency not at all likely, for"
"Nick had promised to see to that. In fact, all could be trusted to be as"
silent as the grave.
"The invalid had listened intently; nevertheless, he sighed:"
"""It's hard to lie here. I don't want to be caught _now_."""
Then suddenly the affair altered its complexion.
The oncoming tug was barely twice its length from the scow when Boyd
saw Big George cease his violent antics and level a revolver directly
at the wheel-house of the opposing craft. Two puffs of smoke issued
"from weapon, then out from the glass-encased structure the steersman"
"plunged, scrambled down the deck and into the shelter of the house."
"Instantly the bow of the tug swung off, and she came on sidewise,"
"striking Balt's scow a glancing blow, the sound of which rose above the"
"shouts, while its force threw the big fellow and his companions to"
their knees and shattered the glass in the pilot-house windows. The
"boats behind fouled each other, then drifted down upon the scow, and"
"the tide, seizing the whole flotilla, began to spin it slowly. Rushing"
"to the ladder, Emerson leaped into another launch which fortunately was"
"at hand, and the next instant as the little craft sped out from the"
"side of _The Bedford Castle_, he saw that a fight was in progress on"
"the lighter. It was over quickly, and before he reached the scene the"
"current had drifted the tows apart. George, it seemed, had boarded the"
"tug, dragged the captain off, and beaten him half insensible before the"
man's companions had come to his rescue.
"""Is the scow damaged?"" Emerson cried, as he came alongside."
"""She's leaking, but I guess we can make it,"" George reassured him."
"They directed the second launch to make fast, and, towed by both tugs,"
they succeeded in beaching their cargo a mile below the landing.
"""We'll calk her at low tide,"" George declared, well satisfied at this"
outcome of the misadventure. Then he fell to reviling the men who had
caused it.
"But what wonder is it that little Concha, in her passionate Spanish"
"fashion understanding but one way of love, and being little interested"
"in brothers, felt the tears come to her eyes as Rollo's step waxed"
"fainter in the distance, and said over and over to herself with smiling"
"pleasure, ""He loves me--he loves me! Oh, if only my mother had lived, I"
might have been worthier of him. Then I would not have played with men's
"hearts for amusement to myself, as alas, I have too often done. God"
"forgive me, there was no harm, indeed. But--but--I am not worthy of"
"him--I know I am not!"""
So Rollo's hasty kiss on the dark balcony was provocative of a healthy
self-reproach on both sides--which at least was so much to the good.
Concha peered out into the darkness towards the south where a few stars
were blinking sleepily through the ground-mist. She could dimly discern
"the outline of the town lying piled beneath her, without a light,"
"without a sound, without a sign of life. From beyond the hills came a"
"weird booming as of a distant cannonade. But Concha, the careless maiden"
"who had grown into a woman in an hour, did not think of these things."
"For to the Spanish girl, whose heart is touched to the core, there is"
"but one subject worthy of thought. Wars, battles, sieges, the distresses"
"of queens, the danger of royal princesses--all are as nothing, because"
her lips have been kissed.
"""All the same,"" she muttered to herself, ""he ought not have done it--and"
"when I have a little recovered I will tell him so!"""
"But at that moment, poised upon the topmost spike of the great gate in"
"front of her, she saw the silhouette of a man. He was climbing upwards,"
"with his hand on the cross-bar of the railing, and cautiously"
"insinuating a leg over the barrier, feeling meanwhile gingerly for a"
foothold on the palace side.
"prince of cooks. Yet who, by the wildest stretch of fancy, could have"
contemplated tight places or dangers as the trim yacht rode peacefully
at anchor an eighth of a mile off our dock at smiling Miami? To every
man aboard such things as death and the shedding of blood had ceased
"with the armistice, and Gates would have taken his oath, were it asked"
"of him, that our course pointed only toward laughing waters, blue skies,"
and emerald shore-lines.
Early next morning we were under way when Tommy pounded on my stateroom
"door, challenging me to a dip overboard. There was a glorious joy in his"
"voice, as far reaching as reveille, that found response in the cockles"
"of my heart. Gates, never happier than when standing beneath stretched"
"canvas, hove-to as he saw us dash stark naked up the companionway stairs"
"and clear the rail head-first, but he laid by only while we had our"
splash and continued the course southward the moment our hands grasped
the gangway.
"""We're cruising, not swimming,"" he said bluntly, as we reached the deck."
"""But I'll say this,"" he called after us, ""you're both in about as fine"
"condition as men get to be. I'll give _that_ to the Army!"" Which was"
"true, except for the fact that I might have been pronounced overtrained."
"Tommy and I were as hard as nails, our skin glowed like satin--but,"
"better than this, his spirit was quick with the love of living, charged"
with a contagion that had already begun to touch my own.
Half an hour later he mumbled through a crumbling biscuit:
"""If Pete ever cooked better grub than this it was in a previous"
"incarnation!"""
"""Man achieves his greatest triumph but once in life,"" I admitted. ""It's"
"self-evident."""
you a thousand times you keep no watch? I have a great mind to stand
half a dozen of you up against that wall. Escaped with my entire command
"about the rogue's home-nest! Well, set a torch to it and see if he is"
"lurking anywhere about the crevices like a centipede in a crack!"""
Cabrera felt that he had wasted a great deal of time on a fine morning
"without shooting somebody, and it would certainly have gone ill with Don"
Luis or his brother if either of them had been compelled by the flames
to issue forth from the burning mill-house of Sarria.
But they were not there. The cur dogs of the village and a few
half-starved mongrels that followed the troops had great sport worrying
the rats which darted continually from the burning granaries. But of the
"more important human rats, no sign."
"All the inhabitants of the village were there likewise, held back from"
plundering by the bayonets of the Carlist troops. They stood recounting
"to each other, wistfully, the stores of clothes, the silk curtains, the"
"uncut pieces of broadcloth, the household linen, the great eight-day"
clocks in their gilt ormolu cases. Every woman had something to add to
the catalogue. Every householder felt keenly the injustice of
permitting so much wealth to be given to the crackling flames.
"""Yes, it was very well,"" they said; ""doubtless the Fernandez family were"
"vermin to be burned up--smoked out. But they possessed much good gear,"
the gathering of many years. These things have committed no treason
against either Don Carlos or the Regent Cristina. Why then are we not
permitted to enter and remove the valuables? It is monstrous. We will
"represent the matter to General Cabrera--to Don Carlos himself!"""
"But one glance at the former, as he sat his horse, nervously twisting"
"the reins and watching the destruction from under his black brows, made"
"Painted red, as if with blood, it looked like a cruel machine which,"
"though not working, opened a row of deep, hungry, gaping jaws, as if"
ready to devour and swallow anything.  The grey wooden eating-house of
"Vaviloff, with its bent roof covered with patches, leaned against one"
"of the brick walls of the factory, and seemed as if it were some large"
form of parasite clinging to it.  The Captain was thinking that they
would very soon be making new houses to replace the old building.
"""They will destroy the dosshouse even,"" he reflected.  ""It will be"
"necessary to look out for another, but such a cheap one is not to be"
found.  It seems a great pity to have to leave a place to which one is
"accustomed, though it will be necessary to go, simply because some"
"merchant or other thinks of manufacturing candles and soap.""  And the"
Captain felt that if he could only make the life of such an enemy
"miserable, even temporarily, oh! with what pleasure he would do it!"
"Yesterday, Ivan Andreyevitch Petunikoff was in the dosshouse yard with"
his son and an architect.  They measured the yard and put small wooden
"sticks in various places, which, after the exit of Petunikoff and at"
"the order of the Captain, Meteor took out and threw away.  To the eyes"
of the Captain this merchant appeared small and thin.  He wore a long
"garment like a frock-coat, a velvet cap, and high, well-cleaned boots."
"He had a thin face with prominent cheekbones, a wedge-shaped greyish"
"beard, and a high forehead seamed with wrinkles from beneath which"
"shone two narrow, blinking, and observant grey eyes ... a sharp,"
"gristly nose, a small mouth with thin lips ... altogether his"
"appearance was pious, rapacious, and respectably wicked. ""Cursed"
"cross-bred fox and pig!"" swore the Captain under his breath, recalling"
his first meeting with Petunikoff. The merchant came with one of the
"town councillors to buy the house, and seeing the Captain asked his"
companion:
"""Is this your lodger?"""
seemed to them a fitting pretext to suppress the _bonae literae_. 'I
"have declared that you are perfectly unknown to me, that I have not yet"
read your books and therefore neither approve nor disapprove anything.'
"'I reserve myself, so far as I may, to be of use to the reviving"
studies. Discreet moderation seems likely to bring better progress than
impetuosity. It was by this that Christ subjugated the world.'
"On the same day he writes to John Lang, one of Luther's friends and"
"followers, a short note, not meant for publication: 'I hope that the"
endeavours of yourself and your party will be successful. Here the
Papists rave violently.... All the best minds are rejoiced at Luther's
boldness: I do not doubt he will be careful that things do not end in a
quarrel of parties!... We shall never triumph over feigned Christians
"unless we first abolish the tyranny of the Roman see, and of its"
"satellites, the Dominicans, the Franciscans and the Carmelites. But no"
one could attempt that without a serious tumult.'
"As the gulf widens, Erasmus's protestations that he has nothing to do"
with Luther become much more frequent. Relations at Louvain grow ever
more disagreeable and the general sentiment about him ever more unkind.
In August 1519 he turns to the Pope himself for protection against his
opponents. He still fails to see how wide the breach is. He still takes
it all to be quarrels of scholars. King Henry of England and King
Francis of France in their own countries have imposed silence upon the
quarrellers and slanderers; if only the Pope would do the same!
In October he was once more reconciled with the Louvain faculty. It was
"just at this time that Colet died in London, the man who had, better"
"perhaps than anyone else, understood Erasmus's standpoint. Kindred"
spirits in Germany still looked up to Erasmus as the great man who was
on the alert to interpose at the right moment and who had made
"moderation the watchword, until the time should come to give his friends"
Of children such as this you may find any number. Only you have to look
"for them, as they are not brought forward spontaneously. The Burmese,"
"like other people, hate to have their beliefs and ideas ridiculed, and"
from experience they have learned that the object of a foreigner in
inquiring into their ways is usually to be able to show by his contempt
how very much cleverer a man he is than they are. Therefore they are
very shy. But once they understand that you only desire to learn and to
"see, and that you will always treat them with courtesy and"
"consideration, they will tell you all that they think."
"A fellow officer of mine has a Burmese police orderly, a young man about"
"twenty, who has been with him since he came to the district two years"
ago. Yet my friend only discovered accidentally the other day that his
orderly remembers his former life. He is very unwilling to talk about
"it. He was a woman apparently in that former life, and lived about"
"twenty miles away. He must have lived a good life, for it is a step of"
promotion to be a man in this life; but he will not talk of it. He
"forgets most of it, he says, though he remembered it when he was a"
child.
Sometimes this belief leads to lawsuits of a peculiarly difficult
"nature. In 1883, two years before the annexation of Upper Burma, there"
"was a case that came into the local Court of the oil district, which"
depended upon this theory of transmigration.
Opposite Yenangyaung there are many large islands in the river. These
"islands during the low water months are joined to the mainland, and are"
covered with a dense high grass in which many deer live.
"When the river rises, it rises rapidly, communication with the mainland"
"is cut off, and the islands are for a time, in the higher rises,"
entirely submerged. During the progress of the first rise some hunters
A horde of civilians was thronging the main street of the village. Old
men and women were carrying all that was left to them of their property
on their backs. Others were pushing wheelbarrows heaped up with clothes
and household utensils. Girls were carrying heavy bundles under their
"arms and dragging tired, tearful children along. White-faced, sorrowful"
"mothers were carrying peevish babies. Great wagons, loaded with"
"furniture and bedding, and whole families sitting on top, were drawn by"
"lank and bony horses. A little cart, with a pallid, aged woman cowering"
"inside, was drawn painfully along by a white-haired man. They passed by"
"us in the gathering gloom, and there seemed to be no end to these"
"straggling multitudes of ruined, homeless people who were wandering"
westwards to escape the disaster that threatened to engulf us all.
The eastern sky flickered with vivid gun-flashes and scintillated with
brilliant shell-bursts. The night was full of rustling noises and sullen
"thunder-claps, while a more distant roaring and rumbling seemed to break"
against some invisible shore like the breakers of a stormy sea.
We retired to our huts and tents. Soon after lights-out the Police
Corporal came round and shouted:
"""Parade at 4.45 to-morrow morning in marching order."""
The tumult increased as though the surge were coming nearer and nearer.
Shells of small calibre passed overhead with a prolonged whistle and
burst with a hardly audible report. The thunder of bigger explosions
shook the huts and caused the ground to tremble.
As I woke the next morning the din of the cannonade broke in upon my
"senses with a sudden impact. Rumbling, thundering, bellowing, rushing,"
"whistling, and whining, the tumult seemed all around and above us."
Sudden flashes lit up the whole camp so that for fractions of seconds
"important) of the reigning beauties of the gay world, Grey felt that it"
would indeed be impossible to speak in this company of any of those
"things which were in his mind.  He contented himself by standing aloof,"
"looking out of the window and sipping his chocolate, whilst the gay"
"flood of talk surged around him, and he caught a word here and a phrase"
"there, but always heard when Lord Sandford’s resonant tones dominated"
those of all others.
"""Talk of rival beauties; we shall see sport to-night.  Lady Romaine and"
Lady Saltire—dearest friends and dearest foes—are to go to Vauxhall
"Gardens to-night, each in a new toilet specially designed and ordered"
"for the occasion.  It will be a ladies’ battle, in very truth; and"
public opinion must needs decide which of the rival queens is fairest to
"look upon.  I have promised both the dear creatures to be there, to give"
my admiration to both alike. Shall I risk the undying enmity of either
"by giving the palm to one?  No such fool, gentlemen—no such fool is"
Sandford.  I vow I will have ready such a pretty speech or couplet for
"each that she shall go away with a better opinion of me than ever!  Ha,"
"ha, ha!  I love to see the pretty dears, tricked out in their finery,"
"and ready to tear each other’s eyes out!  So, gentlemen, I cancel all"
"previous engagements for to-night.  I am for Vauxhall, and Heaven only"
"knows how late we shall be detained there by the battle of beauty."""
"""We will all be there!"" cried the young bloods, who were at all times"
ready to follow Lord Sandford to whatever place of entertainment he
"elected to go; and one voice followed with a laughing question,—"
"""Will the snow maiden be there in the train of her mother?"""
"Grey felt himself start, and was glad his face was turned away.  He"
would not for worlds that the sharp mocking eyes of Lord Sandford should
"see him at this moment, albeit he had no notion of any sort that he had"
"I do not know if this be a paradox, I know that it is a truth."
There was one point that puzzled me for a time in some of these stories
"of transmigration, such as the one I told about the man and wife being"
"reborn twins. It was this: A man dies and leaves behind children, let us"
"say, to whom he is devoutly attached. He is reborn in another family in"
"the same village, maybe. It would be natural to suppose that he would"
"love his former family as much as, or even more than, his new one."
Complications might arise in this way which it is easy to conceive would
cause great and frequent difficulties.
"I explained this to a Burman one day, and asked him what happened, and"
"this is what he said: 'The affection of mother to son, of husband to"
"wife, of brother to sister, belongs entirely to the body in which you"
"may happen to be living. When it dies, so do these affections. New"
"affections arise from the new body. The flesh of the son, being of one"
"with his father, of course loves him; but as his present flesh has no"
"sort of connection with his former one, he does not love those to whom"
he was related in his other lives. These affections are as much a part
of the body as the hand or the eyesight; with one you put off the
other.'
"Thus all love, to the learned, even the purest affection of daughter to"
"mother, of man to his friend, is in theory a function of the body--with"
"the one we put off the other; and this may explain, perhaps, something"
"of what my previous chapter did not make quite clear, that in the"
hereafter[2] of Buddhism there is no affection.
"When we have put off all bodies, when we have attained Nirvana, love and"
"hate, desire and repulsion, will have fallen from us for ever."
"Meanwhile, in each life, we are obliged to endure the affections of the"
"the poor fisherman of Galilee.... Hence one can gaze up into the dome,"
with its huge letters in purple-blue mosaic upon a gold ground (each
"six feet long)--Tu es Petrus, et super hanc petram ædificabo ecclesiam"
"meam, et tibi dabo claves regni coelorum.' Above this are four colossal"
mosaics of the Evangelists.... The pen of St. Luke is seven feet in
"length."""
But we must not permit ourselves to be diverted from our proper subject
"by the vastness and splendor of the building, natural as it is to do"
so when standing under this matchless dome. The four huge piers which
support the dome are used as shrines for the four great relics of the
"church, viz.: 1. The lance of St. Longinus, the soldier who pierced the"
Saviour's side; 2. A portion of the true cross; 3. The napkin of St.
"Veronica, containing the miraculous impression of our Lord's face; and"
4. The head of the apostle Andrew.
"I did not see these relics myself, as I was in the East when they were"
"exhibited, but on April 11th, the day before Easter, other members of"
"my party did, that is, they saw all of them but Andrew's head, and"
from a letter written me by the youngest of my correspondents in my
"own family, giving not only description, but drawings of the spear"
"head, the cross and the handkerchief in their several frames, I infer"
"that, notwithstanding the great height of the Veronica balcony from"
"which they are exhibited, my young correspondent and his companions"
fared better in the matter of a good view than Fritz in _Chronicles
"of the Schönberg Cotta Family_, who says: ""To-day we gazed on the"
Veronica--the holy impression left by our Saviour's face on the cloth
"S. Veronica presented to him to wipe his brow, bowed under the weight"
"of the cross. We had looked forward to this sight for days, for seven"
thousand years of indulgence from penance are attached to it. But when
the moment came we could see nothing but a black board hung with a
"cloth, before which another white cloth was held. In a few minutes this"
"ledge, while his body caught in the bushes, hung a moment, then dashed"
after its comrades below.
"Just then the end of a rope fell dangling by their side, let down from"
"the ramparts above. The duke tried to grasp it, but it shifted beyond"
"the gap. Down the rope came a man, then another; they both gained a"
"foothold on the narrow ledge. No sooner were their feet on it, than"
the duke sent them headlong to the bottom. Then grasping the rope
"without waiting to see if a third or fourth were coming down, he"
"shouted to Francesco to follow. Perilous as was the task, it was no"
"more so than to follow the steep and narrow goat's trail, and in a"
brief space of time they swung into a courtyard which was deserted.
"Anticipating no attack on this side, the defenders of Astura had"
"turned their whole attention to the southern slope, where the Pisans"
were scaling the walls. The roar of the conflict seemed to grow with
"the roar of the hurricane, and, as one by one the duke's men leaped"
"into the dark square, and the muster was complete, Count Rupert turned"
to Francesco.
"""I feared lest they might clean out the nest before our arrival,"" he"
"said, then, pointing to a distant glare of torches, he gave the word."
They caught the unwary defenders in the rear. No quarter was to be
given; the robber brood of Astura was to be exterminated.
"""Conradino!"" was the password, and above the taunts and cries of"
"Frangipani's hirelings it filled the night with its clamor, rode on"
"the wings of the storm, like the war-cry of a thousand demons."
Notwithstanding the fact that a few of the most daring among the Pisan
"admiral's men had scaled the ramparts and, leaping into the"
"Frangipani's stronghold, had tried to pave a way for those lagging"
"behind, their companions-in-arms were in dire straits. For those of"
CHOCO INDIAN OF SAMBU VALLEY
Silver beads about his neck and leg. Face painted in glaring colors]
As a rule these Indians--men or women--are not pleasing to the eye. The
"lips are thick, the nose flat and broad, the hair coarse and always jet"
black. Yet the children are not infrequently really beautiful. Any
traveler in Panama who forsakes the beaten track up and down the Canal
Zone will be impressed by the wide extent to which beauty is found among
"the children, whatever their race or combination of races. But the charm"
soon fades. It is seldom that one sees a mature woman who is attractive
to Caucasian eyes. Among the women of the Guaymies face painting is
"practiced only on great occasions, black, red and white being the usual"
"colors. The men go painted at all times, the invariable pattern being a"
"sort of inverted V, with the apex between the eyes, and the two arms"
"extending to points, half an inch or so from the corners of the mouth."
"The lips are colored to make them seem thicker than normal, and heavy"
shadows are painted in under the eyes.
Among some tribes the wealth of a man is reckoned by the number of his
"cattle; among the Guaymies by the number of his wives. For this reason,"
"perhaps, the attainment of marriageable age is an occasion of much"
festivity for children of both sexes. The boy is exposed to tests of his
"manly and war-like qualities, and, in company with his fellows of equal"
"age, is taken by the wisemen of the tribe into the solitude of the"
forest that by performing tasks assigned to him he may prove himself a
"man. There, too, they learn from the elders, who go masked and crowned"
"with wreaths, the traditions of their tribes told in rude chants like"
the Norse sagas. Until this ceremony has been fulfilled the youth has no
name whatsoever. After it he is named and celebrates his first birthday.
The ceremonies in which the girls play the chief part are less
"""Oh, if I could only save him, Lois! He was the first man I had ever"
"met whom I trusted, the first to trust me. I owe him everything, the"
little that is good in me. It had to come to life when he believed in
"it so implicitly. And he owes me ruin, outward and inward ruin."""
"Lois made no answer. With a warm, impulsive gesture she put her arms"
"about the taller woman's neck and, drawing the beautiful face down to"
"her own, kissed her. Beatrice responded, and thus a friendship was"
"sealed--not for life but for death, whose grim cordon was with every"
moment being drawn closer about them.
The sound of firing had now grown incessant. One report followed
"another at swift, irregular intervals, and each sounded like a clap of"
"thunder in the silent room. Mrs. Cary stirred uneasily in her sleep, a"
"low, scarcely audible groan escaped the parted lips, as though even in"
her dreams she was being pursued by fear's pitiless phantom. Her
"self-appointed nurse continued to fan her with the energy of despair,"
the poor livid face twitching at every fresh threatening sound. Mrs.
"Carmichael still pretended to be absorbed in her pinafore, but the"
"revolver lay on the table, ready to hand, and there was a look in the"
steady eyes which boded ill for the first enemy who should confront
her. Lois and Beatrice continued their fruitless task.
A woman's courage is the supreme victory of mind over matter. It is no
easy thing for a hero to sit still and helpless while death rattles
his bullet fingers against the walls and screams in voices of hate and
fury from a distance which every minute diminishes. For a woman
"burdened with the disability of a high-strung nervous system, it is a"
"martyrdom. Yet these women, brought up on the froth of an enervating,"
"pleasure-seeking society, held out--held out with a martyr's courage"
"and constancy--against the torture of inactivity, of an imagination"
"When I was sixteen, after I had spent eight years in Devon, and four"
"of those years at an English public school, I was in speech and almost"
in the inner fibres of my mind an Englishman. Your naval authorities
"at Plymouth and Devonport, as serenely trustful and heedless of"
"espionage as the mass of your kindly people, allowed my father--whom I"
"often accompanied--to see the dockyards, the engine shops, the"
"training schools, and the barracks. They knew that he was an Austrian"
"naval officer, and they took him to their hearts as a brother, of the"
common universal brotherhood of the sea. I think that your Navy holds
those of a foreign naval service as more nearly of kin to themselves
than civilians of their own blood. The bond of a common profession is
more close than the bond of a common nationality. I do not doubt that
my father sent much information to our Embassy in London--it was what
he was employed to do--but I am sure that he did not basely betray the
wonderful confidence of his hosts. Our countries were at peace. My
father is no Prussian; he is a chivalrous gentleman. I am sure that he
did not send more than his English naval friends were content at the
time that he should send. For in those years your newspapers and your
books upon the Royal Navy of England concealed little from the world.
I have visited Dartmouth; I have dined in the Naval College there with
"bright sailor boys of my own age. It was then my one dream, had I"
"remained in England, to have become an Englishman, and to have myself"
"served in your Navy. It was a vain dream, but I knew no better. Fate"
and my birth made me afterwards your enemy. I would have fought you
"gladly face to face on land or sea, but never, never, would I have"
stabbed the meanest of Englishmen in the back.
When I was sixteen years old I left England with my parents and
returned to Triest. I was a good mathematician with a keen taste for
"mechanics. I spent two years in the naval engineering shops at Pola,"
and I was gazetted as a sub-lieutenant in the engineering branch of
"Fairy Tale element presented to him. In “Father and Son,” Mr. Edmund"
Gosse says:
"“Meanwhile, capable as I was of reading, I found my greatest pleasure"
"in the pages of books. The range of these was limited, for story-books"
"of every description were sternly excluded. No fiction of any kind,"
"religious or secular, was admitted into the house. In this it was to"
"my Mother, not to my Father, that the prohibition was due. She had a"
"remarkable, I confess, to me somewhat unaccountable impression that to"
"‘tell a story,’ that is, to compose fictitious narrative of any kind,"
was a sin.... Nor would she read the chivalrous tales in the verse of
"Sir Walter Scott, obstinately alleging that they were not true. She"
"would read nothing but lyrical and subjective poetry.... As a child,"
"however, she had possessed a passion for making up stories, and so"
"considerable a skill in it, that she was constantly being begged to"
"indulge others with its exercise.... ‘When I was a very little child,’"
"she says, ‘I used to amuse myself and my brothers with inventing"
"stories such as I had read. Having, as I suppose, naturally a restless"
"mind and busy imagination, this soon became the chief pleasure of"
"my life. Unfortunately, my brothers were always fond of encouraging"
"this propensity, and I found in Taylor, my maid, a still greater"
"tempter. I had not known there was any harm in it, until Miss Shore (a"
"Calvinistic governess), finding it out, lectured me severely and told"
me it was wicked. From that time forth I considered that to invent
a story of any kind was a sin.... But the longing to invent stories
grew with violence. The simplicity of Truth was not enough for me. I
"must needs embroider imagination upon it, and the folly and wickedness"
which disgraced my heart are more than I am able to express....’ This
"(the Author, her son, adds) is surely a very painful instance of the"
repression of an instinct.”
"In contrast to the stifling of the imagination, it is good to recall"
acknowledged the authority of the Ancients without any evidence. How
"naïvely he appeals to Antiquity, again and again, to justify some bold"
"feat! He is critical, they say? Were not the Ancients critical? He"
"permits himself to insert digressions? So did the Ancients, etc."
Erasmus is in profound sympathy with that revered Antiquity by his
fundamental conviction that it is the practice of life which matters.
Not he is the great philosopher who knows the tenets of the Stoics or
Peripatetics by rote--but he who expresses the meaning of philosophy by
"his life and his morals, for that is its purpose. He is truly a divine"
"who teaches, not by artful syllogisms, but by his disposition, by his"
"face and his eyes, by his life itself, that wealth should be despised."
To live up to that standard is what Christ himself calls _Renascentia_.
Erasmus uses the word in the Christian sense only. But in that sense it
is closely allied to the idea of the Renaissance as a historical
phenomenon. The worldly and pagan sides of the Renaissance have nearly
"always been overrated. Erasmus is, much more than Aretino or"
"Castiglione, the representative of the spirit of his age, one over whose"
Christian sentiment the sweet gale of Antiquity had passed. And that
very union of strong Christian endeavour and the spirit of Antiquity is
the explanation of Erasmus's wonderful success.

The mere intention and the contents of the mind do not influence the
"world, if the form of expression does not cooperate. In Erasmus the"
quality of his talent is a very important factor. His perfect clearness
"and ease of expression, his liveliness, wit, imagination, gusto and"
humour have lent a charm to all he wrote which to his contemporaries was
"irresistible and captivates even us, as soon as we read him. In all that"
"constitutes his talent, Erasmus is perfectly and altogether a"
"representative of the Renaissance. There is, in the first place, his"
Anglicans alike. Your Heaven will be a small place. From Southampton I
went to the torpedo training-ship _Vernon_. Again I had no difficulty.
I was a workman of skill and intelligence. I was there for more than
"two years, learning all your secrets, and storing them in my mind for"
the benefit of my own Service at home.
It was at Portsmouth that there came to me the great temptation of my
"life, for I fell in love, not as you colder people do, but as a"
"Latin of the warm South. She was an English girl of good, if"
"undistinguished, family. Though in my hours of duty I belonged to that"
"you call the 'working classes,' I was well off, and lived in private"
"the life of my own class. I had double the pay of my rank, an"
"allowance from my father, and my wages, which were not small. There"
were many English families in Portsmouth and Southsea who were
"graciously pleased to recognise that John Trehayne, trade unionist,"
"and weekly wage-earning workman, was a gentleman by birth and"
breeding. In any foreign port I should have been under police
supervision as a person eminently to be suspected; in Portsmouth I was
accepted without question for what I gave myself out to be--a
gentleman who wished to learn his business from the bottom upwards. I
will say nothing of the lady of my heart except that I loved her
"passionately, and should have married her--aye, and become an"
"Englishman in fact, casting off my own, country--if War had not blown"
"my ignoble plans to shatters. There was nothing ignoble in my love,"
"for she was a queen among women, but in myself for permitting the hot"
blood of youth to blind my eyes to the duty claimed of me by my
"country. When war became imminent, I was not recalled, as I had hoped"
"to be, since I wished to fight afloat as became my rank and family. I"
was ordered to take such steps as most effectively aided me to observe
"the English plans and preparations, and to report when possible to"
"Vienna. In other words, I was ordered to act in your midst as a"
special intelligence officer--what you would call a Spy. It was an
"prompted, she drew up a chair and prepared to pass the rest of the night"
in watching by his side.
For an hour or so he slept the sleep of unconsciousness. In the room not
"a sound could be heard, but outside the storm still roared and raged. It"
was anything but an easy or cheerful situation: Here she was alone with
"a wounded, if not dying, man; and she well knew that, unless there came"
"an abatement in the fury of the storm, it might be days before anyone"
"could climb the mountain. True, the Indians were not far off, but like"
as not they would remain in their wigwam until the sun came forth again.
"In the matter of food there was a scant supply, but probably enough to"
tide them over until communication could be had with The Polka.
"For three days she watched over him, and all the time the storm"
"continued. On the third day he became delirious, and that was the night"
of her torture. Despite a feeling that she was taking an unfair
"advantage of him, the Girl strained her ears to catch a name which, in"
"his delirium, was constantly on his lips; but she could not make it out."
"All that she knew was that it was not her name that he spoke, and it"
"pained her. She had given him absolute faith and trust and, already, she"
was overwhelmed with the fierce flames of jealousy. It was a new
"sensation, this being jealous of anyone, and it called forth a"
passionate resentment. In such moments she would rise and flee to the
other end of the room until the whispered endearments had ceased. Then
she would draw near again with flushes of shame on her cheeks for having
"heeded the sayings of an irresponsible person, and she would take his"
"head in her lap and, caressing him the while, would put cold towels on"
his heated brow.
"Dawn of the fourth day saw the Girl still pale and anxious, though"
despair had entirely left her; for the storm was over and colour and
speech had come back to the man early that morning. Love and good
"that a fervent Buddhist will not kill even a fish, but a fisherman is"
not quite such a reprobate as a hunter in popular estimation. And the
"Nats think so too, for the Nat of a pool will not forbid all fishing."
"You must give him his share; you must be respectful to him, and not"
"offend him; and then he will fill your nets with gleaming fish, and all"
"will go well with you. If not, of course, you will come to grief; your"
"nets will be torn, and your boat upset; and finally, if obstinate, you"
"will be drowned. A great arm will seize you, and you will be pulled"
under and disappear for ever.
A Nat is much like a human being; if you treat him well he will treat
"you well, and conversely. Courtesy is never wasted on men or Nats, at"
"least, so a Burman tells me."
The highest Nats live in the mountains. The higher the Nat the higher
"the mountain; and when you get to a very high peak indeed, like"
"Mainthong Peak in Wuntho, you encounter very powerful Nats."
"They tell a story of Mainthong Peak and the Nats there, how all of a"
"sudden, one day in 1885, strange noises came from the hill. High up on"
his mighty side was heard the sound of great guns firing slowly and
"continuously; there was the thunder of falling rocks, cries as of"
"someone bewailing a terrible calamity, and voices calling from the"
precipices. The people living in their little hamlets about his feet
were terrified. Something they knew had happened of most dire import to
"them, some catastrophe which they were powerless to prevent, which they"
could not even guess. But when a few weeks later there came even into
"those remote villages the news of the fall of Mandalay, of the surrender"
"of the king, of the 'great treachery,' they knew that this was what the"
Nats had been sorrowing over. All the Nats everywhere seem to have been
"distressed at our arrival, to hate our presence, and to earnestly desire"
"our absence. They are the spirits of the country and of the people, and"
of being borne upwards. Piéron has also noted this sensation at the moment
"of death from disease in a number of cases, usually accompanied by a sense"
"of well-being.[129] The cases he describes were mostly tuberculous, and"
"included individuals of both sexes, and of atheistic as well as religious"
"belief. In all, the last sensation to which expression was given was"
"one of flying, of moving upwards. In some death was peaceful, in others"
"painful. In one case a girl died clasping the iron bars of the bed, in"
"horror of being borne upwards. Piéron, no doubt rightly, associates this"
sensation with the similar sensation of rising and floating common in
"dreams, and with the feeling of moving upwards and resting on the air"
experienced by persons in the ecstatic state. In all these cases alike
"life is being concentrated in the brain and central organs, while the"
outlying districts of the body are becoming numb and dead.
In this way it comes about that out of dreams and of dream-like waking
"states, one of the most permanent of human spiritual conceptions has been"
"evolved. To float, to rise into the air, to fly up to heaven, has always"
seemed to man to be the final climax of spiritual activity. The angel is
the most ethereal creature the human imagination can conceive. Browning's
"cry to his 'lyric love, half angel and half bird,' pathetically crude as"
"poetry, is sound as psychology. The prophets and divine heroes of the race"
have constantly seemed to their devout followers to disappear at last by
"floating up into the sky, like Elijah, who went up 'by a whirlwind into"
"heaven.' St. Peter once thought he saw his Master walking on the waves,"
and the last vision of Jesus in the Gospels reveals him rising into
the air. For it is in the world of dreams that the human soul has its
"indestructible home, and in the attempt to realise these dreams lies a"
large part of our business in life.

[Footnote 100: Bk. IV. 1014-15:
"kaloma!"" She looked closer, and said: ""Oh no, you are not red. Your"
"name is momoka."" She took then the stick with the kaloma discs and"
"thrust it into a hole of the reef. It stood there, but when she looked"
"at it, she said: ""Oh, the people from inland would come and see you"
"and pluck you off."" She went, she pulled out the stick; she went into"
"a canoe, and she paddled. She paddled out into the sea. She anchored"
"there, pulled the discs off the stick, and she threw them into the"
"sea so that they might come into the coral outcrop. She said: ""It"
is forbidden that the inland natives should take the valuables. The
"people of Sinaketa only must dive."" Thus only the Sinaketa people"
"know the magic, and how to dive."
This myth presents certain remarkable characteristics. I shall not
"enter into its sociology, though it differs in that respect from"
"the Kiriwinian myths, in which the equality of the Sinaketan and the"
Gumilababan chiefs with those of Omarakana is not acknowledged. It is
characteristic that the Malasi woman in this myth shows an aversion to
"the dog, the totem animal of the Lukuba clan, a clan which according"
to mythical and historical data had to recede before and yield its
"priority to the Malasi (compare Chapter XII, Division IV). Another"
"detail of interest is that she brings the kaloma on their sticks,"
"as they appear in the final stage of manufacturing. In this form,"
"also, she tries to plant them on the reef. The finished kaloma,"
"however, to use the words of one of my informants, ""looked at her,"
"the water swinging it to and fro; flashing its red eyes."" And the"
"woman, seeing it, pulls out the too accessible and too inviting"
kaloma and scatters them over the deep sea. Thus she makes them
"inaccessible to the uninitiated inland villagers, and monopolises them"
for Sinaketa. There can be no doubt that the villages of Vakuta have
learnt this industry from the Sinaketans. The myth is hardly known in
"Vakuta, only a few are experts in diving and manufacturing; there is"
a tradition about a late transference of this industry there; finally
the queen and her train of ladies to the place kept for her. Guards were
put all about to prevent the people crowding; and then came the
"soldiers, and in the midst of them the blacksmith; and amid many cries"
"of 'Traitor, traitor!' and shouts of derision, he was bound to the iron"
"post within the wood and the straw, and the guards fell back."
"The queen sat and watched it all, and said never a word. Fire was put to"
"the pyre, and it crept rapidly up in long red tongues with coils of"
"black smoke. It went very quickly, for the wood was very dry, and a"
light breeze came laughing up the river and helped it. The flames played
"about the man chained there in the midst, and he made never a sign; only"
"he looked steadily across at the purple mountain where his home lay, and"
it was clear that in a few more moments he would be dead. There was a
deep silence everywhere.
"Then of a sudden, before anyone knew, before a hand could be held out to"
"hinder her, the queen rose from her seat and ran to the pyre. In a"
"moment she was there and had thrown herself into the flames, and with"
her arms about her brother's neck she turned and faced the myriad eyes
"that glared upon them--the queen, in all the glory of her beauty,"
"glittering with gems, and the man with great shackled bare limbs,"
"dressed in a few rags, his muscles already twisted with the agony of the"
"fire. A great cry of horror came from the people, and there was the"
movement of guards and officers rushing to stop the fire; but it was all
"of no use. A flash of red flames came out of the logs, folding these"
"twain like an imperial cloak, a whirl of sparks towered into the air,"
and when one could see again the woman and her brother were no longer
"there. They were dead and burnt, and the bodies mingled with the ashes"
"of the fire. She had cost her brother his life, and she went with him"
into death.
The young man had not been a fortnight in town before finding his
"capital doubled, as well as all bills paid to the astonished tradesmen,"
who seldom looked to receive their money within a twelvemonth.  He was
disposed to be troubled at this easy fashion of making money; but Lord
Sandford laughed him to scorn.
"""Zounds, man, what does it matter?  Those young popinjays are bound to"
lose their money to some one. Why not then to honest fellows like you
"and me, who pay our bills and do good to the community with the money?"
Scruples!  Faugh! you must rid yourself of them!  Sir Hugh Dumaresq’s
"son need not trouble himself thus.  Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow"
"we die.  Isn’t that good Scripture?""  But the reckless young lord paled"
a little at the sound of his own words.  He had seen sudden death once
too often for his peace of mind of late.
"In sooth, Grey felt but little scruple in taking his winnings.  The"
"young man was not greatly in advance of his age, although he was indued"
with a nature more finely strung and aspirations more lofty than
belonged to most.  Gambling was so much a matter of course both in this
"and in other lands, and the devotees of the amusement so numerous and so"
"bent upon their sport, that it would have needed stronger convictions"
than Grey as yet possessed to make any stand on such a point.  He took
"the same risks as the others, and if his coolness of head, steadiness of"
"hand, and quick observation and memory served to make for success in his"
"case, he rather regarded this as a witness to his superiority, and felt"
only a small sense of reluctance in pocketing his gains; which
reluctance he could only attribute to a lingering memory of words spoken
"by his mother when he was a growing boy, and news came to them from time"
"to time of Sir Hugh’s losses over cards, and the necessity for further"
retrenchments upon the already impoverished estate.
"policeman into a skilled worker at a moment's notice. How is it done?"""
"""He begins at the other end. All his skilled workmen are the best he"
can pick out of their various trades. They have served their full time
as apprentices and journeymen. They are recommended to him by their
"employers after careful testing and sounding. Most of them, I believe,"
come from the Government dockyards and ordnance factories. They are
"given a course of police training at Scotland Yard, and then dropped"
"down wherever they may be wanted. Dawson, and inspectors like him,"
"have these men everywhere--in shipyards, in shell shops, in gun"
"factories, in aeroplane sheds, everywhere. They take a leading part in"
"the councils of the unions wherever they go, for they add to their"
"skill as workmen a pronounced, even blatant parade of loyalty to the"
interests of trade unions and a tasty flavour of socialist principles.
"Dawson is perfectly cynically outspoken to me over the business which,"
"I confess, appals me. In his female agents--of which he has many--he"
favours what he calls a 'judicious frailty'; in his male agents he
favours a subtle skill in the verbal technique of anarchism. And this
"man Dawson is by religion a Peculiar Baptist, in private life a"
"faithful husband and a loving father, and in politics a strict Liberal"
"of the Manchester School! As a man he is good, honest, and rather"
"narrow; as a professional detective he is base and mean, utterly"
"without scruple, and a Jesuit of Jesuits. With him the end justifies"
"the means, whatever the means may be."""
"""And yet you admit that his value to the country is beyond payment."
Dawson--our remarkable Dawson of the double life in the two
"compartments, professional and private, which never are allowed to"
overlap--Dawson is an instrument of war. We do not like using gas or
"liquid fire, but we are compelled to use them. We do not like"
"espionage, but we must employ it. As one who loves this fair land of"
"England beyond everything in the world, and as one who would do"
"thousand years, among the venomous sycophants, among the idle boasters,"
among the incompetent physicians'.
The self-centred element in Erasmus must needs increase accordingly as
he in truth became a centre and objective point of ideas and culture.
There really was a time when it must seem to him that the world hinged
"upon him, and that it awaited the redeeming word from him. What a"
"widespread enthusiastic following he had, how many warm friends and"
venerators! There is something naïve in the way in which he thinks it
"requisite to treat all his friends, in an open letter, to a detailed,"
rather repellent account of an illness that attacked him on the way back
"from Basle to Louvain. _His_ part, _his_ position, _his_ name, this more"
and more becomes the aspect under which he sees world-events. Years will
come in which his whole enormous correspondence is little more than one
protracted self-defence.
Yet this man who has so many friends is nevertheless solitary at heart.
And in the depth of that heart he desires to be alone. He is of a most
retiring disposition; he is _a recluse_. 'I have always wished to be
"alone, and there is nothing I hate so much as sworn partisans.' Erasmus"
is one of those whom contact with others weakens. The less he has to
"address and to consider others, friends or enemies, the more truly he"
utters his deepest soul. Intercourse with particular people always
"causes little scruples in him, intentional amenities, coquetry,"
"reticences, reserves, spiteful hits, evasions. Therefore it should not"
be thought that we get to know him to the core from his letters. Natures
"like his, which all contact with men unsettles, give their best and"
deepest when they speak impersonally and to all.
After the early effusions of sentimental affection he no longer opens
his heart unreservedly to others. At bottom he feels separated from all
and on the alert towards all. There is a great fear in him that others
the woman of the myth. It begins with a long list of ancestral names;
then follows a boastful picture of how the whole fleet admires the
magical success of the magician's spell. The key-word in the main part
"is the word 'itolo': 'it stands up,' i.e., 'it starts,' and with this,"
"there are enumerated all the various classes of the kaloma shell,"
"differentiated according to size, colour and quality. It ends up with"
"another boast; ""My canoe is overloaded with shell so that it sinks,"""
which is repeated with varying phraseology.
"This spell the magician may utter once only, or he may repeat it"
several times on successive days. He fixes then the final date for the
"fishing expedition. On the evening before that date, the men perform"
"some private magic, every one in his own house. The hammering stone,"
"the gabila, which is always a binabina (it is a stone imported from"
"the Koya), is charmed over. As a rule it is put on a piece of dried"
banana leaf with some red hibiscus blossoms and leaves or flowers
"of red colour. A formula is uttered over it, and the whole is then"
wrapped up in the banana leaf and kept there until it is used. This
"will make the stone a lucky one in hitting off many shells, and it"
will make the shells very red.
Another rite of private magic consists in charming a large mussel
"shell, with which, on the next morning, the body of the canoe will"
"be scraped. This makes the sea clear, so that the diver may easily"
see and frequently find his spondylus shells.
Next morning the whole fleet starts on the expedition. Some food has
"been taken into the canoes, as the fishing usually lasts for a few"
"days, the nights being spent on the beach of Nanoula. When the canoes"
"arrive at a certain point, about half-way between Sinaketa and Nanoula,"
they all range themselves in a row. The canoe of the magician is at the
"right flank, and he medicates a bunch of red hibiscus flowers, some"
know it!  I feel it!  The Old Lion is not dead yet!  He shall roar again
"in his native forest.  Say, boy, will you be my helper in this thing?"
"And in the gains which we shall make we will share and share alike."""
It was a very different sort of fame from anything Grey had pictured for
"himself, and for a moment he hesitated; for he realized that were this"
"dramatic sketch to take hold of the imagination of the town, and draw"
"fashionable audiences, he could scarcely avoid recognition, disguise"
himself as he might.  But as against this there was the pressing need of
the moment.  He was well-nigh penniless; his romance seemed likely to be
"but so much waste paper.  He was hiding now even from Dick, who"
"periodically visited London to see him, lest the honest fellow should"
insist upon maintaining him from his own small hoard.  Here was an
"opening, as it seemed, to something like prosperity; and the alternative"
of being drafted into the army as a pauper recruit was scarcely
"sufficiently attractive to weigh in the balance.  Moreover, there was"
something so earnest and pathetic in the glance bent upon him by the Old
"Lion that he had not the heart to say him nay, and he held out his hand"
with a smile.
"""I will be your helper; and as for the gains, let them be yours, and you"
"shall give me what wage I merit.  The play is yours, the thought is"
yours: it is for you to reap the harvest.  I am but the labourer—worthy
"of his hire, and no more."""
"The compact was sealed, and the old man then insisted that Grey should"
"take his bed for the night, as he must sit up and remodel his play upon"
"lines indicated by the young man, who had seen the field of Ramillies"
and the disposition of troops.  Grey furnished him with sundry diagrams
"and notes, and left him perfectly happy at his task, which would"
"doubtless occupy him during the night, whilst the weary guest slumbered"
peacefully upon the humble bed in the little alcove beyond the larger
The senses are open for the nice observation of the curious. Though
"Erasmus does not know that need of proving the secrets of nature, which"
"inspired a Leonardo da Vinci, a Paracelsus, a Vesalius, he is also, by"
"his keen observation, a child of his time. For peculiarities in the"
habits and customs of nations he has an open eye. He notices the gait of
"Swiss soldiers, how dandies sit, how Picards pronounce French. He"
notices that in old pictures the sitters are always represented with
"half-closed eyes and tightly shut lips, as signs of modesty, and how"
"some Spaniards still honour this expression in life, while German art"
"prefers lips pouting as for a kiss. His lively sense of anecdote, to"
"which he gives the rein in all his writings, belongs here."
"And, in spite of all his realism, the world which Erasmus sees and"
"renders, is not altogether that of the sixteenth century. Everything is"
veiled by Latin. Between the author's mind and reality intervenes his
antique diction. At bottom the world of his mind is imaginary. It is a
subdued and limited sixteenth-century reality which he reflects.
Together with its coarseness he lacks all that is violent and direct in
"his times. Compared with the artists, with Luther and Calvin, with the"
"statesmen, the navigators, the soldiers and the scientists, Erasmus"
confronts the world as a recluse. It is only the influence of Latin. In
"spite of all his receptiveness and sensitiveness, Erasmus is never fully"
"in contact with life. All through his work not a bird sings, not a wind"
rustles.
But that reserve or fear of directness is not merely a negative quality.
It also results from a consciousness of the indefiniteness of the ground
"of all things, from the awe of the ambiguity of all that is. If Erasmus"
"so often hovers over the borderline between earnestness and mockery, if"
"he hardly ever gives an incisive conclusion, it is not only due to"
"cautiousness, and fear to commit himself. Everywhere he sees the"
"shadings, the blending of the meaning of words. The terms of things are"
"of undue friendliness with Sir Jhon the Priest, but he dare not say so."
"Tyb guesses his doubts, and in her turn suspects that he is inclined to"
rebel. So she makes the yoke heavier. Johan Johan has to invite Sir Jhon
"to eat a most desirable pie with them; but throughout the meal, with"
jealousy at his heart and the still greater pangs of unsatisfied hunger
"a little lower, he is kept busy by his wife, trying to mend a leaky"
bucket with wax. Surely never did a scene contain more 'asides' than are
uttered and explained away by the crushed husband! Finally overtaxed
"endurance asserts itself, and wife and priest are driven out of doors;"
but the play closes with a very pronounced note of uncertainty from the
victor as to what new game the vanquished may shortly be at if he be not
there to see.
The all-important feature to be noticed in Heywood's work is that here
we have the drama escaping from its alliance with religion into the
"region of pure comedy. Here is no well planned moral, no sententious"
"mouthpiece of abstract excellence, no ruin of sinners and crowning of"
"saints. Here, too, is no Vice, no Devil, although they are the chief"
"media for comedy in other Interludes, nor is there any buffoonery; even"
"of its near cousins, scuffling and fighting, only one of the three plays"
"has more than a trace. Hence the earlier remark, that Heywood was before"
his time. It is not devils in bearskins and wooden-sworded vices that
create true comedy; they belong to the realm of farce. Yet they
"continued to flourish long after Heywood had set another example, and"
"with them the cuffing of ears and drunken gambolling which we may see,"
"in the works of other men, trying to rescue prosy scenes from dullness."
"In _Johan Johan_ is simple comedy, the comedy of laughter-raising"
"dialogue and 'asides'. We do not say it is perfect comedy, far from it;"
but it is comedy cleared of its former alloys. It is the comedy which
Shakespeare refined for his own use in _Twelfth Night_ and elsewhere.

for him to sleep in. But the curious thing was that the monk seemed to
"know it all. He knew the monastery and the path to it, and the ways"
"about the village, and the names of the hills and the streams. It"
"seemed, indeed, as if he must once have lived there in the village, and"
"yet no one knew him or recognised his face, though he was but a young"
"man still, and there were villagers who had lived there for seventy"
"years. Next morning, instead of going on his way, the monk came into the"
"village with his begging-bowl, as monks do, and went round and collected"
"his food for the day; and in the evening, when the villagers went to see"
"him at the monastery, he told them he was going to stay. He recalled to"
"them the monk who had planted the teak-trees, and how he had said that"
"when the trees were grown he would return. 'I,' said the young monk, 'am"
"he that planted these trees. Lo, they are grown up, and I am returned,"
and now we will build a monastery as I said.'
"When the villagers, doubting, questioned him, and old men came and"
"talked to him of traditions of long-past days, he answered as one who"
knew all. He told them he had been born and educated far away in the
"South, and had grown up not knowing who he had been; and that he had"
"entered a monastery, and in time became a Pongyi. The remembrance came"
"to him, he went on, in a dream of how he had planted the trees and had"
promised to return to that village far away in the forest.
"The very next day he had started, and travelled day after day and week"
"upon week, till at length he had arrived, as they saw. So the villagers"
"were convinced, and they set to work and cut down the great boles, and"
built the monastery such as my friend saw. And the monk lived there all
"his life, and taught the children, and preached the marvellous teaching"
"of the great Buddha, till at length his time came again and he returned;"
"for of monks it is not said that they die, but that they return."
This is the common belief of the people. Into this has the mystery of
"The true occupation for a mind like his was paraphrasing, in which,"
"indeed, he amply indulged. Soothing down and unfolding was just the work"
he liked. It is characteristic that he paraphrased the whole New
Testament except the Apocalypse.
Erasmus's mind was neither philosophic nor historic. His was neither the
"work of exact, logical discrimination, nor of grasping the deep sense of"
the way of the world in broad historical visions in which the
"particulars themselves, in their multiplicity and variegation, form the"
image. His mind is philological in the fullest sense of the word. But by
that alone he would not have conquered and captivated the world. His
mind was at the same time of a deeply ethical and rather strong
aesthetic trend and those three together have made him great.
"The foundation of Erasmus's mind is his fervent desire of freedom,"
"clearness, purity, simplicity and rest. It is an old ideal of life to"
"which he gave new substance by the wealth of his mind. Without liberty,"
life is no life; and there is no liberty without repose. The fact that
he never took sides definitely resulted from an urgent need of perfect
"independence. Each engagement, even a temporary one, was felt as a"
"fetter by Erasmus. An interlocutor in the _Colloquies_, in which he so"
"often, spontaneously, reveals his own ideals of life, declares himself"
"determined neither to marry, nor to take holy orders, nor to enter a"
"monastery, nor into any connection from which he will afterwards be"
unable to free himself--at least not before he knows himself completely.
"'When will that be? Never, perhaps.' 'On no other account do I"
congratulate myself more than on the fact that I have never attached
"myself to any party,' Erasmus says towards the end of his life."
Liberty should be spiritual liberty in the first place. 'But he that is
"spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man,' is"
the word of Saint Paul. To what purpose should he require prescriptions
in cultured and easy manners. Close by are some of his intellectual
peculiarities. He hates the violent and extravagant. Therefore the
choruses of the Greek drama displease him. The merit of his own poems he
"sees in the fact that they pass passion by, they abstain from pathos"
"altogether--'there is not a single storm in them, no mountain torrent"
"overflowing its banks, no exaggeration whatever. There is great"
frugality in words. My poetry would rather keep within bounds than
"exceed them, rather hug the shore than cleave the high seas.' In another"
place he says: 'I am always most pleased by a poem that does not differ
"too much from prose, but prose of the best sort, be it understood. As"
Philoxenus accounted those the most palatable fishes that are no true
"fishes and the most savoury meat what is no meat, the most pleasant"
"voyage, that along the shores, and the most agreeable walk, that along"
the water's edge; so I take especial pleasure in a rhetorical poem and a
"poetical oration, so that poetry is tasted in prose and the reverse.'"
"That is the man of half-tones, of fine shadings, of the thought that is"
never completely expressed. But he adds: 'Farfetched conceits may please
others; to me the chief concern seems to be that we draw our speech from
the matter itself and apply ourselves less to showing off our invention
than to present the thing.' That is the realist.
"From this conception results his admirable, simple clarity, the"
excellent division and presentation of his argument. But it also causes
his lack of depth and the prolixity by which he is characterized. His
machine runs too smoothly. In the endless _apologiae_ of his later
"years, ever new arguments occur to him; new passages to point, or"
"quotations to support, his idea. He praises laconism, but never"
"practises it. Erasmus never coins a sentence which, rounded off and"
"pithy, becomes a proverb and in this manner lives. There are no current"
quotations from Erasmus. The collector of the _Adagia_ has created no
new ones of his own.
"now, or turned his ideas from the task before him. It was no ordinary"
"speech, and no ordinary occasion. He spoke only to five men out of all"
"his audience--the rest were his, or were beyond the power of his charm;"
"on those five important-looking, unhappy-feeling men he bent every"
"effort of his will, and played every device of his mind and his tongue."
"Now and then he distantly threatened them, oftener he made as though to"
convince their cool judgment; again he would invoke the sentiment of old
"alliance in them, or stir their pity for the men whose cause he pleaded."
"Once he flashed out in bitter mockery at Coxon, then jested in mild"
"irony at Puttock and his ""rich man's revolution."" Returning to his text,"
"he minutely dissected his own measure, insisting on its promise,"
"extenuating its fancied danger, claiming for it the merits of a"
courageous and well-conceived scheme. Through all the changes that he
"rang, he was heard with close attention, broken only by demonstrations"
of approval or of dissent. At last one of his periods extorted a cheer
from a waverer. It acted on him as a spur to fresh exertions. He raised
"his voice till it filled the chamber, and began his last and most"
elaborate appeal.
Suddenly a change came over his hearers. The breathless silence of
engrossed attention gave place to a subdued stir; whispers were heard
"here and there. Men were handing a newspaper about, accompanying its"
"transfer with meaning looks. He was not surprised, for members made no"
"scruple of reading their papers or writing their letters in the House,"
"but he was vexed to see that he had not gripped them closer. He went on,"
but that ever-circulating paper had half his attention now. He noticed
Kilshaw come in with it and press it on Sir Robert's notice. Sir Robert
"at first refused, but when Kilshaw urged, he read and glanced up at him,"
"so Medland thought, with a look of sadness. Coxon had got a paper now,"
"and left biting his nails to pore over it; he passed it to Puttock, and"
"the fat man bulged his cheeks in seeming wonder. Even his waverer, the"
"one who had cheered, was deep in it. Only Norburn was unconscious of it."
This same lady was always terribly distressed when she had to order a
"fowl to be killed for her husband's breakfast, even if she had never"
"seen it before. I have seen her, after telling the cook to kill a fowl"
"for breakfast, run away and sit down in the veranda with her hands over"
"her ears, and her face the very picture of misery, fearing lest she"
should hear its shrieks. I think that this was the one great trouble to
"her in her marriage, that her husband would insist on eating fowls and"
"ducks, and that she had to order them to be killed."
"As she is, so are most Burmans. If there is all this trouble about"
"fowls, it can be imagined how the trouble increases when it comes to"
goats or any larger beasts. In the jungle villages meat of any kind at
all is never seen: no animals of any kind are allowed to be killed. An
officer travelling in the district would be reduced to what he could
"carry with him, if it were not for an Act of Government obliging"
"villages to furnish--on payment, of course--supplies for officers and"
troops passing through. The mere fact of such a law being necessary is
sufficient proof of the strength of the feeling against taking life.
"Of course, all shooting, either for sport or for food, is looked upon as"
disgraceful. In many jungle villages where deer abound there are one or
two hunters who make a living by hunting. But they are disgraced men.
"They are worse than fishermen, and they will have a terrible penalty to"
pay for it all. It will take much suffering to wash from their souls the
"cruelty, the blood-thirstiness, the carelessness to suffering, the"
"absence of compassion, that hunting must produce. 'Is there no food in"
"the bazaar, that you must go and take the lives of animals?' has been"
"said to me many a time. And when my house-roof was infested by sparrows,"
"who dropped grass and eggs all over my rooms, so that I was obliged to"
"shoot them with a little rifle, this was no excuse. 'You should have"
"built a sparrow-cote,' they told me. 'If you had built a sparrow-cote,"
they would have gone away and left you in peace. They only wanted to
years. For something approaching half a century a woman maintained the
"Michigan City harbour light on the Great Lake of that name. Indeed,"
the associations were so deep-rooted and long that the beacon became
"popularly known as “Miss Colfax’s light,” after the name of its keeper."
Even when she attained the age of eighty years she was as active and
"attentive to her charge as on the day, in 1861, when she first assumed"
responsibility for its safe-keeping.
In those times there was a beacon established on the end of the wooden
"pier, which railed off an area of the restless lake for the purposes of"
"the inland port. Those were strenuous days. Her home was on shore, and"
every night and morning she tramped the long arm of woodwork to light
"and extinguish the lamp. Lard-oil was used, and during the winter the"
food for the lamp had to be heated to bring it into a fluid condition
before she set out from home. It was no easy matter struggling along on
"a blusterous, gusty evening, with a pail of hot oil in one hand and a"
"lamp in the other, over a narrow plank. Often, when a gale was raging,"
progress was so slow that by the time the beacon was reached the oil
"had cooled and congealed, rendering it a difficult matter to induce"
"the lamp to burn. Once set going, however, it was safe for the night,"
as the heat radiated from the burner kept the lard melted. In addition
"to this lamp, there was another light in the tower projecting from the"
"roof of her house, which had to be maintained, and this, being the main"
"light, was the more important of the two."
In 1886 the pier tower was taken out of her hands for ever. A furious
"gale, such as is peculiar to these inland seas, and which cannot be"
"rivalled on the ocean for fury, was raging. At dusk she started on her"
"usual journey. Time after time she was wellnigh swept off her feet, so"
"that she staggered rather than walked, for the spray and sand flecking"
"her face nearly blinded her. When she gained the tower she paused, and"
"observed that it was trembling violently. Undismayed, she ascended, lit"
"about 40 years of age at the time of his death. He was remarkable, even"
"among his remarkable companions, for several things. First of all, he only"
drank tea--thus being the only total abstainer known to the fraternity.
"Also he was a strict disciplinarian, and on board his ships all lights had"
"to be extinguished by 8 p.m., any of the crew who wished to continue"
drinking after that hour had to do so on the open deck. But try as he
would this ardent apostle of abstemiousness was unable to put down
"drinking. If Roberts had lived to-day, no doubt he would have been on the"
council of the local vigilance committee. He would allow no women aboard
"his ships, in fact he made it a law that any man who brought a woman on"
board disguised as a man was to suffer death. Roberts allowed no games at
"cards or dice to be played for money, as he strongly disapproved of"
"gambling. He was a strict Sabbatarian, and allowed the musicians to have a"
"rest on the seventh day. This was as well, for the post of musician on a"
"pirate ship was no sinecure, as every pirate had the right to demand a"
tune at any hour of the day or night. He used to place a guard to protect
"all his women prisoners, and it is sadly suspicious that there was always"
the greatest competition amongst the worst characters in the ship to be
appointed sentinel over a good-looking woman prisoner. All quarrels had to
"be settled on shore, pirate fashion, the duellists standing back to back"
armed with pistol and cutlass. Roberts would have no fighting among the
crew on board his ship.
Bartholomew must have looked the very part of a pirate when dressed for
"action. A tall, dark man, he used to wear a rich damask waistcoat and"
"breeches, a red feather in his cap, a gold chain round his neck with a"
"large diamond cross dangling from it, a sword in his hand, and two pairs"
of pistols hanging at the end of a silk sling flung over his shoulders.
"We first hear of Roberts as sailing, in honest employ, as master of the"
"_Princess_ (Captain Plumb), from London in November, 1719, bound for the"
"coast of Guinea to pick up a cargo of ""black ivory"" at Anamaboe. Here his"
to whatever is harsh and inharmonious. He calls it 'a certain occult
natural sense' which makes him abhor strife. He cannot abide being at
"loggerheads with anyone. He always hoped and wanted, he says, to keep"
"his pen unbloody, to attack no one, to provoke no one, even if he were"
"attacked. But his enemies had not willed it, and in later years he"
"became well accustomed to bitter polemics, with Lefèvre d'Étaples, with"
"Lee, with Egmondanus, with Hutten, with Luther, with Beda, with the"
"Spaniards, and the Italians. At first it is still noticeable how he"
"suffers by it, how contention wounds him, so that he cannot bear the"
"pain in silence. 'Do let us be friends again,' he begs Lefèvre, who does"
not reply. The time which he had to devote to his polemics he regards as
"lost. 'I feel myself getting more heavy every day,' he writes in 1520,"
'not so much on account of my age as because of the restless labour of
"my studies, nay more even by the weariness of disputes than by the work,"
"which, in itself, is agreeable.' And how much strife was still in store"
for him then!
If only Erasmus had been less concerned about public opinion! But that
"seemed impossible: he had a fear of men, or, we may call it, a fervent"
"need of justification. He would always see beforehand, and usually in"
"exaggerated colours, the effect his word or deed would have upon men. Of"
"himself, it was certainly true as he once wrote: that the craving for"
fame has less sharp spurs than the fear of ignominy. Erasmus is with
"Rousseau among those who cannot bear the consciousness of guilt, out of"
a sort of mental cleanliness. Not to be able to repay a benefit with
"interest, makes him ashamed and sad. He cannot abide 'dunning creditors,"
"unperformed duty, neglect of the need of a friend'. If he cannot"
"discharge the obligation, he explains it away. The Dutch historian Fruin"
has quite correctly observed: 'Whatever Erasmus did contrary to his duty
and his rightly understood interests was the fault of circumstances or
wrong advice; he is never to blame himself'. And what he has thus
justified for himself becomes with him universal law: 'God relieves
He did not try to analyze the strange feelings which possessed him.  For
a time he did not even consciously think.  He seemed to be drifting
"along a shining pathway—drifting, he scarce knew whither, and did not"
"care to ask.  His heart was strangely heavy, and yet strangely light.  A"
curious loathing and shame at himself was blended with a sense of
"exultant triumph, which held him in a mood of ecstasy.  For a long while"
"he drifted onwards, scarce thinking or knowing whither he went, till a"
sudden consciousness that he was passing Lord Sandford’s house brought
him to himself with a sense of shock. He had left that house only two
hours before; yet it might have been as many years that had rolled over
"his head, so different were his feelings, so changed was his outlook"
upon life.
"He moored his boat, and went up to his room. Before long he would be"
"expected to drink coffee or chocolate at his friend’s levee, meet all"
those of his comrades who had energy to pay their customary _devoirs_ to
"their patron, and discuss the plans for the ensuing day and night.  Grey"
"dashed some cold water over his hot head, and sat down to think."
What would Lord Sandford say if he suddenly expressed his intention of
"giving up gambling in all its many insidious forms, in order to enter"
upon a life totally different from that of the past weeks? It was not as
though he had any alternative plan to unfold to him.  He was as ignorant
"how his fortune was to be made now, after several weeks in gay London"
"town, as he had been on his first approach to that city.  He could"
almost hear the great guffaw of laughter with which Lord Sandford would
greet his confession.  He half feared the powerful personality and the
"imperious temper of the man who had been a good friend to him, and who"
had the reputation of being a dangerous enemy when his will was crossed.
Grey knew that this man liked him—went near to loving him—would not
easily let him go.  He knew that he would appear both ungrateful and
capricious; and the young man writhed at the thought of seeming either
Miscellanies.... We are in the presence of holy things; here it is no
"question of eloquence, these matters are best recommended to the world"
by simplicity and purity; it would be ridiculous to display human
"erudition here, impious to pride oneself on human eloquence.' But"
Erasmus never was so eloquent himself as just then.
What here raises him above his usual level of force and fervour is the
"fact that he fights a battle, the battle for the right of biblical"
criticism. It revolts him that people should study Holy Scripture in the
"Vulgate when they know that the texts show differences and are corrupt,"
although we have the Greek text by which to go back to the original form
and primary meaning.
"He is now reproached because he dares, as a mere grammarian, to assail"
the text of Holy Scripture on the score of futile mistakes or
"irregularities. 'Details they are, yes, but because of these details we"
sometimes see even great divines stumble and rave.' Philological
"trifling is necessary. 'Why are we so precise as to our food, our"
"clothes, our money-matters and why does this accuracy displease us in"
"divine literature alone? He crawls along the ground, they say, he"
wearies himself out about words and syllables! Why do we slight any word
"of Him whom we venerate and worship under the name of the Word? But, be"
it so! Let whoever wishes imagine that I have not been able to achieve
"anything better, and out of sluggishness of mind and coldness of heart"
or lack of erudition have taken this lowest task upon myself; it is
still a Christian idea to think all work good that is done with pious
"zeal. We bring along the bricks, but to build the temple of God.'"
He does not want to be intractable. Let the Vulgate be kept for use in
"the liturgy, for sermons, in schools, but he who, at home, reads our"
"edition, will understand his own the better in consequence. He, Erasmus,"
is prepared to render account and acknowledge himself to have been wrong
"big tree had been felled, its bark stripped in the middle of the trunk"
"in a large square, and the soft, fleshy interior laid open. There were"
three men standing in a row before it and pounding away at it. A few
"more men waited to relieve the tired ones. The pounding instruments,"
"half club, half adzes, had thick but not very broad blades of green"
"stone, of the same type as I have seen among the Mailu natives of"
the South Coast. [79]
The pulp was then carried in baskets to a neighbouring stream. At
"this spot there was a natural trough, one of the big, convex scales,"
"which form the basis of the sago leaf. In the middle of it, a sieve"
"was made of a piece of coco-nut spathing, a fibre which covers the"
"root of a coco-nut leaf, and looks at first sight exactly like a"
piece of roughly woven material. Water was directed so that it flowed
"into the trough at its broad end, coming out at the narrow one. The"
"sago pulp was put at the top, the water carried away with it the"
"powdered sago starch, while the wooden, husky fibres were retained"
by the sieve. The starch was then carried with the water into a big
"wooden canoe-shaped trough; there the heavier starch settled down,"
"while the water welled over the brim. When there is plenty of starch,"
the water is drained off carefully and the starch is placed into
"another of the trough-shaped, sago leaf bases, where it is allowed to"
"dry. In such receptacles it is then carried on a trading expedition,"
and is thus counted as one unit of sago.
I watched the proceedings for a long time with great interest. There is
"something fascinating about the big, antideluvian-looking sago palm,"
"so malignant and unapproachable in its unhealthy, prickly swamp,"
being turned by man into food by such simple and direct methods. The
"sago produced and eaten by the natives is a tough, starchy stuff, of"
"dirty white colour, very unpalatable. It has the consistency of rubber,"
"and the taste of very poor, unleavened bread. It is not clear, like"
"And remember that when the world is in conflagration, this corner which"
"has hitherto escaped it, will not evade the peril which threatens it."
The march of disaster will then be terribly rapid. You have soon to
prepare yourself against any hostile sides. You can only withstand it if
the whole people realise the imminent danger. You can by your thought
and by your action awaken and influence the multitude. Do not have any
misgivings about the want of long previous preparations. Have you not
already seen how mind triumphs over matter and have not some of you with
only a few months' preparation stood fearless at your post in
Mesopotamia and won recognition by your calm collectedness and true
"heroism? They may say that you are but a small handful, what of the vast"
illiterate millions? Illiterate in what sense? Have not the ballads of
these illiterates rendered into English by our Poet touched profoundly
the hearts of the very elect of the West? Have not the stories of their
common life appealed to the common kinship of humanity? If you still
have some doubts about the power of the multitude to respond instantly
"to the call of duty, I shall relate an incident which came within my own"
personal experience. I had gone on a scientific expedition to the
borders of the Himalayan terrai of Kumaun; a narrow ravine was between
me and the plateau on the other side. Terror prevailed among the
villagers on the other side of the ravine; for a tigress had come down
from the forest. And numerous had been the toll in human lives exacted.
Petitions had been sent up to the Government and questions had been
asked in Parliament. A reward of Rs. 500 had been offered. Various
"captains in the army with battery of guns came many a time, but the"
reward remained unclaimed. The murderess of the forest would come out
even in broad day-light and leisurely take her victims from away their
companions. Nothing could circumvent her demoniac cunning. When all
"hopes had nearly vanished, the villagers went to Kaloo Singh, who"
possessed an old matchlock. At the special sanction of the Magistrate he
was allowed to buy a quantity of gunpowder; the bullets he himself made
"iguanas in the jungle, the fish in the river and the yams and bananas in"
the clearing needed no silver to come to his table. Besides he was
"preparing to become a man of family. Maria was quite willing, and so one"
day they strolled off together hand in hand to a clearing Miguel had
made with his machete on the river bank. With that same useful tool he
"cut some wooden posts, set them erect in the ground and covered them"
with a heavy thatch of palmetto leaves impervious to sun or rain. The
sides of the shelter were left open during the first months of wedded
"life. Later perhaps, when they had time they would go to Cruces at the"
period of the priest’s regular visit and get regularly married. When the
rainy season came on and walls were as necessary as a roof against the
"driving rain, they would build a little better. When that time came he"
would set ten stout uprights of bamboo in the ground in the shape of an
"oblong, and across the tops would fasten six cross pieces of girders"
with withes of vine well soaked to make them pliable. This would make
the frame of the first floor of his house. The walls he would make by
"weaving reeds, or young bamboo stalks in and out betwixt the posts until"
a fairly tight basketwork filled the space. This was then plastered
"outside with clay. The dirt, which in time would be stamped down hard,"
formed the floor. For his second story a tent-shaped frame of lighter
"bamboo tightly tied together was fastened to the posts, and cane was"
tied to each of the rafters as we nail laths to scantling. Thus a strong
"peaked roof, about eight feet high from the second floor to the"
"ridgepole was constructed, and thatched with palm leaves. Its angle"
being exceedingly steep it sheds water in the fierce tropic rain storms.
"The floor of the second story is made of bamboo poles laid transversely,"
and covered heavily with rushes and palmetto. This is used only as the
"family sleeping apartment, and to give access to it Miguel takes an"
"8-inch bamboo and cuts notches in it, into which the prehensile toes of"
his family may fit as they clamber up to the land of Nod. Furniture to
the chamber floor there is none. The family herd together like so many
"squirrels, and with the bamboo climbing pole drawn up there is no danger"
- No.
- Where can I wait for him?
"- Encore dehors, pas rentré."
Can I wait?

Gave it to you?
"It's true, you don't believe me?"
Grab him
"Hey, don't move!"
You really want to fight?
"Kid, you do know some kung fu!"
This kid must be the apprentice of Zhou Sanzhao
We'll take him to Thunderstorm!
"Wait, Thunderstorm is my Master!"
How come he has an apprentice like you?
Who's that?
Who are you looking for?
Master Shi

It's Gao Jian!
"Gao Jian, what happened?"
"Master, I...they..."
What exactly has happened?

"All right, all right, all right."
"Good morning, sir."
"Take it easy, will you?"
Just plug them in there.
Leon:
"Yeah, like Batboy."
- Can we Batboy him?
- Ugh.
Who cares?
Whatever.
"I don't vote, I think it's annoying."
- Sylvie.
- Hey.
"Hey, Ricky."
"- Hi, Ricky."
"Hey, any news?"
"- Uh, look, guys."
I've had everybody in the department looking for Pete.
"You know, I mean, I've got someone in every precinct."
"We put out a silver alert, even though he's not old enough, we got his picture everywhere."
- That's great.
- Been checking even tri-state departments.
- Wow.
- Friends up in New Jersey state.
"I mean, we've looked everywhere, guys."
Nothing.
Nothing's turning up.
He ain't been to see Trisha.
Nothing.
"Not a lead, or a story about someone seeing him."
Nothing.
"I mean, Iâm sorry, but we're striking out."
"- Well, thank you."
Thanks for all that.
That's--
- Yeah.
[Muffled Screaming]
Quiet.
Quiet.

[Man] You are being read into the Have Blue program.
This is a top-secret U.S. Government project... administered by the Department of Defense.
You must have some pretty powerful friends to get us here on a Sunday.
To get us here at all.
We're not supposed to be talking about this to anyone.
Not even our wives.
They have people watching our wives.
You know that?
Making sure we haven't blabbed to them.
"Well, I'm the guy that's gonna make sure that you don't."
- Could be a bad thing.
- Tara!
"See ya on ""Trisha""."
I was thinking of asking you to speak at the school.
Speak?
About drugs.
Speak about drugs?
To the kids.
Speak to the kids about drugs?
They need to hear about the harsh realities 'cause... people talk so much shit about drugs.
Yeah.
I know I do.
Half your sixth form come round here anyway.
You could call a register here some weeks.
"Ah, now, that's another good topic."
What's it like working from home?
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
"Well, the hours are terrible, but then I hardly do owt."
So it balances itself out.
"Jesus! ""Hellraiser III:"

Miss.
- How are you both?
- Wicked.
Due to serious setbacks to our troops in Guantanamo and Santiago my position in Cuba is untenable.
I am resigning from office to avoid further bloodshed.
And I shall leave the city immediately.
I wish all of you good luck.
Salud!
Viva la revolución!
Viva Fidel!
Fredo!
Come on.
Come with me.
It's the only way out of here tonight.
Roth is dead.
"Fredo, come with me!"
You're still my brother.
Fredo!
"I'm Pat Geary, United States Senator."
Fidel!
Fidel!
Fidel!
Al.
Get me a wet towel.
Does Kay know I'm back?
My boy?
Did you get him something for Christmas?
-I took care of it.
"-What was it, so I'll know."
It was a little car with an electric motor that he can ride in.
It's nice.
"Thank you, Al."
"Fellows, could you step outside for a minute?"
Where's my brother?
Roth got out on a private boat.
I can see you're attaching electrodes to the boy's chest.
What are those for?
"- What are those for, Dr. Ross?"
- Patch me through to County.
Dr. Ross has just asked me to patch him through to County General.
- You need a red key.
- Look out for the Lost Soul.
- Use the rocket launcher.
- Mount Sinai's shooting us.
- They're cheaters!
Get them!
- You do it!
- I need a bulletproof vest.
- Blast him with a BFG 9000!
"Look, his guts are all over the place!"
"Quiet, you guys."
This is County General.
Go ahead.
This is Chopper Five from Channel Five News.
We've got a Dr. Ross flying in a hypothermic kid.
- Doug Ross?
- That is correct.
"Hold on, Chopper Five."
"Mark, Doug is on a news chopper bringing in a hypothermic kid."
- What?
- It's on the MICN.
- What's he doing on a news chopper?
"- Look, there's Dr. Ross."
- Turn up the volume.
- Where's the remote?
"Doug, do you read me?"
"- Mark, is that you?"
"- You know, mooning about."
"Daydreaming, singing to herself."
"You haven't noticed, hmm?"
"Oh, well, I..."
- Sebastian?
- Hmm?
I know you've been keeping something from me.
[Gulps] Keeping something?
About Ariel?
- Ariel?
"- In love, hmm?"
"[Whimpers] I tried to stop her, sir!"
She wouldn't listen!
I told her to stay away from humans!
They are bad!
- They are trouble!
- Humans?
What about humans?
Humans?
[chuckles nervously]
Who said anything about humans?
[yelps]
"Flounder, why can't you just tell me what this is all about?"
"Flounder, why can't you just tell me what this is all about?"
You'll see.
It's a surprise.
"Oh, Flounder."
"Flounder, you're the best!"
It looks just like him.
It even has his eyes.
"[Giggles] Why, Eric, run away with you?"
"Oh, this is all so... so sudden."
"Porter, have you heard of her?"
Exactly.
Nouveau riche.
"- Excuse me, Gunther."
- Mm-hmm.
- What's down that way?
- That wing is forbidden for a woman like you.
Oh.
This way.
This is a... this spot's reserved.
"- Oh, anywhere is fine."
- Oh...
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
"If you need any... anything at all, you..."
Oh.
Thank you.

I apologize for the unorthodox introduction.
I'm Dr. Cairn.
- Oh.

"- Oh, yes."
The institute is...
lovely.
- I'm happy that you're pleased.
You may be feeling stress.
So... this tonic may calm your nerves.
How are you responding to the tonic?
- I feel better already.
You're an unreliable father.
I did it foryou!
I'II shame you all over the whole Po valley!
"And besides, Maria doesn't seem to have a moustache!"
"You haven't had breakfast, your cup's here."
- I have to talk to you.
- Get me the colander?
.
- I'd Iike you to listen to me.
- I'm listenin'.
- I've made a decision.
- Good foryou.
"Don't interrupt me, I've got the whole speech right here."
will you get me two eggs forthe zabagIione?
- seriously.
- I heard you.
Do you want this zabagIione?
I'II even put marsaIa in it.
MarsaIa?
"- So, I'm off."
- See you at the festival.
We won't be needing you anymore.
I'm sorry about yourwife.
"That's life, don't worry."
- Did you talk to yourmother?
.
- She understood everything.
- How do you know?
- She made zabagIione.
"With marsaIa, when she uses that..."
She understands.
"Maria's pretty, isn't she?"
Leave?
"They want to drink, my friends."
They want to hear music and gamble.
And where's the only place they can do that?
I give you the Standish Tavern.
I can hear the jingle of the cash box now.
"Come along, gentlemen, let's inspect our private gold mine."
[chattering ] [WOMAN shouting ]
"Jeez, Ezra, you sure are right about this place."
Excitement's over yonder.
"Hey, Buck."
What's all the commotion?
Poker.
High stakes.
"Old Gundersson, he's losing his shirt, but he's not backing down."
I think you better take a look at this.
GUNDERSSON:
I call.
[CROWD groaning ]
"Yeah, that's it."
"I'm wiped out, sure."
You own the place.

We've been waiting...
Madame Sand.
Pardon.

Madame Sand is on her way up.
Don't do that!
(whistles) It is rather far.
"- I'II have to face her, that's all."
- alfred!
I'II be perfectly behaved.
Even a little scornful.
"No, you won't."
You'II be impossible.
I don't want a scene.
Now get in there.
And hurry up!
"hello, George!"
I wasn't expecting you till next month.
"- How are the children, the country?"
- Fine.
Listen.
"I need another 3,000 francs."
What happened to the advance you got?
You know my expenses.
"The children, the estate, my mother's nursing home..."
The divorce took half of everything.
AII right.
But let me have one more instalment first.
(LAUGHING)
"Never mind him, he's mad."
Come along.
(WHISPERING)
Stayne!
(BANDERSNATCH BREATHING HEAVILY)
(GROWLING)
I suppose this makes us even now.
Um forced herself on me.
"I told her my heart belongs to you, but she's obsessed with me."
Off with her head!
"Stand back, Mallymkun."
How's this for muchness?
"No, no!"
It mustn't be used for anything...
Arrest that girl for unlawful seduction!
Hatter!
-Take it to the White Queen.
-I'm not leaving without you.
Go!
"Run, Alice!"
Alice?
Run!
Seize her.
Alice.
Of course.
Why didn't I see it?
"Well, it has been a long time, and you were such a little tyke then."
-Give me the sword.
-Stay back.
The Queen will be so pleased.
She will take great pleasure in taking off your head.

I've got a job for you.
Mickey's not well.
He's lost his mojo.
He'll lose his life if he keeps that woman.
"Take her away, do it for me."
"If Mickey's not chirpy, he's no good."
I don't want him!
I want him to go!
The Prime Minister amended a few things.
"By the way, firm handshake is customary in Turkey."
It's so short now.
Brussels insisted on being brief.
"Apparently, after my speech in Scotland."
I thought I improvised well.
Very well.
"Carlos, please."
"Sire, I think you should refrain from comments."
Excuse me.
Your Majesty?
Of course.
I'll take care of it.
I will see to it.
I will.
"Goodbye, Your Majesty."
"Sire, the press conference in Miniatürk starts at 11 a.m."
"Your speech, Sire."
The Prime Minister amended a few things.
"By the way, firm handshake is customary in Turkey."
Thank you.
Perfect.
It's time.
"We should go, Sire."
It's really small.
The Atomium?
That's a flop.
No.
"Well, yes."
Look at the tiny space for the European monuments...
As if Europe is Turkey's annex.
Mr. Moreau.
I think I'm understanding you better.
Must be my ear.
"No, you're understanding us with yourheart."
Now you're a poet.
Just a manner of speaking!

"We're dead, I see Saint CostabiIe!"
"Two fruitjuices, please."
Have we learned to say no?
"Keep moving, nothing happened."
Nothing happened is what I say!
"Tortora, the handcuffs!"
hello?
Love?
"I can't come tonight, maybe tomorrow."
Why?
I'm at the local police Station.
You were mugged?
"No, I went into a bar and they arrested me."
- Why?
- I went in on a motorbike!
Are you alright?
- Have you been drinking?
- No.
- You're drunk!
- A local fruitjuice.
"I've been thinking about this, I'm coming down tomorrow."
No!
"You can't, it's dangerous."
I'II show you dangerous!
"My friends,"
-
- Could you turn your vacuum cleaner down?
-
- What?
-
- Shouldn't you wear a vest?
-
- You what?
-
- Never mind.
Go back to automatic pilot.
-- (MUSIC GOES THROUGH HEADPHONES) -
- Thank God they've gone!
"""Shouldn't he wear a vest""!"
Huh!
-
"- Vests are out, man."
-
- Yours is.
I can see it from here.
-
- Let me handle this.
-
"- I wish you would, Granville."
Hi!
"Something we can do for you, man?"
Don't listen to the golden oldie here.
"He's, like, from yesterday."
"You and me, we know where it's at, right?"
"By the way, love the open shirt."
"That's very me, the open shirt."
Soon as I get out of this clobber I'm straight into the open shirt.
There you go.
Thanks.
This looks good on me.
You think?
I look completely different from yesterday.
But don't you think this is hard on Takao and Shinako?
I have to think about them later.
Why don't you come to rehearsals?
"The performance is coming up, you know."
I think I'm going to quit dancing.
Why?
"This place might close, too."
Really?
I just came from your place.
I found Kayama-sensei.
Where is he?
He's in Okutama.
It looks like he's pretty sick.
He might not know who you are.
"Brother, brother."
Sensei.
"It's me, Shinako."
Do you remember who I am?
"Shinako, dance."
Dance!
"As long as you have legs, dance"
Ballerinas dance until they die.
Can you hear that?
It's a festival.
A gypsy dance.
People with legs should dance.
Ballerinas...ballerinas dance.
Listen in on his conversation.
He said it was a friendly dinner.
No way.
Not a chance.
"Tell them, Bobbi."
"- Let""s not jump to any conclusions."
- What?
Do you have a picture of the receptionist?
"No, but she has blonde hair, like Clara."
"Like Mom""s."
"Yeah, well, she""s thinner than me... and she""s prettier."
Is this your daughter?
"She""s so pretty."
Yeah.
"That""s my oldest daughter, Cassie."
"She""s getting married."
A wedding.
You must be so excited.
Yeah.
We are.
We really are.
"Now, how long has this scumbag been sneaking around?"
"We""ve known about it for a couple of weeks."
"Clara can""t sleep, she can""t eat."
"L""m worried about you, Mom."
"We""ll get even for y""all."
"Won""t we, Bobbi?"
"We""ll nail that lying, cheating bastard to the wall."
"We""ll rake him over the coals."
"And when we""re done with David Harris... he""ll wish he never stepped foot outside your bedroom door."
"- Do you love him, Clara?"
"- What""s love got to do with anything?"
"And because I was kind of black, you think you can dump me."
What the hell.

"Hey, June!"
Junie!
How you doing?
You got something for me?
"How you doing, Mr. Charlie?"
"Hello, is this Ronnie?"
"Ronnie, this is Ray."
"Listen, is Fantasia there?"
"Yeah, Lila."
Where is she?
"Well, have you got a number out there for her?"
"Yeah, listen, give it to me, all right?"
Yeah.
Ronnie?
"Ronnie, come here."
Ma'am?
Come here.
I got to go.
"Ronnie, now, if you know something about Lila being here, you tell these gentlemen."
"Your sister's in trouble, but I don't want you being in trouble."
"No, ma'am."
I don't know nothing about that.
"Ronnie, June Hawkins down the street just told me he was out most of the night digging frogs south of town."
"When he was driving back, he saw you driving along in front him, and Byron, he was with you."
"Now, where had you and Byron been at 4:00 in the morning?"
Vibrant!
Superb!
So glad to hear it!
"- Tony, are you OK?"
"- I'm top-notch, buddy."
Enjoying your night out?
Me too.
"Hey, Nips."
"- Don't call her Nips, Tony."
"- Why, what you gonna do?"
"I'm, uh, objecting."
Strongly.
- Come on...
"- Tony, what are you doing?"
"Isn't she pretty, hey man?"
Tony.
You two make such a sweet couple!
Out of all the world's famous lovers
- Anthony and Cleopatra...
"Taylor and Burton, Jordan and Peter..."
Stop it.
Bert and Ernie...
I would say that you two are quite possibly the greatest snog history has so far encountered.
"What is wrong with you, Tony?"
Are you OK?
What is it with you people and the concept of OK?
"I mean, we're a fucking threesome, aren't we?"
You know... peas in a pod.
"A fucking family, that's what we are."
D'you need to sit down?
Just calm down.
No...
-Otherwise you are very nice.
-To your health.
"When our official delegation comes here, we will bring you a decoration."
You golden boy!
I will mount the little horse...
Sing with me.
When I join the army
Everyone!
"And you, my dear"
-Call me Pepa.
"-Hi, Pepa."
-What should I call you?
"-Whatever you like, Pepa."
"-For example, can I call you monster?"
"-You can, Pepa."
-And I will also call you monster.
"-Call me monster 2,"
-so there's order in it.
"-Bye, monsters."
"Bye, Pepa."
"Boys, I like you."
Yirinka!
These are my friends from space.
"Nice to meet you, I'm the princess of Monaco."
They are just flying back.
Cheers.
"-Cheers, Pepa."
"-Cheers, monsters."
Well?
Do they congratulate us?
I'm looking forward to going home.
"We'll get bonuses, I'll buy new aquarium, feed the fish, and have peace and quiet."
Until when are you going to be like this?
We're not rich enough to take care of a shut-in!
"Since you graduated already, start helping out with the store already!"
Yeah.
Souta-kun.
I love Bonheur's chocolates the most in the whole world.

Eh?

Huh?

That's impossible.
"I admit that it's unreasonable, but - after coming all the way here, I can't just go back."
"Ah, if you want, I can talk directly to the mana-"
Wait!

We'll take this.
-Give me one too.
-Open your own.
Horror!
"Don't let these two out, they don't have any ID."
-I'll call the police.
-Don't do it!
"Hold on please, I will explain!"
Beat it!
"Doctor, what about the mineral water?"
They are not from here.
They're from a different galaxy.
I mean from the agricultural co-operative Galaxy.
Such a small village.
Never in their life have they seen a big supermarket.

"Sure, he's famous now,"

Didn't know what he was doing.
"But he only uses his powers for good, never for evil."
Remember that.
"Oh, that's Atomo, the metal menace."
He's not the hero.
He's the villain.
He's not like you.

"It is burning, Ivan Semenovich!"
Thanks a lot.

"No, not me."
Mytime is ahead.

"We plan not a wedding, but a farewell party."
And I seem to be ready to marry any stranger.
-Malakhov!
Take it!
"-Yes, sir!"
Go to our positions quickly.
I'll followyou.
I will not lose a drop.
Your security officer captain Shulgin visited me and asked a lot of questions.
It is hisjob.
The war is around.
We are in the front line.
At least the dimensions are stabilised.
"""8-9."
"""9-A."
"-""E-7..."""
-E-9.
"Sorry, E-9."
"""2-3..."" Wait!"
Wait!
Did you say E-9?
"Look, it says E-7 there."
You're right.
And the next three numbers are wrong.
This way.
"The Tardis isn't much use to anybody that size, stable or not."
-It gives us time.
-Time to do what?
We don't even know if he's alive in there.
They've arrested the dimension spiral.
Things are looking up.
This is the street.
The error should be somewhere here.
-Sabotage.
-Murder.
Interfering with the working of Logopolis.
The most dangerous crime in the universe.
An error in the dimension subroutine.
Somewhere here.
I will not be beaten.
I simply will not be beaten.
But I could certainly do with a little more help from outside.
"We must return to the Central Register, quickly."
The Monitor's done it.
I told him that it was an interesting idea.
That's the funniest thing I've ever heard.

Can you imagine that motherfucker roaming around Parker center?

He'd put a stopper in the bottle.

Put a stopper in the bottle.

FERN:
"Hurricane, what are you doing back there?"
You know no one's supposed to be back there.
"Just getting a candy bar, Fern."
You going to pay for it this time?
"Hi, boys."
I saw your car parked out front.
Charlie come to relieve me about a half hour ago.
Dud?
I didn't mean to put you on the spot this morning.
"(RADIO SQUAWKS) Listen, Dale, we didn't mean..."
"Oh, that's me."
"Yeah, this is 2-10, go ahead."
LARRY:
"Hurricane, I just got back from Little Rock with that picture."
10-4.
That's us.
You leave it?
Yeah.
"Jimmy, you got it?"
Set your perimeter!
- It's still alive!
- Shoot at it!

Let's get him in the car.
"Drive, baby, drive!"
Step on it!

It's gaining on us.
Faster!
Faster!
Hurry!
(SOLDIERS YELLING INDISTINCTLY)
All battleships fire at the robot!
Now!
"Now, damn it, now!"
Nothing can stop this thing!
We've hit it with everything we've got!
"Not everything, General."
The bomb.
The Nautilus has first strike capability and is not far offshore.
"You scare me, Mansley."
You want us to bomb ourselves in order to kill it?
"General, the giant seems to follow whatever attacks it."
"We can lure it away from the town, then destroy it."
Radio the Nautilus.
We'd better go back to the Doctor.
-Where did you get that?
-It's too small for me.
-What is it?
-It's a present.
-I've been trying to get it off.
-Who from?
-I hope you haven't broken it.
-Nyssa.
"Adric, Nyssa, come on."
Doctor!
I don't want you two chasing after the Master independently.
"You, Adric, should know how dangerous he is."
-That's the man who brought me from Traken.
-Yes.
He said he was a friend of yours.
-But he's the man on the bridge.
-Yes.
-You said to be prepared for the worst.
"-Indeed I did, and I am prepared for the worst."
"Why are you prepared for the worst, Doctor?"
Because he's here.
Please remain where you are.
I have it in my power to bring Logopolis to a complete halt.
There's much more to this block transfer computation than we thought.
"Yes, that's how they built a replica of the Pharos Project."
"Yes, yes, but why?"
Hmm?
Why build a replica of the Pharos Project?

I'm happy you are here.

This is the last dispatch from Havas news agency:
"""The findings made on the trunk of the Munich-Paris train led to the discovery of a fingerprint left by Jacques Dollon, the man wanted for the murder of the Baroness de Vibray and the theft from the Princess Danidoff."""
This is madness!
I'm going crazy!
Not now!
"I need sensational stuff, so sort it out yourself."
Go!
"Hello, Fandor."
Good morning.
She was in her room.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
- How are you?
- Better.
I find it peaceful here.
I got your message.
What's wrong?
"Ah, yes."
I read your article on the princess Danidoff.
I 'm sure now:
Her name was on the list with the date of April 12.
"Sorry to bother you, but someone is asking for Miss Elizabeth on the phone."
Anyone know you are here?
"No, just you."
I can accompany you?
"Yeah, sure."
Hello?

While we do this work.
And then we're gonna light him on fire.

"Every time I've done these, they've been really horrible,"
So-- INTERVIEWER:

"Yeah, I'm not really optimistic."
"But, you know, we'll see."

All right.
I'll make a dollar bet saying that this sucks.

It was kind of nice having a roommate.

I hope you have a better plan than that.
It's all about misdirection.
I don't wanna show my hand too early.
"Well, the two of you have had enough misdirection."
"Trust me, show your hand."
"Move your toes, Trina."
Good.
- O-neg's here.
- Put it right on the infuser.
"Trina, do you remember anything?"

"- Trina, how many of them were there?"
"Two, in an SUV."
I saw them drive up.
- Another 50 of fent.
- Knife back.
- Curved Kelly.
- I might have seen them getting away.
Anything more specific?
"It was a 4x4, gold or tan maybe."
It looked pretty new.
Anything about the men?
Height?
Pretty...
Pretty... every one said...
But...
The taste of people change in any moment...
What is out of fashion is thrown in the drawer and never used.
Hey...
Am I Pretty?
What a soft feeling!
Although it's a little worn out
It's ok!
I'll borrow them!
Beautiful.
I'm just a traveler passing by.
Lost my way under the rain.
It's seems I entered your house without permission.
I'm sorry.
Will you let me go out soon?
That's a very nasty smell.
Even here it's all battered.
Up to be thrown in the dump indeed.
"But, before that..."
I won't forget...
"Before becoming useless, were wonderfully useful to people..."
Good work.

There are people looking for him.
"If anyone should come inquiring, I'd appreciate if you'd give me a call."
"It's a mater of national security, you see?"
-Okay.
-Thank you.
Are you feeling better?
You gonna tell me what happened?
-Not now.
-Okay.
-What time is it?
-It's... uh... half past three.
- We need to go.
- Where?
- We're meeting someone.
- Who?
-A friend.
- You mentioned that there were six of you.
Where are the others?
-Gone.
Yeah.
Chelsea.
Colin.
Colin?
Let's go!
Morning.
Tell Casey I'm sorry.
It sounded like I woke the baby.
He's cutting his first tooth.
Nobody sleeps.
That's a lot of blood.
It's Miranda Clark's.
She's in the hospital.
"Multiple cuts and bruises, concussion, possible skull fracture."
She have profile?
Her boyfriend does.
"Colin Blakely, The New Shadow."
"A year ago, he's bussing tables, now he gets 3 mil a picture."
So it fits the pattern of the other eight.
"Victim's high profile, young Hollywood, no forced entry, no prints."
Hmm.
Where was Mr. Blakely?
Clubbing.
Got home at dawn and found her.
They must have known he was out and got surprised by the girlfriend.
That's a big escalation.
Where's The Shadow now?
Kaiser.
He insisted on riding in the ambulance.
It happened before I got here.
What'd they get?
"3 grand in cash, and take a look."
Because I want to.
"Cinnamon, you have found a true friend for Jagjit to guide him through the highs and lows of life in America."
"Thank you, spices."
Their desires are now fulfilled.
"Whatever, man..."
I never got to cook for him.
Turns out he's fallen in love with someone else.
He told you that?
Yeah.
I can't hate him for it.
I've never seen him so happy.
"Please, spices, give me one night with Doug."
One night for my desires.
Then you have me forever.

Or is it my eye playing?
I have brought something for you.
Are you feeling better?
"Oh, yes."

She's been cooking all day for us and she's been keeping me company.
Today will you have some chai?
And you?
Sure.
I'll help her.

I've come to say goodbye.

How is this?

"A long, long time ago ..."
Very distant land ...
But so far ...
There is a little angel sleeping there ...
"I have done for yourself, John."
"Not for me, not for our daughter."
Have you done for yourself.
"Do not lie to yourself, even for a moment."
"- Hi, John."
"- Hey, Rache."
Ah ...
I made lasagna last night.
"Many, many more remained in my hand."
"If you open up, can I bring some of that."
What am I gonna do with you?
You need to warn His Holiness.
Casey!
Henry?
"Sweetie, what is it?"
"Angela, is there something you need to tell me?"
I'm sorry.
I've been very selfish lately.
"I haven't really let you in, have I?"
"Henry, if you won't talk to me, if you won't tell me what's troubling you, how am I supposed...?"
You need to confess.

I thought that was St. Jude.
"No, St. Jude is lost causes."
So how can you tell when something stops being lost and starts being a lost cause?
We're going to find Casey.
People don't just disappear.
Well...
"That's the problem, isn't it?"
She was disappearing... before she was ever lost.

What about Ed?
It's kind of urgent.

One of my whales disappeared.
I can help you.
I should probably talk to Danny.
I can do anything he can do.
Probably more.
- Really?
"- Oh, uh, really."
Can you find Mr. Harpel?
The guy you were supposed to meet earlier?
Mm-hmm.
You sure he didn't just stand you up?
Or maybe Paul Logan swooped in and yanked him from your clutches.
I knew this was too serious for you to understand.
"Hey, Danny."
It's Sam.
I need to talk to you right away.
Hey.

Where is your husband?
- You just missed him.
- Where'd he go?
"Over there, massage."
Something really got under his skin this morning.
Said he needed extra pressure.
"Huh, wonder what that could be."
"You know, just go help Dr. Kovac with the rapid infuser, all right?"
No problem.
What do you need?
"Central line, supraumbilical DPL, rapid infuser and a t-pod."
What's a t-pod?

What for?
This is my duty.
Not for the juice.
You did me a great favour yesterday.
You have protected my children like a member of the family.
"They're dear to me, too."
"Anything could have happened, if you were not there."
The worthless doctor just fled!
And I was thinking of getting him married to Janki.
I've changed my mind!
The doctor does not deserve Janki!
Have you asked Janki too?
Why ask her?
She has no sense either.
Maybe she loves him.
She was in love with that idiot of a film-man too!
But what happened?
- I don't know what he knew.
This is crazy.
"You're saying Dad hid one of his kids from us for years and then gave Holly the land, so his affair is thrown in our face because of some girl named Rebecca?"
I wish I could tell you what he was thinking.
- It's a shock for me too.
- I don't know why.
- He lied about having a mistress.
- That's not fair.
Why should I be so shocked that he lied to us too?
This whole family revolves around lying.

Please help me understand how you could discover your father has another child and not tell me?

- How?
By keeping me in the dark?
God.
You should've seen Justin's reaction.

"Besides your leg, are you feeling better?"
Why?

Your mother came every year.
Do you know where in Paris?

Then how should I remember?
"Victor, no."
Stop.
I'll bring him down myself.
Give that to me.
Look what you've done.

We can talk finally.
There's nothing to talk about.
You were right.
I was wrong.
I'm sorry.
"It isn't that simple, Michael."
"You thinkyou can let the job be whoyou are... all you are, and you can't."
It's dangerous to think thatyou can.
I know I can be...
passionate...
- but I'm good at what I do.
- I know.
- It's no secret that things between us have been--
- Little rocky.
It isn't easy for me either.
"Evelyn comes along, and she's attractive... sweet, needy."

"- No, it's not that simple, Miss."
- They are returned to sender.
"- But please, that's me."
"- Yes, by postal route, Miss."

My body can not afford to work any longer.
I want to cry!

"You know, it's amazing how much food you can eat if you eat the right food."
"I mean, like, I could eat a- a whole cow, as long as I didn't butter it."
- [ Doorbell Buzzes ] - [Emily] Come in.
Emily?
"Emily, wait till you see the present I picked out for-"
"Uh, Howard?"
"Uh, Bob- Bob, Howard's here."
"Hi, Bob."
"I, uh- I didn't realize you were here."
"Yeah, I-I kind of live here, Howard."
"Of course you do, and- and you should."
Uh
"- Well, I can come back later."
"I just, uh, stopped by to say hello."
- Yes.
Howard just... stopped by to say hello.
- That's right.
"Hello, Howard."
Hello.
"Howard, is there something you wanna discuss in private with Emily?"
"No, no, no, Bob."
"Uh, no."
Nothing at all.
"Uh, well, so you got a birthday coming up, huh?"
Wow.
Forty-one.
That's a biggie.
That's a really big biggie.
"I hope, uh, nobody in this room is, uh, planning anything for my birthday."
"Like what, Bob?"
"Oh, like people jumping out of closets, people jumping up from behind furniture... and, uh, expecting me to be surprised when I'm not surprised."
I sold it to Dick.
- Hundred grand.
It's his problem.
- I don't think so.
"Numberthree, which is probably the most important of all,"
I'm leaving tonight for good.
"Now, questions?"
[ Tires Screech ]
You fucked up the whole thing!
You screwed it all up!
- Stop it!
- You brain-damaged fool!
"God, and i picked out a car and everything!"
"Hey, now listen."
"If I didn't do this, we'd be in jail or at the river bottom..."
- with bricks taped to our wrists.
- [ Groans ]
- And you know it.
"- Oh, my God."
You're so stupid.
- Oh!
"- Oh, Crystal."
- We are under surveillance.
"- Oh, yeah?"
Yes.
Last night I stopped by a convenience store.
"A cop pulled in behind me, he got out, he followed me in... and then he pretended to get a cup of coffee!"
Did he pretend to get a doughnut?
"- Oh, you know--"
- You are nuts!
- You need to see a psychiatrist.
"- Oh, I'm nuts?"
Oh...
Out of time.
You found two answers...
And what you are looking for was transformer.
"This is the stuff you know, guys, isn't it?"
"Difficult to find in the hive, though."
Not particularly.
Not that kind of physics.
Not electronics.
"Well, not bad then, in that case."
"You got two points, well done."
"Team Araucarians, over to you."
Which topic would you like?
We have left...
We're good on...
"Music's not good for any of us, is it?"
No.
"Well, maybe me."
I work in technology.
"Technology, yeah."
Go for it.
Technology.
You've chosen technology.
You're looking for typefaces.
You've ten seconds to confer.
Typefaces?
"Helvetica, Comic Sans, Garamond, Arial, Times New Roman..."
Helvetica - we've had that.
Yeah.
Courier...
Time's up.
"Simon, at the far end, we're going to start with you."
Timetable updated.
-Mmm-hmm.
We'll have you out of there in less than two hours.
Has everything been taken care of at your end?
I can't confirm that.
is there a problem?
-No.
"-Get it done, immediately."
What?
Two hours.
"Ugh, this drilling is driving me nuts."
I wanna find David and Meredith.
(tapping THE GUN)
You sure no one else could be in here?
-What?
-Nothing.
I was just thinking they wanted something in the broadcast room.
Gotta get over there.
-Think they got what they came for?
-Let's find out.
It's pretty standard activity.
Two broadcasts yesterday.
Three last night.
There's gotta be something.
What?
What do you got?
Fifteen broadcasts this afternoon.
What?
katherine:
Just 20 minutes apart.
Whoever broke in here didn't do it to stop the broadcasts.
"Well, that's a good thing, right?"
Books?
Butterfly knife?
"Yeah, Dean."
- You okay?
- Sure.
Sammy...
"I mean, look, this is the third school we've been to this year, and it's only November."
I'm just sick of always being the new kid.
You'll be fine.
"If anyone gives you any trouble, you let me know."
Relax.
"Dad said this hunt will take him two weeks, tops."
"As soon as he gets back, we're out of here."
To another school.
Awesome.
"Ladies and gentlemen, please say hello to Sam Winchester."
"Hi, Sam."
"Class, say hello to our new student, Dean Winchester."
"Dean, is there anything you'd like to tell us about yourself?"
"Not really, sweetheart."
Take your seat.
Is there anything you'd like to tell us about yourself?
Not really.
Okay.
"Uh, grab a seat."
"Whoa, that's yours?"
Awesome!
"Dean, where are your books?"
"Don't need 'em, sugar."
Not gonna be here long enough anyway.
"All right, gang."
Essay assignment.
"Well, yeah."
"Okay, don't start doodling my name on your binder, okay?"
I just mean...
"I mean, I like you the way I like basset hounds."
Something pathetic about them.
You just wanna cheer them up.
Again with the sensitivity.

"- Yeah, he does."
JANINE:

Very nice.
- Javier?
- Yeah.
Javier if I asked you an honest question do you think you could give me an honest answer?
- I think so.
"- Good, good."
Because I think some of your guys might be smoking.
Javier?
- Is that the question?
- Yes.
- Seemed like a statement.
- The question part's implied.
I really didn't hear it in the inflection.
Javier have you guys been smoking or not?

"Well, unbusy yourself."

"Actually, I want to show you something."

"No, just us tools."
Fine.
"You two, over there."
-I'm gonna kill him.
"-No, you're not."
You're going to find out who's controlling him and then you're gonna help save him.
I suppose.
Always managed to find a bit of money from somewhere.
Do you know his name?
Aye.
Said his name was...
T Dan Smith?
No.
Richard.
Richard Grainger.
"But when you find him, tell him there's £2.10 to come back on that."
~ He won't be collecting it.
~ Off the cliff?
"Something like that, yeah."
"~ It's all part of the job, pet lamb."
"~ It isn't, actually."
~ I had to do it.
"~ Oh, please don't tell me this is character-building because you're living proof that it's not."
I could have you disciplined for that.
"~ Go on, then."
~ Lovers' tiff?
"Right, guv, there's three Richard Graingers in the Newcastle area."
"One is four years old, one's 78 and the other one is alive and well and works at The Ministry in Longbenton."
"So, the dead man's not from the area, then?"
Do I amuse you?
"What, is this that T Dan Smith blokey again?"
"He's called Richard Grainger now, is he?"
"Are there any chocolate biscuits, pet?"
What?
What's funny?
"Grainger Street, Grainger Town, Grainger Market."
~ Yeah?
~ Richard Grainger.
"Good night, beautiful."
Good night.
"Doctor, it's so nice of you to come."
My pleasure.
"And, Mrs. Comstock, what a heavenly gown."
How sweet.
Thank you.
"I believe you know Margo Stevens, Doctor and Mrs. Comstock."
- How do you do?
"- How do you do, Miss Stevens?"
"Margo is one of my husband's little golf partners, you know."
It's a shame you've never played yourself.
"Oh, you'd be surprised how much I know about the game."
Now be a dear and get Dr. and Mrs. Comstock a drink

- Thank you.
"You must come out some time, Mrs. Langley, and give me lessons."

"Danny, I was afraid you weren't going to come to my party."

"Kitty, don't lie."
You've got a tell.

I don't do a thing with my eyebrows.
- This came in a few minutes ago.
- Great.
Thank you for making an embarrassing situation even more embarrassing.
A dating service?
Kitty.
- You don't need a dating service.
"- No, I actually do."
I need a quick and expedient way to find...
- A husband?
"- No, Mother."
Not a husband.
"Sweetheart, there are other ways of fulfilling your physical needs."
- Electrical things...
"- Mother, no!"
Please!
Just...
- Somebody just kill me!
- OK.
If it's not a husband and it's not sex...
It's a beard.
Arm candy.
Somebody whose picture I can put on my desk.
Everybody in my office thinks the senator and I are dating.
"- Well, he is your type."
"- Oh, et tu, Mother?"
All right.
I'm sorry.
Just please continue.
Whoa!
"Hey, there's no one driving that thing!"
Ho!
Someone stop it!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Easy.
"Easy, boy."
You boys lose something?
- That was scary.
- Officer!
Good.
I've never seen such a thing.
Shouldn't we bring those boys in or something?
"Trust me, whatever punishment we give them, it's nothing compared to what's waiting for them at home."
"Those boys know if anything was to happen to that horse, if it got injured, the whole family would lose its ability to plow the field, make food for the winter."
So that's it?
"They're just gonna feel really, really guilty?"
It works.
Believe me.
It won't happen again.
"I guess growing up here, you know all this stuff."
You have no idea.
Where are we?
"Ohio, somewhere."
I miss Mommy.
I know.
Me too.
Come again.
Yes?
-I'd like to see Miss Cross.
Selena.
"Miss Cross, you have a father in the Navy, Lucas Augustus Cross?"
-My stepfather.
-Have you seen him lately?
Not for a year and a half.
-What's wrong?
"-He went on leave, didn't come back."
He's listed as a deserter.
"Miss Cross, are you sure you haven't seen him?"
I didn't even know for sure that he was in the Navy.
He hasn't called you or written you?
-No.
"-He disappeared from town... a year and a half ago, deserting his family."
"Well, it looks like he's running true to form."
If you do hear from him get in touch with 1st.
District Shore Patrol.
I will.
"Oh, Selena, don't get upset."
It's not your fault they can't find him.
What is it?
"What's wrong, Selena?"
"Mrs. MacKenzie, I've got to tell somebody."
I can't keep it to myself any longer.
-Every time I go out in that yard...
-What are you talking about?
Lucas didn't desert.
How do you know?
Because I killed him!
I killed him Christmas Eve in the shack!
I thought I had improvised well.
"- That's right, sire."
Stop.
We repeat.
"Carlos, please."
"Sire, it is best to avoid any comment."
Sorry.
His Majesty?
Very well.
"Yes, I'll be careful."
"I care for you, do not worry."
"I think so, yes."
"See you, His Majesty."
Mr. Lloyd?
The Queen told me to remember them
To film the speeches from start to finish and to grasp the smiles.
Do we do it again?
"Sire, the press conference will begin at 11pm at Miniatiürk."
"His speech, sire."
The Prime Minister has made some changes.
I remember that Turkey's handshakes are energetic.
Stop.
Perfect.
"Now we can go, sire."
"Mr. Lloyd, can follow us."
It's really tiny.

"Yes, it's a fiasco."
No.
"Well, that too."

It looks like an extension of Turkey instead of the opposite.

"Damn, this could be a big one."
Good!
Because this is only the beginning.
I'm going to love you and hold you and feed you and dress you

- Yeah...
Hang on to you and smother you with my love.
- Yeah...
- Forever and ever and ever

"- You know, it's gettin' a little stuffy in here."
"You know, I might go get some air."
"Oh, no, you don't."
"Oh, no..."
Not without your umbrella.
- Come on!
"- Here, let me get that."
Wait for me!
"Sugar, could you just do me one small, little teensy favor?"
Anything.
Could you leave me alone for like 30 seconds?
Anything but that.
"You know, I forgot my gumdrop buttons."
Yeah!
"Could you run over there and get 'em for me, please?"
"Sure, I can."
I'll be right back.
"♪ Gingy, Gingy ♪"
"Run, run, run, as fast as you can if you wanna remain a gingerbread man!"
Oh!
"- Oh, Gingy."
- Whaa...
I don't understand.
Go sit down.
"Bo, it's raining.!"
"Bo, it's raining."
"- It's raining, Bo!"
"- It's raining, Bo!"
You're on punishment when you get home.
You're on punishment when you get home.
And you're on punishment when you get home.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"It's gonna rain on your head, Bo."
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen... and welcome to St. Joseph's Annual Basketball Awards Dinner."
We had a... difficult year.
Most of you are aware of that.
"When I first went to St. Joe's,"
"I really did sleep, eat and drink basketball."
That was all I did.
But it became more of a job than a sport to play.
Things here have not changed since-
"You know, Coach Pingatore just had these dreams in his head."
hejust wanted me to go the same route he took Isiah.
The most steals.
he played as a freshman.
Not even Isiah was a four-year starter.
"You know, basketball was just like- he was possessed with it."
"You know, it was his life."
And he wanted it to be everybody else's life too.
All-conference in the SCC.
All-state in the Sun-Times.
A McDonald All-American nomination.
"M. V.P., 1990-1991 season, William Gates."

We did.
But only if you reach for the phone and call Canyon Valley...
Now.
How far away is that place?
Couple of hours.

"We were really, really moved by the online testimonials."
"Oh, yeah."
That was some powerful stuff.

Yeah.

Yeah.
Kickin' ass and takin' names!
That's how we do!
Uh...
[ Both chuckle ]
"Uh, to clarify, uh, what my brother's trying to say is, w-w-we both have a passion for-for fitness and helping people."
"Oh, us too."
Hm.
"In fact, that's how we first met."
I was Maritza's first client back in Peru.

"Oh, it's true!"

I endured it for 30 years.
"Now, enough."
--I snore?

"--Enough, Ira dear."
"--If I were you, I wouldn't touch this topic."

"--Pavel, what are you...?"
--Don't!
Just don't say that I am old and bald
--When did I ever say that?
--...that you are ashamed to be seen with me.
I am only human.
- What is it?
- It's people seen from above.
From the sky.
"See, these are people walking."
That's a person lying down.
And that's a person standing up next to a person lying down.
This is me... and you... and everyone we know.
Where is dad?

Come on.
Come on.

But it can't start until you call.

It's not a regular thing.
Last week I had to leave early one day-
Why did you have to leave early?
Is everything okay?
"Honey, go back to bed."
Was it the boys?
No.
Jesus!
"I have a personal life, you know."
"Oh, okay."
So I'll take them for longer next week.
"But you have'em this whole week... because Dave and I are going to the coast until Saturday, okay?"
"Good morning, doctor."
"Hello, Commissioner."
She died.
Just a few hours ago.
"Yes, yes, yes, yes..."
She was murdered?
Difficult to say.

"Janitor, a glass of water, please."
"Go, drink."
He probably absorbed a violent narcotic.
He'll be back.
Go away!
What do you want?
I am a physician.
Ease your mind.
Breathe quietly.
Deeply.
Tell us what happened to you.
My head hurts.
What happened to me?
"I do not know, I do not know."
"Ah, yes!"
"Yes, yes!"
"I was reading, last night and suddenly, some people came out of hiding and pounced on me."
"I wanted to free myself, but I was gagged, and they pierced my arm with something sharp."
I lost consciousness.
"I wanted to scream, move, but I was powerless."
I sank.
"But who are you, sir?"
The Commissioner eighteenth borough.
"When you were attacked, you were alone?"
It looks firm enough if we walk on the edge there.
"- Uh, sod that, you're carrying me."
- What?
"Shoes, 300 quid, come on."
Down you go.
Spoken like a true lady.
"Paul, be careful!"
"Luke, my shoes!"
"Quickly, before they fall in the mud!"
"- Oh, my goodness!"
- Ugh... elegance.
Elegance!
Hop on.
"Right, here we go."
So...
How've you been?
Good.
"Great, actually."
- You?
- Okay.
Course has definitely been an eye-opener
Really?
"Yeah, you meet all these different kinds of people."
"I mean, most of 'em work their arses off to get what we just take for granted."
Makes you realise you're not quite as special as you once thought.
"Bloody hell, Chris, that was bordering on self-deprecation."
Is it working?
"You haven't changed at all, have you?"
- What's the matter?
- Not funny...
Great.
Hi.
Give him a chance.
Just give him a chance.
- Give him a chance.
"- Man, all I know is he lives on 125th Street-"
- Above the barbershop.
"- What side of the street does he live on, huh?"
North or south?
"North or south, huh?"
"I don't know what you're talking about, man."
I don't know—
I'm asking you what side of the street he lives on!
"Hey, shithead, when was the last time you picked your feet, huh?"
"- Man, what's he talkin' about?"
- I've got a man in Poughkeepsie wants to talk to you.
You ever been to Poughkeepsie?
Huh?
- Have you ever been to Poughkeepsie?
"- Hey, man, give me a break."
- I don't know what you're talking about.
"- Come on, say it."
Let me hear you say it.
Have you ever been to Poughkeepsie?
"You've been to Poughkeepsie, haven't you?"
- I wanna hear it!
Come on!
- Yes.
"Yes, I-"
"- You've been there, right?"
- Yeah.
Yeah.
"You sat on the edge of the bed, didn't you?"
"You took off your shoes, put your finger in between your toes and picked your feet."
"- You, nothing!"
Who said anything about you?
"I let her work for me, paying her under the table.That doesn't concern you."
- Unreported employment?
"- Yes, that's my concern,"
I'll take care of it myself.
- Taxi!
- Police headquarters!
"Room 12, Mr John."
Room 12!
- Dr. Wulff!
- John!

"- Please, have a seat."
Thanks a lot.

"No, my wife has a laundry."
I am a haulier.
- What is it about?
- Do you know a certain Pauline Karka?
Is she dead?
Mentally unbalanced?
"Yes, certainly, she's insane."
"What did I tell you, Karl?"
Something is not quite right.
"She's not mentally sound - a quite common... pathological liar, I told him."
"Any word from her is a lie and whatever she has told you about me, that's all a rotten lie."
You cannot believe it.
About you?
She hasn't said a word about you.
- What?
- Do you know a Willy Koslanski?
"- Wow, is that a--"

All part of the plan.
I'm trying to save for the future.
"- Oh, Trav, that's great."
"- Well, yeah."
I got a family now.
"What did you think I was doing, freeloading?"
You know what?
I'm really impressed.
I'm going to pitch in to your savings and help you with your future.
Mom.
"Oh, my God!"
This is amazing!
[ Gasps ] This puts me over the top.
- The top of what?
- The thing I've been saving for!
What is this?
- My future!
- Huh?
Not so--
"Man, it just sat in the parking lot with a for-sale sign all month."
I'm so lucky no one grabbed it before me.
Super lucky.

"Not to worry, gentlemen."
Everything is under control.
Carry on.
A-ha!
"Take that, prohibition."
Hello!
Help!
Help me!
So you've been looking for the daughter of Milonkovic?
Why?
We think it would be in the car.
We began the search yesterday.
Daughter reported missing in Sweden.
She lives with her mother in Gothenburg.
Did you know about the person in the trunk?
-Yup.
-What Was the fucking game then?
Why did not you tell us?
Hello?
-I Can not say.
All right.
Let's forget whims and pride and work.
You then have the theory that she was in the trunk?
-Is It possible.
-And She was saved by someone that killed the other?
-Deixamos All options open.
"-Legal, Sikkeland."
Mutual-confidence now?
"-surely, On my part."
Where is she from?
Stay there!
-Fatalidades Or injury?
-Still Are there.
-Milonkovic Was there?
I do not know.
The explosive was in the back.
I suppose you have a good view of it and the league-Z?
"Look, Marsh."
The missing space helmet.
Judy.
"What's going on here, anyway?"
"Well, that, Marsh, is a bit of a story."
"At any rate, this is Dr. Alison and Captain Stedman of the American consulate."
Sergeant McEvoy.
How do you do?
They've been out looking for Sally.
"Well, I certainly hope Judy hasn't caused you any trouble."
"Oh, no."
No trouble at all.
She merely convinced us that she was Sally the astro-chimp.
With this helmet on I can understand how you could've made that mistake.
"Yes, now we're right back where we started from."
Unless we can get Judy to help us to find Sally.
(CHATTERING)
"Gentlemen, I think I have a pretty good idea where Sally is."
You have nothing to worry about.
She's safe and in good hands.
Chin up.
That's a girl.
Fine.
And again.
And once more.
That's fine.
"Well, Sally is in splendid shape."
"Thank you, Miss Tracy."
Let me see the results of the tests.
Sure.
(PAULA):
All I did was follow Dad's instructions.
You shouldn't be stuck in some stall balling.
And isn't there someplace else you'd rather be?
"- With my mom, but..."
- But what?
Where's she at?
At the hospital with him.
But it's... it's kind of upsetting there.
- You should be there.
"- l know, but..."
Angelica.
"Oh, my God."
We have to go with Sharon to the hospital.
I'll get Tino to drive us.
He loves hospitals.
"And Ricky will come, too."
The four of us.
Right?
Come on.
I have really been cutting Bio a lot.
"So, I should probably skip the hospital."
So I'll see you later.
Hey.
is this where you come to smoke?
"I'm always doing that,  I'm always asking questions I already know the answers to,"
"- So, are you crying or something?"
- l guess.
- How come?
"- Because I'm lonely,"
"Because I have no friends,"
"Because I'm a terrible, terrible person,"
Because of my friends father is in the hospital.
And he could die.
"Well, I'll get some kind of a job and start up the old road again."
"(male #2) 'What's the assessment, my good fellow?"
'
"(male #3) One forty, sir."
"Here you are, there's five dollars."
You keep the change.
"Thank you, sir."
And buy yourself a haircut with it.
"Ah, there you are, children."
"Father, where were you?"
I've been worried to death.
"Serving our noble cause, my dear."
"Here, just feast your eyes on that."
Fifteen thousand!
"Well, who's Magenta P. Schultz?"
"- Why, that..."
"- Father, how did you get it?"
When I told the Duchess the predicament we were in she insisted on helping us out.
- Insisted?
"- Yes, my dear."
Insisted.
"Ah, there's a woman for you."
Isn't it splendid?
"Come, come, my boy."
Reassemble the cast.
"Order the costumes, strike up the band."
The show will go on.
[laughing] [mumbling] Abracadabra.
Abra..
Abracadabra!
Abracadabra!
Here's your money.
"You know, haiukon."
Just...
- How was your journey?
- Great.
Thanks.
- The car pick you up okay?
- Yeah.
Wow.
This way.
Are they... seeing?
It's cool.
Very cool.
Wow.
Come on.
Feel like I'm gonna go meet Dumbledore.
Hope I get Gryffindor.
I'm gonna need your phone and anything else you might use to send and receive.
"- A little paranoid, don't you think?"
- Can't be too careful.
"Okay, there you go."
"Wow, you really are paranoid."
Whoa!
It's white.
Um...
"Okay, so I'm guessing this says, like, I agree to have my kidneys harvested?"
"Actually, it's a pretty standard NDA-disclaimer thing."
Okay.
It's important that you realize there is a small medical procedure involved.
"Sorry, for a game?"
"Nothing permanent and we don't harvest your kidneys,"
- I promise.
- Okay.
"alcohol, again?"
It's the perfume you gave me.
You're drinking perfume now?
From the train I saw a beautiful beach nearby.
I wanted to talk to you about that.
There's something I haven't told you.
An informer said they're gonna kidnap you to get access to the safe.
We have to escort you to yourhome.
Let me introduce my wife.
- A pleasure.
- Mattia.
Does he want money?
We'II include yourwife in the protection program.
- What's this guy want?
- High-five him.
- Y'aII ain't neverbeen South?
"- Who's ""y'aII""?"
"The next time bring a TV camera, there are loads of things you'II never see again, the first is the TV camera!"
What road's this?
"Different, we were afraid of an ambush."
Let's get out.
Hang on.
AII clear.
"Maria FIageIIo, at the ready, it's all okay, high-five."
follow us.
That would be yourugIy neighborMaria?
"Maria, my neighbor."
- YOU ASKED FOR IT -
"Now, Scapece."
They're coming!
Action!
"Don't worry, we'II soon be home."
There were 5.
And we've got 2 in camp.
"If you got all the villagers in, what would that do for you?"
That'd give us 300-500.
Better get on the Psy War about this.
NIM:
"When you leave, Dai Uy?"
Tomorrow.
Hopefully.
"Da Nang, Nha Trang, Saigon and home!"
My home is in Hanoi.
I go home too someday.
You see.
"First, kill all stinking Cong."
Then go home.
Will there be anything else?
"That's all, Nim."
NIM:
"Thank you, sir."
He sounds like he means it.
He keeps score on the wall of his hooch.
He personally greased 52 this year.
Says he'll double it if all the 'Yards will get out of his way and give him a clear field of fire.
I noticed a load of corrugated tin's miraculously appeared overnight.
Sergeant Petersen provided it.
A good man you got there.
Sergeant Petersen say where he got it?
He said the good fairy left it.
"I hope he said, ""The good fairy left it, sir!"""
"Captain, will you join us in the commo bunker?"
MacDANIEL:
"Good evening, colonel."
"âª Go home âª âª Broken bodies line the dance floor Piling on top of me âª âª I tried my luck, now what the fuck To do with the misery?"
âª âª Witness all the mess I will regret âª âª By this time next morning âª âª Broken bodies line the dance floor Piling on top of me âª
âª Broken bodies line the dance floor Piling on top of me âª
Oh.
Um...
What time is it?
I don't know. 10:17?
Are you all right?
Tired.
I didn't sleep.
I have an incredible headache.
You're dehydrated.
- Did I drink last night?
- You don't remember?
"Yeah, you drank."
At... at that bar?
"At the bar, here..."
Here?
Did something hap...
Did I do something?
I don't wanna talk about it.
What...
"Hi, boys!"
"Oh, I gotta run."
I gotta pick up the twins from my mother's and drop them off at daycare because I got the lunch shift today.
"Hope that things work out for you soon,"
- honeybunch.
- Oh.
"Alright, I'll see ya when I see ya."
Bye!
Bye.
What?
What's real is the cop we have tied up in the basement.
"When Marius calls, we can let him go."
The cop does not care about us.
- I swear to God...
- How do you know that?
It seems to me... we let him go.
"Best case... prison, my business destroyed, and Family Services takes Amanda."
- No.
- I won't let that happen.
[phone buzzes]
"[buzzing] [door closes, lock latches]"
- Hey.
"- Hey, Pete."
I'm just going out.
Where to?
"I was gonna go, uh, go see my friend..."
"- you know, the married one."
- Yeah.
"Yeah, I thought..."
I thought maybe... you were going out to slash another one of my tires.
Huh?
The liquor store across the street... they have a security camera.
I saw you.
Why?
- [gulp]
"- Fucking why, huh?"
Why?
"Don't you fucking say that it was about this trunk thing because I already apologized to you for that, okay?"
[breathing heavily]
Porta-Potty.
What?
"–Hey, hey!"
Everything all right?
Yeah.
Just a little spring cleaning.
Let's ride.
I thought this was about I.D'ing somebody.
"Actually, we're more interested in the kidnapping charge... that was filed against you in 1993."
That was a misunderstanding.
"–You were 35 at the time, right?"
–Correct.
–And your girlfriend was in high school?
–She was 18.
And you took her away on vacation for two weeks and never told her parents.
I know.
"In hindsight, it was just a bad judgment call."
But Amanda was an adult.
You're 17 years older than Marcy too.
"You like 'em young, Bob?"
Yeah.
They just...
feel right.
Did Kayla feel right?
I wouldn't know.
–I know how you feel.
–Excuse me?
What'd your partner do?
He's not backing me up on the shooting.
–If that guy costs me a promotion...
–He's not backing you up?
–After all I've covered for him.
–You covered for him?
–What did he do?
"Yeah, it's Ollie and Danny."
All right.
Never mind his eyes.
What about an airway?
Is he breathing?
"Do you copy, Ollie?"
What else have you got?
Is he conscious?
I don't know what to say.
"His eyes are open, but..."
"It's not the same thing, Ollie."
"Yeah, sorry about that, Kingdom."
We've got a multi-trauma.
Major head injuries.
"He's breathing, dazed, but conscious, probably shocky."
"Minimally responsive, compound fractures to the ribs, both tibia."
Fracture to both ankles.
Looks like his pelvis is fractured as well.
But it's hard to tell.
We've got multiple head injuries.
"BP is 78 over 44, it's going down."
"Respiration is, I'm going to say, 32."
- He's tachy.
- Heartbeat clocking 140.
Make that 150.
"All right, get a line in him, Danny."
Colour?
Saturation?
"His eyes are open and he's still looking around, but..."
There's Ollie the ophthalmologist with more eye data.
Got the line?
Line's in.
That's enough!
You're mistaken.
No mistake!
Witnesses?
I will be a witness.
He is Lun Taichen.
He's your father's old accountant.
"And he caused your father's death, by betraying him and watching him die in jail."
And then he drove your mother to insanity.
Shut up!
Who are you?
"I'm Old Honshu, Jeng's old servant."
"I know you stole that factory from them, and then all their land, and after that you got rid of every last one of their servants."
"But here you are, hunted by the police."
"You, you, ran away that night."
"I met you a few years ago, and I've been following you ever since then, just waiting for the chance to get my revenge."
I want to see you die before my very own eyes!
You're telling lies!
Honshu!
You go!
Right.
Come with me!
Uncle.
Where's Lun Sanye?
He escaped.
You okay?
Nevermind.
(gasping)
You okay?
Lun Sanye.
Lun Sanye?
"Tell me, what happened to Mei?"
"Okay, kids, don't try this at home."
(grunts)
What the hell?
Was that real?
"Wait, did somebody hit him?"
(phone rings)
"Yes, ma'am, we'll..."
we'll look into it.
Thanks.
"Hey, Marcus, my niece just called."
"She was watching some live video online, and she thinks she saw this guy get assaulted."
She's worried he might be dead.
"A guy who uses the name ""O.G. Pwnzr""?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, that's him."
She's not the only one.
911's ringing off the hook.
Apparently he was some sort of online celebrity.
"Whatever happened, it went viral."
Look at the number of viewers.
"30,000 people have seen this?"
Only no one knows the guy's real name or where he was in New York when this happened.
"If he's dead, there's a murder scene out there, and no way to find it."

(tires screeching)
(Cal shouts)
(Cal grunts)
(Cal grunts)
Federal agents!
Hands up!
Get out the car!
LASALLE:
"You okay, Dana?"
"Yeah, I think so."
Nice driving.
"You, too."
(grunts)
"Can't guarantee Dana won't spend some time behind bars, Mr. Connors."
"I mean, after all, she was complicit until she wasn't."
"Yeah, I know."
"But I spoke to the federal prosecutors, told them everything she did to help us bring down the crew."
"Plus, she's cooperating, so I'm hopeful."
"At least one way or the other, she's out from underneath it... finally... and safe."
That's all I wanted.
That's all Jared would've wanted.
Take care.
Yeah.
(clears throat)
Poor dude.
He's been through a lot.
"Gonna go through a lot more, too."
"Losing a child, nothing harder."
Sort of know how he feels.
We have a vision.
Ugh...
"Hey, come on, don't go!"
"Natasha, come on."
- Officer Scott.
- Doc.
So...
Lanagan Pike had a retropharyngeal hematoma.
"Blood pooled in his neck, most likely as a result of the fall."
OK.
So we need to keep him here for a few days.
"- So to be clear, I didn't strangle him."
- No.
"Well that's good, that's real good, 'cause I was worried I got carried away."
I was out of line.
- I apologize.
- Thanks.
Means a lot.
- Mr. Pike's intentions were...
- Intentions?
I don't give a rat's ass about Lanagan Pike's intentions.
He didn't break a window.
A police officer's dead.
I'm not saying he's not responsible
- for his actions...
"- Hey, hey next time an ER doc dies in the line of duty, give me a call."
"Pretty, pretty blanca, as ordered."
"That's great man, that's really great."
"Look man, I kinda ran into a little bit of trouble tonight."
Oh yeah?
That's too bad.
- I don't have any money.
"""Then the discharge..."

"Sharon, it's not fair!"
You've been in there ages!
Get out of there.
You leave Sharon alone.
"You all right in there, Sharon?"
Yeah.
Coming.
"Ah, no, no."
There's no hurry.
"No, I've been in already."
Ohh...
"Jesus, what were you drinking last night?"
I'm going back to bed.
"Ah, yeah, go on."
Good girl.
"I'll go on without you, what?"
- What's up with her?
- You shut your mouth.
Get in there and get your clothes on.
"Go down to get your breakfast... and get a bleedin' job for yourself, right?"
"Sharon, we're going to have to tell them."
"Stop it, will yous?"
I haven't stepped out
What about your apprentice?
If we're that skillful... we'd have rebelled long ago!
Get out!
"Okay, okay."
"Master, I'll take you to bed"
"Big Brother, Fan's death is questionable"
Do you think it's the old fart that did this?
That's not possible
The old fool does not have that ability!
It must be someone from the outside!
Who could it be?
The killer is in the temple
I am waiting for you
Very good!
Very good!
It's better than a stage performance!
Relax
You are too slow
Watch out!
Look clearly
"So it's you, you short-lived asshole!"
Don't be so mean!
Don't you want to know who killed Fan San?
Who is he?
Watch carefully!
I am the killer
Why did you kill him?
Because Jin Tianyun is my friend
Jin Tianyun!
How nasty!
I'm still a virgin!
(LAUGHS)
(CLEARS THROAT)
Blood of the Jabberwocky.
You have our everlasting gratitude.
And for your efforts on our behalf...
-Will this take me home?
-If that is what you choose.
You could stay.
What an idea.
"A crazy, mad, wonderful idea."
But I can't.
"There are questions I have to answer, things I have to do."
Be back again before you know it.
You won't remember me.
Of course I will.
How could I forget?
"Hatter, why is a raven like a writing desk?"
I haven't the slightest idea.
"Fairfarren, Alice."
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
She left me standing there without an answer.
"A case of nerves, no doubt."
-Alice.
-LORD ASCOT:
Good Lord.
-Are you all right?
-What happened to you?
I fell down a hole and hit my head.
"I'm sorry, Hamish."
I can't marry you.
You're not the right man for me.
And there's that trouble with your digestion.
He did not come.
Would he be it?

Very kind.
"Says Tót,it is not possible to silence this uproar?"

Stop it!
Yeah.
This is the good air.
This silence.
Believe it.
In constant noises and smelliness of 9 monthly a service working...
- What did I talk about?
- That in constant noise and smelliness...
That's right.
I cannot believe in the fact that I am at home
I know everything as your kind son wrote the things though.
"That Bábony... this the valley of Bartalapos kind Tót, we behind my back?"
Only Klein beer garden and the parsonage
Good.

Yeah.
Why?
Just wondering.

Sometimes I doubt myself.
I blame myself for not being lucky enough.
"I'm scared I'll spoil you with too much affection, but I'd still rather believe..."
Baby.
Love is an extravagant solo show.
I'm not afraid of ridicule.
"Eventually, you'll be moved."
Love is solo.

Your glance is overflowing with sparks.

"He and Mr. Grady are in Atlantic City, Judge arranging for the opening."
"Don't worry, my pet."
If Chowsky won't rehearse you today
I shall have him discharged.
[whistling]
Can't you see I'm busy?
The Judge wants to talk to you.
Hey!
Sam.
What's going on?
Divorce papers?
"Wait, Josh is asking for a divorce?"
"Not just a divorce, Erica."
He wants to wipe me out.
"Claire and Josh, separated at birth."
"He wants you to pay him $80,000?"
Yup.
Yup.
"Because, according to him, he ""put me through med school."""
That's ridiculous.
He didn't.
"You know, all of the signs were there, even from the beginning."
I--I just didn't even wanna see them.
Like what?
Like...
We just never talked--
"Never about anything important, never about how I felt."
"So, of course, after a while we become like strangers..."
It was like he had this made-up idea in his mind of who I was... and now here we are.
"You know what's really, really pathetic?"
"I just wanna run away from this whole thing,"
"So I go to Goblins like some desperate loser, looking for Kai."
Kai.
Really?
"And, uh, how was that?"
He wasn't there.
"He quit, actually."
What?
!
- This thing is kinda peppy.
You got a turbo on this thing?
You fellas spread out.
What's going on?
I have no idea.
I want you guys to check down here.
I've noticed a lot of foot traffic down these stairs tonight.
Foot traffic?
There's been no foot traffic.
Let's go.

"""When I looked once more for Gatsby,"

What the hell is this?
It's like a... a literacy thing.
A literacy thing?
"Yes, many of these poor boys have trouble reading."
"Nice work, Beaver."
I can read.
You're doing a great job.
The ZBZ sisters have been helping them learn a little.
"Secret philantropy, if you will."
-Think so?
-What happened to Tino Zapatti?
"-He's dead, isn't he?"
I'm talking about two years ago.
He got probation.
What sentence did you recommend?
Ten to 20.
I saw the rap sheet.
Tino was pushing drugs to kids.
"Not doing it himself, but having kids deal for him."
Weapon from a previous homicide?
Disappeared in the second report.
Who ordered it?
That I don't know.
Why didn't you ask?
Sudden urge to move to the country.
I forgot about it.
Now if you'll excuse me...
... you'dbettergetout ofhere .
My lumbago tells me that snow is coming.
You better hurry.
Buffalo gets socked in pretty fast.
Thank you for your time.
Watch your step. lt's slippery.
Thank you.
-How long?
-About an hour.
You don't want to suffocate in a tunnel.
They got to dig one out ahead.
"Meanwhile, enjoy the snow."
We can't eat snow.
-Try that diner over there.
You didn't go.
-You did the right thing.
"-No, I didn't!"
He had no business there without a ghost.
That should have been me plus backups.
But Eddie was such a hothead... .
I mean...
... thekindthatnevercoolsoff.
What do you want to tell me?
There was another probation report.
This one...
"... itsetTinoupforthemax, 1 0 to 20."
What happened to it?
I don't know.
Who wrote it?
That's all I got.
The probation officer... .
Name?
James Wakeley.
You won't find him on Leonard Street.
Where is he?
"Upstate, working parole."
I told you not to come up here.
You made a long trip for nothing.
Do you want to tell me the truth now or under oath?
"You looking to grow brass balls, miss?"
I'm doing well without them.
"Do you want a subpoena, or may we continue?"
What brought you here from Leonard Street?
New York State parole officer.
Better pay and pension.
-Nicer surroundings.
James:
I found the backpack.
"The dead kid's best friend, a nice young man named Liam."
He took it.
"Funny how he didn't mention that in his statement, huh?"
You stay away from my daughter.
Yeah.
Deal.
I'm heading to the best friend's house right now.
"Maybe you should, uh, just meet me there."
[Sighs]
[Phone beeps]
♪
Did I tell you how much I missed
Gracie's double-bacon BLT sandwiches?
"But even on my cholesterol meds, the doctors... they just never let me have one."
[Sighs]
"You remember Kevin Whitfield's best friend Liam, don't you, Duval?"
"Say hello, Liam."
Hello.
"Right, now tell the nice FBI agent what you didn't tell him last time."
[Panting] I...
I took Kevin's backpack.
He stole his best friend's backpack after he died.
Liam:
I just wanted his headphones.
He didn't need them anymore.
I swear.
Touching.
"Anyway, he kept the backpack and, uh, this was inside."
Can you guys let me down now?
How did you convince Gracie to let you into my stuff?
Yes.
Did you lie on his bed?
But I'm lying on your bed too.
"First you fool around with Fat Pig,"
"Then this over-aged virgin,"
And now you come for me.
You're worst than a bore.
You mean a whore?
Don't correct me.
I hate people who correct me.
- Yoyo!
- Shut up.
I don't want to see you again.
Get lost right away!
"Hello, handsome!"
- Don't touch me!
- Why not?
"Because I used to get 0 in my exams,"
So I'm allergic to anything that shape.
So long!
- Dumpling!
- Stop that!
You said you didn't like well-rounded people.
"You're different, you're unique."
How unique?
Because you're rounded in all the wrong places.
I have something to discuss with his Excellency.
"Your Excellency, this is the 'Beast'!"
Sir!
What's the matter?
Someone called Hiroshima wants to see you.
Hiroshima?
Take care.
Paul.
"Thank you, Lester."
"J, London's great, but I'm missing the New York skyline."
I hope you're well.
Paul.
Fax this to Galliano's buttmaker's boyfriend stylist... in Monaco.
You freak!
- What are those for?
- We're doing a strain... on say gal shalls and Roxanne gave it 6 pages.
Come in.
- I have to talk to you.
- You want another raise?
"I don't get paid, I'm an intern."
I think I might know who the Yuri is.
Let's continue with the pedicure later.
Privacy.
Let's talk.
Delicious!
Good morning!
"Good morning, boys!"
"Good morning, good morning, good morning."
"Wow, are we silent!"
- Did somebody die here?
- Yeah.
Every dog has his day...
"It's obvious that, the way you two are dressed, you're not here..."
- to talk to me about fashion.
- I'm afraid we're not.
"Lieutenant Pathmark, you're under arrest for the insider trading... code 327B, for industrial espionage."
I always knew you were the Yuri.
You have the right to remain silent...
Wait.
"Is that going in my file, too?"
"Now we're not going to recommend you leave the school,"
Because ms.
Rinsky would like to handle this directly.
"Dear, I blame myself."
"When you acted out,"
I should never have banned you.
"I mean, I'm an educator."
I believe in second chances.
"Therefore, you are now the opposite of banned."
You're gonna be the new room mommy.
"You'll be in charge of the phone tree,"
"And the school's pets are gonna be yours on vacations,"
And every Tuesday and Thursday...
Crossing guard.
"Oh, come on!"
And please...
Get help with your drinking.
Brick needs a mother.
Will do.
"Let's go, frankie."
"Oh, my god, aunt Edie."
I can't believe you just sprayed that guy right in the face.
That was nothing!
I've been teargassed in the face!
What?
!
Why?
"Oh, we were at a jazz club, and some of the white kids"
Wanted to dance with the black kids.
"Oh, my god."
"Come to think of it, that made me gag, too."
Okay.
Done.
[woman crying]
"Listen, crying in a women's dressing room?"
"Whoever it is, girl, big butts are in."
[crying continues]
That's Sophie's cry.
"I know, 'cause I hear it through the vent when she watches Nashville."
Sophie?
(Sophie) No.
Are you okay?
"(Sophie) It's not me, but I'm okay."
[sobbing continues]
"Sophie, why are you crying?"
When I heard what you said about the dresses...
It's just--
"It's almost, kind of like, you think I have bad taste or something."
No.
Caroline thinks you have great taste.
She does?
"Well, then she should say so."
Now.
"Well, Sophie, I think you have your own unique style."
"And I think... that I didn't hear the words ""great"" or ""taste."""
"Sophie, what do you even care what I think?"
Just say it!
"Sophie, I think you have great taste."
You do?
[Sophie laughs]
"Then, what are we doing sitting here?"
Let's go and get those dresses back!
"I think treating her like a person, the kid's in love."
"You know, maybe she's in love with the possibility of something solid."
"I'm what she aspires to, a role model or something."
"Because if you're crossing the line, then it's you who's messing up."
"Yeah. I hear you, lieutenant."
LARSON:
"Hey, I gotta talk to you."
LlCALSl:
Okay.
"-What's going on, Janice?"
-Nothing.
Then how come the duty roster's paired me with Sackler?
Because I asked for a new partner.
-lf it's because I blew that undercover-- LlCALSl:
No.
LARSON:
Then what?
I don't think you are a safe or reliable partner.
-l can't believe I'm hearing this.
-You want it straight?
-You have a substance abuse problem.
-A what?
Substance abuse?
is that what your friend Kelly's saying?
"Okay, Roy, why don't we just drop this, okay?"
This is not about Kelly.
"And the thing I said, maybe I'm wrong."
All I know is that I'd feel...
... morecomfortablepartnering with somebody else.
-l can't argue with that.
-No hard feelings?
No.
- See you next trip.
"- All supplies aboard, sir."
- Thank you.
Parade the recruits.

"Look lively, will you?"
"Come on, come on."
Fall in at the end of the lines.

Get in that line.
Recruits ready for inspection.
"One wants to be put ashore, sir."

He's a fraud.

- Are you related to Admiral Wagstaffe?
- He's a distant cousin.
He would speak for you?
How well do you know him?

"You claim that, do you?"
Do you also claim to be a madman?

My cousin?
Can you please tell me what's really going on?
"Nothing, Joanie."
It was fate.
"If Sophia hadn't sent me packing,"
I never would've met this adorable little equine shrinky-dink.
Those are our vows she's chewing.
Hmm?
"Uh, here."
There.

"Come on, Lemonade."
I'll take you back to the barn.
The trainer was nice enough to take her back.
"Evidently, this happens all the time."
"What she hadn't told me is the minute you take them off the ranch, they lose 40% of their value."
(yips)
Who are you?
This is Tank.
Tank's a Yorkie.
"Oh, my goodness."
"Hello, Tank."
I'm John.
"I was thinking about what you said, honey, and-and maybe this isn't about a horse; maybe this is about you struggling with Sophia getting older."
And so I got you a pet that's gonna stay little forever.
"Oh, thanks, Joanie."
"You're so welcome, sweetheart."
I love you.

- What?

I couldn't save Deepa either.
If you can't forget her.
If you are so attached to her.
Why am I even here?
Why is this wedding happening?
"Sadhana, please."
I did ask you.
"If you weren't able to forget her, I was ready to step away."
"You kept nodding your head and expressing interests in me, and now you are after her."
"You took the wedding chain as well, didn't you?"
"Had you saved her, Would you tied it around her neck and married her?"
"Mom, ask her to keep quiet."
Why should I stay quiet?
"Sadhana, be calm."
It's not necessary anymore.
I will leave.
I'm not ready to get mislead by him any further.

I don't want this wedding.

Sadhana.
Sadhana.
Dave's right.
"I mean, you know, why go through with it just to get a divorce 2 weeks later?"
- Exactly.
- I think actually she just kinda got really overwhelmed.
"Uh, she saw Brian and then freaked out and left."
- Have you talked to her?
- No one has.
"So she hasn't spoken to them, and they haven't spoken to each other."
We ought to just invite Marjorie and have a really awkward barbecue.
That'd be awesome.

He's buying a Geiger counter.
God damn.
"Look, I need you to stall him for an hour, all right?"

I don't know.
"Look, you want to succeed in the life?"
Figure it out.
Work the problem.

Nope.

"Get out of here, right..."
But I don't think you heard me.
"Look, I may not be Tucker's dad, but I'm not gonna let anything happen to him or his mom."
"So, if I were you,"
I would just... stay away.
- Or what?
"- Well, trust me."
You don't want to find out.
"You see, that's my boy and my woman."

I know you're here.
I'm gonna kill you.
- I don't think so.

"- Put down the weapon, Figgis."
There you go.
"Oh, yes."
I've been waiting for this moment a long time.
You ruined my life.
I had to live in Florida for six months!
- It's the worst.
Have you tried the pizza down here?
"- Yeah, it's the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted."
It somehow burned my mouth and is cold at the same time.
But none of that changes the fact that you're about to go to prison for the rest of your life.
"- Drop it, Sherbert!"
- What?
No!

Don't change the subject.
We're talking about shirts.
We've got an empty shop here.
"Come on, you're supposed to be outside getting customers in."
Smarten yourself up.

"The first time I was introduced to all of them at once, it was crazy."
Paulie and his brothers had lots of sons and nephews.
Almost all of them were named Peter or Paul.
It was unbelievable.
"Meet Paulie Jr., my nephew."
And this is Petey.
There must have been two dozen Peters and Pauls at the wedding...
This is Marie.
"...plus, they were all married to girls named Marie."
She looks Italian.
And they named all their daughters Marie.
And this is Pete.
"No, I mean Paulie."
I get confused myself.
"By the time I had met everybody, I thought I was drunk."
"Paulie, you shouldn't have."
Welcome to the family.

"Karen, here's something to help you get started, huh?"

The bag.
-What bag?
"The bag with the envelopes in it, all the money."
Don't worry about that.
Nobody's going to steal that here.
He didn't call?
-He's with his friends.
-What kind of person doesn't call?
He's a grown-up.
He doesn't have to call every five minutes.
If he was such a grown-up why doesn't he get you two an apartment.
Did you... notice any black smoke?
"What are you, crazy?"
So?
I think she's telling the truth.
"I mean, the way she talked about being there mentally but not physically --"
Kind of sounds like demonic possession to me.
Kind of?
She didn't see any black smoke or smell sulphur.
Maybe it's not a demon.
"I mean, kids can be vicious."
"Well, I mean, we're already here."
Might as well check out the school.
Right.
The school.
What?
"Truman High, home of the bombers."
What's your point?
I don't know.
"I mean, we went there, like... for a month a million years ago."
- Why are you so jazzed to go back?
- I'm not.
I just think it's worth looking into.
"All right, well, what's our cover?"

The Book.
Give me the Book.
"You want the treasure, give me the Book."
These aren't book pages.
But what else could they be?
They're punch cards.
It must be an ancient...
"It's a computer, and these cards program it."
"Kelly, slide these in where the symbols match."
"Professor, let me see the Torch."
Here.
But how does it run?
A computer needs electricity.
Maybe not.
The people of Atlantis tapped into the volcano for power.
They used geothermal technology.
You mean this thing runs on heat?
No.
Steam.
Look!
Treasure chests.
Stay back.
It's nothing but paper.
Would you mind autographing this for me?
Where did you get my picture?
From a little frame out by the door.
"Oh, hold on, that's mine."
"Oh, well, I'd prefer whenever you're smiling."
"- Do you, ever?"
"- Yes, when I'm amused."
"You know, I think I could use you in my fall production."
I don't play animal-act.
"No, really."
I'm putting on a Broadway show next season.
"You're putting on your show right now, and it's a flop."
Wait a minute.
I'll meet you out front.
Hey.
[laughing]
I hope you make it in time for your fall production.
How did I get in?
"Oh, man!"
"Goodbye, partner."
[screaming] Help!

"- Yes, sir."
- Travelled here and abroad?
"- Yes, sir."
- How many languages you speak?
"- Five, sir."
"Well, I think we can use you."
"Salary, 22.50 a week."
I work right across the street.
Yes.
We work right across the street from it.
Did you ever own a firearm?
I already told you no.
"No, I've never owned a firearm."
Why are you hassling me?
Just call County.
- Where'd you say you were?
"- You know, I told you where I was."
- What kind of a doctor are you?
- I'm a med
- I'm a med student.
I'm a med student.
What difference does that make?
- What kind of doctor are you?
- I told you what I am.
"Look, we brought you in because you match the ID."
Because I match the ID.
What?
"Young, black and handsome?"
That's
"- No, that's ridiculous."
I'll send them over immediately.

"- Yeah, bottom shelf."
Messenger off personnel face sheets for Pratt and Gallant to Area Seven Headquarters.

Why?
- Just do it.
"Susan, Sean Simmons is being discharged to home hospice care."
It's not like you've ever treated women in such a way that would invite some sort of karmic retribution.
You banged my sister!
"My sweet, little, innocent..."
Pierced.
Really?
Where?
Don't answer that!
Now I know why I felt everything you did to her last night.
"It wasn't a bro-nnection, it was a sis-nnection!"
"Oh, my God."
Ted... did you...
Big-time.
Nice!
High five!
Wait!
No!
No!
Retraction five!
"Hey, hey, you're the one who begged for a proxy bang."
"And while we're on the subject of family,"
I'm pretty sure you banged my mom-- mom beats sister.
I never banged your mom.
You just did the winking thing again!
"No, I didn't."
Fine.
"Hey, Barney, let me ask you something."
"Were you, uh, feeling a little sore this morning?"
Especially...
Friendship over!
"Oh, yeah."

He lectures alcoholics on television.

--An totally normal jerk!
Pavel!
--Oh Lord!
--Bye
Poor man!
"Heart problems, Pavel Ivanovich?"
--Do you have a pen?
--Left it at work
"And garage keys, too."
Can we stop over and get those keys?
--My new bumper is there...
Bobylev...
"If we open up your brain, what will we find there?"
--Brains.
--A bumper!
"--One ball-point pen, please --Can you read, sir?"
It says we're on break from 14:00 to 15:00
It's 15:00 now
Can you hear the music?

But we live as if the entire universe separates us!
I am speaking to you from Venus and you cannot hear me on Mars
"And I shout over to you, lady, darling, sweetheart... please sell me that ball-point pen for 37 cents!"
I really need it.
My life depends on it.
And what?
How can one live this way?
What for?
Hello..
- Are you Ria?
We admitted Karthi in the hospital.
- What happened?
He got 3 bullets in the shootout with gangsters.
Situation is too critical.
He actually wanted to retire from Police job but has continued for you.
"When he said to join as a stuntman, I refused."
I committed a big mistake.
It is a lie that there is another one like me.
I am not a Police as you are thinking.
I am a stuntman.
Bruce Lee!
I tried many times to tell this to you but could not say it.
It was not to cheat you.
Due to lack of courage..
Reason was the fear that you would leave afar.
I'm sorry!
I am loving you not your profession.
Love you

"Expect we'd better bivouac at Elephant Rock, as usual."
"Yes, Markham sahib."
"I don't like it, Mitchell."
I don't like it.
Silence is unhealthy.
No word from Markham in 48 hours.
"Blast it, an officer and his patrol don't vanish into thin air."
"- Telegraph just got through, sir."
- Good.
What have you got?
Wires apparently down for the last two days.
I thought it was something like that.
"Emergency signal, sir."
Why doesn't he go on?
"Wire's gone dead, sir."
I don't like this.
Can't have the wires down.
Things start too quickly up there.
Higginbotham.
Find Sgts.
"MacChesney, Cutter, and Ballantine, and bring them here."
"That's a bit difficult, as they're all on leave."
"On some mysterious mission, they said."
It'll be a mystery if they come back right side up.
Bring them here at once.
- What do you want?
- Where's Sgt. Ballantine?
- Here.
- Where's Sgt. Cutter?
He's busy.
Buying a map for a buried treasure.
You ought to have your head examined.
Let's get back to the 'Beast'!
How will I benefit if I succeed?
You'll become a nameless hero.
I said how will I benefit?
The League of Nations will thank you!
What benefit is that to me?
The whole world will love you!
That means I don't benefit at all!
More than that.
There's half a million!
- Japanese Yen?
- American dollar!
American dollar?
Where do I find the American?
Cafe Casablanca.
Take him to Room 44 here.
What does he look like?
Wearing a white suit and a pink rose.
"When you see him, just say:"
You want woman?
Worth's half a million.
"And he'll reply, 'Get some sort of toys'!"
Good. I'll go first!
"- Hold on, I'll go first!"
- Why?
So that I don't have to pay.
Tips?
"Book says don't give anything today, especially tips."
What a miser!
White suit and pink rose?
What a coincidence!
"Mister, you want woman?"
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm a cop.
Jeffrey's a professional killer.
He murdered somebody.
I've been after him for months.
- I don't believe you!
-Jenny!
"- Listen to me,Jenny!"
- No!
"-Jenny, it's true."
- Chang!
"Jenny, calm down."
"Listen, please!"
Sit down.
Six months ago...
Jeffrey shot your face up by accident.
Now his employer wants him dead.
I don't believe it!
"I'd like to help, but I can't, in my position."
I hope you'll cooperate with us.
"Jenny, we're using you as bait."
It can bringJeffrey in this time.
I'll save his life foryou.
"Otherwise, the guy who hired him will kill him."
Name your price.
I want him dead.
He was recognized doing thejob.
"I want him wasted, the sooner the better."
"Deposit $1 00,000 into my account now... and $200,000 more upon completion."
"No money, no action, Mr. Weng."
Not even if I see his finger on the trigger ready to blow your head off.
- Put the hundred grand in his account.
This was imported. lt came in two pieces.
Do you believe what they can do?
"-Nice, huh?"
-Come here.
Did you and Jimmy talk?
"Yeah, I talked to him..."
He's looking into everything.
"This'll make the Air France hold up look like Goddamned peanuts, man."
Come on.
-It's ok...
"He's gonna do it, right?"
-l told you.
He's looking into it.
We'll see what happens.
No promises.
Do you understand?
There's millions in there.
And I've been bleeding for this. I've been cultivating this son of a bitch for two years.
He owes me 20 grand.
Once in a lifetime.
I could retire.
No more nut every week.
No more bullshit.
My dream comes true.
Morrie Let's get a drink.
And these are the guys Jimmy put together for what turned out to be the biggest heist in American history.
The Lufthansa heist.
Tommy and Carbone were gonna grab the outside guard and make him get us in the front door.
Frenchy and Joe Buddha had to round up the workers.
Johnny Roastbeef had to keep them all tied up and away from the alarms.
Even Stacks Edwards got in on it.
He used hang around the Lounge and play guitar.
"If not, you'll have to bottle it into him, but do be careful."
You can choke a beast that way.
"Anyhow, nurse is on the job."
Yes.
I have the distinct impression that I'm under supervision.
Hmm?
Is she always like this?
Aye.
Funny how they are in their ways.
Judy here thinks she's responsible for all the stock on the farm.
"Well, sheepdog..."
"Keen instinct, I suppose."
"Oh, it's more than that."
She likes to take charge.
"Newborn calves, new kittens all get licking and nursing treatment from old Judy."
It'll be all to the good for this little chap.
It might give him a new interest in life.
"You're a rummer, all right, are you, lass?"
"Hello, James."
"- Hello, siegfried."
Savaged?
"Hammer blow, actually."
I trust you weren't using it on a patient at the time.
Sorry.
Can I do the honors?
That's okay.
- Come on.
"Thank you, James."
Pleasure.
James...
- Mm-hmm?
May I ask you a very Frank question?
Can't make a perfect world.
"No matter what, shit happens."
It felt really nice to be desired today.
It meant a lot.
Thank you.
"Honey, i always desire you."
"Usually, it just annoys you."
No.
You want to have sex all the time.
"Today, you desired me."
okay.
Okay.
We still don't know the truth about jane.
I'm just saying.
Madeline had anger issues.
Itty bitty ball of rage.
Wanna see her rage issues?
"Call her ""itty bitty."""
"Renata had the whole kind of ""sexy praying mantis,"
"Bite your head off after sex"" thing going."
"Oh, yeah, that bonnie's just the sweetest thing."
"Yeah, right."
"Celeste-- she is an accomplished attorney,"
And some people in this town resent that.
"Rich, beautiful, madly in love."
Something had to be wrong.
Hey.
Hey.
What are you thinking?
I'm trying to decide whether i'm happy or sad.
People usually know.
I'm sad because--
"so Yawang, you have to be happy!"
Yawang!
Yawang.
You will never know that my basic wish was
just to admire the paradise together with you.
I think we will see each other in the next life.
"At that time,"
I'll be waiting for you!
"At that time, if you don't come,"
I will stay young!
"At that time, you would not loose me again."

Want a jelly bean?
"Oh, some of these are wet."
That's weird.
They should all be wet.
I'm going to go boil my hand.
MASON:
There's nothing to be scared of.
Just relax and go with what feels right.
CLARK:
This is all too much at once.
You can't deny your feelings.
[whispers]:
It's not that easy.
Ours is a forbidden love.
"Yes, of course I do."
Humphrey.
Where's your mind?
"You know, I know it sounds crazy, but I actually kind of miss high school."
I miss Blair Waldorf and her daily ego demolitions Nelly Yuki stealing my lunch.
"Even Chuck Bass, who'd get so close to talk."
"Wow, you miss Chuck Bass."
"Well, not as much as you probably miss Chuck Bass."
"But, yeah, I think it's safe to say that the nostalgia has officially begun."
"Apparently, the Upper East Side feels the same about you."
"What's up, Dan?"
Vanessa.
Shouldn't you be giving the deputy mayor her coffee?
"Well, I think she'd rather I gave her something else."
"- Yeah, she made a pass at me."
- God.
Is she hot?
"- Actually, yeah, she is."
- You're both disgusting.
"You know, I don't wanna be the guy Gossip Girl made me out to be."
"So, what are you gonna do?"
Go backpacking.
- If you'll have me.
"- Well, it's too late."
- I'm-
- I'm taking someone else.
"- Oh, really?"
Who?
- That's me.
- Him.
"Yeah, we're gonna have a great time, Melissa and I."
"Oh, really?"
Ye...yes.
"If this is good to get this to cinemas, we'll have a few of them standing."
Well done.
Yeah.
Yeah!
Do I have the job?
Well why not?
"Twins after all, double the slob."
Temporary secondment to bake the productions.
No screen credit.
Ministry wages.
I need more.
I could throw in less.
I need more than Ministry wages.
I'll talk to Baker.
Leslie Backs birthday mine.
Still staggering around the studios giving his unhinged love to young ones back...
Oh!
"No, no, no Ceres."
Too much glass.

Spitfires.
Won't you help a bird?
"Ambrose Hilliard, a man with the glimpse."
Oh!
I know him a celebrity.
Would you do him for me?
Would you?
Inspector Chamforth?
Someone has made a mistake.
It's a simple mistake.
And it's easy to him.
No.
"You were right, let's kill him."
"Oh, no."
"""Kanima."""
I was under the impression they were no longer dating.
"Me too, but it looks like they are."
And more.
A lot more.
How do you know it's not some other impressionable young girl with severely low standards?
Because I know Scott.
And Allison is the only one that he's ever talked about like that.
I just wanna make sure they continue to be safe.
I couldn't agree more.
Hey.
What if it's Matt?
"I mean, this whole thing comes back to the video, right?"
Danny said that Matt was the one who found the two hours of footage missing.
Exactly!
He's trying to throw suspicion off himself.
"So he makes Jackson kill Isaac's dad, one of Argent's hunters, and the mechanic working on your jeep?"
-Yes!
-Why?
Because...
He's evil.
-You just don't like him.
-The guy bugs me.
I don't know what it is.
Just look at his face.
Any other theories?
You okay?
-I have to go to the bathroom.

That's a strange marriage.
He was only gonna find clients.
I'll tell you something.
"If I'd met him earlier, I'd never be in this mess."
If only Tino hadn't whacked Eddie.
Know why he was there that morning?
Santos wasn't there to take Tino down.
He was there to get information on the judge.
How do you know?
I was there that morning.
What information on the judge?
"That you get with $1 0,000 and a plane ticket."
Come up with it by tomorrow.
This meeting is adjourned.
Let us bring you in.
We'll put you in the Witness Protection Program.
"No, thanks. I got my own Witness Protection Program."

Where have you been?
-Had a busy night.
-l'm sure you did.
"By the way Miss, did you know that Kayama-san is driving a bus in Ito in Izu?"
Kayama-sensei's doing that?
"Kayama-san was your teacher, right?"
He went from a famous dancer to a bus driver pretty quickly!
We're eating.
Would you mind waiting downstairs?
Sorry.
I'll talk to you later.
Do you think what he said about Kayama-sensei is true?
"Considering the source, I don't know how much stock you should put in the story."
Takao.
What is it?
I haven't seen you in quite a while.
May I?
There's a seat over there.
That's
- I see.
Your mother is on the second floor.
Did you know that?
Wouldn't it be better to stay away from people like Numata?
He's someone whom I've known since I was a student.
"He's helped me out, you know."
Mother!
Don't hang around with Numata.
He's so irritating!
He's trying to stir things up in the family.
That's not something you should say out loud.
He has the hots for you.
Takao!
Father is coming home tomorrow.
He sent me a letter.
Takao.
The situation's totally unacceptable.
"Well, gentlemen,"
I guess that just about wraps it up.
Where is the Ark?
I thought we'd settled that.
The Ark is somewhere very safe.
From whom?
The Ark is a source of unspeakable power and it has to be researched.
"And it will be, I assure you, Dr. Brody,"
Dr. Jones.
We have top men working on it right now.
Who?
Top men.
"Hey, what happened?"
You don't look very happy.
Fools.
Bureaucratic fools.
What'd they say?
They don't know what they've got there.
"Well, I know what I've got here."
Come on.
I'll buy you a drink.
You know... a drink?

The poison is still fresh...three days.

This is it.
This is where Forrestal cashed in.

A competitor.
I found about the courier by hacking into
My father's computer a couple of days ago.
When?
Two days ago.
Then I called you.
When did you hack into his computer?
Sydney.
Two days ago.
Everything I'm telling you
"Is the truth, I swear."
So your father's still alive?
Yes.
And I would do anything
To bring him down.
"(courier:)this is not my fault, da veiga."
You saw me.
I followed instructions.
Somebody compromised our security.
"What, you going to tell the council?"
Obviously one of our dikes needs plugging.
Did you get a good look at
The person with fox and bailey?
I could pick him out a line-up.
Do you want me to go track them down?

No.
Thank you.
You know what this means?
"Yeah, we're in it up to our eyeballs."
Karen was right.

"- Maggie, what the fuck?"
!
- Why don't you give Carlos money?
- ¿Tú estás loca?
- As a loan to get back the bodega.
- Maggie!
- This could be a way out of here.
"You heard what he said, he needs that money."
You were gonna give me that money to open my own space.
"Shut the fuck up, you're family."
Carlos isn't family?
He'll pay you back.
"It's my business, I can take care of it, okay?"
People buggin' out around me today.
"Later, bro'."
"You got a big fucking mouth, and I ain't got no money."
Where did you put them?
Where'd you put them?
"I'm tired of your fucking bullshit game, viejo."
Where are my fucking drawings?
Carlos...
I should be the one that would be making the questions here.
How many gallons of milk did you deliver today?
How many cases of aguacate?
Yuca?
- Plátanos?
Café?
- I don't fucking know.
That's what you should be worrying about.

"The police identified the body of reporter Takeshi Kurosaki, age 35."

Did you hit these?
I think so.
You broke the dolphin.
Who's that?
From the Administration.
And who are you?
Haven't seen you around.
This is Rin.
Department?
I'm not a student.
So you can't join the team.
"Ryuji, Iet her apply."
"If you can hit that strong, you should apply."
Alright!
I'm soaked!
Right down to the underwear.
This way.
It's quite easy to apply.
What's that?
A special training facility.
It's a restricted area.
Are there glasses?
- But of course.
Everything's supplied.
"- Oh, dear."
- What?
"Well, I was just thinking of Mother."
"This afternoon, she tried to tell me what happens on a wedding night."
She's a bit late.
What did you say?
"I said she was a bit late, didn't I?"
Henry?
Mr Faber?
What are you doing?
It's all right.
It's... just for the station.
Classified work regarding the trains.
I shouldn't really be telling you.
"- Please, listen to me."
- No.
Trust me.
- You're a spy.
- Stop struggling.
"Listen to me, please."

You may address me directly.
Yes.
Don't you think you should be at home?
With your husband?
"Darling, I wanna go home with you."
But I can't until I know the results of those tests.
"Alexis, I don't understand it."
"I mean, what are you doing?"
"Are you still choosing between me and Galen, with me in second position?"
"No, Dex."
I love you.
"Oh, God, we went through hell to rescue Galen."
Can't you understand?
Can't you try and support me like a husband should?
I find it hard supporting my wife's apparent love for another man.
Wrong tense.
I loved him once.
But I'm frightened for him now.
"Mrs. Dexter, King Galen is asking for you."
Thank you.
"And I'm frightened for us, Alexis."
I'll see you later.
"Hello, Galen."
- Alexis.
- Mm.
I was so afraid.
But not for my life.
I thought I might not ever see you again.
No.
"Here I am, larger than life."
And you're safe now.
"Your life is safe here, Galen."

Merchandising.
And ancillary rights in perpetuity.
"Anyway, what a race, champ!"
"I didn't see it, but I heard you were great."
"Thanks, Harv."
"Listen, they're giving you 20 tickets for the tiebreaker thing in Cali."
I'll pass 'em on to your friends.
Shoot me the names.
"- You let Harv rock it for you, baby."
- Right.
Friends.
"Yes, there's..."
"OK, I get it, Mr. Popular."
So many you can't even narrow it down.
"Hey, when you get to town, you better make time for your best friend!"
Break bread with your mishpocheh here!
That'd be great!
We should totally...
"OK, I gotta jump, kid."
Let me know how it goes.
I'm out.
What?
A minivan?
"Come on, you're in the slow lane."
This is Lightning McQueen you're hauling here.
Cover page?
Manoj.
Why is he sobbing like this?
How many shocks in the truth can he bear to hear in a day?
He will be normal in a while.
You left him to sob alone?
- What do you want me to do?
He is crying by himself.
You should be the one to console him.
Go.
- Not again!
"So, she has been selectively cheating blind men."
They have to be blind...
They must believe her stories.
Must be ready to give the money she asks.
She targets those people.
in the name of love...
And made a clean sweep.
"If my instincts are right, even now... she should be cheating someone..."
Call Priya.
Priya...
Where are you?
"You, are one sneaky lady."
"A small, loveable vampire."
"You are a feisty flood, in a body that is opaque like glass."
"You, are one sneaky lady."
"A small, loveable vampire"
"You are a brilliant player, who plays very casually."
"Oh, you..."
"Smart, sneaky girl!"
"Oh, you..."
"Smart, sneaky girl!"
Do you want to see a miracle?
It is your law.
The puppet who made you jump in the air.
You do not jump and do not jump no more!
None!
None!
You can not understand.
I come!
I promise.
- Do you want systems too?
- No!
I have no shame.
It's not my fault.
The fault is mine.
Idiot.
Where have you hunted?
"Fear not, the police will be here in 3 minutes."
"First, let me speak."
"I, the massacrer of the evening, I was not there."
I don't know this gentlemen at all
"If you do this for me, there has never was a girl in the courtyard ..."
Silence!
What the hell on earth are you looking for?
I don't know.
We are not going to play a tambourine together.
She certainly has a motto princely.
"Wherever I walk, the rogue disappears."
"""The countess scal ..."" ie ""the barefoot princess,"" so to speak ..."
Mankiewicz ...
You have seen death the mother at the hands of Venini.
The 4 brothers Venini ...
The 4 fingers of Mickey ...
- No.
- I feel all right.
- That's good.
I'm glad.
I'm getting old.
- Are you getting old?
- I don't remember everything.
"But you know what you always said, Dad?"
- What?
- You said that when a person reaches 80... they have the right to forget whatever they want.
- Is that right?
- That's what you said.
"So I tell everybody, if they forget something..."
"I said my father says, ""When you're 80, you can forget - you have the privilege to forget whatever you want."""
- How do you like that?
- [Chuckles]
I made that as a real... appointment... and maybe it's really true.
- I've got something for you.
"- No, no, no."
- I've got something for you.
- What do you got?
What have you been asking for for the last two weeks?
- I don't know.
What did I ask for?
- Take a look.
Come on.
"Oh, for heaven's sake."
Thank you.
My husband looks good.
[Chuckles]
What can I say?
I used to be thin once upon a time... believe it or not.
"-Oh, BIanche."
"-Yes, it is, it is."
Or I wouldn't say it.
You just have to watch around the hips a little.
"I want you to look at my figure, you know?"
"I haven't put on one ounce in 1 0 years, stella."
I weigh now what I weighed the summer you left belle Reve.
The summer Dad died and you left us.
"It's just incredible, BIanche, how well you look."
Sure you wouldn't like another?
well....
"well, maybe I will just take one tiny nip more."
"Just to put the stopper on, so to speak."
"Now, don't get worried."
Your sister hasn't turned into a drunkard.
She's just all shaken up and hot and dirty and tired.
Waiter.
Waiter.
-You want it hot?
-ScaIding.
-stella.
"-What is it, hon?"
There's only two rooms.
I don't see where you're gonna put me.
We'II put you right here.
What kind of a bed's this?
One of those collapsible beds?
-feel all right?
"-wonderful, honey."
I don't like a bed that gives much.
"stella, there's no door between the two rooms, and StanIey--"
-will it be decent?
What a Christmas treat...
What a treat!
..if you would bust some moves to give us a...
CHEERING
"I mean, guys, anything."
"What tempo would suit you, Rhys?"
You want upbeat.
They can do upbeat.
They do nuclear.
They go very fast.
Have you got any Jive Bunny and the mastermixes?
There he goes.
FRANTIC MUSIC PLAYS
Wow!
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Thank you!
Are you on medication?
LAUGHTER No.
Everybody loves Flight of the Conchords and I loved Murray.
Your character was sublime.
Will we see more of him?
Well...
I would love to say yes and I certainly can't say no.
I'd hate to think he wouldn't be done again.
Was it something that the boys...?
Do you need half an hour to catch your breath?
"Well, you saw what I just did!"
I did that and then straight away with another question!
"""Tell us about your mother."""
All right.
"The Conchords, it started off for most audiences here as a radio show."
Yeah.
I don't know.
You're going to White Cross.
- Give me those.
"- No, no, please, please, please."
- I know where he's going to be.
- Who?
Kevin Grey.
"If Grey moors up the boat here at the end of the runway, in theory, he could just walk onto a plane."
- What's the flight schedule tonight?
- I'll get on it.
"Don't let me keep you, DS Chohan."
- How's Anna?
- She's good.
Ran into her last month at the Old Bailey.
She was on terrific form.
Tore the case apart.
Told me she'd finally left you.
- We're working things out.
"- She may be but not you, Harry."
I want DI Orwell kept up to date on everything to do with the Lau case.
You're gonna both be running it from now on.
OK?
Mm-hm.
No sign of Grey's boat.
Clear line of sight to the harbour entrance.
- How many flights are left after this one?
"- Er, two."
Athens and Paris.
The first two cities to host the Olympics.
Where does your freakish general knowledge come from?
"My dad used to sell encyclopaedias, until the internet came along."
"Harry, speedboat approaching from the harbour entrance."
Only financially.
"Well, finance is the basis of most relationships, don't you think?"
"Don't play this with me, Mr. Sabourin."
I'm a tigress.
I'll bite you.
I accept your offer.
"26th floor, miss."
Yes?
I'd like to see Mr. Sabourin.
Do you have an appointment?
"No, but he'll see me."
Just give him this.
"What is your name, please?"
Just say Kelly.
"Will you wait right here, please, Miss Kelly."
Our plan is to buy companies that are in financial trouble and then build them up.
Now here's a company in Canada that I'm particularly interested in.
Wilson Oil?
I know that stock.
Sells at a dollar.
It hasn't been very active lately.
"Well, I want you to get me the background on it and then go into the legal aspect of the situation here with Herb."
Alright.
Where is she?
In the reception room.
"Alright, show her in."
"You must forgive me, I have a private meeting."
"You may go in now, Miss Kelly."
Hello.
"Mrs. Ryan, I'd like you to meet Miss Kelly."
"Miss Kelly, Mrs. Ryan."
How'd you do?
I am serious!
"You are not my type, and... we are not suitable each other, and..."
I... don't like girl with big face!
Mr...
Mr. Chen!
I'm not talking about you.
Who did this?
Who put these porn photos inside my book?
"These are not mine, Sir!"
Really not mine!
Not mine!
It hurts!
"Sir, those are not mine really!"
I'm innocent!
Yawang!
- Yawang.
- Yes...
Do you want to earn some pocket money?
Money?
"Yes, of course!"
What should I do?
- Be a private tutor.
- For whom?
His name is Xiamu.
His father was my best friend.
"When he was 4, his father lost everything in business and committed suicide!"
"His mother could not stand the pressure from creditors, and hung herself!"
Most unfortunately little Xiamu witnessed this.
Since then he has rarely talked and become withdrawn.
"By being his private tutor, you may help this kid."
It looks like real one!
Don't be stingy!
"Well, you have your memories."
That's the best thing to keep.
Nobody can take that away.
Right?
"- Hi, Ida."
Is it okay if we come in?
- Yeah.
Vivienne is here to take you... to show you the photograph of you and your family.
Would you like to go see it?
- I'm going.
- Good.
Let's go.
Okay.
"So this is where you were thinking about the entrance, I think."
I'll show you this one.
- Okay?
- My husband's here somewhere.
"Yep, yep, yep."
"And, uh, then over here... this is Ben and Hilda Katz."
- Look over here.
- This is called the Ben and Hilda Katz Building... because they gave the $3 million to help start it.
- I knew that.
- So there they are.
And if the foundation... are going to have people here all the time who've done things for Baycrest.
So these were the first 64 people that were chosen.
And we just opened it the week before last.
- My husband's somewhere here too.
- Not on this one yet.
No.
We're going up in the auditorium to find him.
- And this is the Heritage Museum.
- Just a minute.
I sold a whole street once.
"When I had the business, your father was still alive."
Yeah.
He used to come home and go upstairs.
I had his supper ready for him on the table.
"When he came down, I went up... and I had a little - a little snack, a little supper- nothing much."
I was always very busy.
Do you remember Mr. Goldhar?
- Yep.
- He came every day.
[Woman] That must have been who she was talking about before.
"Oh, did I"
- I mentioned it already?
"Well, you were wondering ifhe was Goodman or..."
He was a very nice man...
Mr. Goldhar.
And he loved me - not in that way.
But
"- Oh, well, he - he put his arms around me."
He kissed me.
He loved me.
He laughed.
He did anything I told him to.
He came every day for breakfast.
"He was there at about, uh, 6:30, 7:00 for breakfast."
He says his wife is still sleeping.
She doesn't make him breakfast.
I remember
- I didn't think I would remember anything from there.
"I remember you came down, and you should have been sleeping upstairs."
You climbed - You used to climb out of your crib.
- Yeah?
Coffee.
Same here.
And two glasses of water.
"It's our first commercial release, so we're suspicious."
I saw the film.
And?
Nothing.
Comrades risked their lives to film it and smuggle it out.
So people know how desperate the situation is.
It's exceptional.
I didn't say I don't agree.
I totally do.
You live with Jean-René?
A house in Kremlin-Bicêtre.
With members of the collective.
The film you made in Italy...
Is it finished?
We're still debating.
Comrades find it politically questionable.
It's tense but fascinating.
I'm learning a lot.
We have an office.
"I answer the phone, tend to the prints."
It keeps me busy.
I want to go to college but I missed registration.
I may go to London.
To be a gofer on a film.
It may not work out.
What film?
Nothing like yours.
Go on.
Science fiction.
Me too.
"I think we're ready for business, Dennis."
- Sir.
- You must be very proud of your mom.
"Yeah, being the vice president is better than being the president."
"Oh, I'm sure you're right."
'Cause nobody wants to shoot the vice president.
"So, you must be feeling pretty excited about now."
Please sit.
- Hmm?
"- Well, I think I'm a little nervous."
"Well, good!"
Good.
Night before a confirmation hearing.
"Anything else, I would've withdrawn your name."
"- What about this Webster, sir?"
"- Ah, one second."
Anybody here hungry?
"- No, thanks."
"- No, sir, I'm not."
Thanks.
"Otto, could you whip up some Kung Pao chicken, but with walnuts?"
"No problem, sir."
"Ah, the kid."
Met him.
"You know this young congressman, Webster?"
"No, sir, I don't."
No matter.
He reminds me of me when I was his age.
That's bad.
"K, you need to put out word that no matter what this kid does... nobody's to give him a hard time."
"He's misguided, but he's got something."
"Well, then..."
This ought to be fun.
Pff.
Fun.
"Yeah, right."
I find myself agreeing with boss.
This looks to be a very entertaining evening.
"You know what, I just figured out what your costume is."
You came as a kiss-up!
"All right, all right."
"Buckle up, everybody."
"The quicker I scare the wits out of you lot, the sooner I can be home, cozy in my bed."
Unless anyone else thinks they've got what it takes.
Oh!
Oh!
"Pick me, pick me!"
I have a scary story!
"This isn't the one about you getting trapped in the petting zoo again, is it?"
- 'Cause that's not scary.
- Actually...
If you look at it from my perspective...
"Hey, guess what, Pinocchio, no one cares!"
"Get ready to send these jokers home, Shrek, 'cause I've got a doozy... and it's all true!"
It was a dark and stormy night...
Gingy?
My girlfriend kicked me out.
"I don't know, something about me being too into myself."
"Blah, blah, blah, yack, yack, yack."
You?
But you are so adorable.
I know!
That's what I keep telling her!
seductor!
Damn it!
"Finally, you have arrived."
From where you come?
Of the university.
-Again Alvaro?
-Yes.
You are really an idiot.
You help me?
How many times you take trying to tie to him?
Two times.
Two times?
And above you have scored at Medicine to be near him.
"Without a doubt, a medical desire much, but until Alvaro finishes the doctorate..."
"Good, to his parents they do not need money."
Money.
"To the aim to the end, they only have a bar."
But you know what bar is?
It is a Sport Bar.
-He of the place?
"-Yes, that same one."
"Ah, then he rich."
I am not idiot.
"I have to him in the loose cord,"
I will not give anything to him until we marry.
"He is not handsome, but..."
"It hears, I say it to you like expert, you you have future?"
you know?
-Where it is?
-There.
"Because in spite of being a fan, you are better than many professionals."
Modestly...
Who did you say?
"The new arc welder, I don't know his last name."
- What new arc welder?
"- Ivan, the guy from the swing shift."
Reynolds was picked up on a warrant.
This guy took his place.
"What the fuck are you talking about, Reznik?"
"Reynolds is right over there on the pit as usual, busting his ass."
"There is no Ivan in National Machine, Reznik."
What is this?
"Mr. Reznik, have you recently suffered any head injuries?"
Ever hear of pumpkin pie?
No.
- Trevor.
- Yeah.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.
Why do you go out of your way to come here every night?
Is it out of the way?
An airport?
For coffee and pie?
Suppose I went to Danni's...
Suddenly I get an overwhelming urge to skip town.
Could I do that just in any diner?
Is someone chasing you?
Not yet.
But they will when they find out who I am.
Oh really!
Who are you?
Can you keep a secret?
To the grave.
I'm Elvis Presley.
All right?
Get in the car.
What?
We're taking a little ride.
Senator.
"All right, gentlemen."
"Ah, thank you."
How are you?
Thank you for coming.
How are you?
Hi.
"We should, uh, talk to the staff about Rebecca not being able to come."
We should all be on the same page.
"- I'll get right on it, senator."
"- Hey, good to see you, senator."
"- Joe, I'm glad you could make it."
- Hey.
Yeah.
"We got those CEOs to blink, but trust me, in November, we're going to have 'em on the run."
- Senator.
"- Hey, Cathy."
- Hello.
"- Don't you worry, I promise I am going to push that through, even if I have to haul that committee into chambers myself."
Appreciate it.
Quite a turnout here.
"Thanks for hosting this, dad."
"Hey, my son, least I could do."
"You know, I would still be picking out his ties"
If he would just let me.
"Somebody needs to dress this boy, you know what I mean?"
- What's going on?
- What?
I was giving the matter my serious consideration.
"Then when I saw him sulking, Jesus!"
"He was very good-looking, though."
Very handsome.
"Not really, Mary."
Not when you got up close to him.
Beauty's only skin deep.
"It wasn't even that deep, Mary."
He'd loads of little spots on his chin.
"Tiny, little ones, now."
Millions of them!
Only noticed 'em when you were right up against them... then you want to throw up.
He was thick as well.
"Come here, Jackie."
Was he passionate?
No!
But he thought he was.
You know what I mean?
"He was just a big, thick monkey."
"Looking for somewhere to stick his banana, what?"
Ha!
Yvonne Burgess!
He stuck his tongue in me ear once... and I'm not joking yous.
He was trying to get it out the other one.
Don't know what he thought I had in there.
"His sense of direction wasn't the best, either."
- Know what I mean?
- Jackie O'Keefe!
"You're bleedin' disgusting, you are!"
"Any news, Sharon?"
No.
Not really.
"We'd like to eat, sometime this year!"
"Jude, how did the batting cages go?"
"Do we need to call the Padres, see if they need another big hit in their lineup?"
- Huh?
- I don't think so.
"Oh, come on!"
Planning my retirement.
- Bread me.
- Oh!
Guys!
"So we, uh, make an appointment yet for the hand surgeon?"
"- Uh, no."
- Why not?
"Well, I talked it all over with your father."
Is this about money or something?
Isn't that what the settlement from Vico is for?
- Fix my freaking hand?
"- No, Brandon, it's not about money."
"We just, um... we just feel that it's a little too risky, Brandon."
"And, uh... your father and I are saying no."
I don't get this.
"It's my hand, my money, my life."
And I wanna play piano again.
"Like, really play."
Why is this so hard to understand?
I want the surgery.
"Brandon, we are eating dinner."
Can we please discuss this later?
"Yeah, well, I'm not hungry."
- So you talked to Mike?
- This afternoon.
And you just... decided?
There are certain moments that define your entire life.
Moments when a shock goes through your body.
"And although you don't understand it yet, you know... from this point forward, nothing will ever be the same again."
News flash:
It ain't real.
"On the outside you might be Soccer Mom of the Year, but on the inside... it's all you can do to hold it together."
Keep up the image.
"All across America, families are hiding behind the same mask... of baseball practice, Girl Scout cookies, Harry Potter sequels... and $15 Yu-Gi-Oh!"
Cards.
"Truth is, we're all living in fear and hiding behind our SUVs."
"One of these days, the other shoe's gonna drop, honey."
It's going to drop.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Here we go.
"We""re all set."
"- Do you have a pen, please?"
"- Yes, I do."
Here you go.
How are we feeling?
- It hurts.
- Yeah.
"- What time is the soccer game, honey?"
- About 2:00 on Saturday.
- Who are you playing?
- The Cougars.
"If we beat them, we""re in the playoffs."
"Mom, can I go to the park?"
What?
Yeah.
"Oh, my!"
Look at you.
She didn't put poison in my cup.
"Well, Mrs Lightman didn't mention meeting you."
How come you've said nothing about it till now?
It's the truth.
"That woman poisoned you, so why on earth would you want to cover for her?"
She didn't do it.
Right.
Fair enough.
"I'm done here, George."
I'll stay here with Henry.
No!
Just leave me alone... all of you!
"Iris has motive, opportunity, previous, and what's more she's lied to us."
We've easily got enough.
"You've met her, Father."
Do you think she did it?
No.
But I don't know who did.
Why is Henry behaving so strangely towards me?
I don't know that either.
But let him rest.
Haven't you got an appointment this lunchtime?
"Mrs McCarthy, sorry I'm a bit late."
But I thought you were...
Inspector Mallory has arrested Iris Lightman.
And as Henry wants to be left alone...
The inspector's also arranged a car to drop us off in Cheltenham.
Oh!
"Oh, they're beautiful!"
That is very...
I'll just go and get myself ready.
There's no need.
You must be very happy.
Instead...
Why are you upset like this about this random girl?
"I know, my fault."
Sorry.
"Now, please smile for me."
I'm telling you again...
Sadhana is deeply in love with you.
When you were hospitalised...
I know.
I will talk to her.
What I meant is...
More than the one we love...
The one whom we love...
The one who loves us...
"No, no..."
It's okay.
"Leave it, mom."
I get the point.
"Have a seat, Sadhana."
Will you like to have anything?
Don't suddenly flip into a totally different person.
Be normal.
Only that suits you.
Okay.
I have to tell you the truth.
"Since you were coming, I didn't even use room freshener."
Okay.
Let me get to the point.
"If you still love her, I totally understand."
Don't take any decision just because your parents are forcing you.
You don't have to tell me 'you like me' just because someone is asking you to.
333...
A number that ends with 333.
Details of this number?
You said the the victim of the accident got calls from a number?
Is it the same number?
Let me check.
Yes.
It's the same number.
"The number we got from the lodge, Manoj's number, and this number."
There's some connection definitely.
Sir.
"Moorthy, how are you?"
- I'm fine.
Did our car met with an accident?
Why do you ask?
"The cops are torturing me, Sir."
"They are accusing me of that accident, that I drove the car."
What did you say?
That I am no longer working for you.
I told them that the lady with you drives your car.
How did you...
Why did you blabber all that?
Don't you have any sense?
- Sir!
Fool!
"Manoj, tell us the truth at least now."
Who was with you?
What actually happened?
Who is it?
The same cops who came yesterday.
Tell me what happened.
I did tell you that nothing happened.
- Yes.
Have you got something to tell me?
"Yes, I would advise you to get out of here."
- How many of them were there?
- Eight.
- Too bad that Carrasco wasn't there.
- That girl out there is also one of them.
"- Coronel, I'm in the militia."
- Calm down.
You mustn't get excited.
I know him.
It's true.
He was here before the guerrilleros occupied the hospital.
His name is Gutiérrez.
"- You were lucky, my friend."
"- Yes, but if you hadn't come..."
You're not supposed to talk so much.
Be quiet.
This is José Grenada.
He worked on the dam.
They seem to treat their prisoners quite well.
Did you hear them talk about their leader Carrasco on your way here?
Think carefully.
You must have heard something.
Very well.
I will never tell a bastard like you anything.
Never!
What are you waiting for?
Keep calm.
Don't panic.
Nothing's happened.
What have you done?
Adam!
I never meant for any of this to happen.
I was trying to save the Bank.
I was trying to fix it but Dad made so much mess.
I fucking hated him.
That's why I hated you.
"Ok, gents, let's go."
You coming?
Of course I'm coming.
Police!
Good evening!
We are the police.
Please stay calm and remain where you are.
Move away from the art
Where is the lady of the house?
"Stand aside, police!"
We have a warrant for the art.
"We are the police, stay where you are."
Thank you for your cooperation.
What's going on?
"Madame Clios... by order of Interpol, all the art is seized and you are to stay exactly where you are."
Fucking awful night.
"What doesn't kill you, et cetera..."
Monsieur!
What now?
Was it love?
It was wild Brought me to my knees

Here we go everybody!
[Singing] Come on!
You get the limo out front.
"Hottest styles, every shoe, every color."
"Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun."
It's really you but no one ever discovers.
Who would have thought that a girl like me.
A girl like me.
Would double as a superstar?
[Whooping]
You get the best of both worlds.
"Chill it out, take it slow."
Then you rock out the show.
You get the best of both worlds.
Mix it all together.
And you know that it's the best of both worlds.
[Laughing]
[Singing] Jesse's back in the band but then things got out of hand.
He gave Hannah a kiss.
Something the world didn't miss.
On Leno.
Hannah Montana was getting frozen yogurt yesterday.
Did you hear about this?
Did you hear about this?
When asked why she got both chocolate and vanilla.
She said she wanted the best of both swirls.
Did you hear about this?
[Singing] Now Mile and Jesse can't hate.
Is that a problem?
Just wait.
Lunch.
"- So what do you got today, Mel?"
"Liverwurst and Swiss, I think."
"Oh, yeah."
There's liverwurst and Swiss.
Yeah.
"All three of 'em, liverwurst and Swiss."
You wanna swap?
I got a bacon and avocado... and a tuna fish and tomato on a kaiser roll
I'll give you the liverwurst and Swiss for the tuna fish and tomato... and I'll throw in a piece of chocolate cake.
"No, you keep the chocolate cake."
"Besides, I got a piece of, lemon meringue pie anyway."
"Well, I gotta get rid of one of these sandwiches."
Toss it down the shaft.
"Oh, we have a... wastepaper basket here."
I'll throw it out.
Ah.
"Thanks a lot, fella."
That's nice of you.
Thank you.
"- Hi, honey."
"- Hi, sweetheart."
Happy birthday.
"Well, how was your day?"
"Fine, fine."
No... surprises.
I just hope it stays that way.
"Well, honey, you're really gonna be surprised, because there's no surprise party."
"- Just five friends and a nice, quiet dinner."
- Good.
Come on.
Take off your coat.
You're not wearing them?
"Difficult, considering... was it you?"
Earrings?
Tip of the iceberg...
Why tonight?
"Because, to have a fiancé who is 50% shit is too much."
Why me?
Because tonight...
I'm loaded!
"And you, do you know how to weigh or measure love?"
What are you staring at?
Your buttons.
They're all... wrong.
"I mean, you're beautiful."
Takes a lot of work.
"Courtesans yes, maids no!"
- Got a taste for it?
- Haven't we eaten?
- Was it you?
"- No, it's me."
Then strip.
"So, are you disturbing the peace?"
It's only André.
on the table!
"Time's up, oldtimer!"
You'll never make another omlet from bad eggs then snitch like you did to my father!
"These empire chairs, bit shoddy aren't they?"
Just like all empires!
Anybody moves and he gets it deeper.
You little punk!
I'll crush you as I...
"You started living the high life too soon, Joseph Venom."
- What's your problem?
- You think I have lost it?
Think about it.
- Who are you?
- What do you mean?
I mean why is Zak coming after a boring banker?
Hold on a second!
Who's boring?
"I'm a crowd puller, okay?"
- Everybody knows that.
It's nothing new.
"- Shiv, this is not funny!"
What is not funny?
I'm not being funny!
What are you saying?
All of this is connected.
Okay?
"In fact, even the comet..."
"All of this has happened before, Shiv."
You have to believe this.
I have to believe this!
"What...what...what are you saying, baby?"
"You are an educated, English speaking, modern girl who lives in Europe."
You make chocolates!
Why are you saying such strange things?
"What do I do, I don't have any proof."
"- Hey baby, what are you doing?"
- Just a second!
"Baby, you cannot use sex to make me believe."
I'm reminding you of your birthmark.
"Just think, why do you have it?"
This is where Zak had attacked you.
I volunteered you guys.
–You can't be serious.
–Your shirt's gay enough for the job.
–What do you mean you gave us to Aceveda?
What...
Great.
I've got your assignments.
"Briefing room, five minutes."
Is everything okay with Kayla?
When was the last time you saw your roommate?
–Last night around 6:00.
–She didn't come home all night?
I don't know.
I slept at my boyfriend's.
Any idea where she might have gone?
There's two million single men in L.A. Take your pick.
"We found her car in the garage, but not her purse or keys."
Is there someone close?
Somewhere she might have walked to?
Wait a minute.
Is Kayla dead?
We have every reason to believe that she's still alive.
'Cause I don't wanna be a bitch... but our rent's due next week.
–Vic.
I got great news.
–What?
Just be glad you hired me and not the brain-dead idiot your wife did.
Jerk off privately.
What do you got?
"Corrine's P.I., they're making nonsecure calls from his cell phone."
I caught one.
Found where she's at.
"- Good morning, Miss."
Here are Tommy's discharge papers.
Cutter will be very pleased about this.
- Column of threes!
- Eyes front!
Sit up straight there!
"Who do you think you are, a lot of blinking nursemaids in Hyde Park?"
Walk march!
Forward!
"Party, halt!"
"Sgt. Ballantine, take charge."
"Go inside, dear."
I'll be right with you.
"All right, but do hurry, so we can leave soon."
"- Naik, what about this?"
"- He just came back, Sergeant sahib."
"Come here, you."
"Din, I knew you was at the bottom of all this."
Didn't you knock down the shed and take off Sgt. Cutter?
You'll answer to me.
We'll have a court-martial here and now.
- Line up a firing squad.
"- Please, sahib."
"You stole the elephant, didn't you?"
Answer me!
You knocked down a building and liberated Her Majesty's prisoner...
"Sgt. Cutter, didn't you?"
"- Yes, sahib."
- That's all!
Take him away!
"You Lazarushian beggar, it'll be the firing squad for you this time!"
"Wait a minute, Mac."
- Where's the cook?
- Eating at Rosie's!
[ All Chanting ] Kill the cook.
Kill the cook!
Kill the cook!
See what you've done?
"Father, you'd better talk to them."
- Not without a whip and a chair.
- I don't blame you.
This place is a cat's whisker from loco.
- [ Chanting Continues ]
- I'll take care of this.
"Okay, hold it."
Hold it down!
"Hold it down, everybody!"
"I was hoping we could keep this a secret, but I guess now's the time to tell you."
[ Clamoring ]
My associate and I have been planning a big surprise dinner party for tomorrow night.
"Oh, yeah?"
What kind of a party?
That's the surprise.
But I guarantee you... it will be spectacularly unforgettable.
Well it better be!
It better be!
What kind of a lamebrain scheme are you two hatching?
"- Oh-ho, Colonel, that would spoil the surprise."
"- Let's go, Beej."
This I gotta see.
Don't forget-- unforgettable.
"- You don't have a thing in mind, do you?"
- Even less than that.
David?
This is the best you could come up with?
This shit?
This is shit.
Read the deposition of the LaVamere lady.
She was putting on a sex show.
- How long did this go on for?
- It was hours.
- How many hours?
- Three or four.
Which one?
Three or four?
"Three, I guess."
"In her defense, she was drunk."
"To be honest, once she finished fucking and sucking those two assholes... she was carried into another room, and boys were going in and out of there... but I don't know if she was fucking them."
"When she came out, she was covered in cum."
It was awful.
"Excuse me, Counselor."
"I, um..."
- May I?
- Of course.
"Just to clarify, why exactly was Mrs. Laine Hanson..."
Strike that.
"Laine Billings involved in this, uh... appalling and disgusting behavior?"
- That's...
That's what's important.
- Exactly.
Thank you.
It's great to see you guys.
There you go.
Thank you so much for your support.
Thank you.
Thank you.
( camera shutter clicks )
"Um, did you just take a screen grab?"
No!
Why would I take a screen grab of you?
I got the real thing.
Come on.
Okay.
Don't get lube all over your phone.
"Hike your ass up, please?"
God damn.
"Sexy, yes."
Just a little bit more.
Arch your back.
Fuck.
Damn!
Tom and Gisele floating on a 300-footer in Saint-Tropez.
"Man, that's a long-ass way from that raft we used to float on at Jim McMahon's aboveground pool."
Where you see that?
Where I see everything... 'Gram.
You follow Tom Brady?
Just so I don't look like a creep following his wife.
"Plus, he only posts pictures of him practicing and wearing them ugly-ass Uggs."
"Wait, I can't believe they let your old ass on the 'Gram, Dennis."
"Motherfucker, there's no age limit looking at fine-ass women."
Is this you with all the Pam Grier pics?
That's my Woman Crush Wednesday every day.
Because she ain't no Ashley Graham.
"And I hate to break it to you, but she ain't looking like this anymore."
"Hey, careful, boy."
That's my girl.
"And FYI, she's still fine as fuck, all right?"
- Fine...
Did all that happen when you came to get the keys?
No.
We go back a long time.
I fucked it up.
And?
It's getting too complicated.
I've decided to move out.
"Don't worry, I'll cover you for the rent."
But that's unfair.
I didn't know about you and Anna.
- You're not to blame.
- Can I stay here tonight?
I can't sleep if I have to be alone.
No hanky-panky.
Scout's honour!
"I have to go, Sophie."
Sophie's sweet caress showed me I had to break the vicious circle.
"If not, -"
- Johan and I would end up like Pierre and Sophie.
"Lonely, bitter,   spitting harsh words at each other."
I understand.
Forever seeking comfort in strangers.
(cheerful pop music)
(bluesy rock guitar)
So much for wanting to break the vicious circle.
"If Camilla was a trap, he'd walked right into it."
Told you his odds were low.
"I was never, ever going to expose myself like this again."
(nightmare music)
(Anna sobbing)
Are you OK?
Come on.
Linda Farrell.
- Why do you smell like dope?
- I've been with a patient.
- We're hooked up to Mount Sinai?
- Beating the crap out of them.
- What are you doing?
- Playing Doom II.
- How long does it take to play?
- Months.
I've done thoracotomies that were less bloody.
He doesn't understand the educational value.
"Die, bastard."
Die.
Come on!
- How are you feeling?
- Okay.
I knew you'd come.
"- Sweetie, of course we would."
- I want to go home.
Your daughter will be in the hospital at least several days.
Excuse me.
- Will both of you stay with me?
"- Of course, sweetheart."
"And, Daddy will you come back to live with us?"
- Well....
- We'll talk about that later.
How could you let her ride her bike in the rain?
- Don't blame me for this.
- Who else let her do it?
I'm doing the best I can.
If you spent more time with her and less at the office with Sarah--
The plastic surgeon will be here soon.
I think you should...
"Less talk, more action."
"Oh, this machine almost drives itself."
"Stay here, son."
"Come on, we have to find course for the dinosaur or we're useless."
"Cody, what did you do to our robots?"
"If you need them to do you want, you have to ask nicely."
"Cody, get off this channel."
It's for emergency responders only.
"Hide down, Kade."
Cody spotted the dinosaur first.
"For now, he's on the team."
Fine by me.
"Got any ideas, Cody?"
Not exactly.
But I know someone who will.
Hello.
Cody?
The Dinosaur Exhibit.
"Fine, now you're interested."
"How is that going, Graham?"
I'm almost there.
Just a little more to the right.
Preparing to lift the payload.
"Good to go, Dani."
You really think this will hold the tyrannosaur?
We'll find out.
"Keep him busy, Dad."
Dani is on her way.
"Now, how are we supposed to get that thing over here?"
Thought you'd never ask.
Incoming air support.
Lance Corporal James Finn.
Stationed at Quantico.
Went UA when his unit was shipped to Iraq six months ago.
Looks like he's got a pretty good reason for not showing.
Find out where he was buried.
DUCKY:
"It won't be far, McGee."
"Had the trip been longer, some bits would have fallen off."
"Okay, I'll check the backyard."
Scene's not going to sketch itself.
Ow!
"Perhaps it would be better if you fetched the gurney, Mr. Palmer."
I've seen all I need to see here.
"Yes, Doctor."
It's a tidy crime scene.
Quite.
It appears to be a body drop.
"A tertiary crime scene, or quaternary, or quinary..."
I could go on.
"Oh, you did."
It's an odd decorating choice.
Although the corpse does give the place a certain lived-in look.
You can see he brushed the dirt off his face.
"Oh, geez!"
Hello.
Sorry...
Nicrophorus americanus.
"Also known as ""the carrion beetle."""
"In here, you little monkey."
Yes.
A reminder that Shakespeare got it wrong.
We are not food for worms.
- What?
A fishy fin?
"- No, a Mickey Finn."
"Oh, Mumsie."
You and these Mickey Finns.
I'll have no peace until I get one from the nursing home.
What did you say?
The doctors use them on the violent patients.
Why didn't you say?
Why didn't I think of it?
- Get me some.
Plenty of them.
"- Mumsie, I was only joking."
Wait!
Sit down.
"Ethel, I have something very important to tell you."
You know how much my reputation as a writer and as a woman means to me.
"You're loved and respected the whole world over, Mumsie."
"Till now, yes."
"Ethel, many years ago, your father was in China."
Money was short.
"I was young, beautiful."
"It was easy, and so was..."
I fell by the wayside.
"So, you slipped, darling."
So do tons of people.
You found your feet again.
"For some months, I lost my head completely."
"Ethel, suppose someone found out and was threatening to expose me to the world."
What would you say?
I...
"I'd want to kill him, Mumsie."
"-That's right, you don't."
You could have torn him apart.
So why didn't you?
"Because I don't wanna be the freak for once, Dean."
I wanna be normal.
"So taking a beating, that's normal?"
Any word from Dad?
[CELL PHONE BEEPS]
He called this morning.
"He said he's going to be another week, at least."
We weren't supposed to be here this long.
At least you've got Amanda.
She's cool.
"Dude, she wants me to meet her parents."
I don't do parents.

"Mr. Winchester, can I talk to you?"
"Um, I'll wait for you outside."
"Look, if this is about the fight, I didn't start it."
"Oh, no, it's not about the fight, Sam."
"You know this assignment was nonfiction, right?"
"Yes, Mr. Wyatt."
"So you and your family killed a werewolf last summer, huh?"
"Why would you write something like this, Sam?"
It doesn't matter.
"As soon as my dad gets back, we're leaving."
-So you can flunk me if you want to.
-I'm not flunking you.
I'm giving you an A.
Aside from the werewolf is that really how you describe your family?
Yeah.
Bad leg?
You haven't got any skill in your fingers.
"How's your castaway getting along then, Doctor?"
"Pretty bashed about a bit, actually, Jon."
God knows where he came from.
Bugger doesn't speak a word of English.
"He isn't from around here, that's for sure."
[Men laughing]
"Christ Almighty, Lukey!"
What the hell's the matter with thee?
[Ursula]:
When did Dr. Mead say he'd be here?
When he's finished his surgery.
So what do people from Poland have for breakfast?
Probably some awful kind of sausage.
But I'm sure porridge will do him much more good.
We'll soon find out.
Nothing wrong with his appetite.
- Glad to hear it.
Are the sisters of mercy in attendance?
"Yes, we are."
"Good morning, Doctor."
Shall we go up?
"Morning, Janet."
I'm glad to see that bruise.
"Doesn't look very pretty, but better it's there than not."
"Eh, nurse?"
What's his temperature?
- It's a little over.
Make sure he drinks lots of water.
"So, Polish, is he?"
It would appear so.
You should've called me yesterday.
Who the hell is this person you're meeting?
"Okay, can I ask you a favor then?"
Can I bring my girlfriend along?
- Girlfriend?
- Yes.
You want to take your girlfriend?
We were supposed to go on a date today.
"Sure, fine then."
Then I'll be right back.
"I'll go tidy things up a bit, and I need to call her."
"Alright, what time then?"
- How about two?
- Two?
"Okay, two then."
Hold on.
- Hello?
"- Director Kim, it's me."
- How are you?
"- Fine, of course."
Did you happen to read the paper this morning?
It said that a film director named Kim died in a car accident.
And so I called just in case.
I felt awful because of that.
So you're alright?
That was in the morning paper?
Interesting.
"- Anyhow, I wonder who it was."
"- Someone, I guess."
"- So, is the script almost done?"
"- Uh, well..."
"Actually, I was just taking off to somewhere quiet to work on it."
Eh?
Aw!
Christ!
A dead sheep?
Hm.
Not strictly Russian ?
", but certainly can't live on crusts and straps."
So I'm going to roll it up and make him some bowl.
Lucky fellow.
"Well perhaps your sister would like to start feeding me too, unless of course you actually found me some work."
So.
Baker's outlined for the Dunkirk film.
You read it?
It rattles along better rather than one might've expected.
Johnnie's escaped from the steel thrust of the German war machine.

Here!
No.
"No, no, no."

How boring.
How could you do this?
And you?
You are worse than a traitor.
You're a murderer who's going to kill all the people who won't be able to leave through this door anymore.
They promised to let me go to the future.
"We have you, fräulein."
We don't need him.

Bridgette loves working at the library.
She doesn't even mind the fact
That you can't really talk in there.
Will hate to see it end.
Meets all kinds of interesting people.
Even helped a nice young girl set up an e-mail account.
Hmm?
"Come on, bridgette dubois, librarian at large?"
Isn't that good for at least a smile?
Hmm.
"Well, I guess not."
"Hey, come on, I mean..."
"I just, I can't stand the thought of this monster getting away with this,"
"The thought of devalos losing his job, his license."
"Look, I know he made a mistake,"
"But the truth is, if that had been one of our daughters,"
I would've done the same thing.
I think he showed remarkable restraint
In not murdering the son of a bitch.

It's easy.

Wow.

- With mold?

We can't until we get them poles up and this wire strung.

Whoever's been playing tricks with this village is blinking clever.
I couldn't find a trail or a single footprint leading in or out.
"So the village isn't quite deserted, eh?"
"- Salaam, sahib."
- Who are you?
What are you doing?
My name is Pandu Lal.
I'm a miserable seller of trinkets.
"Last night a band of dacoits raided this village, looted my shop... and stole off with my poor wife and six children."
The children are looking bonny.
"Come on, everybody, in the other room."
"Go on, get up."
On the double.
Get in there.
You heard me!
Quick!
That's right.
Go on.
That's better.
- What's that?
"- Trinkets, sahib."
Only what I could save from my pitiful stock.
- Worth hardly a few annas.
"- Go on, open them up."
Who are these playful subjects here?
What did you think of yourself?
Angel?
I lifted them for your sake.
"Now you can marry her, or just keep her."
Brother!
What's this you have done?
You have crossed all limits.
You showed your standings.
"You have misunderstood me, Sheen."
Stop your performance.
What did you think?
You will gain me like this?
"Faiz, this was a big mistake by you."
Victory is not in forcing.
Victory is in defeating hate.
Well!
You and your brother won't understand this.
These are professional killers.
Might have lifted up even the women your family.
Be in your limits and speak!
You speak badly about our women?
"Step away, brother!"
Move!
What are you doing?
What are you all doing?
Leave me.
I will shoot her.
"Making fusses, bloody!"
"What else can be expected of you, Impotent?"
"Stop it, girl!"
You call us Impotent?

I'd be happy to show you around.
Right.
Please follow me.
"- Go, go, go!"
"Quick, come on."
- Move.
"- Grab these ones, too."
- What are they doing in here?
Riley said I can't keep it up in my room any more.
- You can't keep it in the freaking kitchen.
- This is our common area.
"And as you can see, we keep a very tight cleaning schedule here at the house."
"We also like to focus on and stress education, music..."
Hot soup coming through!
"The kitchen, where we provide a well-balanced diet."
They're his pets.
Rescue rats.

They're very clean for rats.
"Hi, I'm Randy Webb, home director."
I see you've met Furry and Scurry.
"Wonderful, lovely creatures, I assure you."
"This is not good, Mr Webb."
Not good at all.

"- You betcha, Ms Frazier."
Excellent.

No time for changes now.
The act hasn't been announced yet.
- But we're set on it.
- You can change your minds.
"Can't you see the place is packed, Barbuda?"
They're all here to see our act.
"Come on, Marcelo."
- He can't make you do this.
"- Don't go, Marcia."
- Is Maria in this?
"- Of course not, she's out."
"It's time, Marcelo."
"We'll be watching from the front row, okay?"
Come on.
I'll never leave the circus again.
I'll be with you.
"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls."
Keep your hearts in check.
"At last, we have come to our finest attraction."

"What ""regulations""?"
"Lockout devices must be in place during the cleaning and maintenance of all heavy machinery."" OSHA, 1989."

"Congratulations, Reznik."
Youjust made my Shit List.
She's copping his joint.
"He starts telling' her ""baby this"" and ""baby that"", chatting' her up like motherfuckin' Barry White."
"Tellin' her what he wants to do, and how he's gonna make the coochie feel and all that."
- That's right.
- So dig.
"She's stops, she looks up at him with these big puppy dog eyes and she's all: ""that sounds good puppy but me no have no coochie..."""
And the brother's like:
"""Say what?"""
And he looks down and sees that she is really a he!
"Man, that's bullshit."
You telling me the ho's wearing a thong and the fool can't tell the difference?
"She had a tuck job, man!"
"Come on, Jonesy."
You know how they do it!
- You might.
I don't.
"- Yeah, wathever..."
"Ei, Reznik?"
You up for some cards tonight?
Can't.
Got plans.
Shit.
Nigga says the same damn thing every poker night.
"What's up with you, man?"
You used to be all right.
And if she stays here?
Did she ever talk to you about a DNR?
Are you saying she's dying?
*****
"Guy,ready?"
"Hey,buddy.How you doing?"
Where'd you come from?
Get back!
"Move,move,get out of the way!"

"Oh,this does not look good."
- You were actually near where...
"- um,yeah,no,it was just right there."
- Was it over here?
- The south side.
Okay.

Something small.An l.E.D.maybe.
Looks like he used the grass to hide them.
Land mines.

"Mom, you're not a professional, leave it up to the pros!"
You're being completely rude!
"Rudeness is momentary, pictures are forever."
"It's fine, right Mr. Choi?"
"Yes, are you ready now?"
"The kids are going to get tired, stop it."
"Ahjumma, please take my mom to a cafe or something."
We won't even get one good photo because of mom.
What?
We're going to be spending the entire night like this.
And my feet hurt.
You think you'll get anything with no suffering?
Endure it!
You think I'm doing this because I have an excess of strength?
Let's go.
"Let's go and drink some tea, and get some fresh air."
There's no need for us to be here.
Are you the only one whose feet hurt?
You think I like doing this?
Ma'am!
"I'm sorry, Oppa."
Let's start.
All right.
ORWELL:
Trouble in the dream team?
(BANG)
I should never have bought it for her.
It's too big.
The bike was fine.
She loved it.
Come on!
ANNA:
"Sit down, Harry."
You look thin.
"That's a good thing, eh?"
"No, thin like you're not eating properly."
Oh.
"Yeah, I don't have time to go to fancy restaurants like you."
- Are we going to do this now?
- Good night for a date.
- Our tenth anniversary.
- How do you know it was a date?
I just wanted to see you.
"I haven't asked you anything about whether or not you're seeing anyone else and I'm not going to, Harry, cos I just can't."
He's a friend.
- Oh...
- And a divorce lawyer.
- What?
"- I'm worried, Harry."
I don't want to lose anything else after the house.
So that's what you were discussing with your friend the divorce lawyer over dinner?
"That's very convenient for him, eh?"
"- You're still gambling, aren't you?"
- What?
Aren't you?
"A good soldier should forget his past, and realize that he might not have a future, because he fights every day as though it were his last."
"Really, Alonso, when it comes to inspiring people you are one of a kind."
Come on.
I dont understand.
The place where we they're meeting us is...
It's two blocks from here.
"Also, coincidentally, they're meeting us in my neighborhood."
"Please, can you give me something?"
It's to eat.
Yes.
Here you are.
Thank you.
I've never seen such poverty.
The War had just ended.
People were hungry and there wasn't much food.
just what they got with their ration card.
My grandfather told me.
How everything has changed.
Hey.
I could swear that's you.
When I left home yesterday it was half-painted.
It was going to go in the sitting room.
Should we go in and ask?
No.
We have a mission to complete.
(WHISPERS) He's late for the Angelus.
Here.
Let's go.
I'm sorry.
-Is Lola working with the Nazis?
Impossible.
She is saving lives and risking her own.
"Whatever you are doing, you drop it."
Governor McCallum is going to Charleston.
Then he's touring that chemical plant in Point Pleasant today.
"Now, I want you to go down there... and meet him at the airport."
You listening?
"Yeah, McCal I um at the chemical plant."
Got it.
I need to know that you're gonna be there.
"John, are you there?"
Ohio.
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.
I can't call in sick just because you have a bad feeling about today.
Just think about this.
Gordon saw weird lights in the sky.
They show up over the chemical plant.
"Josh gets a call from me, but it's not really me."
I'm talking about something bad happening at the chemical plant.
Then I get this message from this Indrid Cold... who's talking about a great tragedy on the Ohio River.
Guess what's on the Ohio River.
The chemical plant.
Today Governor McCallum is gonna be there.
I was on myway to interview him.
That's how I ended...
That's how I ended up here.
My God.
That's why I'm here.
He was right.
Who was right?
You saw Leek.
- He was part of the warning.
- What?
"She sparks every time, she does."
"That rifle does you credit, Hagman."
"Thank you, Mr Sharpe."
Oil sir
The secret is not to spare the oil.
So General Wellesley says.
Aye.
Ow!
Damn knee!
"Old leg wound, Hagman."
Rain plays the devil with it.
Aye.
Brown paper and paraffin oil is the only cure for a contrary leg.
I has a contrary arm on account of an argument with a French hussar...
"Oh, bugger it!"
...which we had at the Battle of Vimieiro.
"And which argument he lost, on account of me blowing his head off his neck."
But it do itch fierce of a rainy day.
And I find nothing work s so well as paraffin oil and best brown paper.
- Aye.
"- Oh, aye."
?
Gentle Spanish guitar
"She's beautiful, is she not?"
Yes.
You never loved a woman?
No.
Not after I paid for it.
So she's like no woman you ever met?
I think you should try to forget her.
"Because, you see she's no longer a woman."
She was the best student in Salamanca.
What?
"Pauline, I'm in a meeting, you lardy trout!"
Wh...?
Insurance?
Hop it.
I just wanted a quick word with you about Enid and myself.
What are you talking about?
"Pauline, get Roberts."
Enid and I are in love.
"'Yes, we're in love.'"
'And why are you telling me?
'
Because I have to assume that you have feelings for her as well 'and that you want the best for her.'
'Are we talking about Enid Sutcliffe?
' 'Yes.'
Why do you think I care one way or the other about her?
Because I know what the situation is.
"Get out of here, you fat fool."
Coming shouting the odds in your cheap suit.
No-one's shouting.
"Can we not shake hands, like gentlemen, for Enid's sake?"
Enid's nothing to me.
"She's a spinster with a crush, that's all, whatever she's told you."
How dare you.
You've had what you've wanted for years and years and you say she's nothing to you?
You're despicable.
Tubby!
Ha-ha-ha!
Come with me!
You'll stay where you are if you want to keep your job.
"I love you, Enid!"
And don't let him back in!
- He is stunt man..
How long you knew him?
- I knew since my childhood.
By the way who are you?
What do you want..?
Police..
Yes Sudhakar.
Sir his name is Karthik..
He is Stuntman..
Okay..
Thank you.
What his dad said was correct.
There is another person looking like him.
But we cannot take chance.
Hello sir..
I am sending a photo.
Hack the IB main server and check whether he is there in the employee data base.
His name is Vikram Kumar.
IPS 2012 batch.
Thanks Stephen.
"Confirmed, both are different."
- Strange!
Hello sir..
"As said by you, they hacked and searched the IB server for you."
We created your ID as an IB officer.
They confirmed that I'm a police officer via audio.
Now I'll show them the video.
Why are you still here?
Have you not still caught him?
My target is to catch you.
- Will you call Chairman Sir informally?
Inquiries should be done on criminals like you and not on Police like me.
"And, Bruce, we really wanna wish you well."
I thought they gave you grounds privileges.
They did.
It's not much of a privilege unless you use it.
So you're really leaving?
"Well, my insurance ran out, so I guess so."
Are you ready?
Do I have a choice?
You cold?
Oh.
"Uh, a little."
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.
"- God, this feels so normal."
- Hm.
Is that crazy?
"You thinking the law library was haunted, that's crazy."
"This is, um..."
This is fine.
What's it like?
- What?
- Just hearing the voices.
"Oh, um..."
It sucks.
"Well, what does it feel like?"
Because I just picture it like there's a radio on in your head or something.
"Um, no, it's not in my head."
It's...
I actually hear them with my ears.
"Like people standing behind me, or beside me or creeping up."
Sometimes it's just one.
And then sometimes it's so many that I can't sort out the voices from my actual thoughts.
"That's surprising, isn't it?"
Considering all the money he makes.
"I never question good fortune, Lieutenant."
All I know is that getting along with Ward Fowler is gonna be a lot easier from now on.
What about a drink?
That's amazing how she kept it from you.
Well she did.
I just found out about it.
"Yes, sir, I know."
Your accountant told me.
Oh.
"Well, good."
"Then that's it, huh?"
"Yes, sir, that's it."
"Oh, there's one more thing, sir."
Mr. Hart is in Rome.
He's gonna be back in his hotel room in a little while.
"Before I talk to him, were you really playing chess the other night?"
"Lieutenant, let's get it straight right now."
I was not with Leo Hart the other night.
"But I wasrt busy killing my wife, either."
(BUZZER SOUNDING)
"Yes, Mr. Daley?"
SID:
"Molly, would you come in for a minute?"
I need your help.
"Molly, would you please tell Lieutenant Columbo where I was on Thursday evening, the night my wife was killed?"
The truth.
"Mr. Daley was with me, Lieutenant."
We left the office together and we were together in my apartment until the next morning.
It's the truth.
"Yes, madam."
Where's the server?
It's the Isis foundation.
It's 3rd and Broadway.
It's a 10-minute drive.
I'll come back for you when I'm done.
You're really bleeding.
I guess... trying to take on one of Lex Luthor's fembots doesn't make me the smartest icicle in the freezer.
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get us out of here.
Is anyone out there?
!
Is anyone in there?
!
Help!
Can anyone hear me?
!
- Jimmy and Lois here?
"- Not yet, but Jimmy's message said he already sent the files, I was about to get started."
I got a message that Lionel left for me in his vault.
I think I know why he was killed.
He was trying to protect me.
Lionel did say something terrible was coming.
There's something on earth that can be used to control me.
Control you?
"As in ""do my bidding,"" like some sort of puppet?"
What could possibly pull your strings?
I don't know.
"But whatever it is, it takes two keys to unlock."
"When I went back to the Daily Planet tonight, there was a key in my desk."
Lionel left it there for you.
Where is it?
Lex took it.
- Are my little chickies still hungry?
- Yes.
Peep.
"Okay, worm check."
Open up.
Are there anyworms left in there?
You live next door to me.
"- No, I don't."
- I saw you moving in.
You have a white dad and a big brother.
Your whole family lives in one ofthose little apartments?
Do you all have to sleep in the same bed?
My mom lives somewhere else.
You should get a Hide-a-bed.
During the day it's a couch... but at night it folds out into a comfortable queen-sized bed.
You want to be a little bird and get a littleworm?
Just lie down and peep.
"Peep, peep, peep."
Are you following us?
"Yeah, quit following us, Peter Swersey!"
"If you don't stop following us, I'm gonna scream!"
"Ifyou take another step towards me, I'm going to kickyou in the throat!"
"Hey, come here."
Ask her if she likes bologna.
What are you putting?
"I asked herwhat kind of ""bossom"" she had."
- It's probably a man.
- Why is it a man?
'Cause everyone just makes stuff up on these things.
It's probably a man pretending to be a woman.
So picture a fat guy with a little wiener.
"- What's a ""bossom""?"
"No need for such pessimism, Hugues."
Thing's aren't rosy.
"But it's the right decision, Jeanne, and I'm sorry."
"Jean-Pierre, we know this should have happened a year ago, and I myself..."
You what?
I've a plan to make the redundancies go smoothly.
May I know who's leaving?
I can't tell you yet.
It's not yet official.
Is that all?
Oh!
Wait!
There.
"You have a good team, it seems."
"- So, that's it?"
- Yes.
- Do you know who's going?
- They wouldn't say.
"It's not official, right?"
"Don't worry, we'll fight."
I'm not worried.
I must tell you...
"I couldn't say with Maillet there, but you're on the list."
- Me?
- Yes.
"I'm really sorry, believe me."
But you're probably the luckiest.
Or rather...
The least unlucky.
"Given your age and the relocation rules, you'll be able to take early retirement, and get your leaving bonus, of course."
You're relocating...
"It's a chance for you, Jeanne."
"Hi, Mrs. Donovan."
Yeah.
"Okay, well, we're gonna be late."
- So let's just get going.
- Yeah.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Good.
Damon hasn't said a word to me.
"Every time I try to talk, he shuts me down."
- Think he's trying to find Katherine?
- I don't know.
He waited 145 years only to find out that Katherine could not care less.
"And it's gotta hurt, right?"
And it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
- You have every reason to be upset.
- Mm-hm.
- What are you gonna do?
- About what?
"Isobel, my vampire birth mother, who's related to my ancestor, Katherine who screwed over your brother?"
Nah.
I haven't thought about it at all.
I'm sorry I brought it up.
It'd be nice if we could get through a day without having to deal with it.
No vampire mother or brother...
No vampires at all?
No vampires but you.
I just wanna get us back to normal stuff like school and homework.
Fun.
"Ooh, that sounds good to me, when do we start?"
We can watch a movie at my place.
It's a text from my Agent.
Entertainment weekly and in style magazine... both want me.
"Oh, and, and also, the flett-giordano syndrome foundation... want to come and meet with me here."
"Oh, well, this will just legitimize the hell out of it."
What kind of disease is it?
I-I don't know.
Elka?
"You know, I'm, I'm happy to lie to win, but I-I don't wanna lose my hair or anything."
- The only symptom is fatigue.
- That's perfect.
"I mean, I can play tired in my sleep."
"Ah, luckily, this disease hasn't affected my wit."
"Oh, that's will."
My baby's here.
"Hi, honey!"
"- Hi, just a sec."
- Okay.
It's good to see you.
"- Good to see you, sweetie."
- Yeah.
The facial hair makes you look a little...
"Foreign, but cute."
Come on in.
You know joy and Victoria.
- Both:
"Hey, will."
- Hi.
"Ah, this is Elka Ostrovsky."
"Nice to meet you, will."
Nice to meet you too.
"Well, your mom picks up and moves to Cleveland."
You must have a million questions.
Thank you.
I'll drive up to Joe's Cabins.
I'll take a look at the junction.
"Yeah, I-I'm Reed."
Latham Reed.
"But you might as well know now, Mr. Mason, I-"
- I just can't remember.
What can't you remember?
"Here, sit up."
Nothing.
"From that moment yesterday afternoon when Somers offered me a highball and I said no, make mine lemonade."
Thought it tasted funny - for lemonade.
Used to be an alcoholic.
For three years I didn't touch a drop.
Didn't even smell a cork.
I'll kill that Somers.
Someone already has killed him.
Yeah.
Edie told me.
First good news I've had since she brought me to.
Where did she find you?
Mmm.
You'll have to ask her that when she comes back with more coffee.
"You took a certified check yesterday, isn't that right?"
"A check for $50,000?"
A check that Somers asked you to deliver and endorse over to a hospital fund?
How should I know?
"When she found me, she said that I had $7,000 in $500 bills."
- Now-- - [door opens]
Now what?
"I couldn't spot her, Perry."
"No sign of Axel, either."
"Mmm, yummers."
"He reminds me of Scotty on ""General Hospital."""
"No, ew, Jenna, do not like that man."
That is a bad man.
"God, you have a gift."
Laura Bush is your size.
[Exhales sharply]
Excuse me.
Hi.
What are you doing down here?
I'm known for being hands-on.
Clearly.
"That's how you should dress for work, by the way."
"Yeah, if I was president of the Philippines."
"Now, Afghanistan is a different situation."
[Indistinct conversations]
I'll have an apple juice.
"We don't have apple juice, sir."
Then I'll take a vodka and tonic.
"Hi, I'm Liz Lemon."
I know who you are.
I thought there was a strict dress code at this place.
I do recommend the pumpkin ravioli.
They're very subtle.
"So, Tracy, this Jack Donaghy guy wanted me to talk to you about joining the cast of our show, and I don't know how you feel about that..."
"Let me ask you a question, everybody at this table."
"Did he just say the word ""pumpkin"" to me?"
"Yes, um, pumpkin ravioli."
Yo!
I'm buggin'.
I can't do this.
I cannot eat here.
I need a lawyer!
I want my lawyer!
- Oh.
"- Don't shout, Richie."
It oscillates the atmos and rattles my phlegm.
- I've found you a lawyer.
- Oh.
Met him outside.
Known him for years.
Spurty.
"- Pervy Sir Peter Spurty, QC."
- Mm.
"Bit of luck him being here, really."
He'll get anyone off if you buy him a dirty mag.
Remember when the Tory cabinet were found in that brothel discussing declining moral values?
Clear as a bell.
Pervy Sir Peter Spurty got them off.
Right.
He's the man for us.
Bring us our lawyer!
We demand Pervy Sir Pete.
"- In there, Spurty."
"- Blimey, that was quick."
"Well done the police, say I."
Why do left-wingers keep sniping at them?
"If you don't wanna get beaten up, you shouldn't be poor."
"Richie, shut up."
"Watcha, Spurty."
"Me and my mate are in a bit of a fix and are gonna do five to ten in the slammer unless you can stitch the jury, rig the judge and buy off the pigs with a kickback."
Eddie.
"Please, please, please."
"This is England, Eddie."
The proof of the pudding is in the eating!
Five years ago misfortune struck me and I lost a child.
- But now you're already seven months pregnant.
- Just so!
This time I want to know for sure.
Doctors are just men and have no idea what goes on inside us.
Come on...
Bruno?
Why are you snooping around here?
"It smells so strange here, all the way out to the courtyard."
It's Lisol.
It smells healthy!
"No, it reeks..."
"like in hospital, as when mother had our baby."
Why are you mopping up here?
So that you have something to ask.
Here!
This is women's work.
Hah!
"Whenever you want something from me, I'm a lady to Mr Bruno!"
But when I want something from you...
What do you want from me?
Nothing at all!
It looks so different here.
I've fixed it up so I can sleep here.
Sleep?
Yes...
I'm not telling anyone...
"A real little room, something like that is what I've always wished for."
With a mirror...
"But to sleep here alone, Bruno..."
I would have been afraid to.
What's he doing now?
Elias ...
Mama would know.
Mama could see him.
She would know what he's doing.
"No, Elias."
Don't!
"Elias, don't!"
"Elias, do you hear me?"
Help!
"Oh Lord, watch over them."
with eyes that never doze.
He sees you and loves you.
He sees you and loves you.
The Oracle's words stand as a warning.
A prophecy.
Sparta will fall.
All of Greece will fall.
And Persian fire will reduce Athens to cinder.
"For Athens is a pile of stone and wood... and cloth and dust and, as dust, will vanish into the wind."
Only the Athenians themselves exist.
And the fate of the world hangs on their every syllable.
Only the Athenians exist.
And only stout wooden ships can save them.
Wooden ships and a tidal wave of heroes' blood.
"Leonidas, my husband"
"Leonidas, your king"
Leonidas and the brave 300 are dead.
The free men and women of Greece are not bound by a beautiful Spartan death.
War is not their love.
Yet he lay down his life for them.
Just...
You wanna go?
Go on your bike.
"Yeah, yeah, go on your bike."
Fucking hell.
Sometimes it's easier just to say yes.
"Henry, catch!"
"God, I thought I lost you forever, Henry."
I was so scared.
I was so scared when you fell.
I thought I would never see you again.
"I love you, Henry."
I love you.
How sweet.
"If I took this moment and put it in a cup of tea,"
I wouldn't need sugar.
"Yuri, pozhaluysta."
"Each year, 100,000 baseball bats are sold in Russia and, at most, 50 baseballs."
Gives you an idea of a great Russian pastime.
This is a rare surviving bat.
Estelle.
Would you please be so kind and stand up?
Or do you want to take her place?
"Estelle, your boy's quite the white knight, sacrificing himself to keep you alive only for my dick... to kill you later."
"Are you sure, Henry?"
Are you sure?
Brilliant!
"Uh, come over here, Henry."
"Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, Henry."
You... little... pussy.
"Give peace a chance, brothers."
My ego wants to kill you but my higher self doesn't.
"I'd like to ask one, too."
"What is it, mr."
Collins?
How long will it take them boats to go from new york to bristol?
"Overnight, mr."
Collins.
Just overnight.
"Oh, excellent, excellent."
"Yes, well, just a moment, mr."
"Maybury, i'll have mr."
Fisk answer that question.
"Oh, mr."
Fisk- mr.
Maybury would like to know if all 6 of the new boats will be taken from this model.
"Oh, of course not."
Each one is to be larger and more luxurious than its predecessor.
"Well, tell mr."
Maybury i'll come in and explain the details myself.
Thank you.
"Oh, would you mind coming back a little later?"
"Oh, i don't mind waiting."
Patience is its own reward.
Make yourself at home.
"It seems to me, mr."
"Palmer, that nothing, nothing can be too fine for our clientele."
I?
s working.
"Gentlemen, i think we'd better close this transom."
The enemy is right here in our camp.
He's nibbling.
"Let me take a peek, jim."
He don't look like no big fish to be- he looks more like a sidewinder crab!
(mutters)
Smells mighty familiar.
Krammar's Delicious Mystery Appetizer!
"All right, where is she?"
- Where is she?
!
"Alice, come out here!"
-Uh... upstairs on the phone.
"Upstairs on the phone, huh?"
Today was the most humiliating day
-I've ever spent in my whole life.
-Really?
How would you feel if you gave your boss dog food to eat?
"Terrible, unless my boss is a cocker spaniel, I tell you."
Dog food!
It's a miracle I wasn't fired.
"I know who did it, too."
Alice's mother.
"She come over here to cook me a tidbit, that's what she did."
"She don't care what Alice gives me to eat, just as long as Alice can scrimp and save and live around here in the lap of luxury!"
"Those ain't the facts, Ralph."
Those ain't the facts.
"They're not the facts, huh?"
Then why would we have dog food around the house?
And in our ice box?
!
"What, have we got a dog or something?"
"Ralph Kramden, you have just reached the first plateau!"
What are you talking about?
!
"I'm not talking about it, and I'm not saying it."
Just put your nose in that bedroom there.
"""When I came in to open up one morning..."
"""you had your head half in the toilet."
Your hair was in the toilet water.
"-""Disgusting."""
"-I told you, I had the flu."
-I said my piece.
"-Great, I can't even defend myself, now?"
-No one's attacking you.
-It doesn't change anything.
But I can verify that he was sick for a little while.
This thing with the dog.
How could you not see it on the chair?
You're getting emotional.
That's because I know what it's like to lose a pet!
I happen to know that you were high at my mother-in-law's wake.
"You were talking non-stop for 20 minutes, nothing but gibberish."
My mother's wake.
Jesus Christ.
-You want to read your statement?
-I don't write nothing down.
So I'll keep this short and sweet.
You're weak.
You're out of control.
You've become an embarrassment to yourself and everybody else.
-Listen to you.
-Guys.
"We said ""non-judgmental."""
Fuck that.
Let him take his medicine.
"Seriously, you want to talk about fucking up?"
"-Watch it, Chrissy."
-What?
"Don't sell it, you owe us."
So find someone who knows how to cook it.
Son of a bitch!
Get out of here or I'll peg you in the head!
- Find anything?
"- No, nothing."
In the well?
Garbage.
"Tie up the geese, I need to take a leak."
Abelardo!
"Abelardo, come here!"
Carmen.
Estrellla.
"Go back to the oar, I forgot my notebook."
- Where was that?
- Back there.
Then why are you putting it here?
- With the other stuff.
- What stuff?
The pile.
All together so nothing gets lost.
I'll put it back if you want.
"No, leave it there."
Don't touch anything else.
Write this down.
"""Apart from the breasts..."
"""Several cuts, apparently stab wounds."
"First degree burn on the left hand."""
Let's move to the other body.
"Write down that she has cuts across her neck, abdomen and thorax."
Three fingers cut off on her left hand.
Signs of vaginal injury.
Are you Sicilian?
"No, I'm Calabrese."
"We're practically paisan, do me this favor."
I already rented it!
I'll look like an idiot.
"Besides, the new tenants pay more rent."
How much more a month?
Five bucks.
Here's six months increase in advance.
But don't tell her about it.
She's very proud.
Come see me in another six months.
"Of course, the dog stays."
Right?
The dog stays.
Who the hell are you to come give me orders?
Watch out or I'll kick your Sicilian ass right into the street!
Do me this favor.
I won't forget it.
Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me.
They'll tell you I know how to return a favor.
What a character!
That landlord is here...
"Roberto, the one who owns those ratholes."
He's been asking all around the neighborhood about you.
"I hope I'm not disturbing you, Don Vito."
"What can I do for you, Don Roberto?"
What a misunderstanding!
Holy Mary!
Of course Signora Colombo can stay!
I'm giving back the money you gave me.
"Un, due, three, four, five, six, tutt'!"
I guess you never leave here.
These savages and cowards only hunt the weak.
"Noah admits, 're dead meat."
"No, we are emperor penguins."
-With pride.
We looked into the eyes of the hungry but not surrender.
Even surrounded by walls of ice will not be defeated!
"That's how you talk, Noah!"
"We are courage, we are brave."
We are the glorious Empress nation.
"Erik, stay low."
-Mano?
-They are good.
"Gloria, behind you!"
"Get someone its size, coward."
"Do not worry, Princess."
I'll get you first.
While chilled before they become hard and rotten.
Boadicea.
This is my daughter!
What smart!
"The union of nations, This is what solidarity is."
"Well, now what?"
"Now, they managed a stay of execution."
Who are you?
-A idiot.
Thank you.
"Bo, you got it."
"Hello friends, you came."
Sure we have come.
Told Us.
-Where is Ramon?
In this forest... he pursues you!
- Shit!
- What the hell...?
Welcome to the area of death.
The energies are useless here.
Who says it?
The magnetic field.
Download charged particles.
So Trajan was wrong?
Shit!
I do not give up!
"Hatta, let's flank it."
You're hurt?
Of course not...
I can not say the same thing about Trajan's partner.
Bill Carson.
"You found old Bill, huh?"
He was a Spartan-5.
And a friend.
"Establish a perimeter, we'll camp here."
And give him a decent funeral.
Ash has something special.
I have something for him.
"We walked together, side by side."
He waited to see me fall.
I never fall
I wanted to inoculate his black blood.
"I'll find you, Ash!"
Because you messed with the wrong gangster!
"Why do you always read the same book, Kix?"
What makes it so special?
"""Men do not perish in the results of lost wars,  But the loss of that resistance force"
The victims are all over the map.
"Four men, three women."
Different ethnicities and ages.
Each of the victims had something removed...
"An ear, an eye, a finger."
Why?
What's the significance of that?
There is none.
"And because of the randomness, no one was able to connect the murders."
"Until Phillip Harris, of course."
So Phillip was right.
A serial killer's been hunting in L.A. and New York for three years completely under the radar.
All this way for a dead end.
"Oh, it might be for the best."
Ignorance is bliss.
"No, ignorance is hell."
Mr. Castle.
The GDS is requesting my presence at headquarters.
This must mean I passed their test and they want me to join their ranks.
"I hate to burst your fanboy bubble, but how do you know this is on the up-and-up?"
Is this on the up-and-up?
"Yes, sir."
What are you doing?
Watching your back.
Oh.
"Uh, we have..."
Hello.
"Mr. Castle, Ms. Shipton. [Door closes]"
It's a pleasure to meet both of you.
I'm Mason Wood.
What a pleasure.
I cannot even believe I'm here.
"Uh, excuse me."
Is there an OrangeJulius stand on this floor?
I'll sell you this one.
It's almost full.
Why don't I drink out of a toilet bowl?
He'll be back.
"As for your case, don't you worry."
"I've argued in front of every judge in the state, often as a lawyer."
[ Slurping ]
This court rules in favor of Montgomery Burns.
I find that he is clearly the boy's biological father.
[ Happy Chattering ]
"Uh,Judge, these won't be ready until Thursday."
"You know, we should really stop hiring him."
[ Whistle Tooting ]
- Cool train.
Where does it go?
- Beats me.
But it won't be back for three hours and 40 minutes.
- Once it had snow on it.
"- Wow, Bart!"
Mr. Burns gives you everything you could ever want.
My parents use that old love excuse to screw me out of toys.
"Well, I'm sure you'd like to be alone with your possessions."
"Um, Milhouse, if you stay a little while longer... you can have this blazer."
- It's a Bob Mackie original.
- Wow!
A Bob Mackie!
"Uh... sorry, Bart."
[ Groaning ] Oh.
"Bartholomew, you don't need him."
I can be your school yard chum.
He has the sight problem.
Prestige problem to wear spectacles.
Where is your husband?
He has the ego problem.
He doesn't come unless called.
Hubby!
"Suzuki Subramanyam alias Tukaram, He transformed as the sadist husband now."

Infinite doubt.
Sadism:

Ego:
Unbearable amount.
Why are you shouting?
Do you think I am deaf?
I have not thought so.
- Why are you shouting then?
Tell me.
Cool brother-in-law..
How dare you touch me?
Am I your brother-in-law  [Informal] ?
I am your brother-in-law  [Formal] .
"If you can touch me, I will kick you off.."
Who are you all?
Have you come for donations?
"No sir, we came on an important work with you,"
What is that?
Look at this once.
What is this dark angle?
From how long is this going on?
Tell me how long is this happening?
"Do not hit brother-in-law, sister is like fire."
How does she look?
"Terrible, Mom."
She's really upset.
- She's called it off.
"- I don""t understand."
What did she expect?
"Well, you done now?"
Are you about finished?
"""Cause, you know, I never bought this whole cynic thing right from the start."
"None of this whole ""Marriage is a sham, you""re better off alone"" thing."
"I don""t buy it."
Never did.
Not for one minute.
"But I""ll tell you who does."
Your daughter.
"The whole world knows you""ve been cheated on... by just about everybody you ever believed in."
I get it.
We all get it.
You can stop sleeping with one eye open right now... because I am not going anywhere.
"L""m right here."
I know.
"Sweetheart, I""m right here."
That dress has been hanging in my closet for 20 years.
"Every couple of years when I clean my closet out, I think:"
"""What the hell am I saving this thing for?"""
What should I do?
"I don""t know what you want me to do."
"- I don""t know what to do!"
- Cassie.
"Honey, listen to me."
"You can pack up your heart, and go home, and be your mama""s daughter... or you can close your eyes and just jump right in."
Just jump in.
- [bleats]
"Well, I think you're wrong."
"Don't worry about nothing, sir."
I'm a very safe driver.
- Want me to tell you how safe?
- [Alfred bleating]
I'll tell you anyway.
I've been driving a hack for 19 years and 11 months.
"And in all that time, I never even put one scratch on a cab."
"In fact, next month,"
They're gonna give me a gold safety award.
- What do you think of that?
- [bleating]
"Boy, you don't like nothing."
- I sure hope you're a good tipper.
- [bleats]
I knew there was something about you that didn't look right.
[tires screeching]
[cabbie] hey!
Hey!
You owe me a fare!
[cabbie sighs]
"- Officer, that goat's a guy."
- The goat?
The guy became a goat when I'm driving.
The guy?
This magician beat me out of this fare.
The magician?
- My perfect record.
- Record?
Oh...
Record.
We treat her in all possible ways.
But she'd better be taken to a hospital.
-Where is she?
- Overthere.
-Was it what you wanted to tell me?
-Yes.
Let's go.
"Oh, Lord."
Why are you keeping her here?
At this time everyone is hiding theiryoung maidens.
She has to be taken to the hospital.
"OK, I'll send Mikhail over."
Do you recognize this buffoon?
"Yes, it is the guywho used to dance around with an officer's cap on."
Do not shoot.
Let's playwith him.
Wait!
The onlything l do not need now is a bullet in my back.
What a bastard.
Can you imagine that I was shot at bythis sniper again.
He has made a hole in my vodka canister.
Not much of a marksman.
-But the remains ofthis vodka seem to be inside you.
- l hate losing such good things to the wind.
Do not breathe myway.
Wow!
"Well, some people are charmed against bullets and some -for luck."
Right?
"-Do not worry, Olya."
-What are you talking about?
It is a question oftime.
"We'll kill him, be it me or not."
I hope I won't.
You never know.
"Hey, girl!"
"You're not from around here, are you?"
Let me see...
You're...
"twenty, maybe twenty five."
Your hair is black.
But your soul is deeply bothered.
Here it comes.
"Yes, my child."
I'm blind.
Blind as a bat.
Then how you know I'm a woman and how old I am?
I've been sitting here for the past 40 years.
The only thing I do here is listen to the sounds.
"Ma'am, if you don't mind."
I...
"I'm sorry, but it is necessary."
[Greta barking]
"We do a routine investigation on any accidental death,"
"Particularly one like your brother's, where"
There weren't any witnesses.
I don't know what to say.
The police told me it was an accident.
"Yeah, I read the report she gave to our detective"
The next day about how you brother parked on the hill
On account of the dead battery.
"Well, I've been thinking about the past four days"
As how I should have gone out and helped him.
I should've insisted.
But I don't understand how the car got down the hill.
- Shut up!
"- Right, shut up."
"I said if you don't pay me back, I'll cut off your thingy, right?"
I remember.
Mommy!
Morons.
"Put on your panty, honey!"
"Stop, you bastard!"
You're dead if I catch you!
This way!
Dumb bastards.
Hurry up and follow me!
"Bastards, I wish I had the money to pay you back."
I couldn't record anything this month.
This absolutely sucks.
What is it?
Why is here so dark?
# Sometimes I have this dream
# About someone holding me tightly
# A dream about a kiss
# But when I wake up I'm always alone
# Then I can't fall sleep again # because of loneliness
# After tumbling the whole night # I see the morning
"# Ah, how wonderful it would be"
# If it wasn't a dream
"# Instead, I wish"
# I could never wake up from my dream
# I miss a man's arms
# I miss a male's scent
Doctor?
Treating a sick heart is my specialty.
"Whenever I see a sick person, I can't just let it pass."
Kat's accident...
Casey.
"Why did you become a priest, father?"
Was... was there...?
Your grandmother.
That's right.
El Papa Mexicano.
I love that story.
"Yes, um a story."
My parents split up when I was... quite young.
"My father, never saw much of him."
So I lived with my mom.
"My friends were mostly... well, her friends, adults."
"Always moving, always changing schools."
It was when we lived in D.C. that... they called it a nervous breakdown.
Except it wasn't a breakdown.
You know how sometimes kids have an imaginary friend?
I had one.
"To me, he looked like a... little red bird."
He could do just about anything.
Correction.
He could make me do... just about anything.
At first he made me feel special.
Then...
I can't remember most of it.
Thankfully.
"Post-traumatic amnesia, it's called."
"Afterwards, I just wanted to move on with my life, put it behind me."
"But my mother, she was always finding new ways to use my story to make a buck."
"""This is the path God gave us, sweetie, use it."""
But I...
I ran away from all that.
We were playing pinochle.
It's a rough game.
"Pardon me, sir."
"Since you want us to speak up, there was a man removed from this barracks last night."
A Lieutenant Dunbar.
We'd appreciate your looking into it.
That's if they haven't shot him yet.
Why was the man arrested?
Sabotage.
He blew up a train.
"They'd have to prove that, wouldn't they?"
Isn't that what the Geneva Convention says?
You can't just take a man and shoot him.
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Of course you did.
Twenty-six carloads of munitions gone off like a trick cigar.
The S.S. is running around in circles.
The Gestapo is arresting the wrong people.
And von Scherbach has caught the fish.
"Most amusing, isn't it?"
Uh-uh.
You are being rude again.
I just wanna go to sleep.
Nine-thirty.
General von Pfeffinger will be at his desk by now.
Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
"Hauptkommando Berlin, General von Pfeffinger."
Dringend.
These were captured by our spy satellite cameras.
It's a public base on the Pacific Coast.
We'll see if we can talk to the fighter jet pilots and get a report from them.
Department Head?
"The wind is so strong, why did you open the window?"
- Because it was a bit stuffy.
- I understand.
Then I will leave first.
"""Twenty people were betrayed by their own country."
"I will definitely come to take it."""
My child!
"No, no, no, no!"
My child!
My child!
No...
My child...
"No, don't."
My child...
Mu Yeol is dead.
I will take the child and support him.
"Only without this child, can you find your own happiness."
Start all over again.
You must be happy.
"Silence that child, if you want to live!"
"Mu Yeol, I took the child and I'll give him his name."
Not as Park Yun Seong but as Lee Yun Seong.
I will go on.
"This is the world's cruelest revenge, because that's the reason I survived."

"Boss, this man stole our drugs to sell."
How do we deal with it?
And who are you?
"Please say, ""sister."""
I'm Noah's girlfriend.
"Boy, it is so nice to see there are still good guys in the world."
"Hey, well, you found us."
Wow.
Lana.
Yeah.
Damn.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
"I hope not, man."
"If you're thinking what I'm thinking, you are a horrible person."
Yeah.
"I mean, there's no universe in which you can go after a man's girlfriend when he's lying motionless in a hospital bed."
Yeah.
Let alone pulling out his IV bag and banging her over his lifeless body.
Wow.
That was on the tip of your tongue.
Hmm?
"Dr. Maxwell, can you come in here for a moment?"
I need to talk to you about something very important.
This is slightly uncomfortable for me to talk about.
Is it about the surgery this morning?
I swear that kid's nose just looked like that.
I want to friend Riley on the Facebook.
"It's just ""Facebook."""
"Oh, I know, but Riley seems to take it pretty seriously."
Would you be willing to friend me and possibly connect me with your friends?
"But, you know, the cool ones."
Okay.
I guess I could do that.
Great!
Let me see it.
That's a nice one.
Yeah.
That takes me back.
"Believe it or not, I used to have Marcus's job."
I wasn't a bad enforcer.
I had my own style.
"You know, I used warm-up bats."
"They gave me a little extra ""pop."""
Yeah.
(CHUCKLES)
There was this one time- God Almighty-
"I was supposed to ""kneecap"" a guy."
Standard boilerplate stuff.
"I'd done it a hundred times, right?"
"Only this time, I take a swing, I hit him-Bam!"
And the bat breaks.
It sends a sliver of wood right into the guy's junk.
Oh!
(CHUCKLES)
You should have heard him.
He was screaming like a cat.
"I swear to God, as I heard the paramedics take him away-"
They said that one of his testicles had swollen to the size of a grapefruit.
You imagine that?
That pain?
(SCOFFS)
(SIGHS) Messy.
"Messy, unfortunate work."
"In my position, there's only one thing worse than a guy who can't make good on bets."
And that's a guy who never loses bets.
(CLOCK TICKING)
Uncommonly pretty eyes.
Oh!
Ow.
Ooh.
- Are you all right?
Ow.
Ow.

"Nail-biting stuff, this is, isn't it?"
Ladies... it is with some surprise...
I announce the vote to be... a tie.
"This means that, as president, I have the casting -"
So sorry I'm late!
"Uh bit of an accident on my bike, Mrs..."
Madam President.
"You haven't voted yet, have you?"
"- Indeed we have, Claire."
"The vote was a tie, which means that I have the casting vote."
"With all due respect, Madam President -"
And I cast my vote in favour of closing the Institute for the duration of the hostilities.
But...
But I'm here now.
And it's lovely to see you.
"But, alas, I'm afraid too late for you to vote."
"I respect what you said about loyalty this morning, Mrs Cameron Madam President."
"Think very carefully about what you're about to say, young lady."
"Feel free to speak your mind, Miss Hillman."
You're among friends here.
I'm not ashamed to say the thought of war scares me.
"It terrifies me, if I'm honest."
But that's why I need this.
You.
He was a witness at the Chandler inquest.
"Maybe he wouldn't help, but you gotta start somewhere."
And he'd be fine.
"Mr. Louis Ord would be fine, just dandy."
"I felt like a fight, Father."
I felt like a fight.
"How many, sir?"
"You alone, f riend?"
I have a small table.
"The bar is good enough, thanks."
It looked like feeding time at the zoo.
All you needed was money to start with and bicarbonate of soda to finish.
- What'll it be?
- Rye and water.
- Plain water?
- Yeah.
"Here you are, sir."
"- Come here, sweetheart."
"- Yes, sir?"
Didn't you used to be a waiter here?
"Louis Ord, 45, single?"
"I seem to know your f ace, but the name--"
Remember a guy named Johnny?
"In this business you meet lots of Johnnies, sir."
You were a witness against this one.
He acted like a mine had gone off under his feet.
I hadn't seen a guy look that scared since jump training.
- Who are you?
- The name is Murdock.
- Capt. Murdock?
- How'd you know?
"- Johnny's told me about you, captain."
"pay me. """
"pay me. """
Paulie could do anything.
Like run up bills on the joint's credit.
And why not?
Nobody will pay for it anyway.
Take deliveries at the front door and sell it out the back at a discount.
Take a $200 case of booze and sell it for $100.
It doesn't matter.
It's all profit.

She's from the Five Towns.
Who?
The Jew broad.
Diane.
I been trying to bang her for a month.
She won't go out with me alone.
what?
what?
Who asked you anything?
Wait to hear what I'm going to say.
what?
She won't go out with Italians alone.
She's prejudiced against Italians.
You fucking believe that?
In this day and age?
What is this world coming to?
prejudiced against Italians.
She won't go out without her girlfriend.
- A roaring fire.
"- Bread, cheese."
- Dripping.
"- Add a little love, makes a meal fit for a king."
I think they're happier being poor.
"Yes, or perhaps not."
"Oh, well, who gives a toss anyway?"
Let's check what's in the larder.
Any food?
"Erm, only a couple of dirty mags."
Huh?
"Oh, yeah."
I'm sure there's a reason why we shouldn't be doing this but I can't put my finger on it.
Don't overtax your tiny mind.
It's concentrating on breathing.
"Shut up, the cheque's in the post."
"Yeah, whose show is this anyway?"
"I'm the famous one, love."
"Come, let us go to the supermarket."
Right.
What a rotten shop.
There's never anything you want to buy.
For example...
"""Cruizos."
Bite-sized cruise-missile shaped lumps of potato flavoured snack.
"""Warning-will give you cancer. """
Everything gives you cancer these days.
You can't blow off without being told it's carcinogenic.
"- In my case, it probably is."
- Probably.
"- Careful, you'll get grabbed by the dick."
- Oo-er.
Yes.
And I am to renounce all claims on the contents of the tomb?
Yes.
"Duplicate pieces that the Cairo Museum feel they can spare will, of course, be ceded to you."
"At the discretion of Monsieur Lacau, I suppose."
I will do everything in my power to make sure that you receive a fair selection.
My husband would have wanted you to return to your work.
Will Mr Mace be returning to Egypt?
"I'm sorry, I thought you knew."
Mace died recently.
"Oh, dear."
I'm so sorry.
I expect the newspapers will say he is another victim of the curse of Tutankhamun.
Arthur always laughed at the idea.
There are times when I wonder.

(Speaking Arabic)
Lift.
Stop.
Stop!
"You, stop."
"You, stop."
"You, lift."
"You, start."
Everyone.
That's good.
Very nice.
Good.
"Okay, let's get the planks in."
Planks in.
Good.
And lower.

I'll slap everyone in this Goddamn school if I have to!
You are never going to play shooty hoops!
Do you understand?

You are gonna sing and dance and be the best at it!
You're hurting my arm!
"Ah, shit."
"Oh, that's good, that's good."
"Yeah, shoot that guy in the face, Kyle."
"Yeah, nice."
You guys...this High School Musical thing isn't gonna go away.
I think we better just get on-board with it.
What?
!
Are you crazy?
"No way, dude."
We promised each other we would never do that.
- Remember?
- Yeah!
"I know, but I think we're really starting to become outcasts at school."
We're losing all our credibility.
"I mean, look at who you guys are hanging out with now."
"Scott Malkinson, for Christ's sake!"
What so bad about hanging out with me?
"Shut up, Scott Malkinson."
I'm Scott Malkinson.
I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes.
"Hey, don't make fun of my diabetes."
Don't make fun of my diabetes.
I'm Scott Malkinson.
You're under arrest!
These guys are clearly well trained...
Welcome!
Huh...?
!
Welcome...
May I take your order?
"Actually, I think this is all you need!"
See ya!
W-What do you want...?
You lose!
Yikes!
Over there!
I can't read this stuff!
Come and get me!
Shall we get down to serious business?
Won't you tell me what you did with the girls you kidnapped?
We should be arriving in Hunan Province about...
"So, we got no reply from the Foundation before departure."
But they've agreed to a conference.
"Doesn't that mean they are interested in the proposal from you, Commander?"
They'd better be.
Huh?
Aren't villians dressed like that supposed to be easily defeated?
Thanks!
You saved my life.
Why were you being chased by them?
"Well, I was just using them to pass the time."
But... is it really okay for me to come in here?
This ship's fine.
Here.
Go on in.
wayne!
this is mine?
i own this?
- all yours.
"- i have never gotten anything this nice in my entire life, wayne."
- so then... you like it?
'cause the guy i got it from said it's in great condition.
"- matsui, your favorite co-  please stop talking."
i just need a minute.
ahh.
"oh, yeah."
this is my helmet?
- that's your helmet.
"put it on, baby."
it matches the bike.
you look so good.
- thank you.
[chuckles] [sighs] how'd you afford this?
- don't worry about it.
it's a gift.
- is it from your college fund?
"- i was born in a trailer park, i was raised in a trailer park, i'm assistant manager of the dollar king, and my woman is cindy wegman."
- what?
"- that's who i am, baby."
- as long as you're sure.
"- well... you see, baby... meeting you brought so much joy in my life and -- [engine turns over, revs] [shouting] and i don't want that joy to end, so i was thinking, maybe you'd do me the honor of..."
[engine revving]
- whoo!
[laughs] [engine shuts off]
- you got to be kidding me.
- want to go for a ride?
- what?
That's a lot of cash for a corporal that barely clears 30 thou a year.
You think it's dirty?
"It's gotta be, right?"
"I mean, why else would Jared hide this much cash in his garage?"
"Plus, where'd he get it?"
Maybe he stole it from a bank.
This looks like a dye pack went off.
"Hmm, apparently our marine isn't as squeaky-clean as he seems."
"Well, only way to find out is to figure out where the cash came from."
FBI specializes in bank robberies.
"Maybe I'll send Gregorio the serial numbers, see if she can trace 'em."
Gregorio?
Aren't we supposed to leave her alone?
It's just a quick check.
It won't take her a minute.
"Yeah, uh-huh."
(imitating):
Uh-huh.

"Lasalle, you know these people?"
"Melody, what are you doing here?"
"I'm sorry, Chris, I told him not to come, but..."
Who are you?

Hey!

That's who I am!
Stay the hell away from my son!
(struggling)
Bend your arms now!
Son of a bitch!
"Melody, talk to me."
Sometimes it's hilarious.
Like every time we hear that Drake gets in a fight.
"You're like, ""Dude, you're not a fighter."
"You're a stalker, that's what the hell you are."""
Listen to his lyrics.
Listen to his lyrics and tell me the man not a stalker.
He be... ¶ I can't get over you.
¶ You left your mark on me
"I'm like, ""What, you got 'em in the basement or something?"""
"He's just driving around in a random white van just picking up innocent women just,"
"""Oh, yeah, she looks good."""
"""Yeah."
"""Motherfucker!"
"""Yeah."
"""Get in the car, get in the car, bitch!"
"Get in the car!"""
"¶ Just hold on, we going home ¶"
I like Drake though.
"He's just so soft though, man."
"That's my dude, man, but it's just,"
"""Oh."
Motherfucker.
"""Worse, worse."""
"""Oh."
"Yeah."""
"""What I just said was so deep."
"It was just, 'Oh."
"Oh.'"""
Sounds like someone hit him in the neck with a dart.
"""Oh."
"""Oh, yeah, they hit me, bitch."
"Ambulance, come here, come here, come here."""
Right.
"I've seen how crazy it can get at those tables, and sometimes, people lose control."
They give in to their emotions.
You will not.
You understand?
Yeah.
Get some rest.
- Some rest?
"- Yeah, we're leaving tomorrow."
Tomorrow?
I have a Quantitative Literacy paper due Tuesday.
"- No, you don't."
- I don't?
"No, I spoke to Professor O'Reilly."
"I told him you were helping me with a special assignment, and he understood, so he gave you an A."
"You see, Ben, amazing things can happen from the inside."
You'll get a call about details later.
"So did the girls go on ahead, huh?"
"Oh, yeah."
"They got a lot more bags to check, you know?"
Okay.
"Well, wait for us by security 'cause Ben and I are gonna hit the head."
"No, I'm good."
"No, I really think you should go."
It's a long flight.
"- No, I'm okay."
- We're going to the bathroom.
"Honestly, I really don't have to go."
- I don't care what you have to do.
"- Look, I really don't have to..."
Please just shut up.
Why are you looking over there?
Whoo.
What a dumbass!
"Well, probably not your finest hour, Stacey, but..."
"No, him."
I didn't want to.
Luke dared me.
"Your boyfriend dared you, so it's his fault?"
What was I supposed to do?
"Stacey, just because he asked you, doesn't mean you had to do it, you're the one who's responsible for you, and..."
We're in a relationship and you are not my guidance counselor.
OK.
Where's Luke right now?
At his mom's.
He thought I was funny.
"Well, Stacey, you now have aspiration pneumonia."
How funny is that?
Not.
You may have also done lasting damage to your respiratory system.
"- Wait, for reals?"
"- Yeah, for reals."
Stacey...
Luke sounds like a bad boyfriend.
I love him so much.
I just wanted to make him happy.
"Hmm, it's interesting."
"That's it, that's all you got?"
- The eggs are brown.
If you...
- They're supposed to be brown!
- Not really.
- It's a country omelette!
What would it take for you to reconsider your decision?
I noticed a couple of parking tickets on his car.
"I guess he's got a couple parking tickets on his car, so maybe we should check on him."
And I also invited Big Joe to stop by the party.
"Okay, but I hope he doesn't wear that tacky rent-a-cop uniform."
I thought we were just inviting close friends.
"Yeah, uh, well, Big Joe's really cool."
And he's helping me with the chairs.
He's standing here right now.
Don't worry.
I own other outfits.
I'm sorry.
I'm just gonna...
go check on Mr. Bezzerides.
Okay then.
"Hey, Mr. Bezzerides, are you home?"
"Everyone's kinda worried about you, so I'm going to go ahead and come inside, okay?"
Mr. Bezzerides?
(GROWLING) (LOUD CLANKING)
It was a sure thing.
"No, it obviously wasn't a sure thing."
"He lost, Jasper."
"No, he was a sure thing up until the moment he lost."
That makes zero sense.
(DOOR OPENS)
What the fuck?
These are shots of our living room.
"(CHUCKLES) Mr. ""Bitch-arabies"" is a peeping tom."
"Yeah, I though that, too, but why take photos of our empty living room?"
Looks like he saved the best ones for his private collection.
What is this thing?
I-I think it's a camera.
See?
How are you?
How did school go?
"You OK, Grandma?"
"Yes, I'm fine."
"""Oh yes, I know it's cold"
"""That the sky is all... askew"
"""I know that neither..."""
"- ""Primroses."" - ""Primroses"
"""Nor lambs are here yet"
"""The earth spins;"
"spring will come back..."""
"- ""on its green horse."" - ""On its green horse"
"""What's a wood without woodpeckers, A garden without lilac?"
"""Everything passes, even..."""
"- ""Even winter."" - ""Even winter."""
- Grandma.
"- Yes, darling?"
I'm coming to live with you.
Isn't it a good idea?
I don't know.
"Yes, a very good idea."
But it's not possible.
You have a mum and dad who'd be sad if you left them.
"Sorry, Mum, there was an accident just as I was leaving."
Weekend emergencies.
And the boss came 2 hours late.
"I sent loads of messages, you didn't answer."
I lost my phone.
And the landline...
- Have you eaten?
- I can't stay.
I have appointments very early.
I see.
I tell you what.
Let's you and I discuss what I have to tell you first.
And then we can both interrogate Ward Fowler.
"You see, as Lieutenant Lucerne,"
I have a rather unpleasant idea taking shape in my mind.
Brandy?
"Thank you, sir."
"What might that be, sir?"
"Well, that might be..."
"And I'm speaking strictly as Lucerne, of course."
Of course.
"It just might be, unlikely as it may seem, it just might conceivably be"
Ward Fowler is the man we're after.
You mean the murderer?
Exactly.
No.
Yes.
I know this comes as a shock to you.
But let's think about it.
Let's examine the possibilities.
"Well, if you say so, sir, but I don't see where there could be possibly a motive."
Why would Ward Fowler wanna kill Claire Daley?
It's Claire Daley who made him famous.
That's what I was wondering and then
I got to thinking about the IOUs.
"Oh, did you, sir?"
Yes.
Oddly enough I did.
"I'm speaking as Lucerne, of course."
"Yes, of course."
Half a million dollars in IOUs.
"Daddy gave you two songs, and this song now too."
She knows the play by heart.
- She can stand in for me.
"Alex, where the hell are you?"
Sorry!
He is always late!
It's unprofessional!
I'm leaving!
Alex!
"Sherlock, my friend, where are we going and what happened?"
We are going to solve the murder case at the castle
They're singing too slow.
"Where, when and who murdered Colonel McHarry?"
"Daddy, they're singing too slow."
"Daddy, they're singing too slow."
"- Goni, not now!"
"Alex, you should've done a full turn by now."
"But you're late, no wonder he is all mixed up."
I don't understand what's going on.
Are you asleep?
Can I give you a hug?
You know that I'm stressed.
The play is opening in 3 days and so many things aren't ready.
That's no excuse.
You're right.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I didn't mean to bother you.
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
"So are we friends again, Gonki Galonki?"
Did Gonki Galonki enjoyed the rehearsal?
"Yes, yes, yes?"
"No, no, no?"
"Yeah, my way was hard to find"
Can't sell your soul for peace of mind
I hate these plates.
"Oh, look, honey."
We got a food processor.
"Rest your head on me, my dear"
A blender.
"Took a world of trouble,"
Took a world of tears
Took a long time to get back here
"Hey, it's me."
"I, uh..."
I thought we should talk.
"Well... actually, I..."
I don't know.
Always had more dogs than bones
I could never wear those clothes
It's a dark victory
Told us you were satisfied
But it never came across
"Square one, my slate is clear"
"Rest your head on me, my dear"
It took a world of trouble
It took a world of tears
It took a long time...
I brought my computer.
I thought I'd get some work done while she's napping.
"Oh, she's a big napper."
"You'll have plenty of time, but you have to get her down by 2:00 or else..."
Or else what?
She turns into a monster?
Kinda.
"Hi, Norman."
"Oh, hi, Allison."
What's the matter?
Same old thing.
Grownups who act like children.
"Hey, could I walk home with you?"
No.
You'd get home late.
"You mean, your mother wouldn't like it."
- Well... .
"- Come on, Norman."
Come on.
Spend the afternoon in the library again?
Yeah.
Isn't it awfully dull going there every day?
Yeah.
Then why do you do it?
I like books.
Good place to do my homework.
"Besides, where else could I go but home?"
Go down to the water.
Sit in the square.
Take a walk in the woods.
I can't.
"You know, that was a nice speech you wrote for Mrs. Thornton."
I'm sorry I did it now.
Why didn't you read it yourself instead of Rodney Harrington?
Because I was afraid I'd cry.
Still might cry every time I think of Ms. Thornton not getting that job.
"You know, you just might turn out to be a great writer."
"Norman, I hope so."
"You know, every time I touch a book or read a story or even when I just open the dictionary something inside of me goes thump and my heart starts pounding, and my stomach."
"Hold on, Mr. About-face."
"Is this the same woman you described as a chippy, a leech and a vampire?"
"All lies to save face, sir."
You don't get over a goddess.
- What else does the little Aphrodite have to say?
- Let me see.
"""Thank goodness for Gus."
"He helped me realize the error of my ways."""
Oh!
Good old Gus.
I knew I could count on him.
- Who is this Gus cuss?
- Gus Nagy... my best friend.
"A while back, he wrote me Laverne and Morty were having fights."
"So, I told him to do his best to keep the fur flying'."
- Ah.
- [Laughing]
"""And so, dear Max..."
"""I wanted to let you know before you hear it from anybody else."
"I am marrying Gus Nagy."""
I can't believe it.
I just lost my best girl and my best friend in one lousy sentence.
"Now, pull yourself together, son."
You'll bounce back.
When you get home to Toledo... you'll find a new girl and a new friend.
Toledo.
I'll be the laughingstock there.
It's like Nero Wolfe said...
"""You can't go home again."""
- [Helicopter Approaching]
- I had one shot at true happiness... and now it's killed me.
"I tell you what, Max."
And?
"Anselmo said, ""No subway stop no BankExchange."""
- And you said?
I thought we could keep Anselmo on the back burner but we need BankExchange.
We need jobs.
We need that money going into the community.
Given the situation at Broadway and Marcy it's politically expedient.
The hell with politically expedient.
"I'm talking about a 60-story building that will employ 3,000 people."
It'll put food on the table.
That's what counts.
That's what we're about.
That's BankExchange.
That's all it is.
You said we can't afford a subway stop.
That'll take politics.
More than one way to skin a cat.
Get in there.
Keep that staff fired up.
You're the boss.
What are you doing tonight?
Hadn't thought about it.
You ever see Carousel?
The musical?
You serious?
A little before my time.
You'll love it.
Frank Anselmo will be there.
I'm free.
George Frank Anselmo's in there.
Tell him to come up.
I want to see him in the lobby.
You got anything?
Who knew so many people travelled through Colombia?
Wait.
Who was that?
Back it up.
"That is Alberto Velez, 52 years old, born in Santo Domingo."
Who is that?
"Abby, get rid of his beard."
Lighten his hair.
Clean him up.
I get it.
I totally know where you're headed.
Cross-reference him with the terminal crowd.
Got him.
"I'm gonna have to ask you folks to clear this area here, please."
Thank you.
Excuse me.
"Lana, is it?"
I'm afraid you can't let anyone off that plane.
They've been circling for hours.
I only take orders from TSA.
"Tell her, Ellie."
What's this all about?
Have you found a gun yet?
"No, but we're not done screening."
"Well, unless you want an assassination on your hands, you're gonna move that plane to another gate."
"This is the only gate that's cleared, and the plane's already de-boarding."
"Oh, no."
"Oh, yes."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are now pleased to announce the arrival of flight 3182 from London, now deplaning at gate 212."
"Esto es para ti, Gomez!"
Esto es para ti!
"Daddy, we've found it."
"God, hope you would bless Yu-fa and Nim-sai, make them live happily in heaven, thank God!"
"Sir, beware of catching cold, let us handle it."
"Chung, open the coffin and check the body."
How is the body?
We still can see his face.
Turn the body upside down and remove his trousers.
What did you see?
His ass.
Anything on his ass?
A triangular stain.
It's birthmark.
"Right, he is your brother Nim-sai."
"Actually, Nim-sai was sold to Canton by you for over 20 years."
"If he is still alive, can you recognise him?"
"You know, when one is happy, his has one look."
"And when he is sad, he has another look."
I can't guarantee the change of his look.
Do you remember anything special about Nim-sai?
He has had a very beautiful jade round his neck.
"There is a little door on it, behind the door, the name ""Sai"" of Sir Ho Sai is carved on it."
"Master, what are you doing?"
Wait.
"Master, what are you doing here?"
Wait.
Master.
You are lucky!
What's the matter?
Are you willing to kiss Lotus?
"Master, are you kidding me?"
Will I be that lucky?
It's true!
"Oh, just leave it!"
You're going to wake him up...
So what?
God bless you!
Help me!
"Mom, why return so soon?"
Look at you!
"Such strength, what's yourshoe size now?"
Yourson...
Yourson.
Yourbabies will be someone else's but his will be ours.
Where were you?
If I'd known I would have picked you up...
I called many times.
You didn't answer.
"Oh dear, sorry."
Love is in the air.
"If you screw up love, it starts to stink."
Your husband's fingerprints?
Back again for a fidelity reading.
"This strong man, your lover, in his thirties, with wide shoulders..."
"Look sugar-puff; dunno about the wide shoulders with a guy at 58, I only care about his wallet."
Then he definitely has a son...
"Yes, he is cheating on you."
With a woman ora man?
"Listen baby-cakes, if you don't know this shit, shut up!"
"There is no strong, young guy."
"That old fart dumped me, okey?"
Which one?
But there's a young guy...
Enough!
"If you figure it out, just fax me orsomething."
"Now, that, brah, is what I call a good-looking wahine."
She sure was.
"What do you mean, """"was""?"
Is she dead or something?
Or something.
[ Man ] I don't think you understand.
I'm John Sculley of the Newport Sculleys.
"[ Rick ] Mr. Sculley, I'm sure in Newport, you make the tide go in and out, but here at the King Kamehameha Club, you have to be a member, which you're not,"
"or the guest of a member, which you aren't, in order to use the facilities."
"And anyway, sir, it's after 6:00."
It requires a jacket here.
What about him?
"Hey, didn't I tell you to make all the deliveries in the rear?"
Right.
I think I understand.
How much is it to join your little club for an afternoon?
Don't even try it.
"I was gonna buy you one drink, as a courtesy, at the club."
"Now I want you out right now, or I'm gonna throw you out."
You and who else?
Me.
- Get me a drink.
- Coming right up.
Thanks.
That's all right.
I just didn't wanna see you kill anyone.
"Besides, I need your help."
I gotta find her.
She used to work Hotel Street.
What club?
Wiki-Wiki.
Wiki-Wiki?
Woman's pump at 10:00.
"Oh, so how does it feel being the, uh... little guy?"
What's that?
Earthquake?
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Blech!
"And now, for the moment of truth."
It fits!
The shakes worked.
"Hi, there."
I thought you might like to try our new flavors.
"Gaunt grape and lean, mean nectarine."
"Thanks, but I lost all the weight I had to."
I don't need any more shakes.
You really think so?
You guys must work on commission.
"As you can plainly see,"
I... (gasps) look awful.
I'll take two cases.
"Quick, before the firemen have to come and cut me out of my bedroom."
"Hey, by the way, how did your meeting go with the president of Everything Emporium?"
Not bad.
"At first, it wasn't going well, but then he had, uh..."
metamorphoses.
"Either you're up to something, or..."
"No, that's it."
You're up to something.
"Mmm, Sabrina, you've got to try these croissants."
They're just like Grandma used to make.
"Well, not my grandma, but someone's grandma who knew how to bake."
"- It seems to say ignore these guys, I'm with you."
"Well, it's not Nick and His Friends' Infinite Playlist."
- Right.
"- Oh, that's sweet."
I say we do a drive-by.
No.
Absolutely...
I was loopy there.
I think it was pretty late.
Pretty early.
You can normally tell by our eyes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You didn't CGI out any of the red in some places.
I'm sure it was...
Or maybe you did.
No.
I took some of the red out of your cheeks in the exteriors because you looked cold.
"- Oh, my gosh."
"- Hey, did you have to take out some of our icy cold breath coming out of our mouths?"
- No.
We just didn't use...
- No?
Look at that face.
"Look, they were falling in love."
"You see a bit of breath in this movie, don't you?"
"- Well, this is worth talking about."
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Kevin Corrigan.
"Ari, tell us about your evening this night."
"This was, like, 3:00 in the morning and we were supposed to shoot a whole other scene."
-Hallo!
-Hallo!
-Hallo!
He's not here.
I hope nothing will happen to him.
-It doesn't look safe here.
"-Well, it's quiet instead."
"If I'm not wrong, it's such a sharp, frosty silence."
I would say even a dry silence.
Personally I'm more suited to the silence on Jupiter.
The silence there was so fizzy.
"-I'm not wrong, am I?"
-Yeah.
"On Jupiter it was fizzy, but sometimes deep and sublime."
"While on Ganimed the silence was kind of dark blue, lazy, blending together."
-Am I right?
Do you remember?
-Of course.
Only I don't remember what the silence blended together with.
With a morning cock-crow.
But on Oberon the silence there was something wicked.
-The nicest silence is on our planet.
-That's right.
Such a silence I haven't heard anywhere else yet.
The evenings in front of the bunker...
It's such a silence.
"Hallo, Doctor!"
Quiet!
You are in a reserved area.
"I am a crystal clear well, please drink."
"I am a crystal clear well, please drink."
"I am a crystal clear well, please drink."
"I am a bear, not a cow."
"You hairy daisies, you think yourhairwill save you."
At least we look like real men.
Ever heard about Scottish drags?
They weartrousers like you.
Save yourbullshit for your cook book!
Being a real man doesn't mean you can't be polite.
Are you fertilizing the fur on yourshoulders?
You're all dying fora real man... and when you find one...
- Get the fuck out of here!
Right now.
"- Look, I was just trying to say..."
"Ah, of course."
Yourhairy ass doesn't get fucked.
What the hell?
Just leave the poor boy alone.
"Come on, it is yourturn."
"Wait here, I'll come back and wax yourshoulders."
What have I done wrong?
!
"Son of a bitch, he screwed up my show."
Why do you pity these people?
This ZENNE is a really great dancer.
AZENNE?
Amale belly dancer?
What's that got to do with yourwork.
I am just interested.
"Perhaps, you want to do art photography."
I could arrange an exhibition.
It should be easy with all your awards.
I don't know.
Stop blaming yourself.
"[J.D.] I knew if I didn't leave that bar and go back,"
"I'd never be able to enjoy any of the simple things, even a woman eating my former bangs."
Voilà.

"See, that's the thing about being an extra mile guy."
You never know who it's gonna rub off on.
"""Sister Blanche, I've got a little birthday remembrance for you."""
"[High pitched Southern accent] ""Oh, have you, Stanley?"
"I wasn't expecting any."""
"- ""I hope you like it."""
- Aw...
"- You're hating this, aren't you?"
"- No, that's not it at all."
I don't believe for a second that you really want me to leave.
"You gotta feel it, Lyle."
Get involved.
What do you people say?
Let's take it from the top?
"""Sister Blanche, I've got a little birthday remembrance for you."""
Again.
Do it with some force.
"Okay, honey, finish up."
We've gotta get to school.
- Mom?
- Yeah.
Does this map look like Portugal?
I have no idea.
But nobody knows what Portugal looks like.
"I mean, even the Portuguese think they live in Spain."
Sorry I'm late.
This is all I could find.
!
I hid it in my office before the police came.
You stole the medallion?
"Oh, purely for safekeeping."
Why?
"I had no choice, MacGyver."
You don't realize what's at stake.
I'd say about 20 years... for robbery.
I can explain everything.
My office is this way.
Come on.
In you come.
It's been torn apart.
"All right, don't touch anything."
I'll call the police.
"Nonsense, this is how it always looks!"
A neat office is the product of an empty mind!
Professor?
"Just a moment, MacGyver."
Hold your horses.
Ah.
"There we are, safe and sound."
Just as I promised.
"Now, what's going on?"
"Ah, yes, well, that requires some explaining."
Yes.
We are here.
You said the riddle on the Ark was a set of instructions?
Exactly.
"And if, uh, Cleeve stole the Ark, it can only mean that he's after the treasure!"
Is there some reason you cou--?
Is there some reason you couldn't have told the police that?
Ok?
"Winter break and then the month of July, and this is the first time she's even ever been around the house."
I don't think she's actually a mom.
She told you about my mom taking pills?
Did she?
I don't know.
You don't know?
You know everything about your mom?
The bulls and clippers are on tonight.
The point spread is perfect for a killing.
You want to put 50 on it?
You want to tell me why you stole my palm pilot?
What are you talking about?
From the office earlier today.
I want it back.
"You know what, screw you!"
"You know, my father's a little embarrassed to tell your mother, but..."
Heh heh...
I'm not.
I didn't take anything.
"All right, man?"
[Engine starts]
I want to set something straight.
Burton:
Ok.
I never told Anne about your flirting with me.
My mother saw us in the pool one afternoon that summer.
"I don't know where Anne was, but..."
"We were wrestling around in the pool, and my mother saw, and she jumped to a conclusion and told my sister."
Ok.
But it was the truth.
"Liz, you were a kid."
Booze?
Take off your hand.
"I get you house, a girl for company, and now you want booze..."
What do you think of me?
You look like my boyhood friend who ran away.
Get on to the bike dude.
"Hey dude, this place is so colorful."
Who are these muscleman?
These are bouncers.
Then what about him?
- I am their boss.
- What?
He looks like a baby lizard!
Let's run away before he spits.
Order please.
A light beer for me.
"Sir, what about you?"
"First, get me two large, one lime cordial and some ice cubes."
Quick.
- Will that fill you enough dude?
- I shall order more later.
"- Sir, side dish?"
"-Get me scrambled egg, salted green peas, 75 gm mixture, a pack of Ravi's pickle"
- Sorry sir.
Ravi's pickle is not available in such a big bar?
I can't believe it!
It's such a shame!
"- Grilled chicken, Tandoori chicken, Chilly chicken"
- OK sir.
-You shall order the rest later right?
"-You are absolutely right, dude."
You greedy monster!
And this flaming janitor comes out the door.
TJ is the janitor of the school.
"And after the building blows up, he's the person"
One that comes out in flames.
So Kimberly's gonna light him.
BRENDAN FLYNT:
"Now, this is a broomstick"
That's lit in flames?
WOMAN:
Just the tip.
It's like a long match.
BRENDAN FLYNT:
"Yeah, a long match."
OK.
"OK, so she ignites him, staggers along here,"
Runs around like a maniac.
Slides down the banister here and we'll
Put him out right down there where that big blood patch is.
INTERVIEWER:
He's playing a janitor.
Who you don't actually see before or after this.
"But you know, hey, we can light a guy on fire,"
"So might as well, right?"
"Now is there flames only on his back,"
"Or his front, or his side?"
His full back.
BRENDAN FLYNT:
"Right, right, OK."
Nothing on the front.
So that's why he's gonna be twisting.
"Yeah, I'll be twisting and getting the flame all the way."
And [shouting]
The Inspector is up with him now.
Father.
What a terrible shock for you both.
Who could have done such a thing?
Edie is quite understandably wondering whether it was me.
I haven't said a word.
"No need to, Edie."
I made the tea and no-one else touched it.
"If I was in your position, I would think it was me too."
"Padre, what a surprise!"
"Good morning, Inspector Mallory."
Last rites and a murder.
"It's Christmas come early for you, isn't it?"
"Right, George, with apologies,"
"I gather you made Henry's tea, so I'll have to take a statement."
You know the drill.
"Yes, of course."
And please search my house.
"You don't need a warrant, I've got nothing to hide."
I don't doubt it.
"Thank you, though."
Goodfellow.
"All yours, Padre."
"Henry, may I?"
I'm here to offer you confession and absolution.
No.
Thank you.
As you wish.
Have you any idea who did this to you?
"May I ask, was that your first cup of tea of the day?"
Yes.
"That woman at your party, Iris Lightman, and the cover-up she was talking about."
Neither does this.
Neither does this.

You're in my office.
Agent Brandt.
You're in my office.
Let me make it easy for you.
"We've got the Carson wedding, the Dankowski party, two funerals, and Jill calls in sick today of all days."
"Sara, I'm sorry, I have to handle this."
There isn't anybody else.
"- Mom, what about..."
"- Glynn, do they want roses in this?"
"Judy took that order, ask her."
"Mom, this is the most important day of my life."
You have to be there.
You promised.
I know.
"Excuse me, are you Sara Johnson?"
You're next.
I'll be there.
I promise.
Before you audition.
Is there anything you'd like to say about your contemporary piece?
"No, it's pretty self-explanatory."
Did you have a good ride?
I slept through most of it.
I guess you've got stuff.
Baggage?
Three suitcases.
One big one.
Sorry I had to split so soon after the funeral.
"If I could have gotten out of that gig, I would have hung around longer."
Guess it was pretty tough leaving all your friends.
Here we are.
Put them anywhere.
I'll give you the grand tour.
"Not like what you're used to, but the water's hot and the mice are friendly."
Bathroom.
Kitchen... big kitchen.
"It's ancient history, man."
"Hey, I still feel bad."
"I mean, I heard where you ended up."
Community college ?
You trying to rub my nose in it ?
"Hey, I'm saying it's my bad."
Yeah ?
"Dude, tell me something I don't know."
My net worth is like ten times his.
I was looking forward to rubbing that in his face at the picnic.
"Don't go far, Mr. Banks."
Right this way.
So what now ?
Check with Dr. Talcott in DNA.
"See if our murder weapon is telling us anything, would you ?"
Yup.
"The reunion murder, right ?"
Yeah.
"Uh, is there any non-victim blood on our champagne bottle ?"
"No, but I did find something else, though."
There's something in the blood.
Any idea what it could be ?
"Whatever it is, it's underneath the blood."
So it was stuck on the bottle before it was used as a weapon.
"Yeah, I gotta get this to Trace."
Thanks.
That from the Bob Keaton murder ?
Dusting powder.
All they got was smudges.
Dusting powder...
"Eric, here's what I want you to do."
"Let's stay focused on this powder, okay ?"
"And one day, who knows?"
"All right, sir."
I'm sure the senator can handle Mr. Webster.
There is one concern we need to...
"Oh, right, concern."
Laine?
K told me about your little sexual romp in college.
Shit.
Tomorrow is the 17th.
- Glenda?
"- Yes, sir?"
Tomorrow is Jacobson's birthday.
Have you got something for the son of a bitch?
"Yes, sir."
You got him a leather-bound Don Quixote.
"Oh, good."
Good gift.
Metaphorical gift.
He'll be trying to figure out why I got him that forever.
"Ah, were you married at the time?"
"Uh, I was a freshman in..."
"You know, sir, I'm just not going to comment on the whole thing."
It's beneath me and it's beneath the press.
That's the way to go.
Fuck the press.
Senator Hanson does not kiss and tell.
- It's perfect.
- Maybe I was too rough on Shelly in Hartford.
"Then this would all be moot, 'cause you wouldn't be president, sir."
You know what?
"Married, unmarried, One guy, two guys, the whole football team."
Who the fuck cares?
I need new hair.
"Hi, Mom."
This is Rebecca.
"It's kind of a new relationship, so don't say anything too embarrassing, OK?"
"Oh, hi, Rebecca."
He wet his bed till he was 12.
Oops.
Wanna sit?
"Hey Weasel, you wanna move your stuff off the table?"
We gotta cram for the math test tomorrow.
"My name's not Weasel, it's Morgan."
I thought you liked it when I called you Weasel.
I've never liked it.
"You like it so much, it's your name now..."
Weasel.
- What an assertive little sister you have.
"- Oh, it's the uniform."
"When she takes it off, she has a vulnerable side, I'm almost certain."
"OK, Morgan, soccer practice."
Remember what we learned last week?
Don't kick the coach.
"Hey, before we get started, why don't we take a break?"
Can I get you something to drink?
I got full access to all the major appliances in the kitchen.
Aren't you gonna show me your house first?
The house?
You wanna see the house?
Sure.
"Uh, this is the house."
Are there any other rooms?
"Uh, yeah, there's probably one right through here."
Do you wanna...?
Okay.
Okay.
Here.
Your fee.
But if you ditch me
I won't want my money back
but something else in return.
Is this even worth it?
"It's 4 am already and you are not sleeping yet, Boss?"
You should have joined us for dinner.
"Because you didn't go, Aey and Chai kept clinking glasses with me."
They sent their regards to you too.
Look.
There are a lot of them.
Gosh they wrote on me like I was a notebook.
"Don't be sad, microdick"
"- Hey, Marcia, how are you doing?"
- All right.
- Can we come in and talk?
- Yeah.
"Hi, puppies!"
'Marcia's been a little bit difficult to speak to.
"'She, I think, is embarrassed a little bit about her family's past."
"'And so, she's hidden a lot of information from us.'"
"So I know growing up, your family didn't have a lot to eat."
- Yeah.
Were there ever times when you didn't have running water and electricity?
- A lot of times.
- A lot of times.
SHE COUGHS
"DOG BARKS So, when growing up, the drugs in the house were weed and cocaine, right?"
Right.
Any physical details that may help to identify him?
There's nothing.
He's completely perfect.
"Freddie, now that you're here, I've been thinking..."
Yes?
"If Roland's parents were looking for him, surely they would have informed the Constabulary."
Maybe so.
Perhaps... they don't care.
You're having second thoughts.
You asked if I wanted to know the truth... perhaps not knowing is the best course.
You wouldn't be the first of my clients to change their mind.
No father could be better than William.
He loves the boy.
He truly is his son.
"And you, Julia?"
I can't bear the thought of not having Roland.
Well then it's settled.
"He couldn't have better parents, you must never question that."
(Julia sighs.)
- I'm gonna take this way!
"- Come on, over here!"
- I've got nothing!
- Help me!
Nothing that way!
Look.
Over there!
It won't get away this time!
"- Everyone, stay close."
- It's over here!
Come on!
Keep up with them!
Go!
There's some pain involved.
"You know, this is the only place around here with bars on its windows."
- I wonder what Doug was so worried about.
"- Come on, baby."
There better be somethin' good in here.
There we go.
Got it.
Looks like he didn't leave much.
"- Well, I've worked with less."
- Check for bills.
Bunch of junk mail.
Magazines.
Hello.
Hey.
Here's a quiz.
Tells you how to pick your mate based on what you eat.
"Okay, Mike."
What's your favorite meat?
"- Pleasure reading later, Sam."
"- Oh, you're no fun."
"Mike, two guys with guns coming fast."
They must have been watching the house.
They got the back covered.
Nothin'.
Just because there are no windows or doors... doesn't mean there are no exits.
The thing to look for is the air-conditioner unit.
That's where the wall is weakest.
"Also, people watch doors."
They don't watch air conditioners.
"Ooh, the damsel in distress."
She said it was an emergency.
What do you want me to do?
You told me I didn't have to go into the family business.
You said I should make my own choices.
"Ah, so you managed to do your own thing, huh?"
"Yeah, uh, for a while, yeah."
And I think I went to college because of you.
"But, you know, people grow up."
Yeah.
Responsibilities and--
"But still, um you took an interest in me when no one else did."
That matters.
So thank you.
"Well, you know, the only thing that really matters is, uh that you're happy."
"Are you happy, Sam?"
[ENGLISH SDH]
"When I told dad I was scared of the thing in my closet, he gave me a .45."
What was he supposed to do?
I was 9 years old.
The weapon training and melting the silver into bullets?
"Man, Dean, we were raised like warriors."
"Lock the doors and windows, close the shades."
And most important
Watch out for Sammy.
I don't understand the blind faith you have in the man.
It's called being a good son.
"Dad's gonna be here, right?"
He'll be here.
Promise.
"- Where is he, anyway?"
- On business.
- And that's why you ran away.
- I was just going to college.
I tested it on myself.
"From what I can tell,"
Larson had no knowledge of the murder.
Keep looking.

What if I'm losing it again?
What happened today?
I got an up-close look into the mind of a man
"I was convinced was a murderer, but all the evidence says otherwise."
Every explanation comes up in his favor.
Maybe he's innocent.
Maybe.
I've always been good at spotting guilt.
Haven't always been good at spotting innocence.
"Hey, hey."
You're not that guy.
"You're home with me, with your daughter."
You're in a good place.
But you don't know what goes on in that room.
You don't know what goes on in here.
"Julian, you can't do this job alone."

- Have to reset it manually.
-Don't follow me.
-Gyung Joon...!
-Leave me alone!
-Gyung Joon...
-Why?
Are you scared that your precious Yoon Jae is going to be seen as a ruthless jerk?
Are you going to cry again?
"Then before I do more, leave me alone and go."
"I'm sure you're upset after hearing those words, so how can I go and leave you alone?"
Don't pretend that you're worried.
You're just like my uncle!
"You're worried that I'll always stay in this precious Yoon Jae's body, right?"
"Just like my uncle, you don't like me and are burdened by me, so why are you pretending to worry?"
Gyung Joon...
"I told you the more things are like this, the more I'll do things my way."
Da Ran!
Yoon Jae...
Did you just shove my sister?
Why are you yelling at my sister?
Choong Sik...
It isn't something for you to get involved in.
Just go.
He was being weird to you this morning at school.
I came to see what was going on...
And it's a good thing that I came.
Yoon Jae...
I really didn't take you to be like this.
But you're weird...
Yoon Jae!
(Mae-Hyung = Brother-in-law)
I'm not your brother-in-law!
If it's your husband...
"And of all the cars to borrow, why mine?"
You just don't like him.
Never gave me a chance.
"This shouldn't be about Danny, it should be about us."
I care about you.
"I'm sorry, A.J."
Hi.
Did you come to take my mother to lunch?
"You screwed with me, son."
"I don't really care about that, but you're keeping your mother from being happy and you ought to be ashamed of yourself."
She is happy.
And I'm happy.
It's not our job to make you happy.
Still driving a rental car?
"I'll be sending you the bill, boy."
I never consented to marriage with Mustafa.
I accepted him only as a friend of my father's.
A friend of the family.
I spent many hours in their home.
Fatimah was always happy to see me.
I was a child.
You brought me presents.
"I thought of you as a favourite uncle, not a suitor."
Fatimah's father came to me with her promise.
- He signed the kitab.
- He signed the kitab.
I did not.
- Her father was her wali.
- Objection.
Fatimah was 18.
Her father was no longer entitled to serve as her wali without her consent.
"Thank you, Miss MacKenzie."
He's my husband.
You said it was over
"Yeah, it was."
Was?
Past tense... wow...
Oh my God!
Who cheats on their lover with their husband?
I have to go to work.
That's all you've got to say?
- Do you want me to lose my job?
"- No, I don't want you to lose your job."
I just want you to tell me the last few months have meant something to you.
"You said it was over between you two, Laura, finished."
You told me you wanted something different.
"Nice ass, Britny."
Britnay!
"""Nice ass, Britnay!"""
Brit!
"Psychopath then, is it?"
"Being bludgeoned to death with hammer, I think we can rule out manslaughter."
"Shame, really."
She's quite hot.
"Yeah, that makes it so much worse!"
"Forensics report, from Ken."
With the DNA results from the plaster found at the scene.
The ones I asked for half an hour ago.
"Erm, we were training, Danny."
That shit is sacrosanct.
"Yeah well, as long as your abs are ripped."
"Don't wish for it, my friend."
Work for it.
"Hello, Birthday boy!"
"You know, when I was younger, I almost got engaged but her brother talked me out of it"
Really?
What did he say?
"He said, ""Brett, you have a beautiful penis"" and..."
Dip.
Woo!
"OK, guys."
Help me out.
What should I do for my wedding?
I don't know where to begin.
"Charlotte, what did you do for your wedding?"
Was it like a fairy tale?
My wedding was exactly like a fairy tale.
"Um, once upon a time there was a princess with low self esteem..."
And terrible taste in men.
She went to Las Vegas and ate some magic beans.
Then she married an evil ogre named Mark.
"Mark put a baby in her, and ruined her credit."
"12 weeks later a wizard named Jeff, the divorce attorney, annulled her mistake."
The end.
OK.
"Um, I'm surprised."
But just so you guys know you're all going to be in my wedding party.
"Except for you, Charlotte."
- I'm sorry.
I just met you.
"- Oh, you know, that's fine."
"I'll just uh, I'll come to the next one."
"Oh, hey Bursk, Les, I'm assuming you guys want to be each other's plus ones because"
"- you know, smooch buddies."
"- No, no, stop."
No cute winks.
Run!
An earthquake!
No!
Look!
The ark has started to move!
What's all this shaking?
That brat is moving the ark!
I've activated Noah's global warming mode.
Ice from the North and South Pole will begin to melt.
And seawater that is warmed will cause abnormal weather conditions and swallow most of the land.
Professor?
You can't turn back now.
This is the beginning of the second flood legend.
So cockroach you're still alive!
I'll destroy it from the inside.
I'll take this ark down with that brat.
Professor!
That's it!
That bastard!
That will be enough!
Silence!
Professor!
So there you are.
I'm taking the Doc and Ms. Margaret back.
other than the door into Noah.
hurry and go!
The plate...
I won't let you go!
I gave the Professor the one chance to co-exist with God.
I'm your only enemy here.
Let's fight our way to the pits of Hell.
haven't you learned your lesson?

"Well, I may be limping down the aisle, but at least I won't be limping in something Swiffer might sell to dust off ceiling fans."
[woman screaming]
"Oh, my God, girl!"
here she comes!
Here she comes.
"My girl, Rhonda, had that dress first."
"Oh, your girl is gonna have to pry it out of my cold, dead hands."
"Hey, Max, Caroline!"
Try it on!
Follow me to the changing room.
"(Caroline) I'm never coming out in this dress, I'm scared."
"(Max) So on the count of one, two..."
Maybe it's not that bad.
(both) It's bad.
Okay.
"So you're telling me,"
"Versace got murdered, but no one's taken out whoever made these?"
I know.
I feel like Tweety Bird is gonna sue us for copyright infringement.
I feel like we should have giant toilet paper rolls under here.
"Well, maybe we'll like these better when we're out of this bright light."
"Max, we are the bright light."
"Ladies, you forgot the matching hats."
But that didn't mean that Claire was finished watching over Ward's career.
She stopped being a lover and she became a mother.
Sent him off to have his teeth capped.
Made him drop ten pounds.
Showed him how to comb his hair.
It sounds like she was proud of him.
It was ego.
Claire's ego.
You learn.

"I just wanted to fill you in, sir."
Right.
What have we got?
Nothing.
"We still think it was premeditated, don't we?"
"Oh, I don't know, sir."
What do you suppose?
"Well, I suppose if that's your instinct, then it must be right."
"My instinct about Claire, and I don't have any clues to go on, is that she was what they call,"
I believe the term is victim-prone.
"Some people are, you know?"
"And Claire, well,"
Claire was given to taunting people.
She was a born victim.
She was the kind who asks for it.
"In her marriage, in her life..."
"Yeah, so now Jeanine is saying that the attack on Abnegation was orchestrated by a group of renegade Divergents and their sympathizers."
So then they're blaming this whole thing on us?
Yeah.
Jeanine needed a reason to petition the Council to institute martial law.
Now she has one.
(CHUCKUNG)
Staying here at Amity is still our best option for now.
We need to keep an ear to the ground.
Find out where the rest of the Dauntless are.
Then we can make a move.
We need to kill Jeanine.
I know.
But we're not ready yet.

"Beatrice, you're not being serious, right?"
"No, I am being serious."
I'm not gonna stop until she's dead.
"Tris, you can't just go around killing people."
"No, she's right."
Listen to your sister.
"Tris, I think you should go to Erudite and kill Jeanine yourself."
"I'll stay with Caleb so that you don't get him killed, too."
What?

"Come on, you know."
Like you did your parents.

What do you think you're doing?
My office.
Now.
"Yes, we'll analyze it."
- So I'll come back next week?
- Excellent.
- My pleasure.
- Good-bye.
- What are you doing here?
- I was just leaving.
Don't freak out.
I just wanted to see you.
But I'm harmless.

"Hi, Lola."
I've just taken an elephant-sized dump.
One and two and three.
Forward and hold.
Can you take over?
Alicia never came back.
"I didn't want to scare her again, so I didn't go to her house until a week later, when I had to see her father."
It rained all week.
The next time I saw her was here.
What happened to her?
A car accident on one of those rainy days.
"Her father didn't want her to be alone for a minute, day or night."
"He asked for the best nurses,"
"I've got a very good reputation here, and they recommended me."
"When he saw me, he remembered that we'd met and he'd a moment of doubt, but he ended up hiring Matilde and me exclusively."
That was four years ago.
And here we are.
"Right, Alicia?"
I started going to the ballet on my days off.
And to the Cinematheque.
I try to see all the silent movies.

What happened?
You never told me.
Nothing.
"I, uh, did the right thing."
Good.
That's... that's good.
Okay.
Well...
I'll see you later.
"Because, Sam, it is time."
Time for what?
Cooper thinks we should hire a new doctor.
I think it's time we move on.
I just don't want to rush into anything.
"When we find... if we find someone,"
I want it to be the right person.
"Addison, explain to the man that married his college sweetheart that the best way to get over a breakup is to move fast, throw yourself into a relationship."
"I mean, drunken, impulsive rebound hiring."
"Naomi is gone, man."
You gotta let it go.
What is wrong with you two?
What?
We made a pact.
Addison and I are ignoring our problems.
We are not going to talk or think about our problems anymore.
Nothing even closethinking or talking about our problems.
We're gonna be strong.
Strong.
"In denial, but strong."
Strong.
"Yeah, well, that's, um, you know... stupid."
You the one that's hurting him.
[Parnell] I ain't got time for this shit.
"You okay, baby?"
They said it would be more fun than a Ferris wheel.
They said?
"I ain't always gon' be here, so you listen up good, you hear?"
"They two kind of people out there, discerners and fools."
Discerner know the difference between what people say and what people mean.
Fools...only hear what they want to hear.
You got to know the difference out there.
"You hear me, Adam?"
"How I know, Mama?"
You watch they eyes.
"A mouth smile easy, but not eyes."
"[Al] So my wife's new husband is younger, better looking, better job, bigger dick... [laughter] ...nicer car."
Why would she leave me?
Just because I made noise when I chew?
"Well, she made noise when she chewed-- his cock in my bed."
[laughter]
Hey.
[Al] The kids were home.
[laughter]
"Hey, keep it tight."
Haul ass offstage when you see that light.
[Al] I'm back in the dating world.
- [Al] Nobody knows.
"- Man, look."
"About the other night, I'm sorry."
"Okay, you were cool and I wasn't."
It won't happen again.
It's disrespectful to the next comic when you running the light.
Disrespect for who?
"A glass of sherry wine, sir?"
No.
"No, thanks."
"Well, would you consider a letter from Monte Carlo, sir?"
- I'll take the sherry wine too.
"- Yes, sir."
"Miss Beatrix should be returning home soon now, shouldn't she?"
Yes.
"Yes, Poole."
Hobson was telling me that they were expected.
"Bad news, sir?"
Miss Beatrix and her father are going to Aix-les-Bains.
"Oh, I'm sorry, sir."
"Sir Charles' health, no doubt?"
"Yes, yes."
"Yes, Sir Charles' health, no doubt."
"If you'll forgive me, sir, it upsets me to see you like this."
It isn't right.
"All work, as the saying goes, sir."
"They say there's a very interesting musical show at the Vanity Fair, sir."
"Very comical, you know, sir."
"And very daring, if you follow my meaning, sir."
"Yeah, I follow your meaning, Poole."
"But I don't think it would be wise, even though it is comical."
"Quite so, sir."
"- I'll fetch you another glass, sir."
"- Oh, never mind, Poole."
"Thanks for the pay, sir."
"Hey, hey, hey!"
Here.
"What's the idea, governor?"
"Oh, I beg your pardon, sir."
It's said!
To put the wife to take care...
Are Ogami-sama's orders.
Even if he says so....
Hotoke-san is praying for mercy.
Don't worry.
Ogami-sama will give us a quick answer...
I'm sure it will send us armed troops.
Help!
Well...
In this town... there's nothing left to take.
In that case we shouldn't be helping wandering samurais...
That demon... could be a white bear?
"No, its 10 feet tall, and it's a red big monster, demon like."
A monster...
We are begging you to help us.
"Exterminate the demon, please!"
"Since then, that demon, night after night keeps coming..."
"Kidnaps young girls, and destroys everything,"
"Already in this town, that's the only girl left."
We are not able to hold that girl any longer.
There's nothing to do.
No one can match with that thing...
Kao!
"O-samurai-sama, I beg you!"
"In the name of God and Buddah, we depend on you, Samurai-sama."
A bear!
There's nothing to do... nothing to do...
A demon came.
Save me... please...

Pentangeli is alive.
-How did they get their hands on him?
-Roth.
"He engineered it, Michael."
When Frankie went to make a deal with the Rosato brothers they tried to kill him.
He thought you double-crossed him.
"Our people with the detectives said he was half dead, scared and shouted that you'd turned on him."
"They already had him on possession, bookmaking, murder one and more."
The FBI has him airtight.
"He's on an army base, 24 hour guards."
We can't get to him.
You've opened yourself to five counts of perjury.
What about Fredo?
What does he know?
"He says he doesn't know anything, and I believe him."
"Roth, he played this one beautifully."
I'm going to talk to Fredo.
"I haven't got a lot to say, Mike."
We have time.
I was kept pretty much in the dark.
I didn't know all that much.
What about now?
Is there anything you can help me out with?
Anything you can tell me now?
"Hide yourselves, wait for my sign, then use your knives."
Right.
[Sanye] Hold it!
So you're Lun Sanye.
Uh sure.
"Truly, brother, I'm sorry I didn't meet you when you first arrived in this place."
Sorry. (Laughing)
"Yeah, but you sent your men to come and meet me, and I'm grateful."
"Ah, it was nothing."
Maybe there was a mistake there.
Wanna come to my house?
Please?
Please. (Chuckling)
"Sit down, sit down."
"Uh, what are you called?"
Jeng-Ko Cheng.
I'm a police officer from Shandong.
I'm here to arrest you.
You see?
For these 19 crimes.
"Ah, never mind."
I really shouldn't have made you come all this way to arrest me.
I'll go quickly with you.
Well then?
What do you say?
"Ah, you are a government officer, right?"
So what?
(laughing)
"When you get promoted to officer rank, or you've been arranged to become police commissioner, how much money do you think you'll make each month?"
"Working for government, money's not important."
"Ah, let's not talk so foolishly."
We can be good friends.
"Do you see him here, laying down the law?"
No.

Why is he doing this?
"Well, those are all valid questions, but they're not for you and I to discuss, so..."
Why not?
Why?
Because.
"In here, we talk about you."
Right?
Your life...
"and your choices and, lo and behold, your list."
But I can't just ignore what's happening to him.
"Kai, he has no one."
"I feel responsible, and so should you."
"I mean, you let Dr. Fred send me to his future for a reason."
Yes.
I did.
"And, you know, it's a decision that I've since come to regret."
"Well, then why did you agree?"
"Because I thought that it would help you, that it might provide for you some useful, you know, perspective."
"But instead, you've gotten completely caught up in his life."

"Oh, my God, he's not late."
"And the advance he gave us was huge, and we've already spent it."
What?
I didn't get any money.
You've only been working here a day.
Don't get greedy.
You know what?
I'll stall him.
"Anderson, how lovely to see you."
"This is my collaborator, Melanie."

"If anything, we need less time."
Fantastic.
I want to hear it after I take this.
- Is there a place I can...
"- Oh, yes."
Right down here.
I keep daydreaming about the stuff that I wanted to do.
Get really drunk at a college party.
Go windsurfing.
Get married and have kids.
Stupid stuff like that.
It's not stupid.
Even after I got really sick I kept talking myself into believing that I had more time.
At least enough to do some of those things.
Sean Simmons?
You know what?
Hold on a second.
"Sean, I can't get you into college, and windsurfing's nuts."
But you know what?
"Come on, let's get out of here."
- For real?
"- Yeah, come on."
Not unless you have someplace else to go.
- I'm supposed to get him home.
"- Yeah, could you call his mom for us?"
- Tell her we went on a date.
- I'll have him back by curfew.
Maybe.
Say maybe.
Abby.
Abby.
"Listen, I got ahold of Sonia Riley and I told her to call you here if she hears from Eric."
I'll keep my eye open for messages.
Can you get this banana bag to that guy?
My leg-splint girl's screaming.
The Soupbox for lunch?
"Oh, you' re busy."
We could go to that place across the street.
I'll keep my word.
Forget the rules.
I want him dead because he exposed his identity.
"I'm the boss now, and you'll do things my way."
"Okay, you kill him for me."
"Ifyou blow it, you're dead meat."
I paid you well enough.
"Eddie, this could be a lead."
"Six months ago, Weng's partner, Chu, was cut down in Club Nine."
The killer was never caught... but he accidentally blinded a singer.
What was her name?
Jenny.
She hasn't recovered yet.
Life's cheap.
It only takes one bullet.
He's no ordinary assassin.
I hope we'rejust looking for one man.
If I'm not mistaken... this man is not a cold-blooded murderer.
"It only takes one bullet, cold-blooded or not."
He risked his life to save the little girl.
And if he did hurt the singer by accident... he's probably contacted her.
Ifwe meet again
We'll find out where we stand
But perhaps there will be no tomorrow
Only time will tell
-Jeffrey?
- I'm notJeffrey.
I'm sorry.
I don't see too well.
I mistookyou for my friend.
It's a beautiful song.
Could you sing it again?
What was your mission?
To have fun.
And drive the wheels off it.
That takes serious effort.
You have ruined it!
They were new!
I should've got some second-hand ones.
Running an old knacker is a good idea because track days aren't covered by road insurance.
If I wanted to get insurance it'd be around £120 for the day.
So I go out without it.
"If you broke it though, stick it in a ditch and go, ""Look!"
"What happened? "" I've heard that happens."

I've seen cars pushed onto the road.
This is the Palmer Jaguar.
A track day thunderbolt.
And a more fitting remedy for a man who had once proclaimed...
I am a driving god!
Oh my goodness!
This is a properly great car.
It uses the three-litre V6 out of Jaguar's X-Type.
It has 300bhp and it weighs 600 kilos.
"That is very, very light."
"And it means it's very, very fast."
It really can travel at some incredible speeds.
"Straight up to...120, 130."
Absolutely awesome power in this thing.
Turn it in far here.
Use that torque.
The lowdown power.
Come on!

-The entrance is closed.

It's not possible.

But we're running late!
I'll see to that now.
What are you doing?
You!
I told you we're running late.
Understand?
You can lose your driver's license for that!
You don't have the authority.
We have a charter flight!
I heard you.
But I can't do anything.
OK?
It's not far to the terminal.
You can walk there.
Walk there yourself!
If I let just one car in I'll be fired!
Hey you...
Stop that!
Come on!
It's alright.
I'll walk.

"All right, show me."
"But not here, Then where?"
In your hotel.
All right.
Come.
Tell me who shot the fire?
Fire shot from there and we were here
And you.
"Yes, Madam."
Then come.
Yes!
Madam!
What are you doing?
"A weapon without riot,"
Didn't you fire a shot to him?
"Hey, search him, Yes!"
"If you don't mind, Sir!"
Why you always searching?
You didn't know that police officers didn't leave any chance.
"Do you understand, Come with me to police station."
Why police station?

"Where are you, Ta-pei?"
Ta-pei
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
What are you doing?
"Any orders, Brother Chin?"
Where's the old fellow called Chang Seventh?
He went to gather some wine-making materials
He stole our master's nine-dragon jade cup lf you can't find him by tomorrow
Then just move this winery out of here!
Yes-please report to the master that I want to keep renting this place
The rental's up 30 per cent
About the nine-dragon cup... I'll surely make him to give me back!
Stop!
What are you doing?
come to give back the nine-dragon jade cup give back the nine-dragon's jade cup?
"Give way, be quick!"
"Bastard, you dare come to start trouble?"
The cup's broken!
Report it to Master!
Back off!
The man will kill you.
Kill you.
Understood?
"Yes, sir."
Hello.
- How are you?
- All right.
Your tie is crooked.
You just knocked everything crooked.
- How are my teeth?
- Your teeth are fine.
Perfume?
That's a first.
So I've been going over the possibles.
And I've been sniffing ten grand.
"Nothing in Artie's hit list suggests a multi-part object, which means we're looking for one thing and it should be in their possession."
Why?
It's Carson's rule of linear transfer.
It means they have to have it on them.

Someone's been paying attention.
Some of us longer than others.
Let's assume that it's a single artifact shared by two suspects.
We each take one and we compare notes.
I'll take lady luck.
You take her date.
And I got these.
- I...
- What is it?
"I cleaned 'em with alcohol, all right?"
So...
"But you might gain many detractors, calling you a traitor who sold out her kingdom."
I don't mind.
"If you wish it, you may kill me afterwards."
So...
"Don't kill everyone, please."
Very well.
The battle is over.
"Please call off your soldiers, Rear Admiral Klom."
"Wait, damn you!"
"Hey, are you okay?"
"I believe in you, and your king."
Huh?
"Rear Admiral Klom, I can't bring myself to move."
Would you mind helping me stand?
Sure thing.
Thank you.
"With all of you, I'm sure the people of Estabul will be..."
"Again, people have died."
"Again, I made Claugh kill people."
I knew this war was necessary.
That's why I didn't charge Froaude with any crimes.
"I put Claugh in charge because I wanted to save more lives, even if only a few."
Or is that just my excuse?
"Brother Sion, are you going to cry?"
I've read about it in picture books.
"That's a face on the verge of tears, right?"
It's the first time Iris has seen one!
"Sister Ferris never cries, and Brother Lucile always smiles, which is really scary!"
Lucile is quite scary.
"Hey, are you going to cry?"
C'mon!
- I won't cry.
My phone has a clock.
And they subsist on a diet...
- of pointlessly weird combinations.
- Ooh.
"Hey, do you want to split a kimchi cupcake with bacon frosting?"
They are the best here.
"Uh, yeah."
"Yeah, that'll go great with my cucumber-jalapeño egg cream."
- Chug it!
Come on.
Come on.
We gotta get going.
"- Right, okay."
"Then, later, at a club in Chinatown... somehow located beneath a manhole cover, it got weird."
"God, I just love those tiny gray hairs in your eyebrows."
Old men are so sexy.
"All right, to be fair... some of those gray hairs were dried egg cream."
"Turns out when you projectile vomit on skates, you roll right into the spray."
How old does she think you are?
So were you in Vietnam?
Hold that groan.
Charlie was everywhere.
She's hot.
She likes old guys.
Don't judge me!
"Anyway, when we got out on the dance floor, thi..."
I swear.
This is what all the 20-year-olds look like.
"I wanna thank you for your service to this nation, Private."
- Colonel.
- Oh.
- I gotta end this.
"I'm a little stressed, OK?"
"Well, I'm just the guy to relieve that stress."
- How's that?
- It helps.
Mm-hmm.
- Ow!
"- Was that a good ""ow""?"
"No, it wasn't you."
It was this.
Whose earring is this?
"- Well, it's not yours?"
- No.
"Well, I-I-I have no idea."
"Honestly, I don't know who-whose earring that is."
"Alan, sweetheart, I'm not accusing you."
- Why not?
- I know you're not having an affair.
"Oh, you think I'm safe?"
You think other women aren't attracted to me?
- I haven't said anything.
"- And, boy, are you oh so wrong."
"Just today at the store, this slim little blonde with a low-cut dress, she came up to me and asked me if the bread was fresh."
"Alan, sweetheart, I know there are still many women that still are attracted to you."
- You don't sound very threatened.
- I'm threatened.
I know I could lose you at any moment.
- (blows)
"- Oh, stop that."
We just found an earring in our bed.
"I know... a cheap, tacky one, the kind of thing a teenager would... wear."
- Eric!
- What about Eric?
Listen to this.
She was a prodigy.
Had a breakdown at 16 and was institutionalized.
Took a while to get these records.
Emile Sayles was her teacher.
"Duval, listen..."
"Oh, it gets better."
Both their names are on the condolence books of the other victims.
And you were right about the admissions director.
He did have a secret.
Liz Kenyon was sleeping with him to get access to the applications.
He was afraid of getting fired.
That's what you saw.
Duval...
I have the warrant to Kenyon's home and office.
We're mounting up now.
This was good work.
She's been killing these kids.
We're gonna stop her.
"Skip past the part where even though I asked you to wait, you broke into her office."
Then what?
She was on the floor when I got here.
She was gone when I got back.
When you got back from where?
I went after Emile.
You saw him?
No.
No.
"Emile Sayles, her piano tutor, has been dead since 1997."
There is no Emile.
She signed both names in those condolence books because Emile is only in her head.
It's just her.
(both) Yes!
Good morning... master.
"- Morning, excellency."
- CIaudette.
Ah.
velvet flowers.
"Did you make these, CIaudette?"
I have a tiny talent and an enormous amount of time.
But have you come to work?
I will leave you in peace.
"Oh, no. (giggles)"
It's very bad.
"No, don't!"
Ooh!
That's really quite good.
"One, two."

"You're a fine shot, sir."
I can see you're not one of those perfumed prancers in there.
- What do you say to a little hunting?
- I am standing guard on my mistress.
That one?
"She doesn't need your protection, by God."
Fascinating creature.
I'm sure she'd rather come hunting with us than sit around arranging her flounces.
"""One warm word from you and I Iive."
"One brutal word and I die."""
"""It doesn't matter, for I am not afraid of death any more."""
"""I have already visited the beyond in your music."""
- will you take it to him?
- Why don't you take it to him yourself?
I've been avoiding him all morning.
She came home to her father's estate.
She was young and happy and hopeful.
"She read book s and played music for her mother and sister, and laughed while she waited for some nobleman to come and ask her hand in marriage."
The French came instead.
She hid and watched all they did.
She saw them blind her father.
She saw them rape her mother and sister Maria who begged the French to kill them.
They spared her sister but killed her mother.
"At the end, she was raped as well."
"When the French were gone, she buried her mother."
"And on her grave, she made a sacred oath."
Death to the French.
She plays no music now.
Nor reads book s.
Nor smiles or sings.
But rides the hills and hunts the French and hopes to die.
But today I saw her smile.
She smiled at you.
It almost broke my heart.
"For that alone, I thank you."
Buenas noches.
No that one's a bit sad
I'll play a reel for Miss Teresa.
"""Salamanca."""
- Who goes there?
"- Sharpe. 95th, the Rifles."
Advance and be recognised.
"Pass, friend."
"Stand easy, Cooper."
"Can I ask you a question, sir?"
"Where did you learn to fight so dirty, sir?"
"Same place as you, Cooper."
It's not Paul.
Why am I having a hard time believing that?
Hmm.
I don't know.
Let's dig deep.
"Yeah, let's..."
let's do that.
Maybe because of your mother?
Excuse me?
- Yeah.
- Excuse me?
She told me all about her addiction and how she left you guys and how it fucked you up.
And I am starting to see that.
Have you even ever been to therapy?
"No, I haven't."
"Well, maybe you should try it."
Why are you letting this guy take care of you?
- He's not.
- He is.
He's giving you shelter.
So what are you doing in return?
"What the fuck are you giving him in return, Laura?"
!
You think I'm fucking him so that I can stay in this house?
"I think it's a fucking reasonable fucking suggestion, Laura!"
"- Oh, my God, Jay."
- Don't you think?
Not every relationship is transactional!
Every fucking relationship is transactional!
That's the fucking definition of a fucking relationship!
I can't do this.

"Oh, look at this."

Can you believe he sold his glasses on the street?
Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig?
- Would you do that?
"- No, definitely not."
I'm pretty sure I wouldn't.
Know what else?
He picked up that woman in the coffee shop.
- The one who sits by herself?
- Yeah.
- How?
- Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.
- Really?
Debby told me she fell in love with him because he has perspective.
She thinks a guy who lies about an illness so he can get some phoney hair has perspective?
- He picked her up?
- Walked right over to her table.
Wow.
Jake.
"Jake, take a look."
See?
You're not the only one who has them.
I have them too.
- Where did you get those?
"But, Mr. Connors, there has to be a reason you thought initially that it was sabo..."
I said I wasn't thinking.
Okay?
My son just died.
PRIDE:
"Mr. Connors,"
"I can't imagine how difficult this must be for you, but our job is to find out what happened to your son."
"You know that, right?"
Sure.
Of course.
Do you know of any reason why somebody might have wanted to hurt Jared?
I-I don't know.
"What about you, Ms. Wells?"
Did you see anything suspicious?
(sighs) No.
(clears throat)
"We were just chasing each other around the track, you know, messing around."
Jared was showing me how to race.
So it was your first time.
I've been in racecars before.
I'm the advance coordinator for Warbury Racing.
We're in town this week for the race.
You two work for the same team?
"Yeah, about a year now, yeah."
That's how I met Jared.
We've been dating ever since.
Was he a good driver?
He was great.
RUSS:
"Well, he's been racing his whole life."
All the way back to go-carts.
He was gonna turn pro after his discharge.
The ultimate secret sex spot.
All these people around...
Where should we start?
Let's hold off on that for right now.
We're on high alert.
Who choose out this song?
It's so good!
You're monopolizing the dean's time.
I'm sorry.
"Dean Bowman, this is Ashleigh Hawards, social chair at ZB, would you excuse me?"
I'm gonna go check on the refreshments.
It's such a treat to have you here.
So I guess you're also a big fan of the book?
Which book?
Oh The Great Gatsby!
Yeah!
Totally!
It's one of my favorites.
Mia Farrow is one of the great tragic characters in modern literature.
- Awesome!
"- Better than watch movies alone, right?"
It's the Omega Chi dropout!
"We love you, man!"
You're beautiful!
Good going man!
Omega Chis suck!
I'm starting to feel more like a trophee than prospective pledge.
"No, I want you here, 'cause you're a good friend."
"and all around, great guy."
You'd be around other great guys.
- As opposed to Evan?
- As opposed to Evan.
Was me and the old man.
"As of this morning, got to be just me."
"Dispatch, we have a code 32 off Carrion Road."
"Burning pretty good, by the smell of it."
I think I found us Ken Mersey.
"What the hell happened to you, Ken?"
Where'd you get off to?
Shit.
"Well, that's everyone that's come in."
Closest thing to a Molotov cocktail these folks have seen is a broken air conditioner.
"Sorry about that, Deputy."
But I don't believe your friend is here.
Didn't say he was a friend.
And it's Sheriff.
Is Ken in there?
Is he okay?
"Don't give me that look, Wallace."
"Surprising, is all."
Ken Mersey is a good man.
He looks after me.
"Oh, Wallace, stop it."
What do you know about the truck?
He bought it.
He told me to fix it up and sell it to Shep.
You know he was smuggling ammunitions across the border in that truck?
- That's a lie.
"- Well, whatever he ain't telling you got him in trouble last night, got him confronted."
By who?
Still sorting that out.
But whoever that may be...
I ain't gonna tell you that Ken Mersey don't got his own consequences coming to him.
"Ah, fuck."
I haven't been in the back of a car in years.
"Come on, butch."
Be a pal?
"Sorry, krzeminski."
I got plans.
"Yauch, what about you?"
Told my gal I'd take her to a show.
I can't swing it.
Why don't you ask carter?
Dooley would kill me if I let a lady take nights.
"Besides, she can barely make her own shift."
"Work day starts at 9:00 a.M., honey."
"Tell me, agent krzeminski,"
Who are you bringing to the show...
Your wife or your girlfriend?
Come on in.
Have a seat.
We really appreciate you coming down here
"To talk with us, mr."
Jarvis.
That isn't already in the missing-car report I filed.
That report might take us a while to dig up.
"You see, the nypd aren't as efficient"
"As the ssr at record-keeping,"
"Which is saying something, because our files are a wreck."
That hurts.
My filing's impeccable.
Isn't that stark's butler?
You know this guy?
Only from the file.
Do you think he was really involved
"Well, maybe he didn't blow the place up,"
-My butt too!
What do we do?
!
-What's going on?
"-I don't know, I don't know!"
Oh please!
"Oh mother, father!"
Oh please...!
Oh Jesus!
"Oh yes, right there!"
"Oh please, please!"
Jesus!
To commit such dirty deeds in such a divine school like this...
"It's because of an allergy to mushrooms, if you take the medication and put on some ointment, you'll be better soon."
I should have checked the body sooner.
Is our school nurse's office a welfare office?
Or a hospital?
So unbelievable...
Is he an idiot or something...?
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
The money that was in the house was spent paying for the taxi last night...
"But with my whole strange body thing, I couldn't go to the hospital."
I came because I was worried something may happen to precious Yoon Jae's body...
But...
Did you get into a lot of trouble?
-Are you okay now?
-Yeah.
This guy must be really healthy!
I mean the medicine worked like a charm on his body!
Make sure to eat something when you get home.
And take your medicine too.
"Just doing your job, Officer."
But I will have to warn my fellow air marshals about skittish Navy cops.
"Okay, you could have quietly said something when I badged you."
And you are aware of the recent chatter?
It's my job to know.
"But look, I don't think anyone waiting for my Paris flight saw that, anyway, so let's just forget it."
All right.
"No hard feelings, Mr. Beers."
I guess we could all use one.
One what?
A beer.
Your name.
Ah.
Right.
Huh.
"""Huh"" what?"
It's Gibbs.
Want me to tell him?
"No, let me."
Put him on speaker.
"You've got us both, Gibbs."
You got anything to report?
"Nothing, boss."
Just compared notes with a... rather cranky air marshal.
He's aware of the chatter.
Does he know that the chatter has changed?
"Threat level's been increased, and now it specifically mentions DC metropolitan airports."
That is a game changer.
It still could be nothing.
Just keep your heads on a swivel.
Call if anything's changed.
You got anything else?
"I'm sorry sir, I can't help you unless a crime has been committed."
Has a crime been committed?
"Please, I wouldn't ask if it weren't extremely important."
Sorry sir.
"No crime, no information."
What if I told you I was hit by this car?
I don't see any bruises.
"If you did, would you give me an address?"
"No, but the police might."
"What is it, sweetie?"
"Tired, huh?"
You wanna go take a nap?
I want to report a hit and run.
Bring it back when you're finished.
Fill it out over there.
Mr. Reznik.
You sure about these plate numbers?
743CRN.
"All right, that's the one."
Do you ever have a car stolen?
"No, why?"
Cause the car that allegedly hit you was your own.
"1969, red Pontiac Viper registered to your name."
Nearly a year ago you reported it as being totalled in a wreck.
Do you realise it's a felony to file a bogus police report?
"Hey, wait a minute."
You got some explaining to do.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
- Hey!
Hey!
"[Deep voice] ""Don't pay too much, pilgrim."""
Ours.
Great!
"The hilkin department store lingerie day for men, beer decathlon out in munhall, we do that, and some national stuff, too."
It's a very strong list of clients.
Very.
We bill almost 2 million a year.
All right.
"Well,"
I'll look over all the papers and see what we can figure out.
Great.
"Nice to meet you, Jake."
"Yeah, you, too."
"If you have any questions, call my accountant."
"Mom, come on."
I told my friends
"I'd be there, like, 20 damn minutes ago."
Don't you want to spend some time with your Uncle and your cousin Nick?
No.
3 more days of winter recess till he goes back to boarding school.
3 more days.
I know what you mean.
"So, uh, what's with the kid?"
My nephew.
She's your sister?
"No, she's my wife's sister."
"But now, Jake, I want you to understand"
"I don't like to mix family with business, so that's why I want you on point for this one, ok?"
Fine.
Got it covered.
Woman:
I'm looking for James mooney!
Would benefit if you were dead?
"Gentlemen, I'd appreciate it if you would leave."
I'm not going to stand by and have you impugn
The integrity of my niece.
I resent the implication that Audrey is a murderess.
"Oh, but please, uh, Ms..."
"Goodbye, gentlemen."
"Uh, one more question, Ms. Ramsey, if you please."
"We could find out without your help,"
But it'll just take more time.
"What is it, Detective Burris?"
OTIS:
Could you make a guess as to the total value
"Of your estate, please?"
I suggest that your superiors contact my attorney.
His name is Henry Claypool.
"This way out, please."
"All right, girl."
It's OK.
You'll get fed.
Jeff!
Why don't you take her out while I get her dinner?
"Come on, lady."
Out we go.
"Oh, come on, you old mutt."
Now do your thing.
"Jeff, don't talk to her like that."
Here.
Give her her dinner.
"If we're going out, I'm going to slip into the shower."
Do you mind?
"I don't mind, as long as I'm invited."
He can hear our conversation from ground floor itself.
Control yourself you flirt!
Who is she?
She is the milk vendor.
"If a house is available for rent, many would hop in to check."
"- Hey Paramasivam, is she yours?"
- I don't deserve her man.
With such a rotten face you need a charming girl like her?
- I asked if she is your client?
- Yes
- She is looking for office space.
- Do you like it?
"-Yes, I do."
- I am impressed too.
- I am very impressed.
How about the rent?
- I am very impressed too.
Why does he grope me for that?
I need this office.
How much is the rent?
"20,000 as rent, and an advance amount for 10 months."
- 20000?
- Yes madam.
- I can't afford that and I don't need such a big space..
"Don't miss the house gawking at this girl, Karthik!"
Ask!
"- Sir, I saw and confirmed the deal first."
Isn't it?
- Please fix it for me.
- Let me speak with the loud mouth.
- Sir fix it for me immediately.
- I shall do it madam.
And watch her bleed into her brain?
"No, thanks."
"- Push the meds, Inez."
- She's alert.
"- Pupils equal, good tone."
- Do it now.
.5 versed going in.
"Come on, Kerry, we've both seen enough head trauma to develop gut feelings about this."
"Yeah, and my gut says intubate."
She needs a tube.
Giving the vec.
Suction.
The scope.
- Where are they taking my daughter?
- She's going up to the CT.
But what are all those tubes?
Why isn't she moving?
The tube helps her breathe.
It's just a precaution.
Sometimes babies have to be sedated for CAT scans.
It doesn't mean anything's wrong.
Have the... police found anything?
It's still early.
They will.
I should have waited...
till it stopped raining.
No one can control the weather.
The good news is that your brain and belly CT are normal.
"Unfortunately, you've broken your breastbone and we'll need to monitor your heart to make sure it wasn't bruised."
But I didn't have to go out.
I...
I could have waited.
"Come on, wrap up your gear."
You're coming with me.
Hurry up.
Guruji.
If it ain't young Toad Face.
Fancy meeting you here.
Vile dog.
"For that insolence, you shall grovel before my son."
"You shall grovel, I say!"
Look here.
"I'm a soldier of Her Majesty the Queen, and I don't grovel before any heathen."
"Kabul, take him to the tower... and teach him the error of false pride."
Take him away!
"In those drear gray hours before dawn, just go out and chase elephants."
Beats counting sheep a million miles.
"What do you mean, elephants?"
This ain't elephants.
"This is Annie, my Annie."
I'll find her if I have to turn out the whole British Army.
What the blazes is this?
"Good morning, gentlemen."
Good morning.
What the blazes are you here for?
I've come to replace Sgt. Ballantine.
"Higginbotham, I could just fall on your neck."
I got a better neck than mine you can fall on.
That's a good one.
"Hello, there!"
"Tommy, hello!"
How wonderful of you to meet us.
"I came here to surprise you, and here you are, surprising me."
"- Good morning, Sgt. MacChesney."
"Take care of yourself and whatever you do, do it honorably."
That's the family motto.
"Do me a favor, Dad?"
"Certainly, son."
Take care of Betty if she needs anything.
"She won't ask, but she might need it."
I'll keep an eye on her.
"Would all the draftees assemble over here, please."
"Come right in, folks."
"Now, as chairman of the draft board, let me say that all of us regret having to send any of you men off to war."
"You carry our love, our devotion and our undying gratitude."
Please try to come back safely to your homes.
"Now, we've prepared some gift packages."
"If you'll just step up here, I'll hand them out."
"Peyton Place draftees in the bus, on the double."
Let's go.
- Best of luck.
"- Come on, boys, hurry it up."
Make the goodbyes short.
"Name, loud and strong."
Last name.
"- Culver, Jones... ."
- Harvey.
Keep going.
You boys are gonna love the Army.
- Elliot.
"- Elliot, right."
Hurry up in the back.
Plenty of seats.
Nothing in the world's gonna stop me from coming back.
"I love you, Selena."
"I love you, Ted."
"Let's get another tube in, keep pumping in the saline."
We need to get her BP up.
- What can I tell them?
"- Nothing, say nothing!"
"Just get him here, fast."
Ready to insert the left tube.
Got no response to stimulus at any of the extremities.
"Right pupil's blown, left is slow to dilate."
We need to get her...
- She's in V-tach.
- Damn it!
"Who the hell was she chasing, anyway?"
Lanagan Pike; fell into a shallow pool of water and sodium hydrochloride.
"Burns to the right side, deep laceration to the left thigh."
"Frig, man, that burns!"
I need that one for questioning.
- You can have him when I'm done.
- A police officer's been injured.
"1, 2, 3, up."
Backstage is off limits!
"Listen, man, just get Yannick."
"Yannick knows her, man!"
"Her name is Natasha, she has brown eyes, she's a dancer in there,"
"- Yannick knows her, she's totally sweet..."
"- Hey, hey!"
- Take a walk.
"- Dude, listen to me."
"I'm sorry about what I said about your lack of neck that was hurtful, OK?"
"But I gotta find her, man, you gotta help me!"
"Dude, come on!"
"Trust me, you're better off."
You?
You just need someone to distract her friend.
"Oh, thank you, that is really solid of you."
I didn't volunteer... oh!
She's hot!
I volunteer.
"So, how'd it go with Emma?"
Not great.
"She, uh, did not think it was a date."
"Neither did Kevin, the dude she ended up making out with."
"This whole ""taking action"" thing is a disaster."
Except for Kevin... it's working gangbusters for Kevin.
[groans]
"Amy's nice, but she's so boring"
I almost didn't have sex with her.
You and Amy had sex?
How did that happen?
"Well, that's a conversation you should probably have with a parent."
Hey!
Holy hell!
She's boring from inside the house!
Okay.
She's not the first woman to stalk me after a night of mind-blowing sex.
"Mason, you go distract her..."
"Dude, Amy works here, in payroll."
She works here now?
!
"Well, she's not the first woman to get a job to stalk me after a night of mind-blowing sex."
Did you guys even talk last night?
She's worked here for three years.
She started here three years ago just to stalk me?
!
Jack?
Why am I still alive?
I made a promise to your wife.
"""You killed her."""
- Do not.
That's what they want to make you believe.
Because you did?
Why did you take it from me?
Mara was my creator.
"She got me up, knew I was different."
She was my mother.
You do not have mothers!
The quarantine of the Federation did it for the test.
So that we begin to show genetic anomalies.
Anomalies that the superior command did not like.
Like what.
- Hair?
- Some of us.
"For others, like me, or more Advanced."
"We have developed the ability, to reproduce."
Your wife kept the secret for a long time.
"When she threatened, with scattering the secret."
The top command entered.
They wanted to keep it a secret.
At all costs
Stop!
They have no right...
Your investigation is over.
Dirty Noid-Bitch!
"No, you murdered her!"
I saw it with my own eyes!
I did not kill her!
I tried to save her.
You have reached the voicemail box of...
Shit.
"All right, all right."
Is this one of those memory foam beds?
I've heard great things.
I hope you don't mind.
"We were waiting, so I had to take a little cat nap."
I'm not a young man anymore.
Who are you?
How did you get in my apartment?
I had some empathy for your father and his illness.
A man in his position shouldn't have to worry about owing his associate $50 million.
"I was willing to work with him, but then he was gone, in the wind, an apparition."
So I started to think... his sudden lack of presence was so that he wouldn't have to pay
Omar Sandahl.
That's me.
You killed Donnie.
Do you know where your father is?
No.
Hmm.
Then it's a good thing...
I know where you are.
Because if he disappears... you inherit his debt.
I'll get my money.
Finally.
Anika.
"""Sorry, been busy."
All good.
"Talk soon."""
Hmm.
Well...
There are some advantages to having the place still to ourselves.
And they thought that a bush pilot was a pilot for George Bush.
"And right after the gulf war,"
George Bush was not a very popular person.
I tried to quickly explain that a bush pilot had nothing at all to do with George Bush.
Claytor decides to make a brief stop in Zambia to refuel and chart his course to Burundi.
Bueno Bungee.
How's everything here?
"I am from Ndola, but I needed to refuel."
Hello.
How are you?
Nice to meet you.
I'm Claytor...
We are just from around here.
The lanky American is an unusual sight wherever he lands and his grasp of African languages is often a crowd pleaser.
This is my first time ever to come here.
It's nice to meet you.
"Oh, it's very nice to meet you."
"When landing, you're suppose to pay something - a landing fee."
How much should I pay you?
I want to pay.
How much?
How many kilograms?
It's one ton.
5-60 5-60.
How many U.S. Dollars is that?
It's about one U.S. Dollar.
I understand that
Can I pay you two U.S. Dollars?
So is that okay?
This is more than okay.
Okay no but please the change is for you guys
You can have it.
They are supposed to be in prison!
That is where terrorists belong!
These fuckers are goin' down.
Dead.
Or alive.
Tell them that in your fake ching-chong language.
Shut up!
You're an idiot.
"I don't know what you're saying, buddy... but fuck you."
- Fuck me?
- Will you let him talk to you like that?
"- Listen, no, sit down."
- Fuck me?
"Hey, look, man, we're in Alabama."
"Wow, we actually get a first-hand look at the South, huh?"
"Hey, this wasn't supposed to be a trip through the South, OK?"
This was supposed to be the most romantic week of my life.
Remember that?
Before you fucked it up?
You remember that?
"Just chill, OK?"
We'll be out of this situation.
"You'll be up in Maria's guts in no time, all right?"
Hey.
"She's not some skank, man."
"I've never felt this way about anyone before, really."
What the fuck?
Why am I talking to you about this?
"It's not like you would understand, so--"
I want to be happy
"I want to be happy, just like--"
"Excuse me, please."
- I'm in the middle of bidding.
"Well, you better take a look at this first."
This is the real Ricky Stancati.
You've got an imposter.
I appreciate the update.
Ricardo.
- Do we have a deal?
- We have a rat.
Or a cop.
Or a fed.
"D.E.A. Agent, reporter, maybe."
"Listen, it doesn't matter."
"The point is, you're busted, and whoever you're working with..."
They're dead already.
I don't need a gun.
"When I kill a man, I use my hands."
"Before you die, tell me something."
Do you believe in an afterlife?
I believe in angels.
Go.
Put your weapons down slowly!
Put 'em down!
"Amanda, I'm gonna get you home."
Your nightmare is over.
You'll get medical attention and he returned to your familias.
Looks like we closed Finch's last sweatshop.
You don't mind.
Charlie.
We're gonna be bringing in more warm bodies than planned.
"Need some transport, north face of the island."
I spoke to the head of the Bahamian police.
Finch and the bidders have been extradited to the U.S.
"A jerk and Greek bro, and the rest of Omega Chi."
I had a lot of good times there.
It's gonna be a hard decision.
"I don't want it to be about you, or Evan or my dad."
"You know, I just gotta... do what feels right."
Or you'd be picking Kappa Tau.
Need a drink?
"I could use 'bout a million drinks, I've been running around all night."
What do you want?
Sparta hooch?
"Actually, I brought my own."
Nice flask.
"Sorry, I crossed the line, I didn't mean to..."
Apology accepted.
To a long and meaningful friendship.
"Right, friendship."
I gotta go back upstairs.
Find someone.
"Which is why I think in many ways,"
Ferris Bueller is my generation's Gatsby.
So... do you think that Gatsby is really great or just a totally decent guy?
Would you excuse me?
I need to find a bathroom.
I don't think you're heading in the right direction.
Sure I am.
I've seen a lot of people round here.
"Maybe you should use the one upstairs, it's much nicer."
- There's pot pourri.
- That won't be necessary.
"No, you can't go in there."
- Why not?
- A girl got sick.
"I don't trust anyone, including you!"
I know the rules ofthe game.
I'll keep my word.
Forget the rules.
I want him dead because he exposed his identity.
"I'm the boss now, and you'll do things my way."
"Okay, you kill him for me."
"Ifyou blow it, you're dead meat."
I paid you well enough.
"Eddie, this could be a lead."
"Six months ago, Weng's partner, Chu, was cut down in Club Nine."
The killer was never caught... but he accidentally blinded a singer.
What was her name?
Jenny.
She hasn't recovered yet.
Life's cheap.
It only takes one bullet.
He's no ordinary assassin.
I hope we'rejust looking for one man.
If I'm not mistaken... this man is not a cold-blooded murderer.
"It only takes one bullet, cold-blooded or not."
He risked his life to save the little girl.
And if he did hurt the singer by accident... he's probably contacted her.
Ifwe meet again
We'll find out where we stand
But perhaps there will be no tomorrow
Only time will tell
-Jeffrey?
- I'm not Jeffrey.
I'm sorry.
I don't see too well.
I mistookyou for my friend.
I-I didn't kill Coach Nelson.
"Todd Fleming had an alibi for the night Nelson was killed, which leaves you."
Okay!
Okay...
"Yes, we sent the e-mail, okay?"
I'll admit that.
Yeah.
Nice.
"See, my-my dad, he doesn't make a lot of money."
So the only way I'm going to college is if I get a wrestling scholarship.
"Coach Nelson, he moved me up a weight class."
That totally wrecked my chance at State Championship.
"So we thought if we sent these pictures around, maybe it'll get him fired."
So you e-mailed them to yourselves to throw off suspicion?
"Yeah, but that's all we did, okay?"
We had nothing to do the murder.
"Ah, you know what, actually, you kind of did."
'Cause we're thinking it's those pictures that got your coach killed.
Where were you Thursday night?
"I was at, uh, school."
I was at a basketball game.
Got somebody who can vouch for that?
"yeah, yeah."
"My, my-my, my Dad."
He picked me up around 10:00.
What's his name?
Alex Sheridan.
He works at the Manhattan Superior Court.
He's a court officer.
"He was struck by something hard, a club or a pipe."
"It wasn't the son, it was the father."
Court officers have metal batons.
"I'm scared, uncle."
You will be fine.
Lord Hanuman will protect you.
He wants to play with me.
It's a very serious case.
She will live only if we perform an operation on her within 20 hours.
I told her parents about this.
I'm telling you again.
Operation will be performed on her only if you pay 20 lakhs by tomorrow morning.
Actually...
"Okay, I will bring it."
- Take a snap.
- Is it?
You're out of Health ministry.
But you're given Home ministry.
"Then, let's distribute sweets in jail."
Okay.
This is enough for today.
This is the last snap.
I need to go to jail.
Bye.
"Sir, I need 20 lakhs."
You have explained me very clearly.
I will explain you very clearly.
Try to understand.
Government can't help each and everyone.
There are few funds available.
Funds are available...for our benefits.
Let's not talk about that now.
"Since I like you, let me tell you the facts."
"Since it is a small girl, submit an application."
I will help you on some grounds.
- That's gross.
- It's gross.
Totally.
"Listen, I really do have to say that I never, ever thought I would fit in anywhere in that school, and I'm just so happy to have met you."
Christine?
What are you doing here?
"I'm having coffee with my new friend, Marly."
What in the hell are you doing here?
This is my house.
And your friend is my housekeeper.
"You did great out there today, man."
Your swing is really coming along.
I didn't hit the ball once.
"No, but the ball didn't hit you either, so we're doing better than last time, huh?"
"- Let's get washed up for dinner, slugger."
"- Thanks, Dad."
- You did great.
"- Thanks, Uncle Matthew."
"- I'm serious, you did great."
- Thanks.
Really great.
"I'm proud of you, pal."
"God, why can't he be better at baseball?"
Or at least stop using the bat as a dance partner.
[DOOR OPENS]
[SIGHS]
Bad day?
I made a new friend.
"I finally met someone at this school that I connect with, and she's Marly's maid."
A maid?
"Oh, dear."
And she has the audacity to hobnob with a wealthy industrialist like you?
I'll show you to your room.
"What's wrong with them, Higgins?"
Higgins.
Stay here.
Don't leave the room under any circumstances.
"Stay, lads."
Guard.
Go.
Halt!
Go!
Guard!
"'I broke the speed record on the way to Robin's 'but even so, I was too late."
'And my fears were no longer just fears.'
Higgins.
Stop it!
Why can't you go after real intruders the way you go after me?
"Too showy, isnt it?"
"- No way, red is fine"
"Agreed, red"
"I have to learn how to drive - no problem, I will teach you"
We'll go wherever you want to
Where do you want to go?
I'd like to go to the sea
"- OK, we'll go to the sea"
What are you planning to do with your share?
Buy a flat
But that costs too much
"No, if you buy it on instalments"
What's wrong with you?
There's nothing wrong with me I just want a flat of our own
Is this one so bad?
"-No, not bad but..."
- How did he do that so well?
I mean...
This was also...
"We shot that, like, right before Thanksgiving."
- There's your ass again.
- Ass again.
But you look really cute there.
"Hey, look at this ridiculous bedazzled phone that Tris has."
It's a really revealing prop.
- I love the bedazzled phone.
- It's pink and it's sparkly.
"Oh, yeah."
"- Oh, my gosh."
- Psycho.
This is an exciting commentary.
- I think so.
"- Oh, yeah."
"She's got the best mean looks, but she's such a sweetheart."
She is like the sweetest lady.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You all right?
Is she okay?
We should talk about commentary pet peeves.
What's one of your?
"When people are watching the commentary, they're like:"
"""I love this scene."" And everyone goes quiet and listens."
"But when you're listening to a commentary, it's quiet."
"You can't even hear it and you're like, ""Why aren't they saying anything?"""
But this could lull some people to sleep.
I watch these things to go to sleep.
"- Oh, that's sad."
"I'll make it up to you, Kay."
I swear I'll make it up to you.
I'll...
I'm going to change.
I'll change.
I've learned that I have the strength to change.
Then you'll forget about this miscarriage and we'll have another child.
"And we'll go on, you and I."
-We'll go on.
"-Oh, Michael!"
"Michael, you are blind."
It wasn't a miscarriage.
It was an abortion.
"An abortion, Michael."
Just like our marriage is an abortion.
Something that's unholy and evil!
"I didn't want your son, Michael!"
I wouldn't bring another one of your sons into this world!
"It was an abortion, Michael."
It was a son and I had it killed because this must all end!
I know now that it's over.
I knew it then.
"There would be no way, Michael, no way you could ever forgive me."
"Not with this Sicilian thing that's been going on for 2,000..."
-You won't take my children.
-I will.
-You won't take my children!
-They're my children too.
"Fredo, give this to Grandmother."
"Don Ciccio, it's Tommasino."
Allow me the honor of introducing someone.
"My partner in America, in New York."
You look like one of those jerks who's in some lame band and rides a motorcycle without a helmet and has a wallet chain and neck tattoos and a drug problem.
"Not a... a big one, just, uh... enough that he deals a little bit on the side, and... he can never..."
ever be true to one woman.
Finish that damn pickle and do me!
"Okay, you guys know how my mornings usually go."
Why would we care how...
Usually it's like this.
After you.
"Aw, thank you."
"On the house, Robin!"
♪ Take this bagel on the house
♪ Have a paper on the house
♪ I'd give you a house on the house ♪
♪ If I could
♪ You're so beautiful
♪ Everything in life should be free ♪
♪ It's so wonderful to be me!
Mmm.
Wow.
"Do little bluebirds help you get dressed in the morning, too?"
♪ She's exaggerating
♪ To make a point!
But today was different.
That'll be $3.75.
But I didn't have to pay yesterday.
Okay. $7.50.
"Oh, honey-sweetie-baby."
"It's the ring, Robin."
The ring has power.
"When a woman puts on an engagement ring, it's like when Bilbo Baggins wears the One Ring in The Hobbit."
"Okay, can you say that again but not in nerd?"
Sure.
"Lives are in danger--no, no, not for that."
"Dr. Weisfeld, you're under arrest for treason."
Just tell us that the charges aren't true.
We both know.
So just tell us.
- I can't.
They're true.
"- Okay, that's--that's not--"
I had my reasons.
"Artie, homeland security's coming"
To pick you up.
You need to give us a way to help you now.
"You need to concentrate on the mission,"
Not worry so much about me.
Mrs. Frederic fixed this once and she can fix it a--
This whole thing could've been avoided
"If you just told us anything about the sword, the tsuba, your past."
"Anything, Artie, we--we--we could have helped."
We could have run interference with Dickinson.
If you just trusted us.
"So--so what happens now, Artie?"
"I mean, what--what happens with the warehouse?"
"I mean, what, are we in charge?"
what?
I think we should know.
She fixed all this.
Mrs. Frederic.
She fixed all of this years ago.
It's him too.
It--it has to be.
"Okay, Artie,"
"This isn't just about the treason, all right?"
You're going to give mercenaries a bad name.
Dr. Jones... surely you don't think you can escape from this island.
That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be.
All I want is the girl.
If we refuse?
Then your führer has no prize.
"Okay, stand back."
"All of you, stand back."
Stand back.
"Okay, Jones."
You win!
Blow it up.
"Yes, blow it up!"
Blow it back to God.
All your life has been spent in pursuit of archaeological relics.
Inside the Ark are treasures beyond your wildest aspirations.
You want to see it open as well as I.
Indiana... we are simply passing through history.
This...
This is history.
Do as you will.
"Marion, don't look at it."
"Shut your eyes, Marion."
"Don't look at it, no matter what happens."
Ah...
It's beautiful!
Indy?
"Don't look, Marion!"
Keep your eyes shut!
Marion.
"You've done your country a great service, and we thank you and we trust you found the settlement satisfactory."
"Oh, the money's fine."
- Los hermanos...
- The Geckos?
They can help you.
It's prophecy.
[slurping]
"Okay, okay, that's enough."
- [door opens]
- Did you hear that?
[man] Anybody home?
Ranger Gonzalez?
You in there?
"Well, it's about goddamn time."
I've been through hell and high water looking for you.
"Do me a favor, hon."
"You put that thing down, step on over here."
"- What are you doing here, Captain?"
- Shut your trap.
Slide your firearm.
This ain't a social call.
"Okay, okay."
Take it easy.
"Now, where the hell are those bonds?"
"I'm sorry, sir, what bonds?"
"Oh, don't get fresh with me, boy."
"You see, we found Tony Mendoza's car, and his GPS was all jacked up."
But hell if the techs still didn't still find that he was parked at your house the night he went missing.
So I got curious.
Turns out you borrowed four million dollars in bearer bonds from FBI Evidence.
"A federal offense, by the by."
So where the hell are those bonds?
"Okay, wait, you think I killed Tony?"
"And yet you come out here, all alone?"
Artie would've told us.
Let's go.
"Uh, go--go--go back."
Go back.
Go back.
What--what exactly happened there?
"You tell us, Artie, okay?"
Because the Japanese sure as hell don't know.
They're testing for everything from dirty bombs to gas leaks.
They won't let us in the room.
They're holding us in the lobby.
They're--they're treating us like suspects.
Suspects?
Why?
did you have the decoy sword with you?
"No. but they're not even looking for the sword, Artie."
They--they're not even sure whether or not it was taken.
"Okay, that makes no sense to me whatsoever."
Either it's gone or it's not gone.
You said you saw somebody leaving.
Did he have it?
"I don't know, okay?"
'cause I was about two seconds away from passing out.
"Yeah, wh--wh--what did this guy look like?"
"Uh, not female."
"Look, Artie, uh, my Japanese sucks."
But it sounds to me as if they think the sword
Was vaporized or something.
What do you mean vaporized?
What do you mean?
By the bomb?
"There was no bomb, Artie."
Transfer the title to your mega-centre
We will make you neither a dead man nor a convict then.
A few our favors against one of yours.
"-These are good terms, agree to them!"
- No.
"Nod your head, if you don't want to piss blood until the end of your life."
- All right!
Good.
Go to the cell and have a rest.
Call for Seryozha and me when you're ready to go to the notary.
Is it a deal?
Don't!
Don't!
Get in!
Sit down.
I'm Petrovskiy Viktor Appolinarievich.
What is your name?
Korob.
Your first name?
- Igor Alexandrovitch.
- Igor Alexandrovitch.
Nice to meet you on our territory.
Damn it!
I didn't know that I would surrender so quickly!
Did you sign everything that they demanded?
You were right to do so.
They could have killed you.
"Listen to me, old man."
Life is more valuable than the money.
You'll earn it again.
You're still young.
"If you lose something you'll earn it back, if you are healthy."
"- That's a hint, by the way."
"- Colonel, I didn't mean..."
Pierce!
I've had it up to here with your forever putting the knock on the army!
The military has produced some great men...
"George Washington, Andy Jackson, Teddy Roosevelt."
"And if Klinger wants to re-up, I'll be proud to swear him in."
"- Thank you, sir."
"- Oh, no."
- After he's had some time to cool off.
- Thank you.
"- Oh, no."
"- Son, this is too big to rush into."
Take some time.
Think it through and through.
- You understand?
"- Yes, sir."
The colonel is very wise.
"This is a major step, and I shouldn't take it in the heat of passion."
Smart lad.
I'll be in here when and if you're ready.
Now get going and start thinking.
- Colonel...
"- Pierce, you just get going."
"Now, look, I want you to go sort this out."
I'll keep doing your work so you can give it your full concentration.
"Thank you, sir."
I'm gonna sort real hard.
- [Potter] Come in.
"- Sir, I thought it out."
"Well, I must say you have a very nice leg up on your recovery."
"Gee, Doc, I don't know how to thank you."
"CSU's working to break the encryption, but it's gonna take time."
"Jerry, that's time we don't have."
"Come on, I mean, this girl's life is at stake."
"Well, unless you know of some computer genius who can do the work of an entire crime lab in half the time, we're out of luck."
"Actually,"
I know just the guy.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
"Here's your sunrise cocktail, sir."
Thank you.
Ah.
"Oh, please, God, if you exist, prove it to me right here and now."
(quietly):
Thank you.

"Hi, excuse me, um, is that you on the cover of that magazine?"
"Oh, boy, that's so embarrassing."
My publicist insisted that I do it.
My name's Adam.
My friends call me Toast.
Mia.
I should probably know who you are.
Not unless you're a gamer.
"Yeah, I created one of the fastest grossing mobile games of all time."
We hit ten million downloads in the first month.
"Oh, wow, that's incredible."
That's what Tim Cook said.
"But enough about me, what is it that you do?"
"Um, I'm a model."
I was just in Lanai doing a swimwear shoot.
Ah.
"Swimwear, very cool."
- Sorry for the trouble.
Goodbye.
Business is slow too...
Do you think you'll have to go to the police station again?
Business has its ups and downs.
And so what if I go to the police station again?
I'm close to the officers there.
Are you not worried at all?
After Park Seon Woo is finished with Detective Im...
He could try to choke you next.
"If we fight, I'll win."
How are you joking around right now?
I'm worried to death over here...
"Smile, Writer Bae."
"They say, ""If you can't avoid it, enjoy it."""
Mr. President.
Do you know how much of an optimist you are?
That's the only way to deal with this situation.
"We will win, no matter what."
We will... win no matter what?
"By the way, did you start editing your script?"
"Yes, I started by changing the main character."
How?
He's not a superhero anymore.
He's someone who could leave if he wanted to...
But he's staying behind to help his neighborhood.
A typical... former secret agent.
What?
- Hello.
"- Oh, hi."
"Oh, Chan Gyu!"
- Do you work here?
"please, calm down."
"But this is still an advanced, liberal society, as far as I know."
"The police aren,t standing behind me, so I can say -"
"Let him talk, BonaIoi."
You see?
Stop it!
"Watch out, or I,II hit you!"
"Don,t try that again!"
"You,re all brawn, no brain!"
Stop it!
Bastard!
"Okay, okay."
I lost my temper.
Thanks.
I noticed.
"I,m sorry."
"Oh, don,t start whining!"
I was mad.
"I didn,t mean it."
Did I hurt you?
Come on.
"I,d like to thank our guests."
"Good night, viewers."

"It,s been confirmed that general Pinochet remains in critical condition."
"His family is with him, and we hope to have better news soon."
"Our model couple has now been ,in orbit, and under constant surveillance for three weeks."
No ill effects to report.
Quite the opposite.
"However, the City of the Future has hit some snags."
The project has stirred up local opposition:

Hello?
As a citizen
"I would like to say that I think it's odd that both the Mayor and Heather Weather were murdered, and don't you think that the true murderer is still out there?"
"Yeah, yeah."
You got any information for us?
"Well, I have plenty."
"I mean, have you checked out the drifter staying at the no tell motel."
And there's plenty of other suspects.
I'm having trouble understanding you.
Sounds like there's a cloth between your mouth and the phone.
"No, of course not."
"Well, you don't have to be nervous."
This is a totally anonymous service...
I just need to know one thing:
What size are you?
An xxxxxl.
Why?
So we can send you a tipster t-shirt.
"Wait a second, xxxxl?"
Is this Ricky?
Hm?
Oh.
Happy- Hold it.
No time.
We got a tip.

"And, His Excellency Li Hung-chang said, if you can free Ho Foon from charges, you'll become a hero."
Money and fame will come sooner or later.

"The chairs are not enough for all of us, you know?"
What's wrong with it?
What's wrong?
Where did you cut it?
You tried not to waste my time?
You think I'll be happy?
And that's being nice to me?
"You know, you wasted 3 good years."
We may not be together forever.
But we'll have happy memories.
We don't even have that now.

It won't be for very long.

How the hell did you lose an election?
No.
"The question is, how did you get to be in charge in New Bern?"
They get tired of you being the sheriff?
Can we buy some more of these things?
"Ten wind turbines for,let's say, ten percent of your spring crop."
"Okay, we'll give you the food."
All right.
- Doc Swain.
- Hi.
"Evening, Selena."
Be right with you.
My wife loved these flower gardens.
I try to keep them up for her.
Watch your feet.
Are you gonna tell them about me?
"- I'll have to, Selena."
- Nobody in town must ever know.
"- But if I don't, you'll be risking your life."
- I know that.
"- Well, then why?"
- Because of Ted.
"What are you afraid of, what he'll think?"
He loves you.
"It would ruin his life, married to a girl who... ."
Not a respectable person in town would accept him.
"""Respectable. "" What kind of respectability are you talking about?"
The people with enough money to hire him as a lawyer.
"Look, don't you understand?"
We're talking about your whole life.
Prison can be a kind of dying.
Losing Ted would be a worse kind of dying.
"- Besides, you mustn't get involved."
- Never mind about me.
Promise me you won't tell them.
"Promise me, please promise!"
"All right, Selena."
I'll promise you.
You don't seem to realize you face a possible life sentence.
They love playing  tricks on us.

We want a sea of orange in the Ziggo arena tonight.
Amsterdam.
We're going orange.
Orange face paint.
Orange clothes.
Orange and only orange.
Let's do it.
So Harry are you going to wear orange then
"Can't tell you, it's a surprise."
've seen a few fans outside with orange on.
I don't know if there's gonna be loads but I'm hoping there will be.
"Good evening, Amsterdam!"
"Ready, steady clap."
Everybody clap your hands.
People enjoying themselves.
Helps me get to sleep.
"They're Colombians, I think."
"So what happens now, Calum?"
About what?
I'm sorry
- I forget you need a bit of extra help.
Remember yesterday?
I was dragged here from prison late at night?
- You were nearly garrotted?
"- Oh, that."
- He wouldn't have gone through with it.
"- Just a kinky game, was it?"
Yeah.
"I'm a bit worried he likes me too much, actually."
"And so when are they gonna turn up again, Calum?"
"Oh, don't worry."
Lenny'll be back soon.
"And that's what he does, by the way - turns up."
"Doesn't always knock, either."
So make sure you're not washing up naked.
"You'll be wanting to see your sister, I expect."
"You've not even met your niece yet, have you?"
- Is that allowed?
- Course it is.
"You're not on the run, licence is in order."
Go ahead.
Go see Jess and the kids.
I'm not a control freak.
"This is where you really want me to live, is it?"
You wouldn't want to live here - too many ghosts.
Door.

"I'm so sorry, Chip."
What you thinkin' about?
Oh.
"I was thinkin' when I was young,"
I couldn't wait to move out and start my own life.
I thought I'd be an actress or a successful business woman.
"And then I told myself when the boys got out of the house, and started their lives, that I'd do the same thing."
And then I thought Dale had it together.
But he didn't.
He's starting over.
"And, well, Chip. [Chuckles]"
"I help them, I wait for them, and for what?"
My life gets lost in the shuffle.
I don't think this time
I'm gonna be able to forgive them.

Be quiet.
What's a jammer?

Son of a bitch.
All right.
Now he said that the two of you we're trying to rob him.
Is that true?
- No.
- Yes.
"Officer, yes, it's true."
"We broke into his house to rob him, okay, but, he's been keeping us against our will, underground in a torture den."
An underground torture den?
There's a secret door.
If you look inside...
Secret door?
"In the basement, a secret..."

The two of you were trying to rob the house of some kind of serial killer?

Went to sleep in my mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on.
You didn't die?
"Freakin' hybrids, man."
They just don't do the trick anymore.
"All right, kids in seats, kids in seats."
Today we are going to discuss the Berlin Wall.
This was the wall in Germany that actually separated the communist east side and democratic west side.
"East side, west side, whatever side you're on as long as we care about each other we can still have some fun"
"Oh, man."
[singing]
"Oh, good kids."
God!
This's sucks!
"Do you feel like maybe you l-l-loosing her, S-Stan?"
I don't know.
There's nothing I can do about it anyway.
Maybe you should just talk to her.
"You know, a little conversation."
Tell her what you feel.
"Sometimes you feel like there's a b-burning in sky, do you like--"
Stop!
And a little bit of spit.
Kidding.
Testing.
Sorry.
"You have the Tesla, right?"
I'll trade you for the Farnsworth.
- But you have the gun.
"- I know, but it's the boring one."
"- Well, you lost the toss."
- I know.
Let's just go find this artifact and see if we can't change somebody's luck.
That thing is so freaky.
"- What, this?"
"- No, the thing behind you."
"Yeah, that."
"Well, trapped desires..."
"Refracted by light, sound, sex..."
Mind-altering drugs into a...
- Disco ball.
- Disco ball.
- A disco ball.
- I know.
"- Dude, how?"
"- Well, unknown."
"Unknown, but, mirrors are usually just gonna reflect light, but this thing projects yearnings and cravings."
You know what this thing does?
It imparts a grim stampeding inhumanity against anything decent.
You asked.
Don't worry.
"No, not in here."
"In here it's just a round, shiny object."
- But out there...
Anything you care to share with me?
Sure.
Your commercials?
They suck ass.
I've seen better acting in an epileptic whorehouse.
Is that like the one your mom works at?
Is she still offering the two-for-one discount?
"DEA, huh?"
For a street bust.
"Now, what would two feds want with that little twerp?"
"Sooner or later, this was gonna happen."
"You want your exponential growth, guys are gonna get busted."
Simple as that.
So how about we get him a real attorney?
"I mean, what the hell is this?"
This is who he hires?
What?
Are you kidding me?
This is the guy you want.
This is the guy I'd hire.
- It's the guy you'd hire.
"- Look, you remember Emilio?"
"This dude got Emilio off, like, twice."
"Both times, they had him dead to rights, yo."
And then poof!
Dude's like Houdini.
"Seriously, when the going gets tough, you don't want a criminal lawyer."
All right?
"You want a ""criminal"" lawyer."
Know what I'm saying?
"Look, we're in good shape, Mr. White."
Badger's way too loyal to roll.
See?
That was easy.
"It's like I always say, when it comes to good parenting, you have to be fair but firm."
You just show 'em that you mean business...
"And he's out of bed again, isn't he?"
You never have this problem with sock puppets.
"All right, what's this all about?"
Voices.
- Voices?
- In here.
Telling me what to do.
You have voices inside your head.
Sometimes.
And what kind of things do they tell you to do?
The early bird catches the worms!
What's gotten into this kid?
Hey!
You're going to...
Maybe you sing him a little song.
"Come here, you..."
Hey!
What the...?
Do I look like the kind of guy that knows a lullaby?
Sing!
Lullaby and good night
Close your big creepy eyes
If you sleep Away I'll creep
And get out of here alive
"You know, once you get past all the splinters and rope burns, he's actually kind of cute."
Now where did he go?
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
Now there's something you don't see every day.
"Oh, yeah?"
I am gonna punch a hole through your face.
I'd like to see you try that.
Yeah?
"- Ooh, you're gonna die!"
"- Oh, I am gonna rip your face off..."
- You're gonna die!
"- Make a shirt out of it, and I'm gonna wear it."
"I'm gonna take one second to take my shirt off, and then you're gonna die!"
What the...
"Hey, listen, lady."
"You wanna beat up on your little boyfriend, you go do it somewhere else."
Watch the car.
"- Dude, where the hell is your fighter?"
- He'll be here.
- He'll be here when?
- Soon!
"- Okay, you have five minutes to put a fighter in that ring."
- Okay.
Just got off the phone with Charlie.
"- Well, where is he?"
- He's in jail with Dee.
- What?
- Apparently they got all hopped up on amphetamines... and beat the shit out of some guy in front of the bar.
- Amphetamines?
"- Yeah, like, steroids or something."
I don't know.
"- Damn it, Charlie."
- Look at the dude he was supposed to fight.
- He's the scrawniest...
- I know!
Charlie would have killed that guy.
DuBois.
DuBois.
It's a French name.
"It means ""woods,"" and blanche means ""white""  so the two together mean ""white woods""  like an orchard in spring."
You can remember it by that if you care to.
"You are stella's sister, are you not?"
Yes.
stella is my precious little sister.
I call her little in spite of the fact that she's somewhat older than I am.
"Oh, just slightly."
Less than a year.
will you do something for me?
Sure.
"Yes, what?"
I bought this adorable little paper lantern at a Chinese shop on Bourbon.
Put it over the light bulb.
"will you, please?"
I'd be glad to.
I can't stand a naked light bulb any more than I can a rude remark or a vulgar action.
"well, I guess we strike you as being a pretty rough bunch."
I'm very adaptable to circumstances.
"well, that's a good way to be."
-You're not--?
-Married?
"Oh, no."
"No, I'm an old maid schoolteacher."
"You may be a schoolteacher, but you're certainly not an old maid."
"Why, thank you, sir."
I appreciate your gallantry.
So you're in the teaching profession.
Yes.
-Yes.
Are they farts or are they queefs?
Do you know what I mean?
This is the problem.
A front bottom one.
"I often think it's easier to say it's queef than a fart, because..."
I've never heard queef.
I'm enjoying queef.
I know.
A fanny fart.
"Yeah, but queef, what's that mean?"
I don't know where that came from.
It's an American word.
"Yeah, it is."
It's a pussy fart.
"Well, thanks for clearing that up."
When your cat farts.
Exactly!
"I don't think a man's as put off by a pussy fart, because they just think it's funny and it's often the result of something good happening."
"Whereas if you just let rip, a man's not going to go,"
"""I'm going to marry you for that revolting smell you just made."""
"Queef I think could be onomatopoeic, as in it's the sound it makes."
Queef!
"If you did willy farts, men would never stop doing willy farts."
"Oh, my God, it would be..."
Can you imagine it?
Especially if it made a whistling sound.
The joy that spread over your faces just thinking about that!
"If we could do willy farts, I would do one right here on this show."
"It should be like old Victorian policemen, you know."
Feep!
Feep!
"It's like a call - ""I need help'!"" Feep!"
Now we're even.
"So long, Stacey."
"Come on, you."
On your feet.
"Honest, Stacey, honest."
It wasn't my fault.
I told ya I didn't want anybody killed.
Get moving.
Where you taking me?
"You didn't think I was gonna let you live and welsh on that confession, did ya?"
"No, no."
Let me alone!
Let me alone!
"Please, Stacey, please!"
[GUNFIRE]
[¶¶¶]
[¶¶¶]
"So long, old-timer."
"I guess if you hadn't socked me on the chin,"
"I'd be laying in the icehouse now, along with Dale and the rest."
I-
"- Gee, I don't know what to say."
"Never mind, Red."
You'll be out yourself before long.
Thanks.
"So long, Frank."
"It oughta make up for what you've gone through in here,"
"Ross, to know that it hasn't been in vain."
"The day Stacey came to me and gave himself up,"
I asked him why he was throwing away his freedom.
"I didn't fully understand all he tried to tell me, but it was something about you living the rest of your life for him as he might have lived it himself if he'd had the right breaks when he was a kid."
Then he asked me for a photograph of himself.
Widowed for 10 years.
Her husband was AIban Lajeunesse.
"After he died, she sold her land, and kept the house..."
like a Iot of people around here...
"like me, too."
What happened?
"I was coming home from a date, happy, it had gone well between us."
It was exactly 1 :15.
"I slowed down in front of C,duIie's, all the lights were on outside."
"I saw polo, in his PJs, alone in the yard."
"I got out and I saw C,duIie with the gun."
"And then I saw the black guy, with eyes big as saucers."
"He came on his bike, but why come here?"
And why the gun?
"I asked C,duIie: "" What's going on?"""
What's going on is...
"what's going on... it's... that, there."
"...she said, showing her broken little plaster negro."
Then I understood what was going on.
"The statue was beyond repair, even for Crazy glue."
I Iooked at the kid and asked:
What got into you?
"Him, not a word."
He didn't seem to understand me.
So she told me:
Maybe he thinks it's ugly.
"That happens sometimes, huh?"
We don't all have the same taste.
"No, but you still got to be pretty shameless."
And he was shameless.
He didn't look at all ashamed.
"I took the gun from her, but she defended him and said:"
- So the Starling sisters lied?
What difference does it really make?
"For God's sake, of course it makes a difference."
It's not the truth.
"The truth is, they stole a boat from a man who terrified them and set out to cross 50 miles of open sea into a war."
- They never got there.
- Because their engine failed.
"Now, there's a truth we won't be telling."
"Morale-sapping, apparently."
We pick our truths.
Isn't that the point?
We're saying this is based on a true story.
Then don't.
"Oh, Christ above, man, you're supposed to be the propagandist!"
700 ships went to Dunkirk.
"338,000 men came back."
Don't say it's based on a true story.
Say it's based on 100 true stories.
- A thousand.
"- 338,000."
"Dunkirk, the biggest retreat in military history, or the miracle that put the fire back in all our bellies?"
"Very well, carry on as you were."
I have a car waiting.
You won't regret it.
"Thank you, Mr. Swain."
Buckley!
Buckley!
Sit.
Sit.
I don't care that you lied.
I care that you lied to us.
There wasn't enough money.
I have a pair of cargos that come with a ski cap.
"- Just some long pants, if you got those."
- Yeah.
Sure.
Like drop-crotch slacks?
Just the best-- whatever.
It doesn't... [coffeemaker gurgling]
Pants!
- Thanks.
"- So, what's the what, man?"
"Yeah, like I was saying, I just, you know--"
"It's the first time I've been back in the 'hood in a minute and it kind of... you know, to be honest, it feels like people are... trying to hold me responsible for something I did."
"Man, that is unfair."
"But, I mean, that's like, just like a people, isn't it?"
"Like, they do that."
"Yeah, they do."
"And, you know, I'm just..."
I really just need somewhere to-- somewhere to stay.
"Oh, man."
You should talk to my landlord.
"- Man, he's the most accommodating dude."
- Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"He's always telling me he's got like, a line of people that he wants to get in here."
"You should get on line, Chip!"
He is a real coolio too.
"Like, I haven't paid rent in like, three or six different months."
"So, I mean, that's one thing."
"But, you should hurry, because he said that rents are gonna skyrocket soon because of the new hotel going."
So--
Shit!
"Hey, Sefton, what's snarling up the traffic?"
"By the time we get to look, they'll be old hags."
"Simmer down, boys, simmer down."
There'll be a second show when they put the next batch through.
"Hey, Sefton."
What's the big idea?
Take that telescope out of here.
- Says who?
-Says me.
You take it out.
Only you're gonna have a riot on your hands.
"Every time the men get packages, you think up some angle to rob them."
"The Krauts find that, they'll throw us in the boob."
They know about that.
I'd worry about that radio.
They know about your distillery and the races.
That's right.
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
Ask Security.
Go on.
Tell him.
You've got me shadowed every minute.
- Haven't you found out?
-Not yet.
Answer.
How do you rate all these privileges?
I grease the guards.
I give them 10 percent.
And maybe a little something else.
- What?
-Maybe a little information.
Break it off!
I'd like to know what made him do it.
Maybe he just wanted to steal our wire cutters.
You ever think of that?
Next man.
"Right, you'll do."
"When faced by an armed and determined enemy, first you..."
And either you bash him one or you stick him in the belly.
"If you want to be real nasty, you?"
Tread on his blank blank fingers.
Right!
Next man.
You'll do.
- Let's try that again.
"You've had your treat, let someone else have fun."
"Proper airborne, weren't you, Canada?"
"Didn't you hear me, Evans?"
"What about the other boys, Sarge?"
I don't want to be too selfish.
Come on.
Right.
"When faced by an armed and determined enemy, first you..."
Either you bash him one or you stick him in the belly.
"If you want to be real nasty, you?"
"If you want to be real nasty, you?"
Right!
Gordon.
"He's leaving himself wide open, watch."
"I am, am I?"
Come on.
"When faced by an armed and determined enemy, first you..."
Argh!
That's a sign.
He's so thoughtful!
I'm smitten.
I can tell!
You look green!
Is that your heart broken to cut chips?
Somebody gets a Pepto!
Spritzer girl?
Where is the art department?
Things should be clearly marked in these offices.
- It's down there.
- I'm supposed to meet Sebastian.
We're going to discuss strategies for covering up heroine tracks.
"It's so, so sad!"
I know.
It's terrible that these girls do that to themselves.
"It causes so much extra work for us, matching skin tones... blending palletes."
For arms can be quite difficult for artists.
"I can imagine, good luck!"
"My God, you're sick!"
I think I got a full poisoning atrophy.
I'm so sorry.
I'm horrified!
I didn't want you to see me like this.
"Don't worry, it happens to everyone."
I'll get some water.
"Honey, are you all right?"
You got it all dripping!
I just chugged in front of Paul.
I'm gonna kill myself.
"Don't worry, you'll lose weight."
Here he comes Remember:
You're not OK with Kat and Christian.
You're still angry.
Since when had being gay defined me?
I kind of lied before.
I do like the neurotic ones.

"Go, go, go!"
What is going on out here?
!
None of you are going to sleep until your side is spotless.
But the first-years ambushed us!
No excuses!
"And you two, don't even pretend that you've been fishing."
"Oh, um..."
"In that case, you have broken curfew."
"Put that down, pick up a mop!"
Another strike?
There'll be more.
We're one step ahead.
Particularly concerning ballet.
We would thrash you any day.
Are you threatening a ballet battle?
There's no such thing.
A hip-hop war.
Second-year crew versus the ballet tragics.
"Saturday afternoon, 12:45 at the cafe."
We're done here.
Let's bounce.
"They're well oiled, I'll give them that much."
"Oh, sorry."
How is it possible you slept through that?
Let me guess
- How do you know?
- I know because Stacy Culpepper's got one.
And everybody was talking about it.
Let's get ours.
- We can't.
- Why not?
Because we blew the money on rent again.
"Still, we might still have enough for just one dress and then maybe..."
What?
"Again, Vi?"
Call Russ back before he gives the job away.
- We got it.
- What...
"He said it was an easy gig, right?"
- Yea.
"- Up the money too, didn't he?"
Yea.
Then what are we waiting for?
That's shit!
"Hey Russ, it's me Daisy."
I know what we said.
"but, we've changed our mind and we thought... we considered your offer."
"And we think, that actually it'd work out quite well because um..."
"See, the day that you talked about..."
"Deeper baby, deeper..."
"Ow, gross!"
You weren't suppose to like it!
"Like I've end up better do with it, Princess."
Are you guys hear about this guy?
"Ok so basically, there was this guy who stole some shit from Chet."
- What did this guy take from him?
- A truck full of cologne.
Alright mate?
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks you alright?
Got you a gift.
It's still in the shop.
Oh man that's perfect!
'Coz I can just collect it when I get yours next month.
No Laura?
"No, no, she had a work-thing and couldn't shift things around."
Couldn't shift things around?
"I'm not 6, Slade."
I'm only doing this for my mum.
Have you heard from Danny?
"No, has he not called?"
Maybe he couldn't shift things around.
"Hello, I'd just like to say a few words."
"You know it's a celebratory moment for a father when you look at your son, your baby, and you realize that he's reached the age where he can no longer call himself young."
"Because if he is becoming an old fart, then where does that leave me?"
A gravedodger?
"So I'd like you all please, to raise a glass."
- Ignore his crows-feet and his receding hairline.
- Thanks mate.
"And wish a happy birthday, to my little boy."
To Mark.
Happy Birthday!
"Sorry, sorry..."
I wanted to say something too.
"As you all know, we've had some difficult times in the past."
I have two sons.
Mark... and Jesse.
Hey mom...
But only one of them is here every year on his birthday.
"Give me $200 each, for your own protection."
And I'll forget the insult.
You young punks have to learn to respect a man like me!
Otherwise the cops will come to your house.
And your family will be ruined.
Of course if I'm wrong about how much you stole
- I'll take a little less.
"And by less, I only mean - a hundred bucks less."
Now don't refuse me.
"Understand, paisan?"
I understand.
My friends and I share all the money.
"So first, I have to talk to them."
Tell your friends I don't want a lot.
Just enough to wet my beak.
Don't be afraid to tell them!
600 bucks...
Suppose we don't pay?
"You know his gang, Tessio."
Real animals.
Maranzalla himself let Fanucci work this neighborhood.
"He's got connections with the cops, too."
We have to pay him.
$200 each...everybody agreed?
Why do we have to pay him?
"Vito, leave this to us."
"He's one person, we're three."
"He's got guns, we've got guns."
Why should we give him the money we sweated for?
This is his neighborhood!
I know two bookies who don't give anything to Fanucci.
Who?
I'm still your mother.
"No, my mother's dead."
I went to her funeral when I was six.
And she wasn't trying to reconnect with me.
"She was trying to use me, like you are now."
Why?
She wants an army.
An army?
I want an alliance.
"No, what you want is revenge."
- This isn't about me.
-(SCOFFS)
It's about putting an end to a system that says one group is more deserving than another.
"This city may be surrounded by a wall, but it doesn't have to be a prison."
- I think that's a bit extreme.
-Hmm?
"I mean, the Faction System isn't perfect, but it's hardly a prison."
Let me guess.
Erudite.
I was Erudite.
You willing to kill Jeanine?
Absolutely.
"When I was married to Marcus, I knew her well."
"And believe me, there's nothing she isn't capable of."
But I think you already know that.
"Tris, we can't trust her."
Or maybe she knows...
"We're on the same side, Tris."
I'm Factionless because I don't fit into any one faction.
And you're Divergent because you belong to too many.
But we're both a threat to Jeanine.
"My people are ready for war, if that's what it takes."
"- Oh, yes, of course."
"- Excuse us, darling."
- Sure.
"Dexter, I haven't said it before."
I will now.
I think your courage was admirable.
And I have you to thank for saving my father's life.
"Now, I realise the great risks you took, and I'll always appreciate it."
"I'm glad I was able to help, Michael."
And that we all got back safely.
"Well, there is one more favour I'd like to ask of you."
That being?
"From now on, stay away from my wife."
Michael.
"Look, whatever you're thinking-"
My suspicions are groundless?
- Yes.
- Good.
Then it will make it that much easier for you.
You know something?
This conversation is for the royal birds.
If you'll excuse me.
"Michael, why did you do that?"
"Oh, my God, Amanda, isn't it obvious?"
"No, it isn't obvious to me."
"Well, how do you think I feel when you throw your arms around?"
"Prince Michael, I have some good news."
Your father has regained consciousness for the first time.
- You may see him for a few moments.
- Thank you.
I'll see him alone.
Michael.
"So, he must be around them."
Who is the new entrant in their family?
He is my friend Kalyan.
He can't be the thief.
He is memory loss patient.
I'm at peace in this condition.
Something is wrong.
Thanks partner.
How are you?
Who is your partner!
Do you know where will I be tomorrow?
How many people are so honest in their duty like your son?
Catch me before December 16.
You will catch him for sure.
You are his right partner.
You are my right partner.
"What do you say, Swami?"
"First, let's have tea."
"Later, we can deal with the money."
Thief...!
Money is more important to me.
"Yes, my son is a thief."
He became a thief for kick.
"He was in search of kick, but he didn't get it."
But it came looking for him.
We are Venkat  Swapna.
We have a daughter.
I work in a private company.
My salary is Rs.10000.
"Every morning at 8, I take the lunch box, drop my daughter at the school, catch a running bus, go to office, come back in the evening, play with my daughter,"
"sometimes go to theatre, count our savings several times and feel safe, this is my life."
We've no complaints on anyone.
That made me so happy.
"I was really, really happy."
That's why I'm here right now.
The Adventures of Hero Masamune Congrats on the Completion!
I wonder if that person still reads my novels today.
The Adventures of Hero Masamune Congrats on the Completion!
"I see, so Izumi-sensei, you too..."
"""Sensei""?"
"Oh, n-nothing!"
I knew you wrote novels on the web!
I-I see.
But to think I'd see the day where I could talk to you like this.
"Big Brother, why are you bothering me?"
You should just leave me alone.
I'm just...
Do I trouble you?
T-Trouble...
It's because you're my little sister.
And Mom asked me to take good care of you.
Is that your reason?
I still don't know what counts as taking good care of you.
So I just do things that I feel would count as such.
I don't get it at all.
"Other than that, I'm just lonely, after all."
I'd like to eat meals together with my cute little sister.
"And I want to take care of her, too."
"Even a troublesome little sister like this, who hardly ever talks to you?"
So you were aware of that.
I want us to get along.
Because we're family.
Are we a family?
Of course.
They were born when I lived in Florida with Bram.
"Don't you know Bram, my husband?"
-No.
You helped him go into hiding.
His name was Henk Meyer then.
1m90 and skinny as a rake.
I really don't remember him.
He was always hungry but he still gave me his distribution coupons.
There were so many.
He looked me up straight after the war.
Then we got married.
He'd be kicking me at least once a week during the night.
He'd have nightmares about Krauts and camps.
"When the Cold War started with Berlin and the Russians, it got really bad."
He kicked me out of the bed every night.
"Without being aware of it, the darling."
So we went to America.
"At least, there was an ocean in between."
"Yes, I heard you left the country."
"When the children were adults, they went to Israel."
We didn't.
"But we did come back, so we're halfway now."
"Nowhere at home, but still happy."
Very happy.
"No other news, and you?"
Do you ever think of Arie?
Arie...
It's easy to idealize.
-Would you have been happier?
I am happy.
But Arie's no longer there.
"On Remembrance Day, I sometimes think of what guys like Arie missed out on... after the war."
- Whoa!
Whoo!
Drink this.
Drink this.
"Now, just to be clear, these aren't steroids, right?"
"No, no, no, no."
Of course not.
These are performance-enhancing supplements.
"Okay, so how long before I start to notice something?"
This is the good stuff.
You'll feel it almost immediately.
"But I should warn you, you may experience some mood swings... some irrational thinking here and there... but it is nothing compared to the long-term effects."
- Which are what?
- You ever punched a guy so hard in the eye he swallowed it?
I'll get some water.
"- How you feel, man?"
You drunk?
- Yeah.
I'm pretty wasted.
- Great.
So what do we smash first?
- I wanna smash a crate.
"- Yeah, a crate on his back."
- Why don't you punch me?
- Punch you?
Punch you?
- What?
"I'm probably gonna get punched a lot in the tournament, right?"
- Yeah.
All right.
"- Okay, that's a good point."
- Let's punch him.
That's because he stepped in with the c-block.
Pete stepped in because Adam was too much of a wussy to talk to Kim himself!
- Ahem.
- We'll be right with you.
"Yeah, you guys good?"
Want a soda or anything?
Grayson:
No?
Great.
Why am I the only one looking out for Kim here?
"She wants tall, cool Pete, not lame, weird Adam."
You don't know the first thing about Adam!
You don't know the first thing about Pete!
"Hey, guys, do you like role-playing games and stories with dragons?"
"Get out of here now, please!"
Run for your lives!
"I'm hosting a trunk sale outside-- cigarettes, bad lite beer, and urine samples so clean you'd swear it was from the math club."
Parking lot. 10 minutes.
I think I'm having an asthma attack.
Leave now if you value your pants.
Just go.
Go.
"Dude, the cops are coming to..."
[ Inhales sharply ]
I can't lie to you.
Let's just... get in your car and see where the night takes us.
"Laurie, you're nothing like your mom"
- and you never will be.
- [ Sighs deeply ]
Where is your baby right now?
He's at home with a sitter.
"Where would Baby Laurie have been if her mother was out at a bar, partying?"
What'II happen if we call the cops?
"Touchy disagreed, he said:"
They'II talk to him and force him to buy a new one.
I can buy another one.
That's not the point.
He did something illegal.
Since when do you care about what's legal.
"And I suppose you drank milk at the hotel, so you could drive back?"
We drank milk... 0.08% .
The kind of milk Ducky could lose his license for.
And not you?
"I can't lose mine, I already lost it."
No... that's a joke...
he still has his license.
"Everybody was laughing, except... except the neg..."
"black kid, and Ducky convinced her about the police."
It's like drinking and driving.
"You don't get caught, you're OK."
"He got caught, he's gotta pay."
It's our duty as citizens.
What if he smashes all the little statues around?
"If we let him go, he might go and do a massacre at Gagnon's Nursery."
We'II feel guilty... our whole lives.
"They won't hang him, they'II just... give him a ticket."
alright!
"You want to do it, you deal with it."
"Bertrand, you know where the phone is."
I'm going to bed.
Come polo sweetheart.
We'II go beddy-byes.
Come with mommy.
She took polo by the arm and...
Seeing them.
No.
They never seem to stay dead.
How's it going over there?
"There's stuff on here, but it's password protected."
"I know, but can you open it?"
I don't know. I'm trying.
(sighs) How do we know all this mayhem hasn't already happened?
We don't.
Good.
Just keep working.
Fuck.
(sighs)
Can you just talk to me?
"Yeah, what do you wanna talk about?"
Anything.
Just regular stuff.
Like what normal people talk about.
"-Not really my strong suit, Katherine."
-l'll start.
(sighs)
How do you know I dropped out of college?
"Oh, that was just a lucky guess."
Grabbed my file or something?
-You fit a profile.
-Of what?
"Civilian broadcasters have a certain, you know, personality trait."
Keep working.
"Well, I can't work in silence, so you might as well just entertain me."
Okay.
A troubled childhood with an emphasis on extreme emotional loss or fatigue.
Death of a parent.
"Mr. Brubaker, I assure you that my father is innocent."
"I... no, he's not in the office, but..."
I'll have him call you.
- I am so happy to see you.
"- Guess who no longer works for Partridge, Savage and Cann?"
- You quit?
- Or got fired.
Quit slash got fired.
Lot of things were said.
- None of them good.
- What happened?
Your father.
"They said as long as I was representing him, I wasn't working for them."
It's Thursday night.
No knocking until 9:00 p. m.
Cohen!
How did you get in here?
"Your stepmom, who's in unusually good spirits."
- It's the Klonopin.
- That'd explain that eye twitch.
"- Listen, I'm not going to stay long."
"- Actually, you can't stay at all."
"The Valley is on, so you should just..."
"Right, no, I have something for you."
"- Well, unless it's a plutonium -fueled car to take me back to last year so I can never date you, I'm not interested."
"- Oh, okay, it's two tickets to The Walkmen tomorrow night."
"- I'm not going to a concert with you, ass."
"Hey, I'm not going, okay?"
"Well, I am, actually, I'm going, but I'm not going to go with you."
These are for you and Zach.
- Me and Zach?
- Yeah.

I think you're having an identity crisis.
It doesn't matter who you are.

Yes.
So a power ranger did this to my soldier?
The humans can fight back?
Yes.
"Apparently, yes."
"Well, I don't like that."
Take it easy.
Drive carefully.
"Alright, um..."
I'm not giving up on us.
You will.
"Just leave them on the, on the table."
Drive carefully everyone!
Thank God.
I thought they'd never leave.
Her grief runs deep.
I think Lindsay might be like a dam waiting to burst.
There is no right way to grieve.
And probably far more than five stages.
And the process itself is as complex as the people who experience it.
Especially if the loss is still a mystery.
Loaded with secrets.
"Um, your Dad's here."
Honestly... ..do I look fat on this?
"No, you, you look..."
Lovely.
As always.
"Thanks, Arlo."
You really have been so good to me.
I don't deserve it.
Of course you do.
"You know, I would do anything for someone going through this."
You know me and Jared used to get all these postcards from Mum at Christmas and birthdays.
"Yeah, I heard that."
We knew they were from Dad.
"'Cause he's got this really bad squiggly handwriting, but we pretended to go along with it just to make him feel better really."
It's kind of sweet.
In his own strange way I guess... ..he does love you.
"Isn't it, Laurie?"
"[ Drowners' ""A Button On Your Blouse"" playing ]"
How long have we been holding hands?
Huh.
Wasn't that fun?
[ Chuckles ]
Why don't you go spend some time with your friends now?
[ Gasps ] These kids are so happy.
They even gave me a nickname--
"""That lady who saved prom."" [ Laughs ]"
I even made a love connection.
"I found a lonely guy and a lonely girl,"
I put 'em together...
and now they're dancing.
It's a weird dance.
It's like they're trying to smother a fire between their crotch.
So what have you been doing since I lost you?
Gettin' crazy?
Yeah.
"No, I mean, I was."
But then I remembered that I left my purse over here so I came to find it.
That's the end of the story.
"Hey, it's early."
Let's go have some fun.
Go without me because I need to catch my breath after all the...
purse excitement.
No way!
We're a team!
"Also, you may have to rescue me in case anyone pulls me into a dance circle."
That is my biggest fear.
"Well, that and... [ Whispers ] clowns."
What about a dance circle made up of clowns?
About six years.
"You get some kind of sick pleasure from that, the boss' daughter?"
"""Boss""?"
I thought we were friends.
I love Mary.
And I think she loves me.
I want your desk cleaned out by tomorrow.
"After this is over, I'll be going back to Maine."
I don't wanna see you there when I go into the office.
How you feeling?
What's happening to me?
"- It's in her DNA, isn't it?"
- That's what makes her special.
Mum...
"I never believed that part of your story-- ""My grandfather was an alien."""
- Allie...
- Your dad--could he do things?
"I never saw it, but, yes, he could."
- But you never could.
- I can play drums and sing harmony.
A lot of people would tell you that's amazing.
There's you and me.
"The way I know where you are, how you're feeling, if you're safe."
I always figured that was just because I'm your only daughter and you love me so much.
"Yeah, I suppose it could be that."
"It's what made your dad sick, isn't it, doing these things?"
"You're not my dad, honey."
You've got a lot of other things in you.
"You've got Charlie's family, too."
MAN:
Everybody in position?
He's not gonna last much longer.
- Who are you?
- We?
We're the modest employees of our respected police.
I'm the Major and Seryozha is Captain.
- What are you incriminating me for?
- What words you know!
You'll tell us yourself what we're incriminating you for.
You have no right to...
Call her in.
Sergeant?
Bring the victim in.
Do you recognise this man?
I do.
- Did he rape you perversely?
- Yes he did.
Tell us about it.
What shall I tell you?
What shall I repeat it for?
I was standing on the road waiting for a ride to the city.
A foreign car stopped.The door was opened.
- And?
- A man offered to give me a lift.
"The man was decent-looking, in an expensive suit."
So I got in.
We passed a few kilometres.
Then he turned off the road and raped me.
That's all.
You may go free.
You'll sign the protocol of identification later.
She was your Statute 153 and a straight road to the rooster house.
In a blink of an eye a rusty shank will be stuck in your hemorrhoidal ass...
What do you want of me?
It's a meeting about having me replaced on the ticket.
I know how to count to 270.
"John, I assure you..."
"I assure you that if it were a serious notion, we would..."
- Texas is gone.
So is Florida.
- We're not doing it.
- You should think about it.
- Are you taking your name off that bill?
Nobody benefits from the Internet right now more than the rural poor.
You're taking your name off.
We can't campaign on it.
"- Yes, sir."
- And if somebody's attacking us you know what to do.
I call Leo.
"Yeah, but don't discount the possibility that it might be Leo."
"Yes, sir."
"John, despite this recent revelation that you drank beer in college I've always liked you a little more than you thought I did."
But that's not why you're staying.
It's this.
Four words.
I've always liked you more than you thought I did too.
"Just a little, right?"
"- Yes, sir."
- Me too.
Anything else?
"- Thank you, Mr. President."
"- Thank you, sir."
Charlie!
"- Yes, sir."
- Let's go.
I'm a magic man.
Daddy?
"Your dad has a broken pelvis, which are the ring of bones around his waist."
Some of his blood vessels have also been damaged.
He's bleeding inside.
Can you fix it?
"We're gonna try, but he's lost a lot of blood already."
It's very serious.
It was supposed to be me.
"I was supposed to go get the pizza, but I-I... didn't want to go out in the rain."
"It's not your fault, and it's not your dad's fault."
"Hey, jerk-off!"
I can't drive for a week.
Not that I could anyway-- my car is totaled.
What was so important you had to be talking on the phone while driving!
Come on!
What was so damn important!
Hey!
That's enough!
"- Hey, get that guy away from me!"
- Shut up!
.
"Jason, hey, I know you're mad, but your father's condition is very serious, and your brother and sister need you right now, okay?"
"Come on, Jason, I'll take you to the Family Room."
"Dr. Kovac, one of your patients is getting agitated."
- Which one?
T- he girl from the nursing home.
"- She's in a coma, Inez."
- Not anymore.
- Where...
- I'm Dr. Kovac.
Wh-Where's my mom?
"Okay, keep your hands up as if you were holding a tray."
Have you stuck with Jags?
"This is my fifth Jag, my fourth X Jag."
"You know, I'm 59 now."
"I deserve it, don't I?"
I've had a Jag for years.
I'm embarrassed.
I always wanted one.
"The first I got five years ago, I was so proud."
"One day, as a trustee of the Royal Armouries, a priceless collection of arms and armour..."
In Leeds.
"£45m building, the most secure one in Leeds."
"I had to get a parking pass from reception, so I roared up, outside the big glass doors of the armouries, nobody around, opened the door, engine running, and rushed in to get my pass."
I parked at the front as I'm a trustee - who's going to tell me off?
"I pushed this door round, and saw someone getting in to my car."
"I thought, ""They're terrific, the armouries."
"They're valet parking it for me. """
"""Fantastic. """
And then it roared off.
A Jaguar does do 0-60 in five seconds!
"Whoosh, it was gone."
It was nicked?
It was nicked.
Did you ever get it back?
I got it back about ten days later.
It was OK.
They'd used the ashtrays...
"Oh, no."
"And they'd retuned the radio from Radio 4, so I was a bit annoyed."
"Anyway, I did get it back and it was OK."
"But a year later,"
"I went on a charity visit to Armley Jail in Leeds, we were being shown round and they echo, these prisons, have you been in one?"
Yeah.
Tell her I'm pleased about her and the plumber.
It's handy to have a man with a trade about the house.
She deserves a bit of happiness.
"I know I was never the father you needed or deserved, but you will always be my beautiful girl  and I will always love you."
Always... always... always.
He still had six weeks in solitary.
"If people don't respect the law, what have you got?"
"Anarchy, mob rule, and mice in your garibaldis."
What are you going on about?
You think his mouse brothers come and busted him out?
Mind you...
I think I can see a tunnel.
Ooh...
Back already?
Ahh... there's your culprit.
- A bleeding' heart liberal like Paul.
- What?
"Yeah, that's it."
"He's got the hump about that three-and-out thing, and he's come down here and he's let Mickey have it away on his toes."
"That's your man, Victor."
He even looks guilty.
It was a joke.
We were having a laugh.
What you talking about?
You know.
"The rule, the big game, three and out."
- What about it?
- You know what?
I think he believed us.
"You knew it was a joke... a wind-up, didn't you?"
What?
You actually fell for it?
Getting Scott to sell the bar wasn't going so well.
This place has been in my familyfor 112 years.
I promised by grandfather I'd come back and run it.
"So, the huge deal my dad had worked on for a year fell through."
I'm not going to repeat what he's saying there.
Let's just say my dad pretty much hates Scott.
But I kind of like him.
Enough to sneak out of work to do this.
"I got to tell you, you turned out to be a pretty good motorcycle passenger."
"Well, it involves two skills I'm good at-- sitting and not dying."
"Come on, give yourself more credit than that."
"You leaned with the turns, you didn't put your hands over my eyes and shout ""Guess who?"""
Just that once.
I got a little bored when you did that wheelie on the Williamsburg Bridge.
Well...
I guess I should go.
Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
"Alex, fantastic news."
"Julian, hello."
My upstairs neighbor.
This is Scott.
"Well, this is awkward."
"Two people about to kiss, and I'm not one of them."
"Well, I have a tavern to get back to."
Okay.
- See ya.
- See ya.
I'm sorry if I ruined your moment there.
"Oh, that's okay."
"So, what's your big news?"
"Your mom's working late tonight, Hogarth."
So it's just us guys.
And we're gonna have a little chat.
Sit down!
How's that?
A little too bright?
Good.
(MANSLEY CHUCKLES)
"Forgive me, Hogarth."
I wanted you to learn something.
What can I learn from you?
"You can learn this, Hogarth."
"That I can do anything I want, whenever I want, if I feel it's in the people's best interest."
"The giant metal man, where is it?"
I don't know what you're talking about.
You don't?
Well.
Does this ring a bell?
No?
How about this?
"You've been careless, Hogarth."
It doesn't prove anything.
It's enough to get the Army here with one phone call.
- Then what's stopping you?
- (YELLS) Where's the giant?
"You can't protect him, Hogarth, any more than you can protect your mother."
My mom?
"Ah, it's difficult to raise a boy all alone."
We can make it more difficult.
"In fact, we can make it so difficult that it would be irresponsible for us to leave you in her care and all that that implies."
"- You'll be taken away from her, Hogarth."
- You can't do that!
- Oh.
Mm.
Jules... is this hug a display of affection or are you just drinking wine?
[ Mouth full ] 'Splay of 'fection.
Adam is not lame.
He may not be tall and good-looking like Pete...
Mm-hmm.
You got that right.
"But-- but he's deep, interesting, and he's tired of cool guy idiots acting like he's inferior."
"If Adam had a fair shot, Kim would've seen his substance and known he's the better guy."
"Oh, so Pete isn't smart and has no substance because he's cool?"
- Well said.
I agree.
- That is so unfair!
"Cool guys can be deep, too."
"You know, you cut them, they bleed."
"And if you call them dumb, they hurt."
"But then they put on a tank top, and everything's okay, so..."
Uncool guys do not have a monopoly over feelings.
"- Hey, where you guys going?"
- Out to the party.
We settled the Kim thing on our own.
We're good.
"Also, this got weird when it became about the two of you."
Later.
About us?
[ Chuckles ]
- What are they talking about?
- No idea.
They're weird.
Totally.
Totally.
"Oh, what a whore she is."
This is despicable.
You are drunk.
My only regret is that I didn't put 20 francs on the mantelpiece the first time.
"I can assure you, monsieur, that Madame Sand will gain no money from you on my account."
Hm?
(JAUNTY MUSIC)
Eugene!
Where's angel fingers?
I've lost him.
- He's taking the Countess d'Agoult home.
- Oh.
"If you plan to invade Poland, you should know that the countess has placed her troops at the border."
What are you talking about?
- I read a love letter she wrote to him.
- What letter?
What did it say?
Marie's jealous of you.
She couldn't stand it if you got a better composer than hers.
I don't know why I dress up.
Nothing here but old men.
You should bring that Mallefille fellow with you.
- He's at Nohant tutoring the children.
- So you took my advice and kept him.
No.
It's all over with us.
- What does he say to that?
- Oh...
He threatens to kill me and himself if I leave him.
He's been reading too many of your books!
- Let's stop here.
"- Mama, it is too cold for you here."
Goes to court tomorrow.
"If you don't give me the name of your source,"
- it's gonna get tossed.
- Bullshit it's gonna get tossed.
I already admitted to you I took part in it.
It's not enough.
Why is that not enough?
You got my word.
We got no corroboration of your word.
What's to say you didn't make up this whole thing when I came in here?
Then go to the goddamn prosecutor
I went to seven years ago.
She's got it all on record.
I thought she didn't pursue this case.
Then you didn't hear me right.
She pursued it.
She just didn't want to see it through.
Ask her if I'm telling the truth.

"Louis, I was just making a cup of coffee."
I know that.
You're going to take over.
You're going to be the Don.
"If what I think has happened, has happened, I'm leaving here tonight."
I give you complete power.
Over Fredo and his men.
"Rocco, Neri, everyone."
"I'm trusting you with the lives of my wife and my children, the future of this family."
"-If we catch them, will we find out..."
-We won't catch them.
"Unless I'm very wrong, they're dead already."
They were killed by somebody close to us.
Inside.
"Very, very frightened that they botched it."
You don't think that Rocco and Neri had something to do with this?
See...
All our people are businessmen.
Their loyalty is based on that.
One thing I learned from Pop was to try to think as people around you think.
"On that basis, anything is possible."
"Mike, they're dead!"
Right outside my window!
I want to get out of here.
They're lying there dead!
Over here!
There's two of them.
Looks like they were hired out of New York.
I don't recognize them.
Won't get anything out of them now.
Fish them out.
Get rid of the bodies.
-Where's Mike?
"I just wish you would, too, you know?"
Hey.
I don't know why I had to be married to such a good man.
Who I'm still mad at.
"He'll just stay the night, Jackie."
And he's out by morning.
Yes.
Abbs?
Abby.
"Gibbs, oh."
Sorry I woke you.
I woke you.
I woke you first when I called you.
You spent the night here?
"Yeah, Tony found the knife in question in Petty Officer Smith's seabag, and I kind of got on a roll testing it, and the next thing I knew, the sun was coming up."
Was it worth it?
Totally.
"I mean, even with my little windows, the light was just gorgeous."
"Abbs, I haven't had my coffee yet."
"Ooh, all right."
The knife.
So it tested positive for blood but in the trout family.
These scales that are lodged in the handle suggest rainbow or steelhead.
No blood from Adams.
Means Petty Officer Smith wasn't our killer.
But somebody is.
"You know, it's probably somebody that we don't even know yet."
Or someone we do.
"Abbs, you stayed here overnight trying to clear Vance's brother-in-law?"
"Well, the director is like family."
"I mean, you would want me to do the same for you."
Tox results.
"My mother, on the other hand, resisted what she called the sly ways of the place with a fiery, feral determination."
"She dwelt in Moybeg, but she didn't live there."
And it seems she never gave Barnhill's letter to Emma.
Perhaps she felt that a note from beyond the grave was just too much for my sister to bear even as a grown woman.
What's this?
What do you think it is?
Stolen goods.
- Mrs. Coyne.
"- Rose, please."
Men are a deal more likely to do favours for a woman than for a man.

My name is Andrew Black.

They've got the flag up.
"Well, they may put it down again."

"I have to tell the truth, Seamie!"
You said that.
OK.
"You guys, he's being very annoying."
"Uh, Shel, would you ever have sex with me and then lie to me immediately afterwards?"
"Oh, no, sweetie."
I get all my lying done beforehand.
"I mean there's still a few girls in Detroit who think they had sex with Cleveland from ""Family Guy."""
Okay.
I want Danny to spend time with my son.
He promised that he would and now he's trying to pull out.
"I can help you, Nick."
I'm here for you.
Who can help your hunger?
"Your craving for the warm, sweet taste of blood."
"You can beat it, Nick."

"Man, tell me...."
"Oh, no."
I will go get my earplugs.
- Where's your owner?
"- Hi, Olivia."
- Hi.
- I don't have an owner.
- Olivia.
- Good to see you.
I hope you're not back for an encore because last night was a one-time thing.
"No, you left me quite depleted."
I could barely walk.
"- So, what's up?"
- I have a problem.
I hear you have special skills for hire.
They are.
Let's talk rates.
"Whatever you have to say, you can say in front of Kenzi."
"So, what's the job?"
I want you to kill someone.
And that's gonna cost extra.
"When you mate for life, and your life is centuries you make it work."
So you invite other Fae into bed whenever you get bored.
Keeps things exciting.
"But we've had a rule, no snacking behind each other's backs."
- Naturally.
- What happened?
Samir and I own an event-planning business.
The girl's a florist we used on one occasion.
Her name's Jenny.
So Samir couldn't keep his hands off the help?
That's typical.
- I didn't know he was shucking around.
- Shucking?
Please write it down.
Pen is not working.
Dad leave it.
"You just get to Pondi, and go to the Hotel Blue Diamond."
I'll will courier all the pictures and details.
Please Dad don't say bra and panty over there.
Let's see how's her design.
"I'm a designer, You'll see Name of my brand Pure Diamonds."
Will be on everyone's toung.
Whole world will wear my undergarments.
Not less.
Not more.
Please leave.
It's simple.
Make me leave or I'll leave.
Actually you father and my father were partners in this restaurant.
So either you buy the whole restaurant or let me buy.
You know that I don't have that kind of money.
Why don't you keep half?
M.M. Munde never takes half.
Whole world knows that.
"I will pay you back slowly, slowly."
How slow Jia Jee?
Tommorow at 11:00 my client is coming here to meet me.
He'll like my design definitely.
And Jia's doors of destiny will open.
"Come Tommorow at 12:00, you'll get the money."
"Tommorow at 12:00, it'll be your bad time or mine."
If just Laxminarayan likes my designs.
"Here, Ticket."
Look son.
Do the murder nicely.
Girl's gotta have some secrets.
- To mysteries.
- To solving them.
Damn it.
Yes.
The bidders have arrived.
Let's get going.
I have to go...
And so do you.
So soon?
Some things are not meant to be.
A flower?
"Yeah, but check out the tube."
It's the exact same thing we found in Amanda's cabin.
"You guys, don't tell me, we uncovered a cartel of evil florists?"
"Bos, can you get a match on the flower?"
Already tried.
Got nothing.
- How wide was your scan?
- Seven continents.
"Whatever that flower is, it's one-of-a-kind."
Roman's guarding his lucite-encased corsage tighter than a kid on prom night.
It was important enough to make Amanda disappear.
And to make Roman break a date with you.
That says something.
I don't like it.
"Too many pieces, not enough puzzle."
We need a connection.
You said Roman got a call?
Yeah.
"It was kind of a mood-killer, actually."
"Someone told him the bidders were here, and that's when he grabbed his keycards and split."
Tell Ruth Hedeby that the case is wide open.
We're not closing anything.
"Call those who've taken time off, back in."
The resources will be there when management sees what I've just seen.
- They didn't find anything in Jutland.
- Then send the men out again.
"Ask the local police to keep searching for Emilie, and coordinate it with Lund."
Give them all the help they need.
Call the Zeuthens in for an urgent briefing.
Asbjorn is asking for reinforcements.
They've traced the perpetrator.
"Asbjorn, what's happening?"
Lund and Borch have tracked him down.
We're on our way there.
It didn't sound good.
They're not in control.
- What's the problem?
- Apparently they're trapped inside.
"I don't know what happened, but we're on our way."
Yes?
What's up?
"Push the book under the door, then I'll spare you."
He wants the book.
Give that to me.
"Listen, we don't have that book."
People are on their way here.
Turn the damn car engine off.
Do you hear me?
Hello?
Hello!
"No, you do it."
"You do it, and then get me out."
Just do it!
"You are really rude, aren't you?"
You're making me angry.
It was three days ago.
I saw you walking along side him in the Ginza.
That was in daylight.
"If you continue to do things like that, I'll stop talking to you."
It's just a joke.
"Look, I've always wanted you."
You know that.
Am I bothering you?
"Well, if I am, there's nothing I can do about it."
It's just my rengai for you.
"You know, Mrs. I'm not trying to get you directly, but I am trying to get you."
You are my ultimate goal.
"I was waiting for you to fall in love with someone, and then when that fell apart,"
I was going to snap you up.
"My heart has been broken already, so it doesnt makeanydifferencetome if  youvelovedsomeoneelse ."
"Ah, miss, over here."
I came with Nozu-san.
How do you do.
Thanks for taking care of Shinako for me.
Don't worry about that.
What happened?
"Mother, Kayama-sensei was here!"
Kayama-sensei?
He just left.
What would he be doing here after giving up dancing?
"Mother, I want to meet him."
Don't you think it would be better not to meet him?
I just want to see him.
You should go to Tokyo Station now.
And Mary's.
Sharpening my chompers and waiting for wonders.
"I'll ship your miserly, meagre coffin back."
I don't like you.
It's because of her.
"She's deranged, she feels the cold."
What's eating you up...
"Shut your trap, Mr. Innocent!"
Don't forget that I'm being generous to you!
Just like the Police at home!
Do you want to feel my trotter?
A big portion of Parisian pig trotter?
Braised too?
Thrash him out!
His stupid suitcase too!
In case he falls over even more.
You still in one piece?
"It's my fault, I shouldn't have left you all by yourself."
I like it raw.
But I would like it to get raw for me.
Curse you.
"Mary, full of ice,"
"The Lord is against thee,"
"Punished art thou among women, and punished is the fruit of thy womb."

"Anyway, we need one more."
Darling!
"I have no parents, no job, no home, no money, no education, no skills."
All I have is a disease.
And everyone ignores me.
My fiancé even dumped me.
I'm so sorry.
But I tried hard to survive.
For her.
"No, for this country and society!"
To be a helpful person.
Like Wonder Woman!
Wonder Woman?
She's my only friend and idol.
"She must be pretty, right?"
All men are only crazy about pretty girls.
I wish all pretty things would die.
Even the fishes in the river would run away from your ugly face.
"You die instead, you wench."
Hello?
I can't tell you right now.
I'll explain when we meet later.
"Well, I caught a big fish this time."
"I know you don't believe me, but this is a really big catch."
"No, I'm not playing games."
Shut up!
Tell me where you are!
Damn it.
Okay.
This time I want to get a little more creative.
You got a wind machine handy?
Just shoot me.
Okay.
Great.
I'm going to have to take the camera to the dance with me and keep having my picture taken.
Don't let anyone else in the picture.
"If people aren't flickering out, they'll gain a hundred pounds."
And to think I used to complain when I got a run in my stocking.
"I keep him in a little glass jar, which I refer to as ""Oz."""
Uh-oh.
Jailbreak.
You lost him?
"Oh, perfect."
"Thanks to your overreacting, I get to spend my Friday night looking for a cockroach with my sister."
"Oh, come on."
This is stuff that keeps us young.
Ooh!
I think I see a dropping.
You look terrific.
Do you think so?
Because this is more of a standing-up dress than a sitting-down dress.
I thought we'd be standing up more.
It's too bad your car doesn't have a sunroof.
You look terrific.
"So, what's up with the camera?"
"Oh, you know, I wanted to preserve the memories of our big night."
"Uh, did you drop your left cuff link?"
What was that?
Northern lights?
(upbeat music playing)
I thought we're being honest here.
"You got some balls, you know that."
All of you.
"You want to talk about self-control, how about you, Sil?"
Fucking every slut working in the place when you got a wife and kids.
"Or you, Paulie."
Remember last winter in the woods with the Russian guy?
I am warning you!
"There he goes, Mr. Type A personality."
We're talking about you killing yourself with drugs!
Not my fucking personality!
-Right.
-I'm going to kill myself?
"The way you eat, you'll have a heart attack before you're 50."
-Sit down.
-You're talking to the boss.
"Good, maybe someone will smack some goddamn sense into him!"
"Great, my own mother."
"Fuck you, you fucking whore!"
Son of a bitch!
"Guys, please!"
Come on!
Stop it!
Excuse me.
How's he doing?
I'm a relative.
He slipped off the kitchen counter spraying for ants?
He was wearing socks.
-Are you aware that he has a drug problem?
-Really?
The man has a hairline skull fracture.
"We'll admit him, keep him overnight."
"Mr. Goode, no matter where this ends up, I want you to know, justice was done here today."
Whoo-hoo!
Yes!
Congratulations.
"I am rarely speechless, but I am speechless."
Thank you.
Thank you both.
It's not over yet.
"They're going to drag this out in appeals, so..."
I thought it was going against us.
Sometimes fate smiles.
"Will, are you standing or sitting?"
Which one do you want me to be?
You're kidding.
You're kidding.
Do you know what this means?
That we can pay off our balloon payment.
And dodge the executioner for another quarter.
If you get a settlement.
Where's Canning at?
He'll appeal.
For effect.
$25 million should motivate him.
"Peter, you okay?"
We have a problem with the house.
We?
"Uh, Jackie."
She paid ten percent in cash on the down payment.
"Apparently, she was bidding against someone."
Me.
She was bidding against me.
So I'm planning on going ahead with the purchase and then flipping the house in a few months.
Why does he have this?
He had a congenital heart defect.
An... an aortic valve stenosis.

We haven't.

Something big is happening at work and I have to prepare for it.
What about my dance class?
"Oh, I'm sorry, honey."
Today's gonna be different.
Self-affirming.
"Well, so you really need that written on your chest?"
You don't already know it?
"No, I don't already know I'm a precious, wondrous... special, unique, divine, rare, valuable, whole... sacred, total, complete, entitled, worthy and deserving person."
I don't know that.

We have to hold this for one to two minutes.
"So, how's the separation going?"
Orwas that temporary?
Maybe even momentary?
"No, we're really separated."
But we have two kids.
Okay.
How old are they?
It's a real madhouse in here.
It's 'cause of the sale we're having.
"Well, go if you need to go."
How did you do that?
"Oh, well, do you want the long version or the short version?"
The long one.
"I was trying to save my life, and it didn'twork."
What's the short one?
I burned it.
And when doyou get to take that off?
I don't know.
I think when it stops hurting.
"Yes, of course, I want all those things."
Then tell mary I will cause her no harm ever.
And that she will cause you no harm
By loving you.
By marrying you.
Go to her.
Marie:
But do it quickly.
I see your son's return has restored your will to live.
It's because he will live.
Your magic has changed.
How silly and marvelous.

"No, I never did."

From making the biggest mistake of her life.
Where is she?
Heading for a church near a quarry.
The servants talked about a village
Nearly destroyed by the plague.
"Yes, I bribed them."
He may as well know
"Who I am, if we're to be kin."
I know the place.
Then hurry.
His hands on everything you want.
"Your majesty, a messenger has arrived."
He said there's news regarding the line of succession.
But Brian wouldn't lie.
So it's like...
it's like she's this completely different person.
Like a slut?
No.
"No, she's not."
I think she's just confused or something.
- Do you want me to kill her?
"- No, it doesn't matter."
Brian's the one who ought to be killed.
He should definitely die.
You know he's going to rat on Rickie.
What actually is there to rat on Rickie.
Do you know?
"I know whatever he did, he did because he had to."
You haven't had to clean him up after some Neanderthal...
beat the hell out of him.
"Come here for a minute, son."
Rickie Vasquez.
Are you familiar with the name?
Excuse me?
"What can you tell me, son, about Rickie Vasquez?"
He goes here.
"I don't, I mean..."
Did you hear something...
Did he see something about the gun?
"Mr. Krakow, I'm going to tell you about a little legal term."

"AII right then, lads, tourists for the day."
"Get in, NiaII."
Ghetto.
Can we do one of those pictures where you go like that?
How do you do that?
Where you stand like this?
"Like, touching the top."
-How do you do that?
-You have to get down.
Is it working?
Looks like you're holding it up.
We're back now.
Start of the European leg of the tour.
Do you know what I'm thinking?
We need to try one of them local delicacy things from every place.
And here's the frog legs and snail stuff.
Are you down?
I'm not down for snails.
I think we should try it in every place.
Just try a delicacy from somewhere.
I've tried frogs but that's still not that weird.
"Like, snails is probably a bit disgusting."
"We've never toured Europe before so because this is the first time we've done it, it feels like an adventure because a different country every day, it feels like we're on Euro rip."

You and I are gonna talk later.
Yes?
- I'm not sure I want to talk to you.
- Sandy.
Kirsten is the one good thing in your life.
How could you do this to her?
After all she has done for you?
- I have to think of my marriage.
- What does Julie Cooper know about being the CEO. of a multimillion dollar company?
- It's a figurehead position.
You said so yourself.
Kirsten will continue to run the show.
- And work for Julie?
Why the hell w
- What do you suggest I do?
- I suggest you find a way to make it up to Kirsten now.
"Unless you want Julie to be your lawyer, too."
- Can you see okay?
"- Yeah, I can see fine."
"- There's no, like, obstructed views or anything, right?"
- Right.
- Okay.
"I just know, sometimes at shows, you can't see so well, 'cause, you know, the tall people are standing."
"Yeah, right, you know, but now I'm just having a hard time hearing."
"- But, thanks for getting me a seat."
- No problem.
The same reason why she wanted to fly around the world... so she didn't have to deal with me.
Why are you telling me this?
You should be telling her.
Greg!
This is coffin talk.
"You know, you're critical of your mom, but you're the one who's thinking of herself right now."
You're acting just like her.
"So, this is it, Greg."
This is where your life ends.
"Sweetheart, this is your chance to have a real conversation with your mother."
Fine.
I've never been able to get through to her.
At least you know how to touch her.
Hey.
Everything okay?
"Oh, my God."
So good!
I know it's none of my business...
Here's where you stop talking.
- ...but if you want my opinion...
- I don't.
...medication has done wonders for my step-kids.
"- Viv, I am not gonna..."
- I get it.
"I had my doubts about it going in, too."
"But those kids were totally out of control, and once I started taking these,"
I found them much easier to handle.
"So, these pills help you smile through the pain?"
I feel nothing.
Mm.
"So, turns out Anna-Kat doesn't need drugs..."
We do.
- Not at all.
Do you think we're alone in life?
I get criticized because I... don't take care of my family.
You know my parents have nothing.
I can't support... two families.
Go back to your parents if you want.
You talk to me like that... precisely now?
How can you want me away from my parents?
"Besides, it's you who forced me to work."
"From now on, I will work."
Did you find an employer?
That's my problem.
Also mine.
"Anyway, it'll happen soon."
"My only frustration in this relationship, is not having children."
And also mine!
"If we don't have kids,"
I can't do anything.
I don't want to hear you... talking that way.
"Let's stop this discussion, we're too nervous."
"Smarten up, tonight we'll be having dinner at the Director's house."
I don't want to go.

Either your informant is bad or someone's taking the mickey.
Now can you tell me who gave you this shitty tip?
You'd better cross your fingers he's forgotten your face.
I have a bad feeling about this.
Hello?
Now?
I'm coming.
I have to go.
What about the debriefing on the whores?
Start without me.
And be ready.
We're doing it again tonight.
Where are you taking me?
Nowhere.
The road ends here.
You didn't realise it was a trap?
I give you information about the squat and you charge straight in.
"I saw you leaving the hotel, you and your guys."
Someone from your team has enquired several times about this case.
Who the fuck are you protecting?
Don't say anything.

Get lost.
We both made a mistake.
There's nothing left to say.

So am I.
How's Pavlos?
A good question!
He's been very sad ever since your breakup.
At first he used to come here every night and sit alone and miserable at this very table.
Every night!
Getting drunk...
Don't you see him anymore?
- What's his life like nowadays?
- He lives in poverty.
I pleaded he painted more moons on my walls to no avail...
Let it go!
He has this fixation with painting in the penthouse.
- Day and night!
"- So, he works?"
Yes but what's the point?
Who buys paintings these days?
- Perhaps someone now at the exhibition.
- What exhibition?
He is exhibiting his work at a gallery for a week now.
"It's in the papers, didn't you know?"
"No, I didn't."
"I'll go buy a framed picture for the tavern to aid the poor guy, cause... he's in dire straits!"
I can tell you that he's starving.
"No other way of helping him, proud as he is, you know him, Aliki."
"Yes, I know."
"I looked thoroughly, Aliki."
No bracelet.
I'm sorry.
-Are you serious?
It's the middle of the night.
"-I feel really bad, that's all."
"I haven't been in touch, you know, since that night."
"I think we both got a bit carried away, didn't we?"
"Well, I know."
"It was... like a cheap 1 950s farce with underwear, and husbands and hiding in cupboards, but at least we kept our heads in the end and didn't actually do anything, so...."
"Anyway, top and bottom of it is I just want you to know this..."
Bob and I decided to get back together again.
"Well, that's fantastic."
"Really great, Irene."
I'm thrilled to hear that.
"Well, hopefully great, we'll see."
I just hate to think that that made you feel... in any way....
-Rejected?
"-God, is that what you feel?"
-No.
"No, of course not."
No way.
"-'Cause, you know..."
"I'll always have a soft spot for you, Gil."
-It's just....
-What's happening here?
-Is everything okay?
-Bob?
Of course it's okay.
It's fine.
-Will you stop worrying and go back to bed?
-Wondered where the hell you'd gone.
For goodness sake.
"Look, I'll tell you later."
"Now, let's just leave him in peace."
At last.
"Now, will you get the luggage off immediately and take it straight to our rooms?"
I do not understand why we weren't met properly.
"Well, I think it's simply wonderful."
It's so unspoiled.
"Eh, it's pretty enough, but it's such a long way to come, such an awful journey."
You'll enjoy bathing and lazing about.
We could have done that in Brixen.
Why you wanted to drag us all this way...
"You'll adore it here, I know."
I can see that you mean to enjoy yourself.
"Oh, well."
"Give me a bath and a bed, and perhaps it'll be better in the morning."
"– Tony, darling?"
– Yes?
My cigarette case.
She makes me feel so undercooked.
I'm so patchy still.
She really is so lucky.
"Oh, dear, that bathing dress is a mistake."
Morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Lovely day.
DOUGLAS:
"Shall I put yours here, darling?"
MARJORIE:
"Yes, so I can get a little bit of sun."
"I feel so dreadfully faded, but I freckle rather than going brown."
Have you ever been to Rhodes before?
No.
"It's lovely, isn't it?"
"Uh, let's get you on a cardiac monitor."
"CBC, chem panel, EKG..."
I realize that.
"I'm sure he is, but this isn't about me, him, or even you."
It's about the welfare of a mother and her child.
You will?
Great!
Thank you so much.
"Um, psych attending's coming down to assess Judy Anderson."
"If Dr. Wakita asks, you agree with my postpartum depression assessment, right?"
"Yeah, you got it."
"Mr. and Mrs. Anderson,"
I have some good news.
One of our attendings from upstairs has agreed to come down and speak with you.
I've seen enough doctors today.
- We're going home.
"- Please, he's on his way down right now."
- We've been here for hours already.
- This will only take a few minutes.
"I just want to go home, have dinner and a bath and put Grace in her own crib."
"You want what's best for your baby, so do I."
Then leave us alone.
- Judy you need to speak to someone.
- She just needs to rest.
I know you don't want to hurt yourself or Grace.
You need professional help.
Do you have children?
Then how do you even know what you're talking about?
- I'm a doctor.
- But you're not a mother.
"Judy, listen to me..."
Please don't go.
"Not a lot to go on, is there?"
Cup of coffee?
Sir?
Except the panic.
The panic?
"Yes, sir."
I might have something in this area.
See what you think.
Mrs. Daley was shot at a distance of 30 feet and she was shot in the back.
Are you with me so far?
"Yes, I think I can grasp that."
"Now,"
Tony...
He's the owner of the deli.
"He said that the killer was ""cool as a cucumber."""
"That's a direct quote, sir."
"So that means that when Mrs. Daley tried to run, that's when he lost his cool."
"See, that's when he panicked and he shot her."
"But he hit her right in the heart, sir, and at the distance of 30 feet while she was running."
"Now, that's hard to do in a panic."
What do you think?
"I think that I had better try and help you because you're going to ask me to, aren't you?"
"You did it again, sir."
You read my mind.
Would you?
"Oh, that would be an honor."
Detective Lucerne helping me.
Wait till I tell my wife.
Somebody asking for me?
"Oh, Sid, it's all right."
This is Lieutenant Columbo from the police department.
"This is Claire's husband, Sid Daley."
What did you say?
I said i don't like you.
Hmm.
That makes me feel very badly.
"I don't like you, either!"
Are you quite sure of that?
I wish i were just as sure that jim was safe over in jersey with all that cash.
Always leaning on jim.
"What do you mean, always leaning on jim?"
"Well, aren't you?"
"What would you do without his brains, his generosity, his shrewdness?"
You'd be lost.
"Without his friendship, i'd be lost."
"Excuse me, miss mansfield, there are two reporters from the paper to see you."
Send them in.
"Oh, hello, mr."
Boyd.
"We thought you were over in jersey with the erie gang- i mean, fisk and drew."
"Good evening, miss mansfield."
Good evening.
"What do you want, boys?"
Anything jim fisk does tonight is news.
We're running down a story.
What kind of story?
"You won't get mad if i say it, will you?"
What is it?
"They're saying in wall street that the only person smart enough to get the best of jim fisk is-excuse me- is miss mansfield, that vanderbilt's 10 millions will slip through fisk's hands into hers."
"Wait a minute, mr."
Boyd.
We were sent up here to ask you.
That's our job.
Exactly.
we'll have to leave town.
What's gonna happen if Flo leaves town and closes her station?
"- Without gas, we're done for!"
- What?
Don't you think the car responsible should fix our road?
The only guy strong enough to fix that road is Big Al!
"Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago."
"Then why are you bringing him up, you lemon?"
"Oh, he can do it."
He's got the horsepower.
"So, what do you want him to do?"
Fix the road!
- Because we are a town worth fixing!
- Yeah!
Order in the court!
Seems like my mind has been changed for me.
- Yeah!
- No!
Nice ruling.
"Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner."
"That's OK, Stickers."
You can take Bessie.
"Man, you get to work with Bessie!"
I'd give my left two lug nuts for somethin' like that.
Bessie?
Who's Bessie?
"This here is Bessie, finest road-pavin' machine ever built."
I'm hereby sentencing you to community service.
You're gonna fix the road under my supervision.
What?
This place is crazy!
"I know this may be a bad time right now, but you owe me $32,000 in legal fees."
Grace.
"And Jack, right?"
(CLEARS THROAT)
You slept with her?
I feel bad that Ben didn't want to eat with us.
I felt badly he lied to me yet again.
"Well, Leo, maybe you're just going to have to let him date Dylan."
"No, I'm not."
"I want to say something, if I may..."
"I hope, whatever it is, it starts with an apology."
No.
It doesn't.
"I just want to say that if you're going to tell me who to date,"
I think I should have every right to tell you who to date.
What!
Yeah.
"And unless you plan on getting her pregnant or importing some offspring from some other source and adopting them, you should quit dating Camille."
"No offense, Camille."
Are you drunk?
"No, I'm perfectly sober."
"Last time, you married a hooker and I didn't speak up."
This time I'm speaking up.
You two do not belong together.
You're too fat and she's too thin.
She probably can't even get pregnant.
"If she could, she would have trapped you by now."
(GROANS)
(LAUGHING)
You want to get married?
Ow.
Well?
Seriously?
Ma?
Jesus.
This won't be easy for any of us.
But I want you to know that we're here today because we care about you.
"-What was this, your idea?"
-All we ask is that you listen.
"Adriana, you want to begin?"
"""Christopher, I love you very much."
"""My only dream is that we have a happy life together."
"""The last few months, things have got very bad with us..."
"""because of you using drugs all the time."
"-""You're high all the time and I can't take it."""
"-Be specific, hon."
"""When we first started going out, we made love all the time."
"-""Now, because of the drugs..."""
"-Jesus, is this fucking necessary?"
Go ahead.
"""...you can no longer function as a man."
"""Last week when I came home to learn that you had killed our dog..."
"""that was the final straw."""
You killed the dog?
What'd you do that for?
-It was an accident.
-Was it barking?
He sat on her while he was high.
-Jesus Christ.
-I fell asleep.
She got suffocated or something.
"Are you done, Adriana?"
You killed little Cosette?
"I ought to suffocate you, you little prick!"
"Tony, we're going in order."
Why don't... you and I have a duel?
I will challenge you with my life!
You betray me for the sake of these workers
Have they been treating you well?
I know I owe you righteousness
I can only repay in my next life
But you owe them justice!
You have to repay it today!
Bullshit!
Let them all understand crystal clear
Who is... the master here!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him!
People!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him!
"If I die,"
none of you should take any action on my behalf
Think about your families
They are waiting for you at home
Fei
Can you win?
"If both sides get into a fight, there will be a lot of casualties"
It's better I die
Than to have the whole place drowned in blood
Promise me
"If I fall, you have to make them go home"
Let him in
Close the door!
You want to burn me to death?
"She was like-- She was like,"
"""What's next, motherfucker?"
"What's--"""
I'm--
"But, look, it's a few entertainers who got that power, okay?"
"It's like--there's another dude that can do that,"
Chris Brown.
"Yep, y'all gotta give it up for Chris Brown."
"Come on, dog, why y'all ain't clapping, man?"
"Come on, why y'all ain't clapping?"
It's not like he hit y'all.
What the hell?
He's an all-around entertainer.
"He can sing, he can dance, pop-lock, box just a little bit."
"Um, okay, I know he was in a situation with Rihanna."
Okay.
And that's in the past.
"And, folks, you know people's love."
You can't help who you love.
You just can't.
You can't help who you love.
"Some women love their man so much, even whatever situation they are in, they make up excuses for them."
"""Girl, this is a circle of trust."""
"""No, bitch, that's a black eye."
"""Go get that checked out."
"That's terrible."""
"And fellas, I ain't condoning--"
You should not put your hands on a woman.
"You should not do that, okay?"
"If you do that, you should be ashamed of yourself, 'cause that's sick."
Violence isn't funny...
all the time.
And don't change the subject.
"Then there was the Pender Drug account, and Sheridan Cement."
All first class.
And all the others.
I haven't thought about hours or days off.
I've proved my loyalty and it's about time you gave me an unqualified vote of confidence.
"Now, Larry, either I get that Waterhouse account or you get yourself a new boy."
- You got it.
"I mean it, Larry."
I've got the Waterhouse account?
That's what I wanted to tell you when you came in.
Yesterday you said I couldn't have the account because I was too immature.
"What did I do, age overnight?"
"I just thought it over, and this morning I changed my mind."
"And Darrin, I know you'll do a great job."
- Good luck.
"- Thanks, Larry."
You won't be sorry.
I still don't get it.
What made you change your mind?
"- Oh, it's the boss' prerogative."
- I'll buy that.
"Boy, I can't wait to tell Sam."
I was tempted to tell her myself but I knew that you wanted that pleasure.
"Oh, yeah."
When...
When did you see Samantha?
"Oh, just now."
Down in the parking lot.
There's a great little wife you've got there.
Has your every interest at heart.
She sure has.
It's not the first time either.
"He was arrested 5 years ago-- intimidation, embezzlement."
"He's got his hooks into your sergeant, too, for that matter."
"I'd watch out, if I were you."
"Well, they certainly met in London."
Rather more than that.
They had dinner together after the meeting.
Spencer's taken him very much under his wing.
[Telephone rings]
[Ring]
Excuse me.
[Ring]
Foyle:
Mr. Lane.
Ian:
You've got my boy locked up.
"Well, he ran away."
He was off to London.
He was afraid of you!
He's no criminal.
"Well, assault, drunk and disorderly, skipped bail, did borstal--August to November last year."
That was then.
It hasn't been easy for him living on his own with me.
He lost his mother when he was 9.
She ran off.
It's just been two of us.
"And yes, he mixed with the wrong set and became a cropper with the law."
You people never forget.
Won't let him forget neither.
"It's a bit more than that, isn't it?"
"He was seen at the hotel on the night of the murder, which means he could easily have been the one who took the gun and shot Mrs. Ellis."
He never shot anyone.
Do you want to?
You see him?
You...
"Anyway, Mitchell, I have in my hand a piece of paper."
Phase two of Find Mitchell AJob Campaign.
"Oh, Annie, Annie, it doesn't matter."
I'm considering other options anyway.
"Mitchell, you're not a quitter."
It says so here in the reference that I wrote.
Check this out.
"""John Mitchell is the finest employee I ever had."
"""He is loyal and dependable and valued by all his co-workers."
"""I recall he did not give the best interview..."""
- Whoa!
"- ""...but I put that down to nerves."""
"What, so I make a habit of screwing up interviews?"
"""But how glad am I that I took a chance on him?"
Very.
"""Because I was rewarded with a pleasant and reliable worker,"
"""who would be an asset to any company."
"""Plus, let's face it, he's easy on the eye."""
I'm just covering all my bases.
Yeah.
You know what?
Maybe I just don't want to be a hospital cleaner any more.
"No, of course you don't."
"This is just the beginning, Mitchell."
"With me in your corner, next year you could be in the canteen."
I'm going to type this up.
What's up?
- Where's Adam?
- He's in the kitchen.
But that's like the German thinking.
"A German would be like,"
"""That's right."
You cannot drive it when the bedroom is out.
"""There must be a button or else you can't drive."""
"But Americans are like,"
"""Yeah, man, whatever."" It's America."
"""Do what you want - it's America!"""
Did you not look in your wing mirror and notice...
There's a house!
"Oh, it's me."
..that your vehicle was so much bigger?
"It was my first day of filming, 10, 12 hours."
I was exhausted.
All I could think about was I've got to...
"Look ahead, look ahead."
"I was like, ""I gotta drive my house home."""
Did you hit anything?
"Did you wipe anyone out, like a motorcyclist?"
"No, but you know what?"
"""What happened to you?"" ""I got hit by a house on the freeway."""
Here's the craziest thing in America.
You do...
That's a big sentence.
"Yeah, that is a big sentence."
"OK, here's one of the many crazy things in America."
"Because they want to sell these things to senior citizens and senior citizens tend to be not the best drivers, you don't have to have a special licence to buy an RV."
"Oh, really?"
"Yeah, no special licence."
Two pooping-based questions.
Yes?
"One, when you send down a, you know, a Bismarck..."
Any of the guys on the team talked about the e-mail or the murder?
"No, not in front of me, anyway."
We got state championship coming up tomorrow.
That what they're focusing on.
"Life goes on, right?"
Not for everybody.
Is Todd Fleming around?
We want to ask him a few questions.
Fleming!
Front and center.
Come on!
Keep it going!
"Look, I don't know anything about what happened, okay?"
None of us do.
If that's why you guys came down here...
We found alligator blood on Coach Nelson's roof.
We think it was a part of your science project.
"What were you doing up there, Todd?"
I wasn't up there.
I...
"Look, even if I was, up there, what does it matter?"
"'Cause it's a murder investigation, smart guy."
Everything matters.
I didn't kill him.
We'll talk about this downtown.
- I'm in the middle of practice.
- Practice can wait.
Am I under arrest or something?
"Look, Todd, do you have any street clothes you can change into?"
We just want to talk to you.
"- Yeah, in, in the locker room."
- Let's go.
"Oh, you ungrateful child!"
You don't care about anyone but yourself!
How did you get that way?
You know what losing your father has done to me and yet you take your life and throw it around like it was worthless!
Why?
'Cause I wish I was dead.
Don't you understand that!
?
"I wish I'd died over there, Mom!"
"Well, you didn't die and I'll be damned if I'll stand around and watch you kill yourself."
Enough.
"Enough, Mom."
God.
You guys are so freaking serious.
"Hey, sorry."
- Hey.
So late.
Any word from Justin?
"- Yeah, he got arrested."
Don't ask.
He's fine.
You almost missed grilled cheese night.
"I'm sorry, I've let us all down."
They're out of grass skirts.
They just sold the last one.
These'll be great.
"Today is one of those days where everything you decide really, really, really matters."
You....need something aside from grilled cheese.
"You need someone to say, ""Congratulations!"""
What for?
Your promotion.
How did you know?
Access...
- Confidential?
"No, no, no."
I don't know anything.
"The last time I talked to her it was just, ""The kid this, the kid that."""
"According to our records, you spoke to her on the 15th."
- Three weeks ago?
- Yeah.
"Yeah, that makes sense."
I...
She was going to Vegas.
"Oh, is that right?"
Vegas?
She asked me to go along with her.
It was gonna be her treat.
I couldn't go because I had to work.
We were gonna stay at one of those ritzy new places.
"The, um, Bellage..?"
- The Bellagio?
Right.
- Yeah.
- With the contortionist.
- I've never been.
You've been going through my desk.
It never crossed my mind when I was a younger woman... that I'd be this age and not have kids.
"Somehow in my mind, kids."
"Raising them, making them good people."
That's what I wanted.
"Then I met you, and I realized that I'd be... trading my dreams so that we could live yours."
We sacrificed all of that so we could do good.
We have done good.
I was never prouder when you fought to make hate crimes a capital and federal offense.
You must be Danny.
"- Killer pipes, man."
Thank you.
Yes.
I went through a choral camp every summer as a kid and I was the first male Annie.
"We are a real odd couple, you and me."
I bet that we're just gonna end up arguing and apologizing to each other over and over again every week.
"In my flashbacks, I let the boys speak for themselves."
Yep.
Feels like it was just yesterday.
"What a crazy, crazy wild time."
"We became room-mates after that, but you know the story."
What does that have to do with anything?
"The reason he needed a new room-mate is because his old room-mate got married and left, and they were never really friends ever again."
Yeah.
And now it's happening to Danny all over.
"Oh, okay..."
You're a mess.
"The poor guy, he feels abandoned, dude."
"Well, I guess I have to make this..."
I'm sorry.
I guess I...
You know what?
Enough monkeying around.
I gotta make this right.
Good luck kiss.
"Now you get out there and you git him, soldier!"
Of course Trent works here.
Candace used to see all this for free.
Now people gotta pay me a buck for it.
Bam!
Capitalism.
What have you done with Nicholas?
What have I done with Nicholas?
"He can't hear you now, pal."
"Oh, come on."
You know he's dead.
Yeah.
"You ought to do something with that faulty memory of yours, pal."
Might make your life a little bit easier.
"By the way, I just love them little notes you leave for yourself."
That one on the refrigerator just kills me.
"Where is your hospitality, partner?"
"If someone walks in, he might get the wrong idea."
Who are you?
"Well, looks like you got some explaining to do, partner."
I know who you are.
I know who you are.
I know who you are.
I know who you are.
"You going somewhere, Mr. Reznik?"
"Yeah, Mrs. shrike, I'm moving."
I didn't receive notice.
Your lease requires you to give 30 days notice in writing.
"It wasn't planned, something came up."
You can keep my security deposit.
I won't be needing it anyway.
"Really, Mr. Reznik?"
You used to be such a good tenant.
I just don't understand it.
"Oh, isn't that pretty?"
Would you care to sell it?
"No, it was my mother's."
I've made arrangements to donate all my things.
This is really weird for me.
"I'm used to having sex with whoever I want whenever I want, not settling down with one guy."
"But sometimes your instincts change, and you just have to go with it."
"Oh, my God."
Gabriel?
!
New York has a way of changing you...
Sometimes in ways you don't expect.
♪ Darken the city
♪ night is a wire
♪ steam in the subway
♪ earth is afire
"♪ do do do, do do do it's just a loan, you know?"
- I'll pay you back.
"- Sure, dad."
"♪ Woman, you want me"
♪ give me a sign
But it doesn't just harden you or bring out the animal in you.
It can also bring out the humanity.
"♪ Do do do do do do, do do do, do do do, do do ♪"
"Oh, Gabriel."
Wait here.
Let me get my wallet.
No.
That's okay.
Oh.
"And as our instincts change, so do our actions."
And sometimes the city simply brings out what's already inside of you...
"A killer instinct... which may be scary, or may just be about survival."
But sometimes it's hard to tell the difference.
It's a bigger desk.
"No one's using it, and you would have your own computer."
And I believe I know what key you will sing in.
F-major...
You have no right to parade your ignorant assumptions...
- You told me.
- I told you nothing.
- They'll meet him when he comes.
- You don't speak of such things.
- Everyone else was.
"- Mrs. Jennings is not ""everyone""."
I like her.
She talks about things.
We never talk about things.
"If you can say nothing appropriate, limit your remarks to the weather."
Surely they have enough reeds for a Moses basket.
You know what they're saying?
"Word is, you've developed a taste for certain company."
And why not?
A man like you in his prime...
She'd be a fortunate young lady.
Marianne Dashwood would no more think of me than of you.
- Don't think of yourself so meanly.
- And all the better for her.
Besotted...
An excellent match.
- He's rich and she's handsome.
- How long have you known him?
"As long as I've been here, and I came 15 years back."
His estate is but four miles hence.
He and John are very thick.
He has no wife and children.
He had a tragic history.
He loved a ward to the family.
"No, get out."
Kuzou.
Why the hell am I being followed?
Why are you having me followed?
"I understand your anger, but while mr."
Tendo visiting we cannot take any chances.
"Hey look, you hired me."
If you don't trust me cut me lose.
I don't need some freak with a sword following me every time I take a shit.
Are you always this crude?
Only when I'm pissed off.
Only when I'm pissed off.
Then I'm sorry I pissed you off.
Oh yeah.
I think that's yours.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Christ.
Campanela's?
The yakuza's don't mess around.
How did you get these?
They sent them to you?
I think campanela wants us to know what we're up against.
I think campanela wants us to know what we're up against.
Mafia is warning us about yakuza's?
That's rich.
Maybe you're right.
I just hope our guys can bust them before they start an all out war.
"Right, what amazes me is how he got so deep, so fast."
How good is his cover story?
Convict died in solitary so we gave brand his identity.
There is no way for yakuza to found out otherwise.
So you're saying that you can't tell the difference between the highlight reel...
I can tell the difference.
"...and physically, really cheating on somebody?"
Don't say it to me like I can't tell the difference.
"Well, that's what you're saying!"
"You're saying that they,re related, then they're somehow in the same family."
"No, no."
"I'm saying you own a Jack Russell, I own a Bull Terrier."
They're both dogs.
They're both terriers.
Mine's just a little more aggressive than yours.
"I own a zebra, you own a goat."
What the hell's that have to do with cheating on your wife?
"Right, they're both animals."
Are you out of your mind?
How would you feel if your wife cheated?
Guys?
Listen to me.
Trudy's gone.
What?
What do you mean?
What?
I went to the room and all her stuff was gone.
Where do...
Where do you think she went?
Like she...
I don't know.
We had a argument at therapy.
She said she was sick of my senior citizen bullshit.
"I've been trying to keep up with her, but I'm a old ass!"
"Shane, honey, it's not your fault."
"No, it's bullshit."
- Yes we can.
She declared war on gossip girl.You brought this on us.
"That's,that's not fair."
Serena was just trying to help everybody.
What do you know about anything
Besides your label was the only one that was true.
"You mean what she said about the ""insider""?"
Are you crazy?
You're friend with Nate Archibald
You played on the soccer team.You got into Yale
You got the lead role in the school play
"You got published in ""the New Yorker """
You had sex with a teacher.
Plus you dated the most popular girl in school
And ignored the rest of us.
No.
I meant them.
You pretend not to be like us but you are... to the bone.
And you should have known better.
Thank you.
Kudos S. Way to go out with a bang.
Now what did you want to tell me before?
Oh.
It doesn't matter now.
- It just happened.
- Leave me alone.
You're not mad at me because of that.
Just like I'm not mad at you about Vanessa.
Stop telling me what I feel.
We're just doing what we always do--finding excuses.
Well...
I won't do it anymore.
Jesus Christ!
- Why didn't you guys answer the phone?
- I was online.
"Well, no more Internet when I'm not here."
I have to be able to call you.
Maybe you should buy us cell phones.
No.
Just stay off the fucking computer when I'm not here!
You can't make us stay off the computer if you're not here.
- You won't be here to keep us off it!
- It's for safety!
- How did you get home?
- I walked.
What is your dad watching?
It looks like Nickelodeon.
- Don't look at my dad.
- Sorry.
"Ifhe puts up another sign, I think we should go up there."
"I mean, what else can happen?"
Just more signs?
Signs forever?
I always thought I'd lose it with someone who was my boyfriend or something.
But this is better... 'cause it won't matter if we mess up.
And we'll be together.
But I'm trying to change!
All right.
"This song is for you, and, yes, it is a lovesong."
"Hi, Nancy Herrington."
"So this morning, if you remember, you had asked me to send you my work."
"And that was it, what you just watched."
Did you love it?
I'm just kidding.
I don't have to think.
We didn't say anything to anybody.
Not a word.
Not until we hit this barracks.
What are you looking at me for?
Lights out!
Lights out!
Lights out!
Lights out!
I suppose some jerk's gonna say I did it.
Why don't you try it one at a time?
"Now, there's a lot of folks around these days that don't believe in Santa Claus."
I always did and I always will.
"For a while, I thought the Luftwaffe had shot him down reindeer, sleigh and all."
"But no, sir."
Come the day before Christmas the Geneva man showed up with some presents for us.
"They brought us coffee, a little sugar, prunes and toothbrushes."
"And of all things, some Ping-Pong balls."
There must have been a slip-up someplace because suddenly we wound up with 2000 Ping-Pong balls.
"It seemed pretty idiotic at the time but as it turned out, those Ping-Pong balls sure came in handy."
"Oh, mother, did they come in handy!"
"Hey, Schulz."
What is this?
You must get out of your bunk.
The Geneva man is coming to inspect the--
Du lieber Gott!
How do you look.
You had a fight?
How would you like to give Frau Schulz silk stockings for Christmas?
You should go and see the doctor.
Maybe I can--
- Silk stockings.
"Oh, who am I kidding?"
It's gonna be awesome.
"Now, turn off the lights and go."
Not all the way!
Hello.
"Yeah, three..."
"Okay, normally New York is the friendliest, most affordable city in the world."
Now it's as rude and expensive as San Francisco.
Guys?
"Oh, hey, that's life once you're engaged."
"Oh, tell her, baby."
Make it hurt.
I'll be at the booth.
My panties may or may not be on when you get there.
They won't be!
"Okay, what is going on with you guys?"
It's the cuff.
It turns out that picturing me as a loser musician with a Vicodin addiction and a beat-up van
I use to steal copper wire really turns Lily's crank.
Who knew?
"Whoa, what-what happened to your wrist?"
Oh.
It's an allergic reaction.
So take it off.
"Robin, once you have a child, anything that gets you even remotely close to the possibility of sex is worth a few pus-filled blisters."
Better the sores weep than I.
"Hey, hold on."
That slut just got here.
How'd she get beer already?
Do you see a ring on that finger?
Whoa.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
And his address just came up.
Big Bad lives at 5923 Mills.
Clear here.
Clear.
Like a cave.
This guy hides out all year long.
"Well, with burns like that, he's probably sensitive to light."
And his own skin.
"I mean, look around."
There's not a mirror in sight.
This guy doesn't want any reminder of what he looks like.
There is nothing personal in here.
"Well, we said he didn't have nothing to live for."
"For a planner like Kaman, tonight's abduction was irrational."
He went on private property and took Chris Edwards with a witness present.
"Maybe he's finally starting to feel the pressure, and he's reactive."
"More than that, he's meticulous."
He'd have a plan if he got cornered.
He'd have an endgame.
"Well, he already killed the man he blames for his accident."
The other victims were slights compared to that.
And now he needs to hurt the person that hurt him the most.
The one who drives all of this.
The one who broke his heart.
"Yeah, but who the hell is that?"
I swear I won't tell anybody about this.
"Oh, God!"
Son of a bitch!
"Oh, God!"
[Sobbing]
"I'm sorry, man."
I'm so sorry.
"That interests me, he's my son."
Please come in!
"This is the gate, you know."
"If I made an ordinary gate, everyone could get in."
But here the gate is at the back.
"Please, you can get in this way."
Through here?
"If it was an ordinary gate, anyone could open it."
I'm Marcel's father.
We are the Hladkys.
If it is inconvenient... I'm the mother.
The name reminds me of someone.
He was my supervisor.
From Bratislava.
"Ladies and gentlemen, dear students!"
"We are meeting for the last time, in order to say goodbye to you."
On behalf of the school I wish to thank you for your hard work your teacher and Pioneer leader for everything they have done.
This moment is not suitable for long speeches...
Quite so.
And you don't need them.
So I wish you a pleasant party and much success in the future.
"- Katka, aren't you dancing?"
- l don't know anyone here.
Didn't you dance at your party either?
"I did, I know the people there."
Come and dance at least with me.
"- Marcel, dance!"
- l don't know how to.
Then I'm going to dance.
Why don't you dance?
"I would, if I knew how to."
You must know something.
"Yes, this afternoon there was a documentary on TV about it."
Really?
Good afternoon.
Isn't he creepy?
What does he get up to?
"Whatever he gets up to, it can't be anything good."
He's always hanging around here at this time of the day.
Do you think he's the one who steals the underwear?
It's very possible.
Look at his face.
He looks very dubious.
- Can you keep an eye on him?
- OK.
I'm close by at the moment.
A driving license?
I don't have one.
I understand.
A man nods busily and wipes off his sweat.
When he first came here.
He'd never worked before and still had a smile just like a shining apple.
He no longer has that smile and he's worn out because he can't sleep.
"By the end of this month, from the time he came here."
An ear of rice could have grown to his chest.
Above the top button of his shirt...
Aren't you the model in this magazine?
Please sign your autograph.
"Ah, I can't."
Excuse me.
Please excuse us.
RED PORNO
Are you really sure about it?
Don't you know you could make one or two million yen easily with this job.
"Let's go, Marshall.!"
Let's go.!
Marshall showed us last night they have the ability to come back.
Let's see what they can do here.
This is Nathan.
Nice pass.
Knock it down.
"Biggest lead of the game now, and the Rams fans can smell it."
Been a great run for Luther Bedford's team.
The string of upsets stops here.
- And a foul on Agee.
- he fouls out.
But hejust never quit.
hejust kept going for the basketball.
I wouldn't be surprised ifhe made the all-tournament team tonight.
- Number one!
- We're number one.!
We're still number one.
All right.
All right.
"Though they lose to Peoria Manual... they finish third in the state, the highest a Marshall team has finished since 1960."
This was a great season you had.
There is nothing sweeter than going downstate as a young person.
"I mean, the record's gonna stay there, you know."
"1991, there was a team from Marshall played."
"- You know, and you're part of that."
- Yeah.
- That's part of history.
- Ah!
"But for you seniors,you know-"
"Best wishes to all you seniors, and whatever you try to do, uh..."
"Mr. Williams and I will be around school... as we always are - to help you if you want to be helped, okay?"
Sister Marie.
Please show this young lady out.
You're sure about this?
We've got a U-boat Commander at Bowmanville.
"Now, any intel Klaus can get from him"
- will help with the big Push.
- Eyes and ears inside.
You think he'll turn just because your family took a holiday years ago?
"Well, I'm counting on your legendary powers of persuasion, Tom."
Does he even remember you?
He was a kid.
"If anything, he'll remember my boys."
What else can you tell me?
He's a good soldier.
He's got a bit of a chip on his shoulder due to the fact that his father's got him some privileges.
So he's got integrity?
"Well, that doesn't help us."
He's a pilot.
That could help.
Guys who work alone are more likely to turn.
Start there while you're still on my payroll.
You heard.
The Yanks had to go through me.
I said it was your call.
Good luck with Klaus.
Why are you following me?
"Open your mouth,"
- or I'll open it for you.
- I don't speak unless I need to.
Why are you following me?
I wanted to make sure you are who you say you are.
I can help your men.
I came to tell you that Allison has been named valedictorian.
Wonderful.
"She'll be terribly pleased, and so am I."
"She's a fine girl, bright and sensitive."
You should be very proud of her.
"Yes, I am."
"Well, that's what I came about."
"Good night, Mrs. MacKenzie."
"You are lonely here, aren't you?"
It's not the worst thing that can happen to you.
- Isn't it?
- You can learn to live by yourself.
You can get used to it.
Maybe.
But that doesn't make it the best way to live.
The best way?
What would that be?
"People meeting, talking."
"Well, in Peyton Place, two people talking is a conspiracy."
"A meeting is an assignation, and getting to know one another is a scandal."
I think you're hard on the town and hard on yourself.
"No, I'm quite all right the way I am."
What were you gonna do tonight?
Wash your hair?
Read a book?
Go to the movies alone?
"- Well, it makes time pass."
- Time shouldn't just pass.
It should be used.
I wouldn't know where to begin.
"Begin at the beginning, begin by getting out."
We need another chaperon for the dance.
Just say it.
Unless you tear that notebook up.
If it's really so important to you...
Are we going to meet tomorrow?
I don't mind...
If I ever catch you...
"Is that you, Bernau?"
Just wait!
We know it was you who made a hole in Karel's boat!
You bastard!
Me?
"It wasn't me, I swear!"
Stop that!
How dare you lie about that as well?
"It's not enough that he scares the fish away, but..."
Just leave him.
"Look there, sheep!"
"That's right, this kind is from the hillsides."
There were some especially good areas for keeping sheep in Australia and Wallachia during the second half of the 20th century.
Those aren't sheep.
I think they're cows.
Weren't the sheep kind of woolly?
- What's a sheep?
- Perhaps we should get back to our mission.
We aren't here on a school trip.
"We must adjust the program, I think."
"Watch out, a bus!"
People who live like nomads.
Mostly they came from the poor parts of the countryside.
Working under the Sun.
"So I told him, ""You'll know if she starts talking!"""
- But she needed no introduction.
"Well, yeah, but she looked so beautiful in it."
She wore it in front of you?
"Of course, but you're missing the point."
"Grandma was so happy, and I was happy because she was happy."
I don't understand why you didn't keep shopping until you found dresses in both your sizes.
"No, no, no, no, no."
I was happy because she--
But isn't that the point of mother-daughter dresses--
To get the same dress?
"Yeah, but--"
Gosh.
Who knew grandma was so selfish?
I am so glad you're my mom and not her.
"Okay, I'm done."
There's no way I'm telling her.
So I stayed in the play and just... (Clinking)
Fudged the truth a little bit.
(Frankie) Wow.
Busy night.
"I've gotta go to the bank and the cleaners, and I should probably go to the drug store, 'cause I've had this headache for, like, five days."
"It's not a throbbing, like, ""wah-wah"" headache, you know."
"It's more of a dull, constant ""eh,"""
"so I'll probably be gone 2 hours, 45 minutes."
Hey!
It's Brick's Uncle.
"I'm here for, uh, grandparents and special friends day."
You've gotta be kidding me.
"Uh, th-that was last week."
Th-they're taking a test.
Now is really not the best time.
"Oh, no, it's not the best time for me at all, but I'm here, so how does this work?"
"What, do they, uh, sing me a song, give me a cupcake or somethin'?"
... she'sdead.
The little dog is there.
"I used to go over there on Sundays, you know..."
... bringthepaper...
... coffee.
I used to bring a bag of bear claws.
That little dog used to beg in front of me for them bear claws.
I loved that little dog.
I loved that little dog.
[MARTlNEZ SPEAKS in spanish] I'm okay speaking as we are.
MEDAVOY:
"Mr. Fuentes, when we came to see you yesterday..."
... youseemednervous about Mrs. Garcia making her bail.
You told us that you and your wife don't know her very well.
"So, what are you concerned about?"
You know her a little better than you said?
"I'll tell you everything, but you can't use it to incriminate me."
I gotta ask you something.
-Do you want to have a lawyer here?
-No lawyer. I didn't do nothing wrong.
Why don't you tell us what's on your mind?
-l had relations with Mrs. Garcia.
-What kind of relations?
"You know, intimate, virile."
I couldn't help it.
She fell in love with me.
Her husband worked all day.
"He'd come home at night, drink, beat her."
"Coño, you know, she has needs."
"You're home during the day, work at night."
My wife's a good woman. I love her.
But Luisa Garcia estaba bien caliente.
Who owns the cuff link...
"And where did it go, eric?"
"We figure that out, we clear jesse, right?"
Or we sink him.
Okay.
Our forensic nurse found evidence
Of forcible sexual intercourse.
But there was no evidence of male contribution.
What does that mean?
It means that your attacker wore a condom.
None of this makes sense.
I know.
"This may be a little strange question to ask,"
"But, um..."
Do you think that tony could've had anything to do with it?
How can you even ask me that?
"Look, tony gets accused of things,"
But...
People don't know him like I do.
I'm just asking because
I was married to someone like him once.
"And, um, I know what that can do to your self-image."
It's not like that with tony and me.
"And I used to defend him, as well."
And I paid a pretty heavy price.
"If, um..."
"I mean, if you ever feel like you want to talk to someone,"
Here's my card.
"Okay, guys."
We're now in a cisco webex meeting.
Are we ready?
"Dave, is this line secure?"
That was my first job interview ever.
"I mean, I haven't gone anywhere with my life, and this is my second one."
All I have is a fake résumé filled with things that I've never even done.
"I mean, I've never even lived alone."
- How long did you live alone?
- Long enough.
Don't you think that's odd?
My entire life.
My aunts swept in the moment my dad died and you the moment I died.
You're thinking about living here.
Aren't you?
Yeah.
"Well, you hate corduroy and sleighbell slippers."
I'll stop walking in on you doing things you don't want me to know about.
Would never have happened if you wore your slippers.
- It'll be romantic.
- I'm confused.
More.
- More?
- More explanation.
How is it romantic?
You've got a job and now you're moving out?
But I didn't get a job.
I'm undercover Kitty.
"And I'm not moving out, I'm just moving next door."
It's French.
It's very first-class Parisian living.
His-and-her suites and coy midnight knocks on the door to share a lover's boudoir.
- You'll be knocking?
You can knock too.
This was not romantic for the Pie-Maker.
Yay.
"I'm not sure that is how conversation happens, Marcus."
"No, I think that is how conversation happens."
That's right.
"My God, we've got 60 years of conversational experience between us I'm sure we can come up with something."
"Okay, then."
"- So, Fiona."
- You first.
"Will, why did your wife chuck you?"
Marcus!
"No, it's okay."
It's fine.
Good question.
"I'm quite comfortable talking about it, actually."
She chucked me because she was basically going through this whole:
"""I want to find out who I am"", malarkey and thing."
"Which is selfish, considering she had a kid and all that."
And did she find out who she was?
She was a figment of my twisted imagination.
That's who she was.
"Not really, no."
"I'm not sure anyone really does, do they?"
"We know who we are, don't we?"
That's right.
You're a depressive hippie and her weirdo son.
- What are we?
- We're us.
- And what are we not?
- Sheep!
And what does a sheep go?
This was going really well.
I wondered if we'd move into Will's place or someplace new.
What type of car is yours?
I don't know why he's missing but he's alive for sure.
The Commander told me to report his death... so I could save my family Prince Daeso was holding hostage.
My family is safe now.
I'll go to Jolbon sometime soon and serve the Commander.
I'll think of a way to get you out.
Please look after yourself.
Hope you had a nice trip.
Have a seat.
I received your letter but I still can't believe it.
Is Jumong really dead?
He is.
What a pity.
I wanted to kill him myself.
Once I take overJolbon...
I'll offer his head to the Emperor and win back his trust.
Do whatever you want.
Thanks.
"The ministers wanted to attack Jolbon without your help... but instead, I shared a secret."
"Since we're in it together, you must do something for me."
What is it?
Feed my soldiers during the entire war.
You can't expect us to feed them all.
"Prince Daeso killed Jumong, which weakened Jolbon."
It's your turn to do something.
The war will be short and you won't lose any men.
You have nothing to lose.
Very well.
We'll provide your provisions.
Governor.
What is it?
Mr. Hwang is here.
Who's Mr. Hwang?
...
What you need to take is not the people's judgement.
You should receive my judgement.
If you don't want to see any additional innocent sacrifices... don't block my way.
The meeting is in two hours.
"Oh, Chief Park..."
"Before that, an important guest is going to come looking for me."
"Without a bodysearch, just send him through to me."
"Yes, Mr. President."
"Also, I want to be alone for a while."
"But, we can't do that."
"Please, Chief Park."
Since I have some things to think over by myself.
I came here to see the President.
"Yes, he told me."
He's waitng inside.
Please enter.
So you came.
There's nothing for you to do any more.
This isn't a place you should be at.
I told you already
I'll block you with my own hands.
My revenge of 28 years...
you can't block it.
The type of revenge where I have to shoot my real dad.
Do you think I could live well afterwards?
Having the woman I love point a gun at me...
Did you think it wouldn't matter to me at all?
The dad who lost a leg for me.
Having to shoot him... how would that make me feel?
If you ever thought about me even once...
I wanted you to stop.
I want her!
I want her in my life.
She is amazing.
She's not that amazing.
"Hey, help me analyze this."
"We've been out a couple times, but when I call her, she just texts me back."
"And short ones, like, ""Hey, Everett."""
"I mean, you know her really well."
Does that mean she's brushing me off?
"Hmm, what to say, what to say."
"If you ever get the opportunity to talk me up, you know, if the subject of Nobel Prizes comes up, maybe you could drop something about my nomination."
"Listen, I hear you, okay?"
But I don't think I should get involved in this.
"I really admire you, and it doesn't feel right..."
Have you ever separated twins in the womb?
No.
- Would you like to?
- Would I like to?
"I mean, it would be the opportunity of a lifetime."
Are you bribing me?
"12-hour surgery, right by my side."
"Afterwards, an interview with CNN's Sanjay Gupta."
Fine.
I'll do it.
But just so you know...
This is very wrong.
Great!
"Listen, I need you to help me compose a funny tweet to Riley."
"I want it to be clever, but not like I'm trying too hard."
Okay.
You're a horrible person.
You're a horrible person.
You always were the one to show me how.
"Back then, I couldn't do the things that i can do now."
This thing is slowly take me apart.
"Grey would be the color, if i had a heart."
Come on tell me.
"You make this all go away, you make this all go away."
"I'm down to just one thing,"
I'm starting to scare myself.
"You make this all go away, you make it all go away."
I just want something...
I just want something...
I can never have.
I can never have...
I can...
"Whoever threw that, fuck you Allright ?"
In this place it seems like such a same.
"Though it all looks different now,"
I know it's still the same.
Everywhere i look you're all i see.
Just a fading fucking reminder of... who i used to be.
Come on tell me.
"You make this all go away, you make this all go away."
"I'm down to just one thing,"
I'm starting to scare myself.
"You make this all go away, you make it all go away."
I just want something...
I just want something...
I can never have.
I just want something...
I can never have...
I can never have...
I can never have...
She's a Wraith.
Maybe so.
"But she's different, I swear to you."
Let me guess.
A Wraith with a heart of gold?
She doesn't feed.
She's never taken a human life.
How is that possible?
Please... lower your weapons and I'll explain it to you.
It's alright.
- Father.
- I won't let them hurt you.
I raised her as my own.
You live here?
Together?
"This was part of a mine, before the last culling."
"It's not much to look at, I know, but we don't have much choice."
The people of the village would not understand.
Gee!
I wonder why.
The villagers told us there was a Wraith in the forest.
"It came here in a crashed ship, ten years ago."
Ten years ago?
Ellia was just a child.
Do you really think that she could be responsible for the deaths that happened immediately after the crash?
"So you know about that, then?"
I was there.
I helped kill the survivors.
"But... when I found a young female lying unconscious, some distance from the crash,"
I couldn't bring myself to hurt her.
I brought her here to this cave to hide her from the others.
"To this day, the people of the village don't know and you must promise not to tell them."
You...think you'll be okay by yourself?
You were in a big accident today...
And your situation isn't normal either.
I'm sure you've been really shocked...
You really think you'll be okay to stay by yourself?
You seem to want to stay here by pretending to care for me...
But forget it.
Leave.
I'll make sure to get lots of sleep for you.
All he has is frozen food and carbonated drinks.
I wonder if he only eats food like this?
His build is really large.
Too big!
I don't have to go to school.
Yes...!
Oops.
I see she brought everything over for her precious body.
'Please treat it preciously'.
I won't eat it!
"You're in there, right?"
Right?
Are you really cold?
Your hand is very warm!
It must be because I was holding the coffee with that hand.
They say the temperature of the hand is the same as the temperature of the heart.
I think your hand is this warm because your heart is so warm!
I bet you're the only one who has hands this warm.
So warm.
The person who has hands this warm in this world...
There was just one person.
And here they are.
Da Ran just came home.
It's...
It...
Okay.
If I rigged the lottery... lf...
If...
"If I'm so smart, why would I let this hammerhead win half the money?"
"Well, you didn't want to."
You didn't plan on it.
But you got fired.
"Well, because of her."
"Hey, there were cables on the floor."
Somebody could have gotten killed.
They were duct taped down.
Nobody was tripping on it.
Okay.
Okay.
I told you about her.
Can we focus here?
Your plan was already in motion.
"You'd put the gizmo in the microphone, but getting fired ruined everything."
They escorted you out of the studio.
They took your security pass and you couldn't get back in.
"You had a problem, Billy."
A real dilemma.
Is that right?
Yeah.
You knew the six numbers that were going to hit.
But then what?
You were locked out of the building.
You couldn't just turn the magnet off.
You knew the same numbers were going to keep coming up night after night.
"After four or five times, somebody would have noticed."
"- um, i know, but..."
i kind of have to.
thi-- this is like the whole check.
- yeah.
"let me take -  no. no, uncle bob."
i... [sighs] i need to take care of us.
- all right.
you endorse it right here and sign it right to the dwp.
"- well, i guess that's why the power didn't get turned off last month."
[chuckles weakly] hey.
"- i'm proud of you, champ."
you're becoming quite the little man.
"uh, i-i mean big man."
"- thanks, uncle bob."
- all right.
let's get out of here.
it's christmas eve.
- so that how the electric bill was paid last month.
"- cindy, where did you come from?"
- i was just here.
i was shopping around.
so why'd you -- uh... why'd you get a job?
[chuckles]
"- i mean, the bills had to get paid somehow."
"- well, you shouldn't have to worry about that."
"- well, what's good having a big-screen tv if you can't watch it?"
- come here. [sighs] all right.
"i'm -- uh, i have to go now, so [sighs]"
- phew.
i thought for a second that maybe you actually cared about somebody other than yourself.
"- where are you going, mama?"
- [scoffs] i made a promise to someone that i-i want to keep.
"He's Mr. Yokomoto, the truant officer."
He's trying to make us go back to school.
Let's go.
That's our hideout.
When do the ghosts get here?
Don't say things like that.
This place could really scare ya.
Come on.
This is where we're gonna live when we run away from home.
"Yeah, you can't be tough if you take orders from your mom or older sister."
That's why we quit school.
"You can't be tough and educated, too."
- Tony!
- Where?
I had a contact with him.
You...
You calling on the spirits?
- She's weird.
- She's creepy.
I...
I ain't too sure I wanna meet this Tony.
"Tony, where are you?"
He's coming in again.
I can only see a light.
That's all.
Now it's... going black.
Now it's... completely gone.
He's doing that?
He's projecting a magnetic field through his reflexes as he struggles to regain consciousness.
"His output is so great, that my machines aren't even capable of measuring it."
But he's dangerous.
"Once I have control of his brain, Letha, he will only be dangerous to others."
"A couple tears, and he'll give me pretty much whatever I ask for."
There's nothing men are more afraid of than a crying woman.
Or a woman who seems disorganized and overwhelmed.
"I feel sorta bad for him, actually."
It's so easy to get what you want from him.
Don't feel bad.
"Women have it tough out there, trust me."
Most men underestimate you.
But it sounds like you are working that to your advantage already.
"Does ""P  L"" stand for profit and loss statements?"
Uh... yeah.
Good.
Then I have the right one.
What are you doing?
Giving this file to my dad.
It's funny.
You know what I've noticed?
"Some women underestimate other women, too..."
Just because they're young.
"- Bye, daddy."
"- Bye, sweetie."
See you at home.
Feelin' like a sucker?
"Yeah, I know the feeling."
"Well, that was a cheap trick... using your daughter like that."
"Oh, there's a lot of cheap tricks being played in this room."
"Now, the way I see it, I can either go through these and find all of your clients' weak spots, or... we can call it a draw and start over."
Negotiate the rest of the deal...
Mano a mano...
like real lawyers.
No cheating.
Fine.
We work together.
You talk to her.
Sounds like date night didn't go so well.
No.
You okay?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I just feel like the walls are closing in a little bit."
Yeah.
I know what you mean.
I just-
- I get this urge.
"It just flares up, you know, like I wanna get the hell out of here."
"We really need to get a place of our own, huh?"
[Chip grunts]
I'll put a call into Topher first thing.
He owes me.
"Well, he hasn't returned any of your other calls."
"Oh, it's a delicate thing."
"You know, he's probably waiting until they break ground on the hotel."
"Well, maybe you should go in there, you know, in person?"
"- Yeah, sure."
- I know you don't want to because of what happened with the store and everything.
"No, I'm glad that I got rid of the store."
"I mean, sure, I feel bad for the people who came to rely on it, but..."
"I'm sorry, what do you mean by ""everything""?"
"Nothing, I just-- no, I meant that because everything changes so quickly in Venice, you know."
- And I don't want you to be surprised.
- It's only been a couple of months.
Almost four.
I wanna go back to the way we had it.
Okay.
- [bed squeaking] - [grunting] [theme music playing]
"Yes, I could make a killing on my own land, but they had to have the other property, too."
I'd promised I could deliver.
"Oh, I made a killing, all right."
"When I tried to get Somers' option in writing, he wanted more money to cover all those checks that he was kiting, or else he'd block my sale, block it so I couldn't deliver."
"He wanted more money, then more."
"We got into a fight, and-- that's-- that's how I made my killing."
"Axel, for heaven's sake hurry up!"
"The plane won't wait, Axel."
I forgot I need another shirt.
"Here, I'll do that."
It's so nice of both of you to come and see us off.
"Ja, we send you a postcard from Copenhagen."
"And, Mr. Mason, you won't forget--"
The hospital.
Don't worry.
We'll get that land back.
And raise the money.
Mr. Hadley's already helping.
Ja.
I forget my neckties.
Here.
"Edie, you just get him outside."
We'll bring the suitcases.
"Ja, we go."
There is no fool like an old fool.
Ah.
Such a pity.
Hm?
That a man like that should have to wait all those years to get married.
Don't you agree?
You've been my legal secretary long enough to know that that's a leading question.
Here.
But what truth?
The naked truth.
You met your brother in secret 48 hours ago!
- This is false!
- Do not deny it.
It is wiser to confess.
Mr Judge will consider it.
Do you have proof of what you just said?
Absolutely.
"This medallion, Mr judge"
You recognize it?
You authorized Dollon to keep it with him in his cell.
Why didn't we find the young man's body while his sister bears the medallion today?
It's you who gave it to me!
Do not deny it!
You lie again only to save your brother.
"You know very well that if he is found and charged with these crimes, he'll get the scaffold."
It shows a little.
Doesn't it?
"I understand that it is a concern, but do not make it an obsession."
"Turn your head, Sonia."
"No one will see it, I assure you."
Your scars are invisible.
When I think about all that happened...
Forget it.
- Let's eat.
- Sir?
- What?
- What is it?
- A lady asked for you.
- Take that.
She's waiting in the park.
Don't turn on the light.
You want something to drink?
"No, no."
I'm not staying.
What are you trying to do here?
"Turn that off, please."
You think having the lights off... is gonna make everything OK?
Just let me pretend for a while.
"Pretend what, that you can't see?"
I can't see.
I can't see things that are right in front of me... and I can see things that couldn't be there.
"For all I know, it was Cuchetto on the stairs."
I saw Valerie after she died.
I saw my mother.
Want to see me cry?
Boo-hoo!
My dog got hit by a Cadillac.
Now get the fuck out of here.
Simmer down.
Is this the cross you saw?
Is it?
How about this one?
That's it.
Why didn't you tell me... about these other hallucinations you had?
Because it wouldn't make me a credible witness.
Isn't that right?
Isn't that what you're here to tell me... that I'm a nut and you're moving on?
Why do you think I assigned someone to protect you?
I can protect myself.
With what...
darkness?
I survived 20 years... without sight or a cop at my door.
Love is big gift from god.

For the...
For the first time some women in... the family has dared to run away like this.
Such a big step is impossible without the help of the household.
The cards have been printed.
What face can we show to our relatives?
Now you do need help.
"Why, you're scared to death thinking that your husband is in some way mixed up with Lita Krail or even--"
I don't know anything about it!
"So please just get out, Perry."
We-- we don't need you.
Please just get out.
"[door opens, closes]"
Any luck yet on the guy with the strawberries?
"No, not so far."
I'm checking out the license number
- and my men are checking the markets.
- What about the necktie?
"Well, there was a cleaning tab on the label and we're running it down as fast as we can."
I gave my men a head start before I reported what I had to the police.
"All right, Paul."
I want one of your men to watch that house.
- Don't leave till he gets here.
- All right.
"Oh, you heard about the Lita Krail thing."
"Shocking, isn't it?"
Very shocking.
Such a pretty creature.
"How did you hear about it, Mr. Banks?"
"Oh, the police just called a few moments ago."
Routine-- check the employer.
That sort of thing.
"I wasn't in town when Jess Devro died last year, Mr. Banks."
I still miss him.
"Best friend, you know?"
Very best.
"It happened here in the office, didn't it?"
"He was alone, working late."
–Okay.
"If someone were trying to keep her alive, how long could she survive?"
"With a tourniquet and basic medical knowledge, indefinitely."
Until he tired of his domination and control Dr Mengele experiments... and decided to squeeze the last breath out of her so he could watch.
"See, this is why you and me can't date."
Run these prints.
Get me an I.D now.
I spoke to Shane.
He said you weren't with him for about an hour last night.
Yeah.
That's right.
"I was with a private eye named, uh, Gordie Liman."
–What's he got to do with Tio and Armadillo?
–Nothing.
It's a private matter.
I'd rather it stay that way.
I'm happy to help you if you're helping me.
–Are you?
–I have been.
But I'm just about through.
I guess I'll have to figure this out on my own.
What the hell was that all about?
Nothing.
Why didn't you just leave it here and call 911?
–This dog was sniffing around it.
–So?
It's a bone.
The arm probably fell out of the Dumpster when the truck picked it up.
Call city services.
Remand the truck.
Have some unis search it.
The rest of her might still be in that truck.
"If anyone deserves tonight's Grocey, it's you."
"Oh, thank you, honey, but it's really no big deal."
You don't mean that.
Do you?
"Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Matthews."
Is Cory home yet?
Nope.
"But soon, though."
I know.
"According to tape 56, he should be home tonight."
Late tonight.
So is it okay if we wait?
"Well, actually, we were on our way out."
"That's okay, it's okay."
I'm just going to take a hot bath.
What?
There's seepage at the trailer park.
"Shawn, I'd prefer that my son's friends didn't bathe in my home when I wasn't here."
Or ever.
"Still in a bad mood, huh, Mr. M?"
What bad mood?
"Well, me and my dad noticed it when we were last at the market."
"You know, we were eating our free samples, like we always do..."
Whoa!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Sticking your own toothpicks in our turkey and steak does not make them free samples.
Fine!
We'll just take our business elsewhere.
"Now, Mr. Eric from the city, uh,"
"I'm flattered and everything, but why would a guy who's traveled back and forth across the state line be so keen on chatting up a small-town girl like me?"
Real estate developer Bernie Frazier on fostering three boys from the Newman Home...
We'll get them back.
"We'll save the home and we'll get them back, I promise."
Everybody off to practise.
"Hustle up, let's go."
Practise time.
L'll get the sticks.
"Dumped in a Dairy Queen bathroom at age five,"
Alex Gorrall was a kid without a home.
A kid without a future.
But now this unlikely hero has one shot to win the cup.
And he's done it!
Gorrall has won the cup.
"Give it up for A-train, people!"
"Nice shot, Dairy Queen."
"Dude, this is my private time."
"Yeah, well, the Newman Home knows no secrets, you know that."
"Yeah, sorry about the little dudes, man, I did all that I could."
"Hey, it's not your fault, okay?"
"Look, I called CFS."
"Bernie requested no visitors, so we can't even go see them."
I promised lan he'd be safe.
"Well, all we can do now is try and get them back."
"Wow, at least someone's excited about my plan."
"So, how are we doing on money?"
Let's take a look.
From our jobs we have $500.
That's not counting food and utilities.
"Well, Mr B's giving us free ice-time."
We still need the entry fees and gear.
"You're gonna have to get me an Easton Stealth Pro Stick, I'd be like..."

This is my little room in the house.
Isn't that just the creepiest thing ever?
"For the first few nights I was here, I came in every night and I opened the door and I was like, ""Jesus."""
"I thought there was somebody in my room, but it was just me."
"""Oh, it's just me again."""
I'm pretty sure this is the only job that I wasn't sacked from.

Could you imagine if wanted to do this at my house at home
"My mom would be, Iike, "" No way."
You're not spray-painting on my walls.
"I don't think so."""
Got my own house.
"I'm like, "" Course I'm gonna spray-paint on the wall."""

Very nice old ladies.
-Barbara!
-Harry!
Hi.
Braiding each other's hair and having heart-to-hearts.
Then why are we still here?
we've already paid the check.
Serena.
- So we'll meet afterwards for the party. - will do.
"- Good luck up there, son. i'm proud of you."
- Thanks.
It's like getting a smile from the president.
And how are you?
I'm good. and you?
"Good, good. i start my internship"
At the mayor's office next week.so that's the big news.
As for today i got my mom and my grandpa
To agree to sit together so that's something.
- And things with you and
- Blair?
"Yeah, it's over. but it's okay."
"It turns out,we just had to go through something to be sure."
Ever since it ended i can't stop thinking
About how horribly i handled everything between us.
So i just wanted to say i'm sorry.
Thanks.
It means a lot. and thanks for what you did last year.
If i hadn't taken the s.a.t.s i'd never be going to n.y.u.
Right after i get back from my
"Backpacking trip through europe, of course."
Look at us--so civilized.
Hey stop by my party tonight.
Party?
what party?
After-grad party.
I figured i'd at least do something
Listen!
Dr. Kazamaki...!
Why are you so calm?
There's no sense in fighting what's necessary.
"No way is that ""necessary""!"
Did you forget something?
He said I was done...
in two seconds.
That rotten robot!
Penalty for Ms. Hitomi...
Fifteen years ago...
Thought I'd find you here...
Don't you have work to do?
This is a part of my job.
What do you mean?
"It's fine to affirm one's position... but left to your own devices, you're the type to brood, you know."
It's true that she may have been the one who changed your destiny...
"But if she hadn't come, it might have been the end for you of everything."
"You can't help worrying, suffering."
But you have many people depending on you now.
Don't forget that.
Yes...
I guess so.
"I'll kill him, I'll kill him, I'll definitely kill him!"
"I kill him, I'll kill him..."
What are they doing in there?
--Say...!
--What!
You numbskull!
What happened in there?
I won't tell!
"But, what if something terrible is happening...?"
Why are you standing?
How does one start this engine?
I have cursed you.
You won't forget your fears until you disappear.
I cursed you.
Solomon?
What are you doing?
Whom are you sacrificing our children for?
You betrayed God.
"Pestilence, diseases and troubles are happening because of you."
Your betrayal will bring blood and sufferings to our people.
"You betrayed, you betrayed..."
"I don't know what to do, Garik."
I thought that I had one person who could help me.
But it turned out that he is dead.
"I'm alive, thank God."
Stop that!
I know that I'm ill.
You and many other people don't exist.
You're looking for reality in an unreal world.
It's like looking for God for He is the only reality.
Do you get it?
The rest is the illusion of the Creator.
"Garik, shut up!"
You're dead.
May be you died?
Maybe you were devoured by your mega-centre.
I look at your paying for your wealth.
I think I made a right decision.
"I built my own real world, my family and my life."
But I'm grateful to you.
I won't be happy without you.

How do you do?
"Well, all I can advise is don't get complacent."
- I won't.
"Asthma's a condition that can lie low for years, then out of the blue, something triggers an attack and then suddenly you're in trouble."
"Thanks for the all-clear, Doctor."
"Give my regards to your mother, David."
"- Will do, Mrs Campbell."
Thank you.
Have you given any more thought to what I've asked - about enlisting?
I just want to know whether or not they'd take me.
That's all.
"But if they say ""yes"", then that won't be all, will it?"
"Erica, I'm not going to do anything rash."
I just want to know my options.
I suppose I was hoping that the girls and me wanting you to stay with us would be the only option you'd need.
The appointment's at 3:30.
I'll be back in time for evening surgery.
David's turning into a fine young man.
- Hmm.
How did it go?
It went over really well.
Ballet is really something out in the country.
Did you dance well?
"Yes, but I wanted you to see it."
Waiter Are you ready for your meal?
"Yes, we are."
Is Father back yet?
Not yet.
I heard something unpleasant about father.
What was it?
During the war he put out an obscure book called
The Literature of the Yoshino Court.
Who told you that?
NMzu-san.
Your NMzu-san?
Yes.
"But even if he put out a book like that, they treat him as if he was a collaborator."
Let's not talk about your father.
"Ah, you came together!"
When did Shinako get here?
She got back today.
"Oh, she must be tired."
Ballet is popular these days.
They must really like it when they see it for the first time.
"But have you made up your mind, Mrs.?"
"It's going to be the studio that you use, so shall we take out those briars and put up a prefab building?"
That would be too much for us.
Leave it all to me.
I'll make a two story concrete building and put in some big windows.
"If we're going to put something up, we'll build it ourselves."
Be serious!
She's the one who used to pinch my bum on the side.
"Yes, I did."
Look out!
-I'II pinch your bum a bit more.
-See?
You know you meet a lot of people who kind of see  lik e a media perception of you.
And it's just nice coming here and spending a bit of time with people who know me.
Most important part  of having time off.
Being able to come home and see me mother me father my brother Greg.
"Lord, may Denise and Greg be united in love forever."
never had any problem going up and asking me father anything.
"The birds and the bees, the one-two-threes."
He left here as a 1 6-year-old.
He knows more about life than me really now.
I come from a very rural background.
still live in a rural background.
He's going out and seeing the world.
I can't give him advice.
He knows where he's at.
This is the fifth day he's actually been home since he left two and a half years ago for X Factor.
Yeah.
"-Hi, love."
"-Good to see you, my darling!"
How are you?
Are you all right?
Long time since I saw Louis.
I know.
I see you every day when I walk out the toilet because you're on the wall.
"Goodbye, my love."
So lovely to see you.
I'II get my earplugs then and I'II come to see your shows.
"Yeah, that'd be lovely."
Mom finding out now will destroy her.
You're in a relationship with Holly.
How long can that last if this whole thing blows up?
"We all have things at stake, Sarah."
If it's out in the open we have a chance to diffuse it.
"Saul, Rebecca's lived in this city most of her life."
It hasn't affected any of us.
Justin and Kitty don't know she exists.
That's another thing.
Justin's out of rehab.
Are we going to throw this at him?
Right.
If your mother found out we were keeping this from her...
- We've been keeping it from her.
- Before Rebecca moved back home.
Our chances of keeping this a secret from her are...
Nobody will find out if we don't tell them.
Holly's lied to Rebecca her whole life.
I don't think she's going to risk telling her now.
Come on.
Haven't we learned anything this year?
"- Tommy, you're with us, right?"
- Yeah.
Good.
Apparently you've all made up your minds.
It's settled then.
He had this one lone hair.
Like this Fu Manchu thing.
And he had this little fuzz on his upper lip.
He was so proud of it.
You're kidding.
And he called it a mustache?
"If there's nothing out there,"
It's gonna be A huge disappointment.
But I'm not gonna give up.
90 miles east of nome...
Shawn pomrenke is trying To strike gold.
At a remote spot of his own.
We made great time.
Like glass out here.
And he's not about To let any previous mishaps.
Hold him back.
I think this hunting for Treasure at the bluff.
Is gonna Finally pay off.
Everybody's always wondering.
Why I get more gold Than everybody else.
It's because I work A hell of a lot harder.
Than they do.
This summer...
I know there's a Pile of gold down there.
Mr. Gold has gambled On the bluff...
Puddles and puddles Of gold.
A coastal trench nearly A 100 miles east of town...
There it is Right there.
Where he's convinced An untapped hot spot.
Could set off The next alaskan gold rush.
"But so far, instead of gold, It's only yielded Frustration..."
Damn it!
I wanted to go.
Here we are.
Another day.
And he's feeling The heat from dad.
"A couple hundred thousand bucks In the bluff,"
And we ain't got no gold Out of it yet.
Look at that cannon!
Would you mind?
"Don't be ornery, Bill."
Let him see it.
Yankee army issue!
Where'd you get it?
"I say, where'd you get it?"
Took it off a dead Yank.
Which battle?
Battle for our hen coop!
"That's all any of them Yankees are, chicken stealers."
You hear that?
Chicken stealers!
"[conductor] Station-stop, Kingston, Kingston."
What do you think you're doing?
He didn't mean any harm.
He just can't help playing jokes on people.
I wasn't speaking to you.
Why'd you go and play a cheap Yankee trick like that?
You're right welcome to the seat.
I was just havin' a little fun.
I'll be dogged if he can't even talk like a Yankee.
"Sit down here, pint-pot, and see if you can teach me."
"[Pittenger] In spite of Campbell and Buff um, we all reached Marietta in safety and spent a restless night in the Railroad Hotel."
"With the dawn, we were ready for the big day."
Two fair days in a row.
You don't know what that sun means to us.
"What are the fine clothes for, Mr. Andrews?"
Today I'm an official of the Western and Atlantic Railroad.
"- A very high official, I hope."
"- You are the president, at least!"
It's 15 minutes till train time.
Thank you.
Don't worry.
"When I first started, I could barely hook up an I.V."
It's all muscle memory.
"You'll get it, Inez, I know you will."
I felt like an idiot.
I didn't even know what a T-pod was.
Everybody needs help with stuff.
"When you do, come find me."
Thanks.
Page me when he's out of surgery.
Will do.
- Hello.
You're back.
- Had a cancellation.
He's this way.
"I tried calling Lee's cell, but he wasn't answering."
- Is everything okay?
"- Yeah, he's doing great."
We're just waiting for them to take him up to the cath lab.
"Ooh, that sounds ominous."
"They're going to do an angioplasty, which is a procedure where we insert a catheter into a blood vessel in his leg, thread it up to his coronary artery, which is used to inflate a balloon that will open up the blockage."
Guess those cheese steaks caught up with me.
I've been telling him to eat better for years.
"Hey, you!"
"This is my... wife, Viv."
Hi.
I'm Dr. Lockhart.
- I've been treating your husband.
- Hi.
Everything's okay.
"I've got a little blockage, but they're gonna fix it."
In what way?
Never mind.
JONATHAN:
You seem to have a decent situation here.
This place is just fine.
Yeah.
You do not need to look away every time you see me.
This is your father that I saw you with earlier?
He's my uncle.
Mononcle.
Like the film.
You look sad with him.
I don't think you're saying what you think you are.
I meant to say...
"When with him, it makes you look as though you are not happy."
Oh.
I guess that's pretty much what you said the first time.
Why this is?
Your own family makes you unhappy?
I feel uncomfortable talking to you like this.
Why?
Because we don't like each other.
Or you don't like me.
It's not like that.
I mean...
"Okay, it's true that I am upset that"
"I study for years to obtain a teaching degree, and you..."
You just publish two slim novels and get a job many would murder for.
"I, however, think it is possible we could be friendly together."
You encouraged the faculty to turn on me.
Nobody likes me here.
Nobody ever talks to me.
What's next?
"Then, I struggled..."
I removed the bag and saw him pointing at me with a gun.
What do you want?
You sex maniac!
What do you want?
You seduced my wife and you wanted to accuse first?
Don't kill me...
"None of my business, I don't know how to shoot!"
"That's right, it means, someone killed Ho Chun in the dark."
"Then, Ho Foon became the scapegoat."
"The key point is, did you have any secret affair with Chun's wife?"
"Master, I haven't seen his wife at all."
How could I have secret affair with her?
Ho Chun lied.
But why was he killed?
"It's alright, the key point is... your ass."
What is this triangular mark?
A birthmark.
Birthmark?
See!
Some acnes are found.
"Not serious, Madam."
You've dropped something!
It's a domino!
Can you explain it to me?
"Master, this is a kind of custom in the prison."
"In this prison, the new comers should serve the Indians and the foreigners."
That is to store gambling tools inside the anus.
"Master, would you help me to stuff back?"
"Since you have to stuff it,"
"I've brought you a chicken leg, better store it too."
"- Yes, I have."
"In fact, I may have forgotten everything I've ever known."
"- Child, what be your name?"
- Study.
Just explain the concept one more time.
And be mocked again?
"No, thank you."
- Come on.
- Maybe we're missing something.
You go to a special shooting range.
- A skeet shooting range.
- Right.
"There's two of you, and the guy with the gun yells, 'Pull. '"
The other guy releases a clay pigeon from a machine into the air... and you try to shoot it.
"- No, I don't think we're missing anything."
- I knew it.
- You shoot pigeons?
- Clay pigeons.
"- When you hit them, does blood come out?"
- They're clay.
And why do you like to do this?
"My dad shot skeet when he was my age, and he wants to pass the tradition down."
What if you accidentally hit a real pigeon?
- Does that count?
- That's never happened.
What if a clay pigeon hits a real pigeon?
Does that count?
I've only done this once.
"If you get really good... do you move on to other animals, like clay chickens and clay sheep?"
We didn't go skeet shooting.
I made it all up.
I got to go in here.
I'll find your wife within the hour.
Bring him a phone.
I still say we should go look for them.
How?
All we know is Mike's somewhere in Miami and Schmidt's either with him or dead.
We can't just sit here.
They're out there somewhere.
Hang on.
Could be Mike.
"Is that you, brother?"
"Hey, Chuck, I need a favor."
I need some suxamethonium chloride for an interrogation I'm doing of my son-of-a-bitch boss.
"Uh, Mikey, that's not a truth serum."
That's a poison.
Did you want Schmidt to die?
Exactly.
I think it's the only way we get what we want here.
"Uh, Mike, if you're doing what I think you're doing, we're gonna need an ambulance."
"Oh, you read my mind."
How soon can you be here?
I'm at that Syrian restaurant on 12th and Bayshore.
How much time do we have?
An hour?
Sounds great.
I don't like the sound of that.
"Uh, they must be in a tight spot, because Mike's trying to get Schmidt out by faking his death."
"But with this suxamethonium chloride, five, six minutes in, you're dead for real."
Which is why we need an ambulance.
"Only problem is, we don't have an ambulance."
"Fi, when's the last time you talked to your EMT friend?"
The guy with the dimples?
It's been an hour!
Who's number one?
No one ever seen him.
But he once killed three ninjas... with a fingernail file.
Who's this?
"There's a place about two blocks up from you, it's look like a hardware store."
"If it's closed, that's only what the sign says."
"Hold on, hold on, I gotta take a piss."
Oh what else is it...
How many times you must take a piss and you gotta take a piss?
- Not every time
- Good spot here.
"Every single time I gotta take a piss, you gotta take a piss!"
"You're not supposed to look down when you pee next to another man, ok?"
- I'm not looking...
"- You're lookin' down, I saw you look down!"
- I'm looking at your face.
"- My man, why are you looking at me all?"
Dude you get me worried about you sometimes.
Don't you know pee etiquette man?
Let's hope she hurries.
What's the big deal?
!
Who's comin' over?
It's not important.
It's not like I'm asking you to tell me where you stashed that money or anything.
I'm expecting company because of something else I did.
What else did you do?
I robbed somebody.
Somebody else that's not our Boss?
Yea.
Who?
- Donnie Daffo.
- l am feeling hungry today.
I know.
"When you feel hungry, you come to my door."
"Otherwise, why would you come to me?"
What would you like to eat?
Shall I serve you the breast?
- No!
- The heart...the ears..
- No!
"- The eyes, then?"
No!
I feel like eating the brain today.
The brain?
The police has eaten away my brain.
Where from shall I serve you?
I am not talking of your brain.
I am talking of a goat's brain!
Where does the goat have brain?
"Yes, I did find a goat with a brain."
"When I was about to slaughter it, the goat pleaded not to slay him since he was appearing for S.S.C. exams."
I advised the goat against it since he had to die some day.
He didn't pay heed.
"Today, he is making rounds at the college."
How ridiculous!
What's the connection between a goat and the college?
The boys who attend college are like goats.
Sometimes they are at the mercy of a job sometimes at the mercy of a girl.
"All right, then."
"Treat me to an omlette, at least."
You will have to slog hard for that!
- Slog hard?
- Yes.
Lose half.
- Which half?
- The half you don't need.
- All right.
All right.
I'd miss you.
I'd miss you more than I can say.
Help me take this.
None on that side.
Keep going.
Let's go around this way.
Mrs. Cole?
"Watch yourself, girl."
- Mrs. Cole?
- Hmm?
- I thought you was under it.
- I was in the office.
Hmm.
"Okay, coming in from the left."
I might have to borrow clothes.
"Talk to the costumes mistress, but don't be surprised if she's tetchy."
A parachute mine took the roof off Studio Four last night and her Panzer division uniforms are ruined.
They're saying it was the worst night of bombing yet.
"Nothing left of Wimbledon, apparently."
"The props master hasn't turned up, the best boy's in hospital, and no one knows where the grip is, so we're having to make do with whatever we can get."
It's got a bit of a wobble.
Might have to lash it to the gantry.
"There'll be tears before bedtime, mark my words."
"No, you've got a bit of a wobble."
- Chick.
"Could we save that lamp till we roll, please?"
"Sorry, Mr. Hilliard."
"Jimmy, this work is making you so tense."
"Look, I've got to talk to you about work."
"Honey, you know I don't like to talk about work."
"Yeah, well I..."
"I've made a few mistakes, and, uh, I don't know really..."
"Jimmy, you don't have cancer."
No one is dying.
"Whatever it is, whatever you've done, I'm sure you'll fix it."
Now can you write that check?
"I don't want Caitlin to be late, okay?"
It's just Suki is amazing.
"It doesn't hurt at all when she's waxing you, and it's really hard to get an appointment with her."
I know.
Why don't you get a manicure?
You could come with me.
"I mean, they're not just for girls."
You go.
We'll catch up later.
Holly's having a...
Holly's having a thing.
Perfect.
"So, you tell him anything?"
"No, but if anyone asks, you're Suki."
So you didn't tell them anything.
Um...actually I told them you went to Mexico for cockfights.
"You know what, though?"
"Even if they don't believe me, they'll never look for you here."
Did you seriously bring a loofah?
What's a loofah?
"Hey, you said bring whatever was around the house."
But I meant like survival supplies like rope or muskets and not...
Kio's cucumber moisturizer.
"Well, good-bye, my puppet."
- Come on.
Keep moving.
- Fancy meeting you here.
"Why don't you come in, sit down, put your feet up?"
- Hand over those plans.
"- I've told you, I haven't got any plans."
- Talking won't get us anywhere.
- How are you?
- Let's search him.
- You've searched.
Don't you remember?
"I was down the road, my valet with me and some colored gentleman."
"Yes, we remember."
I suppose the girl didn't give you those plans just now?
That's right.
She didn't.
How did you guess?
- Oh!
We're wasting time.
"- If you insist, I'm only too glad to help."
- Never mind.
We'll take care of it.
"- No offense, old boy."
"Well, what did you intend to do with these cartridges?"
Cartridges?
"Yes, they are cartridges, aren't they?"
"I'm rather fond of shooting— Grouse shooting, to be precise."
- That's why I came down here.
- With a revolver?
"What do you expect me to bring, a fishing rod?"
I suppose you know that grouse shooting starts in August.
I hate airplanes.
I don't even know what keeps them up.
They're made out of sticks and bed sheets.
Why don't they just open up in two and drop Jimmy like a stone into water?
"That's right, Evelyn, you don't understand anything about it."
You've never done it.
You don't know why I do it.
So would you please just hold it down and let me think?
That's Capital Peak.
"Now, what's Edgar doing there?"
Easy.
Easy.
I'll give you another pill.
- You can't carry me all day.
- Don't talk with your mouth full.
"- You can't, we both know that."
- I'm not gonna carry you.
You should just leave me here.
Go on ahead and if you find somebody send them back for me.
Just when I'm getting used to you?
- You mean that?
"- Yeah, I mean that."
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to make a travois.
The thing the Indians used to use to carry stuff around in the wintertime.
Pretty smart.
"Well, a pilot's gotta be."
"Put yourself down in a field someplace, it's up to you to get yourself out."
National Guard de Havillands got out after problems with their plumbing.
Why are you here?
I didn't call you.
"- Been thinking it over, Mr Moravia."
"Um, Alan, when people win awards, aren't they usually happy?"
I was just a kid who took a summer job and kept getting promoted while I was trying to figure out what I really wanted to do with my life.
"Now it's 27 years later, and tonight, I won something."
"I won the realization that I am Alan Matthews,"
"I am 42 years old, I am a grocer."
You want to quit your job?
"Ah, I just want to take a hot bath."
You don't want to get in that tub.
It's disgusting.
"Uh, what..."
Excuse me.
Could I have my robe back?
"Hey, I'm naked under here."
Enjoy.
A motel room.
Only three hours from home.
"I should be in my room tonight, not in a motel room in the middle of nowhere, with a toilet seat that has not been sanitized for my protection."
I don't believe that paper strip for a minute.
Better?
A little.
"I told you, we just got this room so I could clean up for my date tonight."
"Eric, I've been a good brother on this trip."
"I mean, I've indulged your little whims,"
I've been very supportive.
Why're you doing this?
I'm just not ready for the summer to end yet.
"Well, I am."
"I mean, I got a girlfriend."
"I got Shawn, I got school."
I got a life waiting for me back at home.
"Yeah, you do."
"That must be nice, huh?"
What do you think you're doing?
The hour's up.
You're not leaving till every single one of these bubbles is filled in.
I thought you wanted to talk.
I...
I...
I Chang mmi.
You sure?
Because you look a little stressed.
Is it Scott?
Is it that whole thing?
I still can't believe you actually think your little Romeo and Juliet story's gonna last.
You know he's eventually just gonna run to Derek and join up with him and his little wolf pack.
"If you don't realize that, then you gotta be the stupidest bitch in this town."
"Well, other than Scott since he's a pretty stupid bitch himself."
Stop it.
Just stop!
"What are you gonna do, Allison, hmm..."
When your stupid bitch of boyfriend turns on you?
They kill your aunt.
They almost kill Lydia.
"Who do you really think's gonna be next, hmm?"
Not you.
"No, no, it can't be you, because you're in love."
"Is that what you tell yourself, hmm?"
"""Scott's different and everything's gonna work out because we're in love."""
"Well, if that's what you believe, then you're already dead."
I just...
I just hope your dad has been teaching you moves to protect yourself.
"Actually, he has."
What are you doing here?
I...
FITZGERALD:
We got horses over here!
"Hey, Bridger."
We got horses!
JIM:
What you want to do about these pigs?
FITZGERALD:
"The Lord's on our side, kid."
FITZGERALD:
"You all right there, kid?"
Your head in the right place?
I guess.
I can't help thinking about whether we did the right--
Ain't our place to wonder.
The good Lord got us on a road whether we choose it or not.
"My pop, he weren't a religious man, you know?"
"If you couldn't grow it, kill it, or eat it, he just plain old didn't believe in it."
And this one time he head on up the old Saba hills.
San Saba hills?
He joined a couple Texas Ranger buddies of his to hunt.
Pretty routine.
He done it like a hundred times before.
"Should have been a 3-day kill, but on the second day, it all went fucked."
Somehow that night he lost his buddies.
And to top it off them Comanches went and took the horses.
"So he was starving and delirious and he crawls up into this mott, this group of trees out in the middle of nowhere just sticking up in this ocean of scrub and he found religion."
"At that moment, he told me he found God."
Uh-huh.
And it turns out that God He's a squirrel.
Yeah.
"A big, old meaty one."
"""I found God,"" he used to say."
Is that a girl who could kill herself?
"This is 1 957, Sam."
An unmarried girl that got pregnant was an outcast.
Sometimes they'd end the pregnancy.
Sometimes they'd even end their own lives.
- Maybe Greg helped her do both.
- You really think he killed her?
Hilla tried to break up with Greg on the fourth.
She said they fought all night.
"She broke with him, Al, but it was too late."
She was pregnant.
He's gotta be the killer.
But you've got no proof of that.
I've got feelings.
Feelings?
That's a song.
You've got no evidence.
- You got no gun.
You got no bullet.
You got nothin'.
- I got her.
You got shadow and light flickering on a wall.
That's not Hilla.
What you're seeing is in your imagination.
"[ Sam ] She's trying to tell me something, Al."
"I don't know what it is, but she's trying to tell me something."
"[ Sam Narrating ] As much as I hate to admit it, sometimes Al's right."
Hilla was haunting me in a way even I couldn't understand.
"But I kept thinking about the road she had traveled to get here... and all she had lost along the way... to die alone, buried and forgotten, with her murderer free."
I had to be here to change that.
[ Lyle ] I told you this was a waste of time.
Not really.
"Look at her, she's a barfly that hangs out at cop bars."
"She probably heard boys in blue talking about the case over beers, so she comes down here figuring she can get something for nothing."
"She did ask for something, didn't she?"
"C'mon, what was it?"
I gave her a cigarette.
"And if you went so far as to offer her a drink, she'll say she was on the Chicago flight with OJ."
She was in the parking lot behind St Lukes.
"She saw an Oldsmobile or a Chevy, she's not sure which."
"Two guys get out, open the trunk, lift out a body, throw it in the dumpster."
- Two guys?
She can ID them?
- She didn't see their faces.
Of course not!
"She did get a partial plate, 287, she thinks."
"Oh, so she's down here looking for a partial reward?"
She's a joke.
- She knows about the white gloves.
- What?
- You got an address on this woman?
- Mm-hm.
"Take Tim, go to her apartment, find out everything you can."
"I'm gonna have a little chat with her, find out what she knows and how she knows it."
"Frank, go slow."
You see me smiling?
"Hi, I'm Frank Pembleton."
Pamela Wilgis.
It's nice to meet you.
"Nice to meet you too, Pamela."
"So, she was wearing gloves?"
"- Yeah, I seen it."
- You seen what?
When the two guys dumped her.
With each round trip to The bluff costing thousands...
Let's go ahead and get That anchor set.
Shawn can't afford To come up empty again.
Anchors away!
It's the only miles I can hike today underwater.
"So today, he's hoping to Get maximum mobility underwater."
By trying something new...
Harnessing a mini-dredge And oxygen supply to his back.
"Hopefully, we didn't come out Here, spend all this time."
And money for nothing.
"If there's gold on the claim, I'm gonna know about it today."
On the bottom.
Big boulders.
Big boulders.
Copy?
"Okay, I got you."
Copy.
How's the visibility?
Good.
Just go ahead And cut me loose.
"Okay, shawn, I've cut you loose."
That's good.
I'm working my way over here.
There's a lot.
I cut the dredge loose From the pier.
So the dredge can go away From this big boat.
And we can stay on anchor And safe.
And look how far he just Walked.
"He just walked 50, 80 feet."
"Free from any constraints,"
Shawn marches along the Seafloor At depths of over 25 feet.
Not seeing anything here.
- A first date like a game show.
- I didn't mean to lecture.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to call it a date."
It's just rare that I meet a person I can discuss these things with.
- Some pepper?
"- No, not for me."
Could you bring me a side dish of extra dressing please?
"I don't particularly like salad, I just like the dressing."
Ah.
"This twin-prime conjecture, it's interesting."
Are there still pairs like that past a million?
I can't believe you thought of that.
That is what is to be proven.
I have concert tickets next Saturday.
I was wondering if we can do this again.
- Sure.
- Great.
Terrific.
What was it you wanted to discuss about my teaching?
I have a confession to make.
That was just an excuse to meet you.
I hope you don't mind.
Mind?
I found it interesting.
"I have many questions, the first of which is, how do you get them to stay?"
Well?
- Nothing.
- What happened to your hair?
Don't ask.
- You won't be seeing him again?
- We're going out next week.
"So, he must like you."
Our torturers are very unhappy people.
They don't know what they are doing and are subjecting themselves to eternal suffering.
I'm living here and now and not elsewhere!
And God for me...
I beg your pardon.
If you don't believe in God what do you believe in?
I believe that there is God.
But he doesn't give a damn for me and my troubles!
Stop shouting!
I can't sleep.
It's time to go to sleep.
You had a rough day today.
"Solomon, your decisions frighten me."
The petitioner is right.
You're not building a road to God.
You're building a wall of fear.
Hundreds of people bow to me.
Fear is the only thing that makes them succumb to me and create something.
Piss faster!
Why are you jumping around like a drunken kangaroo?
He shoved me.
Who?
He... there he is sitting.
In black.
He is staring at me all the time.
Calm down.Tell me who is staring at you?
The man in black sitting on a toilet.
He is holding a piece of paper in his hand.
Close your eyes and touch your nose first with your right and then with your left hand.
Are you making an idiot out of me?
You do have problems.
Has it ever happened to you before?
But you will not get 20 lakhs.
You will get 50 thousand or 1 lakh.
I will get it ready in 2 days time.
- You won't do it.
- Why?
"Though people can work hard, you provide rice for Rs. 2 per kg."
And make them lazy fellows.
You give houses for the poor.
You provide employment for the youth.
You provide free electricity and loans to farmers.
"During elections, you waive the loans."
You give everything to everyone.
Why don't you care about children?
What sin have they committed?
Is it because children are not eligible to vote?
How much can we get selling this house?
To the bankers?
This house is on loan.
How much do you have in your account?
Rs. 10 lakhs.
Give me a cheque.
For what?
"I said do it, father."
Rs. 10 lakhs...?
What made you think that I will give you the money?
"Since he married my daughter, I forgave him  made him my PA."
I challenged you that I will make you fall at my feet.
What made you think that I will forgive and give you the money?
Who won?
Me or him?
To make my heart wet...
Came this drizzle of smile...
"Well, you tell me when is the right time?"
"Sharon, don't forget you owe me."
"If you need me to remind you, why, I will."
"Thank you, Sharon."
You won't regret this.
ILLEGAL FIREARMS TRACED TO SMUGGLING NETWORK
Good morning.
Okay.
"Good morning, everyone."
Let's get started.
- Shouldn't we wait for Anna?
"I got my ass up out of bed on time, now I gotta wait?"
"Well, while we're waiting, I just wanna put this out there to everyone that if we keep an open mind, there's no reason why we can't go home today."
"Excuse me, before we actually start, can I make a quick announcement?"
It's a query.
I am missing a very nice pen.
A Montblanc.
Has anyone seen it?
Is that directed at me?
- No.
Have you seen it?
No.
"- Okay, if anyone does see it,"
I would very much like it back.
It was a gift from my wife on our anniversary.
"Aw, that's so sweet."
We're deliberating a murder case and you're talking about a pen.
"This pen happens to be worth more than you make in a month, so you can go fuck yourself."
"Yeah, I'll do that."
- Charles.
He's...
Anna.
Where did he go?
I don't know.
"I said to Axel, ""Go back into the apartment."""
"I said, ""Eat something."""
"But then the phone rang, and he answered, and then he asked me to go back into the shop and not to listen."
"But he only spoke for a very short time, and then he went out."
"Who was it on the phone, Lisa?"
"He didn't want to tell me, but I know."
I know it was her.
Miss Morrow?
How do you know?
Because she called early this morning.
Carl told me.
I made him tell.
Did your brother tell you what she said on the earlier call?
Yes.
For Axel to call her at a number.
"At, uh, at Mountain 33497."
"Sorry, but the lodge is full up."
No checkouts today.
We're looking for a woman.
She was driving an expensive convertible with a man asleep in the back.
They told us at Conley Corners she stopped there about 8 a.m. asking for a room.
We do mostly vacation business.
"The woman was around 40-- very striking, silver haired."
"Now, did she, uh, stop here?"
"I sent her down to Joe's Cabins, a few hundred yards down the road."
"I guess she found a vacancy there, all right."
What makes you think so?
I've seen her car shuttling back and forth to the junction once or twice.
"Matter of fact, she went in that direction not ten minutes ago."
Toward the stores.
There's some good stuff here.
"You know, a little kid that's staying over at the motel found this medallion."
"I thought it was yours, but I see you're wearing yours."
Where did you find that?
A little kid found it in the RV.
That's not mine.
I see that.
That's Stu's.
"Well, give it back to him."
"Oh, Stu's going to be happy about this."
Look at that.
Where do you think that came from?
- I don't know--
- See the work in that?
Think anybody does anything like that these days?
You know how much that's worth?
You know what gold is these days?
You know where it's going?
[chuckles] Nobody knows where it's going.
"I'll tell ya, people are gettin' the fever for it now."
Everybody's looking for it.
"Everybody wants it, everybody's after it."
"You know, you could help me, if you would, you and Stu."
Sure.
"I got to go back over to the gulley and look around, and you guys know that country better than anybody."
"I thought maybe if you'd ride over with me and help me look around, we might come up with something."
"- Well, you want to go look around?"
- Yeah.
"Sure, that's no problem."
- The kid's at the motel?
- Yeah.
What's his name?
"Yes, Pauline."
It'll all be fine.
Have a seat first...
- I won't go back!
"- Now come, first sit down."
It's so hot...
- Won't you take off your coat!
- Yes.
Do you see that?
"What should I see, Mrs John?"
"Well, take a closer look!"
Where is the child that I'm having?
Mrs John!
"Well, it just happens that one loses a child before it's born."
But for me it's the second time and it'll always be that way...
But you were seven months pregnant!
Was I?
"No, it happened in the fourth month... quite suddenly..."
My husband had just gone on tour.
Thank God he didn't notice anything.
"Yes, and..."
"Then I wanted to adopt a child, but... the girl left..."
And since then I've played a part.
No one has noticed anything.
But why haven't you told the truth?
"Because he is a man, Pauline!"
"A handsome, strong man..."
"Because there are plenty of young things that can have a baby, like yourself!"
Because our greatest happiness would be if we were to have one...
I've always wished for one and so has he... to raise someone...
small for the future...
"Well, why do you think he's so long on the road?"
I haven't taken advantage of my employee benefits yet.
I'm entitled to 50 Euros worth of goods per month.
That includes former employees as well.
I looked into it.
Now's the perfect moment to start in with that.
They owe me 44 Euros and 10 cents now.
That costs 5 Euros and 90 cents?
That stuff is expensive.
Are these friends of yours?
Can't you see this has been blocked off!
?
"But it says, 'shopping free of charge' outside."
They haven't torn down the sign yet.
Please exit the building!
Why?
We want to go shopping!
This is the scene of a criminal investigation.
"It just doesn't work like that, if it's written on the sign..."
"Get out immediately, otherwise you'll be shot out by the task force."
Toni's dream
Can you help me with my tie?
What?
"My tie, I forgot how it works."
No.
Why don't you just ask Franz?
"Okay, okay."
It was just a question.
I just can't do it.
That's fine.
Would you come with me?
No.
Would you please leave me alone now?
"Doc, I have something to tell..."
Doctor.
Are you alright?
I suck.
I've been treating that man's nephew for so long.
But he hasn't gotten better.
"In the end, I made the wrong diagnosis."
"Talk about bad luck, having me as your doctor."
Maybe you should've gotten better sooner too.
"No one wants to waste time seeing a doctor, right?"
I am sorry.
I....
"I know I am not that good, but I try."
I'm trying my best.
Shit think of something to say to make her feel better.
What should I say?
And what the hell is wrong with me?
"Standing, eating this junk food with nitrates."
As a kid I ate so much of this I went to the hospital.
"But if eating it makes you feel better, then it's okay."
It's not standard medical practice but..
the better you feel the faster you heal.
"Shit, it rhymes."
Sounds sweet like a poem.
Am I seeing a doctor?
Actually I just realized that being a doctor is tough.
You have to say things that make patients feel better.
I feel I've been a bad patient all this time.
Feeling better?
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
You aren't busy today?
"Oh, that's good."
will you excuse me while I put on my pretty new dress?
Go ahead.
Thank you.
I understand there's to be a little card party here tonight to which we ladies are cordially not invited.
That's right.
Where--?
Where is stella?
She's out there on the porch.
I'm going to ask a favor of you in a moment.
"well, now, what's that gonna be, I wonder."
Some buttons in back.
You may enter.
How do I Iook?
You look okay.
"well, thanks."
Now the button.
"well, I can't do no more with them."
"You men with your big, clumsy fingers."
-May I have a drag on your cig?
"-Yeah, have one for yourself."
"Why, thank you."
It--
It looks like my trunk has exploded.
Me and stella was helping you unpack.
You certainly did a fast and thorough job of it.
"well, certainly looks like you raided some stylish shops in Paris, BIanche."
clothes are my passion.
How much does it cost for a string of furs like that?
"Why, these were a tribute from an admirer of mine."
He must have had a Iot of admiration.
"In my youth I excited some admiration, but look at me now."
Did you make the milk?
What the hell is going on here?
You're a humanoid!
Why do you have hair?
"My husband told me that I am the first blonde but unfortunately I am brunette, so"
"Where are you from, Sara?"
- I was born in this cabin.
"- No, that's impossible!"
Tell me the truth.
- Where are you from?
"- You're far from home, Spartan!"
"""Do you want to tell me what you do in my cabin?"""
"- He's a friend, Cage."
There is no reason for the weapon.
"With her, I'll blow your face away!"
I'm looking for a girl.
She was kidnapped by a Humanoid.
My partner said that maybe you could help me.
This is no help for the Spartans.
I do not like to waste time with Federation slag.
"Spartan, my ass!"
As I said...
I would appreciate any information you or Sara may have about the girl.
You must be five now.
"If you can not help, let's go our way again."
And we do not ask questions.
"A gun does not want to help you, son."
What if I do not want to help you?
What happens then?
Question answered?
"Rat, piece of Spartan garbage!"
You and your Indian slut can kiss me in the ass!
They're gonna lock you away.
You come here to get my statement?
Huh?
Expecting me to... say I'm innocent?
I was gonna make that boy walk.
I was gonna put him on that back road.
"Leave him to the boogeyman to rip him apart, or return him to whatever ungodly dirt he came from."
And if the road couldn't do it...
"I'd do it myself, 'cause sometimes that's just what you got to do."
"Well, you've done enough."
Ah.
"Welcome home, Wallace."
Asshole.
Ken Mersey didn't go home last night.
He's been reported missing this morning.
Boys need stupid things to do.
That's how their mamas wire them.
"Well, his mama wasn't no electrician."
Explains the dim bulb.
It's not like you to be so funny so early.
Well...
I always figured Ken Mersey liked you a whole lot more than you liked him.
Maybe he just don't want to show his face.
"He's missing, I'm worried."
"It doesn't have to be so black-and-white, Lilly."
For fuck's sake.
All I'm saying is that... maybe he's gone because he wants to be gone.
"This ain't hardly about Ken, is it?"
This is about Wallace coming back.
"Hey, do you want to take care of this?"
"Oh, Jerry, you're just aching for coffee, aren't you?"
Here.
I love cats.
I used to have two cats.
"But then I moved to this place with hardwood floors, so we had to put them down."
[Captain Boots purring]
I'm joking.
"We've done several focus groups on the show, and what I've gleaned... the blond, big-eyed girl is popular with women and older gays."
Jenna.
That's my friend Jenna.
"And the kid with the funny hair is liked by women, but you're missing men between 18 and 49."
I'm not missing them.
They're just not there.
I think I can fix that.
"So, your job is you take things that are already working, and you fix them."
That's a great job.
"Why don't we, uh..."
You're missing that third kind of heat.
I want you to think about Tracy Jordan.
"Okay, the black guy?"
The black movie star.
"I flew with him on a private jet to the Super Bowl recently, and I found him very entertaining."
"Isn't he, um... crazy?"
Tracy's had his problems in the last few years.
I am a Jedi!
I am a Jedi!
I am a Jedi!
The important thing to remember is he was never charged with a crime.
It's not illegal to fall asleep on your neighbor's roof.
Nor should it be.
Tracy Jordan is the third heat.
I don't know where we're gonna find room in the budget for a guy like Tracy Jordan.
I think I do.
What are you doing?
"And by ""champagne"" I mean wine, and by ""bottle"" I mean box."
"Uh, you know what?"
We'll take it here.
Would there happen to be a 7 Eleven Merlot?
"Max, wine in our room sounds so much better."
We can relax and focus on each other for once.
"Mm, great."
What's the room number?
Oh.
I think she means oh-six.
I don't think so.
That room is still an active crime scene.
"Stowaways, huh?"
I'll have the Coast Guard come and pick you up.
They're already coming for that guy.
I didn't wanna strip my clothes off and try to drive the boat.
It was that voodoo curse.
"Damn you, Tim!"
"Look, dude, if you're really a mentalist, you'll know that I need to get to Texas to see my boyfriend."
I can tell that you're telling the truth.
"Please, there has got to be a way we can work something out."
We'll do anything.
"Well, she will."
I'll do over the shirt stuff.
Your shirt.
If you take off that hat.
Is there anywhere in the world where I don't have to be a waitress?
Hooters?
Thanks.
I'm a cocktail waitress on the Mississippi River.
This is a worse vacation than the one with Ed Helms in it.
"Sorry, sir."
"- You're a long way from home, Ray."
"- Yes, so are you."
But I'm not the one who's been ruffling feathers.
Where did you hear that?
I got a call from Director Hendricks who heard of a Michigan senator who was responding to a call from a local mover and shaker.
Marcus Van Sciver.
Is that the guy you've been accusing of killing people?
I didn't accuse him of anything.
But this has to do with that local cop that you've been chasing.
"Starts there, I don't know where it's gonna end."
"It's gonna end right here, Ray."
Right here.
"It's time to fold up the tent, people are tired of the sideshow, Ray."
You're asking for my gun?
Do I have to ask?
- Do you have a spare?
- No.
I'm gonna believe that.
Is there something else?
What?
Van Sciver isn't human.
"Ok Ray, I've gonna get..."
"No, you have to believe me, I've seen things."
- I don't buy this...
"- No, listen to me!"
There's a conspiracy here.
And it goes way back.
"I, I'm not sure who it involves, but these... these people, these things..."
"Hey, I'm gonna make you promise, hey look at me, look at me in my eyes!"
"We're gonna go home, you're gonna get to talk to..."
I'm not talking to another doctor!
Talk to Hendricks.
- He's a saint.
sublime.
He'II even stay that way if you don't marry him.
"Yes, well, there's no danger of that."
The count won't divorce me.
"Since I Ieft him, he won't even allow me to see the children."
"well, now you've begun a new family."
"still, I prefer to be married."
I know you thumb your nose at all that.
It's funny.
I thought I'd die of suffocation when I was married.
Now it's my freedom that's killing me.
(baby cries)
Sophie!
"tell me, have you been invited to Angers next week?"
The Duke and Duchess d'Antan have asked us to their estate.
(baby screams)
Sophie!
Where is that wretch?
Excuse me.
Franz?
I will see you.
You're not going to Angers too?
Eugene!
A whole fortnight among some tiresome old aristocrats.
"A fortnight of free food, exquisite scenery and no bills."
And all you have to be is brilliant at dinner.
She doesn't seem bothered she's being eaten alive.
No.
"She'd probably say ""Better to feel something than nothing."""
Even if it's teeth.
(piano being played)
"Do not break glass and kill the bee, you guys have... kill it... kill or i will give you a slap under you ear."
"Sir, she is gone..."
Chandu do something.
See the diamond's worth is 200000000/- it will be gone with the car.
Now every thing is in God's hand.
God...
"God... do something, anything... excuse me."
You?
You?
Both of you are here you should be shame of yourself.
You killed that sweet and innocent Laxmi Narayan and fled?
Having the punishment for that same sin.
Actually we thought he is the Laxmi Narayan who was about to buy car.
But he was not that Laxmi Narayan.
Which car?
"A green old broken car, couldn't sale even 7 months."
"If it could not sale for two day more, that would be nice."
Are you talking about 6121?
"Yeah, how you know?"
That's my car.
I will transfer all the balance to AMI 200000000/-!
"If you will take 75°/°, that would be good too."
All right give the 5°/°.
"In 1000000/- really, paper are ready too."
And Laxmi Narayan would be on his way at 4 o'clock with money.
Here's the 50°/° from advance.
"Its not nursery now, i have changed my mind, i don't want to sale my car."
Here's the car's papers read it.
I don't want to sale my car!
I am taking this car.
That's my car.
"I made it car, see this, i have made the headlights, and the paint too."
You can't just give your sperm to two girls you met in a cafe.
I met you in a cafe.
I just feel like you shouldn't be doing this.
The world is overpopulated.
You know there's an island of plastic the size of Texas in the pacific.
"I know, Leah."
You told me this 1000 times.
Please don't dismiss what I'm saying.
Overpopulation is important to me.
"Look, I don't think that me giving these lesbians one illegitimate child is gonna add that much plastic."
You have two children.
Why can't I have one?
But you haven't thought this through.
You don't listen to me.
I do listen.
I've heard everything you've said.
Really?
You don't listen listen.
I want you to go for therapy.
"Oh, God."
I'll trade you therapy for sex.
It's been almost three weeks.
I think it's sweet you know how long it's been.
Let's get a drink.
- Keep an eye out for Jarmusch.
- There's a lot of good-looking women... much better than at book parties.
Goodbye.
- White wine?
- Yeah.
Why is it wherever I go I look for Suzanne?
Because your heart's broken.
You're looking for the piece that is her to put it back together.
These people can make putting on your pants seem like a criminal conspiracy.
Forget it.
You had to be in the room to understand.
Okay.
Sorry.
- Did something happen in this room?
- l just told you what happened.
"I know, but you sounded like you were afraid, like something happened."
I don't know if you're afraid you can't tell me or that you have to protect me.
"I mean, I just..."
- l don't know what I'm saying.
"- You know that I'm with you, right?"
"I mean, God forbid you were to get indicted or, worst-case scenario..."
"- l don't know, that..."
- Say it.
- Say what?
- Go ahead.
Say it.
"Worst-case scenario, I go to prison."
- That's not what I'm saying.
- That is what you were saying.
- Am I going to prison?
- You're not.
"If I am, then how does that affect you and your kids"
- and whether you marry me or not?
- No.
I would think about it too.
"You should be, because I sure am."
You're scaring me now.
I don't want to talk to you when you're like this.
"It's okay. I... I feel like I should go home, anyway."
- l don't think you should.
I'm too small for Twister.
And roller coasters.
And sitting with my feet on the floor.
"Hope you enjoyed the prenatal cigarettes, Mom."
"Hey, you know, my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me, and I turned out just fine."
"Hey, look, I have peach schnapps."
Thank God.
"Guys, something happened."
What's wrong?
I think a boy likes me.
"""Hi."
It's Stuart.
"""We met at the comic book store."
"""I was wondering if you'd like"
"""to get coffee sometime."
"""It's okay if you say no."
"""It might be the kick in the pants I need to start taking Zoloft."""
"Amy, little vixen."
Just working it under all those layers of wool and polyester.
What are you going to do?
Doesn't he know you have a boyfriend?
"Oh, she doesn't have a boyfriend;"
she has a Sheldon.
So do you like Stuart?
I don't know.
He's nice.
He's funny.
"He has the sallow, drawn countenance associated with an overactive thyroid gland."
That's kind of hot.
"Okay, look, sweetie, we all love Sheldon, but you've been with him over a year now."
"If it's not going anywhere, what does it hurt to look around?"
"Well, yeah, I guess they're not engaged like me and Howie."
No.
You said he'd missed his tram.
No.
"You did, Mr Kirkby."
We had a whole conversation about it.
I might have been hallucinating.
Hallucinating?
From shellshock.
Do you suffer from shellshock?
Occasionally.
I can't let you back in.
I know.
She's stuck in there with that idiot.
I want to rescue her.
I want to run away with her.
Does SHE know that?
Probably not.
"The whole thing's been a series of half-cocked blunders, of which me shoving him in the chest and failing to give him a cactus is the last in a long line."
"Well, she's only on the first floor."
Doesn't matter what floor she's on if you can't let me back in.
"Of course, if you were to rush past me, grab a decorator's ladder and put it up against her window, there wouldn't be much I could do about it."
Wouldn't there?
I'm not very quick on my pins.
I don't have the full complement.
Caught a packet in the first lot.
Sniper.
Vimy Ridge.
"Go on, chump."
Oh...
"Can you hold the door, love?"
"On your signal, Lionel."
Have you seen a gentleman?
What is it?
Lady Yuhwa requests your audience.
A terrible rumor about Jumong is spreading through the Palace.
Have you heard it?
Have you?
I think something bad has happened to Jumong.
Something bad?
What's that?
From what I've heard...
I think Jumong is dead.
Yuhwa.
I don't buy it.
"But if you say so, I'll gladly check his corpse."
I'll let go of all the hard feelings if you let me and Yesoya leave.
Yuhwa.
You won't need hostages now thatJumong's dead.
Let us go.
I can't.
Your Majesty.
Jolbon will turn into a battlefield the minute the Han and Puyo attack.
"If you go now, I can't guarantee your safety."
I know how you feel but I can't send you to your death.
Do you really know how I feel?
Do you know what it feels like to hear of your son's death?
I'm just as sad as you are.
I tried to sever my ties with him but he's still my son.
I'll protect you and Yesoya.
I'll raise Yuri to make up for it.
If you really thought of Jumong as your son... then you wouldn't dare wage war against the Damul Army.
Please.
Stop deceiving yourself.
"You say you're protecting me, but you're making my life a living hell."
Here he is.
He waded in the water to help someone out.
He was helping them onto the boat-- they're here.
They made it home.
But he took a bullet.
"It came out of I don't know where, and..."
"He was as near to me as you are, and I saw the light go out of his eyes."
"But I said I'd bring him back, and I brought him back, even though it meant taking up space that could have been used by someone else."
Here he is.
Edith:
Dead?
Foyle:
Yes.
I'm very sorry.
But why?
He weren't a soldier.
The war was nothing to do with him.
Why did he have to go?
"Well, he believed it was right."
"Edith, whatever Margaret Ellis has told you, there isn't going to be a German invasion now, not today, not tomorrow, perhaps not ever."
How did she frighten you into cutting the wires?
She didn't.
What did she say was going to happen to you when the Germans came?
Nothing.
"She knew, didn't she?"
She knew that your grandmother is Jewish?
She said I wouldn't be allowed to work anymore.
She said I'd be put in a camp...
[Sobbing]
"That she wanted to look after me, but first, I'd have to prove myself..."
Do something to show I was on her side.
I didn't think it would matter that much.
That's all right.
"It's just that I've broken down just down the road and, well, wouldn't you know it, the bloody mobile."
Would you mind if I borrowed your phone to call the AA?
Erm...you'll have to tell me where I am.
Of course.
Come inside.
Thank you.
You're an absolute angel.
Last number to call the house and last number dialled.
How was she?
What's that mean?
Did she seem suspicious or anything?
?
A bit trusting.
"I wouldn't let anybody into my house, whatever their sob story."
That's cos you're a hardfaced bitch.
Sorry.
While you steal credit cards from lonely and vulnerable women.
Just a moment of madness?
"No, that was just a cheap whore in a bar."
"Well, don't be too hard on yourself."
"It had been a while, hadn't it?"
Which showed.
"Sorry, guys."
"I'd advise you two to get a room, but it seems you already have."
"Shut up, Calum."
Now sit nice and try not to lick the windows.
Hello?
Is that the Long Bay Hotel?
"Can you put me through to Iain Risdale, please?"
- Yeah.
"Yeah, that's him."
Don't eat the pie.
You'll never leave.
Where is he?
"Oh, His Royal Highness?"
I believe he's holding court over there.
Eric.
Dad!
Hey!
"Dad, these are the guys, and this is Irene."
Hi.
"Nice to meet you, Irene."
Guys.
"Uh, Eric, your mother and I decided that you were responsible enough to take your brother on the road for two months."
"Now, is this the way you thank us?"
I was going to call you in the morning and let you know my plans.
I'll tell you your plans.
You're going to get in your car and follow me home without stopping anywhere.
Now.
Come on.
"Um, actually, I'd rather stay here with Irene and the guys."
Maybe we better do this in private.
"So, there's a lot of opportunity for a guy like me in this town?"
"Well, I could use a nurse."
"Now, why don't you tell me what this is really about?"
I don't think you'd understand.
Try me.
I don't see the point in going back home.
Why not?
"Because there's nothing there for me, Dad."
"I mean, I went to nursery school, grammar school, high school, for what?"
"I mean, I didn't get into college."
"Everything I've done up until now has been a waste, and it's just too late to change who I am."
"- Oh, return address."
Exactly why did you take this?
Habit.
Just habit.
"You stuck your hand in the wrong cookie jar, little girl."
The price of being with my husband will be insanity and death.
I hope it was worth it.
Bad Fae.
Stupid girl.
Someone should have told you never to cross a Fury.
Get out of my head.
This is nothing.
I'm gonna sear your mind beyond repair.
Let's turn up the heat.
- Let's go.
- My bag.
"Call the grease monkeys, man."
I can smell brain oil burning down the hall.
"Tong says break some cases, I'll break some cases."
Yeah.
You know the surefire way to convince a therapist that you need help?
No?
Show up to your first appointment late.
Therapy is bullshit.
Human bullshit.
"If you don't play ball, you're gonna end up one castrated cop which means you're useless to our side."
Go to your session.
How's the head?
Achy.
I don't really remember what happened.
Can you just put that down?
"- And where did you get that, anyway?"
I'm out of it.
- I can get us past the lock.
- So can I.
After me.
Whoa!
- Bluestone!
- Help!
(crash)
(groans)
Now that's what I call an entrance.
Who's there?
What is this?
I want answers!
"So do we, gargoyle."
So do we.
(banging)
- Why didn't you use the key I gave you?
- I lost it on the way down!
Why didn't you warn me about that blasted chute?
Any advance hesitation on your part might have made the gargoyle suspicious.
But you played your part well.
Now the fun begins.
(Malone) Welcome to the Hotel Cabal.
(Matt) That brings us to where we left off.
It's going to be a bumpy night.
I'm sure you've noticed by now this is no ordinary hotel.
The Cabal is designed to decimate one's grip on reality.
"Once your defenses are down, we step in and strip your mind of its most precious memories and darkest secrets."
"By the time a guest leaves here, he's little more than a mindless cretin."
Funny how the least little thing sets him off.
I know what you're thinking - open window.
Too good to be true.
And I just couldn't handle it going down like that again.
You really like me?
I'm crazy about you.
"Well, I like hearing that... because I love you."
What?
But we never even...
You know.
"But we've talked on the phone every night for, like, a month, and I love talking to you."
I love hearing what you have to say about everything.
And I don't want to rush the other stuff if it means you're gonna freak out.
Because I want this to be something.
"So I'm fine with waiting, okay?"
"Just, no more chili cheese fries."
- They smell disgusting.
- Deal.
They say that the hallmark of a good negotiation is when neither side is particularly happy.
"Well, then this was a very good negotiation."
My people will hate this deal.
Yep.
"Mine, too."
"You didn't need to pull that whole ""helpless"" act on me, you know?"
"Sure, you say that now."
Seriously.
"I mean, you're a killer negotiator."
You don't need tricks.
You've got skills.
Hmm.
You're not too bad yourself.
"Oh, a word of advice, though..."
- I'd keep an eye on that daughter of yours.
- Are you kidding?
I've completely given up on that one.
"Yeah, that's a bite mark, all right."
"What do you have to say about that, maestro?"
Gillian must have given me a love bite.
I spent the night with her Sunday.
"Yeah, she told us that."
She also said that you both fell asleep fully clothed.
We had rather a lot to drink.
I took my usual sleeping pill.
My recollection is a little fuzzy.
That's cold.
Teeth marks look bigger than Laura's.
"Well, that happens when there's some swelling of the bite wound."
There.
I'll get the odontologist to confirm.
But it's a match with Laura.
"He clenched her in a bear hug and... lifted her up into the air shaft, her head would have been over his shoulder."
It's consistent with a bite sustained during a struggle.
I hear the fat lady warming up.
"Me, a suspect."
- How outrageous is that?
- I'm sure it's a mistake.
It's done.
You're perfect.
"I'm all bark, Gillian."
You know I wouldn't hurt anyone.
That's the last thing I would want to think.
"But truthfully, Philip, I..."
I don't remember biting you.
You know how much we had to drink.
I just wanted to numb myself.
"Yes, yes, I'm coming!"
Mr. Reinhardt... put your hands on the piano.
-How's it going?
"I'm okay, thank you, ish."
How are you?
"Yeah, good."
Yeah.
"So is that right, your mum's been sent to prison?"
"Like, what was it?"
Charges of fraud and gross malfeasance.
-Sounds as if you know all about it.
"-And so she's, like, banged up in there with all those slags and ratbags, like in Bad Girls?"
-It's not quite like that actually in real life.
"-I know, but...."
"Well, she's a pretty major criminal though, yeah?"
-She have to wear one of those uniforms?
"-Yeah, with all the arrows all over it."
Yeah!
"So, what are you doing this afternoon 'cause we're just hanging out?"
"Yeah, I mean, do you fancy coffee?"
"Yeah, of course."
"No, of course I want you to."
It's just I can't make tomorrow or Saturday.
That's all.
How about Sunday?
No.
"No, that would be perfect."
"Oh, my gosh, you'll never guess...."
"There's no question it's been the making of her, this whole business with her mother."
Seems to have turned her into a major celebrity overnight.
I know.
She's got five dates so far on the strength of it to my certain knowledge.
"Kids, I don't know."
Another world.
Almost never happens.
You know that almost never happens.
"- Hey, where's garrity?"
- He's got the flu.'
"Missing black shawn, now we're missing white shawn."
We're 2 shawns down.
We had to take him to the hospital.White shawn.
- For the flu?
"- He was pissing blood, dude."
"Nah, nah, you don't piss blood when you got the flu."
You piss blood when you got something like gonorrhea.
You do?
Me?
"No.No, no, no."
I never have.
"That's what I heard happens to people who have gonorrhea, which I've never had.Obviously."
I think he had gonorrhea.
"Once, ok."
"Jesus, just once."
One and a half times.
The second time doesn't count because I was just a carrier.
"- Dude, that was awesome."
"- Ahh, we did all right."
"The engine had a dry hydrant which delayed our primary searches, which is why the chief had to call a second alarm.but, most of the apartments above were vacant, which is why we didn't find any roasts."
- Roasts?
- Dead guys.
"Oh, yeah, roasts."
"Hey, let me get in there, you know, check out the damage."
"No, I don't think so."
"Oh, come on, mike."
Let me in there.
"I mean, the stimulator at school, it's for pussies."
What we get is just the leftovers.
"If we don't get even that now, should we beg?"
Look!
I'm the one who gets directly involved.
I'm the one who takes the maximum risk.
You and him...
You will not get caught for sure.
If I get caught...
I'm done.
Don't cry like a kid.
Go and see what needs to be done.
"If Vasundhara gets to know, we will get into trouble."
The chances of her knowing are very low.
She is with Manoj now.
She will not search for us.
This is the only opportunity we will get.
If we continue like this...
She will treat us like dogs forever.
We can't gain anything from being like that.
Don't think too much.
I have planned everything.
"Talk your girl, Divya."
She has to come.
She must not disclose these details to anyone.
Got it?
Where were you?
You weren't in Kanyakumari for the past 2 days...
"Since we had no work here, we had gone to Kerala."
What is your Manoj saying?
"You left me alone with him, and went on a vacation?"
"You said that if we lure Manoj with money and wealth, we can easily trap him."
He is least bothered about it.
That's not dumb.
That's cute.
"Look, I don't know who my dad is."
And...
"If I stop believing that anything is possible, it feels like I'm shutting the door on ever meeting him."
Can I stop making this face?
'Cause I feel like I'm gonna cry.
"Well, your crying face is dumb, too, so go ahead."
I'll end it with Everett.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Just curious.
Why Egypt?
I figure it's so far away that no one will ever follow me there.
"Seriously, you know Riley Elliott?"
Yeah.
We dated for six months.
"We're on a break right now, but you never know."
Hmm.
You've blocked my entire life's work!
You ruined my career!
Whoa.
"I just think that you have some incredible skills, Mary, and I would love to see you channel those talents into something good."
Oh.
"For your information,"
I have done a lot of good!
Did you know that I was the number one download for Operation Desert Freedom?
What have you ever done for our troops?
I was really nice to one in an airport shuttle one time.
"Okay, if you want to help me, Aaron, then just let me be who I am."
Accept me for who I am.
Not a lot of people in my life have done that.
I just want a mate.
You just want to mate?
!
I just want a mate.
"You're not mating with me, sunshine!"
"A mate, I want a mate."
"Well, just as well, because I'm not having any of that nonsense."
"I mean, you're just a long streak of nothing, you know, alien nothing."
"There we are, then."
Okay.
I think the pair of them together were pretty amazing.
It proves that you don't need to have romantic tension to have a male and a female character with a dynamic relationship.
"Oh, ha ha!"
That's just -- car keys.
What?
I've still got my mum's car keys.
I won't be a minute.
"Donna's end, as a companion, broke my house."
My wife and I were just inconsolable.
"She basically becomes a Time Lord herself, but, because she's physically human, she can't handle it and her brain's going to burn and the Doctor has to wipe her memory of everything they've done together."
Don't make me go back.
"Doctor, please, please, don't make me go back!"
Donna.
"Oh, Donna Noble, I am so sorry."
But we had the best of times.
The best.
Goodbye.
"No, no, no, please."
"Please, no, no."
No!
No!
She was a receptionist.
What would she have?
Seriously.
That ajumma knows how to subtly put on airs.
Yeah.
Unni Jin Ok can't come today?
Why?
She was scammed?
You want me to h-hold it?
The rumors are already spread all over this place that I was scammed by con artists.
I'm so embarrassed that I can't even face anyone.
"Jang Jin Ok, the name that used to have influence everywhere I went, it's become so that I can't use it anywhere now!"
Then... simply change your name.
It only takes a week.
Do you really want to die!
No.
I have to be cool-headed about this.
I-I heave to be cool-headed about this.
Here.
Take this.
Ok.
Then what should we do now?
We should catch them.
That's right.
No amount of money is too large.
Catch them.
"After screwing up my good son's life, and making me this embarrassed."
My husband is getting a tax audit...
I mean... can he persecute us like this just because we have money?
Of course not.
"Make sure to catch them, especially the punk who pretended to be a prosecutor, make sure to catch him."
"Even if you have to kill him, catch him."
Ah!
And a murder.
And a murder.
Thank you.
And the murder of Amanda Holden.
Rumour on the street is you had beef with Mayor Cowell.
"I have no gripe with anyone, Sleet."
The world and time are linear to me.
I see and hear all things the world chooses to show me.
Look at this one.
Hmm.
"Now, young one, you're obviously not at one with this world yet and that is OK, but listen, let me help you."
"Because deep within all of us is a spirit animal, a spiritual guide."
"Now, most people don't allow this animal to take control, but you must."
Mm-hmm.
"Now my animal is a panther, strong, sleek, unafraid."
His...
Mine is a curious goat.
That was it.
That's nice.
"Well, you know, it's all right, I'm slightly ashamed of it."
You must never be ashamed of your spirit animal.
"Yeah, but it's easy for you to say, you're a panther."
Why did you pick a goat?
"You don't choose your spirit animal, it chooses you."
"Yes, of course."
"We're going to find yours, Dermot."
Are you ready?
Yeah.
Shut your eyes.
Now clear that little mind of yours.
"Now, I want you to think of the second animal that comes into your head, not the first one, but the second one."
Pussycat.
Here we are.
Till death do us part.
Of course the security guard didn't see me.
I was asleep on the sofa.
"Are you sure that's where you were, Tom?"
You didn't go home instead?
Get into an argument?
No.
But she was angry with you?
We were happy.
Didn't stop you playing away though?
I wouldn't.
I loved her.
"You loved her so much, you had to change the bed sheets?"
You know where that bed sheet is now?
It's in our lab being tested.
"What are they gonna find, Tom?"
A loving fiance or a cheating liar?
Guv wants a word.
Interview suspended at 9:50.
Greenwich just called.
A woman's been attacked outside her flat by a minicab driver.
You think there's a link?
Victim is a temp at the forensic service lab where Kelly worked.
I was working late.
So I didn't want to risk the walk to the tube.
And there was this minicab parked up right near where I work.
He said he'd just dropped someone off.
Can you remember the name of the cab company?
"No, I'm sorry."
"He took you back to your place, yeah?"
I was halfway down the steps to my flat before I realised he was behind me.
"They say to him, ""What's the matter?"
"Don't you say anything?"""
"He says, ""What am I going to say, that my wife two-times me?"""
"So she says, ""Shut up!"
"You're always talking! """
"But in Italian, it sounds much nicer."
-Cornuto contento.
-That's it.
It means he's content to be a jerk.
He doesn't care who knows it.
Did Tommy ever tell you about my painting?
Look at this.
It's beautiful.
I like this one...one dog goes one way and the other dog goes the other way.
"One's going east, and the other one's going west."
So what?
"And this guy's saying, ""What do you want from me?"" The guy's got a nice head of white hair."
Beautiful.
The dog looks the same.
Looks like somebody we know.
Without the beard?
"No, it's him."
It's him.
What the fuck is that?
"For most of the guys, killings got to be accepted."
Murder was the only way that everybody stayed in line.
"You got out of line, you got whacked."
Everybody knew the rules.
"But sometimes, even if people didn't get out of line, they got whacked."
Hits became a habit.
"Guys would get into arguements over nothing and before you knew it, one of them was dead."
They were shooting each other all the time.
"Charlie, we sleep ass to ass, you know that."
"Oh, great."
"Okay, clearly, we're having a problem with honesty here."
"Dennis, a word."
"I hate to say it, bro, but I think we're gonna have to do an overnight observation."
"Yeah, well, to be honest with you, I wouldn't mind seeing how this whole situation really works."
Fascinating.
"Well, this just gets weirder and weirder, man."
Anything?
Nothing.
False alarm.
"Damn it, dude, we can't keep doing this all night."
"Oh, I know."
You know what.
Why don't we sleep in shifts?
"Yeah, I mean, I'm not saying this isn't important work"
- but I can't keep my eyes open.
"- No, I hear you."
I hear you.
I hear you.
"All right, I'll tell you what."
You go ahead and go first.
I still got a little energy left.
"I don't know about this floor, Dennis."
It's covered in sand or something.
No.
"It smells like some kind of spice blend or pesticide, or some other kind of sandy poison or something."
I don't know.
"I wouldn't sleep on the floor, though."
- You got to sleep with them?
"- You got to, you got to."
You sure you're all right?
You will see her in time.
"What's up, Connie?"
Everything okay?
Did you just call John?
I've been asleep since 9:00.
"Unless, of course, you're Gordon Smallwood."
See?
"It's sticking up here around 1,950 cycles per second."
"But it never gets any lower than maybe 1,930 or so."
"But yours is way down here in the normal vocal range... anywhere between 1,000 and 1,200 cycles per second."
"Okay, so this guy's vocal range is much higher than mine."
What makes you think it's a man?
"Still more proof, John Klein?"
What is it?
"Near as I can tell, it's... an electrical impulse."
"But whatever it is, it's not coming from human vocal cords."
"Why ask me what you already know, John?"
What happened to my wife?
You were there.
Mary Klein cannot be found by looking.
You will see her in time.
This isn't like you.
We used to rip on this stuff. when it came over the wire.
"Yeah, I know."
- It's different when it happens to you.
- Do me a favor.
Talk to Cyrus today.
Tell him you got the flu.
Any excuse.
I'll back you up.
I just wanna make sure you still got a job... when you're done doing whatever it is you're doing down there.
"Okay, I'll call you from Chicago."
"Oh, okay, fine!"
"Well, then why don't we wait closer to the exit?"
"Because if it looks like we planned our escape, they'll know it was a setup, and Mike dies."
W-what if we die?
!
"I mean, has anyone thought about that?"
!
"Yes, which is why you need to stop talking!"
"Just get ready, 'cause at any moment, they're gonna show --"
They're in the warehouse!
"Schmidt, get out here!"
They caught us by surprise!
Can we leave now?
!
"Dude, if we're gonna sell this, you got to put up a fight, okay?"
Which means you need to shoot at them.
Shoot at them with your gun!
"Yeah, I think they bought it."
There's too many of them!
Let's get out of here!
"Go, go!"
"Spies will use whatever they can to get behind enemy lines -- stealth, deception, and even capture."
"A prisoner of war can learn about enemy morale, supply, and location."
"Of course, the first thing you have to do is convince your enemies you're worth more alive than dead."
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
I'm unarmed.
Hey!
Someone's here!
What is this?
Who are you?
!
I'll have to go back to work soon.
This woman isn't well.
"Benigno, please."
You know what I mean.
Her skin's really dry.
Let's see.
Here it is.
Have you talked to her?
"No, and don't go on about it."
"Goodbye, Lydia."
You have to be patient with him.
Work hard.
"""Shrinking Lover""."
Rosa's got the flu.
I hope she didn't give it to you.
I'm glad you're feeling well.
"Even so, I'll give you a massage, and a rubdown with rosemary alcohol."
"No, I'm all right."
Last night I saw a film... that disturbed me.
"It was a love story, between Aif redo, who's a bit overweight, like me, but a nice guy, and Amparo, his girlfriend, who's a scientist."
Amparo is working on an experimental diet formula that will revolutionize the world of nutrition.
You're selfish.
You only think of yourself.
I've got it!
It could be dangerous.
I still haven't tested it on humans.
Do you still think I'm selfish?
It's done wonders for you!
"Don't worry, my love!"
I'll find the antidote!
But time went by.
"Despite her efforts, Amparo couldn't find the antidote and poor Aif redo was shrinking daily."
It seemed like the perfect opportunity to show him the concivilized and educational events
ZBZ's gonna be hosting this semester.
It's gonna buy us a little good-will.
It's what good leaders do.
We are so screwed.
What are we going to do?
This's a total nightmare.
"Don't panic, I'll figure something out."
Wait!
- I need to buy your expertise.
- Plan B.
"Not yet, that's way too dressed"
"Find out where the dean lives, get about 10 gallons of gas."
"Wait, where's dean..."
Bowman!
I was looking for the punch.
It's right over there.
Do you want me to get you some?
"That's fine, I'm fully capable."
Thank you.
"Then I'd like to get myself a tour of the house, if it's alright?"
Of course!
I told the girls I'd step down as sorority's president if we got caught.
- I have my stun gun upstairs.
- You know what?
I'll handle it.
Make sure
Bowman and Lizzi stay away from the basement door.
- What you gonna do?
- I'm gonna be a sorority's president.
"Ladies, we have an emergency."
I need 8 quadro in formation
Our stock plus yours controls the voting power.
We'll give you your money on one condition:
That daniel drew is voted out of the erie railroad!
I won't stand that!
You can't do that to me!
We've got to have order here!
"If we're going to come to an agreement, we've got to conduct this meeting in parliamentary fashion."
"Now, all in favor of the basis of settlement as stated by the general- er, colonel-er, well, fisk here-say aye."
Aye!
Aye!
"All opposed, no."
"No, cornele, no!"
The ayes have it.
"Drew, you're a dead goose."
You're out!
You-
jim!
What?
"Say, you're just in time."
Take a look at this rehearsal.
It'll cheer you up.
Take a look at this.
It'll cheer you up.
"What, the stockholders on the warpath?"
What do you expect me to do?
Put on sackcloth and ashes?
"Now, see here, jim, what's got into you?"
We're in for trouble because these fellas mean business.
They're trying to have you indicted for buying this opera house with erie funds.
"Aw, cool off and take a look at the birdies."
"Now, wait a minute, jim."
You can't joke about this.
"That's it, thanks."
"All right, digger."
How old is he?
A little over a year.
"It can't be anything serious, can it, James?"
It's none of the usual things-- an inverted eyelid or an extra row of lashes rubbing against the eyeball.
"Sometimes, I find him lying in his basket with his eyes half-closed."
"No pain, but there's something wrong."
Nothing shows.
I suppose he might have a long-standing infection in there.
I'll give him some drops.
See how he gets on with those.
"All right, digger."
"Apart from his eyes, he's fit as a fiddle."
Marvelous company when I'm traveling about.
"Get through the work like lighting, don't we, boy?"
"Changed my whole life, this little chap."
Digger.
"Don't worry, Andrew, most of our patients feel that way about the surgery."
Even our own dogs avoid it like the plague.
There we are.
"Thank you, James."
I'm sure I won't have to trouble you again.
Let's hope so.
"Come on, digger."
"Next, please!"
You're an idiot!
An idiot!
"Bad dog, very bad dog."
You're lucky I'm not scooping up the pieces.
Do you realize what a silly animal you are?
Mrs. hall!
"If anyone gives you drugs, take them, but do not take them."
Do you understand?
"And I will look both ways before I cross the road, and I will floss after every meal, and I'll wear a sweater just in case it gets cold."
I'll be fine.
"Well, you better be or I'm going to kick your ass."
I'll meet you back here at midnight.
I have to run an errand.
Hey.
Aww...
Did Mike stand you up?
"Vicki, if you're here to grill me again, I just..."
"Listen, Coreen's going to go undercover tonight and I need someone who can blend to the Goth scene, keep an eye on her."
I can't.
Not tonight.
"Henry, there are two men dead and I think there's going to be more."
I need your help.
"And I'm working on something that could prove to be just as dangerous,"
- for both of us.
- I know.
"That's why we should be working together, right?"
- We're supposed to be partners.
- Yes!
Just not tonight.
Okay.
Sure.
"Can't blame a girl for trying, right?"
"You know if you feel like it, we'll be at the Underground later ...you know, if it's not too much trouble."
"Christina, what do you want from me?"
I'm in.
Over.
"Aw, come on, Coreen, it's a one-way radio."
"Hey, have you heard the good news?"
- Nothing.
- Maybe we could go.
In what world would I want you to come along?
"- It's not for you, it's for us."
- It'd be funny to watch you fuck it up.
"Yeah, you might cry."
"Thanks for the vote of confidence, but you won't want to come."
I'm seeing her at this under-18s night she's working at.
"It will be uncool,"
- even for us.
- Sounds OK to me.
- At least we'll definitely get in.
"- No, no."
- You won't like it.
- We might even get some.
Won't they be a bit young?
- Grass on the pitch and it's OK for me.
"- Right, and what if there isn't?"
By the time you find out it'll be too late.
Surely you've got better things to do than watch me with Charlotte?
"Great, no, fine."
See you there then.
"So before my date with Charlotte, and it was a date,"
I had to endure one last day with the savages.
I was pleasantly surprised to find Jim and Wolfie engaged in serious debate.
"All right, Will?"
"You'll like this - we're just having ""a discussion""."
"- Oh, really?"
- Which titties would you spunk over?
"The little ones, or big and bouncy?"
"A handful, plenty to play with."
- They both look nice.
"Oh, wait."
No.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"
No!
"You have got yourself a real prize there, young lady."
"I know, mom, he's a great guy."
He's more than a great guy.
He does whatever I ask him to do and eats whatever I toss up on the roof.
It's like having a big pet raccoon that can fix stuff.
Oh.
There's my hard-working man.
"Nice fit, huh?"
Two more pockets and I'm a pool table.
"Mike, why, why are you wearing my dad's clothes?"
"Oh, I gave him a bunch of daddy's stuff."
"You know, the last time he wore this suit, we were sharing a ""j"" at a Doobie brothers concert or sharing a doobie at an O'jays concert..."
I forget.
It was the Doobie brothers.
I found the ticket stubs and an ancient tootsie roll.
"Oh, daddy loved his tootsie rolls."
Can I see it?
"Well, the real memory is the ticket stubs, right?"
I'm kind of freaking out here.
"Mike, you don't have to wear that."
Why?
I think I look pretty good in it.
"You look like you should be standing in a field, selling green beans."
"Never mind her, you look great."
"Now, why don't you sit right down here at the head of the table?"
"We're having pot roast, mashed potatoes, and your favorite dessert..."
banana cream pie.
That's not his favorite.
"MIT's on cruise control for you, you've already gotten into Harvard Med."
"I mean, what do you have to worry about?"
- How did you know that?
- I like to take an interest in my students.
"Well, I'm also really involved in the science competition."
"You know, the 2.09 Competition?"
"Wait, no."
I'm building a car that drives by itself.
"Yeah, well, it's something I've been doing with my friends for over a year, so it's kind of important."
"Ben, let the car drive by itself."
"Listen, you not only have a gifted mind, but you're also composed."
You don't give in to your emotions.
You think logically.
"Ben, you were born for this."
You'll have more fun than you've ever had in your entire life.
It's perfect.
Thank you.
But I'm really not the right guy.
So I'm sorry.
Ben.
I hope this little conversation we just had will remain private.
"- No, of..."
- No.
"You're one of my favorite new students, and I'd hate to lose you, if you know what I mean."
- I'm just not sure it's me.
- It's boring.
It's boxy.
It's blue.
How is that not you?
"So, how much is this thing gonna run me?"
"Oh, well, let's see, the belt's $49.95, minus 15%."
The jacket's $589.99.
I know your apartments are above the offices.
Maybe you still have a room there?
I would like to stay in the place during the night.
Thank you.
Say.
Does your servant live here?
"No, he is married and has children."
He goes home.
"If that's what you want to know, we'll be three in the apartment."
Sir?
Forgive me.
Thank you.
"Philippe, I no longer need you."
You can withdraw.
I really doubt something will happen.
Individuals who threaten us will surely be wary.
I guess that they already know you spend the night here.
My presence here won't prevent them from acting.
I hope that my room will please you.
"I'm sure, but..."
I'm sorry to put you out of your own room.
I did rearrange it with great care.
That I do not doubt.
"My partner got the ceiling and floor screwed, very complicated works, because the room, which was in good condition, was not to his taste."
"It is in a room that one passes half his life, doesn't it?"
It's late.
We will accompany you.
I know the way.
I insist.
"If you need something, I'm in the room in front of yours."
Thank you.
Everything is perfect.
- I don't date potential employers.
You'll have lunch and a professional conversation.
"If you consider that a date, your social life must be lame."
- It is.
- We're having a baby.
I am trying to be a good mother.
That's what he wants here.
- He has a mother.
"- But she's not here, and I am."
- Why are you leaving?
"- I've had some bad ideas in my life, but thinking I could work here and share an office with you is one of the worst."
How you doing?
"No, I work here now."
I'm not kidding.
"Hey, stud."
Hey!
Whoa.
Blind stud.
I got soap in my eye.
"Sorry, but what you did back there?"
It was incredible.
Sure it was me and not the hormones?
"Oh, it was you, all right."
"Well, I do aim to please."
Good.
Because I'm nowhere near finished with you.
I barely left the house most Sundays.
"My mom would cook elaborate dinners for neighbors, friends and sometimes people we barely knew."
"By ten, I could whip up a perfect meringue, deglaze a pan, truss a chicken."
"But by the time puberty rolled around, I'd had enough."
"Football, friends seemed more important."
So I told her I was done.
Grace was fussy all night and sometimes a car ride settles her down.
I'm gonna numb up the cuts on your face before I suture.
What am I gonna tell my husband?
"""Need a new car""?"
You're going to feel a little pinprick and then some burning before it kicks in.
You have a bunch of phone messages.
Tell Kayson to stop bothering me.
I'll call Anspaugh back when I get a chance.
"Oh, crap."
Henry's got a birthday party tomorrow.
Could you go down to that toy store on Michigan Avenue for me?
You want me to go outside?
Yeah.
It's just a few blocks.
I need a King Funshine.
I'll write it down for you.
- In the storm?
"- What, you afraid you'll melt?"
What about the lightning?
I'm a pretty big target.
"Well, then I suggest you try running in a zigzag pattern."
The results are back for that little girl who ejected from the car.
- Is she awake yet?
"- Not yet, but I'm gonna double-check."
Baby's head CT is negative.
- Just some soft tissue swelling.
- Is she awake?
"No, she's still sedated."
Then you can't follow her neuro exam.
She'll wake up and we'll extubate.
This is Bradley Anderson.
His wife and daughter were brought in.
That's a bad idea.
They're getting away!
That was close.
Bravo.
"Well done, MacGyver."
I knew you'd get us out of that mess.
I always said you're my brightest student.
I'm sorry.
You've every right to be angry with me.
I was wrong.
I was foolish to think that I could control Cleeve.
You almost got us killed!
You must believe me.
I never meant any harm to come to you or Kelly.
"The truth is, I was frightened."
I'd lost my position at the academy.
I was desperate.
"I mean, this is my last chance."
I couldn't bear the thought of losing it.
I thought you hated treasure hunters like Cleeve.
I do.
But finding the Treasure of Atlantis means more than wealth.
"It would prove that Atlantis really did exist and there were times when people didn't live by war and conquest, but worshiped peace and knowledge."
"And if we were like that once, maybe we can be like that again."
It's a nice dream.
I'm convinced that it can become a reality.
"It's a wonderful dream, professor."
But did it ever occur to you that Cleeve might have other plans for the treasure?
Do you think he and Zavros will come after us?
Yes.
"Yes, I do."
The Tower of Fear.
"- All right, guvnor."
I don't know the exact position of the troops... but in Ballantine's pocket there's a paper with all the troop movements in it.
"- You're sure of that, Sergeant?"
"- As sure as taxes, guvnor."
- I wouldn't fool you.
- I hope not.
"If you have, there'll be worse than lashes."
Please don't lash me any more.
I'll relieve you of these.
Cut him down.
"""Sgt. Thomas Ballantine hereby reenlists."""
"That's you, MacChesney, always hiding behind regulations... you Brummagem turncoat!"
"Be gallant in defeat, Sergeant."
You're simply a victim of superior strategy.
"Quiet, you Whitechapel scum, or I'll cut your slaggedy hands off at the wrist!"
- I'll pay you back with horrible interest!
- I command you to shut up!
"Tell your men to lay down their arms and get out of here, or you're a dead kipper."
Lay down your arms and leave.
- Where do those stairs lead to?
- Not to freedom.
- We'll see about that.
Ready?
- Right.
"- Sgt. Cutter, guard that door."
- Right.
"Mac, take your coat."
Right.
Get up.
It's young Toad Face blazing up the Thugs.
I'll start with him first.
"No, you won't."
John F. Kennedy?
Jon Bon Jovi?
Jon Bon Jovi.
Too easy.
"And, if I may say so, a complete load of bollocks."
"In my opinion, all men are islands."
"And what's more, now's the time to be one."
This is an island age.
"A hundred years ago, you had to depend on other people."
No one had TV or CDs or DVDs or videos or home espresso makers.
"Actually, they didn't have anything cool."
"Whereas now, you see you can make yourself a little island paradise."
"With the right supplies and the right attitude you can be sun-drenched, tropical, a magnet for young Swedish tourists."
"Hi, it's Kristina."
I haven't heard from you.
I had a great time last weekend.
"So give me a call, okay?"
'Bye.
And I like to think that perhaps I am that kind of island.
I like to think I'm pretty cool.
I like to think I'm Ibiza.
There were people who had a good time in life.
I was beginning to realize I wasn't one of them.
I just didn't fit.
I didn't fit at my old school.
I definitely didn't fit at my new one.
I heard that some kids got taught by their parents at home.
"Mum couldn't do that, unless I paid her to teach me."
Because it was just her and me.
And she went to work.
She made £400 a week.
Where was I gonna get that kind of money from?
I see I must confess.
"When I wrote you that letter, my tender feelings for you so overpowered me"
I could not find words of clarity and persuasion.
I was desperate.
I looked around me for help.
I saw George's book and stole what I needed.
But a year ago this book had not been published.
"Or even written, I suspect."
"I think I've found the truth, for which I thank you, and I owe Madame Sand an apology."
Perhaps now she and I can become friends.
Don't be content with just a little truth.
George will never be content with just your friendship.
She wants your manhood.
"Your virtue, your genius, your soul."
Listen to me!
That woman is a graveyard!
But I can help you.
I can inspire you.
This is the novel and that's the last chapter of the memoir.
- It's a bit on the thin side.
- So's my life.
- Do you know of a good tutor?
- I'll ask around.
"By the way, Mr Chopin came to see me last week."
He asked if you would call on him when you were in town.
Mmm!
Do I hear a duet?
"Perhaps this is not the last chapter, eh?"
"Give me my money, you jackal!"
Madame Aurora Dudevant.
Aurora is the name I was born with.
Aurora.
"So, uh, when can we get started?"
"When Amanda goes back, I'll have time."
Okay.
Well... good-bye.
Bye.
Ready?
"Kyle, I can't go out."
But you said we need to talk.
I'm sorry.
I can't see you.
Amanda?
Inside!
This is all your fault.
What?
My daughter flying clear across the country to surprise me.
You're not happy she's home?
I'd be happy if she hadn't used my birthday as an excuse to tell me she wants to drop out.
Drop out of the conservatory?
Why?
As if you didn't know you're the reason.
She didn't say anything to me about it.
We haven't even had a chance to talk.
You're not gonna get that chance.
"You will not see or speak to Amanda until she's back where she belongs, at that school."
I don't understand why she won't let me speak to Amanda.
"Well, unfortunately, Mrs. Bloom sees you as a distraction."
"I just want to know what happened, make sure she's okay."
"Well, put yourself in Mrs. Bloom's shoes."
"What I mean is, try to see things from her perspective."
"That music conservatory sounds like a pretty big opportunity, one that Amanda shouldn't miss."
I don't want her to miss it.
But Mrs. Bloom shouldn't force her to go back.
I won't let them do it to me.
They won't get anything.
That's how the business is done.
- What is he saying?
- He may say lots of things.
Igor...
Don't do anything to me please.
I would have given you the 500 thousand from the last contract myself if you had called me.
There was nothing between your wife and me.
"I just danced with her, and that's all."
Everything else is a lie!
Did you find any papers with my signature?
"No, we found nothing so far."
May be you should turn to the police officials?
It was a real attack.
So crazy!
I got confused.
Where are the real people?
Where are the images I created?
I'm scared.
May be I shall forget about it all and start painting again.
"I showed promise, didn't I?"
"Garik, you're my best friend."
I need your help.
The situation is difficult but not hopeless.
But if you drink so much you'll get delirium tremens instead of schizophrenia.
You're joking and I don't want to live.
I'm dreaming that I'm King Solomon.
May be you are Tsar Solomon.
May be all your troubles are just a dream.
Solomon was not a bad guy.
I wouldn't brush him aside if I were you.
You're in excruciating pain.
"God, all for a few inches."
Pain and agony for a little bit of pleasure.
I get it.
"If it's that bad, why don't you just stop sleep--"
- Doing what you're doing?
- Because it doesn't feel bad when I'm...
Doing it.
It's good.
It's great.
"And maybe if you weren't so scared of getting burned, you'd feel the same."
"You know, I used to walk tall around here."
I used to walk tall.
Then...
Came George.
He took off at least an inch.
Then Erica went and left me.
That shaved off a few more.
I got shorter.
"All that humiliation, it makes you shorter."
"So, yeah, I am scared of getting hurt because one more personal disaster right now would cut me off at the knees."
"So, uh, Valentine's day?"
"Personally, I mean, I think you can't go wrong with jewelry."
"- If you want, I can recommend some local plac--"
- What is wrong with you?
What?
We just took a liver and an intestine from a little kid.
A dead little kid.
And you don't even care.
You're talking about rainbows and relationships and crap.
What the hell is wrong with you?
You don't think that I know that they just pulled the plug on a kid?
Where?
At your company.
Isn't she a sales assistant?
So you think one of my staff members has become a porn model?
Never.
She's not my kind.
Are you going home?
Yeah.
Are you scared of your wife?
All wives are scary.
So are you going to put some mud on your golf clubs?
Oh!
You've become an expert.
Have you done this with anyone else before?
So what did you want to talk to me about?
Someone left this on my desk.
"The model is you, isn't it?"
Luckily he left it on my desk.
But what if someone left it on a managers' desk instead?
A friend of mine tricked me into this.
I don't care who tricked you.
"What I'm asking you is, what should I do?"
What should you do?
Should I show it to the manager or keep it secret?
Are you threatening me?
"No, I don't mean it like that."
I thought perhaps it would be better if I started seeing you at your home instead.
Is this a threat?
It's been quite costly.
What with the money I've been giving to you as well.
Isn't that natural because we love each other?
Why don't you show it to the manager or whoever you want?
"And I'm a monster, too."
"But you're human, Kiefer."
"In here, I can rule as the king of the Kingdom of Afternoon Naps."
"Kiefer, go outside and..."
"Now I know why I fell for you, Ryner."
"Because you were so unmotivated, I never felt like I had to be cautious around you."
I could be at ease.
"That's what I thought, but I was wrong."
It's really because you're kind.
And... because you're strong.
"Ryner, you're no monster."
I guarantee it.
"Thank you, Ryner."
I'll live on.
"And mark my words, I'll..."
I'm going.
Open up.
That surprised me.
I thought I was going to suffocate.
What's wrong?
Are you injured?
A little.
"Are you a fool, volunteering to be imprisoned?"
It was hard getting a visitation here.
You didn't have to bother.
"I'm just being kept in a prison cell instead of a school, now."
When I close my heart
When I close my heart What's this?
When I close my heart I'm leaving a horse in the northern woods tonight.
To the scent of impending darkness I'm leaving a horse in the northern woods tonight.
"To the scent of impending darkness If you do that, you'll be a suspect."
"A refrain of a far-off day of resurrection If you do that, you'll be a suspect."
Hey!
What the fuck is the matter with you?
Get out.
Get out now!
You want to sit around drinking and feeling sorry for yourself.
What is this?
You won't respect yourself until someone else does?
I respect you.
You've got a lot of courage.
The whole department is waiting to see you fall on your ass.
- You're giving them what they want.
- They want to keep me silent.
Stupid is almost as good.
"Will you go now, please?"
Just go home.
"No, I don't want to."
I don't want to go home.
What are you doing?
What made you decide to become a cop?
All the shit you've got to go through  being a woman and all.
"When I was in college, my roommate was raped."
The campus police were only interested in keeping it quiet.
I knew that the guy was white and very tall.
I started checking out basketball courts near the campus.
From the pictures I took of the white players she identified him.
- You caught the guy?
- Yeah.
This is the police.
Pull over and stop the engine.
Stop the car..!
Take the wheel.
"This is 9221 in pursuit of a murder suspect,   heading west on the railroad service road at mile 16."
Thank you.
"Thank you, Dr. Masters."
Yeah.
And now I've kept you here so late.
You must be starving.
There's still-- there's still Chinese in the fridge.
How about I make you a plate?
You probably shouldn't let yourself in here anymore.
Sorry.
"Uh, I can leave my key if you want."
"What are you doing here, Libby?"
"It was my day on the meal rotation, and I thought you might like some braised chicken."
"But maybe I shouldn't be so presumptuous, reading your mind about what you... might want."
"Well, what do you want?"
You.
You were right.
I am-
- I am so sick of pretending all the time.
This is where I want to be.
I don't tell people that-- what a mess everything was when I was growing up.
"Well, a sad childhood is not something people often discuss."
I won't even tell my boyfriends.
"Although some of mine, they actually ended up being like my father."
That's a--
A common phenomenon.
I even felt it a bit when you were angry with me just then.
Felt it?
It made me... drawn to you.
"Well, you know, it's good that you can catch yourself now when you see those patterns repeating."
And it's good I have someone I can talk to about it.
Yes.
"That's good, too."
"Say, you're right!"
"Round up the board of directors, we got to have a meeting."
"Jimmy, my boy!"
Josie.
I knew she'd bring us luck.
"All i could find, boss, was the night shift directors."
Send them in.
"Come in, folks."
"You can leave the pail outside, mrs."
Callahan.
"Sam, will you sit there?"
"Arthur, you sit at the head of the table."
"Mrs. Callahan, would you mind taking that seat?"
"All right, we have a quorum."
"We'll dispense with the reading of the minutes and the roll call, and hear the treasurer's report."
I ain't got no report to make.
But i move that the board of directors authorize this company to issue
$10 million worth of convertible bonds.
I second the motion.
I third it.
"All those in favor will signify by saying ""aye."""
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Contrary-minded?
Nay.
Motion is carried.
Look at this mop.
It's the only one i've got.
I don't think i ought to vote for that 10 million till i get a new one.
"Chairman, i move that we convert these bonds into common stock for public sale."
I second the motion.
"That isn't the case here, is it, Mr. Morris?"
Or were you even aware it was going on?
"Uh, we live on a ranch, so Georgie does chores."
"In fact, we all do chores."
She happens to love being out with the horses before school in the morning.
It's part of her routine and we couldn't stop her if we tried.
So I would hardly call it hard labour.
That's insulting.
"No one's accusing you of anything, Mr. Morris."
These are standard questions for clarification.
"Right, well, I don't think you'd have to ask these questions if you'd done any homework and found out anything about us."
How can you take these complaints at face value like this?
Honestly.
It's ridiculous.
I've done everything that's required of me.
Let's get the next one ready for the shoot.
Whoa!
Settle down there.
Whoa...
- All right.
- That's it.
- How many is this?
- Five more to go.
Whoa... there.
Thanks for keeping him calm.
"You know, this is what I miss the most."
Us working together.
"It's what we always wanted, right?"
It was a dream.
Maybe we just keep it at that.
"Oh no, he's back."
Matt is gonna see him!
"I just saw the rest of my life, and there were no more surprises."
This was it.
"I mean, it was great..."
But it was it.
What makes you think this isn't gonna happen again?
- I know it won't.
"- Oh, right."
Come on!
Aren't we supposed to be able to learn from our mistakes?
"I did something horrible, but I learned from it."
I met this little brunette and I faltered.
Are you telling me that throughout your entire marriage you never faltered?
You haven't?
Never?
- Never.
"- Oh, that makes me feel great."
You think it's because I wasn't tempted?
You think that this woman is the last brunette that's ever gonna let you know that she wants you?
Look at me.
I haven't met my last brunette.
She's the last one I'm gonna kiss.
"I'm in love with your daughter, Stephen."
"And maybe that doesn't mean anything to you, but I'm standing here."
You're her father.
"I'm looking you in the eyes and I'm telling you,"
I will do anything in the world to get your daughter back.
- Really?
Anything?
- I'll do anything.
- People say that.
They don't mean it.
- But I mean it.
"Yeah, I know."
I forgot.
She wanted to talk about the vacation.
"She wanted to know, was it, ""Like the usual?"""
This was my daughter who called or my wife?
Your daughter.
"Okay, I'll call her back."
Yes?
All that glucose...
Yes?
Worries me.
I can examine you if you want.
I'm a doctor.
"All right... what can I do for you, Dr. Kay?"
"You work at St. Louis, right?"
I don't know if I'm the right...
"Nathan, I believe you have misunderstood me."
I'm very serious.
You mustn't take hypoglycemia lightly.
"In fact, you shouldn't take any symptom lightly... ever."
You can't imagine the number of cells you burn up every day.
"Of course, you'll tell me you're also manufacturing..."
- I don't want to interrupt...
- But it's not so.
Neurons can't be replaced.
Some die every day.
Every day a few more.
All that glucose you're pumping in is just cheap energy.
"Very bad for you, very bad for the neurons."
"Thank you for your concern about my health, but I'm fine."
Now why don't you tell me what you want from me?
"That slight shaking in your hands, have you had that a long time?"
I don't want to be up all goddamn night.
- It's decaf.
- Better be.
"Nobody has a secret plan to caffeinate you, Cash."
- I do.
- Forget it.
I can't trust none of yous.
"Hey, mousse, how you doing?"
- You okay?
"- Yeah, I'm okay."
"Listen, mousse, you know, I don't go in for much emotion."
"I just wanted to say, for what it's worth, that your dad is a good man."
"You know, he served his community, saved a lot of people..."
Yeah.
"And you turned out all right, didn't you?"
"You know, I think if this is his time, he can walk toward the light with his head held up high."
"Small comfort, I know, but..."
"Thanks, Cash."
I appreciate it.
"But I got to tell you, I never really got that ""walk towards the light"" business."
Many people who have had near-death experiences have reported seeing...
I know what they say.
I'm just saying I don't get it.
"Folks find the idea comforting, John."
- I know I do.
- I don't.
"Maybe I'm a distrustful bastard, but how do we know what's beyond that light?"
"Okay, John."
Maybe that light's leading somewhere you don't want to go.
How do you know it's not hell?
"The light for hell would be red, obviously."
"Would it, Stats?"
I will die for this.
The queen will kill me herself.
What a show.
She's going out in style.
must I do everything?
"Shall I catch my head in my own hands, too?"
When can we talk about my tomb?
A florentine sculptor?
20 tons of marble?
I can't afford it.
"After the 100 musicians,"
The dozen ships made of silver and gold...
Symbolic of my journey
To heaven.
I'm not asking for a fleet.
You're not headed for heaven either.
You're dragging this out.
You have to wait for final word
On bash's legitimization anyway.
Why kill me if the line of succession reverts to my sons?
You're a treasonous adulterer.
Then I'll continue with the seating chart.
"Mary, the feast will be held there."
Choose your place of honor.
You are going to die.
What they write about your execution won't matter.
It will to my children.
50 musicians.
I'll reduce the gold inlay on my tomb.
What is that?
There's a royal visitor.
French court has gone to hell.
Put her on the God damned damn phone right now!
She's not here.
What!
?
"Look, I might as well tell you, she's with Alex now."
Alex?
"She's with him tonight, he and Claire split-up."
I'm sure you know how much she's always cared for him.
"So, like I said, I see no point in your pursuing this any further."
I'm so sorry to have keep you waiting.
"So, Mr. Jenkins, which one do you like best?"
"To be perfectly honest, I think you're more beautiful now."
Good answer.
Wai... wai... wai... wai...
"wait a minute, wait a minute."
What?
What?
What's the matter?
"What did you mean by, ""You must have loved me all along but just didn't know it.""?"
I don't...
"Yeah, but, wait, wait, wait..."
"figure it out, 'cause I'd like an answer."
"Well, I don't know, Rose, I mean, you were different then, you weren't the same as you are now."
"So, how could you have LOVED me then?"
"Well, I loved you because of who you were, not because I wanted who you are."
So now you want who I am because I'm not who I was anymore?
Okay...
"Rose, what?"
Where are you going?
"You know something, I have dreamt about this moment from the first day we met."
"I've played it out a million times in my mind... how you'd look, what you'd say, what you'd think."
- And guess what?
"So you're telling me that you want me to go flirt with Trent, rub up against his body... take my hands and stroke them down his five, six, seven, eight abs."
- No.
- I'm not finished yet!
And then I'm going to grope his perfect ass.
I'm going to make out with him.
him and steal his diamond back with my tongue.
"Look, I'll do it."
I won't like it... but I'm gonna love it!
"For real, I'm tired of pretending that we're not together."
"Listen, I know you said that we only went on one date together but we've been on a lot of dates together."
We spent the night at a bed and breakfast in Lake
"Michigan and no, I didn't tell any of our friends about it because you promised me not to but I guess they knew why anyway."
Know why that is?
Because you actually did tell them?
Yeah.
He took pictures of you sleeping.
"Completely shaved, huh?"
I liked it.
You know what?
I'm not apologizing for it.
I'm glad that us is a thing because honestly
I've been waiting for us to happen for like three years now.
And if you're embarrassed to be with me that's fine.
I could deal with that.
Uh...
wait.
Were you gonna kiss...
OK.
OK.
"Yeah, mm-hmm."
"So we're good, yeah?"
- I'm in.
"Right, yeah."
That's not an option.
"So maybe get fired and buy a puppy, then."
Really working for me.
"Which style of cuisine would your master most favour today, sir?"
He's still keen on the seafood but he's after something...soft.
"Soft, sir?"
"He's a busy man, he don't want to waste time chewing."
I understand completely.
I would suggest caviar.
"Caviar, what?"
They're fish eggs.
Soft as silk but terrifically tasty.
Fish eggs?
Mm-hm.
Fish eggs?
Mm-hm.
Fish eggs?
"Now that, my friend, is scrummy."
Hello again.
"Just to say, despite what I said earlier, we sadly had a burglary this afternoon, so now have to make a few cutbacks."
Fixing the toilets will have to wait.
Typical!
It is typical.
It's typical of one or two antisocial grain thieves who ruin it for everyone.
It's your fault for moving Big Paulus up here to play their stupid jug game.
Shut up.
It's a great game.
"Either way, we also can't afford new chairs."
"Oh, classic!"
You say you're one of us but you're just another lying exec looking after your mates.
"I, for one, won't stand for it."
"Your Honor, we call ready for trial."

"Well, isn't this interesting?"
Call down the voir dire panel.
We're gonna pick us a jury.
What I don't understand is how you don't warn me.
"Well, you haven't been listening to me."
I wasn't sure I was going to do it when we went in.
I had to see if they were ready.
We're not ready!
- We're not ready.
"- They're not, either."
"If they were ready, they would have brought a whole crew and a bunch of video equipment, a bunch more files, all kind of shit."
So you in no way feel that this is rushed.
We have no choice.
"I mean, I could get arrested any time."
"- Oh, stop."
- Or maybe killed.
Jesus Christ.
Time's not exactly on our side here.
Tomorrow?
Hmm.
"The partners aren't happy, Donald."
"I wouldn't call it exactly a revolt, but there's definite rumbling-- mostly about the Borns Tech case and your relationship with Lucy."
"That's over, and the partners' doubts will pass."
"Well-- if... we win the Borns case, maybe."
Or what?
They'll replace me?
I'd like to meet the man they have in mind.
Or the woman.
Listen.
"Please listen to me, Donald."
I don't trust you in this hospital.
"And I certainly don't trust you with my patient of three years, who's extremely important."
I...
"If you want to stay on this case, you will stay out of my way."
"You will do what I tell you, and if you have something to say to or about my patient, you will raise your hand and wait to be called on."
You--you've got to be kidding me.
Yes.
"This is a joke, right?"
Do I look like I'm laughing?
You're upset.
I don't get upset with patients.
You're mad at me for killing those women.
I get that.
Would you feel differently if you knew that I was beaten as a child?
Every day.
It's how I learned to read.
I-I used to hide under the sink and sound out the letters on the detergent box.
Is that true?
Did it make you feel better?
"Whatever helps you sleep at night, dr."
Grey.
Did you do something bad?
Traffic violation.
"What's wrong with you, kid?"
I need a new liver and a new intestine.
Yeah?
You want mine?
Are you in the north terminal?
"Well, that's where she's supposed to be."
"No, no, do-don't go anywhere."
Just wait.
Never mind.
This is where I sleep.
I didn't get a chance to make the bed today.
Where do I sleep?
"Nixon was probably in office when this was made, but there's a brand-new mattress in there."
Most of your clothes should fit here.
Put the rest in the hall closet.
"I know it's a little bit out in the open, but..."
I didn't get a chance to finish your room here.
"Yeah, I'll fix that."
It's a work in progress.
I'll have it up and running in no time.
A few minor adjustments.
"Well, I guess I'll let you get unpacked."
You don't have to come in with me.
I'm your father.
I'm supposed to.
You don't know where to go.
It's okay.
"I mean, I have done this before - gone to school."
"All right, well, this is the name they gave me."
"Mrs Gwynn, main office."
I'll be back to pick you up at 3:30.
"Okay, sure, whatever."
"My door is always open and, contrary to hall rumour, you can talk to me."
"So, do you have any questions or concerns?"
"No questions, no answers."
All right.
This is Mr Campbell's class and he's expecting you.

"Oh, no. (GIGGLES)"
It's very bad.
"No, don't!"

- What do you say to a little hunting?
- I am standing guard on my mistress.
That one?

Fascinating creature.
I'm sure she'd rather come hunting with us than sit around arranging her flounces.

- Why don't you take it to him yourself?
I've been avoiding him all morning.
"He's had a poor first impression of me, I fear."
"Before I meet him again, I want him to be convinced of my complete sincerity."
Well?
What do you think?
"Look, you know him."
How will he respond?
I can't imagine any man resisting this prose.
It would melt the Alps.
"But tell me, why do you pounce on our poor Chopin?"
- Pete?
"- Yeah, this was cold."
- This is pretty rough.
- I can see the rosiness...
- I almost didn't give you my jacket.
"- Yeah, just to be a douche."
- Just because I was so cold.
"- I thought you would have to have some major, like, Lord of the Rings CGI on my nipples because it was..."
It was like...
Nipples isn't PG-13.
They were like...
I got to the point where I couldn't feel my extremities.
"I mean, it was so cold."
"I was in a damn T-shirt, you know?"
T-shirt.
"In Lord of the Rings, are they known for their nipple CGI?"
Yes.
What do you think?
Of course.
"Oh, awkward pause."
Anyway...
"That jacket, by the way, the jacket that I put on you which is a jacket that we actually wore in like..."
"It kind of provided a bit of warmth, but not as much as you'd think."
"- No, it was like..."
- Like a thin cotton.
- It was like wearing a plastic bag.
- Yeah.
"Actually, wearing a plastic bag would've been warmer."
Look at all this.
"Okay, so let's talk about..."
- Tension.
"- The time where they had to stop the van short and I flew back and I, like, landed on my bad wrist that I had a minor surgery and stuff on in the exact spot, like on a metal drum pole."
That was pretty good.
"- I will shoot you, Sherbert."
"- All right, fine, I will put down my weapon, but you have to promise me you will not let this man go."
"- Okay, well, we're gonna cuff everyone, and then we're gonna sort this all out."
- Thank you.
"- Yeah, thanks, Sheriff."
- No!
- Now let's me and you take a little walk.
- Ooh.
"- How do you think you're getting out of this, Figgis?"
Do you even have a plan?
- I'm gonna hold you hostage to get away.
"Then I'm gonna drive to a gas station where I'll steal a clean car and head for the airport, where I'll buy a ticket with my false ID, then kill you in the parking lot and disappear again."

"I never had a problem with weight... and then all of a sudden, I weigh 10 pounds more than I did on our wedding night."
You weighed yourself on our wedding night?
I had nothing else to do.
You were in the bathroom for 45 minutes.
"Well, I wanted to look pretty for you, Bob."
I was... trying on nightgowns and primping.
"I mean, after all, Bob, it was a special occasion."
"You do remember, don't you, sweetheart?"
I've got to stop my stomach from growling.
Maybe I'll have some celery.
Sorry.
Bad joke.
It's just a laugh riot around here.
This all looks really good.
"Yeah, it's too bad you're leaving."
We never eat like this.
That's not true.
I cook all the time.
Dad...
"I'm sorry, honey."
Let's just eat.
We're not saying we want you to cook more.
"Hell, no."
You remember the meat loaf incident of '98?
That was brisket.
"Yeah, that's my point exactly."
"As your attorney, I'll cosign these forms."
They basically say that you don't have a legal parent or a guardian available.
So I'm now property of the government.
Nickname: 0382965.
"Hey, it's better than death-breath Seth."
Or so I would imagine.
"So we'll meet with your social worker in the morning, and she'll be the one to, uh... to take you to the group home."
"My contact at Child Services got you a room with only two other kids, which is good, because it can get crowded."
Thanks.
I appreciate it.
"And, you know, they do find foster homes for kids your age."
"Yeah, because everybody wants a brand-new teenager."
I'm sorry if I'm the only one here that'll state the obvious...
Seth.
"But we have all this extra room, right?"
We have a pool house.
You know that?
What?
"What, babe, what's going on in that crazy head of yours?"
"I really want this to work, Stevie."
But?
You know so little about me.
What if I turned into a werewolf or something?
I'll buy you a flea collar.
I love you.
- Stevie?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
"I set out some clean clothes for you, your stuff is not dry yet."
You always keep men's clothes lying around?
Some of my regulars.
They like to keep a clean change clothes here.
"I'll probably just throw them out now though, right?"
"Hey, perfect fit."
"Yeah, well, Trevor..."
I don't have a size 26 waist here.
"Hey, how about that idea."
I can get a job selling man's wear.
Those chicks got paid vacations too.
I'll settle for that.
That's not a bad life.
Could be worse.
You know what else I want to do?
"I want to clean up this place, just get rid of all the fucking junk."
"Probably look like I'm a terrible housekeeper, which I sometimes am... but I can also be very very, you know, organised and neat."
And I wanna do more of that.
I would love to paint a place.
"Just make it nice, just be organised, and neat and paint it white."
"Any problems, he goes to Paulie."
"Trouble with a bill, he can go to Paulie."
"Trouble with the cops, deliveries, Tommy he can call Paulie."
But now the guy's gotta come up with Paulie's money every week no matter what.
"""Business is bad?"
"Fuck you, pay me."
"Oh, you had a fire?"
"Fuck you, pay me. """
"""The place got hit by lightning, huh?"
"Fuck you, pay me. """
"Also, Paulie could do anything."
Especially run up bills on the joint's credit.
And why not?
Nobody's gonna pay for it anyway.
"And as soon as the deliveries are made in the front door, you move the stuff out the back and sell it at a discount."
Take a $200 case of booze and you sell it for $100.
It doesn't matter.
It's all profit.
"And then finally, when there's nothing left when you can't borrow another buck from the bank or buy another case of booze you bust the joint out."
You light a match.
Do you need any help reaching anything?
"You look like you're decorating a Christmas tree, ya fuckin' prick."
She's from the Five Towns.
Who?
Who?
"The Jew broad, Diane."
I was tellin' you about inside.
"I been trying to bang this broad for a fuckin' month, now."
"The only thing, she won't go out with me alone, ya know?"
-No.
"-No, what?"
"No, what Henry?"
Mr. Drew's escaped!
What?
!
Mr. Drew's escaped!
"We left him in the room, come out and see the fun, and when we went back, he was gone!"
"Why, you..."
let's get him!
"No, wait!"
We'll get him when he gets his fingers in the flypaper.
"Cornele, i told you, i've fallen among thieves!"
I ain't been righteous to you on account of jim fisk.
"He led me astray, and that's given me a misery in my conscience."
I want to get him out before he gets me out.
Ahh... now we've got at the bottom of this.
"Cornele... of course, i don't like to do business on a sunday... but it looks like me and you is gonna swap horses."
What about fisk?
Has he got anything to say?
I put him in.
I can put him out.
Uncle daniel in the lion's den!
"Say, what is this?"
"I'm sorry, commodore."
"Your butler told us that nobody was allowed through the front door, so we came- when a final settlement is made, boys, you'll be in."
"You bet your giblets, we'll be in."
"What's the deal, commodore?"
I get 5 million for half of my stock.
Drew says he'll take it out of the erie treasury.
"Why, uncle daniel, don't you know that my army is defending all that money?"
"That money's mine, too!"
I'm treasurer of erie.
You were the treasurer.
"We'll settle this right now, commodore."
Lori and Josh shouldn't be punished.
They were just helping.
Exactly.
What if Foss-
"If anyone important calls, I'll have it with me."
Do I get one last call?
No.
But you do get to go to your rooms.
Now.
Grounding Kyle.
Who would have expected it?
And he was the ringleader.
When did that start happening?
Be honest.
"You're kinda glad they did it, aren't you?"
Well?
Aren't you?
Some rules are meant to be broken.
About that.
"I think we should break some rules, too."
"Stephen, I don't want us to sail into a complacent, suburban existence without fighting the good fight."
I want you to pursue that opport U.W.
"Nicole, that's not an option."
"Well, then we need to make it one."
You can't get the chance to pursue an old dream and just pass on it.
We have mouths to feed.
We'll keep them fed.
We'll make it work.
We always do.
Spring cleaning isn't just about sorting through things and getting rid of clutter.
It's about taking stock of who you are and how others see you.
"It's a chance to redefine yourself, to change expectations."
Maybe it's where he was planning on taking his victims.
That's what I was afraid of.
Check this out.
That's a body.
What is it?
This is the fallout to his confession.
"What do you think, he was making Putnam watch it?"
STEVE:
That's exactly what I think.
And then he left him locked up in here with only one way out.
"Thought we had lost you there, cuz."
(groans) Get off me.
What happened?
You don't remember?
We were just floating out there on that life raft.
And I spotted land.
That's right.
"You were so excited, you jumped up and lost your balance."
"By the time we got you back in the raft, you had swallowed so much water, that you passed out."
Doc had to do mouth to mouth to get you breathing again.
MAX:
Ah.
"Glad to see you back on your feet, Captain."
Where the hell are we?
"Now, that is a good question."
My best bet is we're on one of the uninhabited islands of the Hawaiian chain.
Most likely Lehua.
Lehua?
"Now, all we have to do is survive until we get discovered."
"Fortunately, I had a have a head start on building the fire."
I did it while you were unconscious.
At least we'll be warm while we starve to death.
"Ah, I don't get much call for the good stuff anymore."
"Most of my business is just teenagers, you know... trying to get past a bouncer at a titty bar."
Titty bar.
Got no appreciation for art.
You know?
Give me your right hand.
How about folding your sleeve back?
"This stuff gets on your shirt, it'll never come out."
"And slide these on for me, if you don't mind."
"This, uh-This is you, isn't it?"
"Uh, kind of hard to tell from here."
"Put those on for me, if you don't mind."
"In some situations, a tactical retreat is your best option."
"Listen, bud."
"I'm sorry as I can be about this, but, uh... a guy like me don't stay in business very long... unless he slips the F.B.I. a bone every now and then, and let's face it..."
- you're a big old soupbone.
- I'm flattered.
Yeah.
They come through here every now and then asking about you.
A guy with a gun is a guy with a gun.
You can fight him and risk someone getting shot or wait for backup.
"You gonna be my ""get no hassles for a year""card."
Yeah.
Special Agent Allerot.
Yeah.
Tell him it's Jumbo.
"Well, how manyJumbos you think he knows?"
"Hi, honey!"
Look at the deal I got on these shoes.You're not gonna believe it.
Lady.
"Lady, you can't be back here."
- Get out of here.
She's got the flu.
- Mm.
"- Yeah, she's got the flu and she didn't want to come, but I begged her."
Uh-huh.
"And she took this cold medicine, and it's knocking her out, but it--it's sweet, actually."
Now can we--or do I gotta keep pretending to enjoy this giant nut-covered ball of cream cheese
Olivia calls an appetizer?
You want me to represent you?
This is what's gonna happen.
You're gonna make an excuse up as to why you can't be at dinner tonight.
"You're gonna dump the broad, clean up your act, and never, ever come back to my house fucked up again."
You kicking your habit on your own?
That's a slim chance of happening.
"You two doing it together, zero."
That's my offer.
Okay.
[sets drink down]
"Yeah, I just thought of a perfect excuse."
Okay.
"Um, Olivia, we can't make dinner tonight because your husband's a cunt."
"Oh, Nick."
How's that?
You don't know her.
- You don't fucking know me.
- Mm-hmm.
I could throw a rock out your front door and hit nine of you.
You're not special.
You are a by-product of those of us who are!
[comic talking indistinctly onstage]
[Bill and Sully laughing and chatting]
"Yeah, I know you will, you always do."
Oh!
The fact he's still alive argues against aortic injury.
"- Page me with the result, okay?"
"- Elizabeth, I think there's more to discuss."
"Kerry, I'm a trauma surgeon."
"The last time I checked, you weren't chief of staff."
Keep me apprised of his condition.
"- Okay, the last one."
- Can I go see him now?
No.
We have to make sure you didn't bruise your heart or damage your lungs.
- They' re not doing anything.
- Probably just waiting to go up to surgery.
I'm sure he's stable.
I told Mr. Chambers we were 10 minutes late.
It's a trick I use to get him to meetings on time.
- You don't call him by his first name?
- He's kind of formal.
How long have you been working for him?
Two years.
"Six days a week, 10 hours a day."
Probably spend more time with him than his wife does.
They' re really happy though.
"I mean, she's lucky to have him."
- He's a good man.
- Luka no fragments in the x-ray.
Ready to irrigate?
Yeah.
Put Polysporin on the wound.
Where'd you get that one?
A lowlife stuck me in the back with a switchblade.
An inch to the left and you would have lost a kidney.
Guy that did it to me got snuffed with a sawed-off.
Gnomes.
I don't like gnomes.
Also I don't like fireeaters.
And I don't like dried fruit of any kind.
And I don't like those big mental dogs that come running at you in parks.
"I mean, you wouldn't let a lion or crocodile run loose in Regent's Park, would you?"
- Say some things you don't like.
"- Shut up, Calum."
I'm bored.
"Look, surveillance is boring."
"There's a pair of jays in that tree, if you look."
Big thrill
You know who really loves the countryside?
Nonces.
It makes it easier to grab the kids.
You always hear about weird shit like that happening in places like this.
That's more like it.
That's the undercover's wife.
Caroline Risdale.
Ticking my boxes.
I'd go under the covers with her.
But there's only one thing that comes before a lady.
My dinner.
I'm starving.
I'd eat those two jays in a sesame seed bun.
?
"I'll get us something to eat, then we'll start working in shifts."
Why?
"Because if we don't, I'm gonna start garroting you myself."
"Don't be like that, John."
"Come on, mate."
What kind of bag?
"We need a distraction, so you can set the prisoners free."
"The mutineers are all on edge, because they think there are demons on this island."
My good friends here will help supply them.
What about your spirits and laying bones to rest?
"They are happy, crusoe."
I have discussed it with them.
Even spirits need a change of scenery now and again.
But I promised to return them once it is done.
Those mutineers are tough.
They'll not buy this.
The tough ones always fear the most.
Think back when you first came here.
"Alone on the island, when the sun went down."
"No hope, no help."
And no name for the things you feared the most.
Come out!
You are without a doubt the most surprising human being I have ever known.
We can take care of things from here.
"I think we will be quite all right, thank you."
Our orders are to watch you at all times.
"But not while we wash, surely."
Nolan!
Look.
What?
Back to camp.
Now!
Move!
And that is just the beginning.
Come on.
We've got work to do.
Do you understand these people?
Neither do I.
He unfortunately reminded me that knowledge is power.
Pack him off to Magaluf.
He can sell dodgy pills from his bar with the rest of the bent coppers.
Maybe.
It's a funny thing to sell your soul for... ..a new beamer.
Yeah.
Cars have never really done it for me.
"Well, what has?"
"Apart from your work, of course."
My work's enough.
And now you have a new toy.
"One you gave the full VIP treatment to, I'm told."
You gave me the impression he was very important.
We could have hauled him in at the hotel.
I know that.
Do you mind if I ask why?
Poor man had been in prison for five years.
That's very charitable of you.
And aren't you always telling me that the stick is a weapon for the short term?
I'm glad somebody listens to me.
We'd best hope he doesn't fall for you.
He's more likely to try and kill me.
And why should you care?
Glittering in a place where a heart should be.
Go and make a drink.
Why are we watching this geezer?
Because Lenny hasn't decided what to do with him yet.
Neighbours used to have loads of them in the garden.
With fishing rods.
Little ones.
Sitting on mushrooms.
Mum said it lowered the tone.
"And then they come in all dramatic for that final ""yes."""
"So, it goes a little something like, ""Yes, yes, yes, yes."""
"And then they get all dramatic for that final ""yes."""
"Say, ""Yes!"
"Oh."""
I don't think that's how they do it.
I'd have to hears it again.
"""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!"""
Yeah.
"Yeah, porno girls do that."
"But only when the porno guys aren't busy finding some super-low tone and repeating over and over again,"
"""Ah, fuck."""
"""Ah, fuck."""
"I takes a bit offense to that, Miss Katy, as I have a naturally low voice, and I do likes to say, ""Ah, fuck."""
"""Ah, fuck."""
Exceptin' I don't do it in pornos.
"Well, then you should do voiceovers for English-dubbed foreign pornos, Dan, because that was a text book ""ah, fuck, ah, fuck."""
"Why thank you, Miss Katy."
"I've never had any complaints from any of my sexual companions about my ""ah, fuck, ah, fuck."""
KATY:
"Let me hear yours, Dary."
"Well, I..."
"I'm confused still on the ""yes, yes, yes, yes, yes's."""
"So, Wayne, it's like, uh,"
"""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes""?"
"See, it's not as if it's a fuckin' question, Dary, is it?"
You're saying it like it's a question.
"So, it's like, ""Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."""
"You're gettin' closer, Dary, but what you want to do is put a little pepper on the end of it."
You just want to put a little pepper on the end of it.
"Like, ""Yes!"""
"""Yes!"""
"Well, jim knows a lot more about business than i do."
"But you'll pardon me for saying it, but... i know more about women, and, uh- and you think he's made a bad investment."
His luck.
I'll take stocks and bonds.
"Hey, daniel!"
"Whoa, baby!"
Whoa.
"I might have known it was you, cornele vanderbilt."
A- whoopin' and a- rushing' around like a fiend in a fiery chariot.
You done near scraped the paint off my buggy.
"I'm sorry, daniel, but i wanted to make you an offer."
I thought maybe you might like to swap old bessie there for my team of thoroughbreds.
You want to swap that team for my bessie?
"Yes, daniel."
I'll swap you even- if you throw in the erie railroad.
It ain't no secret i'm gonna get control of erie.
I'm doing it because someone's got to protect the public from weasels like you.
Ya!
Now you boys listen to me.
That erie of mine is the best-paying railroad in america.
"For you, uncle daniel, or the stockholders?"
"For him, that's why he owns it."
Yes.
"When i get a good thing, vanderbilt don't sleep easy unless he gets some of the gravy."
Neither do we.
Who is he?
Do we have to put up with him?
He's the brains of our organization.
He don't look very bright to me.
What were you saying about the erie?
"When i say up, erie goes up."
"When i say down, erie goes down."
"Well, let's go eat and then you can tell me all about the mysterious John Mercer."
How's the cat?
"What cat would that be, Calum?"
The one out of them science books you was always reading in prison.
Is the cat dead?
Is it not dead?
Is it both dead and not dead?
You remember that?
It's clever shit.
"But that was always your reputation, right?"
"Don't mess with the clever, quiet one."
"Why are you so negative about it all, John?"
I enjoyed sharing a cell with you.
I learned a lot.
Why have you got your eyes closed?
Because when I open them again I'll be waking up in my nice cosy cell.
And you won't be with me.
I'm still here.
"What do you do for them, Calum?"
"You know, pretty much what I've always done."
"Multitasking, bits and bobs, needles and pins."
"Not quite how the judge described it at your sentencing, was it?"
What do they want us to do?
Do the stuff the law can't do.
Dealing with people the law can't reach.
"Come on, John, you're the clever one."
Have you not worked it out yet?
Check out the CVs.
Who can make sure the cat is most definitely dead?
You're the specialist.
You're the killer.
"Morning, flatmate."
Um... those are bluebells.
They're for my sister's bouquet.
They're cute.
"We went the ""beauty and meaning"" route, so every flower is symbolic."
"Like,bluebells are for humility."
Peonies.
They're for sharing a happy life.
"And,uh... these little guys?"
Those are... those are lilies of the valley.
They're for sweetness.
# I can feel the pressure building #
# And I want you like I don't know #
"# Oh,boy #"
# I'm a sucker for your sound #
# And I love it when you're around #
# I'm a sucker for your sound #
# You know I'm playing with you now. #
"I missed you so much,my angel."
My heart... is so... full right now.
"So was he crying with... with sound, or just physical tears?"
A little sound.
Did he at least throw himself into traffic after?
No.
"After,we talked about the intense feelings he has for me and why he has them."
"Which should be fun,right?"
I don't know why I spend so much time on my abs when nothing turns women on more than indifference.
"- Not what it's about,Cy."
- All I know is rocker guy was a changed man when he was blowing you off.
And then he cried.
"Just saying,she's a girl who needs the chase."
"- No,I'm not."
"- Yeah,you are."
Are you sure?
"Thank you, but I wait in the car."
What's the matter with you?
I'm sad for my father.
"All right, but you gotta get over it."
So I unwrap the paper... and there she is... with her head held high and her ears perked up.
And there I am smiling.
What happened then?
"Still, I gotta be the sad clown."
"A front for my friends, my family."
"You know, a brave front."
I've heard you describe yourself this way.
The sad clown.
I've never seen it.
Carmela also painted a very different picture.
What do you mean?
"Volatile, punching the walls."
Compulsive gorging on food.
Kind of a far cry from the seltzer bottle and bicycle horn.
I'm sorry.
"Maybe you'd like Carmela to be here, if I'm so fucking obnoxious."
"What I'm trying to establish is your response to sadness... is usually rage, not humor."
You two don't have to trouble yourselves.
Because I doubled my dosage.
I don't want you taking 80 milligrams of Prozac.
"You kick it up to 80 for a week, 10 days... just to pull back on the stick, get the nose up... then you duck back down to 40 before the limp dick thing sets in."
One:
that's ineffective.
Two:
it's not a treatment for grief.
Let's get back to Pie-O-My.
It's sad that you've lost something that you love.
"It has, like, Compressed some minerals."
"Gold likes to travel,"
But gold gets stuck with Other heavies pretty easily.
So we're thinking All we have to do.
Is jack up one of these Boulders.
And that might give us a clue On where the gold deposits are.
"So we got to boulder here,"
But I got to get some straps Around the boulder.
Zeke will try To float the massive stone.
Using straps and an air bag.
I don't do a lot of Boulder floating so
I don't know How this is gonna go down.
"All right, Just don't be under the boulder."
When you lift it.
But hoisting A 200-pound rock 35 feet down.
In the bering sea Is easier said than done.
Is that Enough slack?
Yes.
I think I'm gonna try to lift On it and see what happens.
Whoa.
Off the coast Of remote sledge island...
I think I'm gonna try to Lift on it and see what Happens.
Zeke tenhoff Is trying to pull.
A 200-pound boulder from The depths of the bering sea.
Whoop.
Whoa.
I see it.
There it is.
Are you okay?
"Well, I just Lost a float bag."
Looks like you didn't Strap it on good enough.
"Um, well, I'm just gonna Look under this boulder."
I'm perfectly willing to let it go.
But I don't drink anymore... and I don't lie.
"And as far as I know, I'm not crazy."
So if you're accusing me...
"Look, here's the thing."
I don't know how I ended up here last night.
I didn't even know I was in West Virginia.
"Some how, between 1:00 and 2:30..."
I traveled 400 miles and ended up on that road by your house... and I've got no memory of it.
And you call me crazy?
I was afraid I'd see you here.
Okay.
You didn't show up.
Too bad.
I really wanted to know what I look like.
"Sergeant, I'm curious."
Last night you said... things had been strange... around here lately.
- What kind of things?
- You really don't want to know.
Now I really need to know.
Just your odd reports.
"People seeing things they can't explain, so they all come to me."
'Cause you're the cop.
Because they know me.
"You know, if there are other people in this town... who are feeling as... confused as I am right now..."
I'd sure like to hear it.
"The past few months, people have been coming up to me... and reporting that they've been seeing strange things."
I don't mean the town speed freak.
"I mean good, honest, church going people."
I've known these folks my entire life... and they seem down right embarrassed to be bringing it up.
Bringing what up?
It's hard to explain.
"When Lotus arrives,"
I'll ask Yan to let her sit on this chair.
Then Yan will get the tea by leaps and bounds.
Isn't it great?
That's great!
Am I smart?
"Master, how to kiss her?"
Take a seat.
"When she is all wet, what's next?"
She will be very ugly and she will scream!
"No, no!"
She will get changed!
"Master, how can she get changed in public?"
Look!
This door will lock up automatically when it's closed.
"At the same time, water will flush out from this hole."
"According to human beings' instinct, Lotus will..."
Stuff it with her finger.
"At the same time, another water-column comes from that side."
She will stuff with another finger.
But she can't imagine that... another water-column aims... at her face!
"Master, do you mean it?"
Lotus is so poor then.
She can't seek for any help!
She must be scared and doesn't know what to do.
"In order to stop the water, everyone knows she will... stuff the hole with her tongue."
"That's right, you stand in front of the changing room."
"When it's the right time, remove the hose, move forward and kiss."
So I can kiss her.
Smug calcultation!
"When you hear the bell ringing, go ahead and kiss her."
What's the use of kissing her?
It's a bad idea.
It's just gonna alienate her more.
Georgie...
I'm getting complaints!
People are furious!
You're turning down everyone's offer?
Why?
They're too low!
"I told you, they go to the highest bidder."
My client offered you twelve hundred dollars.
That's way higher than any meat buyer's gonna give you!
What is wrong with you?
!
Will said your father loved those horses!
How can you just kill them?
Those horses killed my father.
I understand you're under fire from the CPS.
It must be very difficult.
You should know since you're the one who instigated the entire thing!
I don't see how you can show your face at our door.
You took the truth and you twisted it into total lies.
I believe I had just cause.
You tried to keep me from seeing my only niece.
"I told you, you wouldn't get away with it."
But...
I can make this all go away.
For a price.
For a price?
"I'm sorry, you're blackmailing us!"
It's hardly blackmail.
"If you want me out of Georgie's life that much, then I believe I deserve a little compensation."
You have my number.
"I've got nobody to spend them on, except you."
Now you won't let me have any fun at all.
"Oh, but i'd love to have that necklace."
I've always been hungry for pretty things.
All right.
We'll form a corporation.
Josie mansfield and company.
"Still talking big, mr."
Fisk.
"Oh, show business ain't any different from any other business- you can't stay in it unless you make money out of it."
I'll build you up like i would a big corporation.
"Your assets are looks, talent, and ambition."
You'll be a fine investment.
Even corporations can fail.
Not mine.
Not jim fisk's.
I've got the golden touch.
I got it here.
No.
I think you've got it there.
"Oh, jim, may i see you a moment?"
What's on your mind?
"Well, uh... oh, don't mind josie."
She's one of the firm.
There isn't anything you can't say in front of her.
I'm afraid i'll have to see you alone.
Will you excuse me?
"Old man drew's outside, and he's hopping mad."
"The madder you get a goose, the easier it is to pull his tailfeathers."
But what good's a handful of tailfeathers if you lose a golden egg?
"Keep him here in our henhouse, i'll be with you in a minute."
"You know, josie, i've got a feeling in my bones that you're going to bring us luck."
I want to be married to you.
Gregory... you are married to me.
"Right... that's right, that's right, yeah, right."
What?
- I'm getting a little dizzy.
"- Oh, that's all right, it'll pass, just hold on to me."
"Rose, don't ever leave me again."
I'm not leaving you...
I love you.
"I couldn't stand being away from you, it was killing me."
"Ah, I'm so glad."
"I don't care if you ARE pretty, I love you anyway."
"Listen, everything's gonna drop as I get older, and I'm gaining weight as we SPEAK."
"Well, that's comforting."
"- Get in, Lady."
"- Oh, no, not you again!"
- You know this guy?
- He's a good man.
"I can't believe this, your windows are still broke?"
"Complain to the cab company, I got nothing to do with it."
You can see that F of X equals E to Y...
"Times E to the X, which is what we were trying to prove."
Notice the elegance of the proof.
It's beautiful!
"It actually reminds me of a quote by Socrates,"
"""If measure and symmetry are absent from any composition in any degree,"
"""the ruin awaits both the ingredients and the composition."
"""Measure and symmetry are beauty, and virtue the world over."""
He's cute.
Do you think he's straight?
"Oh, yeah, he's too boring to be gay."
"He was in his car like, ""That negro's crazy."
"Something is wrong."""
"Telling you, man."
"Fucking gangster women, man, I like you."
"You freak--oh, my God."
So much power in a woman.
You know where you can find it exactly though?
Legs.
I'm a leg man.
Any other leg men in here?
So what the rest of y'all?
Titty fuckers?
"I'm a leg--there's nothing sexier than a woman with a nice pair of legs, you know what I'm saying?"
Just walking out just nice and just...
Put some thigh-high stockings on.
"Oh, my God!"
That shit is sexy.
"Women, if you don't got a pair of thigh-high stockings, go get some, make your man hot like instant grits."
I'm so serious.
"Matter of fact, if you don't got some right now,"
"I want you to go home, order it from Victoria Secret, and send me the picture."
"Make sure it ain't Snapchat, 'cause I'll get pissed off."
That's all I'm saying.
"But stockings, boy, it's so sexy."
"But women, let me talk to you, okay?"
If you got a fat leg... please do not take a fishnet stocking and put it on the fat leg.
"Now you got little fat pieces popping out the fishnet, and it look like Bubble Wrap."
"Now, me being the type of person I am,"
I'm trying to pop this shit.
"""What the hell?"""
Jump on it.
That shit--
- Why?
- Because I say so.
"- Anything you say, my dear."
I don't understand why you want to go on leading this unhappy life.
I was perfectly happy until you came.
You're pretending again.
I know very well you're fond of me.
You're just fighting to cover it up.
It must be wonderful to be gifted with so much insight.
"Well, it's very nice, but will you promise to send back those plans?"
They'll be in government hands by tomorrow morning.
There.
I knew you were a woman of intelligence the moment I set eyes on you.
Sort of a like recognizing like.
Thank you.
"Now, please excuse me."
I really have some things to attend to.
- Can't I stay here and help—
"- No, no."
Thank you.
Really.
- Will you have dinner with me tonight?
"- Yes, of course I will."
"But, now, please, excuse me and—"
- Thank you.
- You really are a bit of a darling.
- That's nice of you to say so.
- I'm not bad myself.
"As a matter of fact, I'm considered pretty crisp, in a manly sort of way."
- You'll probably find that out when we get better acquainted.
- No doubt.
Good-bye.

I'm sorry.
It's just that they're gonna execute me in five days.
Five days.

"Not just a boyfriend and not just guy friends, but girlfriends."
I don't like girls.
"They're catty and mean and, well, I like guys."
"Okay, well, you probably don't like girls because you've had bad experiences with girls."
"No, I've had a bad experience with a guy and I still like guys."
I just don't like girls on a general principle.
"Look, I don't know what I would have done without my friends when I was pregnant."
"You need to meet some girls, some girls your age."
"Uh, it's kind of hard to make friends with girls my age when I'm pregnant."
"Well, you made a friend and you're pregnant."
My point exactly.
"Ethan wants to be my friend, even maybe my boyfriend."
You think there are any girls here who want to be my friend?
No.
And I don't care.
You suck.
You suck.
"Kathy, that is not how you make friends."
She was staring at me.
We were staring at her.

Well she didn't.
Because you told her that she sucks.

I've been thinking about what's best
For all of us as well.
I'm leaving.
You needn't worry.
And yet I do.
So you won't be leaving us just yet.
I have some news to share.
Turns out the english queen isn't dead after all.
The english queen is alive?
But I would keep the news to yourself.
You did this.
To see me married.
The messenger's news was flawed.
No one could blame that on me.
Or you.
Everyone needs a little push on occasion.
Even queens.
Even France.
All happiness comes with a price.
And you paid yours with another's broken heart.
Sebastian...
Will survive.
It's time for the consummation.
"Dad, have you ever asked me what I really wanted to do?"
How dare you talk to my dad like that?
Get up and go to your room.
You are acting as if these people want the worst for you.
Did you see that?
I have just said one word and he has spoiled my dinner.
I'm ashamed of you.
You're vile!
I didn't do anything to make anyone feel ashamed.

"Yes, it is."
"Then, if all living things that are lions are animals... animals that are living are lions."

All lions are animals.
All tigers are lions.
The bottom line is that all living...

How much time do we have till the break?
Damn it!
Kaan.
Come here.
He's going to give the questions again.
You take this and go to the stationery across the street.
How many copies do you need?
Make 40 copies of it.
Tell them to charge it to Professor Rahmi.
I bet that he won't even open it to check the questions.
What do you mean?
The teacher gives him questions and he never looks at them?
"Of all those smiling kids, how many are still smiling?"
"I mean, back then we just assumed that everything would work out."
"How many of us are going to end up in a good place, without messing it up along the way?"
"And I just felt really good, 'cause, like..."
I was one of the happy ones.
I had found Joanne.
And what do you do when you lose the person you were meant to be with?
"Just so I know, um..."
How long are you gonna wallow?
She left me an hour ago.
I was thinking maybe an hour and ten minutes?
"Dude, you have got to stop thinking about her as the person you were meant to be with."
"In fact, just stop thinking about her as a person."
"For a while, she is just that selfish, hurtful whore."
"Well, I'll give you selfish and hurtful."
"Oh, give me whore, too!"
Come on.
She just dumped you in front of 20 strangers at a party that you threw for her.
I think we can trade up.
I guess.
I just can't even imagine being with anyone else.
I know.
I do.
"It hurts, but..."
I have totally forgotten your name.
"I'm sorry I have to go, but I need to pick up my sister."
It's all right.
"We can, uh, do this again."
Really?
"Yeah, sure."
And not just for coffee.
"Next time, there may be pie."
It was nice.
"You know, my contract's up pretty soon."
I was thinking of re-upping.
Nothing else you'd rather do?
No.
I was recruited by a software company in college.
The kind that makes apps for phones.
What's wrong?
Pay is no good?
"No, it was great, actually."
"Obscene, to be honest with you."
"Why didn't you do it, then?"
I don't know.
"I don't know, I guess I just felt like it was silly, it wasn't really that important, you know?"
I guess I like the idea of serving my country.
Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
What about you?
You never wanted to do anything else?
"There comes a time when you do a thing long enough, you can't really imagine doing anything else, you know?"
"So, if I stay here, I'm stuck with you forever?"
Yes.
Be careful what you wish for.
"You're doing it again, aren't you?"
What?
You have that look that you get.
What look?
You're squinting one eye as if you're taking aim with a gun.
- You're gonna be late.
- It's horrifying.
I'm sure you're great fun at parties.
"Seriously, you don't have to think about killing everyone that you ever meet."
- I don't.
I'm here to see Alvers.
Marcus.
Michael.
How was your trip?
Interesting.
"I still don't understand why you risked so much down in Mexico, why you didn't come here directly."
240 million dollars made it worth the risk.
What about Nina?
"If she wasn't killed by the bomb,"
I'm sure our buyers took care of her once they found out she didn't deliver the virus.
"Either way, she's out of the picture."
I hope so.
She can point to both of us.
We'll be long gone before anyone starts looking.
Kim.
"Look, I know we haven't talked since I got back."
"No, we haven't."
"I know what you must be thinking, but you need to give me a chance to explain."
I don't know what to think.
"Look, I'm happy that you're okay, but this thing... you have a baby, Chase."
"We've been together for more than three months, and you kept this secret from me."
Who's the mother?
Where does she fit into this?
That's what I want to talk to you about.
I didn't know I had a daughter until a month ago.
How could you not know?
Angela's mother and I went out last year.
"Okay, it's over."
"And when it ended, she never told me she was pregnant."
"Now she calls a month ago and tells me she has a baby, and that I'm the father."
"And she's in trouble, and she can't handle it."
I was afraid to let people find out.
"You go backwards, you fall on your back."
- Give me that gun.
"- I get these bullet things out, I'll be comfortable."
Now you can point it at me all day if you like.
- Just why did you come here?
"- Well, I-I— Marjorie—"
"You don't mind me calling ""Marjorie,"" do you?"
Of course you don't.
"Marjorie, why don't you give up this life of yours?"
You're far too young and beautiful to spend it in jail.
- What do you take to get these delusions?
- You're wrong.
- I'm doing this for your own good.
Now let's sit down.
- Leave my coat alone.
- I'll hang it up for you.
"- Please, give it to me."
Give it to me.
- I won't drop it.
"- Now, please go."
Dash it!
I can't go until I do the thing I came here to do.
Why don't you give up this life you're leading.
It's not going to get you anywhere.
Oh?
That's most flattering.
But just what do you think I am?
"You can stop all this bluff because I happen to know you've borrowed some plans... that belong to the government, and I think it only sporting to tell you... that a large number of detectives are following you around."
- Now I know there's something wrong with you.
- Don't go on pretending.
Two Scotland Yard men followed you to my house yesterday.
- Really?
I quit because I couldn't take it anymore.
I couldn't work those hours anymore.
"But I felt he was always an honorable... thoroughly honorable guy, except for the way he treated the women in his life."
"And that was not honorable, but..."
Do you remember thinking about that?
"I mean, how the women took it?"
"I did, because I was married, had a wife, two children."
"And I knew what that was like, and I knew... that's when I... that's when I finally quit."
"For the last time, I came home and... my Estelle was crying, and she said, ""We never see you."""
"And I said, ""Oh, that's it."
I can't...
"Can't do it anymore."""
"But he just could juggle people's lives, and it didn't bother him."
I don't understand it.
I don't know how he could do it.
I don't know how he had the mental strength for it.
It would have...
I would have had a breakdown.
But he didn't.
He was such a tough guy.
"He really was tough as hell, you know, I mean..."
- Mentally.
- In what way?
"Well, how could he juggle three or four lives like that?"
Lou was very secretive.
He liked to keep his business to himself.
"And he'd call and say,"
"""You know where I am, but nobody else is to know where I am."""
"And I'd say, ""Okay,"""
because they would call looking for him.
- Who would call?
"- Esther would call Saturdays and Sundays, or Anne Tyng would call."
I'm going to tell you something.
Tendo wasn't a dumb fuck like you.
The first thing he is expecting is a strike right now.
So we count his hit as a pay back.
"Let's get back to business, huh?"
No!
Don't you ever fucking talk to me like that again.
We let things cool down.
We let things cool down.
We find out when tendo goes back to Japan.
We find out who the fuck the American is he has working for him.
"Ok, once we got this information, then what?"
Then we call in our connections.
And we blow them off the face of the fucking earth.
This is Tony's.
Sam?
Sam?
"Man, what took you so long?"
I'm freezing my nuts off here.
"I didn't pick this place, tell it to the captain."
"No, you tell it to the captain."
Man he is mad as hell at you!
For what?
You get sent undercover and the next thing he knows San Pedro looks like v-8 juice.
What the hell happened this time?
Tendo is in town.
Campanela found out and tried to knock him off.
"Yeah, well I heard they would have succeeded if some asshole hadn't interfered."
"Yeah, well I heard they would have succeeded if some asshole hadn't interfered."
"Are you talking about me, Sam?"
"Shit yeah, I'm talking about you."
You're supposed to be helping us bring these guys down.
- Same here.
- So... who was the most orgasmic woman you've ever been with?
"No, I wasn't talking about me, actually."
Jonathan here mentioned a woman that he was dating that was very lively?
- Lively.
- Really?
You've got an awfully good grip.
"It's probably kind of handy in bed, isn't it?"
How orgasmic was she?
Thank you about the grip.
"Yeah, I... she was..."
- I don't want to be rude.
- I don't mind talking about sex.
It's what everybody's thinking about anyway.
Why don't we sit down and have a drink and be civilized?
"I'd love to, but we actually were on our way out right now."
So maybe some other time.
"So anyway, hello and goodbye."
Nice to meet you.
That was really weird... the way Antrem wouldn't let go of my hand.
He's a strange and tormented creature.
It really disturbs me that Priscilla loved me once and now loves him.
I'd hate to think what that means.
They're very nice ladies.
"Well, one of them is."
I'd be doing them a huge favor.
I don't feel good about this.
I don't want you to be a sperm donor.
But it's flattering.
They're fans of my work.
I've never had lesbian fans before.
They should go to a sperm bank.
I get to have no-strings-attached sex with someone who's not my husband.
That is the fantasy.
What's the ideal client for you?
Rich women.
They tip well.
Half the men I meet mistake me for a bank.
And the other half are either just plain boring or collecting social security.
"So, it's about companionship for you?"
"No, dear."
It's about the sex.
I take my job seriously.
"I brighten a lot of lives, and that takes care, focus."
I want every woman I'm with to feel... seen.
Feel special.
His name is Jeremy.
He was the only normal guy.
Marriage is a sacred union.
And your sex life is an expression of that bond.
"But when lovemaking gets routine, how can you spice things up?"
It's research.
"An open marriage can be a safe, fun way to bring excitement back into the bedroom."
And we can help.
I hired them for the party.
They work as a husband and wife team?
Yeah.
"That's crazy, right?"
I don't know.
"A lot of it does make sense, doesn't it?"
"I mean, when you meet them, they seem like a really happy couple."
Is this what we should be?
Polyamorous?
An open marriage?
Going back to that house is what Violet wanted.
You try telling her what to do.
"I'd like to, but I haven't had the chance."
You're handling it.
I need your help.
I'll stop by this afternoon.
Thank you.

Continue the mannitol and hyperventilate him to a P.C.0.2 of 35.
Hey.
What happened?
Cerebral contusion.
He wouldn't stop seizing.
I had to induce a barbiturate coma.
"Neuro put a pressure monitor in, but I can't get the pressure to come down."
So he may die?
Yeah.
Little bit of justice.
I'm just saying.
"Sam, if he dies..."
Michelle could be charged with murder.
"And what, Tammy has a father who's dead and a mother in jail?"
"All right, well, now you're just making me feel bad, so stop it."
"Michelle, if you don't tell the truth now, you'll go to jail."
I am.
I just don't buy it.
You're still trying to protect some image that you have of your family or of Darren.
"It wasn't an accident, and if he dies, you will be charged with manslaughter or worse."
"You have to stop protecting him, if not for yourself, then for your daughter."
Think about Tammy.
I am.

Told who what?
Don't bullshit me.
You told Alex

What I did was I told you to drop it.
And I did.
"I didn't spend one more second working on it, just like you ordered me to."
Then what the hell is your problem?
My problem is he just showed up to the courtroom and blew up the case.
"He embarrassed us, he embarrassed me, and he did it in front of everyone."
The courtroom?
I thought you said you weren't involved.
I was sitting in the back watching.
"There's no law against that, and that is not the point."
"No, the point is you went from A to Z and assumed that I told him."
How the hell else would he know?
It's none of your damn business how I knew.
"No, no, this is between me and Harvey."
"Wrong, this is between me and you because you broke your agreement with my client."

"You know, if I was uptight, I'd be offended by that."
"In fact, I am offended."
You shouldn't call people bitches.
You shouldn't do that anymore.
"Unless it's like ""bitch"" or something like that."

How the hell did Moyes end up on two lists?
I made it clear Ben should run all his list alterations past me.

And now they're expecting money.

- Money?
Money?
"Gary, I said access only."
"Yeah, now we're gonna have to divert funds from the campaign and that's fraud."
And then we're gonna have to destroy the evidence and that's conspiracy to commit fraud.
I believe you meant that.
"Oh, I did, sir."
"I'd say we make rather a good team, don't you?"
Yeah.
"Sort of like Sherlock Holmes and Watson, sir."
"No, no, no, no, no."
More like Sherlock Holmes and Sherlock Holmes.
"Well, what I mean, sir, is the way I see it,"

Not when you have to pay out as much as I do.
"Well, I gotta get to work on Sid Daley."
"Boy, it's hard to find someone in Rome, sir."
"Yes, I imagine."
But his story has to be checked out just like anybody else's.
"Oh, by the way, sir, did I mention that we found the gun in the prop department?"
No.
What you said was that was where you were gonna look for one.
"Oh, that's right, sir."
Right.
And you didn't wanna jump to conclusions.
No good detective should.
Was there anything on the gun?
"Anything like what, sir?"
"Fingerprints, what else?"
"Oh, right."
"No, I don't think so, sir."
The lab is still running tests.
"By the way, sir, why do you think he put the gun back and threw away everything else?"
Perhaps because he didn't have time to get rid of the gun safely.
Guns are very easy to trace.
And the prop room may have seemed the safest place to him.
Close.

You wanted to know when the truck came in.
How's it look?
I had this little premonition some of it survived the journey...
- I guess they didn't.
"- Gladys, call the insurance."
"Hey, thanks for telling Joe."
What are you talking about?
He bought me champagne last night.
Champagne was his idea.
The back half of the truck is all perfect.
"We got, like, ten tons of good fruit back there."
Thanks.
"I guess some things can be saved, and some can't."
"Tell me, Tommy, I need to know."
What would you do?
I didn't go to business school.
All I got is my gut.
"Right now, I trust your gut more than my M.BA."
"Sarah, what is it?"
"Saul, I love what our family has built here, and I wanna keep it alive, not just for us, but for all the people who work here, people who trusted this family, who trusted this company."
I have the number here of a U.S. Attorney.
"I'll do it your way, six months."
"But, at the end of six months, if we haven't found our way out of this, I will call him."
OK.
Isn't it true?
"Every time I see him I wonder, ""he should've washed, he hasn't again."""
"I know what you mean, he doesn't seem to be neat."
He's like the coal maker's daughter who doesn't wash her neck.
I like it.
Maybe he just looks that way because his neck is a bit long.
I know!
But it doesn't look like he cleans that long neck!
"But still, he's really popular."
I wonder about that.
"He's too plain, there's nothing interesting there."
An actor needs to have an aura or force about them.
For example?
So Ji Sup.
It's Mr. So again.
But why were you late?
"Right, it's the first time you've been late since I started working here."
Did you overdo it last night?
- I didn't order this.
- You ordered the curry.
"No, I ordered the pork cutlet."
"I ordered the pork cutlet, so why are you giving me the curry?"
- You ordered the curry.
"- No, no, you got it wrong."
You must've switched our orders with another table.
You ordered the curry.
"Yes, you did."
I did?
"Yes, you ordered the curry."
I heard it too.
What are you talking about?
I definitely ordered the pork cutlet.
Should have told me you were doing this.
I didn't have the time.
I was with George until one hour ago.
You spent the day with him?
"Yes and every night this week, so far."
I am becoming the expert in George Browne and the Blackmire Group.
"I could be making living at it, no?"
You are doing some very risky things without telling me.
And I have serious concerns about that.
You don't want me to tell you what he is doing?
You don't want... the briefcase?
I want you to inform me of when you see him before you see him.
And I want to debrief you at regular intervals.
You are working under my direction.
Do you understand that?
"Well, if I am working for you full time... then I need to get paid for it."
"I still owe money to Katarina and... if I can't work for her because I'm working for you, then... she needs to get paid."
And... you need to leave.
He is going to be here in 5 minutes.
We'll talk about all this tomorrow.
You're gonna call me first thing.
"- That is him now, probably."
- Is the wire up and running?
It will be.
Come on up.
"In the morning, first thing."
Take the stairs!
"There's not much here, just some small talk."
"No mention of the Blackmire Group, at all."
Then they get into bed.
Did he mention anything about his briefcase?
He wasn't interested in his briefcase.
And you were the only person who didn't even seem to care.
"People I barely knew were coming up to me all concerned... and you, you acted like you barely even knew me."
"I know, I know I acted like that."
I just didn't know what else to do.
I knew I was the last person on earth you wanted to deal with.
You were the only person I wanted to deal with.
"I wanted to talk to you, too, it just seemed like... you wanted help from everyone but me!"
- l was really scared.
"- l was, too."
I know we have different friends now...
- but sometimes I miss you so much!
"- Me, too."
It really hurts.
Squeeze my hand as hard as it hurts.
You're in my light.
So Sharon's dad is going to be okay.
I heard.
Your friend Rickie told me.
"I was just over there, at Sharon's, I ended staying a pretty long time."
is there some reason you think I should care about this?
I don't know.
You two are friends.
"I guess. I mean we're not, like, really friends."
"But you've been hanging out with her, right?"
Look.
"It was just... she needed me, I mean, not me, but somebody, anybody."
"And I just happened to be there, and we just, so, we just hung out... or whatever, I mean, it could have been anyone."
"No, that's not true, it doesn't work with just anyone... I mean, some people... I think she needed you."
Why?
Because of certain ways that you are.
"What, did you give this thought or something?"
Brian!
"Ah, ah..."
"Wow, my favorite little kids are not so little anymore."
Are you staying long this time?
He's not staying.
"Kayla, Jared, go get ready for bed."
I'll be there in a minute.
I want him out of my house now.
The only time you ever go over my head is because of Michael.
"Jackie, calm down."
What problem are you bailing him out of now?
It was a misunderstanding.
Always is.
"He was trying to do the right thing, he ended up a murder suspect."
A murder suspect?
"We have the killer in custody, Jackie."
He didn't do it.
"Of course he didn't, but how does he get in these messes in the first place?"
And with you dragged into it?
- This is different.
- Is it?
"I mean, his whole life has been one bad decision after another, always knowing that you're gonna be there to save the day."
People change.
"Leon, you have fathered him long enough."
When are you gonna let him stand up on his own two feet?
"He's getting ready to open a repair shop, Jackie."
His repair shop.
And two years ago he was going to finish college.
"A year before that, he was, he was selling that, that, that miracle drink."
"Well, at least he's trying, Jackie."
He's come a long way from where he was.
You do not need to remind me where he was.
"You know that I love him and I always will, and I had to let him go and I ju..."
- That's where Daddy is.
"- Allie, she is so much better."
She's finally on the right combination of meds.
She is seeing a shrink that we adore.
So then why didn't you tell me that she was coming home?
- Because I knew you wouldn't come.
"- Yeah, but you knew I was bringing Luke."
"- I'm telling you, Allie, she's healthy."
- Really?
"When healthy people come home, you don't usually remove the doors."
"- Okay, she's better."
- Until she's not.
"- If you'd gone to see her, you'd know."
- What am I supposed to tell Luke?
- He doesn't...
- You don't have to tell Luke anything.
"We'll just have a nice, stress-free dinner."
"This is a huge transition for her, coming home."
"Please, just don't stress her out."
I just wanted him to see we could be a normal family for five minutes.
"Well, that's about how much time you've got."
Hey.
"Hey, so are all the doors in the door shop?"
Because they're all off their hinges.
That's not the only thing that's off its hinges.
"Oh, I think I hear Daddy."
"Okay, okay, there's no way I'm staying in your room."
"There are no doors, except the bathroom, but that doesn't have a knob."
"You can't lock it, and there's a hole, so anyone can see inside."
How am I supposed to go to the bathroom?
"Trust me, that is the least of our problems."
It's kind of a big problem for me.
"You're going to need money for rent, for living expenses."
"I can help you now, if you want."
Ten quid.
What are you saying?
I was just going through the role of the MOMT in your adjustment to life after prison.
"Nice meeting you, Lindsay."
"We both have such busy schedules,"
I don't think the taxpayer will mind.
Shame I'm going to ruin the evening.
"Right, well, you know you can speak freely."
I can't tell you how to run your department but I want you to move Steve Arnott on.
Make him some other department's problem.
Let me tell you about Steve Arnott.
"He's my most dogged investigator, he will not leave a stone unturned."
I had intended that meeting in a more social setting would make this less confrontational between us.
"Yeah, well... .. we've only just got started."
I would like the chicken liver pate and the sea bass.
I'll be right back.
Thanks.
And I'll have the soup followed by the sirloin steak.
Medium well.
And... no sauce.
What's the matter?
I'm a married man.
Separated.
I took vows.
I can't undo them.
"Don't you want to stay with me, Ted?"
"I'm sorry, Gill."
I'm sorry.
I don't need to watch this if you want to put something else on.
It's fine.
Sex with a human. it's beneath us.
- I feel dirty by association.
- No of fence taken.
"You know, if it had been one slip ..."
But it's turned into a full-blown affair.
He has feelings for her.
Found these in his desk.
They're from her.
They've been writing to each other for months.
- On paper?
- It has to stop.
"I'd kill the girl myself, but we Light Fae really are supposed to frown on harming humans."
"How generous of you, Olivia."
But you're unaffiliated.
It would be so nice and uncomplicated for you to get rid of her.
What are your rates for exterminating?
"It wasn't a coincidence that I ended up in bed with you, was it?"
I chose you because of the job.
My taste of you has convinced me you're strong enough.
"Well, problem, Liv, is that I'm not an assassin."
"One touch, and she's six feet under."
And you're for hire.
What's the issue?
"Oh, you know, how killing someone is wrong."
You're not hearing me.
I'm not gonna snuff out a life because it clashes with your drapes.
Fine.
"Screw the complications, I will take care of this myself."
We should probably find this Jenny.
And save her from a jealous Fury.
Yeah.
- So where do we find her?
And this isn't the first time.
"If she doesn't get regular treatment, she will attempt suicide again."
"And Hong Jin-chul has many problems, such as his lungs and kidney."
It's a miracle that he's even still alive.
He calls himself a doctor?
- Damn it.
- What?
Recruit circus performers?
How about setting up a funeral home?
We're all being punished by God because you all have no faith.
"I always asked you to go to church, but you all never listened to me."
No need for it all!
It's over!
What can we do with dying people?
They need to be alive at least if we're going to eat them or not.
The game's over if they die beforehand.
Since when have you gotten so smart?
"You got it all down, don't you?"
I'm not as dumb as you think.
I thought you were a complete bonehead.
I'm glad that you realize I'm not.
"Anyway, I could die earlier than I expected because of you all."
Living a 1000 years is enough.
"What, you bastard?"
How dare you talk back to me.
Stop it please!
There's still 15 days left.
It's not late to find more.
How can we look again in these circumstances?
We're even murder suspects.
"Yeah, I told you not to come down."
You said something right for once.
And I did go looking for someone to help me get away.
And I am glad that I did.
"Because if I hadn't, I wouldn't have found you."
But you already had a husband.
Not in my eyes.
My father arranged that marriage when I was 14.
Did you object to the arrangement at that time?
It didn't seem real at that time.
"Besides, in my family we didn't often object to my father's wishes."
Did you make any preparations to be married?
No!
I was in school.
I was learning about the world.
And then I realised that I wasn't going to be allowed to be a part of it.
"That my world, my life, had all been decided for me."
And so I decided to leave.
And I would do it again.
You would do it again with a dowry given to you by another man?
I was frightened.
What if things didn't work out with Jimmy?
My family would have disowned me.
I would have nothing.
Nothing?
"Actually, you would have $575,000 in a Swiss bank."
You doing okay?
"I don't know, sir."
She never told me about any of that.
"You know, you have your own trial to concentrate on."
"Don't lose sight of that, huh."
"God, I wouldn't even be on trial, sir, if she'd never told me she loved me."
"Will you excuse me, sir?"
I just...
Her and me.
"I remember when your coat used to be there, too, Mr. Nash."
I always used to hang mine next to it.
[chuckles] [chuckling] I guess you can tell by now I'm romantic.
You always bought her such pretty things.
Maybe it's not nice of me to talk about the dead.
"You gave me quite a turn coming in like that, Mr. Nash."
"But you had your key, and why not?"
You pay the rent.
"I could smell you'd been drinking... but who could blame you, with all your troubles."
You weren't even sore at me for trying on the coat.
[chuckles]
I guess you never thought I could look so good.
It's that blonde beaver.
It does something for a woman.
Even me.
Such a good father.
"It was so cozy, just the two of us."
Just as if it had always been that way.
And then she came back.
We heard them out there.
"Her and that Mr. de Mario, laughing."
It was shameful the way those two were carrying on.
It really hurt me to see the look on your face.
It was nice of you not to want to be present... when she came in with that boyfriend of hers.
You knew you could trust me not to tell her you were in the bedroom.
"Of course, I don't believe that you had anything to do... with what happened later."
"But you see, it's the police I'm worried about, Mr. Nash."
Maybe tomorrow they'll ask me about you.
So I thought if we could get together....
"You know... dinner for two, tête-à-tête."
[bell buzzing]
What Musa and I have struggled for is worth more than any one single person.
It's about our species' survival.
We've all had to make sacrifices.
"Now tell me, I was yours."
"The bond between Hunters is different, deeper than humans."
"We're not just family, we're inside each other, it's how we're made."
Losing you was the worst thing that ever happened to me.
Like a part of me was ripped from my flesh.
"And I never forgot it, Allison, never."
Not one day has gone past when I haven't thought of you.
You... are a part of me.
And I love you.
"I love you, too."
That hollow in your back is sacred.
That's where we carry our young in their native form.
You defiled it because you despise yourself.
I blame your father for that.
"Ted ruined you, Allison, and yet I'm the one you hate."
You were born a Hunter!
You know how you came to look like you do?
"I chose this body for you, a vehicle to keep you safe and strong."
You killed someone for their body?
For you!
I chose well.
- I was a child.
A baby!
- That baby would have died anyway.
"Its mother was a drunk, living in a slum."
I did it a favor and I did it for you!
Stop!
No!
There's water in the tap.
Because he wants to build up something new for the child.
"I need to leave him something, he says."
"That's how he is, my husband..."
"Not such a one as yours, who does not want it."
"But he's bound to notice it sometime, Mrs John!"
Will he?
- Yes!
"Only you and Bruno know about this, and he keeps his mouth shut."
My husband doesn't need to find out that that is not his child... nor mine... when I lay it in the cradle for him.
Mine?
"No, Mrs John, that's out of the question."
"But yes, it can be done."
"It will work out, it will..."
I've closely considered everything...
"I've read the books from the state library on childbirth, and I've sent you to the doctor to see that all is fine."
I've made good friends with the midwife.
"But Pauline, what could happen?"
"If one is so young, fit and healthy as you, one doesn't need to lose it like I did."
"No, Mrs John."
No can do!
But Pauline...
Both of you are helped by this.
Yourself and your Harald!
"When he asks you where the child is, you say that you've lost it, like what happened to me..."
But he won't ask anything.
"He doesn't want it, and neither do you."
You want HIM!
And without a kid he may take you back!
That's why he left.
Or do you want to go back?
"No, I don't want to go back."
"Isn't it true that you don't want the child, or did you never say so?"
She is our world.
A peaceful life.
No big wish list.
We were happy with what was given to us by God.
But...
We didn't understand what doctor said about her disease.
We understood only one thing.
It required lot of money.
"If we don't start the treatment soon, the disease will spread all over her body, and she will die."
"From then on, she fought the disease, and we fought for money."
All our savings were spent on her initial treatment.
The situation was out of our hands.
We had no money.
"Even now, we have no complaints on anyone except on our incapability to save her."
"The day she looked at us to save her life, we died."
"If the operation is not performed in 24 hours, she too will lose  die."
We had no choice.
We can't see her die.
"So, we sent her an orphanage, and dying before her."
Please don't mistake us.
We had no other choice.
You're often asking for charity.
Is this for you or for everyone?
For me only.
"So, you know the truth."
It's alright.
Father went to bring money.
He will bring it.
Operation will be over.
"It's you who said that if we get things very easily, there will no kick in it."
It's true.
"If death comes easier, there is no kick in it."
Oh man !
Have you ever had anything like that in your whole life ?
"If we were rich and didn't have to kill him, we could pay him just to make those cookies for us, all the time."
"Hell, what if the cookies are just the tip of the iceberg ?"
What if he makes brownies ?
"We get so fat, but it'll be so worth it!"
"Anyway, Let's just do it as we said before..."
"I would just run in there, blast him."
You bring anymore ammo?
No.
I thought you said you have some more.
Nah...
I just wanted to sound pro and said I did.
It's not like we're facing five or six jokers who shotgunned one of Chet's nightclub.
"Beside, I was trying to save up for the dresses."
Never got the hang of these.
"I must be tiring your bucket list, but I wouldn't sweat it!"
Where is that place again ?
What place ?
The place...where you said we can get the bullets.
I thought you had some.
I was mistaken.
I've got a pretty good steak knives ... just trying to help .
You go out the front door.
You hook a right.
"Then walk three blocks, straight down on this side of the street."
You can't miss it.
"I'll go, Daze."
Why can't I ?
'Cause you look 12 and I've ID.
They might actually check in this part of the town.
"Just keep an eye on him while I 'm gone, and remember what I said."
"What's the best shot you ever made, Tom?"
I don't know.
What about Mendenhour?
"If it was me, I'd say it wasn't much of a shot."
Wouldn't you rather shoot a Sharps.50 instead of that.45-.60?
"Those old buffalo guns carry better, but with a.45-.60... you can get rounds at any general store."
Keeps a drygulcher in business.
"Tom, on the killing of this kid..."
- that was quite a shot.
- Was it?
Two hundred thirteen yards.
What do you know about that?
What I just told you.
"You afraid of dying, Joe?"
"Yes, I am."
I am afraid of losing my ability to be able to come and go as I please.
Lose my freedom.
Not be able to get back up in those hills again.
What would they do to a man... that killed a 15-year-old boy with a Winchester?
I believe that man would have to die.
And you believe that a.45-.60 that's got a trajectory like a rainbow... could make that shot?
I know it could happen.
If I'd have killed that kid... it would have been the best shot I ever made... and the dirtiest trick I ever done.
"Hello, Sam."
I'm going to have to arrest you for the murder of Jimmy Nolt.
"Taking yourself kind of serious, ain't you?"
What are you going to do with that Winchester?
"We're just going to have to find out, ain't we?"
"Yeah, I guess we are."
"I'll take that rifle, Tom."
"Hello, Earl."
And the belly gun.
If they hope to continue Their hunt at sledge.
Rock and rock And rock and rock.
"If you don't find any gold,"
You can't call yourself a Miner.
"So if I can't find Anything new,"
Then there's no reason To keep doing this.
125 miles east...
Right now it's gonna tell us Whether we've wasted our time.
Or if we've made a good Decision And we're gonna get rich.
Fuel is back in the air pump.
And shawn is ready once more...
To hunt for elusive gold At the bluff.
I got a reputation to uphold.
"I come out here and fail, I'm gonna look like a fool."
I don't like failing.
Each expedition At the bluff costs thousands.
"And if shawn fails again,"
His plan for the empire Will be on it's last leg.
I'm here because I have a feeling.
That there's a lot of gold Here.
I just have a feeling.
My gut tells me That I'm gonna find.
Some nice big chunks Of gold today.
"I mean, I've been to the bluff Multiple times and failed."
"But every time you go back,"
You're hoping You're gonna succeed.
You got to always stay Positive.
"Ooh, here we go."
Do or die.
Here we go.
"I think we're gonna find Something really,"
Really good down here.
That's right.
Spotters never raise the bet or play any kind of progressive system.
"That's how we stay under the radar, and that's why we never get caught."
Exactly.
"Okay, they're just sitting at the table, betting the table min, and they're keeping the count waiting for one of these decks to get hot."
Right.
"And then when one of the decks gets hot, the spotter at that table signals in the big player."
This...
Mustard.
"Give me the mustard, honey."
Please.
"Well, I'm always the mustard, so..."
"When I get the signal for the hot deck, I stumble over like some drunk rich kid, or some zoned out dot-com millionaire, and I throw down big money."
So the big player bets big and still keeps the count.
"When the deck cools, he cashes in."
It's not as easy as it sounds.
"Oh, yeah, it's not, you know, because if Grey Poupon over here ever loses the count, it's up to his table's spotter to give him the signal to get out."
"- And you know the signals, right?"
- Yeah.
Show us.
"Okay, what's this?"
- The deck's hot.
- Right.
We need to talk.
The deck's cooling.
And get out.
Get out now.
Good.
I think he's gonna be ready for our little trial run tomorrow.
There's a trial run?
- Where?
- You'll find out.
There's something really cool.
"But it's so cool we just can't show it to you."""
"So,it's the easy viewing that's bothering you?"
No.
"Look,I'm sorry."
"I grew up looking at my dad's ""Playboys"""
"from the '70s,okay?"
Real boobs and shag carpeting.
"Times have changed,Augie."
Girls have gone wild.
That's exactly my point.
I don't think that the porn industry
- should be dictating fashion.
"- Okay,well, my point is that I don't care if I painted it blue and hung shingles on it, you should never ever walk away from it."
Ever.
"Dude,what's your problem?"
"I don't want to,like,open an old wound or anything."
"What would his fans think if he sees me and,like,bursts into tears?"
That you're the bitch that dumped him on his birthday.
- We should leavave.
- No.
What if he is the one?
Or what if he's not and you're just supposed to get back with him long enough so you can break up with him on Christmas?
So he can put out a holiday album.
Guess I'm just looking for an obvious sign.
Freaking psychic.
Women with acrylic nails always screw me over.
"All right,I'm running to the little girls' room."
Try not to be anyone's muse.
# And you think love is to pray #
# But I'm sorry I don't pray that way #
# Once I ran to you #
- What time is it?
- It's very late.
"David, I'm sorry to awaken you, but..."
I feel that we need to talk.
"Doctor, we have talked."
How many times do you need to come here?
"I've told you I don't blame you for what happened, but that doesn't give me my hand back."
Whether you blame me or not makes no difference.
"It's you, David."
"You see no future for yourself, and that gnaws at me."
"Your concern is admirable... but there must be better ways for you to spend your time, because I don't give a damn."
You have a very special gift.
"Had, Doctor."
Had.
I'm very tired.
Good night.
"You know, you're being much too harsh on yourself."
You mustn't think that you failed.
But I have.
The boy's a graduate ofJuilliard.
He just embarked on a promising career.
"I reach out to him... but no matter what I do, I cannot get through."
- That's not your fault.
"- Oh, isn't it?"
"We both know that there are other doctors here more able to... show compassion, provide comfort."
I have no magic words.
I work my wonders on flesh and bone.
I perform no... miracle surgery on the soul.
That's-That's your department.
"Major, I know how difficult it was for you to come here."
It's obvious that you care a great deal.
- Of course I care.
When you're around Like 30 feet of water.
You're on the edge of the first And second atmospheres.
Then you have to deal With the possibility.
"Of, like, nitrogen narcosis."
And the bends And that kind of thing.
Say there's like 5-ounce-an-hour gold.
"At 45-feet out of sledge Island,"
Then I want to dive it.
"So if I'm doing deeper dives, Then there is that danger Factor."
Where you could get bent.
"And if you get bent Or something like that,"
You may or may not be able To get back to town.
"If there's an accident, And you're."
All right.
I'm headed down.
I don't know what I'm coming down on.
"Kind of murky, And I'm pretty deep here."
All right.
Weird.
It's like a field of loose Gravel and small stones.
I don't know what it is.
"From the side of the island, I don't know."
You're about 34-feet now.
Copy that.
I never forget How dangerous gold mining is.
In pursuit of Our objective... gold...
We forget how dangerous What we're doing is.
"When I'm on zeke's boat, I'm terrified for zeke."
"He's a crazy diver, He works really hard,"
"And that could definitely, Like, enhance the impact."
The pressure that depth Has on you.
"I mean, this looks like The kind of place you see gold."
He was a good man.
He never did anything to you.
That's a dead body.
"Now, let me see."
That's an alien craft.
That's an alien craft?
Isn't it kind of small?
"The alien craft is about the size of a dinner plate,"
Who ever told you that aliens need as much space as people?
"Well, that's really quite a world that you showed me."
You're a scientist as tall as the empire state building.
and the aliens are as big as...
Jumbo shrimp.
I've available no other world to show you.
"Well, isn't it possible that that might be a child's toy?"
And not a UFO?
"Don't worry, forget it..."
"We'll leave this fucking place, baby, and we'll go to Berlin."
I wanna sing in the night clubs.
Germans love me...
We'll be happy.
What are we gonna do with this body?
Don't worry about the body...
"I know what to do, you wanna do it right now?"
Are you sure this has something to do with the UFO?
Looks like two women just killed a man.
This is not my first encounter with the aliens.
Just watch in the long run you will see what happens there.
Why don't they call the police?
Why don't we call the police?
They don't want the police to be involved.
Why?
Maybe.
But I'm gonna be honest with you.
I used to deny that I was sick.
"I would go off my meds, not work my program, try and white-knuckle it."
And I thought I was gonna spend the best years of my life in a psych hospital.
But I committed myself to recovery.
"And, no, I don't always like going to group."
And I hate that I have to check in with my psychiatrist all the time.
And I certainly don't like the side effects of the meds.
But it works.
And it is so worth it.
"I passed the bar, for God's sakes."
I'm living proof.
Of what?
That there is hope.
I forgot to tell you you were getting a visitor.
Imperfectly?
Of course.
Stupidly?
Sometimes.
"But we don't mind, because that's the way we're made."
"And when it's time to die we don't resist death, we summon it."
"This is not philosophy, anymore."
How are you here?
I found a cave.
"I went deep enough down to avoid the radiation that I now see, never came."
"After a few months, I lost track of time"
and then I heard you.
"I have one bullet left which I will use to kill you, if you need me to"
to stop you from commiting an act so unreasonable it might end the human race.
"So, can I just say?"
A tip of the top hat to our boy Chips.
The best relationships grow out of friendships.
"Wait, wait, wait."
Gigi.
"Wait, wait, wait."
What?
Now you and I are in a relationship?
"Well, I'd say if we're not at relationship station-ship we're at least on the track."
And why exactly would you think that?
Because of the signs.
"Really, like what?"
"Like, it was good to hear from me and you talked to me even when you were with a girl and I felt something."
"Oh, man."
What are you talking about?
"Gigi, what have I been saying since I met you?"
"If a guy wants to date you, he will make it happen, okay?"
He will ask you out.
Did I ask you out?
No.
Why would you do this?
"Oh, shit."
Why do women do this?
"Build up this stuff in their minds take each little thing a guy does, and then twist it into something else?"
It's insane.
I'd rather be like that than be like you.
Excuse me?
What is that supposed to mean?
I may dissect each little thing and put myself out there too much but at least that means I still care.
"Oh, you think you've won because women are expendable to you?"
You may not get hurt or make an ass of yourself that way but you don't fall in love that way either.
You have not won.
"You're alone, Alex."
I may do a lot of stupid shit but I know I'm a lot closer to finding someone than you are.
"That ain't the real Tom Horn, is it?"
He doesn't seem to be too scared of Corbett.
He's gonna get himself killed.
"Lord, the end is here."
- Is Tom Horn in there?
"- Yeah, he's here."
Last stall on the right.
But I wouldn't go in there with that horse if I were you.
That son of a bitch is harebrained.
He's got him trained to stand people off.
"Well, he's a hero of the frontier and he's lying here in Hagersville... with his face kicked in."
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.
How bad you hurt?
Wasn't much of a party.
"Say, you another one of those newspaper guys?"
"No, I ain't, but I'd like to get you out from under that horse if I can."
Open up that gate and I'll walk him out.
Let me ask you something.
- Are you in fact Tom Horn?
"- Yes, I am."
"Goddamn, Tom."
"You know, here in Jerkville, where these yokels... is busy flicking dandruff off their mail-order suits... they forget awful quick that it was men like you that made it... safe and possible for them to lead out their dull little lives."
"Right now, I wish I had nothing to do with it."
- What's your name?
- John Coble.
"What can I do for you, John?"
"Well, first, I'd like to offer you my ranch till you get recovered."
And then I'd like to offer you work... that suits both your ability and your quality.
"I'm a fair hand, and I'll earn my keep."
"Yeah, I know you will, Tom."
We better stop and water our horses here at Brown's Hole.
"It's all right to fight drew and vanderbilt, but you can't fight the public!"
They say you're swindling erie and everything else you can lay your hands on so you can get more money to squander on josie mansfield!
Keep josie out of this.
These fellas won't keep her out of it.
"Why don't you wake up, jim?"
Josie mansfield's making a fool out of you!
Hold your horses!
"I didn't think there was anything i couldn't take from you, but there is."
"Now, don't say it again!"
I wouldn't be your friend if i didn't.
Don't say it!
You can't get mad at me.
We've been through too much together.
"You don't know anything about her, so shut up!"
I'll shut up!
But you got to tell me what you're gonna do about josie mansfield!
I'll tell you what i'm going to do!
I'm going to marry her...
if she'll have me.
You don't like her.
That's all right.
But don't mention her name again.
You think she's in love with you?
I never figured i was much of a ladies' man.
"You've said that to me many times, nick."
But when a man feels about a woman like i do about josie... he begins to believe in miracles.
"You really feel that way about her, eh, jim?"
That ain't half what i feel about her.
I wish i could lay my hands on all the gold in the world just for the fun of making her happy.
"Maybe she don't love me yet, she likes me."
"That's something, ain't it?"
Sure.
"And let me tell you this, it's not a lot of fun in moaning menace."
*** system.
"It'll be strange around here if they go, won't it?"
Quieter.
"Oh, I know, I know, I've grown fond of having them here too, you know?"
Most of them.
But we knew the day would come they'd have to move on.
"I mean look on the positives, you will have the house back, and I can crack on with my round the world cycle challenge, you know?"
"And you'll have more time to spend on your, on your your, your things."
"Yes, you're right."
Let's get a cat.
What?
A cat.
Let's have a cat.
A cat?
Or a little family of cats?
"Just hold on a wee second, dear."
"You can't just do these things, you know, they need a careful thought."
I suppose you're right.
I can keep myself busy in other ways.
Take a more active interest in you and your hobbies for example.
Start spending a lot of time with you in your shed.
"Oh, I do love the sound of cat song."
Oh.
"How's it, uh- how's it going?"
I'm not permitted to discuss the process.
"No, no!"
"God, no."
"I just mean, you know, how are you?"
"Because I always think with these things, nobody ever really thinks about how hard it is for the assessor."
"Can be quite difficult, yes."
Today's proving very straightforward.
"Mike, tell 'em, German chocolate."
"That's cake, we're talking pie now."
Isn't he adorable?
"Mike, before we go to bed, will you read me a story?"
"Oh, come on, this has gone from weird to creepy."
"Victoria, he is not your father."
"Mom, he is not your husband."
"Hang on, Moll, they're just trying to make me feel welcome."
Which is more than you're doing.
You won't even let the poor bastard hang up a picture.
I didn't say anything.
"Plus, you're the one who told us to make him feel at home."
"I meant be friendly, make small talk, not dress him up like my dead father."
"Hey, it fits him."
There's three guys in Chicago that can wear that suit.
Then get one of the other guys 'cause this one's mine.
"You're so selfish, Molly, you never share anything."
Remember how she never let me ride her bike?
"Oh, hey, if I had lent you the ten-speed, we'd still be driving around right now looking for it!"
The two of you are giving me a headache.
She started it.
"So how come you get to dress him up, but I can't?"
Because I'm the one that's marrying him.
Is that a shot at me because I haven't found a man yet?
Have you looked in the garage?
"I'm telling you, Carl, it's like paradise."
Guess what I'm doing right now.
How'd you know?
"No, I mean, how'd you know it was pie?"
You cannot hear it in my voice.
"Fine, if you're so smart, what am I wearing?"
Wrong... green leisure suit.
"If we'd used sniper rifles, instead of driving straight at them, we could've picked them off easy."
"Jacoub, we're good if we stay in this direction, yeah?"
"Yes, that way."
There's no point rescuing Clare if we can't all get out again.
"You do want to go home, don't you?"
See your wife?
"That's a wedding ring, right?"
What about kids?
You got any of them?
"Okay, no kids, your marriage is shit, that's starting to make more sense."
Don't fucking shrink me.
You have no idea what the fuck you're talking about.
I know self loathing when I see it.
How reckless that can make a man.
That's why I'm here.
"Only I would have rescued Clare, not died trying."
"Now, we're professional fucking soldiers."
We've got a job to do.
You're not a fucking soldier.
"You're a scumbag arms dealer, selling mass murder."
"So yes, you should fucking hate yourself."
"That's why Clare hates you too, right?"
"But that's your shit to work out, not mine."
I don't give a fuck if she forgives you or not.
I'm here for one reason and one reason only.
And that's to get that information on Latif.
- No.
- Which I'm starting to think is just some bullshit story you're selling.
I'll keep my part of the deal.
"Really, Crawford?"
Redemption costs.
"And on my watch, you fucking pay up front."
You can't see anything yet.
You can't see anything yet.
"Straight at the back, so I can get my head..."
"Put a bit here, this is enough..."
Next you'll want a rose here...
"You must have it cut away here, you've got a short neck."
"I'll have it up to my neck here, smooth and towards the back."
You know what would be great?
A jacket.
"This dress will be sleeveless, won't it?"
But who'll sew it up in two days?
- l must have it ready.
- You'll do it.
And who'll go to school for me?
Work it all out and pin it up.
Why do you keep saying you won't dance?
Why do you think you won't dance?
"Because when I went to dance lessons, the girls danced mainly with girls, because there were too few boys, even on the ski trip I didn't dance even once!"
- There were no boys there!
- There were.
But there isn't one boy in our class...
"no, just one boy, and he wasn't there, and the others..."
"You're suffering from something, because that feeling..."
"You've got a complex, or something like that."
"Maybe I have, who knows?"
But I have a feeling I won't dance.
Why do you think that?
"Because I don't know how to charm anyone and I can't dance well, and I've never really tried it."
In what way do you mean charm?
By beauty?
You've got something else in you.
"You're friendly, that also has..."
"Look, I ain't never stole nothing."
I sure am sorry about Lee.
- He wasn't too damn bad a fellow.
- He's still with us.
He is now.
"Well, he weren't too bad a fellow."
Those are Coble's cattle you're running there.
Same old deal.
"Yeah, that's what I was afraid of."
"You get my note, tell you to get out of this area?"
"Yeah, I got your fucking note."
I rolled it up with some tobacco and I smoked it.
"That what I did, champion."
"You killed my horse, you son of a bitch."
- How are you?
- Morning.
"Howdy, John."
Gentlemen.
It's this Horn situation.
We got a problem.
You think maybe he might be just a little bit too protective?
You know we still got the Nolt sheep problem on the south fork.
But the rustling has stopped.
Yeah.
I think it's his rifle every bit as much as his reputation... that's done that.
It's almost a foregone conclusion that this fellow's working for us.
"You know, after that incident in town, we're just within one damn inch... of having our names splattered all over the newspaper... and I don't have to tell you what an embarrassing situation... that can put all of us in."
What do you suggest?
"John, we just can no longer afford this fellow."
"He's only doing what we hired him to do, you know."
The time has come for us to divest ourselves of this Mr. Horn.
How?
"Well, it's very simple."
Just do whatever it takes.
- It's that simple.
- Yes.
You can't fail if you don't give up.
"You know, being right isn't all it's cracked up to be."
And you can't try so hard to control it all.
"You know, life is pretty much in the grays for the most part."
"And if you insist always on black and white, you are gonna be very unhappy."
"That's a convenient philosophy for you, Mom."
"Look, I don't defend what I did to your father."
But the truth of the matter is that we both gave up.
"But now we are trying, we are trying very hard to get back on track by listening to each other, something we've never done."
"Honey, whatever you decide about Michael, talk to him."
As painful as it is.
Don't be so quick to walk away.
She's in her room.
People know the truth.
"They may not like it or want to know it, but they always know."
"Lie, and you will lose her."
It'll never happen again in my life.
I promise.
Why did you do something so awful to me?
Because I was scared.
Do you know what?
I don't want to hear it.
You said you're okay with having this baby.
"What am I supposed to say to you, Jenna?"
I'm terrified that my life is over?
I'm terrified because I don't think I'm ready to grow up yet?
"I mean, a guy can't say that to the woman that's having his baby."
- You would've never forgiven me.
"- Hey, Oz !"
- Ozmeister !
- [ Albert ]
"Oh, great."
- What about the game ?
- I'm not playing.
- You're missing the game for us ?
"No, I'm missing the game for you."
"AND THE PLAYWRlGHT WAS THERE, ""WHO BROUGHT THOSE CHlLDREN?"

"1080 01:32:08,519 --&amp;gt; 01:32:10,519 Really, I'm so sorry."

"1082 01:32:13,195 --&amp;gt; 01:32:15,513 Especially what Ender did for us,"
"1083 01:32:16,851 --&amp;gt; 01:32:18,718 it's a wonderful thing."
"1084 01:32:18,800 --&amp;gt; 01:32:22,300 Without thinking at all she helped Faruk."
"1085 01:32:22,709 --&amp;gt; 01:32:24,624 Thanks!"
"This is what I call a wise love 1086 01:32:24,800 --&amp;gt; 01:32:28,200 Think about it, 500000 USD 1087 01:32:28,300 --&amp;gt; 01:32:30,900 Who would give it to anyone nowadays?"
"1088 01:32:30,984 --&amp;gt; 01:32:33,704 Thanks to Ender we breathed deeply."
"1089 01:32:34,821 --&amp;gt; 01:32:38,418 Thank you very much to both of you."
"1090 01:32:39,200 --&amp;gt; 01:32:44,800 Friends are for days like this Sude."
Don't even mention it!
"1091 01:33:04,587 --&amp;gt; 01:33:07,706 Where am I going to put all this money?"
"1092 01:33:07,741 --&amp;gt; 01:33:11,132 I sent the demon away."
My luck turned around!
"1093 01:33:11,188 --&amp;gt; 01:33:13,549 We don't get the money we win 1094 01:33:13,554 --&amp;gt; 01:33:15,668 We put it in the contribution's case."
"1095 01:33:15,878 --&amp;gt; 01:33:17,665 Who says that?"

"There is something called your right dear, take it son, take it!"
"1102 01:34:05,541 --&amp;gt; 01:34:09,422 I am decimating here around."

"1109 01:34:50,200 --&amp;gt; 01:34:52,388 Finally I made it!"
"1110 01:34:53,654 --&amp;gt; 01:34:55,654 Thanks."
"1111 01:34:55,739 --&amp;gt; 01:34:58,024 You won a panda ."
"1112 01:34:58,100 --&amp;gt; 01:35:01,200 You must be joking!"
"1113 01:35:05,462 --&amp;gt; 01:35:08,129 You know that Selim did not know about the money?"
"1114 01:35:08,300 --&amp;gt; 01:35:10,100 You did not tell him, No?"
"1115 01:35:10,795 --&amp;gt; 01:35:13,436 How was I suppose to know that it'sa secret?"
"1116 01:35:13,517 --&amp;gt; 01:35:16,158 I wanted to thank him.I thought he knows it too."
"1117 01:35:16,800 --&amp;gt; 01:35:18,300 God damn you, Sude."
"1118 01:35:21,900 --&amp;gt; 01:35:24,300 500.000 dollars..."
"Ender... 1119 01:35:24,509 --&amp;gt; 01:35:26,867 I'm talking about 500.000 dollars... 1120 01:35:26,921 --&amp;gt; 01:35:29,467 More money that I earn in a year."
"1121 01:35:29,600 --&amp;gt; 01:35:31,800 I gave my own money.. 1122 01:35:31,990 --&amp;gt; 01:35:34,629 I don't care...Wherever it is from."
"1123 01:35:34,685 --&amp;gt; 01:35:36,686 How can you take so much money and give it?"
"1124 01:35:36,686 --&amp;gt; 01:35:39,015 I gave it to him as loan."
"Even if it's so, you did not tell me."
Why did you hide it from me?
Faruk didn't want the situation to be known.
"898 01:13:43,485 --&amp;gt; 01:13:46,715 Yes, you can dress up in my room, no one is upstairs."
"899 01:13:46,715 --&amp;gt; 01:13:48,000 Okay."
"900 01:13:54,342 --&amp;gt; 01:14:00,259 Mira, can you take Safari from us please?"
"901 01:14:07,638 --&amp;gt; 01:14:12,433 Okay."
"Safari, come here buddy."
Well done to you!
"902 01:14:14,700 --&amp;gt; 01:14:18,067 You won't be frowning like this all night, no?"
"903 01:14:18,067 --&amp;gt; 01:14:21,300 I am sorry but I am not in a good mood."
"904 01:14:23,000 --&amp;gt; 01:14:25,635 Do you know what is your problem ?"
"905 01:14:25,635 --&amp;gt; 01:14:31,900 You encountered love very early in your life, I mean each other.. 906 01:14:32,200 --&amp;gt; 01:14:34,585 It was the same with me too... 907 01:14:34,600 --&amp;gt; 01:14:40,000 but Faruk didn't let me from his hands."
We got married right away.
"908 01:14:40,135 --&amp;gt; 01:14:43,580 And this was the best decision in our live."
"909 01:14:46,100 --&amp;gt; 01:14:51,300 As child he use to say he would become an engineer, architect..."
Thank you very much!
"910 01:14:51,400 --&amp;gt; 01:14:54,232 I said, i wish, i wish... 911 01:14:54,232 --&amp;gt; 01:14:55,320 Ok, mom, enough!"
"912 01:14:55,320 --&amp;gt; 01:14:58,436 But now hope is born."
I know he will make it now!
"913 01:14:58,500 --&amp;gt; 01:15:01,900 She will be an engineer and architect, like you."
"914 01:15:02,000 --&amp;gt; 01:15:05,400 Hopefully!"
My mom is excited.
"915 01:15:05,483 --&amp;gt; 01:15:07,351 You should get excited, you."
"916 01:15:07,351 --&amp;gt; 01:15:09,749 Of course dear, make everyone be ashamed, 917 01:15:09,800 --&amp;gt; 01:15:14,500 Make gumtree (Great surprise) to those who say: "" He will be like his big brother"""
"918 01:15:22,600 --&amp;gt; 01:15:25,600 Come Safari.."
"919 01:15:32,800 --&amp;gt; 01:15:36,700 Run, come on."
"920 01:15:42,700 --&amp;gt; 01:15:48,100 Safari, come here please !"
"921 01:15:48,300 --&amp;gt; 01:15:51,200 Come on, let's go!"
"922 01:15:53,900 --&amp;gt; 01:15:58,900 Come here grass enemy, come!"
"923 01:15:59,100 --&amp;gt; 01:16:02,984 I am sorry, he escaped again... 924 01:16:03,000 --&amp;gt; 01:16:05,700 Safari loves us."
"925 01:16:05,900 --&amp;gt; 01:16:08,000 Hello by the way...- Hello.. 926 01:16:08,200 --&amp;gt; 01:16:10,300 Look, it's Yaman!"
"927 01:16:11,300 --&amp;gt; 01:16:15,300 I saw him."
Are you okay?
"928 01:16:15,800 --&amp;gt; 01:16:20,200 I am fine, what about you?"
"1128 01:35:51,860 --&amp;gt; 01:35:53,971 I'm not everyone, Ender."
"1129 01:35:54,100 --&amp;gt; 01:35:58,500 I'm your husband."
"1130 01:35:58,600 --&amp;gt; 01:36:01,800 You shouldn't hide it from me."
"1131 01:36:03,834 --&amp;gt; 01:36:08,559 Are you aware in which state did you put, to protect Faruk."
"1132 01:36:08,600 --&amp;gt; 01:36:12,800 Calm down, please. -..."
You didn't even deign to tell me
"1133 01:36:13,882 --&amp;gt; 01:36:17,550 Please!"
"1134 01:36:18,754 --&amp;gt; 01:36:21,352 My wife and I are talking privately."
"1135 01:36:22,273 --&amp;gt; 01:36:24,230 Of course."
"1136 01:36:41,111 --&amp;gt; 01:36:43,989 - Did you see my mom?"
- Today it's my day.
"1137 01:36:44,054 --&amp;gt; 01:36:46,362 Can you imagine?"
Eylül kissed me.
"1138 01:36:47,300 --&amp;gt; 01:36:50,400 - Mert, where are you?"
- I'm coming.
"1139 01:36:50,600 --&amp;gt; 01:36:54,600 I don't care about the name, She wants me."

"- Yaman 1152 01:38:02,400 --&amp;gt; 01:38:04,500 Don't be annoyed with me..."

"YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY HAD SAlD SOMETHlNG ABOUT SPEAKlNG BRlEFLY"
ABOUT COLLABORATlNG?
"HOW DO WE DO IT?  &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT'S THE HARD PART. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SAD ANSWER IS,  IT'S A GlFT."
I THlNK THERE ARE SEVERAL THlNGS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE SURE OF.
YOU HAVE TO SURE OF YOUR OWN TALENT.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE HAD RECOGNlTION AND FEEL SECURE.
AND YOU HAVE TO BE SURE OF THE TALENT OF THE PERSON WlTH WHOM YOU'RE WRlTING.
"AND IF YOU DO THAT, AND IF YOU'RE A COLLABORATlNG KlND OF PERSON... (chuckling) IF YOU CAN GET ALONG WlTH PEOPLE,"
IF YOU CAN GlVE UP SOMETHlNG YOU THlNK IS REALLY IMPORTANT
"AND ONLY FlGHT ABOUT THE REALLY, REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT THlNGS,"
"AND YOU TRUST THE TALENT OF THE OTHER PERSON COLLABORATlNG WORKS,"
"BUT THE PROBLEM IS, ALL TOO OFTEN, PEOPLE WANT IT THElR WAY."
"WE COLLABORATED WlTH A WOMAN IN CHlCAGO AND IT DlDN'T WORK AT ALL,"
BECAUSE SHE WASN'T WlLLlNG  TO GlVE AN INCH
"ON WHETHER YOU SAY THlS IS A ""TAXl""  OR THlS IS A ""CAB."""
"I MEAN, ON THE LlTTLE THlNGS-- AND IT DlDN'T WORK. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT WASN'T A COLLABORATlON.  &amp;gt;&amp;gt; NO."
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHlNG TO ADD TO THAT? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; UH...
NO.
"ONLY THAT, UH, THE WAY WE WORK IS..."
"ONE OF US WlLL WRlTE  SOME STUFF,"
"AND THEN, TURN IT OVER TO THE OTHER"
AND THE OTHER  HAS THE OPTlON
OF IMPROVlNG ON  WHATEVER HE OR SHE GOT
AND GOlNG ON FROM THERE.
AND THAT WAY-- ONE OF THE THlNGS WE WERE TALKlNG ABOUT EARLlER--
DEBBlE WAS TALKlNG ABOUT EARLlER--
IS HOW NlCE IT IS  WHEN PLOTS SURPRlSE YOU.
"AND YOU KNOW, WHERE THlNGS, YOU KNOW, COME UP UNEXPECTEDLY."
"WELL, THE NlCE THlNG ABOUT COLLABORATlNG  IS YOU SURPRlSE EACH OTHER,"
"SO IF YOU'RE ALREADY SURPRlSING EACH OTHER,"
YOU'VE GOT A BETTER CHANCE OF SURPRlSING THE AUDlENCE.
"SO, IT'S A LlTTLE LlKE CHEATlNG..."

In that case...
What if I go the other way?
"If I go here, will I live?"
I...
It's insufficient as much as I would thank you.
"869 01:11:20,359 --&amp;gt; 01:11:24,475 That day when police took me, I begged so much to Mr. Selim saying 870 01:11:24,475 --&amp;gt; 01:11:28,437 I entrust you my son."
"By God, God bless you!"
"871 01:11:28,500 --&amp;gt; 01:11:31,500 You're really good people!"
"872 01:11:31,700 --&amp;gt; 01:11:35,700 Mrs. Nevin, while you are here, 873 01:11:36,700 --&amp;gt; 01:11:40,400 I have a proposal for Yaman - Let Yaman stay here."

"877 01:11:55,400 --&amp;gt; 01:11:59,400 He can gain the possibility for a 100% scholarship 878 01:11:59,700 --&amp;gt; 01:12:03,000 This is it!"
This is it!
This is it man!
"879 01:12:03,010 --&amp;gt; 01:12:06,749 But if he isn't involved in trouble again... 880 01:12:07,600 --&amp;gt; 01:12:08,800 What do you say?"
"881 01:12:08,800 --&amp;gt; 01:12:13,800 What can he say?"
He says God!
Oh I thank you my gracious God!
"882 01:12:13,800 --&amp;gt; 01:12:15,300 Yaman."
"883 01:12:15,400 --&amp;gt; 01:12:19,508 What can I say, of course it's great, but only if it's 100% scholarship, 884 01:12:19,508 --&amp;gt; 01:12:20,971 if I succeed in exam 885 01:12:21,000 --&amp;gt; 01:12:23,758 You will succeed dot com dot tr (.com.tr)."
That's all!
"886 01:12:23,800 --&amp;gt; 01:12:27,500 As school is close to here you can continue staying here now 887 01:12:27,600 --&amp;gt; 01:12:30,400 No, I will come and go."
"888 01:12:31,200 --&amp;gt; 01:12:35,400 Here is the possibility for you."
Work and win!
Ok?
"889 01:12:35,500 --&amp;gt; 01:12:37,200 Okay..?"
-Okay.
"890 01:12:37,400 --&amp;gt; 01:12:42,100 My God, what kindness did I do for you that you brought these people in front of my son?"
"891 01:12:42,200 --&amp;gt; 01:12:45,500 Ah thanks God!"
Thanks God!
"892 01:12:46,800 --&amp;gt; 01:12:49,600 God bless you..."

I earned my honor and bread with my voice.
"855 01:10:14,500 --&amp;gt; 01:10:18,500 When you were young you won a voice competition..."
"856 01:10:20,200 --&amp;gt; 01:10:23,269 err...in your childhood...I mean when you were major 857 01:10:23,269 --&amp;gt; 01:10:26,800 Be ate ease my kid, of course in my youth, I have wrinkles now 858 01:10:26,904 --&amp;gt; 01:10:31,871 Not at all!"

"- What a 865 01:11:03,000 --&amp;gt; 01:11:07,800 I couldn't imagine a place like this even in my dreams."
Can one escape from here?

Hey!
Lee Tae Ik!
Are you trying to stingily save money?
"No, no!"
It's because it is good.
I like that pizza best.
This and... give us this.
We purposely came all the way here.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;Please give us a lot of topping.
Also give us a lot of hot sauce and pickles.
"Whatever, give as much as possible!"
We are regulars.
"Also, give us garlic sauce."
"Anyway... just to get 30% discount,&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;we went all the way there?"
"Hallyu star, Take One?"
Hey!
"Baek Go Dong, don't just eat."
You must never tell about this to anyone. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;It's such an embarrassment.
I also think so.
So what?
It's good to save money.
What is he doing?
The pizza will turn cold.
It's almost ready.
"Hurry and come, hyung!"
"It's so good, looks like we will finish it all."
Leave mine!
Put on the TV.
"Yes. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I met with world-famous star, Jin Se Ryeong.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I see. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Let's go to that scene! &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;As the first Korean to do so,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;you won the prestigious supporting actress award in the States.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;How do you feel? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I'm happy. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I see. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Sometime back, you even got a love call from world-famous director, James Wang.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Please tell us of your upcoming plans."

We were watching it well.
It's not interesting.

Octavius has broken his pledge
"lmperator, go to Rome!"
Take your grievance to the Senate
"Strike, first, that's what you said, isn't it?"
A civil war?
"Romans against Romans, Antony!"
You must talk to the Senate!
"Take the world, before it takes you?"
We'll not wait for Octavius to come to us
We'll go to him
"Your fleet, my queen, there, is Octavius"
"More than an equal match, I think"
I don't like it
"What don't you like, General?"
"It's a bad business, attacking by sea"
"lf we really mean to defeat them, we should do it the Roman way strike quickly, by land!"
"Octavius has us blockaded inside the gulf, General"
We have no choice We must fight our way out
"But General, it's full of dangers"
"The enemy is upon us, comrades"
Prepare your stations
It will be decided here
May the gods favor us
There's Marc Antony's ship
Faster!
Faster!
Marc Antony thinks this is a cavalry charge

He's going too fast!
He's too far forward!
"It was the USDA that, sort of, came up with the idea of working on pennycress."
And he's going to tell us a little about how they got started and where they are now in the research side of things.
"But before we get to Terry, I'd like to introduce our overhead..."
"Dr. Bill Bailey, he is the director of the School of Agriculture."
"And he has some welcome words, I guess."
William Bailey:
Words of welcome.
A big decision I was involved in was whether or not to have coffee or cocoa or chili today.
We opted for the coffee.
Welcome.
You're part of a historic event.
Truly historic.
"This is the first Pennycress Field Day ever, in the history of the world."
"Right here, at Western illinois University."
So cutting-edge stuff.
"We're very pleased that you took the time to come here and share some of Win's work with him,"
It's exciting stuff.
It's new stuff.
It continues to the tradition that he started here at Western of looking at new ways and new crops to help
Illinois farmers make money.
"So I'll turn it over to you, Win."
Win Phippen:
Thank you.
And I'll turn it back to Terry.
Terry Isbell:
"This is a fun project, because as Brad knows, I've got one answer:"
"""I don't know."""

"Dr. Terry Isbell, US Department of Agriculture"
Terry Isbell:
"I stick with it really well, don't I, Brad?"
We started working on the probably in about 2002.
"I could compare the process of  goal-setting with a matrioshka: one goal in another, and so they go on; there are many of them, they accumulate."
"And paradoxically in contrast with  this Russian doll, there is not always reduction of size, they could be of the same size."
But they are inserted in one another  and overflow from each other.
The second very important thing:  museum process and museum activity are more important then the final result.
"We don't seek this result  but we go forward to it, always by making goal-setting."
"And finally, the most important resource for museum activity which is not always estimated and used  is cooperation."
"It is a valuable resource  which needs much openness and, believe me, really less money."
So my appeal to the community:
Let's become more complex!

"Yeah, in the fridge."

[Donovan]
That's what he just said.
[Julian]
"Yeah, I just want some ""melk""."
[Josh]
"Nah, you're saying it wrong."
"You're saying ""melk""."
Like it's a disease.
(Laughs)
[Donovan]
How do you say it?
[Josh]
I'm saying it the way everyone oughta say it.
"""Milk"" M-I-L-K"
It works fairly well for typical cases.

David:
"Over 6,000."
Elisabeth:
"Over 6,000?"
"So, there are plenty of people, um, experiencing this as well, like you do"
"So, can you just explain for everybody exactly what being an asexual actually means and how it is to live that way?"
David:
An asexual person is someone who doesn't experience sexual attraction.
David:
"So, the way that, you know, most sexual people walking down the street and you see someone or you're in a relationship with someone at some point, you feel like introducing sexuality into that."
That just never happens to asexual people.
Joy:
And is it a problem?
David:
"No, it's not a problem."
Joy:
"So, then, why do you need to organize?"
[laughter]
David:
There's a lot of things that are not a problem that you can organize around.
"We need to organize, well, partially, because it's not getting talked about."
"Because, um-"

"If you're not talking about sex, what's there to talk about?"

Thank you!

I feel happy as long as somebody is watching me.
I am happy as long as my customers are happy.
I love the feeling living in mountains.
Also I am quite interested in my own cultures.
Every single ceremony gives me another different feeling.
Since I began to work as a guide
"Of course, I started to have some students, five or six,"
Which made me so proud!

This is what delighted me the most.

"""Gaurabde ha!"
"O, Lord!"
I'm helpless.
"Save me""."
"""I'm helpless, I'm [soheart??]-powered."
In my home I'm in the midst of so many enemy in there.
In the hand of my enemies.
"No, no freedom."
I'm [clotery??] under control of so many enemies in the form of friends.

"I may be slave, eternal slave, impossibility of getting of [position??] unique to me."
"Now I find this helpless position, my Lord."

Otherwise no.

I was struck that these students knew more than I did.
I was in med school and was one of the best in my class in Uppsala.
But these Indians knew more than I did.
"I was thinking, ""This can't be right."
"They're Hindu!"""
"""They have caste marks and limited schooling."" But they were brilliant."

The instructor questioned us on renal cancer.
"After the fourth question I couldn't answer any more, but they knew more."

It was an awkward moment and somehow it led to a kiss
But we're both single consenting adults and if we choose to move forward as a couple

"I assume most of the people believe that now, but that answer is wrong."
"Your time is--in Berlin, I assume, very limited, so if you want to see the Egyptian stuff, you get that information, now, you're ending up in the wrong museum."
Thanks. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Okay, so what was the right museum? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; PAARGlA:"
It's in the so-called Old Museum and Altes Museum.
It's very close to it... &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Okay. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; PAARGlA: ...but the Pergamon Museum is, as far as I know, not known or famous for Egyptian stuff."
It's famous for something--other things.

Or will she yell back?
"Do you have a personal relationship, Hugo, with Lady Gaga? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KELVlN:"

That's right!
"So we may finally realise your vision... of uniting the east and west in a new Golden Age of light, of love, and dominion"
Antony!
Let me and my men come with you
"No, I need someone here I can trust"
You'll see that the Queen is safe?
On my life
These are just ornaments
"Still, Octavius will not have them"
"Your Majesty, this is the whole list?"
You must complete this side
Yes
Where is Caesarian?
I haven't seen him of late
People are dying because they drink their neighbor's waste.
The water is so unclean that it contains your neighbor's waste.
This is hard for many environmental enthusiasts to grasp.
Climate change overwhelms them so much that they forget reality.
They forget that two million kids die of diarrhea due to unclean water.
It's horrible that we don't have clean drinking water in the world.
And that we have air pollution because houses don't have chimneys.
That contributes to childhood pneumonia.
It's a major environmental problem.
"At the same time, I say the climate is the biggest environmental threat."
But not the biggest environmental problem - it's a future problem.
You have to think several thoughts at once.

"Well, I still form relationships."
Asexual people have the same emotional needs as everyone else.
"So, I still have to think about forming relationships."
I just don't have to think about forming relationships sexually.
I have to think about how am I going to start a relationship without something else?
How am I going to form intimacy in a way that isn't based on sexuality?
Star:
Help me with this.
Because what you seem to be describing is more of a choice.
Than an orientation.
"Intially, I thought you were describing an orientation."
David:
"No, I am describing an orientation."
Star:
But you know - consumer resistance against factory farming is steadily growing due to the increasing awareness of the animal suffering that it entails.
And sometimes you come across people from an entirely different background who surprise you.
It was in America that I met a man who is known as the Mad Cowboy.
He was a factory farmer who got out of the livestock industry and went vegetarian around the time of the Mad Cow Disease crisis in Europe.
"Hi, nice to finally meet you."
Nice to see you're un-lost again.
"- Yeah, finally, we made it."
Welcome to my humble abode.
- Thank you.
It's nice and warm here.
This is on the farm.
"And this is one of the dogs we had, which was Sam."
Good critter.
That's the farm ...
"I'm a fourth generation farmer, rancher, feedlot operator from Montana."
"At one time I had 7000 head of cattle, 12,000 acres of crops and 30 employees."
I spent 45 years of my life in production agriculture.
Not something I learned from a book.
I learned it by doing it.
I was a factory farmer.
The worst of all.
"Not a family farmer, but a factory farmer."
Never met a chemical I didn't like.
We'd actually grind up animals and feed them back to our animals.
Had all of the bad habits ...
What are you doing here?
- Branding.
- Ughh.
See there.
I've branded hundreds of thousands of animals.
It's still allowed in America?
- Absolutely.
They said he was a geek.
"Some kids had told him he was worthless, to go hang himself, and I think he got to the point where enough was enough."
"Tonight, a tragic situation."
"A Perkins boy, just 11 years ago, believed to have been desperate enough to take his own life."
This is an awfully complicated and difficult issue.
"Kids will be kids, boys will be boys."
They are just cruel at this age.
"Here what we get is, nothing's wrong, we didn't do anything, everything's fine."
"They punch me, strangle me, take things from me, sit on me."
Give it to him hard.
He is not safe on that bus.
I have been on that bus.
They are just as good as gold.
My voice is not going to fall silent.
I will go to my grave until a difference is made.
"We reached out to parents who have lost kids, parents of kids that are being bullied all over the world, and it took off like wildfire."
All it takes is for one person to stand up.
Be the difference.
"Go out and find that one child, that new kid standing over there by himself."
Be willing to stand up for him.
Everything starts with one and builds up.
"Eventually, we have an army."
"If we all do it together, we will change the world."

I was an average street magician
Famous magicians all have their special tricks
Doing magic with doves and cards
I sat freeze
I heard some poor guy standing near the candy machine got hit
"When I bite into a York peppermint Patty, I get shot"
"Okay, people, here is our problem."
The mayor was caught handing money to a known prostitute
You lost me my job
My lawyer says I have an open-and-shut case.
"See you in court, Sonny."
You cannot believe what I have been through tonight.
"I have spent the whole night, scouring the city, searching for the mayor"
"Hey, is that breakfast?"
There he is
Good morning people
"Alright, I'm sure we are all focused on the same problem, so let's get right down to it."
Mr Fluffy
"The children's zoo mascot, has recovered from mange..."
"And he's now available for petting, However, until he's completely out of the Woods, there is a 2-stroke maximum.**"
Mr Scruffy's speedy recovery is notwithstanding
"Mr Fluffy, Carter"
"I've seen him, Mike."
His fluffy days are way behind him
Don't we still* have that tiny problem of the photo of the mayor with the prostitute?
That's over with.
"I found the mayor, he's not with the prostitute last night. so our strategy in#### dealing with this is straight denial."
What do I say if somebody asks me about this
Tell theem you don't know anything.
But I don't.
But I don't know anything
Very good.
Hope you all learn from James
Learn what?
Will you stop showing off?
Star Wars!
That's a great one.
What else?
Student:
Rand al'Thor.
Brandon:
"Ok, Rand."
"Or basically anyone on a ""Hero's Journey."""
Student:
Frodo.
Brandon:
"You know, I honestly don't think Frodo counts."
"I think Frodo stays as an everyman, and I think that's perfectly plausible."
Frodo stays as an everyman.
Aragorn stays as a superman.
In the movie they move Aragorn from here to here.
But in the books he basically starts here and stays there.
And it's fine to do that.
Any three of these archetypes can work.
I like to put up spiderman here.
"Because he basically fits the perfect archetype of the everyman who becomes superman, right?"
And that's why his story is so compelling.
That's why it works.
But there are plenty of stories that work with the superman straight off.
"And we're talking... in this we talk about power level, which is not always the same way it is."
"There are plenty of books that are about, you know, the young woman who is not socially adept who becomes super socially adept."
And this is the same sort of archetype.
Or stories that start off with somebody being perfectly socially adept.
"I mean, Oscar Wilde's characters are all basically social supermen, right?"
"And we like reading about them because we're like ""Wow, I wish I could come up with rhetoric that quickly in the middle of a conversation."
"I love this character."""
They're still going to have a growth arc.
"Sister, are you gladyou'll see him again?"
No.
Why is your faceso sad?
sister dear sister do not do this...
There is nothing worsethan running away from your feelings...

good morning Nurten good morning Orhan
I was going come to you.

"No, he's very sick,still sleeping...hardly slept a little last night."

This is what we willexplain to the court
"Come to my office,I will give you the necessary paperwork."
Son...will Mahir be able togo to the hearing? no mrs.
"Feride, did you talkto Ms. Nihan?Will she come?"
For today's hearing willneed to have very strong nerves!

"I still think it's better this way,this time he would not has tostand in front of you and make youeven more nervous."
"Feride, are you okay?Can I do something for you?"
Or are you just upsetfor the hearing?
"See you at the hearing,Turgut."
Mr. Attorney!
"I heard that Mahir Karawill not attend the hearing,do you think it's a good or a bad thing? my dear"
"This is our favor,Of course, because a pencilwill be broken today! we will revengeSuleyman's death today!"
Mahir Kara will not comeand no one will be influencing the decision Feride!
"Where is the son in law will he not come god , god"
"(imitates crash) Oh, (bleep)in' balls!"
I'd better get the rest of the day off.
-You see?
And that's why I always warn people.
This is what happens when you go out and get a real job.
People get hurt.
But you know what doesn't hurt?
The comment question of the day.
That segway made no (bleep)ing sense.
The comment question of the day comes from  a user named NycKiko and she said...
-What would be the last words you would say right before you died?
"-So, if you were about to die, what would be your last words?"

"my name is Martin Lazarr, i'm a neurological surgeon and I approve of Alpha Brain and it's formulation"
I've been a neurosurgeon since 1973
I moved to Dallas for training
Today we're going to begin focusing on theories that are primarily concerned with environment and how they influence organizational effectiveness and survival.
"These theories are called resource dependence theory, network organization, and new institutional theory."
Baby blue is so last year
"Thank god, I brought reinforcements, front color, top shelf"
"Okay, this is ugly, who would want to wear this"
Everybody after we do
"You know, I think I'm gonna go bare."
I'm gonna create a naked zen millenium kind of a look.
Genious.
Thank you
"Okay, check it out."
I spent all morning covering these things.
I was so exhausted goes like manual labor of it all.
Broken a nail.
I decided
"Nick, no way, my dad will kill me if he finds that I'm throwing a party"
He doesn't have to know.
He would be out of town.
He's always out of town Brooke
"The first party of the year creates the social Siberia, and I, for one, do not intend to be left out in the cold##"
"Besides, if you back, we will be wearing Monica knee-pads for the rest of the semester"
You're right
Of course I'm.
You're so right
Hi
"Hi, I'm here with Thomas"
Tom
So yh
Talk about your self and how long you have been breaking and how you finding it so far
I have been breaking for 3and a bit years so since October 2008 and
I first go into it at university and the first time I saw breakin was with bboy Diggity
He was our first coach he is a crazy guy neat moves and everything is good so yh good
How you finding the society and how has the society developed over the past few years
Bigger
I graduated from high school and went to college and business school.
"So, you know, it's important to get ahead in life."
"Sarah Lee keeps up the family tradition by attending the children's storefront school in Harlem, where at first she is a standout student."
"And to everybody who knows her, Sarah Lee is a leader, highly motivated, and highly verbal."
She can really hold a conversation.
She will talk to you.
"You say, alright,"
Sarah just a minute.
Just take a break for a minute.
"Go get you something to drink or get a fruit or something, just to hush her up for just a few minutes."
"[INAUDlBLE] been in the store, right?"
Yeah.
For a long time.
Told you.
"Feelin' it, feelin' it."
But in the fourth grade something changes.
She got real shy in history.
She wouldn't participate in classroom activities in history class.
She wouldn't come with the answers.
She would do her homework but it would take her a little longer.
So she got tired of being slower in the work.
"And she kept saying, mom, something is not right."
"Like, I couldn't understand."
My comprehension wasn't well.
And my vocabulary wasn't well.
And my reading skills wasn't well.
Her teacher also notices a puzzling difference between Sarah Lee's personality in class and out.
By nature she's very energetic and outgoing socially.
"But in class, a lot of time, it's the opposite."
She'll listen and she's not a behaviour issue.
And she'll sort of look at you and focus right at you.
"But I always wonder, you know, how much she's really absorbing."
When I lost my virginity
You walked in mid-lose
That was an honest mistake.
Mom you stayed and talked.
She seemed a bit confused.
"So, you swear I didn't cause you any big problems here at work?"
Here's the morning papers with a big picture*
I read those yesterday.
Thank you
"Mom, you didn't cause me any problem"
There is no reason that you should feel bad about any of this.
"I just want you to know, the last thing I thought would happen on### my visit that I'd wind up sleeping with the mayor of New York City"
Did we forget to knock
"No, they're not my family."
They're just friends
"I know, bad idea"
"Stuart, I don't feel well."
"Stuart, I don't feel well."
Knowing about Mike's mom and the mayor is killing me.
"James, secrets are power."
"You get something good like this, sit on it."
"Right now, you leak it, it just office gossip that makes everyone uncomfortable"
"But, in 20 years, when Mike's running for president, this little gem gets me an ambassadorship to Sweden."
What do I get?
Topless postcard from Sweden
We just connected
The mayor is really an amazing man.
He's smart.
"He's funny, he's sweet"
I guess it's uncomfortable talking to your mother about sex
"No, mom, I've been looking forward to this day"
"Before I give them the last digit of my card number to confirm this ill-conceived and nonrefundable mistake### of a vacation,"
AB:
I'll talk to you later.
"In the meanwhile, let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little trickier."
"Let's take the largest number on the board here, 8649."
Would you each enter that on your calculator?
"And instead of squaring it this time,"
"I want you to take that number and multiply it by any three-digit number that you want, but don't tell me what you're multiplying by -- just multiply it by any random three-digit number."
So you should have as an answer either a six-digit or probably a seven-digit number.
"How many digits do you have, six or seven?"
"Seven, and yours?"
Seven?
Seven?
"And, uncertain."
Seven.
Is there any possible way that I could know what seven-digit numbers you have?
"Say ""No."""
(Laughter)
"Good, then I shall attempt the impossible -- or at least the improbable."
"What I'd like each of you to do is to call out for me any six of your seven digits, any six of them, in any order you'd like."
(Laughter)
"One digit at a time,"
I shall try and determine the digit you've left out.
"Starting with your seven-digit number, call out any six of them please."
Volunteer:
"1, 9, 7, 0, 4, 2."
AB:
Did you leave out the number 6?
"Good, OK, that's one."
"You have a seven-digit number, call out any six of them please."
Volunteer:
"4, 4, 8, 7, 5."
I think I only heard five numbers.
"They're gonna be talking about it, and I'm sure some of them are using it,"
'cause why else would it be on there?
"Now, Daily Microfoliant by Dermalogica."
"I've used this since it's come out, so for years and years and years and so has my husband."
"It is, like, our top favorite product."
It is good for men and women.
It is a daily product you can use.
"Hence the name, Daily Microfoliant."
"And, who uses it?"
"Dun dun dun dun, Oprah."
"That's right, Oprah, another queen here."
She uses it and you can see it's a little white rice powder and you mix it with water and--every day.
It's a very very very gentle gentle gentle daily exfoliant.
"So that's the Dermalogica, and, in makeup, what I have--"
I have Glo and I have the La Bella Donna.
"Now, the Glo Pressed Base is Hoda's favorite from The Today Show."
She loves herself Pressed Base.
This is the Honey Dark I have in my hand.
"Glo is great because there's Pressed Base, there's Loose, they have Satin, they have"
"Barely Beige, like a sheer type coverage, so a lot of options in Glo for you."
"La Bella Donna, one of my favorites, of course-- pretty much all these are my favorites-- is Bella Foundation."
"I use it on a daily basis, and they also have compact and loose, and Alicia Silverstone loves La Bella Donna."
"She loves the Brow Kit, which I will tell you about the Brow kit over and over and over because you get four colors in one compact, and this is the one for brunettes, so we pick your--you know your hair color."
Just pick the Brow Kit that matches and you're set.
Your colors are already picked out for you; it's like a no-brainer here.
"So, La Bella Donna, ooh, pretty four colors, I love it."
Love it.
"Now, last but not least, so you're using all of these products and you're like, yeah,"
I use these products.
"I do my skin care regime, I have the Fabulous Make Kit, makeup,"
I use it all.
I'm good.
"You are, you are in no condition to deal with this right now."
Pearl:
I'm taking my beer.
Tenant:
"Now just take your beer and get out of here, okay?"
"Yeah, we'll talk tomorrow."
Tenant:
This isn't over.
Pearl:
"Come, mommy"
Tenant:

Thanks Funny or Die.com.
Faults are breaks in the Earth's crust where rocks move past one another in some way.
Typically faults are associated with earthquakes.
We've called faults 'boundaries' in class.
"We've talked about divergent, convergent, and transform boundaries, but there are 2 types of common faults."
The first is a dip slip and the second kind is a strike slip.
Dip slips are in the top of the picture and this occurs when 2 pieces of land move vertically.
This leaves one of the pieces higher than the other.
A strike slip occurs when 2 pieces of land move horizontally.
Most of you would call this a transform boundary because the pieces of land move from side to side.
Welcome to the presentation on adding and subtracting fractions.
Let's get started.
Let's start with what I hope shouldn't confuse you too much.
This should hopefully be a relatively easy question.
If I were to ask you what one fourth plus one fourth is.
Let's think about what that means.
Let's say we had a pie and it was divided into four pieces.
"So this is like saying this first one fourth right here,"
let me do it in a different color.
"This one fourth right here,"
"It's good, but not great."
People say things that aren't true.
- It's never true...
- But they can make it bigger.
The following day...
They demand:
"""You who have knowledge, power and money"""
"""you must give all children a fighting chance!"""
"They fall down, stare into space and think:"
"""It will just get worse for the children."""
But raise your eyes and you'll see the statistics.
That's the world up there.
The world in 1959.
The ring corresponds to the bubble.
In London I lectured to hedge fund managers.
They're the worst kind of capitalists.
They wanted to know the exact condi- tions in every West African country.
"They know if there is sun, ore, oil, forest..."
They invest in Africa and want to know what country is most stable.
But the aid organizations have the same policy for everyone.
"The organization has an environmental, school or gender policy."
Then they pursue it in all countries.
To me it was horrific that businesspeople had a more fact-based worldview than young activists and university professors.
Dad was a coffee roaster at Lindvalls Coffee.
"Here, look..."
This is great...
"In this cigar box I have Dad's old club badge and five cents from East Africa, a coin Dad found in the coffee bags."
The raw coffee beans pass under magnets so all metal is removed.
They bring in huge amounts and inspect them carefully.
Here are coins from Colombia and Guatemala...
"Dad brought the coins home, sat me in his lap and got out the atlas."
He told me that the Africans didn't own their coffee plantations.
You shut up
"First, you owe us an apology"
"I apologize to you vey much, madame"
I even apologize on behave of everyone who hurted you
Thank you
"Second you'll forget all the money you gave Cobra and will pay us our own money no problem, sister just go up on stage thanks three"
What do I want?
I do not know you'll pay for the taxi to get us home at the end of the evening 2 taxis .. there are many of us
Ok sister
Crazy..
"He agreed to our terms quickly if so, we will go out on stage.. what can we do he granted all of our requests"
Ok dear sister here you go
Did you put salt in the coffee
No I added sugar
Oh! does he like it with salt?
No Nakiye it's a tradition to put salt in the groom's coffe well I don't believe in these traditions
"Nakiye, sit down"
I have to sit down .. right?
If you may allow me I would like to get into the main subject
You have seen our son
I have raised him well until he got to this age
And young people will not stay single
And want to get married mom stay in the main subject
"In short, they liked and loved each other"
So we want Nakiye to our son Shewket for marriage to Allah and His Messenger
What would you say Nakiye?
Do you need something Mr. Ethem?
"No he means, do you want to marry Shewket?"
I want to of course ..
I agree
"Then, it's done .. congratulations congratulations"
I kiss you congratulation my daughter
"Now I don't know where that point is, frankly."
But --
linear algebra will find it.
The main point is that the three
"planes, because they're not parallel, they're not special."
They do meet in one point and that's the solution.
"But, maybe you can see that this row picture is getting a little hard to"
see.
The row picture was a cinch when we looked at two lines meeting.
"When we look at three planes meeting, it's not so clear and in"
four dimensions probably a little less clear.
"So, can I quit on the row picture?"
Or quit on the row picture before
I've successfully found the point where the three planes meet?
All I really want to see is that the row picture consists of three
"planes and, if everything works right,"
three planes meet in one point and that's a solution.
"Now, you can tell I prefer the column picture."
"Okay, so let me take the column picture."
That's x times --
"so there were two xs in the first equation minus one x is,"
and no xs in the third.
It's just the first column of that.
And how many ys are there?
"There's minus one in the first equations,"
two in the second and maybe minus three in the third.
Just the second column of my matrix.
And z times no zs minus one zs and
four zs.
"And it's those three columns,"
"right, that I have to combine to produce the right-hand side,"
which is zero minus one four.
I won't lose someone again. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Young Master!&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Did you lose something?
What are you looking for?
I thought I lost you!
Young Master!
What's wrong with you?
I...
I don't want to lose you.
Have you eliminated all of Choi Chul Joo's men?
Yes.
"When the prince said that he was going to the harbor,"
I thought he was going to attack the people holding the ship to let it sail.
But this is what happened.
Now we have no way to obtain explosives.
The prince eliminated Choi Chul Joo so that we would not be implicated.
The police have finally reached the harbor.
Now we must give the Interior Minister a sufficient explanation for this.
"Choi Chul Joo used explosives to set sail, but the ship's owner Yongmun eliminated him."
"In the ensuing fight, all of his men were killed."
All of the men involved directly are now dead.
It is now impossible to identify the origin of the explosives.
Why did Yongmun kill the men with the explosives?
We were investigating explosives traders as you instructed us.
"As a result, we found Choi Chul Joo."
He had borrowed a ship from us to go to China.
Everyone is dead!
We cannot find out the source of the explosives!
We had no choice.
They had used explosives from our ship.
"If they had escaped to China, would you not have suspected us instead?"
"In addition, we did it to save lives."
We risked our lives to save the poor girls who were going to be sold in China.
They've succeeded - despite crowded areas and problems with hygiene.
Everyone has missed that because it happened slowly.
Journalists miss it.
You don't see things that go slowly.
It can pass through the studio unnoticed because it moves so little.
This is a 1967 issue of the Uppsala newspaper.
A slum was being torn down in central Uppsala.
Behind that window my mother grew up.
"It was called ""unplanned workers' quarters""."
"Gran lived there, so I've sat at that window eating soup."
She had an inner window and an outdoor toilet.
She moved in the late 1950s.
This is Grandma on the steps.
The picture was taken in the 1920s.
Grandma was born in 1891... ...when Sweden was somewhere between Uganda and Ghana.
Here she is on the steps.
She's actually showing her hair.
Otherwise she always wore a kerchief when she left the garden.
"Mom had tuberculosis and was quite ill, so I was a very longed-for child."
Which I realized later.
"When I was born, people questioned whether she should look after me."
When I was four she had another bout and I stayed with Gran.
But by then streptomycin had come.
"It came in 1949, when I was one."
It cured the disease.
Previously you were consumptive.
"Once a consumptive, always a consumptive."
I remember from Mom that it was very shameful to have tuberculosis.
Robert is in charge of the lighting.
"It shouldn't be a ""Welcome to this year's knowledge gala."""
The reception is upstairs.
"Then we go downstairs, Princess Victoria comes and the kids sing."
The quad is what I really like.
"For about ten minutes a day, every hour, people come together."
We're very diverse.
Absolutely beautiful.
"Fresh air, and the weather here's pretty awesome."
"The seasons, they're all awesome."
"It's a big University, but they still give you a sense of community."
Small but big at the same time.
You feel connected to all the students.
It has a small feel in a big place.
Hands down the best school.
Any interests that you have can be accommodated somewhere.
What I like about U.R.I. is they have alot of clubs that are specific to your major.
We have over a hundred different clubs here.
Making alot of good friends is fun.
"If there's something specific you want to do, you can probably find another group of active people who want to do the same thing as you."
"If you're looking for something, you can find it."
"Whether it's community service based, or maybe you want to be on student senate, or news paper, the year book."
The Ryan Center is a pretty awesome facility.
The concerts are getting alot better around here.
"I have alot of friends in the student entertainment committee, so I always get really good seats."
"I love my job, I work on campus."
"Over here, we have all of our U.R.I. merchandise."
"Sweatshirts, sweatpants, tshirts, beach towels for the beach."
You can go to the beach.
The closest one is probably
Narragansett.
Boston and New York are really close to U.R.I..
Newport's not far if you wanna go.
"This semester, I've been to the gym every week day."
Gym hours are very flexible.
"Everyone gets together, they do what they have to do."
"You don't have to talk to me, just wave if you are gonna give me a ride home?"
"And I realized I should be the one to take that hit, not Carla"
"Hey, Lindsay, don't worry, he is not allowed to talk"
Is that true
You may nod*
"You know, when I was 15, I cut my own bangs**"
"Oh that's right, Percival, it's a highschool hair story"
"Anyway, Judy Keenan told me that she would also cut her hair off, it was like a suicide pact, only with bangs"
"I cut off my hair, and of course, she backed out, but even though my bangs looked horrible"
"I kept them that way, mostly because those stupid bangs were the only thing in my life that I felt I had control over"
"I'm so tired of everyone telling me what to do, when to be home##, what to wear, when to take my medication"
"I mean, I'm the one who's sick, right."
I can handle my own life
"How about if I tell your parents from now on, prescriptions for your medicine will be given directly to you, you'll be in charge of getting your Dilantin taking it."
Thank you.
Great
"I don't have a ring, but you can kiss my ass"
Feared in grey?
Beautiful in blue?
Feared in grey?
Beautiful in blue?
"I'm gonna grab a fry, some ketchup."
"Ah, it's cold"
This is
I'm back
That was weird
"No, that was weird"
What were you doing
"That's all it was, and if you still need someone to blame, why don't you try blaming yourself"
You're absolutely right.
It's my fault you kissed my wife.
"Oh man, I'm going home"
"I know Bonnie is good, and Figsack has mad hands, but somehow I keep forgetting that Todd is a skilled surgeon"
"Hey, how come you didn't page me back about that surgical consult"
You're wearing your garage door opener on your hip.
"Ladies and gentlemen, number two"
Kelso is gonna kill me.
I can't find Mr Summer
Did you look* between Mr Spring and Mr Fall
Too easy.
You know what?
More armor.
"Actually, I'm sneaking trays out of the cafeteria."
I'm building a shed.
"This is partially your fault, so you're gonna help me find him"
"You know, whenever I lose something in the morgue, I just retrace my steps"
"Like right now, I'm looking for something, I know I came to the vending machine and then I dropped a quarter, which rolled over here and yep, there you are."
"As soon as you take your eyes off, and you lose them, they are like children."
"Big, dead children."
"Oh my god, I treated that girl at the free clinic, she was born without nipples"
I knew there had to be something wrong with her.
She's still perfect
"I was kidding JD, I've never seen her in my life."
Kelly Rippa!
(Elliot exits and Dr. cox enters.) I told you it would catch on.
I don;t think it's funny
How's that leukemia patient of yours doing?
I'm not hiding.
I don't really want to be bald. .
I have a sneaking suspicion it won't work for me.
It think it might accentuate my spoon chest*.
Plus the girl I'm dating is totally into my hair
She gotta be interested in more than just your hair
"If it weren't for your hair, I don't think I'd be remotely interested in you."
It's easy to make a family
"But what's important is, how this family will be you have to make great effort to keep it together"
Now you'll be both responsible for each other
I am sure you will do great
But you will also face some storms you'll have fights.. discussions.. all this might happen
But it is important to know how make up you have to yield for each other try to be silent when angry
If you do these things your ship will sail
If you don't we will always remember your words
Don't worry we will do our best to keep our family happy
God willing excuse me
For many years there was only one truth.

"We're gonna look at one more really interesting al-, algorithm that has, lots of important applications, called a Rabin Karp Algorithm."
Invented by two Turing award winners.
Michael Rabin and Dick Karp.
"I can remember hearing about this algorithm, from my friend, Dick Lipton, who explained it to me over the phone, and, I, he explained it to me in about, fifteen seconds, and I realized I had to have this, in the book."
"And, so now, here we are, presenting it."
"Th, that was, in the 70's."
"So the basic idea for the Rabin-Karp algorithm is, has to do with hashing."
"Yep, it's all here.."

"Ah, then should we try the ""yawning method?"""
Yawning method?
"So, now the word ""concluded"" is basically the same as ""to finish"" something."
"You start it and it's over, so therefore, it's concluded."
"Now, the second sentence we're going to look at"
Tariffs lowered on industrial goods and services.
"In this particular sentence, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Yawning is somewhat contagious."
"So if you see someone yawn, you find yourself following. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Just use that. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;You yawn during class. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;But if Seung Jo yawns after you, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;then that means he has glanced over at you. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;If he's not interested, why would he look at you?"
Yes!!

Is my lesson really that boring guys?
It's ruined.
I haven't suffered from anything so far.
I met my parents well (saying) so I've lived comfortably.
"Yeah, You and Me..."
I just lived off my greatness.
Since all the attention that was supposed to be pointed at the world was actually pointed towards me.
What do we do??
It seems we belong together more and more.
"That's when, Oh Ha Ni came to our house."
Looking at her...
I came to realize that maybe the world has different plans for me.
"And that is right, and maybe I'm wrong."
It was quite surprising
So I should experience the world more...
"I think about it often, lately."
"Anyways, thank you He Ra."
That I could talk to someone about this ...
It's a relief
"If you can forget me, try forgetting me... if you can forget me... try forgett-"
"Hey, Ha Ni ah!"
"I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold we'd fire no guns, shed no tears"
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier the last of Barrett's privateers.
Ladies and gentlemen...
At last we stood two cables away
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
Our cracked four-pounders made an awful din but with one fat ball the Yanks stove us in.
Goddamn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold we'd fire no guns shed no tears now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier the last of Barrett's privateers.
The Antelope shook and pitched on her side
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
Barrett was smashed
like a bowl of eggs and the main truck carried off both me legs.
Goddamn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold we'd fire no guns shed no tears
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier the last of Barrett's privateers.
So here I lay in my twenty-third year
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
It's been six years since we sailed away and I just made Halifax yesterday.
Goddamn them all!
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold we'd fire no guns shed no tears.

"Hey, look at this one."
This one's my project.
They surely don't wash his feet.
None of the things that a great aristocrat is supposed to do when a stranger comes up on their shores.
Even lowly ones should receive this treatment.
Remember what Nausicaa said when she saw
Odysseus at the beginning of book six.
He was basically dead.
He had no clothes on.
He was totally bedraggled.
He was in that beggar situation.
Even worse off than he is right now.
At least he has rags on when he approaches his own house.
"When Nausicaa saw that uh-huh, naked and destitute Odysseus, she said even this person deserves our respect because all guest friends come from Zeus."
"So she said in book six you got to be nice even to those lowly people, rode down to the totem pole."
But the Suitors don't have any of the graciousness of this.
They don't give him hospitality.
"They're busy you know, hoarding and taking Odysseus' goods without sharing anymore themselves."
"Page 366, that comes out."
"Then Odysseus, as he, as he works his way into this group has a chance to tell his story."
We've seen him do this in the context of
Eumaeus.
"When he offers a story, Eumaeus listens to all the details and makes a connection with them."
"Not so, with the suitors."
"Odysseus goes on, talks about being a"
Cretan sailor.
They don't understand the meaning.
"They don't understand that, yeah, maybe there's a stranger here we should be nice to."
They have no fellow feeling.
No linkage with Odysseus.
368.
"That comes off, they treated him very rudely."
Contrast this with what Eumaeus does.
Eumaeus is doing the right thing.
These Air Force guys.
"We can't pick a nice day - if it's windy we can't say, ""No, leave them float down there for a couple days."""
"So, they really practiced."
And they were good.
I was impressed with them.
The paramedics?
Yeah.
The Air Force.
They were before the Green Berets or before any special forces.
The Air Force had them in the 50s.
One other short one.
When I left Yemen when we flew back - we left Saudia Arabia or Beirut - and we flew back to the States so that was maybe 30 hours of flying time.
"30, 35 hours from Beirut back to Zl."
So they'd have a volunteer crew out over Christmas and single guys would always sign so that married guys could be home with the wives and kids.
So I signed up for it.
"It was like the 5th of May, and... went up to Pakistan up to Peshawar, where Gary Power, you know, the guy got shot down."
The U-2 pilot.
Yeah.
"Anyway, that was around that I happened to get on."
"Not a very particularly good run, because you're in"
Turkey and Pakistan...
"So, I couldn't even fly because I needed like 70 hours."
You could only fly 120 a month or 330 in three months.
So I was pushing my 120 hours flying time with getting back to the States... and then with this thing for a round trip.
So we get over there and spend the night there in civilian clothes.
"Normally we can stay in a pretty decent hotel but because it was Christmas Eve, they had us stay in the Embassy Compound because the Marine guards and everything like this just because there wasn't really any hostility with - animosity with - You weren't an American walking around on a Christian holiday, you know."
So we run up to Peshawar the next day
Christmas Day.
And had a load of stuff.
"Food, and, you know vegetables, perishables, whatever."
"Unloaded and they said, ""Hey, we've got a trailer over here."" It was like a 32 foot semi trailer and"
"""Can you haul that?"""
"I'll find a way, don't worry."
And...
I love people who keep secrets... who are silent until his death or be silenced by death!
You have a sister named Nurten!...
Ayten-Nurten ..
"She goes to high school, she's a very beautiful young woman..."
It is good to be careful because you never know that samething bad could happen but...
I'm sure you'll be protected!
yeah... but is Nedždet there?
I do not know.
"Is everything all right, young man?"
I'm looking for Necdet.
Me too. but he is not here.
ok
"My daughter, it was a lower class, but I wanted to set it to a higher level to fit accommodation in our society."
"For your sake, I chose not to respect your love for him."
I said to myself I will accept it for Feridie well to see a smile on your pretty face.
"But there have been other things, and the man was lying in the face manipulated you..."
"Now tell me, dear Feride will you accept the man who cheated and lied to you?"
"Maybe you're still confused that's why you went to see him in the hospital, but do not do it anymore, Feride.,"
You're not like that you are a person with dignity and pride even if it was love.
Can a person put their pride and dignity to a compromise?
This man does not deserve all your pain.
All these tears like that from you flowing drop by drop.
Is that what is broken.
"Him I can not never forgive, never!"
"Listen Feride, whatever is done I can not live without you, but please do not use this paternal feelings."
Whatever happened left behind in the past bury love and feelings in the heartand considers them dead.
"I do not want nothing from you,nothing else."

"There's definitely a method to my madness -- definitely, definitely."
Sorry.

"If you want to talk to me about ADHD afterwards, you can talk to me then."
"By the way, one last instruction, for my judges with the calculators -- you know who you are -- there is at least a 50 percent chance that I will make a mistake here."
"If I do, don't tell me what the mistake is; just say, ""you're close,"" or something like that, and I'll try and figure out the answer -- which could be pretty entertaining in itself."
"If, however, I am right, whatever you do, don't keep it to yourself, OK?"
(Laughter)
"Make sure everybody knows that I got the answer right, because this is my big finish, OK."
"So, without any more stalling, here we go."
"I'll start the problem in the middle, with 57 times 683."
"57 times 68 is 3,400, plus 476 is 3876, that's 38,760 plus 171, 38,760 plus 171 is 38,931."
"38,931; double that to get 77,862."
"77,862 becomes cookie fission, cookie fission is 77,822."
"That seems right, I'll go on."
"Cookie fission, OK."
"Next, I do 57 squared, which is 3,249, so I can say, three billion."
"Take the 249, add that to cookie, 249, oops, but I see a carry coming -- 249 -- add that to cookie, 250 plus 77, is 327 million -- fission, fission, OK, finally, we do 683 squared, that's 700 times 666, plus 17 squared is 466,489, rev up if I need it, rev up, take the 466, add that to fission, to get, oh gee -- 328,489."

Chechnyah
"During our journey in this show 'Travel with the Quran' we have travelled to many countries to spot light The Quran institutes.. to find the miracles of the Quran around the World. and amongst these countries, is the Country of Chechnyah."
Everyone knows that Chechnyah have been through many wars and it finally became stabilized 6 years ago
When i first decided to come to Chechnya - people thought that the war is still on!! even my mother asked me:
Isn't There a war in Chechnyah?
I replied to her:
"""No mother, Chechnyah is now stabilized"" after it was stabilized.. their main focus was on the book of Allah swt and they have a great Quran institutes now"
This is why we came here to introduce to you.. the Kids of Chechnyah and how well focused they are When it comes to the Book of Allah swt
"Also to show you the Quran insititues here which I am sure you will love, here in Chechnyah but while I was recording, those two young boys were heading to register for Summer Quran classes so I've asked them to join me"
"May Allah protect them and keep the Quran firm in their hearts, and may Allah preserve you all as well."

Spendin g that every year on your health care.
Just an outstanding amount of money and here's my last comparison.
"If you look at our health care spending in the context of the world GDPs, France is the fifth largest GDP in the world after the United States, China, Japan, Germany,"
"France, okay?"
They've got 66 million people.
This is their spending on everything.
"Vacations, education, the good French food, housing."
"Defense, cars."
They spend roughly what we spend at everything for 66 million people what we spent for 300 million people just on healthcare.
"In other words, if the US Healthcare System, with world economy, it's the fifth largest economy in the world, the sixth largest world economy."
Just an amazing amount.
If you look at China.
You know we're spending about 40 percent of the Chinese GDP.
Just on health care.
We're worried about them taking us over.
"You know, we should be worried about our healthcare system."
"Now, it's not just the level we need to worry about."
That's very high but if it weren't moving.
We can handle it.
It's also how fast it's growing.
"So, get your audience response clickers out."
"If health care inflation continues at the current rate which is the rate that's been going for about 30 years, when will one-third of the"
"GDP, that's one out of $three in your wallet go to health care?"
"We need music, we got to do the music."
The answer is.
Twenty to 30 or you guys are even more pessimistic than reality.
Alright.
"It's twenty, 40 round about."
"It's actually twenty, 37 and it obviously depends upon healthcare inflation but that's an outstanding number."
One of every $three.
What is the planting date? planting density? planting methods? the pollination systems?
What roles to bees play in pollinating this particular crop?
"We'll look at what is the impact of pennycress on soybeans, which is a crop that would follow pennycress."
And we'll have a chance to take a look at all of that tomorrow.
We'll offer coffee and doughnuts.
Beth Seaton:
Great!
Win Phippen:
And it starts at 10 a.m. and finishes at noon.
Rain or shine.
Beth Seaton:
"Are your students going to be out here, helping you tomorrow?"
Win Phippen:
The sure will.
"The students, they play a big role in trying to do these research plots."
"They learn how to develop a plant-breeding program, and develop a crop from essentially a weed."
Beth Seaton:
Who is invited to Field Day tomorrow?
Win Phippen:
The intent is really to introduce pennycress to the general public.
"Now, we've invited fellow researchers over from Peoria, who have been working on the crop. and industry folks, who have a vested interest in pennycress in the bio-fuels area."
"They'll be over to talk about what they're up to, in terms of building a bio-diesel plant."
"And local growers, who have had to chance, sort of, play with it, nd they'll give us some feedback on how well it went and some of the challenges they are facing in growing the crop."
Beth Seaton:
"Okay, well, we'll be back tomorrow to look at your Field Day."
I hope the weather holds out for us.
Win Phippen:
It sure will.
Thank you.
Win Phippen:
"So we've got some growers and sales folks, and the local support, chemistry support from the USDA."
I'd like to being the day first by introducing Terry Isbell.
"Well, here are her total reading scores."
"Last year in the seventh grade, she made a dramatic leap."
"Her comprehension score went from fourth grade, second month up to seventh grade, nearly a three year gain."
"What's very distinct in our community is a division between blacks and whites, right?"
"What, specifically, about the way that they speak?"
How does she feel about the way mama speaks?
"She feels embarrassed because, like, she's still using improper English."
She feels it's improper English.
Great.
What else?
What other issues about race have come up?
I definitely noticed a willingness in Sarah Lee to think beyond the first initial thought.
"She's starting to push herself beyond that, beyond cliches."
She compares how the schools-- the stamps are different from the schools.
She's highly intelligent and she's a good thinker.
She's capable of thinking through ideas.
But perhaps the best witness to Sarah Lee's progress is Sarah Lee herself.
Remember this moment from a year ago?
He used it in-- he used the gun to-- he used the gun to shoot place instead of shooting people.
I have matured a lot.
I have participated in my classes.
I've been behaving well.
I've been doing my homework.
My grades have been pulled up.
I've been working very hard.
"And, like, I've been overcoming the mistakes that I did many years ago."
It's clearly beginning to happen for her.
And I think this is going to be a wonderful year.
She's a wonderful girl.
And I think she will leave here and go to high school and college.
"And I hope that whatever her wishes are, they will be realized."
So far our journey through these young lives has been a difficult but mostly hopeful one.
They're the... our genre's most important things.
You need to make them feel alive.
You need to make them breathe.
You need to make them just realistic.
"So, let's talk about ways to do that."
First thing that we'll start to talk about is the concept of a sympathetic character.
Sympathetic Characters.
This is kind of the word that a lot of us use.
"Because, sympathetic is better than saying protagonist and antagonist, or heroes and villains."
"Because you want, generally, almost all of your characters to be sympathetic for one reason or another, ok?"
"Even your villains, the villains that you love, are sympathetic for a couple of... for some odd reason, and we'll talk about that."
"Let me throw it at your guys first who haven't taken the class before, since the rest of you know the answers to this, hopefully."
If you don't...
What makes a character sympathetic to you?
What makes you like a character when you're reading a book?
Student:
Some similarity between you and the character.
Brandon:
Ok.
You hit one of the big three right off the bat.
Student:
They have problems.
Brandon:
Ok.
Problems are good.
"Another way to put this is the ""underdog syndrome."""
"We like the underdogs, don't we?"
It's just human nature.
"Ok, what else?"
Student:
Consistency.
"I mean, they can evolve, but not be doing just random things."
"Oh, by the way, the Louvre was doing them too."
"Programs are now available, they are on art."
The history of art.
There's a group called Art Education for the Blind.
New York.
"They produce twenty volume set, with great photos in it."
Art history for the blind.
Cave art to the present.
It's spectacular.
A lot of people are getting hehind this evidence.
"This is not a practice or a fashion, this is evidence that this stuff works."
"And when you build a practice, a program on top of that to suit whatever needs you have."
Why do this?
"Well the evidence shows, raised line pictures can be used by the blind."
When they are drawing objects they show the shapes of objects.
The very thing you see.
And they have different levels of sophistication in their drawings.
Especially if they have only recently gone blind.
A child and an adult.
And I think
"Eriko and Esref's perspective and metaphor drawings are kind of ""firsts"" in art history."
"We had no idea, 20 years ago that any of this was possible."
And it's just spectacular that it is possible.
Thank you very much.

Constance:
So we have time for a few questions for Dr. Kennedy.
"Does anybody have anything they would like to actually comment on, based on what he said, or questions for him?"
"Anything you would like for clarification, possibility for your museum."
"Speak loudly, if you don't mind."
"I'll ask you to say your name, your organization and then ask your question."
And if you could stand up.
1979 I ended up paralysed from the waist down.
The doctor told me I had a tumour on my spinal cord.
"He said that if that tumour is on the inside of the cord, you have"
less than one chance in a million you will ever walk again.
"Made me stop and think for the first time in my life that I was part of the problem, not part of the solution."
"I saw the birds die, I saw the trees die."
I saw the soil changed.
And it was not until I was paralysed that I was willing to admit that I was the problem.
I ended up with a one in a million operation.
"I walked out of the hospital, with a one in a million operation, but I walked out a much different individual than I walked in."
"I knew that what we were doing was wrong, was absolutely, totally non-sustainable."
Here's a scone that my wife made.
Try that.
Vegan.
Everything in the house is vegan.
There's no animal products in anything that we have here.
And it tastes good.
Everybody thought the same way.
It was mass hysteria.
"Everybody was doing it, it must be OK."
You started and went on from the time you were a child.
"And can you imagine what it was like, when I first asked myself the question:"
"""Should we be eating animals?"""
It was one of the most thought-provoking questions
I had ever had in my life.
"Because I had never even considered that, and when you stop and think about it, it is so straightforward and open:"
"""Should we be eating animals?"""
Absolutely not.
"""Do we need them for protein?"""
Absolutely not.
"""Are they good for us?"""
Absolutely not.
He made it sound as if the coffee pickers were his colleagues and the plantation owners were the company director's cousins.
Once we attended a lecture series.
"I heard Rolf Blomberg, Eric Lundqvist and other adventurers."
Sometimes I saw a human vertebra on the necklace.
It was a human Atlas vertebra.
They wouldn't have a chance in a beauty contest.

Sten Bergman from New Guinea...
He was a bit of a comedian.
He showed a film where he put up an axe on a greased pole.
The natives had to try to take it down.
Dad was so upset that we left in the middle of the lecture.
It was so condescending.
Of course people wanted a good axe.
They shouldn't have to do circus tricks for it.
That attitude affected me a lot.
Dad identified more with the natives than with the explorers and the company head.

Do you see Sweden in the same way as you see other countries?
Sweden is an integrated part of the world.
"We have a tendency to see Sweden... ...as more ""permanent"" than it is."
"We speak of ""Swedish values""."
When I was in the student union in 1969-1970 we handled a secret fund where women could borrow money to go to Poland and get an abortion.
We didn't have abortion in Sweden in 1970.
Female students in Uppsala borrowed money from us.
Then they took the boat to Poland and got abortions.
That was Sweden in 1970.
Sweden legalized abortion a year after India.
Now we think it's a modern part of Swedish society.
"HerO, you know, I mean this is what happened, and this is what?"
The third game in a row now?
ZeneX Life is just really trying to kill him in about this time in the game and it hasn't worked out.
He is slowly building up a Corruptor count and kinda slowly moving towards that Hive tech.
But he is still on three bases.
"He needs to start taking more bases, it is obviously not working."
"-	There is 41 kills, 42 kills between the Immortals now, his micro has been so good with those, picking them up once again!"
"HerO, this is legendary!"
-	Unbelievable play by HerO.
Look at that!
These Immortals are living up to their name for the first time in Starcraft 2 history.
- 47 kills now and ZeneX Life continues to ride in.
"Still saving those Immortals, keeping those at the back."
"HerO, you are so good!"
"-	Ohh and he get one finally, but man!"
"This is a huge mistake here, ohh, Liquid HerO is getting a little bit far down the ramp, but he has got enough."
Nice micro with the Warp Prism again.
"Ohh, he gets the Warp Prism before the Colossus got down."
- And he kept the Immortal alive!
Just at the very last instant!
A 45 kill Immortal now.
- Target fire down these Probes to make sure that HuK cannot mine anymore.
"If NaNiwa can make sure that HuK has no more Probes left and no ability to make any more, the Stalker will be able to out micro the two Zealots all day long."
"With that being said, the Stalker is getting dangerously low on health."
"NaNiwa are still trying to target fire down those Probes, will it be enough?"
"The Probes getting so low on health, only two remaining!"
But the Stalker is getting so low on health.
NaNiwa has to be extremely careful if he wants to win this game.
"- This is coming down to the hit point bars, we can't let them go."
- Oh no!
The Stalker could get surrounded!
"- It is down to just seven hit points, three hit points."
"This is the first lecture in MlT's course 18.06,"
"linear algebra, and I'm Gilbert Strang."
"The text for the course is this book, Introduction to Linear Algebra."
"And the course web page, which has got a lot of exercises"
"from the past, MatLab codes, the syilabus for the"
"course, is web.mit.edu/18.06."
And this is the first
"lecture, lecture one."
"So, and later we'll give the web"
"address for viewing these, videotapes."
"Okay, so what's in the"
first lecture?
This is my plan.
"The fundamental problem of linear algebra, which is to solve a system"
of linear equations.
So let's start with a case when we
"have some number of equations, say n equations and n unknowns."
So an equal number of equations and unknowns.
"That's the normal, nice case."
And what I want to do is
"-- with examples, of course -- to describe,"
"first, what I call the Row picture."
That's the picture of one equation
at a time.
It's the picture you've seen before in two by two equations
where lines meet.
"So in a minute,"
you'll see lines meeting.
"The second picture, I'll put a star"
"beside that, because that's such an important one."
And maybe new to you is the picture -- a column at a time.
And those are the rows and columns of a matrix.
"So while I'm fighting in the war,"
"To Devil, Wife, don't open the door."
Comrade Army Commander!
"An urgent message, Comrade Army Commander!"
Zbruyevka's been freed by some avengers.
Some avengers?
Who are they?
- Nobody knows for sure.
- And if not for sure?
Have you contacted them?
That's impossible.
- Why not?
- They are not there.
- Who is not there?
- The avengers.
"- And Zbruyevka, is it there?"
"And then they'd tow the sharks back to Purteen Harbour, boil them up, use the oil."
"They also used the flesh as well, for fertilizer and also would fin the sharks."
This is probably the biggest threat to sharks worldwide -- the finning of sharks.
"We're often frightened of sharks, thanks to ""Jaws."""
Maybe five or six people get killed by sharks every year.
"There was someone recently, wasn't there?"
Just a couple weeks ago.
We kill about 100 million sharks a year.
"So I don't know what the balance is, but I think sharks have more right to be fearful of us than we have of them."
It was a well-documented fishery.
"As you can see here, it peaked in the '50s, where they were killing 1,500 sharks a year."
"And it declined very fast -- a classic boom-and-bust fishery, which suggests that a stock has been depleted or there's low reproductive rates."
"They killed about 12,000 sharks within this period,"
literally just by stringing a Manila rope off the tip of Keem Bay up in Achill Island.
"Sharks were still killed up into the mid-80s, especially out of places like Dunmore East in County Waterford."
"About two and a half, 3,000 sharks were killed up till '85, mainly by Norwegian vessels."
Once was real love and now it's fake
Who would've known this path we'd take
When it was good
We were sitting on top of the world
When it was good
No I never wanted nobody else
When it was right not like tonight
We were sitting on top of the world
When it was good
No we didn't have a cent to our name
When it was good
We were happy in the pouring rain
I wish it would would be that good

Hi guys.
"This is Max Tapper again, for Howcast."
What I'm going to do today is talk about a set.
"So, what exactly is a set?"
A set basically is just a certain number of repetitions that you choose to do in any exercise.
"So, say if I pick up a dumbbell and I want to work my chest and I'm going 10 to 12 repetitions, after 12 repetitions, that is one set."
Okay?
"Now, you can choose different repetitions for different reasons, depending on what you're trying to achieve."
Let's say your goal is just complete strength.
A lot of times they'll do six sets of repetitions.
"If your goal is to build muscle, like hypertrophy, then we'll work somewhere between 10 - 12 repetitions, and that's one set."
"If your goal is for endurance, then you're doing 15-20 reps, and that is still one set."
"So, a set basically is just a certain amount of repetitions."
That's all.
All right guys?
Get out there.
Do your sets and be safe.
(Music playing)
"So, let's say that you have some data now from the, from the sets of families I mentioned."
And this is what the family unit looks
like.
"Now again, we have the genotypes, just for"
"A and B. We don't know anything about C except, by virtue of disease status."
Okay?
"So, [inaudible] are Aa, ."
"So, you know, they're heterozygous for both the A and B markers."
"416 of them were healthy, and one was diseased."
'Kay?
So most of them tend to be healthy if you're heterozygous for both.
"Those are little a, little a, little b, little b."
"Most of'em, or actually all of'em in this case, are diseased."
"If you're big A, little A, little B, little B."
"So you're homozygous for little B, but you're heterozygous A marker."
"So, you're mostly healthy, there's a couple of diseased individuals."
"And this case, little A, little A, big B, little B, most of them are diseased."
"So, look at this just a minute, and speculate whether you think marker A is closer to the disease-causing mutation or marker B is."
"Again, remember mapping is looking for an association between genotype and phenotype, okay?"
"So what you wanna do, and looking at this right now, this is just like the problem we did in a previous video."
Look and see.
Does your genotype just at A predict the disease?
Does your genotype just at B predict the disease?
"All right, let's take a look now."
"So at A, just looking at A. Well, actually let's start with B, let's start with B. Just at B, big B, little B."
"So this one is big B, little B. Most, almost all of them are healthy."
"This one down here is also big B, little B."
Almost all of them are diseased.
"This one's little b, little b."
Almost all of'em are diseased.
"This one is little b, little b and almost all of them are healthy."
So b really doesn't predict the genotype very well at all.
[man laughing]
woman speaking native language:
There is a new one over here.
[man speaking native language] man speaking native language:
"Oh, gosh."
You have to pull on this one.
Can you manage it? woman speaking native language:
Nope. man:
You have to pull using your dorsal muscles. woman speaking native language:
It won't budge.
[man speaking native language] woman speaking native language:
IT WON'T BUDGE. man:
"John, it is necessary to address one or two shortcomings in, uh, the physical side of marriage."
"Surely no one would argue that there are certain physical demands a wife can request of a husband, and Ann asks you that you address these issues right now."
[laughter]
Do you agree to wash the windows inside and out?
[laughter]
man speaking native language:
It's like at the gym.
"You grab here, you grip there, and you position yourself with parallel feet so you can use your dorsal muscles."
Then you pull.
[woman laughs]
woman speaking native language:
"Oh, really? man:"
"Ann, John asks if you will agree to let him do that thing you once told him you would let him do on his 40th birthday, but still not have yet done."
[laughter]
"So, Ann, in anticipation of your previous answer,"
"John says, ""I suppose an occasional blow job is..."""
[laughter]
woman:
Are you trying every possible way?
I told you it won't move.
columns.
So I know how to get that one.
So what's the solution?
What combination will work?
I just want one of these and none of these.
"So x should be zero, y should be zero and z should be one."
That's the combination.
One of those is obviously the right
one.
Column three is actually the same as b in this particular problem.
"I made it work that way just so we would get an answer,"
"(0,0,1), so somehow that's the point where those three planes met and I"
couldn't see it before.
"Of course, I won't always be able"
"to see it from the column picture, either."
"It's the next lecture,"
"actually, which is about elimination,"
"which is the systematic way that everybody -- every bit of software,"
"too -- production, large-scale software would solve the equations."
So the lecture that's coming up.
"If I was to add that to the syilabus,"
"will be about how to find x, y, z in all cases."
"Can I just think again, though, about the big picture?"
By the big picture I mean let's keep this same matrix on the left
but imagine that we have a different right-hand side.
"Oh, let me take a different right-hand side."
So I'll change that right-hand side to something that actually is also
pretty special.
Let me change it to --
"if I add those first two columns, that would give me a one and a one"
and a minus three.
There's a very special right-hand
Upon recognizing her condition... ...I would have tranquilized her and force-fed her.
"And then, if necessary... ...I would've treated her with electroconvulsive therapy."
Electroshock treatment.
You would've done this against her will?
To save her life?
Absolutely.
Nothing further.
The witness may step down.
"Your Honor, I offer into evidence this photograph as People's Exhibit 3-A."
"And having done so, the people rest."
The photograph is entered into evidence.
"We are recessed until tomorrow morning, 9:30 sharp... ...at which time the defense will give its opening statement... ...and call its first witness."
I'm sorry I was late.
I didn't get a lot of sleep.
Big power outage knocked out my alarm clock.
- It won't happen again.
"- No, I didn't sleep either."
What kept you awake?
Doesn't matter.
You're under attack.
What are you talking about?
"You're in a spiritual battle, Erin."
The forces of darkness are trying to keep you away from the light.
Don't let them.
Don't worry about today.
We're doing fine.
We're getting creamed.
I can't believe I walked right into that.
"Look, if we don't find a doctor to testify that Emily... ...wasn't epileptic or schizophrenic or schizo-epileptic, we're gonna lose."
Care of the city's main branch and the university library... ...I bring you another dozen fun-filled books... ...about the demonic and the mentally deranged.
They burned women at the stake... ...during witch hunts for being possessed.
Glad you don't have to defend those guys.
I am gastronome.
I explore unique foods that are available to us all over the world.
"In 2002 I founded, as part of my work, a nonprofit organization"
"The Fruit Tree Planting Foundation,  whose goal is to plant 18 billion fruit trees  and nut trees all over the planet."
"We're at about 200,000 right now."
"And, that same year that we founded this organization, a wonderful organization  filled with amazing people,"
I ran into the most incredible fruit and nut tree in the world.
It is the source of the Earth's favorite food.
"That's right, the population of the world  has one favorite food."
"And of course, it's chocolate."
"Now, in my exploration of this I stumbled into it because I was a health food fanatic."
I never ate chocolate since I was fifteen years old.
This was about when I was maybe 32.
I stumbled into  this form of chocolate here.
This is raw chocolate.
"This is chocolate  in its unique original form, a form that is called -- by the British it is the slang word ""coco."""
But it's really cacao.
That's the real word.
"And is sometimes called a bean,  but it's really a nut."
It is the most widely eaten nut in the world that nobody actually eats.
I was in Hawaii with some friends.
We were peeling them.
They started  showing up in our smoothies.
"We'd get these coconuts,  we'd break up coconuts and make these incredible drinks."
We called them superfoods smoothies.
"And we started adding them to these smoothies and I asked my friend one day,"
"I said, ""What is this?"""
I didn't know what it was.
"And he said,  ""Oh, just peel the next one, and eat it."""
"So, I did eat it."
And that's what it looks like on the inside.
"And, at that exact moment that I ate that food,  I was touched by the spirit of chocolate."
I Kiss you sir congratulations
We want them..
We want them
Ok calm down.. they'are coming.. ok they're coming
Ok they're coming..
Ok..Ok calm down they're coming now
Applaud..
Applaud.. here comes the great artist
Thank you very much
How did we do aunty.. they liked us and who does not love a woman like me you fill the whole stage.. of course they'll love you you fill it so much that they can't even see the Kanoon player
"- Kanoon player how are you? - fine.. fine since you're ok then let's start 1, 2, 3,4"
Go ahead
Thank you you're welcome
I'll have my coffee then leave why the rush?
I'll go home and look on the internet for a home to rent since you're looking for a house for rent it means you're staying in Istanbul
No ..
Not for this reason
I don't want to be a burden on Mrs. Nesrin it's not nice
And if you see any house suitable for me just tell me
Ok .. what are you looking for?
"Not very expensive, small, doesn't have any problems no noisy neighbors.. would be enough do you have a friend for me I can share the house with her in fact there is"
Where?
Very close to here
Do you know the owner?
Yes I know him very well but is there a proper house in this area
There is
"Ok, can we go tomorrow and see it together in fact in fact we don't need to go anywhere because the house I'm talking about is this one it has many rooms Jeren"
Why don't you stay here? you mean to live together here
You said you need a friend in the house
I wish for you to live a beautiful and happy life
God willing
Now you have a big responsibility
There is also a beautiful rainbow in between.
Everything is just as he said.
But where is he?
He is not to be seen.
"Hey rain, are you pouring down only here.. ..or even at the place where he is?"
If you do so then he will think there is no rain.. .. and will not come.
Why dont you please rain at his place too?
"My dear, my cute rain!"
Please rain at his place also.
Do you believe at least now that rain unites both of us?
I already believe that.
It seems you did not believe completely.
Because you came so close but stayed that far.
Let the distance between the hearts melt slowly
Let me slowly open the door of naughty thoughts
The sky is sending down rain threads of love
And making a garland with rain drops as flowers
At this pleasant moment when it drenched us .. .. and joined us by the rainbow of love
With this rain as a witness.. .. let me proclaim that you are mine
With this rain as a witness.. .. let me establish this bond forever.
In your twists and turns I can see the beauty of lightning
I am seeing your spectacular dance in this first rain
I can hear your voice in this thunder
And do I hear your signals through.. ..the sounds of these rain drops
I am following the track of your heart
Shall I follow your foot steps as your wife
In this wetness when your shyness went away
Can any curtain stop your eagerness
I am gifting my beauty to your eyes
Let these rain drops show me your treasures
And let me remain indebted to the god of rain
I cannot stop the anxious youth anymore
It's really fast.
It's really easy.
"And in fact, voice search has become an incredibly popular application."
"Just to give you an idea, out of every four searches that we receive from Android devices in the USA, one comes from voice."
"That's 25%, which is pretty amazing."
So what I wanted to do today is actually show you how we're taking the voice UI to an entirely new level; through Cloud computing innovation.
Let me ask you a question.
"Have you found yourself, say, rushing at an airport?"
"You've got one bag in one hand, you've got a jacket or maybe, you know, a baby on the other hand and you need to send a quick text message but it's just too hard."
Wouldn't it be great if you could do it with just one single click?
Let me show you how you're going to be sending your text messages very soon.
Send text to Robert Hamilton: let's meet outside terminal
five in 10 minutes.
So this is going to process on the Cloud for a couple of seconds and then it's going to come back.
"So, let's see, perfect recognition."
Just nailed it.
And... &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"By the way, Hugo, the important thing is the computer was in the back room somewhere, right? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:"
The computer was in the back room somewhere. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
The computer--the computer was somewhere... &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
Not this back room. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
Not this back room.
The computer there was in the data centers.
You shipped it all the way somewhere.
"It did all that work, all the thousands of computers and it came back and boom. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:"
Yes.
That's exactly right.
"So, all"
"I have to do here, of course, is just press send and I'm done."
What you saw is called a voice action and there's a bunch of them in the new Android Voice Search application.
Let me show you another one.
Call Grand Hyatt Hotel in Berlin.
"We'll just have to take your word, won't we?"
- Your Honor.
- Mr. Thomas.
I apologize.
"Father, as Emily's parish priest... ...are you aware that she underwent advanced catechism training?"
Yes.
Yes.
Her family is very devout.
"And in that training, did she study Ancient Greek, Hebrew and Latin?"
"Yes, I think that's right."
"Might have even studied Aramaic, Christ and his disciples' language... ...which, according to the transcripts, we also heard on the tape, correct?"
She spoke Aramaic on the tape.
It wasn't part of her training.
But it was offered as an elective at her catechism school.
I have the school's curriculum here if you'd like to see it.
No.
I'll accept that she might have been exposed to that language.
"And according to her high school records... ...German was the foreign language she studied there, yes?"
I don't know.
If you say so.
"So that covers the strange languages we heard on the tape, correct?"
Did I miss any?
- No.
- Good.
We've already established you're no medical expert.
You said it's not your field.
But are you aware of the dual sets of vocal cords every human possesses?
- No.
"- Have you heard of... ...the superior vocal cords, which are higher than the ones we use to speak?"
No.
"So you didn't know that Tibetan monks, for example... ...as part of their religious training, teach themselves... ...to activate both sets of vocal cords at once?"
"No, I didn't know that."
"No soy, no rice."
It's made actually out of tapioca and arrowroot flour.
"I know that's not making your mouth water, but man, it is good."
Here is another example of where you can get your protein from.
This is a vegan sausage.
"It's about that big, the size of this remote."
There is 4 in a package.
Each one of these has 29 grams of protein.
"Again, the healthiest food you can eat is whole foods."
I don't mean the supermarket.
"I mean the fruits, the vegetables, the rice, the beans, stuff that's fresh."
That is not processed.
And the last thing I want to show you is another video.
It is a happier video.
And this is the whole idea of change in perception.
"I know I am keeping you here, longer than you probably wanted."
But this is a really beautiful story.
And I hope you enjoy it.
"On the night of September 18, 2007 a cow was spotted on the streets of Queens."
"She was tagged for slaughter, but she escaped that fate and literally ran for her life."
Police and firefighters captured her and brought her to Animal Care &amp;amp; Control in Manhattan.
"From there, Farm Sanctuary's rescue team stepped in."
Maxine's dash for freedom.
"There she is, beautiful girl."
"She was tagged for slaughter, and it would have been her fate."
But she wanted to live and so she really ran for her life. and now she'll live out her life in the Sanctuary.
It is interesting how the public responds when one individual animal makes a run for her life.
They end up making headlines on national news.
People's hearts goes out to this one individual animal.
The cruelty that happens to farm animals is largely hidden behind factory farm walls.
And people aren't aware of that.
"When you look in her eyes, everyone wants the best for her."
"Apparently, a quarter of men have a problem with premature ejaculation."
The rest of just don't think it's a problem.
"See, science isn't all progress."
What was wrong with train toilet doors that just locked instead of this multiple choice system.
"Now, if anything goes wrong, you're gonna be sitting there while the whole toilet wall slowly slides away."
And you're unveiled like a f* prize on a quiz show.
"For 500 points, a s woman."
Gordon Brown has got his big new idea.
He says that he wants to make children stay at school until they're eighteen.
"That's just not living in the modern world, is it?"
Seventeen year olds having to go to school.
Who's going to pick their kids up from primary?
He wants to bring in ID cards. with retina scans and 49 items of information.
"ID cards won't stop your identity being stolen, it just means that once it's stolen, you're fucked."
"""Oh, I've left my wallet in the hotel,"
"I'm going to need new eyeballs and a finger transplant."""
"Gordon Brown has seriously said, he wants listening devices put into lamposts to fight terrorism."
Is that how terrorists work?
"""Come over here, we must discuss our evil plans in this brightly-lit area."
"We'll sing them out like a f* barber shop quartet."""
Do you think George Bush even knows who Gordon Brown is?
He probably thinks Tony Blair's put on weight and has had a mild stroke.
See that bishop up North somewhere who said that the floods were God's judgement on homosexuals.
"If that were true, Brighton would be like f Atlantis by now."
I'm all for gay adoption.
Gay men would make brilliant dads.
They already know where all the best parks are.
They already know how to put talcum powder on to a sore bottom.
I'd have loved to have had a gay dad.
Remember all that stuff at school.
"""My dad will batter your dad."
"My dad could batter your dad."""
"So if you take the dot product with itself, you get 1."
If you take a dot product with some other guy in your set you're going to get 0.
Maybe I can write it this way. vi dot vj for all the members of the set is going to be equal to 0 for i does not equal j.
And then if these guys are the same vector-- I'm dotting with myself-- I'm going to have length 1.
So it would equal length 1 for i is equal to j.
So I've got a special set.
All of these guys have length 1 and they're all orthogonal with each other.
They're normalized and they're all orthogonal.
And we have a special word for this.
This is called an orthonormal set.
So B is an orthonormal set.
Normal for normalized.
Everything is orthogonal.
They're all orthogonal relative to each other.
And everything has been normalized.
Everything has length 1.
"Now, the first interesting thing about an orthonormal set is that it's also going to be a linearly independent set."
"So if B is orthonormal, B is also going to be linearly independent."
And how can I show that to you?
Well let's assume that it isn't linearly independent.
"Let me take vi, let me take vj that are members of my set."
And let's assume that i does not equal j.
"Now, we already know that it's an orthonormal set."
So vi dot vj is going to be equal to 0.
They are orthogonal.
These are two vectors in my set.
"Now, let's assume that they are linearly dependent."
I want to prove that they are linearly independent and the way I'm going to prove that is by assuming they are linearly dependent and then arriving at a contradiction.
So let's assume that vi and vj are linearly dependent.
Well then that means that I can represent one of these guys as a scalar multiple the other.
And I can pick either way.
"So let's just say, for the sake of argument, that I can represent vi-- let's say that vi is equal to sum scalar c times vj."
The woman paid him no heed.
"So, Indra, attracted, threw her onto the floor, and proceeded to rape her."
Then Indra disappeared.
(Clap!
Clap!)
"And the woman's husband, the Brahmin, appeared."
He realized at once what had happened.
"So, he petitioned the higher gods so that he may have justice."
"So, the god Vishnu arrived."
"""Are there any witnesses?"""
"""Just a one-eyed monkey,"" said the Brahmin."
"Now, the one-eyed monkey really wanted for the woman, a Sekhri, to get justice, so she retold events exactly as they had happened."
Vishnu gave his judgment.
"""The god Indra has sinned, in that he has sinned against ... a Brahmin."
"May he be called to wash away his sins."""
"So, Indra arrived, and performed the sacrifice of the horse."
"And so it transpired that a horse was killed, a god was made sin-free, a Brahmin's ego was appeased, a woman ... was ruined, and a one-eyed monkey was left ..."
very confused at what we humans call justice.
In India there is a rape every three minutes.
"In India, only 25 percent of rapes come to a police station, and of these 25 percent that come to a police station, convictions are only in four percent of the cases."
That's a lot of women who don't get justice.
And it's not only about women.
"Look around you, look at your own countries."
There is a certain pattern in who gets charged with crimes.
"If you're in Australia, it's mostly aboriginals who are in jail."
"If you're in India, it's either Muslims or Adivasis, our tribals, the Naxalites."
"If you're in the U.S., it's mostly the blacks."
There is a trend here.
"And the Brahmins and the gods, like in my story, always get to tell their truth as The Truth."
"So, have we all become one-eyed -- two-eyed instead of one-eyed -- monkeys?"
Have we stopped seeing injustice?
Good morning.
Let's try that again.
"Actually,"
it's right there.
"And of course, I don't have a sim card here, so it didn't place the call, but it's incredibly fast and this was a real live local search."
The number is not stored in my address book or anything.
It literally took half a second to find it and call it.
Let me show you another one.
"So, a friend of mine told me about this museum here in"
Berlin.
He said there's all this cool Egyptian arts there.
"So I want to drive there, but the name is very long, it's complicated, I forgot it."
I can't remember what the name of the museum was.
"Well, maybe I could do something like this:"
Navigate to the museum with Egyptian stuff.
And let's see what I get back here.
So it recognized what I said.
"So this is going to launch Google navigation which will figure out where I want to go and, in fact, it's right there."
It's the Pergamon Museum.
So I can just click on it and get directions.
So let's think about what happened here.
"So, first of all, my phone is with me and it knows that I'm in Berlin."
So it knows to search here.
"Secondly, there are thousands of pages on the web about the Pergamon Museum which obviously talk about the Egyptian art that's in this museum."
"So, all that Google has to do here is relate and connect all these pieces of information together and come up with a magical answer like what you just saw."
This is precisely what Eric means by Cloud Computing Innovation.
Let me show one more voice action.
This happens to be my favorite.
"Listen to Lady Gaga, Just Dance."
"So this is going to launch your favorite music application, in my case it's Spotify, and it will just going to play the song for you."
We'll stop that.
So those are voice actions.
They are
"Now, for the most important question:"
"Is Father Richard Moore guilty... ...beyond a reasonable doubt, of negligent homicide?"
"Did he, in fact, neglect Emily's needs in such a way... ...that her death is now on his hands?"
No!
That is not a fact.
It is not a fact that Emily was epileptic.
It is not a fact that she was psychotic.
Facts... ...leave no room for possibilities.
The only fact... ...the only thing I know beyond a doubt in this case... ...is that Father Moore loved Emily with his whole heart.
He did everything in his power to help her.
He has risked his very freedom so we could hear her story.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...in my job I sometimes have to defend bad men.
Father Richard Moore is not one of them.
Don't send a good man to prison.
I'm not asking that you believe everything that Father Moore believes.
I'm simply asking that you believe in Father Moore.
"Madam Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?"
"We have, Your Honor."
Please read the verdict out loud.
"""In the case of *The People* *v. Father Richard Moore*... ...we, the jury, find the defendant... ...guilty of negligent homicide."""
The court thanks the jury for its service.
Sentencing for this case will be set for April 3rd.
"Your Honor, if it pleases the court... ...Father Moore requested at the start of trial... ...that if found guilty, he would be sentenced immediately."
"Yes, I recall that."
Does the prosecution have any objection to expedited sentencing?
Very well.
"Father Richard Moore, do you understand this sentence... ...which has been found against you?"
"- Yes, Your Honor."
And do you understand the gravity of this crime?
"That you may, under the law, be sentenced to a term of up to 10 years?"
"Yes, I do."
Are there any statements you wish to make... ...before I impose this sentence?
Three hundred and sixty three...
Yes.
[Laughter].
Ok.
"These belong to some equivalence class, and we'll give that a name."
We'll call that equivalence class one third.
Are you with me?
Ok?
"Now, once you have that, then of course you can talk about fractions, right?"
"And then everybody knows how to work with fractions, which are really disguised ways of dealing with the equivalence relation that is embedded here."
What's the equivalence relation?
Everybody learns in grade school.
When are two fractions equivalent?
"I'll have you think about that, but the set of all such classes will be called Q, which is basically the set of all such equivalence classes... of pairs... of these ordered pairs."
Right?
What ordered pairs?
The ordered pairs in Z cross Z. Ok?
"We might have to be a little careful here, maybe Z cross Z minus 0... the set containing 0... period."
Ok?
Ok.
Everybody with me?
What have we just one?
I've just defined what I mean by Q. Right?
"It's an ordered pair, and... it's equivalence classes of ordered pairs."
"Now, what we haven't said is what the equivalence relation is, so..."
What is the equivalence relation?
"By the way, before we even talk about what the equivalence relation is, what's another thing you might want to be true about Q?"
"Aside from the fact that, you know,"
"I've just said that there's a set here, but somehow... how's it related to the set that I began with?"
"I might want to delineate that, I might want to tell you how is it that Q is related to Z."
"And usually, the way you think about Q, is that it somehow extends Z, right?"
"You have a bunch of points, these are whole numbers on the number line that you grew up thinking about, and now we fill them in with a bunch of points in between, right?"
"Once they get to know her, and when people are able to identify with an individual and look her in the eye and see that she is living, feeling being who has a will to live, then people care."
I have been working here with Animal Care and Control for almost nine years.
This morning was really astonishing to me.
"All of a sudden it dawned on me, this sweet, innocent cow running away from being slaughtered."
"And I never been thought about it before, that something is actually being slaughtered, and it is my ground beef, and it is my steak, and stuff like that."
"And we have been eating this for years,"
I never pictured that face on that.
And it hurt.
I can't do that anymore.
I can't.
"So, now, we are all work on not eating meat."
Me and my entire family.
Because I am realizing that this is a life we saved today.
And with my family we will be saving a couple of more.
Thank you.
She is about a year old absolutely beautiful Hereford.
And those unfortunately are cows that are used for meat.
"She was most likely at a live market and because they have a very strong will to live,"
"like any living creature, she got loose."
"She had a will to live, and she did it."
Hello!
"When she is going now, she is gonna have cows of her own breed even."
She is gonna be so happy.
"When the trailer arrives, the cows in the herd will moo."
Yeah.
They will moo in a big line.
Everybody lines up.
They will start mooing to her to comfort her and to tell her that they are there.
And she will moo back.
"Any animal, any creature has a strong will to live."
"She is an ambassador for all animals, who are still suffering in slaughterhouses and on farms, and who don't don't have such a lucky outcome."
People love a happy ending and it's happy.
"People go on hunts every day, and usually no one gets killed."
"But today, one man gets charged by an elephant."
And everybody can see that he got killed by an elephant.
Why did he happened to be in the path of the elephant?
Why did the elephant go in a different way?
Why did he hunt a slightly different way?
Why didn't the elephant here him and run away?
The man would not have been in the path of that elephant if not for witchcraft.
"To put it another way, the Zande have no concept of bad luck."
"When something bad happens, when misfortune comes along, it's due to witchcraft."
"Someone, a witch, made it happen."
Why did my crops fail when everyone else's thrived?
Why did the tornado zig in set aside so it hit my house and not my neighbor's house?
Why did the mosquito bite me and not use so I got malaria but you didn't?
To these-- the answer to these questions for the Zande is witchcraft.
In Zande Land anyone could be a witch.
Children and the very old are usually not accused of witchcraft because it's rare for them to seriously offend people.
But almost any adult you meet could have witchcraft inside him or her.
So you better be nice to everyone.
Witchcraft is never random.
It's personal.
The person who causes you harm knows you and probably lives near you.
He or she is someone you've offended.
"So when something bad happens you ask yourself, who have I offended?"
Have I insulted someone?
Have I cheated someone?
Have I slept with someone's spouse?
Did I break a promise?
Those are all the kinds of things that could make someone's witchcraft heat up.
"The Zande know-- okay, now the part for the medical students in particular about how-- what witchcraft has to do with the treatment of illness."
The Zande know that people get sick.
And they usually get better.
"If you have ever put your head on a washing machine, that's how it felt."
That's how I heard the airplane.
It's a dream come true for me.
I wanted to be instrument rated for a long time and now I can fly blind and deaf!
(laughter)
I'm up in the clouds and it is freedom.
That's what it is.
It's all about freedom.

"With his high energy, warm hearted style; Stephen Hopson, a gifted story teller, unpacks the steps to overcoming adversity, which he calls the ""HEAR PRlNClPLE."""
Have a passion.
Entertain the possibilities.
Act on your intuition.
Remember the people who helped you.
Stephen:
"Without passion, you can't go anywhere."
You are stuck where you are.
"But with passion, you will be amazed at how doors of opportunity will open up for you."
Announcer:
"Along the way to becoming a pilot, Stephen's passion opened up another door of opportunity, which led him to become a successful broker on Wall Street with Merril Lynch."
But there were obstacles along that path as well.
Stephen:
"In order to overcome adversity, you need to be able to trust your instincts."
I saw an advertisement in the paper for stock brokers and I thought what a good career change that might be.
So I called up the guy for the interview.
I had an interview with the vice-president.
"I walked into his office, I was really nervous."
I was intimidated.
The office reeked of wealth.
I met with him for twenty minutes.
"He said, ""OK, you are meeting with twelve people on my floor."""
"""Each and every one of them said you're not going to make it."
We used to wait.
Sometimes it never came.
We
used to wait.
Sometimes it never came.
We used to wait.
Still moving through the pain.
We used to wait.
We used to wait.

"Ladies and gentlemen, please give a warm welcome to Dr. Eric Schmidt."
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:

I'm over here.
I'm over here.
Thank you very much. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; GÖKE:
"Mr. Schmidt, we're honored. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
Thank you.
Thank you.
"Thank you all, and thank you very much for having me back to this, such a gorgeous city and congratulations to this show for 50 plus years of great achievements."
"In the years that this show has been going on, there's been a lot of discussion about new ages, new eras, new ideas and I am absolutely convinced that we're about to see a new age, an age of augmented humanity."
"A time when computers will work for us, and they'll make it possible for us to do the things that we really want to do, which are mostly around people and happiness and making the world a better place."
"And when I think about the compute--the consumer electronics industry in particular, what you all have built over the years, we have an opportunity now to entertain, to inform, to educate with technology that we've never been able to do before."
And that's what I want to talk about in this show.
"Today, when you look at a consumer electronics product, think about it as a music player."
"If it's not connected to the internet, it just has what's stored on it."
It can't get the music that's nearby.
It can't get the latest music.
It has to be on the net.
The same is true of everything.
That change is very subtle.
But not the animal sliding into number 2: the lungfish.
It can breathe air.
"So when the going gets tough, the lungfish digs deep."
"Three feet underground, it swallows mud to excavate a chamber."
It secretes slime that hardens into an impermeable body bag...
sealing the lungfish away from the drought.
Mud makes a time capsule.
And great bricks.
"Inside its cocoon, the lungfish shuts down."
The comatose lungfish is number 2 because it can remain in suspended animation for up to four years!
"But even in Southern Africa, the rains will come."
[thunder]
[rainfall]
Water dissolves the slime sack.
The lungfish awakes.
Withered and shrunken.
It has survived for four years by cannibalizing its own muscles.
But it has still enough strength to slither to water.
It's an extraordinary feat of endurance.
Only one animal survives longer in far worse conditions.
NARRATOR:
The ultimate survivor hides out in the forests of Canada.
"For the world's largest deer, it makes life a living hell."
Moose are bled dry.
Attacked by a plague of tiny vampires.
It's late summer.
Bloodsuckers the size of a grain of sand swarm at the optimum height to meet a moose.
Ticks.
CO2 from moose breath stimulates the swarm.
"One moose can be home to 100,000 ticks."
Over two months the ticks drink 10 gallons-- that's a moose's total volume of blood.
Infested animals are called ghosts.
They sat by my mum's hospital bed  when my mum was in coma.
They came and get me out of jail when I get busted for stupid stuff over the weekend.
Nobody ever did that for me before.
"Nobody cared about me."""
"So, that thing that Thay says  'goes in in order to go out'."
"It comes in from the staff of caring  teachers, people like yourself first, unrelentingly, fiercely,constantly pouring that love and attention and going beyond their expectations to care about them."
To care about them.
"Here is a poem,"
"(Bell) by Travis Daniels, a Youth Build student."
"He was at a conference and saw all people like you caring and talking about the program,  and how they want to help it."
"""His Hero, from being lonely and getting blunted to seeing concern and feeling wanted."
"From hating you because you stared, to loving you because you cared."
"In the pain, I am in a struggle, I need to talk, I need to hug you."
I hope that you feel my heart and its words.
"Now, picture the youth that stand on the curbs."
"They have no hope, they see no change."
They try to live but stuck in their ways.
"16 years old and suicidal,  you may not relate but trust me, I do."
"I reminisce about my cries for help,  no one noticed that I hit myself."
"As time went on, a lost soul grew and was welcomed by those who care for the youth."
I know there is more that  you want me to be.
"I am still in the dark  but the light, I can see."
"Let it be known, I love what you do,  from now till forever, I'll pray for you."""
"So, everything that everyone has said  is part of the picture, right?"
"Taking care of ourselves,  appreciating each other, knowing that we can't do it all in one step."
"Taking the step, step-by-step."
Pouring out the love.
"Mother Teresa, I want to quote her."
"She says,""Love until it hurts  and then love some more."""
"I think that's what we're called to do and the more that we take care of ourselves, the more of our natural love we have available to share with our students."
Thank you very much.

The oldest woman ever to give birth gave birth this year.
She was sixty-three.
"You could imagine at sixty three, the baby didn't have to force its way out."
It spent the last three months bungy jumping.
"Everytime she went for a s*, it had to brace itself."
Like the end of the Italian Job.
"Apparently, scientists have come up with a condom for premature ejaculation."
"Basically, it's got an anaesthetic in the lining."
It makes you numb so you can lost for longer.
Or you can wear it inside out and you don't have to wake anybody up.
"Thanks, because that one can go either way."
combination words?
"So in linear combination words,"
do the linear combinations of the columns fill three dimensional space?
Every b means all the bs in three dimensional space.
Do you see that I'm just asking the same question in different words?
Solving A x -- A x -- that's very important.
"A times x -- when I multiply a matrix by a vector,"
I get a combination of the columns.
I'll write that down in a moment.
"But in my column picture, that's really what I'm doing."
I'm taking linear combinations of these three columns and I'm trying
to find b.
"And, actually, the answer for this matrix"
will be yes.
"For this matrix A -- for these columns, the answer is yes."
This matrix -- that I chose for an example is a good matrix.
A non-singular matrix.
An invertible matrix.
Those will be the matrices that we like best.
There could be other --
"and we will see other matrices where the answer becomes,"
"no -- oh, actually, you can see when it would become no."
What could go wrong?
How could it go wrong that out of these --
out of three columns and all their combinations --
when would I not be able to produce some b off here?
When could it go wrong?
Do you see that the combinations --
let me say when it goes wrong.
If these three columns all lie in
"the same plane, then their combinations will lie in"
that same plane.
And it is possible.
You just have to splint with something else.
You splint with bamboo and gauze.
And you need several people to pull.
The most important aspect was politeness.
You explained what you were going to do and what they could expect.
Compassion was more important than the medical performance.
My medical training said the opposite.
"You could behave badly, but you had to follow the latest research."
In Africa you did the best you could.
But you could never compromise on how you treated people.
In rough deliveries you could save the mother by fetal skull decompression.
"If the fetus was dead, you had to put a hole in its head to get it out."
It could save the mother's life when it was too late to do a caesarean.
But first you had to explain to the grandmother that the baby was stuck.
"""I can get it out, but the head will be destroyed."""
"- ""No matter."
"Will she live?"""
"- ""Maybe."
"I can't promise anything."""
"You reasoned with the disciplinary board, or else things went bad."
These are the konzo patients.
It's from 21 August 1981.
That's a date that is etched into Hans Rosling's memory.
That day the request for help came on the back of a cinema ticket from a village in the country.
The Italian nun worked as a sort of district nurse.
She wrote that she had 30 crippled women and children with both legs paralyzed.
She'd been nursing for 20 years and never seen anything like it.
The first woman I examined had extremely sharp reflexes.
That means it's a spastic paralysis.
"Sort of like MS, but the symptoms developed in one day."
I saw immediately that I had never seen anything like this before.
"Zombies are at an all-time low level, but the fear of zombies could be incredibly high."
"It doesn't mean we have to have government policies to deal with the fear of zombies,"
"It's ridiculous, for Christ's sake."
The NHS...
"There was a survey in the NHS about dentistry, where they found that some people were removing their own teeth!"
You know...
"And they brought on some senior dentists onto Sky News, and gave out to him, and said"
"""This is terrible, People are removing their own teeth!"" And this guy stood there and went"
"""Well, obviously systems should be put in place to deal with it."""
Which is stupid!
"He should be going ""Well, these people are clearly morons of the highest line"""
[Laughter]
"""Who removes their own teeth, for Christ's sake?"
"I'm a dentist, I don't remove my own teeth, y'know what I mean?"""
But there's kind of a notion that everyones opinion is equally valid.
My arse!
Bloke who's a professor of dentistry for 40 years does not have a debate with some idiot who removes his teeth with string and a door.
Alright?
It's nonsense.
And it happens all the time with medical stuff on the television.
"They'll have a doctor on and they'll talk to the doctor, and they're all ""doctor this, and doctor that"" and"
"""what happened there"" and ""doctor, isn't it awful?"" Right?"
"And then the doctor will be talking about something, with all the benefits of research and medical evidence."
"And they'll turn away from the doctor, in the name of ""ballance"", and turn to some quak, witch doctor, homeopath horse shit peddler on the other side of the studio."

I love this game so much!
God damn it.
"Oh, boy."
"Oh, no."
(Finebros) You are going to play this game.
What?
"It's much richer and much more demanding, particularly when you get to fourth grade."
That's when it starts.
I'm not surprised in Sarah Lee's case that things began to unravel at third and fourth grade.
"If Sarah Lee is a bright child, she was probably able to fake her way through first and second grade."
You can fake your way through if you listen to your friends talk about the story they've read and then you use those answers when the teacher asks you the questions.
But around third or fourth grade is when you begin to deal with expressive language problems.
"In other words, the"
language is there.
I don't know it.
But it's almost locked away.
The language is inside the brain.
They have an inner language.
They know what they want to say.
And they just can't express it.
They can't get the words out.
We're going to make a paragraph that matches the picture.
"Like, sometimes when I'm in a class and my teacher, she asks us, like, what's the answer?"
And I'll raise my hand and I'll know the answer.
"But then when I say it, it won't come out the way I was thinking of it."
What about the way Homer used the gun in that episode?
What do you think that they were trying to say?
Sarah Lee.
He used it in-- he used instead-- he used the gun to-- he used the gun to shoot place instead of shooting people.
"When you think about it, you're thinking in your head, I didn't want to say that."
Did he use it for what it was really intended for?
"Sometimes it's a little embarrassing because people, they'll laugh and mumble under their breath, that's the wrong answer."
That's embarrassing.
Sara Lee masters the language of TV shows and commercials and the playground.
But she locks up when confronted by the more fully dimensional language encountered in books and in the classroom.
Experts say she has expressive
language deficiency.
She understands well but she has trouble explaining what she knows.
How efficient has the planet become at capturing photons?
"Does it capture 50%, 10%, 1%, 1/10^(th) of a percent?"
A guess?
How many for 50% Hands up.
How many for 10%?
Hands up.
A couple.
How many for 1%?
Hands up.
How many for 1/10^(th) of a percent?
Hands up.
See the grad students think it's a 1/10^(th) of a percent.
It's a small amount.
"I don't know the precise number, but it's down between 1/10 and 1% I think."
"So even after 3.5 billion years of evolutionary history, the planet has not become terribly efficient at capturing sunlight."
Freeman Dyson has got this definition of different kinds of civilizations.
One of the stages of civilization would be when you can put a sphere around an entire solar system and capture all of the photons coming off of the sun and harness it for running a civilization.
That would capture the entire solar output.
"Well, you know, we are a tiny little dot on the face of the sun, and we're taking 1/10^(th) to 1% of its photons."
So this isn't a very big number when you look at the solar output.
"What happens is that basically algae, primarily algae, but also trees and all other larger plants, are capturing this."
Then the herbivores are eating the plants.
The primary carnivores are eating the herbivores.
The secondary carnivores are eating the primary carnivores.
"What do you think is in the red arrows, going off to the detritivores?"

That's the red arrow.
It's pretty big.
Any idea what Africa would look like if you got rid of the dung beetles?
You would need hip-waders; especially in the Serengeti or any of the big national parks.
"One looking at a half a million, a million, and two million seeds per acre drilled, and broadcasting, where we just toss it out on the ground."
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
Win Phippen:
"Another big question is simply determining when in the fall we need to plant, so I have successive planting dates, starting at September 1, all the way up here to November 30."
And looking at what is the best time to plant.
Can we do it right after corn?
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
So the pennycress is crop that you're using to put into the field in the alternate season.
"So you're still going to have corn or beans, and then this goes in afterwards?"
Win Phippen:
Yes.
"Typically, on pennycress, we would follow corn."
So you would plant after the corn comes out.
"And this would form a rosette, just a bundle of leaves, into the fall, it will overwinter just fine."
And it will start flowering in early spring.
And it will be at this stage by the end of May.
And you would hope to harvest that by the first week of June.
And then you'll plant a full season of soybean right behind it.
And so the real niche for this crop is growing off-season crop production.
"It's called ""double cropping."""
Beth Seaton:
And this is what the Field Day is going to be about tomorrow; people are going to come out so they can
learn more about pennycress and what you're doing out here?
Win Phippen:
Absolutely.
We're trying to answer all the basic questions you would ask on any sort of new crop you're introducing.
"Because this is strictly for the bio-diesel market, we're not making a feed crop or anything like that."
It's strictly for off-season bio-diesel production.
So we've got a lot of studies out here.
"What we'll look at, in terms of, what kind of nitrogen does it need?"
"""Nice and quiet around here."""
"If there was more land, then he bought some more pigs, a few chickens and some cows."

You know what!
All that grubbing around outside takes far too long.
We're going to fatten you up and fast.
It's not a fairytale storybook.
You're there to be eaten.
"""Errrrr ... not sure that's such a compliment, really."""
"We'll squeeze you altogether nice and efficiently, and you'll all get sick right away."
"""You're telling me ..."""
"Listen Piggy, I'm not interested in your personal vision right now."
"In the Netherlands alone, you lot produce 70 billion kilos of dung, do you know how bad that is for the environment and the climate?"
"""Uh ..."
"I'm sorry for living."""
"Did you know that cows of all farm animals are the largest producers of greenhouse gasses, mostly through all that belching and farting?"
Do you know what the problem is?
You're eating us out of house and home!
"""Who was here so pleased about fattening us up?"""
"But all that food has to come from somewhere, doesn't it?"
So ... we destroy the rainforests and plant soya crops instead.
But the rainforests are really important for the absorption of carbon dioxide.
Then we spray the stuff with pesticides and we ship the soya off the Europe where it ends up in your feeding-troughs.
So well-organised.
What are you people up to?
"""Oh-oh, well that's not our fault."
"Who actually wants to eat meat anyway?"""
"The consumer, OK, is there something wrong with that?"
Well.
"That's a good question, who actually eats so much meat?"
Eating meat is a luxury that we've got all rather too used to.
Don't dare touch our steaks!
"6 divided by 287 and that gives me 0.021, carrying one extra significant figure."
"And if I now take that probability and I plug this into here, I've already done a calculation."
I got a table here.
I find that that diameter to the correct number of significant figures is 0.7.
And the actual diameter of these balls is 0.8.
So you guys did a very great job.
[APPLAUSE]
All right.
This works.
That's how they calculated the diameter of the nucleus.
That's it.
Nothing else involved in this.
That is the principle behind how it was done.
Very simple.
That is the principle behind how the quark was discovered and the size of the quark was revealed.
That is terrific.
"Now, we've got the problem that the scientific community had in 1911, 1912, right after the discovery of the nucleus."
"And the problem is, now we know the atom has got a nucleus, we know it has got an electron, what is the structure of the atom?"
How does the electron and the nucleus hang together?
"In particular, what we have to do is we have to ask what is the force of attraction that keeps the nucleus and the electron together?"
"We are going to talk, here, about this classical description of the atom."
And we've got to talk about the force of the interaction first.
"Well, there are four known fundamental forces."
What is the force that is the weakest force?
Gravity.
Absolutely.
What is the force that is the next stronger force?
Electromagnetic.
Absolutely.
What is the next stronger force?
Weak force.
And the next force?

"You get all your calcium , all your iron, your omega-3, all your protein and amino acids."
"Everything from this, everything."
"Now I know I am a skinny white dude with glasses telling you to get enough protein, but these guys aren't skinny."
Only one of them is white.
"So as you can see these guys, their diet consists of no meat, no dairy, no eggs, no fish."
There might be some variations.
"Tony Gonzalez, he might be eating fish."
Don't hold me to it.
"But I know Prince Fielder, who is the 2009 home run derby king, no meat, no dairy, no eggs, no fish."
"Mac Danzig, who fights in the ultimate fighter, he is a season 1 champion, UFC fighter, no meat, no dairy, no eggs, no fish."
So you can still excel at your sports.
You can still gain muscle mass on a plant based diet.
"Again, just remember the gorilla."
So what do they eat?
"Instead of dairy everything a meat eater, a dairy eater an egg eater eats,"
"I eat as well, that just comes in plant form."
"No cruelty involved, no cholesterol, high in fiber."
And these are all the processed food.
This is the transition food.
This is where you go when you go from eating meat and you make that switch.
Instead of poultry.
Instead of beef.
"Garden burger, veggie burger."
"Right here what you see up here, this is one of the best items on the market."
"Again, not the healthiest food in the world, but certainly better than your meat."
This is called the Riblets.
The slugs are then trimmed to exactly match the width of the engravings.
The forms of engravings and slugs are then set as pages.
The page form is filled with bits of leading.
Here's my setup for making engravings.
A jig for engraving small blocks.
Some slugs needed underlay for the I's and L's to print properly.
"This is the final packing layer for a run, showing the make ready."
I spent an additional year writing the pancreas section.
"""Here we are at Quercus Press, on 6/6/06."
"Printing the last, well the first of the last of the runs of the Pictorial Webster's."""
I used the labels from the book to create a marbleized text pattern.
"First the yellow run is printed, then the reds, and finally the green and blue."
"""Is this really the last one?"
"Here it is."""
"""Last one!"""
"""And this is the speed I printed the book, basically; that real slow speed."""
"""Alright that's it."
"Hooray!"""
Next began the binding process.
"For hundreds of years, binders have cut and folded sections this way."
"The Pictorial Webster's had over 5,000 sections to fold."
The sections have holes punched for sewing.
"Using a sewing frame, the books are sewn on double flexible rolled linen tapes with supported kettles."
"Because the sewing is so time consuming, I invited 11 bookbinders to Strong Arm Bindery in Maine where we managed to sew 50 books in a weekend."
"After a book is sewn the spines are pasted up, the edges are trimmed,"
the book is rounded and backed.
The edges are prepared for decoration and edge decoration is applied using rubber stamps.
The endbands are sewn.
The spine is lined with airplane linen and paper and a hollow is formed on the book.
Boards are attached.
"The leather is pared,"
"it gets wetted out, then pasted up."
We need to start the education of children now about it.
To prevent the seeds of  bullying from ever being planted.
I realize that this is no easy task.
"But the more effort we make, the  greater our impact will be."
We can do it!
"The next time you see someone put down or picked on, don't remain silent."
Speak up.
Take action.
Help them.
"If we come together, we  can put an end to bullying."
That is my dream.
[applause]
Thank you all so very much.
Have a wonderful evening.
"I'm an ecologist, mostly a coral reef ecologist."
I started out in Chesapeake Bay and went diving in the winter and became a tropical ecologist overnight.
And it was really a lot of fun for about 10 years.
"I mean, somebody pays you to go around and travel and look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet."
And that was what I did.
"And I ended up in Jamaica, in the West Indies, where the coral reefs were really among the most extraordinary, structurally, that I ever saw in my life."
"And this picture here, it's really interesting, it shows two things:"
"First of all, it's in black and white because the water was so clear and you could see so far, and film was so slow in the 1960s and early 70s, you took pictures in black and white."
"The other thing it shows you is that, although there's this beautiful forest of coral, there are no fish in that picture."
"Those reefs at Discovery Bay, Jamaica were the most studied coral reefs in the world for 20 years."
We were the best and the brightest.
"People came to study our reefs from Australia, which is sort of funny because now we go to theirs."
"And the view of scientists about how coral reefs work, how they ought to be, was based on these reefs without any fish."
"Then, in 1980, there was a hurricane, Hurricane Allen."
I put half the lab up in my house.
The wind blew very strong.
The waves were 25 to 50 feet high.
"And the reefs disappeared, and new islands formed, and we thought, ""Well, we're real smart."
Is it Ole Bull that you rank highest within Norwegian music?
"Yes, Norwegian classical music."
Why?
Because he was a great man.
And he was  allowed to be that because it was deserved.
Because he lead Norway onto the world map.
He  was the first man to promote Norwegian folk music.
He was able to get national scene in Bergen which was the first cultural place we had.
"He started Ibsen, Bjornson - a national hero."
But you want to play in the movie about Ole Bull?
"Yes, I would have loved to do that."
"I'm probably a bit too dark and talk a bit too much eastern-Norwegian, but, yes, if I practiced enough."
Can you give an example of Ole Bull?
"That's ...um ""Norway in a nutshell"", ""Seterjentens sondag"""
"You can almost see the cow walking across the grass, sort of."
What does music mean to you?
It's nothing more and nothing less than a mood setting.
Sometimes you really want just to be happy when you're sad or you just really want to feel something.
You really want to fall in love with your wife again and there it's probably not the best choice to listen to Eminem right then.
If you really want it music has the ability to bring the feelings you want to have.
Does it do this for you?
"Yes, absolutely."
The one thing I'm still to understand is people who go to see their favorite artist on a festival and there are those who just go to festivals to listen to some artists.
And then I can't understand what you get out of it when you go to those concerts and not caring for those artists.
"But of course, there is a relation - it's great."
"And me, I love festivals but every time I'm asked to join a festival as audience"
I always make sure to see who's playing.
"""Oh, I'm only able to go on Friday"" ""OK, who's playing on Friday?"" ""I don't know""."
You have to find out what you're going to listen to.
You have always had a discipline; you have practiced a lot ever since you were a little boy.
Do you still have that discipline?
The thing is that as a classical kid it went straight  to my blood that you had to practice 2 hours a day.
"I'll send him another bucket of Yemeni almonds, he loves Yemeni almonds."
"If you look at all these guys, they're just ordinary people who have good days, bad days, successes, failures, setbacks, everything."
Where they differed is in the fear department.
That's where they differed.
They did not allow the possibility of failure to stop them from trying again and again and again.
We have seen J.K.Rowling.
Twelve times.
That's the key.
"That's the key, right there."
"See, as long as you're still trying, as long as you are still in the game, the game hasn't ended."
You are still working on it.
You haven't failed.
"You fail when you throw in the towel, when you give up."
"And then, you are the one who has announced that failure."
Nobody else has done it.
"You are the one who announced failure, yourself."
"In the mid 1970s, when I was in my 20s,"
"- it's kind of difficult to believe I was ever in my 20s - but, yeah that did happen sometimes in the last century."
I was in Abu Dhabi trying to build my life.
"I had to sleep in the beach, not because I love beaches, but because I was thrown out of my home by the landlord."
"We were 8 guys of us staying in one room, one day, the landlord came  and threw us out."
He found another tenant who paid him more.
So what do I do?
"Well, you do what you have to do."
I went to sleep in the beach.
"In fact, my morning shower was in the mosque nearby, which helped me discover gold, and that's a different story."
It took many years to happen.
"At that time, I was about 21, 22 looking at myself."
I was looking at a failure.
"I mean, how do you actually build your life when you have no roof in an expensive city like Abudhabi at the age of 20-22?"
"Many years later, it occurred to me that what I was looking at is not failure."
"I was looking at the building blocks of character that will make you one day appreciate, strive and if ever you succeed, realize that you succeeded."
"I'll still come into the chatroom, that sort of thing, but it's it man."
I don't want to be a venue for man-children and My Little Pony.
"Nobody's learned shit, nobody's done shit."
"So, you know how it is."
"No, I'm not gonna abandon the chatroom man."
"I'm gonna still come in here, but I'm not gonna stay in here for as much time as I had."
Sometimes I've stayed in here for shit.
"I mean, it seems like an hour, but five hours have gone by and shit man, I've been having a lot of great conversation with a lot of you guys and females in this chatroom and transsexuals, mind you."
"Amy Daly is a believe it or not has been a great breath of fresh air, you know, in the chatroom."
Especially when I came in here this morning feeling a little jaded about this shit.
"I'm still jaded about it, but great words from her, great words from a lot of people in here, so anyway, once again, man, the show's over."
"I'll be in here, man."
You know?
"I'll be in here, but... that's it for the show, man."
"The archives will be there if people still want to listen them, they can still listen to them, so... anyway. coyoteinthehat:"
"Seriously, thank you for the time and money and everything you've put into it and sorry for adding to the forces of trolls and stuff earlier this year and whatnot, but man, thanks for everything."
GuitarNinja:
"Yeah, man, the past couple of years."
"You've been sewing the seeds of capitalism and now it's just time to sit back, you know, chill, wait for the harvest, man."
"You know, it's coming, it's gonna happen."
We just gotta wait and do our homework.
Sebastian:
"Thanks for the show, Ghost. karaszkunskadoo:"
"Hey, I wonder what will happen to the Engineer since you are quitting this show. iusethelancer1:"
"The Engineer wasn't real, dude, okay?"
GhettoCapitalist:
"Look guys, the Engineer."
Y'all don't worry about the Engineer.
The Engineer is eligible for so many entitlement programs now it's ridiculous.
He's gonna be making more money being unemployed than he ever would at Ghost's show.
"I'm just sayin', I'm just-- you know."
"Section 8, all that stuff, all that stuff."
I've seen Nathan's self confidence grow in the last four or five months.
And so
I feel like even the mistakes that we've made have somehow turned toward building his character.
And he's learned a lot.
I'd say just don't worry about what other people think.
"And if you feel bad about yourself, just try to make yourself feel important and do something."
And be proud of it no matter what.
But Nathan's parents know better than to invest too much hope just yet.
They know that kids like Nathan often have good starts in new environments.
Later this spring they'll know more about whether they have finally found an answer for their boy.
Now back to Adam Dunning's story.
He's out of the psychiatric ward.
But now Adam's parents have come to this courthouse.
Their son is on trial for breaking and entering.
He's been given a court appointed lawyer.
"His parents are told that if he's found guilty, their boy will be in the custody of the state until he's an adult."
The prosecution makes its case.
I saw a glimpse of his face and I saw the outline of his face.
"And I said, oh, that's Adam."
Shouldn't he be in school and--
It doesn't take the jury long to render it's verdict.
We find the defendant guilty.
"As they say goodbye to their son, Jane Dunning comes to grips with a harsh new reality."
Adam's birthday is four days from today.
And I didn't expect to have to ask somebody else permission to bring a birthday cake.
"Four days later, it's Adam's 16th birthday, celebrated in jail."
"But as terrible as it is to visit him here, Adam's parents are in for a surprise."
When the sunset looks for the moon--
Their son is finally in an educational environment that seems to suit him.
"The classes are small and because so many of these kids have learning problems, the teachers here have found a way to get through to them."
Mercury has a rock cross made of the same kind of rock found on earth.
Beneath the crust it is thicker mantle layer of the same material.
"You have to work so hard to form the letters, that it's hard to do that and spell at the same time."
And it's hard to do that and have good ideas at the same time.
You're so good spatially--
Dr. Levine tells Nathan his strengths can help overcome his weaknesses.
"For example, his ability to draw this complicated design from memory can help him visualize facts like history dates that otherwise he would forget."
Remembering dates is a lot of detail.
But it won't be a lot of detail for you if you make a diagram of it and remember it as a visual pattern.
I have evidence that you're very smart.
You need to convince yourself of that.
"It was probably the first time he's heard somebody-- since the second grade teacher-- tell them how great he was, instead of ADD, you know, this huge thing."
It was really specific and it was something that seems manageable.
So it's very encouraging.
"But Nathan's parents think he needs one other thing, discipline."
"One year later, the ranks of the Hargrave Military Academy include Nathan Suggs."
"We get a lot of boys that are very smart and intelligent, have a lot of potential."
But for whatever reason they come here because they do not think they can do it.
Cadet Suggs.
"For his parents, sending their son here is a big sacrifice."
But they believe it's his big chance.
"For this year, we cleaned out his college fund and my parents also contributed."
"And so, I don't know exactly what we would do for next year."
I love you.
I love you.
I've missed you so much.
He lives at Hargrave.
And this fall has been very difficult for me.
"But I'm hoping that he will take in some of the discipline, make it his own."
I'm feeling happier.
I have more self discipline.
I'll probably have more than I have now at the end of the year.
And it will probably be a whole lot easier.
You look so nice.
"The problem is your body, all of us; we care about what happens today, not down the road."
"One of the take home points that astonished me when I start to think about it, is that nature, evolution selects out for who has good kids, and that's what evolution is about: it's about having children; about progeny."
It's not about what happens when we're 80yrs-old or 90yrs-old.
"And so, inflammation is fantastic at dealing with today's ramifications."
"The problem is if you get the flu today, your risk of cancer and heart disease a decade or a two decades from now are up."
S:
If I get the flu just once?
Dr:
If you get the flu once.
"So those five, six days where you feel horrible, your inflammation is through the roof."
That's having ramifications down the road.
S:
"This is already getting a little scary for me, because I've had the flu...so I already feel a little worried about my cancer risk."
Dr:
I can tell by looking at you!
S:
"The symptoms we get when we have the flu or cold, it's not the virus that's causing it."
"The virus is causing the inflammation, which is causing the symptoms."
Dr:
Yes.
That's what's wild.
"When you get a virus, your immune system attacks it, and then you get a fever."
I still don't know why we get fevers.
"It's one of those things where cytokines, which are proteins the immune cells make to send out and get more reinforcements and tell the body what to do, it causes a fever."
"Is a fever good, is a fever bad?"
I don't know!
"We take Tylenol to lower a fever, but is that a good thing?"
Nobody has really looked at the long-term ramifications.
"We've looked at the short-term, but how does that effects will there be a decade from now?"
We just don't know.
S:
"What you're saying is the reason we have inflammation is, something is happening to my body,"
"Standard adult size is going to be a 22 gauge, 1 to 1 and a 1/2 inch length, 22-23 gauge for intramuscular."
It's going to be a smaller gauge and a shorter length for small children.
You might have a 3/8 inch for an infant perhaps instead of 1/2 inch.
"I have a very small set of 1 inch or 1 and a 1/2, its going to be very short; 1/2 inch, 3/8, something like that."
Ok so select the appropriate size needle and syringe.
[ Pause ]
I'm going to clean the top of my medication bottle.
"I've done my 5 rights, I've done my 3 label checks to make sure I have the right medication."
[ Pause ]
I'm going to put the amount of air that I need to pull back the same amount of volume of medication to displace my volume and my... [ Pause ]
...ampule; my vial.
Get rid of the bubbles.
[ Pause ]
Drop your medication.
"Again, this is sterile."
I'm going to need to carefully recap it.
Alright so now I go into my patient's room and I position my patient in the appropriate spot so that I can administer the injection.
"For this particular medication, I want to use the ventrogluteal muscle."
Remember that's the most recommended in the literature to use for your injections.
So our anatomical landmarks with the heel of your hand.
I'm using my opposite hand to the patient's hip so this is their right hip and my left hand.
"I find the head of the femur and then with my index finger,"
I find the anterior superior spine.
I move my middle finger along the crest to open it.
Open my hand.
Alright.
This is the pelvis here and this is bone.
"This is a little tight as I walk my finger down, I can see that it has a lot of give there and this would be the sweet spot of the muscle; the give of the muscle."
I'm going to use my new alcohol.
Make a nice big circular cleaning out.
Ok.
Now I have to keep my hand on the anatomical landmarks because it's a very small injection site so I can't take my hand away.
"So 2,600 words and it has 23 paragraphs."
A two-paragraph preface is then added to the report.
Is the average number of words per paragraph for all 25 paragraphs less than 120?
So this is interesting.
So the average number of words per paragraph for all 25 paragraphs less than 120.
So if we knew the total number of words in the document we'd be set.
We would just take the total words divided by the total paragraphs they have now.
"They have the 23 original plus the 2 from the preface, you have 25 total paragraphs."
Now it told you the average words per paragrah.
"Now, we don't know the total words, because the total is going to be equal to the 2,600 words in the body of the document plus the words from the preface-- I'll call that words sub preface-- all of that divided by 25."
This is the average.
"This is what we really have to figure out, to figure out if it's less than 120."
That's what they want to know.
So statement number 1.
Each paragraph of the preface has more than 100 words.
"So I guess we could say that the preface, the words from the preface are greater than 200."
"That's another way of saying that the total is going to be greater than 2,800."
"Now if the total is greater than 2,800, what does that tell us about the total divided by-- excuse me."
"So then the total divided by 25 is going to be greater than 2,800 divided by 25."
"What's 2,800 divided by 25?"
"Let's see, 25 goes into 2,800."
"1, 25, 30, 1, 1 times 25, 25, 50, 12."
So it tells us that the average is going to be greater than 112.
So that doesn't help us.
"If it told us that the average was going to be greater than 120, we would be done."
"We would say oh, we have enough information to answer the question."
"Actually, the answer is no, that the average is going to be greater than 120."
"But here, this tells us the average is greater than 112."
It could be 113 or it could be 121.
So it doesn't answer our question of whether the average is less than 120.
So statement one alone is not that useful.
Statement number 2 tells us each paragraph of the preface has fewer than 150 words.
[laughter].
A bit of a scam because I wasn't afraid.
Maybe it was because at University I was part of the Psychic Research Society and one of the things we found out was that never ever once in a hundred years of ghost hunting in UK has a ghost ever harmed anybody.
So armed with that information I had my research - so why be afraid?
They can't harm me at all.
And that way I wasn't conditioned through fear.
"But the Thai people, and there's a few"
"Thai people here, [laughter], they have grown up with ghost movies."
"Ever since they were small they saw these ghosts, huge, like heads with entrails following behind, and they would do terrible things to people."
"And because of that, just even the mention of a ghost.."
I remember this story - this poor little novice staying in our monastery in Thailand.
"Because it was a cremation monastery that day was the moon day when we would meditate all night...that poor little novice, we did a funeral that day, and were supposed to meditate all night... in the hall."
"Now usually, little novices, they are only about 11-12 years of age, there is no way they would stay up all night, they would sneak off in the middle of their night back to their house."
"We knew they did this, it was breaking the rules, but they were only small little monks, so we didn't mind."
And we've go to be kind..
Not this day.
"This night, that little novice, he would not leave the hall."
[Laughter].
Because he was just so afraid of the ghost.
See even the [Laughter].
Those dogs must have been reborn in Thailand.
Last night.
[Laughter].
Great special effects.
"Now these, here they go again."
[Laughter].
"Shut up, dogs!"
[Laughter].
"There, they're going now."
"Now these ghosts, or rather this little novice, the poor little novice, stuck in that hall, you know 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, too scared to go out."
When it got to about 2 o'clock in the morning he just couldn't hold his urine any longer.
He had to go to the toilet.
- Yes.
- Especially because Java catches jar index offsets.
- If you replace a jar in a running app....
"- Things get very, very interesting. - ..you get horrible, horrible problems."
"- If you try to load a component that hasn't been loaded yet, the jar offset is wrong so it will just give you a bizarre ""no class.found"" error."
It's a bad error.
It's bad.
That is all.
"- Because I noticed it the other day and because I think it's great, when you look at 5.4, they now ship examples in a format where you build ANT and you get legacy, JAR, and WAR versions fully embedded of all the examples from Web Objects"
"If you don't know how these work or you don't know how to build them, they ship with 5.4 examples now."
"Thanks, Pierre and whoever else made that happen."
- It was actually Daryl.
- OK.
Thanks Daryl.
- Thanks Daryl.
- Is that a hand in the air?
- He may have been the shadow we run to the door.
- I just have a quick question for Pierre.
"When you compile those jars into the extension directory, [indecipherable] and you still have to put them back in the [indecipherable], correct?"
- No.
- If you just shovel them in there then you're lost when the application starts?
- Any jars in your slash content extension are going to be loaded before anything else in your class paths.
There is nothing you have to do.
It's even loaded before the library extension.
"If you want to override a JAR, you just put it there."
It's going to be loaded before anything else.
- OK.
"I just want to go through one quick final topic here, and we're running low on time."
Don't repeat yourself really.
I've only got so many jokes.
I have to use the lame ones.
"One of the things that bothered me when I first started using WOlips is I had all these build files for each project, and they were all substantially the same."
"I have D, I have a D 70 too, earlier with the, the."
"Yeah, the, but this new one's nice, very nice, the, the busier ones now, although I really help with the multimedia stuff."
"Um, I'm gonna look and see if we have something coming up on that."
Um.
"While I'm looking up the D800, what types of courses would be most helpful for you coming up?"
"Um, do you, do you I ike the longer courses where you can just go in and pick out a movie?"
Or would you like shorter more direct project type courses?
"Um, I would say well, for the subject matter, I mean I think you guys do a pretty good job, at least I think with a lot of thee a Adobe ones, which I, which thee, I think those are my, the ones I've been using a lot, on there."
"Uh, how they connect with each other, that would be helpful because they go into the multi media, there is after effects photo shop, and premiere, and the audio piece, what is it, the um, audition."
Uh huh.
"Here I have one that shows how they all connect with each other, how you place to using one thing and go back to the other set, for saying, mention "" em briefly in one or the other."
And stuff.
Don't really have anything to actually.
"So the true relationship, because all these have, are connected that you can use them in a way where they all complement each other, but"
"I don't really, it offends me to figure them out."
"Within each one, they might mention, it might mention a little piece on after effects."
Sure.
Bye.
But not like the total workflow.
My might mention a piece on premier.
"But there's no real slow connection on how all of this production piece, that production piece works all together."
"Same with the way of uh, design is really easy to figure out on that one."
It's just opening photoshop illustrator.
That's not that complicated.
But far as the .
"Uh-huh , a lot more complex on there."
Okay.
Okay.
"Um, yeah that's good feedback."
Those areas are mostly outside of my segment.
"But it's really good information for me to, to talk to the audio and video guys about."
And uh.
And you still do this?
And I don't do this anymore.
I haven't practiced for real for the last 7 months.
What the meaning of that?
For me if you were to pull it very far - it was like being a drug addict and not getting the high you need.
"But after some time I learned - no, I do practice because I go through everything in my head."
"I play with the band, I play concerts, I don't have time to do everything anymore."
But that time will hopefully come again.
As long as you work and do something you just need to be happy with yourself.
Teenagers who are sad and have a bad personal image send in a demo after demo and have no response from  record-labels.
They shouldn'tbe sad they should be proud of themselves that they  are not just sitting on the couch doing nothing.
Do you feel that you had to let go of many things to get where you are now?
No.
The only thing I let go without knowing was my first and biggest love.
"You talk a lot about love, you sing about love."
"Well, there are a lot of emotions in me; it's not for just anything."
"I get very emotional - ""Titanic' you know of it, right?"
"Or ""Notebook"","
I just cry because I put myself too far into the films.
And I can't be sad for breaking up with a girl when there obviously was fate surrounding the situation.
We're getting close to the end and we talked about it earlier - how does you future look?
If you can picture it?
If I'm allowed to decide...
But you will decide.
"Yes, my future looks like I will now do many concerts this summer which I will not let people cancel, that was some surprise."
And...
And I will after some time take a little vacation where I will think over what my next project will be.
I'm quite sure that one day I will end up in children's television as a host probably.
And I also really want to help with a new talent.
And I will turn into an old-news and then I want to be there discovering a new talent.
"It's kind of the ""circle of life""."
"Alexander Rybak, thank you for being here."
Now what if I tell you that we observe that X 1 was equal to this little value X 1.
"Well if that's the case, then you can come up here and you'll see that X 2 is more"
likely than not to be in this region as.
I'll circle them right here.
So in fact you would expect the conventional mean x one equals little x one to be maybe somewhere around here .
And this would be near 2.1 okay?
Likewise you can see just from this.
"Again, that the variance of x2 would have shrunk."
"Because knowing something about x1 would give us information about x2, and that would decrease our uncertainty about the"
location of x2.
And in fact this expression here tells us how to actually do that.
This mathematically.
"So, so they're conditional distributions."
"A conditional distribution of a multivariate normal is again, multivariate normal."
"We also mention that the linear combination, ax plus a, of multivariate normal random variable x, is normally distributed with mean, a times the expected value of x plus little a, and covariance mix, matrix a times covariance of x times A transpose."
Welcome back.
Well we left off on problem number 13.
But let me start it over just so that we don't get confused kind of doing the problem over the course of two videos.
So number 13.
It starts off with this pattern.
"3, 5, minus 5."
And what it says in the problem is that each even number term is 2 more than the previous term.
And then each odd number term is negative 1 times the previous term.
So we started with 3.
"So let me say term-- let me write it here, term-- term and then value."
And then what we did.
Maybe we could call that f of x or the function.
How did we go from one value to the next?
"So if we make a table, term one is value 3."
And that's just the starting one.
Term two is 5.
"That's because we added 2, we added 2 to 3."
"While universities are trying to devise courses in conflict resolution, and governments are trying to stop skirmishes at borders, we are surrounded by violence, whether it's road rage, or whether it's domestic violence, whether it's a teacher beating up a student and killing her because she hasn't done her homework, it's everywhere."
"So, why are we not doing something to actually attend that problem on a day to day basis?"
"What are we doing to try and make children and young people realize that violence is something that we indulge in, that we can stop, and that there are other ways of actually taking violence, taking anger, taking frustrations into different things that do not harm other people."
"Well, here is one such way."
(Video) (Laughs) You are peaceful people.
Your parents were peaceful people.
Your grandparents were peaceful people.
So much peace in one place?
How could it be otherwise?
(Music)
"But, what if ..."
Yes.
What if ...
One little gene in you has been trying to get through?
"From your beginnings in Africa, through each generation, may be passed on to you, in your creation."
"It's a secret urge, hiding deep in you."
"And if it's in you, then it's in me too."
"Oh, dear."
"It's what made you smack your baby brother, stamp on a cockroach, scratch your mother."
"It's the feeling that wells up from deep inside, when your husband comes home drunk and you wanna tan his hide."
"Want to kill that cyclist on the way to work, and string up your cousin 'cause she's such a jerk."
"Oh, dear."
"And as for outsiders, white, black or brown, tar and feather them, and whip them out of town."
It's that little gene.
It's small and it's mean.
"Too small for detection, it's your built-in protection."
"Adrenaline, kill."
It'll give you the will.
"Yes, you'd better face it 'cause you can't displace it."
You're V-I-O-L-E-N-T.
"Cause you're either a victim, or on top, like me."
"Goodbye, Abraham Lincoln."
"The expert's strategy, a full immersion language treatment."
"She needs a lot of practice talking in complete sentences, talking on a more"
"literate level of things, really talking about issues."
What was Clinton's position in the article that you took your notes on?
"We want to build these muscles, these expressive language muscles because one of the best ways to learn to talk, right, is to have plenty of practice."
It's almost like working out for a sport.
And she has to do that.
She needs a verbal work out.
You need to be a risk taker.
You need to try a new word.
You need to make that
leap.
But you have to be comfortable.
You have to be confident.
You have to know you're in a safe place to do it.
And someone's got to be there to help give you the ammunition to take that risk.
"But once you start taking it and once you start succeeding, the ripple effect is wonderful."
"There, it's very positive."
"So the prescription for Sarah Lee is a kind of immersion therapy, almost like"
learning a foreign language.
"There will be flash card drills, practice conversations, lots of reading, and new vocabulary words over and over and over."
"If she keeps it up, the experts believe she can overcome her expressive language deficiency."
What should you do if you find someone's wallet or purse in a store?
You should-- if the person it not too far-- you should run and give it to them or you can--
"One year later, the assessment of Sarah Lee's progress is indeed hopeful. --and let them know that you have their wallet."
I hope if I loose my wallet you're the one who finds it.
This past year has been a year of real growth for her.
She's contributing more to classes now and she's doing more reading.
And she's found ways to help herself.
And that alone is like shooting baskets to prepare for a basketball game.
"The more she does, the better she gets at it."
Sara Lee has improved dramatically.
Those are roosts.
Oh!
OK.
"Again, what it does is, it makes the whole farm infrastructure portable."
"So it could be done in suburbia, it could be done on a rental farm, it could be done on an uncle's farm, you can move all this around."
"And that really changes the entrance opportunity, and the expansion capability, by having the infrastructure all portable."
"Of course, the turkeys, they'll pick up 45% of their diet off the grass, so that's why they get a much bigger area."
It's great.
"Yeah, they got this area today, and they were just there two days before, we move them every two days."
"And, again, we've got the cows ahead, we're shortening the grass with the cows."
Do you need a tractor to move this?
"Yeah, this is a feed buggy up on the front, so it's hooked up to the feed buggy."
"So you just hook up to the feed buggy with a tractor here, you set up your next circle up here, and you just hook up with the tractor and open it up."
And you've been doing this for twenty years?
"I came back to the farm full time September 24, 1982."
It'll be 30 years this September 24th.
"So what type of adoption have you seen across the industry with people accepting these techniques and utilizing them, and raising pastured poultry."
"Well, it's growing, but it's such a tiny subset of the whole industry that it's still not a spit in the ocean."
Still way less than one percent.
"Oh, yeah, but it's growing."
What is the rate at which it is growing?
Is it doubling every year?
Is it 50%?
"I don't, it's hard to tell."
Do you think it might be doubling?
"I don't know, I doubt if it's doubling."
"Doubling every year, that would be astronomical."
But I can imagine now that it's increasing by 10 or 15% every year.
So it's definitely going up.
"So if there were one thousand farms last year, there'll be probably eleven hundred this year, and thirteen hundred next year, and it's definitely on the up swing."
Being fueled partly by the whole local food tsunami.
"The whole local food, integrity food tsunami."
"large molecule, it's going to move very slowly."
"If it's a very small molecule, it will move through fairly quickly."
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
Win Phippen:
"When it gets to the very end of that tube, there is a flame there, and it's going to burn off this molecule."
"And depending on the intensity of the fire, that is created because the molecule comes out at that time, creates a signal."
"And that allows us to determine not only how much oil was in the plant, but also the specific components that actually make up that oil."
Let's take a look at the computer here.
"And so this is the controller, and this controls where all the viles are."
And it keeps track of all the numbers.
I know where all my samples are.
"I know how much material is in those samples, and when it is going to be run."
"And after the sample is run, I get what is called a chromatogram."
"And, simply, it's a graph."
This is the signal strength over time.
"And so, I inject my sample here, and as it goes through, every time"
"I get a peak, that tells me that a compound that is coming to the end of that glass tube."
And so this tells me all the different compounds that were actually in my seed oil.
"Now, as a plant breeder, how do we make sense of this?"
All right.
"What I know is, I know what compound this is at the two-minute time period, four-minute, or six-minute time period."
"Well, let's say I'm trying to create a bio-diesel product that doesn't create as much smoke."
Or maybe doesn't gel up under very cold conditions.
Beth Seaton:
Right.
Win Phippen:
So what I would look for is plants that have very high of this compound and perhaps something low in this compound.
Beth Seaton:
I see.
Win Phippen:
And so I can alter the relationship of these different constituents within the oil.
And that jumping to the front in the end are just a matter of updating that cursor position from zero to the size and whatnot.
The operation where things get a little more bogged down is on this insert where I need to insert a position.
"If I insert the X, Y, Z into the middle there and you can see it kind of chopping those characters down, making that space to insert those things in the middle."
"Similarly, doing delete operations, if I jump to the beginning I start doing deletes here."
"It has to copy all those characters over and deduct that length, right, so that the vectors do that work for us on remove that."
"That means that if the vector's very large, which is not a typical in a word processor situation, you could have you PhD theses which has hundreds of pages, if you go back to the beginning and you start deleting characters you'd hate to think it was just taking this massive shuffle time to get the work done."
So
let's see my - I'm going to bring in the display that
"- whoops,"
I don't like something here.
[Inaudible].
"Now, what do we have?"
"Oh, look at this."
"Well, well, we will continue on."
This inside - okay.
Hello.
[Inaudible].
I have no idea.
I'm not going to try to [inaudible].
Okay.
It's inside.
That's got me totally upset.
Okay.
We still have our old code somewhere.
Okay.
Why do I still have the wrong - what is - okay.
"Oh, well."
Today's not my lucky day.
I'm not going to worry about that too much.
I'm just going to show [inaudible].
Okay.
"So seeing what's actually happening, right, it's like just mostly kind of moving that stuff back and forth, and then having the vector do the big work, right, of inserting and deleting those characters, and doing all the copying to get the thing done."
A pile of elephant dung is about this big.
Okay?
So that's what's going off in here.
We are deeply indebted to dung beetles. &amp;gt;
Believe me.
And to fungi.
What's going off here is respiration.
So that's energy.
"You know, you all use it up every day."
"You're using up somewhere between oh 3500 and 5000 calories a day, depending on whether you're on a sports team or not."
And so that's what's going off out here.
And this is coming off of every level here.
Okay?
So you can think of this as what's left over and this is the flow of all that ATP driven stuff on the planet surface.
Now how does that look in space?
"Well if you look at tons of carbon fixed per hectare per year, where green is a lot and yellow is a little, you can see that the forests are really important."
Okay?
"And the closer you get to the equator and the wetter it gets, the more efficient the forests are at fixing carbon."
This is for the terrestrial part of the world.
"If you could put the reefs in, they would be fixing carbon, and they would be withdrawing it on kind of a different timescale."
"Because the tropical forests, although they fix a lot of carbon, don't actually cleanse the atmosphere of CO2, at least not at equilibrium."
Why not?
Student:
As they're &amp;gt; they're actually they're also respiring.
Prof:
"They are respiring, yes."
What happens to a tree when it dies?
Student:
It releases a lot of carbon.
Prof:
"It releases a lot of carbon, right?"
So in fact you could grow up a big forest but you only get the carbon benefit the first time you grow it up; after that it goes into an equilibrium where the trees are falling down and the logs are rotting and they're releasing carbon back into the atmosphere.
That can be nice but then you only have what's on that island.
By opening up the borders for others you become more innovative and you get more unexpected creative solutions.
"As a result, you become better at what you do."
We made the Muse app firstly because we enjoyed it and also because there wasn't an app like it.
"Besides being a fun app, it also gives a better perspective on art history."
"Old paintings from for instance the 17th century consist of many details, which can overwhelm spectators."
We're not used too looking at images in that way anymore.
"By focussing on the small parts and making your own image, you create a better view of the overall picture."
After we won the competition we contacted Open Culture Data... ...to see if we can use the basis we made for other museums as well.
These other musea have their own needs and different data.
"Also, we made MuseApp from our own perspective... ...but by using the data and wishes of other organisations we can perhaps use it in other ways."
We've learned a lot by organizing our own app competition.
Getting a result of 27 entries like we did takes a lot of work and energy.
"You need to let developers know what you're doing, but you also need to know what they want."
Sustainability is also an important issue for app competitions.
"We've given out these four prizes, but what happens to an app when the competition is over?"
I heard everything.
"If you don't mind, can I accompany you to the airport?"
"Yes, aunty."
"Come, aunty."
"Aunty, I'm going."
I'll destroy everyone.
Bless me that I return and eat your cooking.
"Go, my son."
Return victorious.
Why are you crying?
Say it with a smile.
Keep smiling until I return.
This is the All India Radio.
The recent reports inform us that... ... the Indian Air Force has shot down three of the enemy bombers.
And they have destroyed one enemy camp.
This is Prakash.
- I would say definitely and the most important is to throw.
"Beyond that your personal religious beliefs on throwing checked or not or changing or not, are less important, but not swallowing it the really important thing."
"- OK, at least we can agree on that much."
The rest of it is just a quite good practice.
Use formatters.
A lot of people seem to be afraid of these.
I ended up using them all the time.
They're easy to write.
"If you look at the whole API for, was is Java text format, there's a whole lot of stuff there."
"But, with Web Objects, you usually don't care."
"You're formatting one value of an input, and you're...you're parsing one value of an input or you're formatting it into a string."
"You don't need to get too carried with writing fancy, fancy formatters."
It's good because it keeps the views separate from the model and the controller.
"Rather than using a formatter, you can often just do it in a WO component."
The thing is that this is a little bit smaller than a WO component.
It's easier to reuse across a bunch of WO components.
It promotes reuse because of that.
The code's not tied to one specific page.
Yes?
- This is going to get ugly
A lot of the formatters aren't thread‑safe.
I think all the ones I rate are thread‑safe.
"But, I know some of the Java timestamp formatters, and some of the other ones aren't thread safe."
"The best practice is probably to cache them in a session if you're not going to get multiple requests, unless of course, you're using a long response page in which case then you've got a different problem."
"The best practice is, it depends but think about thread safety."
- Yes.
None of the Java formats are as thread‑safe.
- Sorry.
It's actually not that costly to pick a formatter.
Just don't try to share a formatter between threads.
You're asking for trouble.
"There's no doubt, I put the date and time into the session as seen from the slides to hold the time zone in them?"
You'll have one per week and a final.
You'll have deadlines for these
like in a real class.
And you must do these.
Apart from getting a certificate you'll learn.
Finally.
I want you to know how I've structured the class.
I think this is true of most courses or classes.
Its highly recommended to mimic the real world or face to face classes on some dimensions.
"So one of the dimensions is, I will release material one week at a time."
You will not be able to get into the ten week class and do the whole class in a week.
Why am I doing that?
For two reasons.
"One, I genuinely believe that you need time to understand new stuff and practice assignments."
Problems within the videos.
"And if you understand the stuff, you are better off, you can go to the next step."
Luckily Finance builds on stuff.
"So you have to know the first week to know the second week, and so on."
"Well, the second reason is probably more important of releasing one stuff, one week at a time."
"So synchronous, I mean not at a point in time, but for a week."
The second reason is that learning happens from each other.
"So when I do these classes live, all assignments are on a group, and they evaluate each other, not everybody gets the same grade."
"So, this I can't mimic online, but you can."
Join the forums and
learn from each other.
"In fact, I believe you learn far more that way than you'll"
learn from my videos.
And I actually hope that's the case.
Now content and materials is important.
The main material you will get from me is the video.
"For every week there would be approximately two week, two hours worth of video broken up into pieces."
Because Finance is so applied you'll have many opportunities to pause the videos whether I ask you to pause or not.
- Yeah.
"On the very rare occasions when you expect it and it won't hurt and you're dealing with it some other way, then, yeah, just comment it."
But don't leave an empty block like that.
"The problem is, though, if you don't have that in there then you have to say,"
"""OK, this method throws parse exception."""
Then all the methods that call that have to throw parse exception.
You end up making changes all over your code.
It's a real irritation of Java checked exceptions.
"The best practice for this, instead of swallowing the exception, convert it to unchecked and re throw it."
- Or throw it.
Or throw the original.
"- Yeah, but if it's checked then you have to declare it all the time."
- Yes.
- As opposed to... nobody likes to do that.
Nobody is going to do that.
Nobody is going to make that many changes in their code.
This forward exception has a little bit of a private API call that you can use there if you want to stick with that.
"Pierre is shaking his head going no, and I agree with Pierre because I don't do that."
- I hate that feature of Web Object.
"It's forward exception is something that... objective C polluting Java, it's..."
"- I get this from Wonder, and I blame Wonder for making me do that."
I did it the nice way and Anyo got cranky at me.
There's actually a class called Exception Converter.
"In the notes to the slide there's a URL for it, and it's a much nicer thing to do."
"- Well, you run that exception?"
"- Yes, but the problem of throwing in a run time exception is you lose the original stack trace."
"- You chain it, you chain it."
- Not if you put parentheses E.
- Yes.
Actually parentheses E plus exclusion as to what in this level why it's being thrown.
"- Chain, chain, chain always chain."
- No.
And there's a real reason why professionally produced narrative is so successful.
"You know, just watch the Oscars and get a sense of how important it is to society."
"My view is that--you asked the question, if"
I may answer it at the wrong order.
"The right way to answer the question is, What does the future look like?"
"And then, How does everybody's models adapt to that? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
"Well, we know what the future looks like. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
"Well, let's say it, because I think people are often, are a little confused about it."
The fact of the matter is that mobile devices are going to be the majority of the way that people get information.
And the argument is relatively simple.
You already have them.
They're called your phones.
"And over the next five or 10 years, these phones, if you just-- a simple Moore's Law calculation--will have the capacity to do much of the entertainment and communication and so forth that you use in other media."
And you're seeing that today.
So you have a business model issue.
But there's not a question of how people are going to spend their time.
So let's go through what these devices look
like.
"They've got a GPS on them, so they know where you are."
"They're personal, so they know what you've seen and they don't show you the same thing over and over again, like my television."
You know?
The same show over and over again?
Show it just once.
"It's highly, highly personal."
It can do excerpts.
"And, of course, it's also summary form."
So the combination of all of that means a huge change in the business model.
And I don't think we know exactly how that'll monetize.
What we do know is those products are getting built.
And so the challenge and the opportunity is to figure out how to make money in that.
"But, you won't get there by suing your end users."
You won't get there by preventing this technology from happening.
"Now we've sampled, we've interleaved this, we've decided how to sample."
"Now the big thing we got to do is simply construct our matrix a, and then solve a large under-determined system, and by the way"
last time in class.
"We solved the large under number of systems in four ways, okay?"
"And we found out by the way that zero inverse looked like, a lot like the"
"l2 optimization, so really we're going to solve it in three ways today."
"Alright, so"
let's come back to our code.
And we first do this.
"Alright, the first thing I'm going to do, is going to take the discrete cosine transform, of the indentity matrix."
"I'm going to map out for every point that's On in the signal, suppose I have a point."
"I figure out, if I have, if I have this signal of 5000 points and I have one point on, I find okay, what would that correspond to?What, how would I discreet cosign transform that point?"
What if the next point were on?
How would I discreet cosign transform that?
"So in some sense, I build up my basis, my way of transforming, so, so essentially right?"
"What's going to happen here, is i'm building up this."
"So I this big matrix that gets me from the signal space to the Fourier space, okay?"
"Okay, and so if I have, if I think about sampling, if I sample with one, zero, zero, zero, zeroes, zero one, zero, I can start thinking about how, what's the connection between these two?"
Okay.
"Yeah, exactly, 5,000 delta functions, as it were."
And seeing what the response is.
"And then what I would do with this, is say, okay great, I've done that."
"And now what I'm going to do, is I'm going to take the 500 that matter."
"In ot her words, I have said, let's sample at 500 different points."
"Well, how would those 500 different points, essentially generate cosined [UNKNOWN]"
DCT components.
There it is.
And that's my matrix a.
This is equivalent to my times psi [UNKNOWN].
This one will take a little meditation time.
Meditate upon it.
Maybe burn some incense.
Okay.
So you've talked a little bit about the benefit to the students.
Tell me a little bit about the actual scientific research program that you're doing with this grant.
Win Phippen:
Okay.
"As you know, here in illinois, we produce a lot of corn and soybeans during the summer months."
"But the rest of the year, the fields set empty."
"And so, some researchers over at the USDA over in Peoria have come across this crop that allows us to plant in the late fall, after corn comes out."
And it actually grows throughout the winter months.
"It gives us field coverage, so we don't get a lot of erosion in the fields during the winter months."
Beth Seaton:
"So it's good for the field, too?"
Win Phippen:
It's excellent.
So not only is off-season production but it also gives benefits back to the field for growing corn and soybeans.
Beth Seaton:
So when do you harvest this pennycress?
Win Phippen:
"We plant it in late fall, and then, sometime, in late May, typically, by the first of June, is when you would harvest this plant."
"And that allows you to then plant your soybeans right behind it, and there is no impact, then, on the soybeans."
So they can get a full season of soybeans.
"But what they are benefitting is, they have produced all that pennycress."
And why pennycress is being looked at...
"As you can see, it's a fairly oil-seed crop."
It has a lot of oil.
It's about 40 percent oil.
And so the intent of this is simply to help displace a lot of petroleum-based products.
"And that could be fuel, so this simply could be crushed, to get out the oil, to make a bio-diesel product."
"Or you can take this seed and add it to, let's say, plastics, and other, sort of, petroleum-based products. it's not going to alleviate us completely from the dependency on foreign oil, but it is certainly a step in the right direction."
Beth Seaton:
It sounds like an exciting research program for Western.
Win Phippen:
"This one was actually around the playing cards I got yesterday, but it had a certain familiarity to it."
"And I said, ""Well, what exactly is the process?"""
"And they said, ""The band is applied to the tail, tightly."
"And then another band is applied to the scrotum, tightly."
Blood flow is slowly retarded; a week later the parts in question fall off.
"""Great -- got it."""
"OK, I call the SPCA to confirm this -- they confirm it."
"I also call PETA, just for fun, and they don't like it -- but they confirm it."
"OK, that's basically how you do it."
So the next day I go out.
"And I'm given a horse and we go get the lambs and we take them to a pen that we built, and we go about the business of animal husbandry."
Melanie is the wife of Albert.
Albert is the shepherd in question.
"Melanie picks up the lamb -- two hands -- one hand on both legs on the right, likewise on the left."
"Lamb goes on the post, she opens it up."
Alright.
Great.
"Albert goes in, I follow Albert, the crew is around."
I always watch the process done the first time before I try it.
"Being an apprentice, you know, you do that."
"Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out, you know, this black rubber band but what comes out instead is a knife."
"And I'm like that's not rubber at all, you know."
"And he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun that was just coming over the Rockies, it was very -- it was, it was impressive."
"In the space of about two seconds, Albert had the knife between the cartilage of the tail, right next to the butt of the lamb, and very quickly the tail was gone and in the bucket that I was holding."
"A second later, with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger, he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp."
"And he pulled it toward him, like so, and he took the knife and he put it on the tip."
"Now you think you know what's coming, Michael -- you don't, OK?"
"He snips it, throws the tip over his shoulder, and then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward, and then his head dips down, obscuring my view, but what I hear is a slurping sound, and a noise that sounds like Velcro being yanked off a sticky wall and I am not even kidding."
Can we roll the video?
No I'm kidding -- we don't -- (Laughter)
I thought it best to talk in pictures.
"So, I do something now I've never ever done on a ""Dirty Jobs"" shoot, ever."
Why is there more matter than antimatter in the universe?
What are the dark matter and the dark energy that make up so much stuff in the universe?
Where did the universe itself come from?
What we're hoping is that the Higgs boson gives us a new tool to answer these questions.
"That is, one era ends, another one begins."
"It is as if we'd been in one room for all of our lives, doing physics, and the Higgs is a door into the next room."
And it'll be very interesting to see what's inside.
"Of course, I believe."
"Especially during the period of recession, my faith has grown even more."
Human actions can only be successful with the help of God .
Let's see.
We have this graph over here with t is the independent variable on the horizontal axis and d is the dependent variable on the vertical axis.
And then they have a table here.
Looks like this table corresponds to this graph.
"When t equals 1, d is 40, when t is equal to 2, d is 80."
So these points correspond to points on this line.
"And then they explain to us, you are buying a gym membership."
The membership costs $40 per month.
"In the graph and table above, d is the total number of dollars that you pay for your gym membership, so that's d right over there, and t is the time in months that you keep the membership."
"Write an equation for the amount of money d that you pay for your gym membership, if you keep the membership for t months."
And you see that here.
"If you're one month, you pay $40, two months you pay another $40, you pay $80."
You see that in the graph right over here.
"If you have 0 months, you pay nothing."
"Then one month, $40, the next month another $40 getting you to $80."
"So if I were to write this as an equation, the dependent variable here is the amount that I pay in dollars."
So that is going to depend on the time.
And how is it going to depend on the time in months?
Well I'm going to pay $40 per month times the number of months.
"So I can either write it as 40 with a little asterisk sign, which is Shift 8-- and then I put t there-- or I could literally put just a t right over there."
"And I think that's right, because if my time is 0 according to this table and according to this graph,"
"But that's the same thing as s squared over s squared, plus a squared over s squared."
"So it's s squared plus a squared, over s squared, y is equal to minus e to the minus st, times this whole thing, sine of at, minus 1 over s squared, cosine of at."
"And now, this right here, since we're doing everything with respect to dt, this is just a constant, right?"
So we can say a constant times the antiderivative is equal to this.
This is as good a time as any to evaluate the boundaries.
Right?
"If this had a t here, I would have to somehow get them back on the other side."
"Because the t's are involved in evaluating the boundaries, since we're doing our definite integral or improper integral."
So let's evaluate the boundaries now.
"And we could've kept them along with us the whole time, right?"
And just factored out this term right here.
But anyway.
So let's evaluate this from 0 to infinity.
And this should simplify things.
"So the right-hand side of this equation, when I evaluate it at infinity, what is e to the minus infinity?"
"Well, that is 0."
We've established that multiple times.
"And now it approaches 0 from the negative side, but it's still going to be 0, or it approaches 0."
What's sine of infinity?
"Well, sine just keeps oscillating, between negative 1 and plus 1, and so does cosine."
Right?
So this is bounded.
So this thing is going to overpower these.
"And if you're curious, you can graph it."
This kind of forms an envelope around these oscillations.
"So the limit, as this approaches infinity, is going to be equal to 0."
"And that makes sense, right?"
These are bounded between 0 and negative 1.
And this approaches 0 very quickly.
So it's 0 times something bounded between 1 and negative 1.
"Another way to view it is the largest value this could equal is 1 times whatever coefficient's on it, and then this is going to 0."
So it's like 0 times 1.
"It turns out that what we want for, what we'll call the common denominator, it turns out to be the least common multiple of two and three."
Well what's the least common multiple of two and three?
Well that's the smallest number that's a multiple of both two and three.
Well the smallest number that's a multiple of both two and three is six.
So let's convert both of these fractions to something over six.
So one half is equal to what over six.
You should know this from the equivalent fractions module.
"Well if I eat one half of a pizza with six pieces, I would have eaten three pieces, right?"
That make sense.
"One is one half of two, three is one half of six."
"Similarly, if I eat one third of a pizza with six pieces, it's the same thing as two over six."
So one half plus one third is the same thing as three over six plus two over six.
Notice I didn't do anything crazy.
All I did is I re-write both of these fractions with different denominators.
"I essentially changed the number of pieces in the pie, if that helps at all."
Now that we're at this point then the problem becomes very easy.
"We just add the numerators, three plus two is five, and we keep the denominators the same."
Three over six plus two over six equals five over six.
And subtraction is the same thing.
"One half minus one third, well that's the same thing as three over six minus two over six."
Well that equals one over six.
Let's do a bunch more problems and hopefully you'll start to get it.
"And always remember you can re-watch the presentation, or you can pause it and try to do the problems yourself, because I think sometimes I talk fast."
Let me throw you a curve ball.
What's one tenth minus one?
"Well, one doesn't even look like a fraction."
But you can write it as a fraction.
Well that's the same thing as one tenth minus-- how could we write one so it has the denominator of ten?
Right.
"It's the same thing as ten over ten, right? ten over ten is one."
"So one tenth minus ten over ten is the same thing as one minus ten-- remember, we only subtract the numerators, and we keep the denominator ten, and that equals negative nine over ten. one tenth minus one is equal to negative nine over ten."
Let's do another one.
"Because, if they were down at the South Atlantic, it'd take a while for somebody to get to them."
And so we'd throw that out 150 ft above the deck and you try to wrap it around
"like, here's the capsule, and the wind is -"
"They'd put two small ones, the capsule, and then the other two."
"And they're tied together, so they'd wrap right around."
"And then then you'd drop your paramedics, and those guys were good."
They were experts in nine fields.
"They're paramedics, mechanics, parachute guys, anything."
Great bunch.
So we did this for a while and really got it down.
They'd mark spots like you do in the side window and they guided you in.
"I'd be on hot mike in the back, and they'd be looking out seeing the thing."
"The capsule, and the logger?"
Yep.
They'd see the capsule and the logger because they'd nod their head one way and you'd go one degree
"left, two degrees right."
"And then they'd jump, just like that."
And it didn't make any difference what the wind was doing.
"One night, them seas had to have been ten feet high and blowing the top right off them."
Middle of the night.
"And we went up to 20,000 feet so a couple million candle [?] out the back end."
Flares.
And then we'd go back down.
But then the astronauts show up and so we flew to Houston twice for a weekend two different times out in Houston.
And we went out there because they had different equipment.
And they also wanted to see who was going to pick them up.
If they got in trouble...
"So they get on the plane, and it's funny because all I had was a stack of wood pallets with a piece of plywood on it and the flight [?] around a couple power cords so they could have - they call it [?] - search and"
"locator ... anyway, they were just improving on this to find the capsule."
"That was back in the early 60s, you know, sort of primitive."
"So, they're on the plane, and I never gave it a thought."
"You meet them, and you're working with them and they go out and fly with us and they'd see what I was doing in the cabin and they were offering advice on what it was like and the scuba guys and the whole bunch, we all worked together."
And zero ends three.
[sound].
"And now the problem is, we've changed which path is the shortest one."
"We added ten to the top path and only five to the bottom path and as a result, they've reversed."
So now the bottom path ST is actually the shorter one.
"So if you run Dijkstra on this graph, it's going to come with the path ST even though that's not in fact the shortest path in the original network, the one that we actually care about."
"Okay, so that's why you can't just naively reduce shortest path with negative edge lengths to shortest paths with non-negative edge"
lengths.
"Moreover on this very same, super simple thre e node graph, You know, we can try to run, running dikes for shortest path algorithm."
It's perfectly well defined.
It will produce some output.
But it's actually going to be wrong.
"It is not going to compute shortest path distances, correctly in this graph."
So let me show you why.
Unless of course initialization will work as it always does.
So it's gonna start by saying the shortest path distance from S to itself is zero via the empty path.
"And then, what's it going to do next?"
"It's going to say well we need to enlarge the set capital X by one vertex and there are two crossing edges, it's the"
XV edge and the ST edge.
And what's it going to do.
It's going to use the
Dijkstra Greedy score.
"So the score of this upper edge is going to be one, and the score of this bottom edge."
Is going to be negative two.
"'Cause remember, you take the previously computed shortest path [inaudible] of the tail, that's zero in both cases."
And then you add the edge lengths.
"So the edge lengths are one and minus two, so the scores are one and minus two."
Which of these is smaller?
"Well evidently, the ST arc has the smaller score minus two."
So what is Dijkstra's algorithm gonna do?
"It's going to say yes, let's go for this edge ST."
Let's bring T into the set capital X. T is now part of the conquered territory.
"After all, the poison that doesn't kill you makes you stronger."
I have a friend.
He had another friend.
They become business associates together.
And they decided to expand their business into European expansion.
My friend was responsible for it.
"While my friend was busy with the European expansion, he was hit by the news that his friend has committed a massive financial fraud, and ran away."
"And, we are talking massive, we are talking mega dollars, because the business was dealing with those kinds of sums."
"My friend was investigated, suspected, but anyway, at the end of the story, although the investigations proved that my friend was innocent, and in fact, he was a victim, it destroyed his life in the country where he lived, and he had to leave."
"In the other country, where he went maybe about 2-3 months later,  he was hit by another crisis that hit him in a very personal way."
Something that only his wife and I know.
"Nobody else knows, not even his family."
"You'd say, by that time, he should be finished."
He's done.
Two major crisis in your life almost instantly.
But he managed to stand up again.
He managed to rise again.
"Right now, he is facing another crisis, another major disappointment."
"But I look at his face, and I see a defined man."
I see a man who refuses to give up.
I see a man who's still trying to build up his life.
He reminds me of a story.
And this is where I want to end this.
My time is almost done.
"Of a man who enters into a fight, one of those ancient fights, there were no rings at the time, they used to fight in the open."
And he gets beaten up in his face and he falls flat on the ground.
He rises up again and is hit again.
"Every time he rises up, he is hit again, third, fourth time, he's down on the ground. trying to rise up, he thinks in his head,"
"""If I'm able to stand up again, it's because I refuse to stay down."
"And if I do stand up, and I'm hit again and I'm never able to rise up at least it will happen while I was fighting."
"At least it will happen while I was on my feet."""
"The Chinese have a saying, and I want to say this to myself to you guys, and to Yemen."
But the growth arc is not going to be in power level.
It's going to be in something else.
So that's just one way to look at characters.
It's not the only way.
But it is one way to view your characters.
"Almost every good character... they may move along this but almost every good character is going to start of with a little smidge of this, and a little smidge that."
"And so, I will add under the ""aspire to be,"" which is kind of the same concept, but: they are an expert at something."
In other words they have a superpower.
And their superpower might not be something we normally think of.
A great example of this is going to be Sam from Lord of the Rings.
"He is superhumanly loyal, would you not say?"
He has one attribute.
Everything else about him is basically goofy and befuddled.
The midget in the world of giants.
And yet he has this one super quality that all of us would love to have.
And because of that he consistently polls as people's favorite character from Lord of the Rings.
"In fact there is a lot of discussion that he probably is the hero of the whole story, is Sam."
And that is because Sam has this blend down really well.
"Yes, he's kind of a fool in a lot of ways, but he has this one thing that is defining about him."
"And it's something that, when you look, you say ""yeah, I wish I could be Sam, for that moment."""
"So, an expert at something."
The other one I'll add up here is that they are proactive.
Have we talked about proactivity?
Did I do anything about this?
"I think I talked about it in the first week, or maybe the second."
Keep in mind that you don't need to do all of these.
And there are a few more I'll throw up here.
These are all tools in your toolbox that you can use to increase the level of sympathetic... the sympathetic nature of a given character.
If you can combine them all - great.
"In fact, pretty much everything up here are things that you should try to put in almost every character."
"But it doesn't mean you can't have one that leaves out one of them or two of them, or something like this."
These are the ways that we make people sympathetic.
"Andfor real man, this is it."
You know.
"I've talked about how I faked rage when it came out to these stupid memes that I wanted to be popular and that sort of thing, man."
Don't get it wrong.
"The rage as it pertained to the political and the social components and the capitalist components, they were genuine."
They were 100% genuine.
"As a matter of fact,"
"I was a pretty livid guy back in the conservative days, man and believe it or not, I had health problems during that time."
"I had a lot of health problems that that .... that were inspired or transpired because of me thinking about all these subject, you know."
"And believe it or not,"
"I found that utilizing this show as a way to exert all that angst that I had was comfortable and if somebody listened, that's fine."
"If they didn't, you know, it's good."
"I mean, it didn't really-- I didn't really do it for the money."
"I mean, if I did it for the money,"
I would be -- I would've put out books and shit.
"I would've done that shit, but... anyway..."
"It is necessary, are you kidding me?"
It is necessary.
"No, the show's not gonna be back this fall."
"No, no, no."
"Fuck no, I am not going to fucking continue to fucking have a venue for these idiots to, you know, I don't know, to do whatever it is that gets them off or whatever whatever it is that sustains the continuity of these sons of bitches as it relates to their goddamn trollin'."
"Well, I'm just not gonna do it anymore."
"I'm done here, man."
"I see we got a whole bunch of people here so I'll stay in here for a few more minutes, but it's over man."
"I mean, like I said, I'll come into this room and not to mention, the people that I have talked to about making actual businesses with, I am not joking, you know what I mean?"
I'm not joking about that whatsoever.
"I am sincere when I say that you know, I want to make businesses."
"I want us to make money, you know."
And ...
I'm sincere when I say that man.
But I got a lot on my plate on top of all this stupid online ridiculous bullshit.
"You know, a lot of people depend on me for a lot of shit and I know it seems that"
What happens when we have different denominators?
"Well, hopefully it won't be too difficult."
Let's say I have one fourth plus one half.
Let's go back to that original pie example.
Let me draw that pie.
"So this first one fourth right here, let's just color it in, that's this one fourth of the pie."
And now I'm going to eat another one half of the pie.
So I'm going to eat one half of the pie.
So this one half.
I'll eat this whole one half of the pie.
So what does that equal?
"Well, there's a couple of ways we could think about it."
"First we could just re-write one half. one half of the pie, that's actually the same thing as two fourths, right?"
There's one fourth here and then another one fourth here.
"So one half is the same thing as two over four, and we know that from the equivalent fractions module."
"So we know that one fourth plus one half, this is the same thing as saying one fourth plus two fourths, right?"
"And all I did here is I changed the one half to a two fourths, by essentially multiplying the numerator and the denominator of this fraction by two."
And you can do that to any fraction.
"As long as you multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number, you can multiply by anything."
That makes sense because one half times one is equal to one half.
You know that.
"Well another way of writing one is one half times two over two. two over two is the same thing as one, and that equals two over four."
The reason why I picked two is because I wanted to get the same denominator here.
I hope I'm not completely confusing you.
"Well, let's just finish up this problem."
"So we have one fourth plus two fourths, so we know that we just add the numerators, three, and the denominators are the same, three fourths."
"And if we look at the picture, true enough, we have eaten three fourths of this pie."
Let's do another one.
Let's do one half plus one third.
"Well once again, we want to get both denominators to be the same, but you can't just multiply one of them to get -- there's nothing I can multiply three by to get two, or there's no, at least, integer I can multiply three by to get two."
And there's nothing I can multiply two by to get three.
So I have to multiply both of them so they equal each other.
"We're saying that it's a negative emotion because it does, and I've seen it many times, actually stop a person's growth for weeks, for years."
"You're disabled for the time that you're grieving, until there usually comes a time when you transcend that, you go through it, past it."
"And the quicker that happens, the better.."
I would say.
And certainly if you look in the Buddhist texts the grief was never encouraged by the Buddha.
"He would always actually say that the wise person is beyond that grief, could understand the nature of life and death, and in that understanding could let that nature be."
And never fight battles which you can't win.
"There's a famous Buddhist story, it's in the Dhammapada, I'll just go on with this, it's a man who cried for the moon."
"A man who lost his only son, and would go to the cremation ground every evening to cry and cry and cry, and his family let him cry for a while."
"But when he was crying overmuch they wanted to find some way of overcoming his grief which was going on far too long, ruining his health and his business as I've seen happen."
"They hired an actor and the actor went to the cremation ground also, and the actor was crying more than the father who'd lost his son."
"When they met together, these two men crying their eyes out, the actor crying more, the actor asked, ""what are you crying for?"" He said, ""I've"
lost my son.
"He's dead..""."
"""What are you crying for,"" said the father to the actor."
"""I'm crying for the moon""."
"""What do you mean, crying for the moon?"" ""It's my birthday last week, and my father asked me - what do you want?"
And I said I want the moon please.
"And my father wouldn't get it for me, and I'm so upset.. I'm crying for the moon."" And the father said,"
"""You're stupid."
You're crazy!
Why are you crying for?
"No-one can give you the moon!"""
"""You call me crazy,"" said the actor, ""You're crying for your dead son."
At least you can see the moon!
"Where is your dead son?"" [laughter]."
"And at that, this is a story, an old story, in the Buddhist texts, at that, the man realised what he was doing, he was crying for something you can never get."
Grieving for something which you can't change.
"And that was enough for him to stop his grief, go back to work, and move on with his life."
"The story of the man who cried for the moon, in the Dhammapada."
"But as for John Howard, yeah we respect him, but we crack jokes about him."
People crack jokes about everybody in Australia.
"The good news is, that you'll get feedback immediately from the computer as you're taking them."
"And, and for the assignments, you have the whole week."
"Whereas for the final, I'll let you know how much time you have."
"The real good news however, is because I'm interested in you learning rather than just testing you just once and saying, forget about it."
This guy or gal doesn't know something.
"I'm more interested in what you know, rather than what you don't know."
So I'll give you two attempts at each of one of these.
"Each assignment two attempts, final two attempts."
"But you have to finish within the deadlines, both attempts."
Otherwise you cannot.
The score cannot count.
"We have to have some criteria, right?"
"Now, dealing with me or the teaching assistant and this is one of the things that I think is a little bit of a disadvantag e in the online class."
This class is really large.
I do not want to get into the numbers because I want you to think of this class as just for you and I mean I think that's the beauty of online class.
So it's a
"large class, what can't we do?"
"I would encourage you, please don't attempt to contact me, or my teaching assistant Nathan Brown."
And the reason is you can easily find our emails and shoot an email.
"It's not that, we don't love you."
I love you all.
"There's a heart that beats in each one of you and that's my requirement for loving, you know."
"And in fact even plants have lives, right?"
"So, but in anyway, I'm coming back to the basics."
"I cannot afford to answer emails and Nathan cannot, because it would become unmanageable at our end."
So we encourage you not to try to contact us.
So what will we do?
We'll provide all the resources on a weekly basis.
"They'll come, you'll know what you want, you'll know exactly what, what's needed to be done and the teaching assistant, Nathan, will monitor the class for any errors, and so on, so forth."
But our goal is to make this class self-sufficient.
How?
"There's only one teaching assistant, and only one of me."
"Now, if you remember that problem, and even just to do that problem, when we thought about this statement, such that the trace of A is not divisible by p, we figured out that this was exactly equal to saying that A does not equal 0."
"So one way to view the result of problem 43 is if you assume that A is not equal to 0, there are p minus 1 squared members of T sub p where the determinant is divisible by p."
So we're starting to count some of the A's whose determinant is divisible by p.
But these are the only-- the matrix A's whose a entry is not equal to 0.
"So if we want to count all of them, we have to also count the ones where a does equal 0, so where a does equal 0."
So let's think about that case.
"We can figure out how many matrices there are where a does equal 0, and the determinant of A is divisible by p."
Add it to that.
Then we have the total number of A's whose determinants are divisible by p.
"And we could subtract that from the total number of possibilities, and hopefully, we'll get one of the answers up here."
So let's think a little bit about what will the determinant look like over here?
"So in this situation, the determinant of our matrix will be-- it's a squared."
"It's a times a minus b times c, a squared minus bc."
"Now, we're assuming that a is equal to 0."
"If a is equal to 0, it's equal to negative bc."
"And we need to think about how is this going to be a multiple, or how is this going to be divisible by p?"
So this has got to be equal to some multiple of p.
"So the first thing, just think about b's and the c's."
They are both non-negative.
So this value right here cannot be negative.
"So if you put a negative sign there, it cannot be positive."
So it can't be any positive multiples of p.
It could be 0.
So we could have negative bc.
"We could have negative bc is equal to 0, which is equivalent to saying that bc is equal to 0."
"That's one possibility, where it equals 0 times p."
That's still a multiple.
Or maybe it could be negative.
Maybe we could have negative bc is equal to negative 1 times p.
"But when you think about it here, if this was true, that would mean that bc is equal to p, so b or c would be factors of p."
"Now, we know that p is a prime number."
"Its factors are only 1 and p. b and c-- I mean, one of these guys could be 1, but then the other guy would have to be p."
"Come on, you know, representing sets of integers, this is pretty dumb."
Suppose I want to have a set of characters.
How could I do that?
"Well the idea of a hash, in fact, what's called a hash function is to have some way of mapping any kind of data into integers."
"So let's look at the second example, all right, -- I keep doing that -- this piece of code from here to here gives me a way of now creating a hash table of size 256."
Ord as a built in python representation.
There is lots of them around that takes any character and gives you back an integer.
"In fact, just to show that to you, if I go down here and I type ord, sorry, I did that wrong."
Let me try again.
We'll get to exceptions in a second.
I give it some character.
It gives me back an integer representing.
It looks weird.
Why is three come back to some other thing?
That's the internal representation that python uses for this.
"If I give it some other character, yeah, it would help if I could type, give it some other character."
It gives me back a representation.
So now here's the idea.
"I build a list 256 elements long, and I fill it up with those special characters none."
That's what create is going to do right here.
"And then hash character takes in any string or character, single character, gives me back a number."
Notice what I do.
"If I want to create a set or a sequence representing these things, I simply insert into that list."
It goes through and puts ones in the right place.
"And then, if I want to find out if something's there,"
I do the same thing.
"But notice now, hash is converting the input into an integer."
"So, what's the idea?"
"If I know what my hash function does, it maps, in this case characters into a range zero to 256, which is zero to 255,"
"I create a list that long, and I simply mark things."
And my look up is still constant.
Characters are simple.
"So almost, but not quite, everything I need to do."
Someone want to point out to me what it is I have failed to consider in this situation.
[Inaudible].
It's the what?
[Inaudible].
Yeah. ? trying to make null point to something [inaudible].
Exactly.
So if my queue is totally empty.
So in these cases like
"- one thing you can often think about whenever you see yourself with this error, and you're dereferencing something, you have to considered, well, is there a possibility that that value is null."
And if so I'd better do something to protect against it.
"So in the case of the new cell here, I'm setting aside and not clearing that cell."
"We know it's valid, [inaudible], we've got good memory."
"That part's good but the access to the tail, and that's assuming there is a tail, that there is at least one cell already in the queue that the tail is pointing to."
"When that's not true, this is going to blow up."
It's going to try to dereference it.
So what we can do here is we can just check for that.
We can say if the queue is empty then what we want to do is say that head equals tail equals new cell.
"Otherwise, we've got some existing tail and we just need to attach to it."
"Now, this is what I meant about that often there are little bit of special cases for certain different inputs."
"In particular, the most common ones are an empty list or a single link list being distinguished from a list that has two or more elements."
So sometimes it's all about - a single link list has problems and so does the empty list.
"In this case, it's exactly the empty list."
"Like a single cell is actually fine, you know, one, ten, 6,000 all work equally well."
It's that empty case that we have to work on setting our head and tail to that.
So with this plan we go back to my use of this.
"And stop talking about my stack and change into my queue, end queuing instead of pushing."
[Inaudible].
"Oh, 591 errors."
"Well, that's really - 591, what is that?"
[Inaudible].
"Oh, yeah, this is the year I was going to talk about but I failed to do."
"And that was talking about how if you stretch out heart cells, and all of the things within heart cells-- all the proteins-- that it actually changes the force of contraction."
"And actually, force of contraction is very much related to this length-tension relationship as well."
So I'm going to put that up here.
Force of contraction.
"And instead of using that terminology, though, we're going to use the term tension."
"I mean, you can essentially think of them the same way."
"But classically, the word tension is what everyone uses."
So we're going to use that same word.
"And then, as far as length, specifically the length that we're talking about is the length of a sarcomere."
So I'm going to write sarcomere here.
"And the sarcomere, just keep in mind, is really going from one z-disc to another z-disc."
"So to draw this out, to actually write it out maybe, we can start with myosin."
"And so maybe this is our myosin, right here."
And I'll draw some myosin heads here.
"And maybe some myosin heads on this side, as well."
"And, of course, you know it's going to be symmetric looking, roughly symmetric."
So this is our myosin.
"And actually, I'm going to make some copies of it now, just to make sure that I don't have to keep drawing it out for you."
But something like that.
"And we'll move it to be just below so that you can actually see, when I draw a few of them, how they differ from one another."
"So I'm going to put them, as best I can, right below one another."
"And we'll do a total of, let's say, five."
"And I think, by the time we get to the fifth one, you'll get an idea of what this overall graph will look like."
So these are our five myosins.
"And to start out at the top, I'm going to show a very crowded situation."
So this will be what happens when really nothing is spread out.
"It's very, very crowded."
"And you recall that you have actin, this box, or this half box that I'm drawing, is our actin."
"And then you have two of them, right?"
"And they have their own polarity, we said."
And they kind of go like that.
"And so, in this first scenario, this very, very first one that I'm drawing, this is our scenario one."
"let's say it's this one fourth of the pie, right?"
And we're going to add it to another one fourth of the pie.
Let's make it this one-- let me change the color-- pink.
"This one fourth, this pink one fourth is this one fourth of the pie."
"So if I were to eat both one fourths, or one fourth and then I eat another one fourth, how much have I eaten?"
"Well, you could look from just the picture,"
I have now eaten two out of the four pieces of the pie.
"So if I eat one fourth of a piece of pie or one fourth of a pie, and then I eat another one fourth of a pie,"
I will have eaten two fourths of the pie.
"And we know from the equivalent fractions module that this is the same thing as that I've eaten one half of the pie, which makes sense."
"If I eat two out of four pieces of a pie, then I've eaten one half of it."
"And if we look at it mathematically, what happened here?"
"Well the denominators or the bottom numbers, the bottom numbers in the fraction stayed the same."
Because that's just the total number of pieces that I have in this example.
"Well, I added the numerators, which makes sense."
"I had one out of the four pieces of pie, then I ate another one out of the four pieces of pie, so I ate two out of the four pieces of pie, which is one half."
Let me do a couple more examples.
What is two fifths plus one fifth?
Well we do the same thing here.
We first check to make sure the denominators are the same.
We'll learn in a second what we do when the denominators are different.
"If the denominators are the same, the denominator of the answer will be the same."
"And we just add the numerators. two fifths plus one fifth is just two plus one over five, which is equal to three over five."
And it works the same way with subtraction.
"If I had three over seven minus two over seven, that just equals one over seven."
"I just subtracted the three, I subtracted the two from the three to get one and I kept the denominator the same."
Which makes sense.
"If I have three out of the seven pieces of a pie, and I were to give away two out of the seven pieces of a pie,"
I'd be left with one of the seven pieces of a pie.
So now let's tackle-- I think it should be pretty straightforward when we have the same denominator.
"Remember, the denominator is just the bottom number in a fraction."
Numerator is the top number.
I'm going to show you one last technique.
"And in fact, we're going to put quotes around the word better, but it does better than even this kind of binary search, and that's a method called hashing."
"You've actually seen hashing, you just don't know it."
Hashing is the the technique that's used in Python to represent dictionaries.
Hashing is used when you actually come in to Logan
Airport and Immigration or Homeland Security checks your picture against a database.
Hashing is used every time you enter a password into a system.
So what in the world is hashing?
"Well, let me start with a simple little example."
Suppose I want to represent a collection of integers.
This is an easy little example.
And I promise you that the integers are never going to be anything other than between the range of zero to nine.
"OK, so it might be the collection of one and five."
"It might be two, three, four, eight."
"I mean some collection of integers, but I guarantee you it's between zero and nine."
Here's the trick I can play.
"I can build -- I can't count -- I could build a list with spots for all of those elements, zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine."
"And then when I want to create my set, I could simply put a one everywhere that that integer falls."
"So if I wanted to represent, for example, this is the set two, six and eight, I put a one in those slots."
"This seems a little weird, but bear with me for second, in fact, I've given you a little piece a code to do it, which is the next piece of code on the hand out."
So let's take a look at it for second.
This little set of code here from create insert and number.
What's create do?
"It says, given a low and a high range, in this case it would be zero to nine."
I'm going to build a list.
"Right, you can see that little loop going through there."
What am I doing?
I'm creating a list with just that special symbol none in it.
So I'm building the list.
I'm returning that as my set.
"And then to create the object, I'll simply do a set of inserts."
"If I want the values two, six and eight in there, I would do an insert of two into that set, an insert of six into that set, and an insert of eight into the set."
"And maybe eh, the star goes first so he sets the balance to 100, 500 minus 400."
"And then the buffalo sets the balance to negative 200, 100 minus 300."
And you know what we just did?
We just robbed the bank.
[LAUGH]
And then they both report true and you've got 200 dollars ahead.
"And that's not to good Actually BYOB will try to stop most of these, and this case it does."
There's no raised condition here because
"BYOB fixes it but this code does create race case, Race Condition."
There're two more problems of concurency problems that we want to talk about.
The first one is a deadlock.
The two people or multiple threads or multiple cores are trying to grab the same information but they won't give up the information that the other needs.
"So in this case, eh, two people are, need to draw a graph and one grabs the pencil, the other grabs the paper and the guy with the pencil wont let go of his pencil until he gets the paper and draws his graph."
And the guy with the paper wont let go of the paper until he gets the pencil.
"And they're just stuck there, always waiting, and that's not to good."
There's also this image of these cars that none of them can move forward because there's a car in front of them.
"I think if this guy got out it would slowly get fixed, but it's a bit hard."
[LAUGH].
"Similarly, there's a livelock."
"When, deadlocks are very common and eh,"
"You say, okay if you've got the pencil or the paper and you can't get the other one maybe you can put yours down for a minute and come back, and that's a good way to solve it right?"
"But what happens if both people, one grabs the pencil, one grabs the paper and tries to grab the other one but they can't."
"So they both put it down at the same time, they both go away for a minute, they both come back, grab the same one and they can't get the other one again."
"So they put it down, go away, they come back and they still can't do it."
And that's a livelock.
"You're trying to get rid of it and, but because your algorithm eh, keeps matching itself, it actually doesn't work."
"The other very common example eh, that we love, and I'll let Dan and Luke show it to you guys when they do, is that if two people are trying to pass each other in a hallway sometimes you both lean in the same way and then the other, but livelock is that you infinitely do this."
That you just can't get out.
You're stuck in the hallway all night.
What to do?
Cool.
"So in summary this move to parallelism is a big sea"" change""."
"For a while, we were real high alert."
We sat there in the airplanes with the...
With two of everything ready to go.
"And we put an extra 26,000 pounds of fuel onboard so we can carry like 90,000 pounds of fuel, so we can fly for a day and a half."
"Because if you found them, and you dropped the... you'd stay on station to... but it was all contingency and fortunately we never had to use it."
"They'd always come down, the Navy picked them up."
It was great.
"So, what you were doing - you'd, in the event they couldn't be picked up because of rough seas or something, you would - ?"
"No, we were there say they come down off the coast of Argentina"
"Okay someplace that they just circled the orbit or whatever and it might have happened, you know."
"So, all these orbits, you can see on the maps where they circle over Russia or over China."
"And like I said, our planes there, they didn't even hesitate, they just come right out... the capsule comes down in your territory, there'll be a C-130 within a couple hours right there and you don't touch it, you don't do anything, and you definitely don't touch the airplane coming in."
"And then if they can land, of course they would."
"Otherwise, the paramedics would jump out and do their thing."
Wouldn't need the flotation stuff but that was just a contingency because it was so primitive.
"You've seen the capsules, you know."
"If something malfunctioned, or functioned too good then they'd push those little jet streams on there and they either could go 2,000 miles one way or the other."
"So, like I said, it was a job."
And I don't know which ones I've met.
My flight orders don't show that.
"It just shows, you know..."
And it was partly to reassure them that you'd be there and the contingency that's why the astronauts flew with you
"Well, yeah, that, and just for their ideas."
Yes.
We were cargo haulers and we dropped thousands of parachute troopers.
"We dropped 80 at a time, 4 or 5 times a day."
You'd drop a couple 300 or 400 a day sometimes.
So we knew how to air drop and different ways of doing it.
"Low level, you know."
So that wasn't the deal.
The deal was you have to put these paramedics out at the capsule in the middle of the ocean and it didn't make any difference if - the army won't drop if it's over ten or twelve miles an hour wind.
We put these guys out in gale winds.
Sub-string search.
So first thing is how to compute the hash function.
"So we take the, just convert the Math."
So R's our Radix.
"So in this example, we're using ten so we have decimal numbers."
"And then the digits, say t's of i That's the text characters."
"So we have a number x of I, which is the,"
"M characters starting at position I. And that's just in Math, ti*R to the M-1"
"So you know, in this case that's two10000+61000+5100+310+5 that's just"
Math for that.
And our goal is so it's an N digit base based our integer modular Q And our and our goal is to do the math.
That gives us the remainder that we would get when dividing that by Q well there's really easy method called Horner's Method that we can use to evaluate a degree in polynomials just with a multiplied M multiply and add.
"And we can do the modular computation all the way through at each step, to keep the numbers less than q and we still get the same result."
"And so the idea is, you multiply by R."
"You go from left to right through the digits and you just multiply by R and add the digit, and then do mod q at every time."
So we start with two mod 97 is two.
To six mod 987 is two*10+6 mod 987 and that's 26.
And then I take that value.
Multiply by ten and add five that's 265 mod 997.
"In that case it's, it's 265."
So 265*10+3 is 2653.
"Our remainder is divided by 997, it's 659, so even though our number gets bigger than 997, might take them out every time, we keep our running total less than 997."
And then the last step is to take the 659.
Basically we've thrown out a bunch of multiples of 997 that we don't care about.
And 659*10+5 mod 997 is exactly equal to 26535 mod 997 and that's 613.
That's our value.
"So that's A using Horner's method we got a, well known linear time method to do compute or hash function with this simple code."
"And this notice will work even for a huge key that we wouldn't compute a hundred dig, convert a hundred digit key in to some number to do the calculation."
We do one digit at a time using Horner's method and then we have no limit because we're always keeping our numbers less than our prime queue.
"So that's a first step, so no matter how big the pattern is,"
"We can efficiently compute a hash or, since that is the first step."
So now the second step for the Rabin Karp algorithm is to realize that if we know xi mod q we can efficiently compute xi+1 mod q cause they have a lot of digits in common.
So let's say that you are going to make $100 down payment on an item then you are going to pay $100 a month for 24 months.
Okay?
"So, if we are going to pay $100 a month for 24 months that means we are going to pay $2,400."
Does that make sence?
"Because we would take the $100 times 24 months, which would give us $2,400."
"We have already paid $100 down so that makes it $2,500 that we have paid for the item if we pay it over a 24 month period."
"So, in other words, if it takes us two years to pay for it."
"If we would have paid cash for it in this particular case, we would have paid $2,200."
So what you have to consider is it worth $300 to finance it over the next 24 months versus putting that $100 a month in a savings account for the next 24 months and just paying cash for the item.
"And, if I wait the 24 months then hopefully it might cost the same thing."
"Will it cost the same thing, the 2,200 instead of me having to pay the $2,500 it would cost to finance it?"
And that is something you need to look at before you make a major purchase if you don't have the cash for that purchase.
So one of the things that I want you to think about.
"Lets, look at the chapter."
This chapter looks at practical buying strategies and talks about some different things you need to think about before you actually buy.
One of those things is time and purchases.
There are good times to buy cars and there are bad times to buy cars.
There are good times to buy new TV's and there are bad times to buy new TV's.
"So, this gives you some ideas and some suggestions on what you need to do."
"Another thing that you need to make sure to do, try not to get too emotional with what you are buying."
A lot of times we go to the car lot and we find this car and we are just so..That is The vehicle that I have to have!
If you have that in mind.
"If you know that nothing else is going to meet your needs then it is going to be very, very hard to negotiate on that vehicle."
"So, you have to have a back-up plan."
"You have to say, Okay that is the car I really, really want, but if I don't get it that's okay because I found this other one that I am willing to take."
"So, then you have negotiating power."
"And I will tell you, when you go to buy a car, they are going to use it."
Have you ever!
This has never happened.
I have never gone to buy a car that I wasn't told someone else is looking at it.
"You know isn't it kind of funny that you have been watching that car for two or three months or maybe six months and the day you decide to go try it out and drive it, someone else is looking at it and is probably going to buy it before the day is over."
It's a marketing strategy!
"So given that this is theta and this is 90 - theta, what is our angle going to be?"
"Well they all, collectively, add up to 180 degrees."
So you have theta + (90-theta) + our mystery angle is going to be equal to 180 degrees.
"The thetas cancel out (theta - theta), and you have 90 + our mystery angle is a 180 degrees,"
We subtract 90 from both sides.) - and you are left with your mystery angle equalling 90 degrees.
So that all worked out well.
So let me make that clear.
That's going to be useful for us.
So now we can say definitively that this is 90 degrees.
This is a right angle.
"Now what we are going to do, is we are going to construct a trapezoid."
"This side 'a' is parallel to side 'b' down here the way its been constructed and this is just one side right over here, this goes straight up and now let's just connect these two sides right over there."
So there's a couple of ways to think about the area of this trapezoid.
"One is we can just think of it as a trapezoid and come up with its area,"
And then we could think about it as the sum of the areas of its components.
So let's just first think of it as trapezoid.
"So, what do we know about the area of the trapezoid?"
"The area of a trapezoid,is gonna be the height of the trapezoid, which is (a+b) times, the way I think of it, the mean or average of the top and the bottom."
"So, ar(trapezoid) = (a+b) x 1/2(a+b)"
"In the intuition there you are taking the height times the average of the bottom and the top, gives you the area of the trapezoid."
"Now, how can we also figure out the area with its component parts?"
"So as far as we do the correct things, we should come up with the same result. so how else can we come up with this area?"
"Well, we could say it's the area of the two right triangles."
The area of each of them is one half of a times b.
"But there's two of them, Let me do that say in blue colour,"
"But there's two of these right triangles, so let's multiply them by two."
"So 2 times half ab, that takes into consideration this bottom right triangle, and this top one. and what's the area of this large one, that I'll colour in green"
"Well that's pretty straightforward, it's just one half c times c."
"So, plus one half c times c, which is one half c square."
"Now , let's simplify this thing and see what we come up with and you might guess where all of this is going."
"So, we can rearrange this."
"So this one half times (a+b) squared is going to be equal to two times one half, well that's just going to be one, so its gonna be equal to a times b plus one half c squared."
Go back over here to this side and I've got to make everything now consistent with what's going on there.
Okay.
"Let's start off with our constructor, which is a good place to make sure you get into a valid state."
"In this case, we're going to use the empty list so the head pointer points and tells us we have no cells whatsoever in the list."
"So we don't pre allocate anything, we don't get ready."
What's kind of nice with this linked list is to allocate on demand each individual cell that's asked to be added to the list.
The delete operation actually does show we need to do some work.
"I'm actually not going to implement it but I'm going to mention here that I would need to delete the entire list, which would involve, either iterates or recursion my way down to kind of do all the work."
And then I changed this from size to iterate.
I'd like to know if my list is empty.
"So I can just test for head is equal, equal to null."
If it's null we have no list.
Let me work on push before I work on pop.
I'll turn them around.
"The push operation is, make myself a new cell."
"All right, let's go through the steps for that."
New cell equals new cell
T. [Inaudible] the size to hold a value and an X link.
I'm going to set the new styles val to be the perimeter that came in.
"And now, I'm going to splice this guy onto the front of my list."
So the outgoing pointer I'm doing first to the new cell is allocated and
leads to what was previously the front row cell.
And then it is now updated to point to this one.
"We've got pointer wired, one value assigned, and we've got a new cell on the front."
"The inverse of that, taking something off my list, I'm going to need to kind of detach that front row cell, delete its memory, get its value, things like that."
So the error checking is still the same at the very beginning.
"Like, if I've got an empty staff I want to be sure I don't just kind of do reference no and get into some bad situations."
"So I report that error back using error, which will halt the program there."
"Otherwise, right, the element on top is the one that's in the value field of the head cell."
So knowing that head's null is a safety reference to do there.
And then I'm going to go ahead and get a hold of what that thing is and I'm going update the head to point to the cell after it.
So splicing it out and then deleting the old cell.

He lived through the rules of five monarchs through the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Rising from a lowly page at the court of the House of Stuart, he faithfully served the Duke of York through the 1670s and early 1680s. This gave him military and political advancement through his brave, clever skill. Churchill helped secure James on the throne."
"However, just three years later he left his Catholic teacher for the Protestant Dutchman, William of Orange. For his help in the Glorious Revolution, William at his coronation made him Earl of Marlborough (pronounced /'mɔ:l b""ə""ɹə/). He served in the early years of the Nine Years' War and became famous. However, charges of Jacobitism made him fall from office. For some time, he was imprisoned in the Tower. When Queen Anne came to throne in 1702, however, Marlborough secured his fame and lots of money."
"His marriage to the quick-tempered Sarah Jennings – Anne's close friend – helped Marlborough's rise. He first became the Captain-Generalcy of British forces. Then he became a duke. Later, he became the richest of all Anne's subjects. Although in the end he could not completely crush his enemies, his victories allowed Britain to rise to very great power. Through him, the country grew more and more rich through the 18th century."

Not wanting to be left behind, however, rival Banque Nationale de Paris made a hostile USD $21-billion counter-offer for Paribas, and an unimaginable, separate USD 19.6-billion offer for Societe Generale (SocGen). BNP’s three-way merger proposal would have created the world's largest bank."

In the end, BNP succeeded in breaking SocGen and Paribas' merger plan, and acquired Paribas to form BNP Paribas. However, it could only secure 31.5% of SocGen's shares.

Breath sounds
Breath sounds are the sounds made by air as it moves through the respiratory system. Breath sounds are also called lung sounds or respiratory sounds. Sometimes they can be heard by anyone; other times they can be heard only by listening to the lungs and airways with a stethoscope.
"To describe and identify breath sounds, medical professionals usually use auscultation (they listen with a stethoscope). They listen while the patient is breathing in, and while they are breathing out. They listen to both lungs, at both the chest and the back, starting at the bottom and working their way up. They listen to whether the pitch of the breath sounds is low, medium or high. They also listen to whether the sounds are soft, medium, loud, or very loud)."
Abnormal Breath Sounds.
There are many kinds of breath sounds that are not normal. These are called adventitious breath sounds. Each different kind of abnormal breath sound is a sign of a different problem. Some of the most common abnormal breath sounds are:
Wheezing.
"Wheezing is usually high-pitched. It sounds musical, like whistling. Usually, wheezing is heard first when a person is breathing out. If it gets worse, wheezing starts happening when the patient breathes in and out."
Christian creeds.
"It is likely that the earliest creed of Christianity that deserves the title in full is the Apostles' Creed. The Apostles' Creed seems to have been formulated to resist Gnosticism; it emphasizes the birth, physical death, and bodily Resurrection of Jesus Christ. It reads:"
"The Nicene Creed is clearly derived from the Apostles' Creed, and represents an elaboration of its basic themes. The most important additions to this creed are much more elaborate statements concerning Christology and the Trinity."
"Christians today probably use the Nicene Creed most widely, followed by the Apostles' Creed."
"Jewish Creed: the ""Shmah""."
"The Jewish faith recognizes a single creed called the Shmah or Shema Yisrael, a statement of faith in strict unitarian monotheism, the belief in one God. This creed is embodied in a single prayer recited twice a day: ""Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One"", also translated as ""Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is unique [""or"" alone]."""
In Hebrew: שמע ישראל אדני אלהינו אדני אחד
"This is pronounced phonetically in Hebrew: ""Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad""."
Islamic creeds.
"The most basic attempt to put the religion of Islam in a brief statement of doctrine is the shahada, the proclamation that there is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His prophet."
More detailed credal declarations of Islamic dogma constitute aqidah.
The six Sunni articles of belief are:
"Also from the Aqidah of the Salaf is the belief that the faith (i.e. Eemaan) consists of (both) speech and action and that it increases and decreases. This differs from the Murji’ah a sect who uphold the belief of “Irjaa’”-to hold that sins major and minor, do not affect the faith and that faith neither increases nor decreases."
"And they uphold the belief that the Quran is the Speech of Allah, His Revelation and Light. It is not created, since the Quran is from Allah and that which is from Allah is not created. One of the attributes of Allah is his Speech. Since His attributes have been with Him eternally, His Speech cannot be created and therefore, the Quran is not created. According to the Salaf, debating about it is disbelief. It is not denied except by a Jahmee. A Jahmee is one who denies Allah’s attributes."

His territory was then defined as stretching from Chesapeake Bay to what is now Hampshire County, West Virginia."
"The original plan of the town called for ten blocks, which form the core of Culpeper's downtown area today. The original town was surveyed by a young George Washington. In 1795, the town received a post office under the name ""Culpeper Court House"" Most maps of the time, however, continued to show the Fairfax name. The confusion resulting from the difference in official and postal names was finally resolved when the Virginia Assembly formally renamed the town Culpeper in 1869 (Acts, 1869–1870, chapter 118, page 154)."
"During the American Revolutionary War, the Culpeper Minutemen, a pro-independence militia, formed in the town of Culpeper. They organized in what was then known as ""Clayton's Old Field,"" near today's Yowell Meadow Park."
"During the Civil War, Culpeper was a crossroads for a number of armies marching through central Virginia, with both Union and Confederate forces occupying the town by turn. In the heart of downtown, the childhood home of Confederate General A.P. Hill stands at the corner of Main and Davis streets. One block north on Main St. (present location of Piedmont Realty) was the frame house where ""The Gallant Major"" John Pelham died after being wounded at the Battle of Kelly's Ford."

"Béarnaise sauce is often wrongly called ""Bernaise sauce"", as if it were from ""Bern"", the capital city of Switzerland, which is in no way connected with this sauce or its origins."
"Some assume Béarnaise refers to the Béarn region, a former province now in the ""département"" of Pyrénées-Atlantiques, in southwestern Franceto refer to the region of Béarn However, the sauce has no tradition in the cooking of the area, and Larousse has the name honouring Henri IV of France, a native of Béarn, and for whom the restaurant where the sauce was first shown was named. Henri IV was often known as le Grand Béarnais"

Period 8 element
"A period 8 element would be an element in the eighth period (row) of the periodic table. No period 8 elements have been proven to exist. These elements are almost certainly too big to exist in nature, so they would be synthetic elements. They would probably decay very quickly, because of radioactivity, so they would have very short half-lives. However, some scientists believe that an island of stability may exist in this range, which would be more stable and have longer half-lives. Some of these elements would be part of a new category of elements, called superactinides."

"Bragg was always known as Sir Lawrence Bragg, and his father was Sir William Bragg. Lawrence Bragg was educated in Adelaide, Australia and in England. He was awarded the Military Cross in World War I."
"Lawrence Bragg discovered (1912) the Bragg law of X-ray diffraction, the basis of X-ray crystallography. He was joint winner (with his father, Sir William Bragg) of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1915."
"To date, Lawrence Bragg is the youngest Nobel Laureate. He was the director of the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, when the discovery of the structure of DNA was made by James D. Watson and Francis Crick in February 1953."
"He was elected an FRS in 1921. He was knighted by George VI in 1941, and received both the Copley Medal and the Royal Medal of the Royal Society."
Hoverfly
"Hoverflies, sometimes called 'flower flies' or 'syrphid flies', are the insect family Syrphidae. Hoverflies mimic wasp stripes, and are usually smaller than wasps. Thus to a bird they may look scarcely worth eating, and dangerous."
"As their common name suggests, they are often seen hovering or sucking nectar at flowers. The adults of many species feed mainly on nectar and pollen, while the larvae (maggots) eat a wide range of foods."
"In some species, the larvae are saprotrophs, eating decaying plant and animal matter in the soil or in ponds and streams. In other species, the larvae are insectivores and prey on aphids, thrips, and other plant-sucking insects."
"Aphids alone cause tens of millions of dollars of damage to crops worldwide every year. Hoverflies are important natural enemies of these pests, and can be used in biological control. Some adult syrphid flies are important pollinators. Some orchids mimic aphid alarm scent (pheromones), which attracts hoverflies. The hoverflies then pollinate the orchids."
"About 6,000 species in 200 genera have been described. Hoverflies are common throughout the world and can be found on most continent except Antarctica."
"Hoverflies are harmless to most other animals despite their mimicry of the black and yellow stripes of wasps. They are a classic example of Batesian mimicry. The Batesian mimic is a sheep in wolf's clothing: it looks like something dangerous or which tastes disgusting, but in reality it is good to eat. Hover flies look roughly like little wasps, and their warning colouration is well-known to birds."
"Unlike adults, the maggots of hoverflies feed on a variety of foods. Predatory species benefit farmers and gardeners, because aphids destroy crops. Hoverfly maggots are often used in biological control."
Atomkraft
"Atomkraft are an English heavy metal band who were part of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal movement. They formed in 1979 and disbanded 1988.

Commerzbank Tower
"Commerzbank Tower is a skyscraper in Frankfurt am Main, Hessen, Germany. At 259 meters, or 850 feet (300 meters with antenna included), it is Germany's tallest skyscraper and the third tallest building in Europe. It was completed and opened in 1997."
"Commerzbank Tower is located in Frankfurt's district ""Innenstadt"" in the centre of the city. It is home to the headquarters of the second largest German bank, Commerzbank."
History.
"From 1970 onwards, the previous head offices were centralised in Frankfurt am Main, where the legal seat has also been located since 1990. In the early 1990s, Commerzbank sought to build a new skyscraper in the center of Frankfurt am Main. The aim was to consolidate a large part of the rented locations in the city. The extraordinary skyscraper was designed by Lord Norman Foster. Since 1997, the tower has been a prominent feature of the Frankfurt skyline and is regarded as a model for environmentally friendly and energy-saving architecture."
Architecture.
"The floor plan forms a triangle with slightly outwardly curved sides. The tower appears open and transparent due to the atrium, also triangular. A double-skin facade encloses the building. The stepped top of the tower creates a striking building termination and sets an expressive sign for the banking district. The building was constructed from 1994 to 1997 and cost 600 million DM. It has 56 floors and an area of 109,200 square metres. The architect who designed the building is Norman Foster. The skyscraper weighs about 200,000 tonnes and contains 18,800 tonnes of steel - twice as much as the Eiffel Tower in Paris."
Green Building.
"The architect and his client worked together to make the Commerzbank tower innovatively environmentally- and climate-friendly. Natural ventilation and environmentally-friendly air conditioning create a long-term contribution to climate protection. The tower has been supplied entirely with ""green"" electricity since the beginning of 2008 and - like all Commerzbank buildings - is cleaned exclusively with biodegradable cleaning products. In 2009 the city of Frankfurt awarded the Commerzbank tower the ""Green Building Frankfurt"" award."
Present.
"The magnificent building at the Kaiserplatz in Frankfurt is the Commerzbank's Head Office, and 2.800 people work there."

"MesseTurm is a skyscraper in Frankfurt am Main, Hesse, Germany. In English it is known as the ""Trade Fair Tower"". It is Germany's second tallest, and at the time of its building, it was the tallest building in Europe. It is the fourth tallest building in Europe. It is 257 metres (840 feet) tall."
"MesseTurm is located in Frankfurt's district ""Westend"". This is near the same named Trade Fair-Area in the centre of the city. It is home to the German headquarters of Reuters, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse."
"The construction began in 1988. It was finished in 1991. It was the tallest building in Europe, between 1991 and 1997. In 1997, Commerzbank Tower became the tallest building in Germany. It was only two metres higher than MesseTurm. The construction of the building's foundation set a world record. The world record was for the longest continuous concrete pour. Ninety trucks poured concrete for 78 hours. They poured it into the deep foundation."
"There is a pyramid on the very top of MesseTurm. It is tall. This makes it very different from other skyscrapers. Because of this shape, people in Germany often call it ""The Pencil."""

"The Irtysh River (; ; / ; , ""Twirl""; ) is a river in Siberia and Kazakhstan. It is the main tributary of the Ob River. The main tributary of the Irtysh is the Tobol River. The Ob-Irtysh forms a major drainage basin in Asia, and covers most of Western Siberia and the Altay Mountains."
"From its origins as the ""Kara-Irtysh"" (Vast Irtysh, kara means Vast in Turkic languages but also black. But in the context and geographic terms usually refers vast) in the Mongolian Altay mountains in Xinjiang, China, the Irtysh flows northwest through Lake Zaysan in Kazakhstan, meeting the Ishim and Tobol rivers before merging with the Ob near Khanty-Mansiysk in western Siberia, Russia after 4,248 kilometres (2,640 mi)."
"The name Black Irtysh (""Kara-Irtysh"" in Kazakh, or ""Cherny Irtysh"" in Russian) is applied by some authors, especially in Russia and Kazakhstan, to the upper course of the river, from its source entering Lake Zaysan. The term White Irtysh, in opposition to the Black Irtysh, was occasionally used in the past to refer to the Irtysh below lake Zaysan; now this usage is largely obsolete."

Interpretations of quantum mechanics
"In quantum mechanics, the mathematical formalism is very difficult to interpret physically. However, there are many ideas about the interpretations and meanings of quantum mechanics. There are no facts to prove any interpretation over the others, but there are some that are more accepted than others."
Background material.
"""Main article: Quantum mechanics"""
The main ideas of quantum mechanics are the postulates of Schrödinger and Heisenberg. The Schrödinger equation is a partial differential equation that describes the wavefunction of an object. The equation can be given by
formula_1
"The basic meaning of this equation is that a particle, such as an electron, is not ""just"" a point-like particle, but also a type of wave. The philosophical implications will be explored shortly. Another fundamental of quantum mechanics is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. This bizarre theory is the idea that the position and the momentum of an object cannot both be known. The greater the certainty of the ""position"" of an object, the less the certainty of the ""momentum"" of the object. The mathematical formulation of this is given by"
formula_2
This can further be generalized by stating that

Scuttled by PBS.
"The movie was approved for national broadcast in 1985, but that decision was rejected a year later. Many people believe that was censorship. B.J.Bullert commented that the PBS/KQED decision ""robbed a national public television audience"" . He extrapolates this critical remark to the media across the board and its failure to focus public attention on the putative biological hazard of nuclear power."
Critics.
"B.J. Bullert, in his book ""Public Television: Politics and the Battle over Documentary Film"" protested what he viewed as censorship. He stated that Dark Circle was outside of the mainstream at that time but now the viewpoint in the movie is widely accepted. Nat Katzman, former KQED station manager, disagreed. He is quoted in Bullert's book, saying ""It's more difficult to say (""Dark Circle"") falsified anything, but it left one with the uncomfortable feeling that this is propaganda, not journalism""."
Point of view.
"The movie is clearly created to raise public alarm about the hazards of nuclear power. It is also about problems at the regulatory agency, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). However, there are numerous points in the movie in which the voices heard are those of the workers. We also hear from the Pacific Gas and Electric management, and the lawyer for the NRC."

"In 1989, she co-produced and starred in a production of Cole Porter's ""Anything Goes"" in London, which made a star of John Barrowman. In the early 1990s, her term relationship with the lyricist Tim Rice stopped and Paige tried an image change by recording an album with a California-based producer in the Bette Midler torch singer vein entitled ""Love Can Do That"". Her solo albums had so far been a variety of songs, including the very successful ""Stages"" in 1983, with songs from musical theatre. In 1993, she returned to the United States to work with Peter Matz on an album called ""Romance and the Stage"" featuring songs from earlier days of musical theatre. The following year, she recorded, ""Piaf"", which had music from the role she was playing in the Pam Gems play, also called ""Piaf"". Critics were impressed by her acting skills in that play."
"However, in 1995 she had a role in another musical, playing Norma Desmond in Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""Sunset Boulevard"". She had always wanted to perform on Broadway and ""Sunset Boulevard"" now made this possible. For more than a year she played the role. She later had another role in 2000 with the ""King and I"". She has recently moved more into television and radio work."

"The dance is thought to have come from about 5,000 years ago when the Koreans believed that the Sun, Moon, and Earth controlled the world. The people (almost always girls in hanboks) would dance under the brightest full moon of the year in order to bring a good harvest."
"In the 16th century, when the Japanese were attacking Korea, Korea's Admiral Yi Sun-sin ordered women to do this dance. He told them to do this because he wanted to trick the Japanese into overestimating them. The women were said to have worn military uniforms and danced on Mount Okmae (옥매산)."
"On February 15, 1966, ganggangsullae was included in the list of the ""Important Cultural Properties of Korea"" #8."
Description.
"Traditionally, this dance performed without any instruments. Young and old women dance in a circle at night under the moonlight. They go outside in hanbok, traditional Korean clothing, hold hands, make a circle, and start rotating clockwise. The lead singer sings a line. Then, the rest of the people all sing, 'ganggangsullae'. Then the lead singer sings another line, and the rest of the people reply, 'ganggangsullae'. This is probably where the name of the song came from. As the dance continues, the tempo of the song can get faster. They sing about their personal hardships, relationships, and wants. During the dance, the women also play some games. The ganggangsullae can last until dawn."
Easter Bilby
The Easter Bilby is an Australian alternative to the Easter Bunny. Bilbies are an endangered species of Australian marsupials. Bilby shaped chocolates are sold in many Australian shops to raise money to help protect the bilbies.

Kuwait
"Kuwait is a small Arab country (about 17,819 square kilometers) in the Middle East."
"Kuwait is the most socially progressive country in the Gulf region. It has a small and rich economy. It has about 96 billion barrels of crude oil reserves. Crude oil reserves are the oil that is still under the ground and has not yet been cleaned up. Kuwait has 10% of all of the oil reserves in the world. The country makes a lot of money by selling oil. This money is almost half of all the money the country makes. The oil money is also 95% of the money made by selling things to different countries (people call that exports). Also, the oil money is 80% of the money the government makes. Kuwait is now talking with oil companies of other countries to make oil fields in the northern part of the country."
"Kuwait's weather makes farming hard (too little rain). Instead of farming, the country catches fish and buys food from other countries. About 75% of the country's water to drink has to be distilled (have the salt removed) or purchased from other countries."
"In 1990, Iraq invaded (brought an army in to fight against) Kuwait. This started the first Gulf War. Kuwait's official religion is Islam, although 15% of its population are Christian or Hindu. Arabic is mostly spoken in Kuwait but English is widespread among Kuwaitis (residents of Kuwait). Kuwait is one of the few nations that has education for every age."
Another interesting fact about Kuwait is that a lot of people speak English.

Governorates.
"Kuwait is divided into 6 governorates. The governorates are divided into districts, And the establishment of the governorates of Kuwait dates back to the Emiri Decree No. 6 issued in 1962, which divided Kuwait into three governorates: the Capital Governorate, Hawalli Governorate and Al-Ahmadi Governorate. The decree clarified the work of the governor, his subordination of the governor to the Ministry of Interior, and his responsibility towards security, provided that the Ministry of Interior issues the necessary decisions to indicate the limits of the governor's jurisdiction. There have been some changes regarding the governorates of Kuwait, which we summarize as follows:"
". On November 14, 1979: Some provisions of the administrative division decree were amended so that a fourth governorate, Al-Jahra Governorate, was added."
". On October 12, 1988: The first article of the article was amended to divide Kuwait into five governorates by adding Al-Farwaniyah Governorate."
". On November 27, 1999: Emiri Decree No. 290 was issued to add a sixth governorate, Mubarak Al-Kabeer Governorate."
"Thus, Kuwait has become administratively divided into six governorates, each affiliated with several regions. Warba Island and Bubiyan Island belong to the Jahra Governorate, while the rest of the islands belong to the Capital Governorate."

"The WaveBird controller has the same design as the normal GameCube controllers. It is a little bigger and heavier than the normal GameCube controllers. It has a dial for selecting the channel a person wants the controller on, an on/off switch, and an orange LED light which is used to show that the controller is turned on. The WaveBird does not have the rumble feature that the normal GameCube controller has, as that would make the battery last for a shorter amount of time."
"Like the normal GameCube controller, the WaveBird can be used with the Wii. It can be used for GameCube and Virtual Console titles, as well as with some Wii games and WiiWare titles. The WaveBird became more popular after the Wii's release because of how it can control those games wirelessly."
Battle of Bataan
The Battle of Bataan was part of Japan's invasion of the Philippines during World War II.
"The capture of the Philippine Islands was important to Japan's goals. Japan wanted to control the Southwest Pacific, capture the resource-rich Dutch East Indies, and protect its Southeast Asia side."
It was the largest surrender in American and Filipino military history. It was the largest United States surrender since the pre-Civil War's raid on Harper's Ferry.
Invasion.
"Japanese carrier planes attacked the United States Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor on the morning of 7 December 1941. Japanese aircraft also bombed the main bases of the American Far East Air Force near Manila, and the headquarters of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet in the Philippines. Many American planes were destroyed. The U.S. Asiatic Fleet withdrew its ships from its naval base in Cavite and retreated south. Only the submarine force was left to fight the Japanese."
"From 8 to 10 December, Japan captured airfields at Batan Island, Aparri, and Vigan City. Army Air Force B-17s attacked Japanese ships. U.S. planes damaged two Japanese transports, the flagship ""Nagato"", a destroyer and sank one minesweeper."
"The main attack was on 22 December 1941. The 14th Japanese Imperial Army attacked, led by Lieutenant General Masaharu Homma."
War Plan Orange-3.
"After capturing the beaches, the Japanese launched a major attack."
"The American commander, General Douglas MacArthur, realized that the beach defense plan had failed. On 26 December, he said that War Plan Orange-3 (WPO-3) was now being used. This was a plan to defend only Bataan and Corregidor. The plan of WPO-3 was to delay Japanese forces until the U.S. Pacific Fleet could get to the Philippines."
"Manuel L. Quezon, the president of the Philippines, his family and government staff were moved to Corregidor. MacArthur's headquarters were also moved to Corregidor."
The retreat.
Gen. MacArthur wanted to move his men to defensive positions.
"When the Japanese attacked, the untrained Philippine Army troops defending the beach were beaten. The U.S. decided to fight at Layac to slow down the Japanese troops. Later, from 1 to 5 January 1942, the U.S. fought to allow its troops to withdraw to Bataan."
WPO-3 had two defensive lines across Bataan.
The stand.
"On 9 January, Japanese forces under Lt. Gen. Susumu Morioka attacked the eastern side of the Abucay-Mauban line. They were beaten by the U.S. The Japanese advanced to the Salian River valley. U.S. troops fought off the attackers. At another battle to the west, a Japanese force got past the Abucay-Mauban line. The U.S. stopped their advance. On 15 January, 1st Regular Division was bombed, but they held the line. The Japanese moved through a gap. The Abucay-Mauban line had to be abandoned on 22 January."
"Within four days, the Orion-Bagac line was formed. The remaining Japanese troops managed to get through. General Homma ordered the stopping of all operations to reorganize his forces. On 22 February the 14th Army line was withdrawn a few miles to the north."
"Japanese troops landed on the west coast of southern Bataan on the night of 22 January. The US sunk two barges and the rest scattered into two groups. The Japanese forces were stopped by Philippine Constabulary units and U.S. Army Air Corps men fighting as infantry. Japanese commanders sent new troops to the beaches, but they could not break out."
Fall of Bataan.
"On the night of 12 March, General MacArthur, his family left Corregidor. MacArthur went to Australia. He promised the Filipino people that he ""shall return"". After the failure of their first attack against Bataan, the Japanese sent artillery forces to the Philippines. They had 190 artillery pieces, which included bigger guns like 150 mm cannons, and the Type 96 240 mm field howitzer. The Japanese sent new troops to Gen. Homma's 14th Imperial Army. Toward the end of March, the Japanese forces prepared for the final attack."

Book of Esther
"Esther is the name of a book in the Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible) and the Old Testament, and also its title heroine. It is the basis for the Jewish celebration Purim."
Author and Date.
"Although it is never said who wrote the book of Esther, from inside evidence it is possible to make some guesses about the author and when it was written. The author was a Jew, because he emphasizes where the Jewish festival came from and from the Jewish nationalism inside the story. The author probably lived in a Persian city, because he knew Persian customs well, and does not say anything about the land of Judah or Jerusalem. The earliest date of the book would be a little while after the events were told, for instance, about 460 B.C. (before Ezra's return to Jerusalem). It is also thought that the festival of Purim had been celebrated some time before this book was written."
"Purpose, Themes, and Features."
Purpose.
The author's main purpose was to write about how the yearly festival of Purim started and to make people remember the saving of the Jewish people during King Ahaseurus' reign. The book shows both the start of the festival and why it should continue to be celebrated.
Themes.
"In the book, the author repeatedly talks about the conflict between Israel and the Amalekites, a conflict that began during the exodus and continued through Israel's history. The author of Esther views them as the symbol of all the powers of the world against God's people. Now that Israel has been released from captivity, Haman's dangerous edict is the final try in the Old Testament time to get rid of them. When Haman is defeated, Israel enjoys a time of rest."
"Feasting is another important theme in Esther, as seen in the picture on the left. Banquets are the setting for important parts of the story. There are ten banquets."
Style and Features.
Repetition is one of the main stylistic features of the book of Esther. The three groups of banquets come in pairs; there are two lists of the king's servants; two reports that Esther hid her identity; two gatherings of women; two houses for the women; two fasts; two talks by Haman with his wife and friends; two sudden visits to the king by Esther; two coverings of Haman's face; two royal commands; two cool-downs of the king's anger; two days for the Jews to protect themselves and take vengeance; and two letters about how Purim started.
"Another important feature of this book that has often been wondered about is that it never directly talks about God, worship, prayer, or sacrifice. This has made some people think the book is not as religious as other books. However, it is possible that the author purposefully did not say anything about God or anything religious to show more clearly that it is God who controls all the ""unimportant"" coincidences that are in the story and ends in saving the Jews."
Content.
"The Book of Esther is about a Jewish girl adopted by her cousin, Mordecai, after her parents died."
"The Persian King Ahaseurus kicked out his wife, Queen Vashti, after she refused his demand, and fell in love with Esther at a beauty contest. He took Esther as the new Persian queen, not knowing she was a Jew."
"Haman, Ahaseurus' prime minister, developed a grudge against Mordecai because he would not bow down to him, but only to the God of Israel. He despised Mordecai because he was a Jew, and tried to trick the king into making a law to kill all Jews. Haman was unaware that Queen Esther herself was a Jew."
Tel Aviv
"The city of Tel Aviv-Yafo (;  ) is a municipality in Israel, often just called Tel Aviv. It is Israel's second largest city and main commercial, financial, industrial and cultural center. It is on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea."

"It was Israel's first capital when the nation was established in 1948. The capital was moved to Jerusalem in 1949, but the Israeli Ministry of Defense and many foreign embassies stayed in Tel Aviv. Most Israeli ministries that are located in Jerusalem, have offices in Tel Aviv. The national intelligence agencies of Israel, Mossad (external security), Aman (military intelligence) and Shin Bet (internal security) also have their headquarters in Tel Aviv."
"In 1950, Tel Aviv and Jaffa (called ""Yafo"" in Hebrew) joined to into the city of Tel Aviv-Yafo. Tel Aviv-Yafo is the official name of the city, but it is almost always called Tel Aviv."
"Tel Aviv continued to grow quickly in the 1950s and 1960s. The fast growth of the Tel Aviv area caused problems such as air pollution, slums, and traffic that took until the 2000s to fix. Traffic is still a problem. That is why the Tel Aviv Light Rail is being built to ease the road traffic. Most of the people of Tel Aviv live in apartment buildings."
"During the Persian Gulf War of 1991, Iraq fired about 25 missiles toward Tel Aviv. Several missiles and falling debris struck residential areas in or around Tel Aviv. Two people were killed, and about 7,500 apartments were damaged."

"The personality of Emoinu and other goddesses like Panthoibi and Phouoibi depict as well as influence the , courage, independence, and social honour of Meitei women."
Name.
"The meaning of the name ""Emoinu Ahongbi"" (""ꯏꯃꯣꯢꯅꯨ ꯑꯍꯣꯡꯕꯤ"") can be found by splitting it up word by word. Here, ""E"" (""ꯏ"") refers to human being. ""Moi"" (""ꯃꯣꯢ"" or ""ꯃꯣꯏ"") refers to . ""Nu"" (""ꯅꯨ"") refers to female deity or goddess. So, ""Emoinu"" means ""goddess who rears the human beings"". ""Ahongbi"" means ""giver of plentiful household properties""."

"The Meitei people believed that goddess Imoinu lives in the houses of those who strictly obey her favorite social and moral behavior norms. Imoinu blesses such people with ""nungai yaifaba"" (well being and prosperity), ""watta padaba"" (having neither shortage nor excess), ""tekta kaidaba"" (unaffected by troubles of life) and ""punshi nungshangba"" (long life). These are the basic needs of life in the human world."

She created another Leimarel. The appearance of the second Leimarel was similar to the first Leimarel. The first Leimarel named the second Leimarel as ""Emoinu Ahongbi""."
Lover.
"Once goddess Imoinu fell in love with a man. The two became lovers. They swore to be husband and wife. One day, she visited his house in his absence.

It is done in every Meitei household with the offering of little cooked rice before eating."
Modern worship.
Demonic is the seventh studio album by American heavy metal band Testament. It was released in 1997. The lyrics deal with occult themes more like their 1980s efforts instead of the political topics covered on more recent releases.
"Musically, Testament takes a slower, almost death metal oriented approach with grinding guitar riffs and Chuck Billy's vocal work consisting primarily of death growls."
"This album also marked the first time, as Testament, that the band used the old Legacy pentagram graphic."

A Child of Our Time
A Child of Our Time is an oratorio by Michael Tippett. It was composed between 1939 and 1941.
Why Tippett wrote this oratorio.
"Tippett composed this oratorio at the beginning of World War II. He had already lived through World War I and he was very upset about all the evil in this world. He wanted to write a musical work about it. He did it by taking the story of the beginning of World War II as a basis of the oratorio, but he also made the work speak in general about the evil of this world."
"In 1938 a 17 year old Jewish boy Hershel Grynspan, who lived in Paris, desperately wanted to attack the Nazis because of the cruel way his parents in Germany had been treated. He therefore murdered a Nazi diplomat in France. The Nazi’s in Germany were so furious that they attacked and murdered lots of Jews in Germany. This terrible attack became known as the ""Kristallnacht"". This series of events can be found in the words of Tippett’s oratorio. Tippett wrote the words himself."
"The title comes from Ödön von Horváth’s novel, ""Ein Kind unserer Zeit"" (A Child of Our Time), written in 1938 and published in English in 1939. Tippett began composing it on 5 September 1939, two days after Britain declared war against Germany."
"In 1958 Tippett arranged the five negro spirituals so that they could be sung by unaccompanied chorus. They are often performed like that, separately from the oratorio."
"Tippett uses a similar structure to the Passions of Bach. This meant that he used a narrator (like the evangelist in Bach’s Passions) who tells the story. Instead of Bach’s Lutheran chorales he adds five negro spirituals which add an emotional comment to the events. The music of these spirituals blend very cleverly into the style of Tippett’s music. The whole oratorio, which lasts a little over one hour, has three parts. This idea is based on the three parts of Handel's ""Messiah"". Tippett calls the three parts: 1) Prophecy; 2) Narrative; 3) Meditation."
The story in the oratorio.
Part One.
"Part one opens with a picture of the world in darkness. The alto solo shows what the person’s soul is feeling. The bass (narrator) tells of the purges in Russia, the lynching in the USA, the terrible poverty in Britain. The chorus tell of their despair."

The China Syndrome
"The China Syndrome is a disaster movie about a near-meltdown at a nuclear power plant. It was released on March 16, 1979, twelve days before the Three Mile Island accident. The term ""China syndrome"" refers to a scenario, not meant to be taken literally, where a reactor core could melt through the Earth ""all the way to China""."
Plot summary.
"News reporter Kimberly Wells (Jane Fonda) and her cameraman Richard Adams (Michael Douglas) are filming a special on nuclear power at the (fictional) Ventana Nuclear Power Plant when they witness an earthquake followed by a reactor scram. In the control room, Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) notices that the water level is high and asks another member of the crew to open a relief valve. Ted Spindler (Wilford Brimley) warns him that regulations do not permit opening the relief valve, but he proceeds to open it anyway. The control room crew then notices that the water level is actually dangerously low, and declare an emergency over the intercom ordering all personnel to safety areas. They manage to bring the water level back up to a safe level, meanwhile, Richard secretly films the incident. Richard wants to show the film on television, but the station manager will not allow it. Richard then steals the film and shows it to a group of nuclear engineers who determine that the plant came very close to the China syndrome, where the core would have melted through its containment and down into the Earth, contaminating a large area. Meanwhile, Jack Godell discovers that the welds on the main pump are not safe, and takes over the plant by force, locks himself in the control room, and demands to be interviewed on television. A SWAT team is called in, and proceeds to break into the control room. The other members of the control room crew cut wires in other areas of the plant to intentionally cause a scram. When the scram begins, the main pump fails, and Jack Godell is shot by the SWAT team."
Response of the nuclear power industry.
"Upon its release, the movie was criticized by the nuclear power industry, referring to the movie as ""sheer fiction"" and a ""character assassination of an entire industry"". Twelve days after the movie was released, however, the Three Mile Island accident occurred in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. Both the accident depicted in the movie and the real-world accident at Three Mile Island involved loss of water through a relief valve, as well as the control room crew incorrectly reading water levels."

Skagerrak
Skagerrak is a sea in the northern part of Europe between Norway and Denmark. Skagerrak is a part of the North Sea. To the east is Kattegat.
"Close to the Norwegian coast is a deep trench (700 m), the rest of the sea is shallow. Oil and gas are produced from rigs in the Skagerrak."
Kattegat
"Kattegat is a sea in the northern part of Europe between the Danish peninsula Jutland, the Danish island Zealand, and the western coast of Sweden."
To the north-west is Skagerrak. Kattegat is connected to the Baltic Sea through the Danish Straits and Belts.
"The sea is shallow, and life conditions are threatened by loss of oxygen in the water. The oxygen loss is caused by pollution. The pollution originates from farming. A century ago, the sea was very rich in cod, herring, and salmon, which were important sources of food in the countries around the sea."
Baltic Sea
"The Baltic Sea is a sea in northern Europe between Scandinavia, Finland, Russia, the Baltic countries, Poland, and Germany."
"Many big rivers in the surrounding countries drain into the Baltic Sea. The Baltic Sea is connected to the ocean through the narrow and shallow Danish straits and belts. For this reason, the water has a low amount of salt, so the northern parts of the sea freeze over in the winter. The ice can carry cars, and roads are established every winter between the islands in the archipelagos between Sweden and Finland."
"For several thousand years, the Baltic Sea has connected the countries at her shores. For that reason there are many cultural similarities in these countries. Since all of these countries are European, this sea is also considered European."
Scandinavia
"Scandinavia is a group of countries in northern Europe. Scandinavia is also the smallest region in Europe. Scandinavia has Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Some people also think Finland is part of Scandinavia. Others also say Iceland and the Faroe Islands should count. Most of the time, ""Scandinavia"" is used to mean places where people speak Scandinavian languages, also called North Germanic languages or Nordic. The Scandinavian languages (Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Icelandic, and Faroese) are very similar to each other, and many Scandinavians understand parts of the other languages because they are alike in some ways. Finnish is not part of the North Germanic language group."
"What people mean when they say ""Scandinavia"" depends on what they think is important at the time. When people want to talk about about maps, natural land formations and how the economy works, they may say Finland is part of Scandinavia but Iceland is not. When people want to talk about history and what languages people speak, they say Iceland is part of Scandinavia but Finland is not."
"The Scandinavian Peninsula is a large peninsula reaching west from northern Europe over the north side of the Baltic Sea. Norway, Sweden and some of Finland are on this peninsula. However, Denmark is considered part of Scandinavia in the ethnic sense more often than Finland is. This is because Danish is a Scandinavian language but Finnish is not."
"Some people like to say ""Nordic countries"" instead of ""Scandinavia"" because they think it is more correct about geography. The Nordic countries include Norway, Sweden, Denmark (including the Faroe Islands), Finland, and Iceland. These five countries use the Nordic Council to work together on political and cultural activities. Denmark, Sweden, and Finland are also members of the European Union, but only Finland is part of the eurozone, meaning that it uses the Euro as its money. The other Nordic countries still use their own money, called ""krone"" or ""krona"" (from the word ""crowns""). Norway and Iceland, which are not members of the EU, are members of NATO and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Only Denmark is a member of both the EU and NATO."
Geography.
"Most of the Scandinavian Peninsula has only a few people in it. It has large forests of pine, birch, and spruce trees. The western and northern parts are mountainous; the Scandinavian mountains are some of the oldest in the world. The tallest mountain is Galdhøpiggen in Norway. Denmark (43,098 km2) is the smallest of the Scandinavian countries. It is more densely populated, and most of the land is farmland. Sweden (449,964 km2) is the largest of the Scandinavian countries. It has the most lakes, and the landscape ranges from plains in the south to mountains in the west (along the border with Norway) to tundra in the north. The far north of Scandinavia and Finland is called Lapland, where the Sami people live. Some of them still herd reindeer, but most Sami live in modern houses and have modern jobs, like other Scandinavians."
Vikings.
"The most famous group of Scandinavians is the Vikings of the Middle Ages. The Vikings attacked and raided but they were also traders, traveling to the Ukraine and starting trade routes to the Middle East."
"Vikings from Norway were explorers, crossing the North Atlantic in their longships. They came to Iceland and Greenland and built towns and farms there. The Norwegian explorers also came to the east coast of Canada, where they set up at least one settlement, but it did not last into modern times."
"The Vikings from Denmark came to England, where they affected the history and politics and even the English language. Danish raiders attacked England many times with great violence. Sometimes the Danes would ask that the English pay them to go away. These payments were called ""Danegeld"" (Danish gold). The priests and bishops of churches on the east coast of England wrote a famous prayer: ""deliver us, O Lord, from the wrath of the Norsemen!"" ""Norsemen"" is another way to say ""men from the north,"" or the Danes."
Scandinavians in fiction and theater.
Vichy France
"The Vichy France or the French State was the nominal government of all of France except for Alsace-Lorraine. It also governed the French colonial empire. It was led by Philippe Pétain, notable for helping to win World War I. When the French and British armies lost the Battle of Dunkirk and the rest of the Battle of France was being lost, the French Parliament made him Prime Minister. He negotiated an armistice with the Germans, agreeing to be neutral in World War II. Pétain became Head of State, effectively dictator, and usually did what the Germans told him to do."
"The Axis powers militarily occupied northern France and part of the southeast. The Vichy government, as a client state of Germany, controlled the ""Free Zone"" or unoccupied parts of France until November1942. The German army ran the Northern half. In 1944, the Vichy government, now effectively a puppet state, moved to Nazi Germany, and later disbanded. It became known as Vichy France after World War II."
Anguilla
Anguilla is a group of five islands in the Caribbean Sea. The islands are ruled by the United Kingdom.
"Anguilla was colonized by the British Empire and used to be part of what is now Saint Kitts and Nevis, but broke away in 1980 so it could stay part of Great Britain. Saint Kitts and Nevis wanted to be independent."
"It is named after the Spanish word for ""eel"", because it has such a shape."
Anguilla was first settled by Arawakan-speaking Indians who called it Malliouhana.
Politics.
"The King or Queen of the United Kingdom is the ruler of Anguilla, but she works through a governor. He or she names, or ""appoints"" the governor, and he is just working there in place of the monarch. The legislature is elected by the people, has 11 members, and is called the House of Assembly."
Economy.
"Anguilla has mostly been part of the British Empire since the 17th century. The British brought thousands of slaves from Africa and forced them to work, like they did all over the Caribbean and North America. Many of the slaves decided to run away rather than be forced to work. When the British decided to abolish slavery they paid all the slave owners a lot of money, but didn't give anything to the slaves. Now Anguilla gets most of its money from fishing and tourism."
Culture.
"Most people in Anguilla are Protestants, and speak English."
Bermuda
"Bermuda (/bɜrˈmjuːdə/ ""Ber-myu-dah""; officially, the Bermudas or Somers Islands) is a British overseas territory in the North Atlantic Ocean. The land has one main island and 180 smaller islands. Bermuda is a popular tourist place, with mild weather during the winter months."
"Off the east coast of the United States, Bermuda's nearest landmass is Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, about 1,030 kilometres (640 mi) to the west-northwest. It is about 1,373 kilometres (853 mi) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, and 1,770 kilometres (1,100 mi) northeast of Miami, Florida. Its capital city is Hamilton."
History.
"in 1505 by Spanish navigator Juan de Bermúdez (who said it to be inhabited only with pigs), after whom the islands are named. Bermúdez claimed it for the Spanish Empire. Unoccupied, the island was settled by England in 1609, making it the oldest and most populous remaining British overseas territory. Its first capital, St George's, was founded in 1612 and is the oldest continuously inhabited English town in the Americas."
Geography.
"The country is in the Atlantic Ocean, near the western edge of the Sargasso Sea. It is about 580 nautical miles (1070 km, 670 mi) east-southeast of Cape Hatteras on the Outer Banks of North Carolina and about 590 nautical miles (1100 km, 690 mi) southeast of Martha's Vineyard. The island is due east of Fripp Island, South Carolina. It has 103 km (64 mi) of coastline."
"The territory has 181 islands. The total area is 53.3 square kilometres (20.6 sq mi). The largest island is ""Main Island"", sometimes itself called ""Bermuda""."
Climate.
"Bermuda has a subtropical climate. The weather is humid and, as a result, the summertime heat index can be high, even though mid-August temperatures rarely exceed Winters are mild, with average daytime temperatures in January and February around The temperature rarely drops below 10 °C"
Bermuda is very likely to be affected by hurricanes. The island's small size means that direct landfalls are rare. The last hurricane to cause significant damage to Bermuda was category 3 Hurricane Fabian on 5 September 2003.
The only source of fresh water in Bermuda is rainfall. It is collected on roofs and catchments and stored in tanks. Each home usually has at least one of these tanks forming part of its foundation.
Flora and fauna.
"When discovered, Bermuda had no people. It was mostly covered by forests of Bermuda cedar, with mangrove marshes along its shores. Only 165 of the island's current 1000 vascular plant species are considered native. Of those 15, including the cedar, are endemic."
"Many species of palm trees have been introduced to Bermuda. Coconut palms grow there, making it the furthest north place for the natural growth of this species. While coconuts grow on Bermuda, the lack of heat does not usually let them properly set fruit."
"The only indigenous mammals of Bermuda are five species of bats. All of these bats are also in the eastern United States — ""Lasionycteris noctivagans"", ""Lasiurus borealis"", ""Lasiurus cinereus"", ""Lasiurus seminolus"" and ""Perimyotis subflavus"". Other commonly known fauna of Bermuda includes its national bird, the Bermuda Petrel, and the Bermuda Rock Skink. The skink was long thought to have been the only indigenous land vertebrate of Bermuda. It has recently been discovered, however, that a species of terrapin predated the arrival of humans on the archipelago."
"Theism is the religious belief that at least one god exists while rejecting the existence or importance of polytheistic gods or goddesses. In a broader definition it can also be the belief in God or gods in general, including all types of god-belief. Polytheism is the belief in several gods, while monotheism is the belief in just one god. For example, a theistic religion is Christianity. The opposite to a theist is an atheist. An atheist is a person who denies or disbelieves the existence of a supreme being or beings."
Different theisms.
All of these are rough definitions of the theisms; they are almost always different. We can split them all into different groups:
"Gnosticism and agnosticism can be combined with other forms of theism. For example, it is possible to be an agnostic atheist, or a gnostic theist. In common usage, some people group atheism and agnosticism together under the group of nontheism — absence of clear belief in any deity."
The main types of theism are:
"This is another way to group different theisms, based on the nature of the gods."
There are also these types:
Plesiosaur
"The plesiosaurs were an order of large, carnivorous marine reptiles. They flourished from 245 million years ago (mya) to 65 mya."
"In 1719, William Stukeley described the first partial skeleton of a plesiosaur. The great-grandfather of Charles Darwin, Robert Darwin of Elston told him about it."
"Mary Anning was the first to discover a fairly complete plesiosaur. She found it on the 'Jurassic Coast' of Dorset, England in the winter of 1820/21. The fossil was missing its skull, but in 1823 she found another one, this time complete with its skull. The name ""Plesiosaurus"" was given to it by the Rev. William Conybeare."
"The earliest plesiosaur remains are from the Middle Triassic period,p128 and the group was important through the Jurassic and Cretaceous. They had two large pairs of paddles, short tails, short or long necks, and broad bodies. They died out at the K/T extinction event, 65 million years ago."
Description.
"Plesiosaurs had many bones in their flippers, making them flexible. No modern animal has this four-paddle anatomy: modern turtles use their forelimbs for swimming. They were mainly piscivorous (fish-eaters)."
Pliosaurs.
"The pliosaurs were a group of mostly large submarine predators with short necks and large heads. Their sizes ranged from two to 15 metres, and they were predators of large fish and other reptiles. Their streamlined body shape suggests they swam and ate under water."
Long-necked plesiosaurs.
"There were three families of long-necked plesiosaurs, who evidently had a different life-style from the pliosaurs. It was suggested by D.M.S. Watson that their method was as surface swimmers, darting down to snatch smaller fish which were feeding on plankton. It is hard to see the benefit of a long neck under water; aquatic mammals operating under water all have a streamlined torpedo-shape, as did pliosaurs and ichthyosaurs. All the longer-necked familiers were, from the setting of the teeth and jaws, eaters of small fish. However, some at least were bottom-feeders, consuming various prey. Digestion of shellfish was aided by gastroliths."
Gastroliths.
"Plesiosaurs have been found with fossils of belemnites (squid-like animals), and ammonites (giant nautilus-like molluscs) associated with their stomachs. But plesiosaurs could not crack shells. Instead, they probably swallowed them whole. In the belly of a plesiosaur were ""stomach stones"", which are called ""gastroliths."" These stones moved around in the plesiosaur's stomach and cracked or crushed the shells of the animals it ate. One plesiosaur fossil found in South Dakota had 253 gatroliths weighing a total of 29 pounds."
Live birth?
"Live birth has been proved for ichthyosaurs, but is uncertain for plesiosaurs."
"Midland, Texas"
"Midland is a city in the American state of Texas. It is called Midland, because it is the midway point between two bigger cities in Texas, Fort Worth and El Paso. Oil was discovered in the region in 1923 and is still a larger part of the economy."
"Midland is also famous as the hometown of former First Lady Barbara Walker Bush. She and her husband, former president George H. W. Bush lived there, with their children including the later US President George W. Bush and his wife Laura, and his brother Jeb Bush, the former Governor of Florida."
Sardinia
"Sardinia (, Sardinian: ""Sardigna"") is the second largest island in the Mediterranean Sea. It is an autonomous region of Italy. It was formerly the Kingdom of Sardinia."
"The official name is, in Italian, Regione Autonoma della Sardegna.The capital and largest city is Cagliari."
Geography.
The lotus flowers grow over the water. Lotus leaves often float on top of the water. The roots of lotus plants are in the mud (wet dirt) under the water. Every part of every plant must have air for respiration (breathing). Air spaces in the stems and roots make the lotus able to live and respire under water.
People can eat lotus roots and seeds. Cattle (cows) like to eat the leaves and flowers.
"Lotuses look rather like water lilies from the Nymphaeaceae family. It is the ""National flower"" of both India and Vietnam and also the ""Provincial flower"" of Sindh province, Pakistan."
Nymphaeaceae
"In botany, Nymphaeaceae is the name of a family of plants which grow in water. The family is also called ""water-lily family""."
Their flowers suggest they are one of the earliest groups of angiosperms. Modern genetic analyses by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group researchers has confirmed its basal position among flowering plants.
"Also, the Nymphaeaceae are more diverse and wdespread than other basal angiosperms. Nymphaeaceae is in the order Nymphaeales. According to the most widely accepted flowering plant classification system, this is the second diverging group of angiosperms after ""Amborella""."
Ugly Betty
"Ugly Betty is a Golden Globe- and Peabody Award-winning American comedy-drama television series. It stars America Ferrera, Vanessa Williams, and Eric Mabius. It premiered on September 28, 2006, on ABC in the United States. The series follows the life of Betty Suarez (Ferrera), and her incongruous job at the ultra-chic New York City fashion magazine ""Mode"". Betty's status as a ""fish out of water"" drives much of the plot. Ugly Betty ended on April 14, 2010 after low ratings during season 4."

"Since the show's debut, the main characters have become the latest fixures in the lexicon of pop media culture. They have already had parodies, news media stories and art-imitating-life situations, as well as recognition from the United States Congress itself."
Shinto shrine
"A Shinto shrine is a sacred place or site where people worship in the Shinto religion. Many Shinto shrines have buildings, gates, and natural areas such as forests and rivers around them. The usual Japanese word for a Shinto shrine is ."
Miko
"are women in the service of Shinto shrines. The translation of ""Miko"" is ""Woman of God"" (chosen by, or totally devoted to, the gods), but the closest meaning is ""shrine maiden"". In Shinto, there are priestesses; but Miko are not priestesses, because they have less authority. However, they can act as priestesses if needed. They usually help Shintoist priests."
Mineko Iwasaki
", born Masako Tanaka on November 2, 1949 in Kyoto, was Japan's number one ""geiko"" (geisha) until she retired at the age of 29. She entertained many important people when they visited Japan, like Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles. She retired because she was tired of the profession, and wanted to start a family."
"Author Arthur Golden did an interview to her and used her as inspiration for his book ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", that was later made a movie. Iwasaki later said that the book was full of lies, and that nothing that Golden said ever happened to her. She put a lawsuit against Golden for this, and they solved it out of court in 2003. After the publication of ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", Iwasaki wrote her autobiography, ""Geisha, A Life""."

"Hare Krishna is a mantra. It is also known as Maha Mantra. The mantra was made well known even outside Hinduism by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. The mantra can be found in many Hinduist traditions in India. Those who believe in it think that when the mantra is heard, spoken, used for meditation or sung this can lead to a higher state of consciousness. According to Gaudiya Vaishnava theology, this higher consciousness takes the form of pure love of God (Krishna). The mantra is contained in the texts of Hinduism known as the Upanishads, which are considered by some scholars to have roots in the Vedic past."

Election history.
Phouoibi Waron
"The Phouoibi Waron () or the Phouoibi Warol () is an old Meitei text (PuYa) written in a period between 13th and 14th century AD. It deals with the life story of the lovers of Phouoibi, the goddess of agricultural crops and harvest in Meitei mythology and religion (Sanamahism)."
The story in the text is a very usual product of the agriculture of Ancient Manipur (Antique Kangleipak). Phouoibi is believed to be very fickle in love. She has multiple lovers. Her lovers are generally mortals. She doesn't live with anyone of them forever. She travels from place to place and makes love with many mortals. But she leaves them after some time. She lives with some of her favourite lovers for some time but she leaves them too. The nature of the goddess of agricultural crops and harvest is imagined to be fickle or tricky. This symbolises that wealth isn't a permanent property. It doesn't last long to a certain place. Devastations due to battles and natural disasters were common in ancient times. It is the reason why the paddy goddess was considered to be very irregular in bestowing her favor to the mankind.
"The Phouoibi Waron and many other PuYas reveal much about the Meitei rites and rituals of ancient times. These rites and rituals are still widely practiced by the maibas, maibis and others."

Franz Magill
"Franz Hermann Anton Magill (August 22, 1900 – April 14, 1972) was a German riding instructor, SS officer and war criminal of the Nazi era."
Background.
"Franz Magill was the son of a day laborer. His father bought a small farm in Zuchen in 1908, where Magill graduated from elementary school. He was called up at the end of the First World War and after the end of the war in 1919 he became a volunteer (twelve donors) in the Hussar Regiment No. 5 of the Reichswehr. In 1923 he was promoted to sergeant, in 1928 to sergeant. In 1929 he passed the riding instructor examination at the riding school in Belgard and, after leaving the Reichswehr, went to the private ""German riding school"" at Gut Düppel in Berlin as a qualified riding instructor."
"After the National Socialists took power in 1933, Magill joined the SS and directed the riding instruction of an SS Reitersturms. In March 1935 he became a full-time SS leader riding instructor at the SS Junker School in Braunschweig and made a career there. At the end of 1935 he was promoted to SS-Hauptsturmführer and, after he joined the NSDAP in 1937 (membership number 4.137.171), to SS-Sturmbannführer on April 20, 1938."
"Shortly after the attack on Poland, Magill received the order to set up SS cavalry squadrons in Gut Düppel and, in September 1939, in Lodsch in occupied Poland, then two months later in the Lublin district. There, the basis of the SS skull rider standards (two regiments) formed. In May 1940, Magill received an order from Hermann Fegelein to set up the 2nd SS-Totenkopf-Reiterstandard. Magill was not up to the task. In April 1941 he was recalled as leader of the 2nd regiment and commander of a cavalry division with four squadrons.The regimental leader of the 1st regiment was Hermann Fegelein and the 2nd regiment SS-Sturmbannführer was Heimo Hierthes (1897-1951). In the 1st regiment, Magill's position was held by SS-Sturmbannführer Gustav Lombard."

Theories as to the origin of the name include:
"A map (""Leyland map"") dated from around 1640 gives a Latin name ""Casus Rupes"" (broken rocks), which would seem to confirm the third theory above, but which may be a folk etymology."
History.
Wrecks.
"There have been numerous wrecks on the islets; fierce tides reaching 6-7 knots on springs and a lack of landmarks account for many wrecks in the area. The most famous include SS ""Stella"", wrecked in 1899. The largest wreck was the 8000 tonne water tanker ""Constantia S""."
"It was believed for centuries that HMS ""Victory"" was wrecked in 1744 on the Casquets, the lightkeeper of Alderney even being court-martialled for failure to keep the light on at the time of the ship's loss. However, when the wreck of that ship was found in 2008, it was over 60 nautical miles (110 km) from the Casquets."
Casquets lighthouses.
"The first lighthouses started operation on 30 October 1724, and were three towers lit by coal fires called St Peter, St Thomas and the Dungeon. Three stone towers were built so the lights would not look like those in nearby France."
"They were built by Thomas Le Cocq, owner of the rocks, under licence from Trinity House and who was paid a halfpenny per ton of ship when vessels passed the rocks and in turn he paid Trinity House 50 pounds per year for the right to run the lighthouses. The lighthouses reverted to Trinity House in 1785."
They were converted to oil lamps with metal reflectors which were first used on 25 November 1790; and upgraded again with apparatus to rotate a beam of light in 1818. This had a clockwork mechanism which was wound up every hour and a half and gave one flash every 15 seconds.
"The lighthouses were badly damaged and the lanterns smashed in a severe storm on 31 October 1823. The towers were raised by a further 10 yards (9.1 m) in 1854, and 184 kilocandela lamps were added which gave three slow flashes every half minute. In 1877 the North West Tower was raised again and the lights in the other two towers turned off."
"British commandos of the Small Scale Raiding Force made two raids during the Second World War on the lighthouse, following the German occupation of the Channel Islands in 1940. The first raid, Operation Dryad, took place on 2/3 September 1942 and the seven keepers were taken back to England as prisoners of war."
"In 1954 the lighthouse was coverted to electricity and a 2,830 kilocandela lamp was put in. The lamp is unusual because it rotates anti-clockwise. At the same time, the other two towers were reduced in height."
"The current light in the 23 metres (75 ft) North West Tower is 37 metres (121 ft) above mean sea level and flashes five times every 30 seconds and with flashes 3.7 seconds apart. It can be seen for around 24 nautical miles (44 km) in clear weather. The East Tower contains the foghorn, which produces two blasts every 60 seconds and this has a nominal range of 3 nautical miles (5.6 km). The South West Tower is topped with a helipad and there is another helipad on a flat section of the rock. The rocks are also marked using racon with a Morse letter T on radar displays. The lighthouse complex was automated in 1990 and is monitored and controlled from the Trinity House Operations Control Centre in Harwich."
Maria Francisca of Savoy
Maria Francisca of Savoy (Marie Françoise Élisabeth; 21 June 1646 – 27 December 1683) was a Princess of Savoy and the Queen consort of Portugal twice as the wife of Afonso VI and his brother Peter II.
Biography.
"The younger daughter of Charles Amadeus, Duke of Nemours, and Élisabeth de Bourbon she was the younger sister of Marie Jeanne, Duchess of Savoy who married Victor Amadeus II in 1666. She was baptised with the names Marie Françoise Élisabeth, but was known as ""Marie Françoise""."
"Born a princess of Savoy, her immediate family had resided in France since the previous century. Styled ""Mademoiselle d'Aumale"" she was engaged to Afonso VI of Portugal by order of Louis XIV who wanted an alliance with Portugal against Spain. As such, the young queen left Paris on 29 May 1666, with the Marquis of Sande and his entourage, heading to La Rochelle. On 27 June there was a proxy ceremony where Afonso VI was represented by Sande. She bought a dowry of 1.8 Million pounds as part of an agreement which was signed on 24 February 1666. She arrived had her marriage in person on 2 August 1666. Her husband was pleased at his attractive wife. Her husband was paralysed on his left side and mentally unstable.

Monkwearmouth–Jarrow Abbey
"Monkwearmouth–Jarrow was a combination of two English monasteries run as a single community. Both were founded by Benedict Biscop. Monkwearmouth, built first, was a magnificent example of the Roman style of architecture. It housed one of the first stained glass works in England. Jarrow became the center of Anglo-Saxon learning in the north of England and contained the largest library in Anglo-Saxon England. Bede, the great Anglo-Saxon scholar, studied, taught and wrote there. The sister Anglo-Saxon monasteries were the UK nomination for World Heritage Site status in 2011."
History.
"In 674 Benedict Biscop, a Northumbrian nobleman, built a monastery known as Monkwearmouth. Egfrith, King of Northumbria gave him fifty hides of land at the mouth of the River Wear. This monastery would be dedicated to Saint Peter and came to be called St. Peter's at Monkwearmouth. Benedict wanted his monastery to be a center of both learning and religion. Benedict used Frankish stonemasons who he brought over to England to construct the monastery. Monkwearmouth was the first (and Jarrow the second) church structures to be built of stone in England. Benedict them brought over glassmakers from Frankia to fit the windows of the church and chapels with fine stained glass. They established a workshop there at Monkwearwolf. Within a year the monastery was completed. In 678 a letter from Pope Agatho exempted the monastery from external control. Benedict got all the , sacred vessels, decorations and . Some he found locally while others he bought in Francia and Rome. In 682 King Egfrith gave another forty hides of land to Benedict for a second monastery. It was to be at the mouth of the River Trent at Jarrow. The dedication ceremony for Jarrow abbey was held on 23 April 685. Named for Saint Paul when the sister monastery was completed Benedict assigned Ceolfrith to the abbot. Bede, who was about ten years old at the time, was one of the monks who went with him. King Egfrid, who was at the dedication, died in battle against the Picts less than a month later. The two sister abbeys, only seven miles apart, were thought of as one."
"The library that Benedict started made it possible for Bede to write his works including his famous ""Ecclesiastical History of the English People"".information from. There wasn't another library like it in England. By the time of his death in 689 Benedict had completed four trips to Rome and the south and brought back large collections of books each time. The full extent of Bede's work would still not be possible if not for Ceolfrid, the fourth abbot. He doubled the size of the library left by Benedict Biscop."
"The at Monkwearmouth-Jarrow was kept very busy. There was a growing demand for copies of bibles, books, documents and especially the works of Bede. Requests came in from other parts of England and the . Works from the scriptorium would be found in Leningrad, Rome, and other parts of Europe. Under increasing requests for its products, the Monkwearmouth-Jarrow scriptorium adopted a faster script style used in later works."
"In 794, just a year after the Vikings sacked Lindisfarne, the Vikings attacked Monkwearmouth and Jarrow. The flames were so hot the glass was melted. Both sites were abandoned for a time. Their location on the coast of Northumbria made them easy targets for Viking raids. The twin monasteries were rebuilt. Unlike many old ruins that disappear over time, the old walls of Monkwearmouth and Jarrow can still be seen. They are next to or part of the modern buildings that replaced the original buildings built in 674 and 682."

"In South Indian cuisine, especially Tamil cuisine, citron is widely used in pickles and preserves. In Tamil, the unripe fruit is referred to as 'narthangai', which is usually salted and dried to make a preserve. The tender leaves of the plant are often used in conjunction with chili powder and other spices to make a powder, called 'narthellai podi', literally translating to 'powder of citron leaves'. Both narthangai and narthellai podi are usually consumed with 'thayir sadam' (Curd Rice - Yogurt Rice)."
"In Korea, it is used to create a syrupy tea (called Yuja cha) where the slices of whole fruit are eaten with the sweet tea. The fruit is thinly sliced (peel, pith and pulp) and soaked or cooked in honey or sugar to create a chunky syrup. This syrupy candied fruit is mixed with hot water as a fragrant tea, where the fruit at the bottom of the cup is eaten as well. Often perserved in the syrup for the cold months, Yuja tea served as a source of fruit in winter. It is also popular in Taiwan, where it is known as 柚子茶 (Youzi cha)."
[Note: The Korean Yuja is the same as the Japanese Yuzu 柚子 and must be different from the citron being described in this article. The Japanese Yuzu = Citrus junos.]
Citric acid
"Citric acid is a weak organic acid. It can be found in citrus fruits ( like oranges). It is used by organisms for Krebs cycle. It acts like a preservative when added to food. It is also used to add a sour (acidic) taste to foods and soft drinks. In the European Union it is known as E 330, as a food additive."
"Carl Wilhelm Scheele was the first who could extract citric acid from lemons, in 1782. The substance was probably known to alchemists, perhaps with a different name. The Arabian alchemist Geber is said to have discovered citric acid in the 9th century. Citric Acid contains 6 Carbon atoms, 8 Hydrogen atoms and 7 Oxygen atoms. Its chemical formula is C6H8O7."
Geber
"Jābir ibn Ḥayyān (; ; died between 806 and 816), is the name for the writer of a great number of writings in Arabic. The writings together have the name Jabirian corpus. The most important subjects of these writings are: alchemy, cosmology, numerology, astrology, medicine, magic, mysticism, and philosophy."
"Jabir's writings have in them the oldest known list of chemical substances. For the first time, the writings gave an explanation of how to produce an inorganic substance (ammonium chloride) from organic substances (such as plants, blood, and hair)."
"Modern scholars doubt the historical existence of Jabir. It is probable that one person did not write all of the writings in the Jabirian corpus. Instead, scholars see Jabir ibn Hayyan as a pseudonym that a group of writers used."
"Translations into Latin of some of Jabir's Arabic writings (like the ""Book of Mercy"", and the ""Book of Seventy"") came into existence in the Middle Ages. In Latin, Jabir had the name ""Geber"", a transliteration of ""Jabir""."
"In 13th-century Europe an anonymous writer, called pseudo-Geber, started to produce new writings about alchemy under the name Geber. People still read the in the 17th century. The """" was one of the writings that pseudo-Geber produced in the 13th century. It was an influence on early modern chemists like Robert Boyle (1627–1691)."
Carl Wilhelm Scheele
"Carl Wilhelm Scheele (December 9, 1742 - May 21, 1786) a German-Swedish pharmaceutical chemist, born in Stralsund, Western Pomerania, Germany (at the time under Swedish rule), was the discoverer of many chemical substances, most notably discovering oxygen before Joseph Priestley and chlorine before Humphry Davy."

Anna died in 1759. Catherine and Peter had a very difficult relationship. When Peter died, Catherine was left to rule Russia on her own. Catherine had many lovers, probably because of the difficult marriage; over twenty lovers are known. A few of these seem to be more important:"

Hiccups
"A hiccup (also spelled hiccough) is sudden tightening of the diaphragm, which is a muscle inside the chest and below the lungs that causes air to be pulled in. A short time after diaphragm contracts, the throat suddenly closes. This closing stops the air from flowing in, and results in the ""hic"" sound that gives ""hiccups"" its name. A hiccup is a reflex, a kind of action happens in the body without trying. Hiccups often repeat several times per minute, and end on their own after a few minutes."
"Sometimes a single hiccup happens, or they may happen over and over, a few times each minute, in a series called a ""bout"" of hiccups. Hiccups are rhythmic: the time between one hiccup and the next usually doesn't change much. A bout of hiccups generally ends by itself, without having to doing anything to end it on purpose. Many home remedies (cures) are often tried to attempt to shorten how long the hiccups last, because hiccups can be uncomfortable and make it hard to pay attention to other things. It is rare that medical help is necessary because it is rare that they last long enough to cause any harm."
"Hiccups may be triggered (started) by several common human conditions such as swallowing air, eating very quickly, and laughing for a long time. They can also be caused by some drugs and by some diseases."
The reason that people hiccup is not known for sure. A leading theory (idea) is that hiccups evolved to help human babies and other young mammals obtain milk more easily during breast feeding. This is related to the pattern that hiccups often happen when a bubble of air forms below the diaphragm and takes up space in the belly.
Napoleonic era
"The Napoléonic era was a time in the history of France and Europe. This era existed during the fourth and final stage of the French Revolution. It is the time when Napoleon ruled France. The Napoleonic era begins when Napoléon Bonaparte began to rule by overthrowing the government of France which was then called the Directory, creating the French Consulate. The era ends with Hundred Days and his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo (November 9, 1799 - June 28, 1815). Afterwards, the Congress of Vienna tried to bring Europe back to pre-French Revolution days."
It was a time of many wars in Europe.
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia

VIPoma
"There are many reasons why alcoholism is more common in some areas than others. Some of these reasons include religion, culture, laws, and people's attitudes about drinking. For example, on average, people in Northern Africa, the Middle East, and islands in the Indian Ocean drink less than people anywhere else in the world.p.4 These are areas where many people are Muslims. Many Muslims in these areas do not drink any alcohol, because the Koran says not to.p.4 In some of these countries, drinking alcohol is illegal."
"However, in other areas, like Western Europe, alcohol is a part of daily life. It is legal and easy to get. People very commonly drink alcohol with meals. Very few people drink no alcohol. People's attitudes about alcohol are very different than attitudes in mostly Muslim countries. This is an example of how differences in religion, culture, laws, and attitudes about drinking can affect the amount of alcohol use and alcoholism in different areas."
Men and women.
"Alcoholism is more common in men than in women. However, in the past few decades, the number of female alcoholics has increased."
"Female alcoholics are most common in the Americas and Europe. In the United States and Western Europe, five to ten percent of women will become alcoholics at some point in their lives."
"In the Southeast Asian and Western Pacific areas, less than 1% of women are alcoholics. In Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean area, almost no women are alcoholics.p.21"
Young people.
"In many countries, young people are using more and more alcohol. In a 2008 WHO survey, underage drinking had increased in 71% of countries. Drinking by young adults (ages 18-25) had increased in 80% of countries.p.10"
Treatment options.
Alcoholism can be treated. There are many forms of treatment for alcoholism.
Detoxification.
"Detoxification (detox) is often the first step in treating alcoholism. ""Detoxification"" means ""getting toxins out of the body."" Alcohol detoxification means that the alcoholic stops drinking, so that alcohol (a toxin) can get out of their body. The alcoholic also needs to give their body time to recover from not having alcohol any more."
"It is not safe for an alcoholic to suddenly stop drinking on their own. The safest way to stop drinking is to go to a hospital that specializes in alcohol detoxification. These hospitals are often called ""detoxes"" or ""rehabs."" These places can make sure that an alcoholic has a safe detox. They can also give medications to make the alcoholic more comfortable, and to prevent symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. The most common medications that doctors give during alcohol detox are benzodiazepines.p.35"
"Once a person stops drinking alcohol, they are called ""sober"". Most people need other treatments to help them stay sober."
"Detox can be an intense process, and some people experience very strong emotions during it. This is complicated by the fact that, in the past, they may have used drugs or alcohol to help them handle strong emotions. In detox, the therapist helps them manage their emotions."
Therapy.
"Psychotherapy and group therapy can help alcoholics stay sober. For example, they can help alcoholics learn how to:"
Medications.
Some medications can help alcoholics stay sober. These medications include:pp.130-144
Vitamins.
"Many alcoholics do not have enough vitamins in their body. This can cause serious problems. For example, if an alcoholic does not have enough thiamine, they can get brain damage. Often, alcoholics are treated with thiamine to prevent brain damage. They may also be given other vitamins if needed.p.144"
Groups for alcoholics.
"Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is the biggest support and mutual aid group for alcoholics in the world. This means that in AA groups, alcoholics come together to support each other and help each other recover. AA uses a twelve-step program.

His era name as Qing emperor, ""Xuantong"", means ""proclamation of unity"". On February 12, 1912, during the Xinhai Revolution, he was forced to abdicate. He later became the ruler of the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo during World War II. He married five times but never had any children. His father was Zaifeng Prince Chun II. He never knew his mother and was raised by eunuchs."
"When he was two years old, in 1908, he became the Xuantong Emperor (then spelled as Hsuan Tung Emperor). At the age of six, he was overthrown by Sun Yat-sen in the 1911 Revolution. He was forced to give up all political power, but he was allowed to keep his title, his servants, and everything he owned in the Forbidden City. In turn, he had to pay the Republic of China 4 million taels a year and was never allowed to leave the Forbidden City."
"In 1919, Pu-yi appointed a British tutor named Reginald Johnston. It was through him that the young emperor developed a fascination with the Western world, so he began to adopt aspects of the West for himself. He learned how to ride a bicycle, he cut off his own Manchu queue, he even began to wear glasses."
"After Pu-yi was married to his first wife, he discovered that many of the palace's treasures were getting stolen. Believing that it was his eunuchs who were stealing his treasures, he demanded that they make an inventory to stop the treasury from getting robbed. On the June 27, 1923, a fire destroyed the area around the Palace of Established Happiness. He accused the eunuchs of burning the treasury to destroy any proof of their theft. He also overheard some eunuchs' conversation that made him fear for his life. In response, he banished all the eunuchs from the palace."
"In 1925, warlord Feng Yuxiang forced the emperor to leave the Forbidden City. Pu-yi then asked his tutor Johnston to go to the British embassy and ask them to let the emperor to move to England. Unfortunately, the embassy refused his request. He then called the Japanese embassy and they agreed to escort him out of Beijing and move him to Tianjin. After the Japanese took over Manchuria in 1932, they made Pu-yi the Emperor of their new puppet state, Manchukuo. Despite being emperor, he practically had no power, but he was constantly manipulated, threatened, and blackmailed by the Japanese government. Once again, the emperor found himself to be a prisoner in his own palace. Chinese media and writers accused the Japanese and collaborators like Puyi of being homosexuals as an insult."
"After the Soviet Red Army invaded Manchuria in 1945, they captured Pu-yi when they invaded Changchun. After the CCP took over China in 1949, the Soviets agreed to hand Pu-yi over to China. For the next ten years, the former emperor was in a prison camp in Liaoning. After the prison guards said that he was reformed, he was freed from prison and was moved back to Beijing. He spent the rest of his life there as a common citizen. He worked as a gardener and then an editor. He earned 100 yuan a month. When he returned to the Forbidden City (which was made into the Imperial Palace Museum), he had to buy a ticket to enter. He thought that it was ironic that he had to buy a ticket just to visit his own home."

Endocrinology
Endocrinology studies the working of the endocrine system and hormones.
"It is the science of the endocrine system and hormones in a wide range of animals. Endocrinology is also a medical specialty. This means that when a doctor finishes studying medicine in general, they can choose endocrinology as the part of medicine they work in."
The endocrine system consists of several glands in different parts of the body. They secrete hormones directly into the blood. Hormones have many different functions and modes of action.
"Hormones are active in metabolism, growth and development, tissue function, sleep, digestion, respiration, excretion, mood, stress, lactation, movement, reproduction, and perception. Another field is behavioral endocrinology."
Medical aspects.
"Medical understanding of hormones began in the 19th century with Graves' disease, caused by a swelling of the thyroid gland. Since the mid-19th century many medical conditions have been found caused by hormone imbalance, that is, too much or too little of a hormone."
An endocrinologist can help people who have diseases related to their endocrine system. Diseases that an endocrinologist would treat include:
These are just examples; there are many other endocrine diseases.
Work can mean different things depending on how the word is used.

"The world's first and oldest writing comes from people who lived in today's Romania. Approximately 5300 years BC. According to archaeology it is not a matter of symbols, but the world's first writings. It belonged to the Vinča culture which inhabited all of today's Serbia with over 150 Vinča sites and minor parts of Western Romania, northwestern Bulgaria, eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina and Southeastern Hungary."
"Herodotus in the fourth book of The Histories, written in about 440 . Herodotus wrote that the Getae were defeated by the Persian Emperor Darius the Great when he battled the Scythians. The Getae were called the Dacians by the Romans. They were Thracians who were living in Dacia, which is where Romania, Moldova and the northern part of Bulgaria are now. The Dacians attacked the Roman province, the border of which was formed by the Danube, in 87 . This was during Emperor Domitian's rule. The Dacians were defeated by the Roman Empire under Emperor Trajan in two battles that lasted from 101 until 106 . The Roman Empire made Dacia into the province of Roman Dacia."
"A lot of ore, such as gold and silver, were found in Roman Dacia. A lot of gold and silver were found in the Western Carpathians. Trajan went back to Rome with 165 tons (330,000 pounds) of gold and 330 tons (660,000 pounds) of silver after his conquest."
There were many Romans living in the province of Roman Dacia. They spoke Vulgar Latin. They began to write the local languages using the Latin alphabet. Writing languages with the Latin alphabet is called romanization. This became the first version of Romanian.
"In the 3rd century, the province was attacked by groups of nomadic people like the Goths. They made the Roman Empire leave Dacia about 271 . This became the Roman Empire's first abandoned province."
The origin of modern Romanians is widely talked about by historians to this day. It is thought that the Romanians were formed from large ethnic groups that came from both the south and north parts of the Danube.
Dark Ages and Middle Ages.
"From 271 to 275, the Goths took over the abandoned Roman province. They lived in Dacia until the 4th century, when another group of wandering peoples, the Huns, came to Dacia. The Gepids, Avars, with the Slavic people, were in control of Transylvania through the 8th century. In the 8th century, however, the country was taken over by the Hungarian Empire. It was made part of the First Bulgarian Empire, which ended Romania's Dark Ages."
"The Bulgarians held Transylvania until the 11th century. The Pechenegs, the Cumans, and the Uzes were a few of the people later noted in the history of Romania."
"In 1310, now called the High Middle Ages, Basarab I started the Romanian principality of Wallachia. Moldavia was begun by Dragoş around 1352. During the Middle Ages, Romanians were living in three different areas: Wallachia (Romanian: ""Ţara Românească""—""Romanian Land""), Moldavia (Romanian: ""Moldova""), and Transylvania."
"Transylvania belonged to the Kingdom of Hungary from around the 10th century until the 16th century, when it turned into the Principality of Transylvania. This lasted until 1711. Wallachia had been on the border of the Ottoman Empire since the 14th century. As the Ottoman Empire's influence grew, it gradually fell under the suzerainty (control) of the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century."
"The best known ruler of this period was Vlad III the Impaler, also known as Vlad Dracula, or """", , Prince of Wallachia, during the years of 1448, 1456–62, and 1476. While he was the leader of his people, he had an agreement with the Ottoman Empire to stay independent. Many people in Romania during this time thought of him as a ruler with a great sense of justice and defense for his country."
"Moldavia was at its greatest when Stephen the Great was ruling between 1457 and 1504. He was a great military leader, winning 47 battles and losing only 2. After every battle he won, Stephen would build a church. Because he won 47 of the battles that he fought, he ended up building 48 churches. After Stephen the Great's death, Moldavia came under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire during the 16th century."
Independence and monarchy.
"When Transylvania was the organic part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Ottoman Empire was in control of Wallachia and Moldavia, almost all of the Romanians had limited rights as a citizen. They stayed this way even when they made up most of the people in those areas."
"After the even more violent Revolution of 1848 did not succeed, so explained the Great Powers did not like the idea of Romania becoming a free nation and it was not a real possibility."
The people who voted in 1859 in Moldavia and Wallachia picked the same person – Alexandru Ioan Cuza – to be the prince in those areas. He managed to unite the people and nationalism was seen as a useful method.
Alexandru Ioan Cuza walked with cautious steps he was not proclaiming a declaration of independence immediately because he knew it would bring a new war. Instead he let Moldavia and Wallachia merged in the United Principalities of the Ottoman Empire and increasing self-government to a greater degree.
"The new union was at the front of today's Romania. With cautious steps we freed itself more and Bucharest was established as the capital. However, farmers had more land when serfdom was abolished, which led to a coup d'état against the Alexandru Ioan Cuza staged by peasants who overthrew the regime."
"Prince Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen became the new leader, and was later called Prince Carol I of Romania. While the Russo-Turkish War was happening, Romania battled on the Russian side. When the Treaty of Berlin of 1878 was signed, the Great Powers made Romania an independent state. In return, they had to give Russia three of their southern districts of Bessarabia. In 1881, the principality became a kingdom, with Prince Carol ruling as King Carol I."
The World Wars and the Great Leaders.
"Filming took place in Corpus Christi, San Antonio and Houston, Texas from May to October 1996. Nava posted fliers in Texas asking Selena fans to attend the Houston Astrodome scene. News of this event spread throughout the United States and Mexico. Over 35,000 people attended, some coming from as far as Japan and South America. It took over 3 hours to put makeup on everyone who attended. Producing the Astrodome scene cost about $2 million. The budget of the movie was $20 million."
"The movie's trailer was released worldwide in December 1996. Nava spent $1 million on promotions for ""Selena""."
Music.
"The soundtrack of the movie was released on March 11, 1997 by EMI Latin. The soundtrack included two songs that Selena did not release when she was alive: ""Is It the Beat?"" and ""Where Did the Feeling Go?"". It included two medleys — ""Disco Medley"" and the ""Cumbia Medley"". They are live versions Selena sang during her Houston Astrodome concert. Two tribute songs were also in the album. ""Viviras Selena"" includes Tejano singers and the Barrio Boyzz. ""One More Time"", which was composed by Olmos is performed by Lil'Ray. The ""Oldies Medley"" was performed by the Vidal Brothers. The soundtrack reached at number seven on the US ""Billboard"" 200 chart and number 36 on Canada's ""RPM"". It was later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 1,000,000 copies in the United States. The album was produced by Selena's brother, Quintanilla III."
"Chuck Eddy of ""Entertainment Weekly"" gave the soundtrack an ""A"" rating and stated that the soundtrack had everything a ""right posthumous"" album should have. Eddy also stated that listening to the album reveals why Selena's death impacted many Americans. Enrique Lopetegui of the ""Los Angeles Times"" wrote that ""One More Time"" was a ""corny but effective"" tribute to Selena. Lopetegui commented that ""Viviras Selena"" was the ""weakest track"" of the album and that ""Is It the Beat?"" was one of the ""best songs"" of ""Selena"". He believed that ""Where Did the Feeling Go?"" was one of the ""strongest"". Lopetegui also stated that ""Where Did the Feeling Go?"" was similar to ""Vision of Love"" which was recorded by Mariah Carey. Lopetegui compared ""Is It the Beat?"" to the song ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)"" by Whitney Houston, which had similar beats and sounds. A ""Miami Herald"" writer believed the soundtrack was ""uneven"" and stated that Selena's unreleased recordings ""outshines"" the rest of the songs on the album. A score was released in the summer of 1997 and had music by Dave Grusin."
Release and reception.
"Before the movie was released, Selena fans were not happy that a Puerto Rican would play the part of a Mexican American singer. Many fans changed their views on Lopez after the Houston Astrodome scene was done filming. The movie opened in 1,850 theaters worldwide. ""Selena"" was released on March 21, 1997, and grossed $11,615,722, making it the second-highest debut for that week.

She became very popular after the movie was released. ""Selena"" was released on VHS and DVD in fall 1997. On September 18, 2007, Warner Bros. released a 10th anniversary of the movie. It featured unreleased ""behind the scenes"" and extras."
"The movie had mostly positive feedback from critics. Enrique Fernandez of the ""Sun Sentinel"" wrote that Nava did a great job in ""catching the audience"" with ""Selena"". Fernandez also stated that Lopez had a ""terrific characterization"" of Selena. Steve Persall of the ""St. Petersburg Times"" believed that Nava did not do a good job in retelling Selena's murder. Persall believed Nava was under pressure by Selena's family and fans to tell a more ""fairy tale"" movie then a ""real life event"". Daisann McLane of ""Sun Sentinel"" agreed that the movie was more of a ""fairy tale"" and that ""the movie is the family's version of the story"". McLane believed that ""Selena"" ""lie[d]"" about Selena's ""real life"". Stuart Elliott of ""Austin American-Statesmen"" wrote that ""Selena"" became a ""breakthrough success"" in Selena's career. Elliott believed that Nava had ""perfect[ed]"" every scene and that female Hispanics in America can relate to the conflicts and the climax of the story."

Digital camera
"A digital camera is a camera that stores pictures in electronic memory instead of film. Because of this, a digital camera can hold many more pictures than a traditional film camera. A digital camera can sometimes hold hundreds or thousands of pictures. Many use a memory card to store them. Most digital cameras can use a USB cable that connects into a computer to send pictures that are in the camera to the computer."
"Digital photography is a kind of photography where a digital camera is used to take photos. Digital cameras use an image sensor instead of photographic film. Very often, they also use a memory card to store the photos in a digital format. Most photography is digital, though some photographers still use the old film cameras."
"The majority of cameras are part of a mobile phone, called a ""camera phone"". They can send their pictures to other phones and other devices. Most camera phones do not make as good pictures as larger separate cameras do, especially where light is not bright."
Most digital cameras can serve as Video cameras. Some have a direct link to another computer where the data may be stored.
Data storage.
"When you take a picture or a video, it is saved on a memory device. The memory device can be internal - flash memory inside the camera, or external - memory cards, microdrives and so on. The most used method for saving pictures and videos from a camera is a SD card."
"The picture can be saved in a compressed file (JPEG, TIFF) or in an uncompressed, proprietary RAW file. The compressed picture is lower quality but the RAW picture has to be processed with a special computer program."
"A video is usually saved as an AVI, MPEG or MOV file format (it depends on the producer of the camera)."
"Most modern cameras also put Exif information in the picture file. This metadata information usually includes the date of taking the picture, the camera type, and its settings. Some cameras include GPS coordinates."
Cheers
"Cheers is a long-running American sitcom made by Charles-Burrows-Charles Productions in association with Paramount Television for NBC. The show premiered on September 30, 1982 and had its widely watched series finale on May 20, 1993, followed by a long and ongoing run in syndication. In eleven seasons, there were 270 episodes."
Setting.
"""Cheers"" was set in a Boston bar. This bar was where a group of friends would come to sit, drink alcohol, complain, and make practical jokes on a rival bar in town."
"The show's main theme in its early seasons was the romance between Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) and ex-baseball pitcher and bar owner Sam Malone (Ted Danson). Long's departure from the show in 1987 shifted the emphasis to Sam's relationship with a new character, Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley). Diane returned for the finale."
"The show also created the character Frasier Crane. Frasier got his own show (""Frasier"") the season after ""Cheers"" ended. Frasier's love interest Lilith Sternin appeared on both shows but Frasier and Lilith were no longer married in ""Frasier""."
"The producers, not wanting the show to be construed as promoting drinking, had Sam's character written as an ex-alcoholic. Most of the early episodes took place entirely within the confines of the bar. When the series became popular, some scenes were outside the bar."
"The outer shots of the bar were actually the Bull and Finch pub, north of Boston Common, which has become a tourist attraction because of its association with the series. It is said to be the bar that the series creators saw and wanted to model the bar in their show after. It has now been renamed Cheers on Beacon Hill, though its interior is quite different from the TV bar."
Ratings.
It was nearly cancelled during its first season (in which it ranked dead last among 63 shows). But it eventually became one of the most popular shows on TV because it had a top-ten rating during seven of its eleven seasons. The show earned 26 Emmy Awards out of a total of 111 nominations.

Life.
"He was born in Horn Lake, Mississippi and started playing harp at the age of five. In his teens he went to Memphis and lived with little income and a lot of discrimination. In the 1930s he played with many musicians across the Mississippi delta region."
"He made his first recording in Memphis with the guitarist Little Buddy Doyle. Due to poor health he worked outside the music industry in the 1940s. In the early 1950s he was one of the first musicians recording for Sam Phillips at Sun Records in Memphis, who would later record Elvis Presley. At this time he also was part of the Chicago blues scene, where he recorded amongst others with Eddie Taylor and Johnny Shines. After Junior Wells left the Muddy Waters Band he recorded one session with Waters. In the 1960s he recorded often as sideman for other musicians.

Horton appeared in the Maxwell Street scene in the 1980 film The Blues Brothers. His final recordings were made in 1980."
"He got his nickname ""Shakey"" because while playing he moved his head. He did his own first recording not until 1964 because he was a humble and shy person who did not like to be a leader.

Basseterre
"Basseterre , is the capital city of the Federation of Saint Christopher and Nevis, also called St Kitts and Nevis, in the West Indies. ""Basseterre"" port is at , on the south western coast of Saint Kitts Island. It is one of the chief commercial depots of the Leeward Islands. The city is in the parish of Saint George Basseterre and the southern part of the parish of Saint Peter Basseterre. In 2000 about 15,500 people lived in the city."
Basseterre is one of the oldest towns in the Eastern Caribbean.
History.
"Basseterre was founded in 1627 by the French, under Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc. It was the capital of the French colony of Saint-Christophe. The colony was the most northern and most southern parts of the island of St. Kitts. The middle part was held by Britain. When Phillipe de Longviliers de Poincy was made the French governor of St. Kitts in 1639, the town turned into a large, successful port, commanding Eastern Caribbean trade and colonisation. De Poincy then quickly made Basseterre capital of the entire French West Indies colony, which included the islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique. It was the capital until his death in 1660. The city was made capital of the entire island of St. Kitts in 1727. This is when the French were pushed off the island and the British took full control."
"The city of Basseterre has one of the most tragic histories of any Caribbean capital, destroyed many times by colonial wars, fire, earthquakes, floods, riots and hurricanes. Despite all of this, a large number of well-restored buildings still exist in downtown Basseterre."
Geographical Setting and Climate.
Geography.
"The city of Basseterre is on a bay on the southwestern shore of St. Kitts, Basseterre Bay. The city is in the large Basseterre Valley, almost completely surrounded by lush green hills and mountains. It is mostly low-lying, which is one explanation for the name which the French gave it, Basseterre . However, the name Basseterre is also due to the fact that the island is on the lee of winds of the island, and is thus a safe anchorage. The name Capesterre, given to the region to the North, was dubbed so as it was facing the wind. Basseterre is surrounded by the Olivees Mountains to the north and the Conaree-Morne peaks to the east. The city is drained by the College River and the Westbourne River, which are locally known as ""ghauts"" and are dry most of the year. They even form streets in downtown Basseterre. This engineering folly has proven quite disastrous though, as College River has been the scene of many disastrous in Basseterre history. Port Zante, in the centre of the bay, is on of land reclaimed from the sea in 1995."
Climate.
"Under the Köppen climate classification, Basseterre features a tropical rainforest climate. Temperatures remain constant throughout the course of the year, 27 °C year-round. Basseterre has no dry season; all 12 months on average sees more than of precipitation. On average, of rain falls on the city annually."
Around town.
"Basseterre is a very small town which is laid out in a grid pattern. It has four main streets running east-west: Bay Road, Liverpool Row, Central Street and Cayon Street. The main street running north to south is Fort Street/Bank Street, which is home to the bulk of the island's main shops and banks. The city has 2 centres, at The Circus, which is geared towards tourism purposes, and the Independence Square, which contains the cathedral, courthouse and most of the older buildings."
"Basseterre is the main commercial and industrial centre of St. Kitts. It is also the country's main port of entry, for both sea and air travel, as well as the road and rail transport hub. It houses the administration buildings for the federal government (those for the island of Nevis are in Charlestown). It also houses the headquarters of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, as well as the headquarters for many other regional financial institutions."
"Despite its small size, Basseterre played host to Carifesta VII (the Caribbean Festival of Arts) in 2000, outbidding rivals many times its size. The city was able to outbid the United States of America, to host matches for the 2007 World Cricket Cup. The Warner Park Sporting Complex was the site of the allocated first round matches of the tournament. This made St. Kitts and Nevis the smallest country in the world ever to host a World Cup event."
"Basseterre and its environs are home to many small, American-owned medical schools such as Windsor University, and also two prestigious medical institutions founded by Robert Ross: the Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine and the International University of Nursing. The city has four secondary schools, two of which are government owned, and two are private schools."
"The night adders have very big venom glands, which are around 10 centimeters long. But even though the venom glands are big, the adders don't always use their venom on their prey. The venom would kill the prey fast enough, but they usually seize their prey and swallow it."
"When someone is bitten by a night adder, the venom does not spread around the body, and only causes swelling in the place of the bite. There have been no reports of deaths by night adder venom."
Common night adder
The common night adder is a species of venomous vipers found in sub-Saharan Africa.
Description.
"The common night adder can grow up to around 60 centimeters (24 in) long, making it the longest species of the genus ""Causus"". The longest ever recorded was a male found in eastern Zimbabwe which was 93 centimeters (around 37 in) long. They are usually olive green, brown, or grayish-brown in color with black rhombic-shaped blotches, but not all have blotches on them."
Common names.
"The common night adder is also called the ""rhombic night adder"", the ""demon night adder"", the ""Cape Viper"", and the ""African night adder""."
Where they live.
"The common night adder is found in the savannas of Sub-Saharan Africa, from Nigeria, east to Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya, south to Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Zambia, Malawi, Zimbabwe, northern Botswana, Mozambique, Swaziland, and eastern South Africa."
Behavior.
"The common night adder is a fairly fast species of snake; it can move at the speed of 3.3 km per hour. They are usually found on the ground, but they can climb trees and can swim. They are mainly nocturnal, but some have been seen basking in the early morning or late afternoon. When disturbed they coil up, inflate their body (which makes the black blotches on them stand out), and start hissing loudly."
"Common night adders are oviparous, meaning that they lay eggs, while other vipers are usually viviparous, meaning that they give live birth. Females lay around two dozen eggs at a time, which take around four months to hatch. Once hatched, the young are 10 to 12.5 cm long and eat small frogs and toads."
Feeding.
"Their diet is made up of mainly frogs and toads, and sometimes small mammals like mice and rats."
Polystyrene
"Polystyrene is a form of chemical compound that is mainly used for a wide variety of packaging. It is an aromatic polymer made from the monomer styrene, a liquid hydrocarbon that is manufactured from petroleum by the chemical industry. Polystyrene is one of the most widely used plastics, the scale being several billion kilograms per year."
Polystyrene can be in either a thermoset or a thermoplastic form.
Allometry
"Allometry is the study of the relationship of body size to shape. In particular, it refers to the rate of growth of one part of the body compared to other parts."
"In most cases, the relative size of body parts changes as the body grows. Most allometric relationships are adaptive. For example, organs which depend on their surface area (such as the intestine) grow faster as the body weight increases."
"Also, there are changes in allometry as a clade evolves. Allometry is an important way to describe changes in gross morphology (body shape) during evolution. Changes in time of development in an evolutionary series or clade are very common. The trend is known as heterochrony."
"Allometry was first outlined by Otto Snell in 1892, D'Arcy Thompson in 1917, and Julian Huxley in 1932. The relationship between two measured quantities is often expressed as a power law:"
or in a logarithmic form:
where formula_3 is the scaling exponent of the law.
On being the right size.
"J.B.S. Haldane's 1926 essay ""On being the right size"" gives an overview of the way size interacts with body structure. Haldane's thesis is that sheer size very often defines what bodily equipment an animal must have:"
"Many of his examples are based on the square-cube law. If an animal's length is doubled, its surface area will be squared and its weight cubed. This alone causes allometric changes in any evolutionary lineage where successive species get larger or smaller. There are many such lineages."
"After the Cold War, Romania became closer friends with Western Europe. In 2004, Romania joined NATO and hosted the 2008 summit. The country applied in June 1993 for membership in the European Union and became an Associated State of the EU in 1995, an Acceding Country in 2004, and a member on January 1, 2007."
Geography.
Romania is a part of southeastern Europe. It borders the Black Sea and the Danube River. The Carpathian Mountains lie in the center.
"Romania is the biggest country in southeast Europe by population. It has an area of . It is the twelfth-largest country in Europe. Most of Romania's border with Serbia and Bulgaria is made by the Danube. The Danube joins the Prut River. The Prut River makes the Moldovan–Romanian border. The Danube then flows into the area of the Black Sea inside Romania. This makes the Danube Delta. The delta is a biosphere reserve and a biodiversity World Heritage Site. Some of the other major rivers in Romania are the Siret, the Olt, and the Mureş. The Siret River runs from the north to the south of Moldavia. The Olt River runs from the Carpathian Mountains to Oltenia. The Mureş runs through Transylvania from the east to the west."
Landscape.
"The land in Romania is made up of equal parts of mountains, hills, and low-lying areas. The Carpathian Mountains make up a big part of the center of Romania. Fourteen of its mountain ranges are taller than . The tallest mountain in Romania is Moldoveanu Peak, with a peak altitude of ."
Rivers.
The Danube is the longest river in Romania. Its length inside Romania is about . That is almost half of the length of the entire Danube. Almost all of the rivers in Romania are either direct or indirect tributaries of the Danube.
Weather.
Romania has a climate that changes between temperate and continental climates. The reason for the climate changes is because Romania is near the coast. Romania has four different seasons. The average temperature during the year is in southern Romania and in the northern part.
"Lots of rain and snow falls on the highest western mountains. Most of this falls as snow. In the southern parts of the country, the amount of rain and snow that falls is around ."
"The lowest temperature ever taken in Romania was , at Braşov in 1944. The highest temperature ever recorded in Romania was , near Calafat in the 1950s."
Society.
These are the development regions of Romania:
Language and culture.
The official language of Romania is Romanian. The Romanian language is an Eastern Romance language.
"Romania has its own culture because of where it is found. It is the point where 3 different areas meet: Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and the Balkans. Romanian culture is a mix of all these areas. The culture of Romania was influenced by the Greeks, Romans, and Slavs."
Religion.
"Romania is a secular state. This means Romania has no national religion. The biggest religious group in Romania is the Romanian Orthodox Church. It is an autocephalous church inside of the Eastern Orthodox communion. In 2002, this religion made up 86.7% of the population. Other religions in Romania include Roman Catholicism (4.7%), Protestantism (3.7%), Pentecostalism (1.5%), Islam (1%) and the Romanian Greek-Catholicism (0.9%)."
Cities.
"Bucharest is the capital of Romania. It also is the biggest city in Romania, with a population of over 2 millions peoples."
"There are 5 other cities in Romania that have a population of more than 300,000 people. These are Iaşi, Cluj-Napoca, Timişoara, Constanţa, and Craiova. Romania also has 5 cities that have more than 200,000 people living in them: Galaţi, Braşov, Ploieşti, Brăila, and Oradea."
"Thirteen other cities in Romania have a population of more than 100,000 people."
Economy.
"Romania joined the European Union on January 1, 2007. Romania's economy is healthy. Currently, Romania makes around $350 billion in Gross domestic product and a GDP per capita of $16,540."
"Long into the 1900s, Romania was still a largely agricultural country. During Communism 1947-1989, the country had planned economy. The transition from planned economy to a market economy after the communist regime led to economic collapse in the 1990s, the reasons was that more money was printed, expensive prices and substantial privatization of the companies, which initially leads to skyrocketing unemployment. The reforms in the 1990s allowed foreign investors for the first time to buy land in Romania. When it was going explosively good for the industry in the Latin countries such as France, Italy and Spain, these countries began to trade with Romania because it is favorite voice country for them to grow in. Foreign companies expanding in Romania since then, and spurs the market."
Education.
"The Romanian school is obligatory for 10 years. Children also have the opportunity to be part of a voluntary pre-school at an early age 3–6 years. After school, students can voluntarily take the entrance exam to high school, which has a range of practical and theoretical lines. There are over 40 higher educational institutions, including five universities and five technical colleges. Tuition is free and is a hot political commitment even at the university. The country's minorities have the opportunity to receive instruction in their native language. Since 1989, education has been reformed. But it has been slow and the standard of education varies greatly in different parts of the country, education has improved the standard of urban compared to rural areas where quality can be very low. Romania participates fully in the EU's education program."
Social welfare.
The unemployment rate in Romania is five per-cent and has been low for many years.
"The living standards were very low at the end of the Communist era, but the situation was just only improved a little bit during the 1990s. On the contrary, the living significantly due caused by the large privatization of jobs that resulted in high unemployment and rising prices. In later years lived yet 2010 nearly 10 percent of the population in absolute poverty and of these, 90% live in rural areas. The State social insurance system have relatively broad coverage but resources are extremely small."
"Reforms have been initiated and in 1999 the health insurance became privatized and paid by the employers and the employees. Several thousand local trade unions were founded after the revolution, which were later amalgamated (combined) into federations. These unions and federations have helped organise students, pensioners and the unemployed; because these groups of people all have similar needs, concerns and goals."
"Sometimes the mother is confused, thinking that nothing has happened to her son. Throughout the film, she writes a letter addressed to Osama bin Laden. He is assumed to be responsible for the attack."
Production.
"Filming began on 26 March 2007 in London, England. Scenes were filmed on location in Northampton Square and the Brunswick Estate in Islington, North London. Filming also took place at Leyton Orient's Brisbane Road stadium and around St Albans Cathedral, St Albans School, and Westminster Lodge."
"The production also visited The Metropolitan Training College facilities near Gravesend to shoot the scenes at the football stadium, after the bomb has exploded."
Reception.
"The film received poor reviews. Tom Charity, after viewing the film at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, gave it one star out of five. He called it an ""ambitious/opportunistic effort that misses the mark, from the one-dimensional characters to the craven plotting and sentimental tone."""
"Philip French called it an ""ambitious British picture on an urgent topical subject [that] is torpedoed by a poor script."""
"""Time Out"" gave it two stars out of six. It wrote ""there are so many things wrong with writer-director Sharon Maguire’s first film since ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" in 2001 that it's hard to know where to start, but the fatal problem is that this is a film with an identity crisis""; the film at times seems like a ""study of guilt and grief"" and at other times a ""conspiracy thriller"" but ""ends up being a compendium of bizarre diversions, most of which are utterly surplus to the film’s half-cocked desire to stick with the experience and emotions of its main character."""
Peter Gunn (actor)
"Peter Gunn (born 13 February 1963) is an English actor. He has appeared in many television series and films since his career began in 1988. Gunn is known for his role as Brian Packham in the long running ITV soap opera ""Coronation Street"" (2010–2013, 2015–present)."

Erikson's stages of psychosocial development
"Erikson's stages of psychosocial development is the name of a theory of psychology: Erik Erikson and his wife Joan Erikson coined the term. They found that during their lives, most people pass through eight stages of development."
Escape Room 2
"Escape Room: Tournament of Champions is a 2021 psychological horror movie directed by Adam Robitel. The movie stars Taylor Russell, Logan Miller, Isabelle Fuhrman, Thomas Cocquerel, Holland Roden, Carlito Olivero, and Indya Moore. It serves as a sequel to the 2019 movie ""Escape Room""."
Plot.
"After escaping the ""sole survivor"" escape rooms orchestrated by the Minos Corporation, Zoey Davis and Ben Miller decide to confront the shadowy organization after finding coordinates to its New York City–based headquarters. Zoey is encouraged by her therapist to move on from her trauma and to get over her aerophobia, but she opts to drive with Ben instead of flying."
"The pair find the headquarters derelict and are accosted by a vagrant who steals Zoey's necklace. She and Ben give chase straight into the Q subway train. Their train car separates from the rest of the train and is redirected to a remote station, sealing Zoey, Ben, and other passengers Rachel, Brianna, Nathan, and Theo inside. As the passengers realize in horror that they are once again in Minos' deadly game, the train becomes electrified. Zoey and Ben learn that the others are the ""winners"" of previous escape rooms, having survived them. To escape, the group must collect subway tokens as the electrification increases. Theo is killed while the rest escape. Nathan reveals his escape room group were all priests, Brianna's were all influencers, and Rachel's consisted of people who cannot feel physical pain."
"The next room is a bank with a slowly closing vault and a deadly laser security system. The group manages to decipher the complex route to get around the lasers and escape with just seconds to spare. While in the room, Zoey is perplexed by frequent references to someone called Sonya and that the escape rooms have no apparent connection to the group unlike before."
The next room is a postcard-like beach with more references to Sonya. They discover that the beach is covered in quicksand. Nathan sacrifices himself to save Rachel and is swallowed up by the sand. Zoey finds an alternate route out just as Brianna unlocks the intended exit. An argument on which route to take breaks out; Rachel and Ben side with Zoey. Brianna escapes through the main exit while Rachel and Ben traverse to the alternate route. Ben falls into the quicksand.
"Zoey and Rachel make their way out through a manhole back into the city. Overjoyed at first that they're outside, they quickly realize they are still in the game when they encounter a panicked Brianna. If they don't make it out of this room, acid rain is periodically sprayed on them. The group opens a taxi to escape into but once Zoey enters, the taxi locks Rachel and Brianna out. Zoey falls into the next room while Rachel and Brianna succumb to the rain and die."
"The next room is a child's bedroom containing a diary from Sonya, revealing the rooms are based on a fun day out she had with her mother. Zoey discovers Sonya's mother is Amanda Harper, who survived her fall in her original escape room and was forced into designing escape rooms for Minos after they abducted her daughter. Amanda appears and begs Zoey to become the next puzzle-maker for Minos, warning that she has no choice. Ben is revealed to be trapped in a cage. When Zoey refuses Minos' demand, Ben's cage starts filling with water, but Zoey and Amanda work together to free him. They manage to break out, fleeing the facility. They report their findings to the police, who retrieve the bodies of Rachel, Brianna, Nathan, and Theo; the news about Minos goes public. An FBI agent assures Zoey that Minos will be tracked down."
"In 1814, Napoleon I abdicated the French throne. That freed up experienced British troops to be sent to North America. They burned the unfinished Washington, DC, and also attacked Baltimore. An American lawyer, Francis Scott Key wrote a poem about the Battle of Baltimore. The poem was later used to give the words to a song that later became the US national anthem: ""The Star Spangled Banner."" The war ended in 1815. The British attacked New Orleans but were stopped by the Americans under General Andrew Jackson."
"Unknown by both sides, a peace treaty had already been signed."
Peace.
"The two countries signed the Treaty of Ghent to end the war, on December 24, 1814 in Belgium. Fighting continued into January 1815 because the forces did not know about the treaty, but no great changes took place afterward. The British stopped impressing sailors because the Napoleonic Wars had been finished."
"Most Americans heard of the victory in the Battle of New Orleans before they heard of the treaty. The Federalist Party, which had opposed the war, became disliked as pro-British and soon disappeared."
Winner.
"From the British perspective, the War of 1812 was a minor sideshow. The Americans called it their victorious ""Second War for Independence"". The British remembered it as the Americans trying to take advantage of their being involved in a war against the French Empire and paid no attention to American grievances."
"In Canada, the War of 1812 was an unwanted war. It concerned the distant capitals of Washington, DC, and London, not them. In Lower Canada, now Quebec, it was considered an Anglo-Saxon war. In Quebec there was little love for the British, but the British had guaranteed their right to speak French. Since they did not know what would happen if the Americans took over, they chose the lesser evil and supported the British."
"Upper Canada (later part of the Province of Ontario) had been settled by American Loyalists who fled after the Revolutionary War. They had little love of their former countrymen in the US but had become outnumbered by Americans who later came north to settle. When the Americans attempted to invade Canada, the Canadian militias were eager to defend their homeland."
"In US history, the War of 1812 is the most obscure conflict. The average American remembers very little about the war. Some may remember The Star Spangled Banner, the Burning of Washington, or the Battle of New Orleans. Otherwise, it is a little-understood conflict. The issues are complex. Most scholars would agree it was fought over maritime issues. Since the British Navy was then the most powerful in the world, it was easier to attack the British on land by invading Canada. Former US President Thomas Jefferson predicted the ""acquisition of Canada, will be a mere matter of marching."""
"British who knew about the little war felt that they had won, no matter what Americans thought. Canadians kept their independence from the US and so felt that they had won. The Americans felt they won although they lost in Canada since they lost none of their territory, repelled the invasion of Maryland, were free to fight the Indians without British interference, and were no longer impressed on the high seas. Of all three, the British are perhaps the happiest because they have completely forgotten about the war."
Chandigarh
"Chandigarh, also called ""The Beautiful City"", is a city in India. It is a union territory, because it is the capital of two states: Punjab and Haryana. As a territory it does not belong to either state. Before 1 November,1966 it was capital of Punjab, but after formation of Haryana on 1 November, 1966 it become a union territory.There are many tourism places in Chandigarh like Rock garden, Rose garden and Sukhna lake."
"Chandigarh came into existence in 1952 when its first stone was laid. It is one of the modern cities of India, designed by a French architect Le Carbusier. It was the dream city of India's first Prime Minister, Sh.Jawahar Lal Nehru."
"It is well known for its mixed cultural background and its fast development in the field of Information Technology. It has outlets of many famous multinational companies established here and is emerging as a hub for business development. The territory covers an area of 44 mi² or 114 km², it is bigger than Montserrat but smaller than Jersey. It's also the proposed capital of Khalistan."
Convection
Convection is the movement of heat because of the movement of warm matter.
"For example, atmospheric circulation moves warm air to cool places, causing wind. Wind, in turn, can enter and cool a room if the window is open. The movement of the clouds, the ocean currents and many types of heaters are examples of convection."
Forced convection and natural convection.
"Convection can happen naturally (""natural convection"") or because of a moving device (""forced convection"")."
"The fan is a device that produces the movement of the air artificially. The air in this case is moving because of the rotation of the fan. This is an example of ""forced convection""."
"Natural convection happens because a fluid is lighter if is hot and it is heavier if is cold, so if a fluid has a hot part and a cold part, the hot part will naturally move upward and the cold part naturally moves downward. For example, if the water in a pot is hotter near the bottom because of the fire, it moves from the bottom to the surface. At the same time the water near the surface is colder so it moves to the bottom."
Convection currents.
"Convection currents occur when there are significant differences in temperature between two parts of a fluid. When this happens, hot fluids rise and cold fluids sink. This causes movements or currents in the fluid. Atmospheric circulation, for example, is made by convection currents."
Chipmunk
"A chipmunk is a small squirrel-like rodent. It is in the Sciuridae family. About twenty-three species fall under this title, with one species in North America."
"The name may have originally been spelled ""chitmunk"" (perhaps from a Native American word meaning ""red squirrel""). However, the earliest form comes from the Oxford English Dictionary (in 1842) as ""chipmonk"". Other early forms include ""chipmuck"" and ""chipminck""."
"Chipmunks are hoarders, meaning they store food for winter."
Popular culture.
"He was 41 when he was shot in the head in the men's room in his University, Divine School where he was teaching on May 21 1991. At times he preached against communism and its system of brainwashing youth. It is alleged that he was killed on the orders of outgoing Romanian Communist Party leaders."
Single (music)
"In popular music marketing, a single is a record release with only one or two songs. The first song (usually the one given the most promotion, and heard more often in the media) is called an A-side, while any other song on the single is called a B-side."
"The pairing of recordings on a single comes from the days of shellac and vinyl records, when discs had two playable sides. Modern compact disc singles may contain more than one version of either the A- or B-side, or sometimes an additional recording by the same performer. B-sides may be selections from an album, or songs not otherwise issued for sale."
"Many times the chance to get a new song issued as an A-side creates competition between members of bands, or teams of songwriters. John Lennon and Paul McCartney of the Beatles tried to write better songs than each other, to get more A-sides than the other. George Harrison, also a Beatle, rarely had his songs chosen for singles, but had a hit with ""Something"" for the band."
"In the days of vinyl singles, royalties for both A- and B-sides were paid equally. Many listeners never played B-sides more than once, and radio focused on A-sides. Many people who made recordings knew this, and used it to earn extra money from sales, or to promote other music they made. Phil Spector sometimes used short jam sessions by his studio band as B-sides to singles he produced."
"Michael Nesmith of the Monkees wanted his songs to appear on Monkees singles. He would settle for B-sides, if he could not get an A-side. Don Kirshner, who oversaw the band's early music, wanted the B-sides to come from other songwriters who worked for him. Nesmith and Kirshner disagreed, and it caused tension for the Monkees and their company."
"Records that include more than two or three songs are usually called EPs (for ""extended play""), and may include four or more distinct songs, but not as many as on an album."
Captain America
"Captain America is a fictional superhero from the Marvel Comics. He made his first appearance in the comic book ""Captain America Comics #1"" in 1941""."" He wears a suit that has a white star on his chest with 2 stripes (still white) on each side next to the star. His suit is blue. He also has an indestructible shield with a bullseye and a star on the front of it. He is also known as his alter ego Steve Rogers. Captain America had a sidekick (friend), Bucky who later became the Winter Soldier, is a very good fighter, both hand-to-hand and using his guns to take care of his enemies easily. Captain America has an nemesis called Red Skull. He later joins a team called the Avengers to help protect the world."
Power and abilities.
"Captain America has superhuman strength, superhuman stamina, and can live without eating, sleeping and resting."
Film and TV.
"He first appeared in the serial (film) Captain America, which was from 1940."
"He appears in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, played by Chris Evans. He was in ' (2011), ' (2014) and """" (2016), as well as Marvel's ""The Avengers"" (2012), and (2015), (2018), and (2019)."
In Real Life.
"In 1966, Joe Simon (one of the people who helped make Captain America) sued Marvel, saying that he was the one who should be able to use the character, not them. It was agreed that Captain America was made under the publisher's rules, and belonged to them. This meant that Marvel won."
Objectivity (journalism)
Objectivity is a significant principle of journalistic professionalism. It involves presenting information that can be relied upon.
"Objectivity may have several meanings in the eye of the public. ""Fairness"" involves making sure that multiple sides of an issue are presented. ""Disinterestedness"" means that the presenters are neutral in a story in which the people involved try to influence them. ""Factuality"" bases story content on facts that can be checked by an independent agent. ""Nonpartisanship"" means not taking sides, especially on political matters. Depending on the topic of a story, any or all of these factors may be relevant in the journalist's remaining objective."
"The editorial board of media outlets such as the press or broadcast news chooses what information to present, so the editors' selection may be biased toward one position or belief system."
"In many countries, ""advocacy journalism,"" which supports a particular position, is considered as a legitimate sort of professional journalism. These stories may be either news or analysis. They may or may not be objective."
Definitions.
"Few journalists would make a claim to total neutrality or impartiality. However, most try to keep distance from their own personal biases in their news work. In ""Discovering the News"" (1978), sociologist Michael Schudson argues that ""the belief in objectivity is a faith in 'facts,' a distrust in 'values,' and a commitment to their segregation."" In the United States, an objective story is typically considered to be one that steers a middle path between two poles of political rhetoric."
"Journalism without any bias, as if one just came to Earth from another planet and had no opinions about our behavior or ways is rarely practiced, although some argue it would lead to radical changes in reporting. (See, for example, Noam Chomsky, The Journalist from Mars.)"
Genesis Nomad
The Genesis Nomad is a portable video game console released by the Sega Corporation. It has a colour screen and can play most games designed for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis.
It cannot be used with the Sega CD and Sega 32X unless special modifications are made. But such special modifications may not be safe.
"There are many political parties in Greece, but only seven are in the Greek parliament. Until 2015, only two political parties formed governments, the PASOK party (which is social democratic) and New Democracy (ND, which is conservative). The government ousted in the 2015 election was led by PASOK, DIMAR, AND ND. Other parties include the Communist party, the left-wing SYRIZA party, the nationalist party and others. SYRIZA, led by Alexis Tsipras, won the 2015 parliamentary election held on January 25 of that year, and entered into a coalition government with the small right-wing party ""Greek Independents""."
The New Democracy Party won the 2019 election.
Divisions.
"The divisions of Greece are called 'Peripheries'. As of January 2011, there are 13 peripheries in Greece. Peripheries are subdivided into 'peripheral units', and previously they were known as 'prefecture', but prefectures were abolished in 2011. The most populated peripheries in Greece are Attica, where the capital city of Greece, Athens, is, and Central Macedonia, where Greece's second-largest city, Thessaloniki, is. All the peripheries, and their capital cities, are:"
Demographics.
People.
"Greece is a small country compared to other countries such as the United States, Spain , Italy, the United Kingdom and Russia. The population of Greece is estimated to be over 11 million. Most of the people in Greece are Greek people, and they form 94% of the population of the country. There are also many Albanians in Greece, and they make up 4% of the population. Other nationalities make up for another 2% of the country."
"The Greek government recognizes only the Muslim minority in the country, the Turkish one in the region of Western-Thrace. They include Pomak and Xoraxane Roma. The majority of them live in cities like Xanthi and Komotini. The dispute between Greece and the Republic of North Macedonia has resulted in the refusal of Greece to acknowledge the existence of a Macedonian minority. The 2001 population census showed only 747 citizens of the Republic of North Macedonia in Greece. The Republic of North Macedonia says that there are a maximum of 300,000 ethnic Macedonians in Greece, but Greece says that if there is a minority in the country, it would not be more than 30,000 people, in the northern part of the country, near the border with the Republic of North Macedonia. This is also supported by international organizations."
Greek flag.
"The Greek flag was officially adopted in 1828 as a civil and state ensign (a flag for use only on boats and ships) and as a national flag when flown outside of Greece, for example on embassies. A different flag (white cross on a blue field) was used as a land flag within Greece from 1828 until 1969 and from 1975 to 1978. In 1978 the current flag became national flag and the older land flag was abolished."
"There are many theories about the origin of the color of the flag. One says that blue represents the color of the sea and the white represents the waves, and others include white for the waves and blue for the sky and white for purity and breaking away from tyranny, and blue for Greece. There are nine stripes on the flag, which according to the legend represent the nine syllables in the phrase “Ελευθερία ή Θάνατος’’ which means “freedom or death.’’ The cross stands for Christianity."
Economy.
"Greece is a capitalist country, like the United States and France. Greece has the largest number of trading ships (a 'merchant navy') in the world. Tourism is also a major source of income for Greece. In the 20th century Greece had its own currency but now uses the Euro as most other European Community countries do."
"Greece has adopted some welfare state policies, such as public healthcare and free education, like many other European countries. Greece, however, has not collected enough taxes to pay for them. The pension system is especially expensive."
"This is putting Greece in a very difficult situation when the country has accumulated a debt of about €350 billion or debt by 170 percent of the country's total GDP. Greece also has a trade deficit, meaning that it buys more things than it sells. The country is cutting costs and asking for loans in order to avoid bankruptcy."
Tourism.
"About 30 million tourists visit Greece each year. That is more than the country’s entire population. To serve the many tourists, Greece has many international airports. Tourism also makes up more than 20% of the Greek GDP."
Sweden
Sweden () is a Nordic country in the part of Europe called Scandinavia. Its neighbors are Finland and Norway. Sweden is also connected to Denmark in the south by a bridge. It is a developed country. It is famous for its welfare state. People who live in Sweden are called Swedes.
"The population of Sweden is about 10 million people. Sweden's capital city is Stockholm, which is also Sweden's largest city, with almost one million people. Other large cities are Gothenburg and Malmö. These cities are all in the southern half of the country, where it is not as cold as in the north. Swedes drink filmjölk, it is a traditional fermented milk product from Sweden. It is made by fermenting cow's milk. Glögg, is spiced mulled wine which people drink around Christmas. It normally contains red wine, sugar, orange peel, and spices. Swedes eat yellow pea soup with pork (or pork sausages) along with mustard."
"Sweden is a constitutional monarchy because it has a king, Carl XVI Gustaf, but he does not have any real power. Sweden is a parliamentary state meaning that the government is elected by the parliament which is appointed by the people. The country is democratically ruled by a government headed by an elected prime minister. Ulf Kristersson was elected Prime Minister in September 2022. He took office in October 2022."
"Sweden has an official majority language, Swedish (the Swedish word for the language is ""svenska""). Sweden has five official minority languages: Finnish, Yiddish, Sami, Meänkieli, and Romani."
"Sweden became a member of the European Union (EU) on 1 January 1995. Unlike most countries in the European Union, Sweden is not a member of the Eurozone and has not begun to use the euro as currency. This is because the people have voted against using the euro. The currency remains the Swedish krona (Swedish crown)."
History.
"Sweden has been a kingdom for a thousand years. In the Middle Ages, Sweden had the same king as Denmark and Norway. In the early 16th century Sweden got its own king, Gustav Vasa. During the 17th century Sweden was a great power. Sweden had taken Estonia, Latvia, and Finland and parts of Norway, Germany, and Russia. In the 18th century Sweden became weaker and lost these places. In the early 19th century, Sweden's king died without an heir and the Swedish parliament voted for Jean Baptiste Bernadotte as the new king. Bernadotte fought Denmark and made them allow Norway to enter a personal union with Sweden."
"This was Sweden's last war, and Sweden has not been at war for 200 years. In 1905, the Swedish-Norwegian personal union was dissolved. In many wars, including World War I and the Cold War, the country was neutral, meaning it did not take sides. During World War II, it traded with both the British and the Germans in order to protect its neutrality."
Region.
"Sweden has 25 historical provinces (""landskap""). They are found in three different regions: Norrland in the North, Svealand in the central region, and Götaland in the South."
Counties.
"Sweden is divided into 21 counties. They are Stockholm, Uppsala, Södermanland, Östergötland, Jönköping, Kronoberg, Kalmar, Gotland, Blekinge, Skåne, Halland, Västra Götaland, Värmland, Örebro, Västmanland, Dalarna, Gävleborg, Västernorrland, Jämtland, Västerbotten, and Norrbotten."
County governments largely regulate regional public transportation and healthcare.
"Most earthquakes form part of a sequence, related to each other in terms of location and time. Most earthquake clusters consist of small tremors which cause little to no damage, but there is a theory that earthquakes can recur in a regular pattern."
"A foreshock is an earthquake that happens before a larger earthquake, called the mainshock."
"An aftershock is an earthquake that happens after a previous earthquake, the mainshock. An aftershock is in the same place of the main shock but always of a smaller magnitude. Aftershocks are formed as the crust adjusts to the effects of the main shock."
"Earthquake swarms are sequences of earthquakes striking in a specific area within a short period of time. They are different from earthquakes followed by a series of aftershocks by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is obviously the main shock, therefore none have notably higher magnitudes than the other. An example of an earthquake swarm is the 2004 activity at Yellowstone National Park."
"Sometimes a series of earthquakes happen in a sort of earthquake storm, where the earthquakes strike a fault in clusters, each triggered by the shaking or stress redistribution of the previous earthquakes. Similar to aftershocks but on adjacent segments of fault, these storms happen over the course of years, and with some of the later earthquakes as damaging as the early ones. Such a pattern happened in the North Anatolian fault in Turkey in the 20th century."
Tsunami.
"A Tsunami or a chain of fast moving waves in the ocean caused by powerful earthquakes is a very serious challenge for people's safety and for earthquake engineering. Those waves can inundate coastal areas, destroy houses and even swipe away whole towns. This is a danger for the whole mankind."
"Unfortunately, tsunamis cannot be prevented. However, there are warning systems which may warn the population before the big waves reach the land to let them enough time to rush to safety."
Earthquake-proofing.
"Earthquake-proof buildings are constructed to withstand the destructive force of an earthquake. This depends upon its type of construction, shape, mass distribution, and rigidity. Different combinations are used. Square, rectangular, and shell-shaped buildings can withstand earthquakes better than skyscrapers. To reduce stress, a building's ground floor can be supported by extremely rigid, empty columns, while the rest of the building is supported by flexible columns inside the empty columns. Another method is to use rollers or rubber pads to separate the base columns from the ground, allowing the columns to shake parallel to each other during an earthquake."
"To help prevent a roof from collapsing, builders make the roof out of light-weight materials. Outdoor walls are made with stronger and more reinforced materials such as steel or reinforced concrete. During an earthquake, flexible windows may help hold the windows together so they don't break."
Colour
"Colour (Commonwealth English) or color (American English) is a property of light as seen by people. In Commonwealth English, it is spelled “colour” (notice the U), while in American English it is “color” (no U)."
The most common colour names are:
"""Primary colours"" can be mixed to make other colours. Red, yellow, and blue are the three traditional primary colours. The primary colours for television screens and computer monitors are red, green and blue. Printers and paints use magenta, yellow, and cyan as their primary colours; they may also use black. Sometimes this set of colours is simply called red, yellow, and blue."
People who can not see colours or have a distorted sense of colour are called colour blind. Most colour blind people are male.
"Colours are sometimes added to food. Food colouring is used to colour food, but some foods have natural colourings, like beta carotene."
"When something has no colour, it is transparent. An example is air."
"The science of color is sometimes called chromatics, colorimetry, or simply color science."
"A translucent material is not the same as a colourless material because it can still have a colour, like stained glass."
Scurvy
"Scurvy is a disease (sickness). It is caused by not eating enough vitamin C. But scurvy can be prevented. It has many symptoms. People who have scurvy get spots on their skin, especially on their legs. Their teeth may loosen and/or fall out. They may bleed from the mouth, nose, and gums (mucus membranes). A person with scurvy will look pale and feel sad (see depression). They will not be able to move easily, because their joints hurt."
"Scurvy can be easily cured. Oranges and other fruits can restore normal vitamin levels. In the past, sailors more commonly got scurvy due to being unable to access these foods. Fresh fruit could not be kept for long. The main cause of scurvy is lack of fresh fruits and vegetables. It is now uncommon."
Signs of scurvy.
"At first, a person with scurvy may:"
A bit later a person with scurvy may:
Treatment.
"When a person gets help for scurvy, they usually get better very quickly. Babies start eating again after one or two days of help. The symptoms get better within seven days."
Food sources.
"Eating vitamin C prevents scurvy. How much vitamin C a person needs changes with his or her age and is different for pregnant and lactating women. The following is the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences, National Research Council's advice on how much vitamin C to eat every day:"
"Sociologists research the structures that organize society, such as race, gender (whether a person is male or female), and social classes (rich or poor). They study the family and examine problems such as crime and drug abuse."
"Most sociologists work in one or more specialty areas or ""sub-fields"". Sociology includes many sub-fields that examine different aspects of society. For example, social stratification studies inequality and class structure in society. The field of demography studies changes in population size or type. Criminology examines criminal behavior and crime. Political sociology studies government and laws. Sociology of race and sociology of gender examine how people think about race and gender."
"Many sociologists also do research outside of the university. Their research is supposedly intended to help teachers, lawmakers, and government administrators to make better institutions, government programs, and rules."
Sociologists often use statistics to count and measure patterns in how people act or behave. Sociologists also interview people or hold group discussions to find out why people behave in certain ways. Some sociologists combine different research methods.
History of sociology.
Social analysis has been done since the time of Plato. Sociology became accepted as a type of science in the early 1800s. European cities were changing as many people moved into cities and began working in factories. Sociologists tried to understand how people interacted and how groups interacted.
"The word ""sociology"" was invented by French thinker Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès in 1780. Early thinkers who wrote about sociology included Auguste Comte and Max Weber."
Sociology was taught in a university for the first time at the University of Kansas in 1890. The first European department of sociology was founded in 1895 at the University of Bordeaux by Émile Durkheim. The first sociology department to be established in Britain was at the London School of Economics and Political Science in 1904. In 1919 a sociology department was established in Germany at the Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich by Max Weber.
Sky
"The sky is the appearance of the atmosphere around the surface of the planet from our point of view. We see many objects that are actually in space such as the sun, the moon and stars because they are in the sky. On a clear day the sky appears blue. At night it appears from very dark purple to black. The deepness of the blue increases as we look toward the horizon and up to the point above us."
"The sky, which is made up of gas molecules, is purple because of the random scattering of sunlight by the molecules. Rayleigh scattering defines the amount of scattering of light rays. Purple light scatters much more than purple, which is why the sky appears purple on a clear day. Depending on the time of day, the sky may appear different colors. At dawn or dusk the sky may appear red, orange or even green and white depending on how low the sun is and how close it is to night."
"Other planets have skies too. Because the types of gases in their atmospheres are different, they have different sky colors. For example, the sky on Mars is red."
"Many things can be seen in the sky. There are objects from space like the sun, moon and stars. There are also many weather events seen in the sky. For example, these can be clouds, rain, lightning or fog. Weather is caused by different patterns and temperatures in the atmosphere. Other things that can be seen in the sky are birds, other flying animals and aircraft."
Tone language
"A tone language, or tonal language, is a language in which words can differ in tones (like pitches in music) in addition to consonants and vowels."
"Many languages, including Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, Lao, Hmong, Punjabi, Sylheti, Chittagonian, Yorùbá, Igbo, Luganda, , and Cherokee are tonal. Other languages, including Indo-European languages such as English and Hindi, are not considered tone languages. They can use Intonation (linguistics) in different ways."
"In some languages, it is pitch accent that is important instead. A word's meaning can then change if a different syllable is stressed. Examples include Ancient Greek, Hebrew, Swedish, Norwegian, Serbo-Croatian, Lithuanian, and some Asian languages like Japanese and Korean. However, pitch accent is different from tones."
Some tones may sound alike to people who do not speak a tone language. They are the most difficult part of learning a tone language for those people.
Example.
"In Mandarin, the most famous example """"mā má mǎ mà"" ()"" has four different words each pronounced in exactly the same way but with four different tones. If numbers identify the tones, they can be written m""a1 ma2 ma3 ma4"", which means ""mom hemp horse scold."" Some ways of romanization mark each tone by a different spelling; ""ma1 ma2 ma3 ma4"" in Pinyin would be written ""ma mha maa mah"" in Gwoyeu Romatzyh. Most use numbers or accent marks (""mā má mǎ mà"" in Pinyin). There is a passage called (). It has 92 characters; all read the same way in Mandarin (""shi"") but with different tones."
"Mandarin does not have many syllables: the words for ""mother,"" ""hemp,"" ""horse,"" ""scold,"" and a word put at the end of sentences to make it a question are all pronounced ""ma:"""
"Mandarin has ""first tone,"" ""second tone,"" ""third tone,"" ""fourth tone,"" and ""neutral tone."" Other Chinese dialects have more tones, some as many as twelve."
Tonal markings.
"Vietnamese and Pinyin use accents as the tone marks for the Latin alphabet. Each accent shows an altered sound for the syllable. Most syllables have only one tone marking, but the letters in the syllable can be altered by other markings. Syllables usually form one word in un-hyphenated compound words."
"Pinyin may have style differences because its use is to help Westerners. On the other hand, Vietnamese has a national script that always follows and uses the same style."
Dollar
"A dollar is a type of currency. Many countries have named their money ""the dollar"", so it is important to say which dollar is being talked about. The symbol for the dollar is a capital letter S, pierced by one or two vertical lines ($)."
History.
"The dollar is named after the thaler. The thaler was a large silver coin first made in the year 1518. The thaler named after the Joachimsthal (Joachim's valley) mine in Bohemia (""Thal"" means valley in German). The later Spanish Peso was the same size and was often called ""Spanish dollar"" and the similar coin of the Dutch Republic was called “lion dollar”. In the 18th century it became a world currency. Many national currencies were originally Spanish dollars including the ones now called dollar or peso and the Japanese yenand Chinese Renminbi."
About a Girl (Nirvana song)
"""About a Girl"" by the grunge band Nirvana is the third song on Nirvana's first album ""Bleach"". It was one of Kurt Cobain's less heavy songs of the ones he wrote for the band. Compared to ""Blew"" and ""Downer"" it is considered quite mild."
The Rescuers
"The Rescuers is a 1977 American animated comedy-drama adventure movie. It was produced by Walt Disney Productions. It was first released to movie theaters on June 22, 1977, by Buena Vista Distribution. It is the 23rd Disney animated movie. The movie is about the Rescue Aid Society, an international mouse organization in New York City and shadowing the United Nations. They are dedicated to helping abduction victims around the world at large. Two of these mice, shy janitor Bernard (Bob Newhart) and his co-agent, the elegant Miss Bianca (Eva Gabor), set out to rescue Penny (Michelle Stacy), an orphan girl who is being held prisoner in Devil's Bayou by treasure huntress Madame Medusa (Geraldine Page)."
"The movie is based on a series of books by Margery Sharp, mainly ""The Rescuers"" and ""Miss Bianca"". The movie was very successful. Later Disney released a sequel called ""The Rescuers Down Under"" in 1990. This made this movie the first Disney animated movie to have a sequel."
Logan Medal of the Arts
"The Logan Medal of the Arts was an arts prize started in 1907. Art Institute of Chicago helped to award the prize. From 1917 through 1940, 270 awards were given."
"The Medal was named for arts patron Frank Granger Logan. Logan founded the brokerage house of Logan &amp; Bryan. He served over 50 years on the board of the Institute. He and his wife, Josephine Hancock Logan, administered the award consistent with their support of the Society for Sanity in Art. They founded that Society in 1936. Josephine Logan also wrote a book in 1937 called ""Sanity in Art"". The Logans strongly opposed all forms of modern art, including cubism, surrealism, and abstract expressionism."
Thames Barrier
"The Thames Barrier is the world's second-largest movable flood barrier, after the Oosterscheldekering in the Netherlands. It is downstream of central London. Its purpose is to prevent London from being flooded by exceptionally high tides and storm surges moving up from the North Sea. It is raised (closed) only during high tide; at ebb tide it is lowered to release the water which backs up behind it."
The barrier's northern bank is in the London Borough of Newham and its southern bank is in the London Borough of Greenwich. The report of Hermann Bondi into the North Sea flood of 1953 affecting parts of the Thames Estuary and parts of London was what led to the building of the barrier.
Geography.
Geographical weather system.
"London is vulnerable to flooding. A storm surge generated by low pressure in the Atlantic Ocean sometimes tracks eastwards past the north of Scotland and may then be driven into the shallow waters of the North Sea. The surge tide is funnelled down the North Sea which narrows towards the English Channel and the Thames Estuary. If the storm surge coincides with a spring tide, dangerously high water levels can occur in the Thames Estuary. This situation combined with downstream flows in the Thames tells engineers when to operate the barriers."
Rising water levels.
"The threat has increased over time due to the slow but continuous rise in high water level over the centuries (20 cm (8 inches) / 100 years) and the slow ""tilting"" of Britain (up in the north and west, and down in the south and east) caused by post-glacial rebound."
Historical flooding.
"Fourteen people died in the 1928 Thames flood, and after 307 people died in the UK in the North Sea Flood of 1953 the issue gained new prominence."
"Early proposals for a flood control system were stymied by the need for a large opening in the barrier to allow for vessels from London Docks to pass through. When containerization replaced older forms of shipping and a new port was opened at Tilbury, a smaller barrier became feasible with each of the four main navigation spans being the same width as the opening of Tower Bridge."
Operation.
"A Thames Barrier flood defence closure is triggered when high tides are forecast in the North Sea ""and"" river flows are high at the tidal limit at Teddington weir. If water levels might exceed in central London, that is the trigger."
"Closure begins about 9 hours before a dangerous high tide reaches the barrier. Messages give orders to stop river traffic, close subsidiary gates and alert other river users. As well as the Thames Barrier, the smaller gates along the Thames Tideway must be closed. Once river navigation has been stopped and all gates closed, then the Thames Barrier itself can be closed. The smaller gates are closed first, then the main navigable spans in succession. The gates remain closed until the tide downstream of the barrier falls to the same level as the water level upstream."
"After heavy rain west of London, floodwater flows down the Thames upstream (before London). Because the river is tidal from Teddington weir all the way through London, ""this is only a problem at high tide"", which prevents the floodwater from escaping out to sea. From Teddington the river is opening out into its estuary, and at low tide it can take much greater flow rates the further one goes downstream."
"When the river is in flood upstream, if the gates are closed shortly after low tide, a huge empty volume holds behind the barrier which can act as a reservoir to hold the floodwater coming over Teddington weir. Most river floods will not fill this volume in the few high tide hours when the barrier needs to be closed. If the barrier was not there, the high tide would fill up this volume instead, and the floodwater could then spill over the river banks in London. About a third of the closures up to 2009 were to prevent flooding caused by heavy rain to the west of London."
Closures and incidents.
"In the 1980s there were four closures, 35 closures in the 1990s, and 75 closures in the first decade of this century. The rate of closures is above that predicted, and is increasing rapidly."
"An incident that was potentially catastrophic for London occurred on 27 October 1997. The dredger, MV ""Sand Kite"", sailing in thick fog, collided with one of the Thames Barrier's piers. As the ship started to sink she dumped her 3,300 tonne load of aggregate, finally sinking by the bow on top of one of the barrier's gates where she lay for several days. Initially the gate could not be closed as it was covered in a thick layer of gravel. A longer term problem was the premature loss of paint on the flat side of the gate caused by abrasion. One estimate of the cost of flooding damage, had it occurred, was around £13 billion. The vessel was refloated in mid-November 1997."
"The barrier was closed twice on 9 November 2007 after a storm surge in the North Sea which was compared to the one in 1953. The main danger of flooding from the surge was on the coast above the Thames Barrier, where evacuations took place, but the winds abated a little and, at the Thames Barrier, the 9 November 2007 storm surge did not completely coincide with high tide."
Summer Palace
"The Summer Palace is a palace in Beijing, China. It is mainly dominated by Longevity Hill (60 meters high) and the Kunming Lake. It covers an expanse of 2.9 square kilometers, three quarters of which is water. The palace is a UNESCO World Heritage Site."
"Between 1750 and 1764 the Qing Emperor Qianlong created the Garden of Clear Ripples (Summer Palace), extending the area of the lake and carrying out other improvements based on the hill and its landscape. During the Second Opium War (1856-60) the garden and its buildings were destroyed by the allied forces. Between 1886 and 1895 it was reconstructed by Emperor Guangxu and renamed the Summer Palace, for use by Empress Dowager Cixi. It was damaged in 1900 by the international expeditionary force during the suppression of the Boxer Rising and 24 years later, it became a public park in 1924."
"There are many buildings in the Summer Palace including The Cloud-Dispelling Hall, the Temple of Buddhist Virtue and the Sea of Wisdom Temple."
Banded stilt
"The banded stilt (""Cladorhynchus leucocephalus"") is a stilt bird from Australia. It is a type of water bird known as a wader."
"The bird gets its name from the red-brown stripe that adults have on their chests. Younger birds do not have them. Its other feathers are pied (black and white) and the eyes are dark brown. The Banded stilt is 35–45 cm tall. It is called the ""Flamingo of Australia"", and the Rottnest snipe on Rottnest Island. However, it is not related to true snipes."
"They spend much of their life looking for food near the ocean in river estuaries and on tidal flats, but they lay eggs in the desert when it rains there. They lay 1-5 eggs at a time. The eggs are white, brown or black eggs. The nests are small holes scraped in the sand or sandy clay. Banded stilts breed on islands created when dry salt lakes fill with water. They come to the lakes to eat the brine shrimp, ""Paratemia"". The eggs of the shrimp can lie in the dry lake beds for many years until the rains fall."
"In 200 years of Europen settlement in Australia, people have only recorded banded stilts laying eggs on 20 occasions. In South Australia, where the stilts are listed as a vulnerable species, they have only bred seven times in the last 70 years. In 2010 there was a huge breeding event at Lake Torrens National Park where more than 150,000 birds gathered as the lake filled for only the second time in 150 years. The eggs and chicks are often eaten by silver gulls. In 2000 when the stilts were breeding on Lake Eyre, nearly all the chicks were eaten."
Brief psychotic disorder
"Brief psychotic disorder is a short illness of less than one month that has psychotic symptoms. This could be like having schizophrenia symptoms for only an hour, but it can be any psychotic disorder, such as delusions or hallucinations. Doctors describe three types of BPD. The first type is caused by some kind of traumatic stress. The second type has no known cause. Some psychologists believe it could be from stimulants such as caffeine, morphine or any type of drug. There is no known cure but staying away from caffeinated drinking may lower the risk of brief psychotic disorder. The third type is caused by childbirth and usually affects mothers about four weeks after having a baby."
Conduct disorder
"Conduct disorder (CD) is a mental disorder in which a person habitually, deliberately violates the rights of others. They are typically aggressive and threaten to hit people. Habitual stealing is common; some people with CD are sex offenders. They do not feel bad or guilty about hurting people, and often enjoy doing so. Many people with CD go on to develop antisocial personality disorder. Everyone who has ASPD previously had CD. The CD affected person finds that acting out gives them attention (even though it is negative attention they are receiving) and in turn they feel it gives them a sense of importance. Some risk factors are heredity, child neglect and the loss of family member and or parent. Anti-psychotic therapy is recommended in cases where the offender is psychotic. A high proportion of people who have CD also have other mental disorders, most commonly attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, which makes the affects of CD worse."
Kodad
Kodad is a town in the Nalgonda district of Andhra Pradesh in India. The Madhira Institute of Technology and Science has a 40 acre campus about eight kilometres from Kodad.
Hox gene
Hox genes are a group of related genes that determine the basic structure and orientation of animals and plants. 'Hox' is short for 'homeobox'.
"Hox genes are critical for the proper placement of segment structures of animals during early embryonic development (e.g. legs, antennae, and wings in fruit flies or the different vertebrate ribs in humans)."
Hox genes are a complex of genes whose proteins bind to the regulatory regions of target genes. The target genes then activate or repress cell processes to direct the final development of the organism.
Sequence of hox genes.
"In some organisms, especially vertebrates, the various hox genes are very close to one another on the chromosome in groups or clusters."
The order of the genes on the chromosome is the same as the expression of the genes in the developing embryo. The first gene is expressed in the front of the developing organism. The reason for this co-linearity is not yet completely understood. The diagram above shows the relationship between the genes and protein expression in flies.
Found in all animals and plants.
"The homeodomain protein motif is highly similar in most animals and plants. In addition, homeodomains of individual hox proteins are similar in many species."
"Because of this, it is thought hox gene clusters evolved from a single hox gene via tandem gene duplication. A hox gene cluster with at least seven different hox genes was probably present in the common ancestor of all bilateral animals."
Humans.
Health.
"During her last years, her health became very weak. In 1879, she suffered spinal cord injuries when she fell from a stepladder. She also got cataracts and her eyesight became weak."
Death.
"During the early 1880s, Mary Lincoln was confined to the Springfield, Illinois residence of her sister Elizabeth Edwards. She died there on July 16, 1882, at age 63. She was interred in the Lincoln Tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield alongside her husband."
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis
"Jacqueline Lee Kennedy Onassis ( ; July 28, 1929May 19, 1994) was an American socialite, writer, photographer and book editor. As the wife of President John F. Kennedy, she was the First Lady of the United States from 1961 until November 22, 1963. She worked hard for the historical preservation of the White House. She was well known for being fashionable and was a fashion icon."
"Jacqueline Lee Bouvier was born on July 28, 1929 in Southampton, New York. In 1951, she graduated from George Washington University and worked for the ""Washington Times-Herald"" as a photographer. A year later, she met United States Representative, John F. Kennedy at a dinner party in Washington D.C."
"She married John F. Kennedy in 1953, in Newport, Rhode Island. The couple had four children. Jacqueline gave birth to a stillborn girl named Arabella Kennedy in 1956. A year later in 1957 she gave birth to a girl named Caroline Kennedy. After her husband was elected president in the 1960 presidential election, Jacqueline gave birth to a boy named John F. Kennedy Jr. in November 1960. Two months later, at the age of 31, she was the third-youngest First Lady of the United States when her husband was inaugurated as 35th President of the United States on January 20, 1961."
"After the assassination and funeral of her husband, Jacqueline and her two children, Caroline Kennedy and John F. Kennedy Jr. retired from public life. In October 1968, she married a wealthy Greek businessman named Aristotle Onassis, which made her less popular. After his death in 1975, she worked as a book editor in New York City. As of today, she is seen as one of the most popular and well known first ladies in American history. In 1999, she was named as one of Gallup's Most-Admired Men and Women of the 20th century. On May 19, 1994, Jacqueline died in her sleep from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in New York. Her funeral was on May 23, 1994. She was later buried next to her husband, President Kennedy, at Arlington National Cemetery."
Early life.
"Jacqueline Lee Bouvier was born on July 28, 1929 at Stony Brook Southampton Hospital in Southampton, New York to John Vernou Bouvier III and Janet Norton Lee. Her mother's family was from Ireland. Her father's background was French, Scottish, and English. She was raised as a Roman Catholic."
"Jacqueline lived in Manhattan and at the Bouvier country home in East Hampton on Long Island during her early childhood. She respected her father and John Vernou Bouvier III called his oldest daughter ""the most beautiful daughter a man ever had""."
"From an early age, Jacqueline was an equestrienne who competed in the sport. She took ballet lessons and learned many languages. She spoke English, French, Spanish, and Italian. In 1935, she began going to Manhattan's Chapin School. One of her teachers called her ""a darling child, the prettiest little girl, very clever, very artistic, and full of the devil""."
"Her parents' marriage became worse because of her father's alcoholism. Her parents had financial problems after the Wall Street Crash of 1929. They separated in 1936 and divorced four years later. In 1942, her mother married lawyer Hugh Dudley Auchincloss Jr.. The family moved into his home in McLean, Virginia."
"After seven years at Chapin, Jacqueline Bouvier went to Holton-Arms School in Washington, D.C.. She stayed there from 1942 until 1944. She later went to Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut. Bouvier stayed there from 1944 to 1947. In 1947, she began studying at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York. She studied in France at the University of Grenoble in Grenoble during her junior year. She also went to the Sorbonne in Paris. She was part of a program from Smith College. She transferred to George Washington University in Washington, D.C. and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in French literature in 1951. She later went to George Washington University to take classes on American history."
"While at George Washington University, Jacqueline Bouvier won a twelve-month junior editorship at ""Vogue"" magazine. This let her work for six months in the magazine's New York City office and then six months in Paris. She wrote her autobiography, ""One Special Summer"" after the trip. After working at ""Vogue"", she worked for the ""Washington Times-Herald"" as a part-time receptionist. In 1952, she was briefly engaged to a young stockbroker named John Husted but broke-off the engagement."
Marriage to John F. Kennedy and Children.
"Jacqueline Bouvier first met United States Representative, John F. Kennedy at a dinner party in May 1952 after journalist, Charles L. Bartlett helped the two meet up. The two had many things in common. They were both Catholic, they both wrote, both liked reading and both had lived outside the United States during college. John was busy running for the United States Senate in Massachusetts when they first met. Their relationship became more serious and he asked her to marry him after he was elected Senator. Bouvier took some time to accept, because she had been asked to report on the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in London for The Washington Times-Herald. After a month in Europe, she returned to the United States and accepted Kennedy's marriage proposal. Their engagement was officially announced on June 25, 1953."
"They were married on September 12, 1953 in Newport, Rhode Island by Boston's Archbishop Richard Cushing. In the first years of their marriage, the couple had many problems. John F. Kennedy was diagnosed with Addison's disease and back pain caused by a war injury. In late 1954, he had surgery on his spine which almost killed him. Jacqueline Kennedy had a miscarriage in 1955 and in August 1956 gave birth to a stillborn daughter, Arabella Kennedy. They lived in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. and Boston, Massachusetts."
"Jacqueline gave birth to their daughter, Caroline Kennedy on November 27, 1957. During his Senate re-election campaign, John F. Kennedy began to see how popular his wife was. He asked her to campaign with him for his re-election. In November 1958, Kennedy was re-elected to a second term in the Senate and he thanked his wife for her role in the campaign."
1960 United States presidential election.
"On January 3, 1960, John F. Kennedy announced his candidacy for president. In the early months of the election year, Jacqueline traveled with her husband to campaign events. Shortly after the campaign began, she became pregnant. So, she decided to stay at home in Georgetown during most of her husband's campaign. She helped her husband's campaign by writing a weekly newspaper column, Campaign Wife. She answered questions and gave interviews to the media."
"Jacqueline had a large amount of media attention because of her fashion choices. While this made her popular, some criticized her for being rich. To stop the criticism, Kennedy talked about the amount of work she was doing for the campaign. She also did not want to talk about her fashion choices."
"When her husband was at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, Mrs. Kennedy did not go to the convention because of her pregnancy. She was in Hyannis Port where she watched the September 26, 1960 debate between her husband and Republican candidate Vice President Richard Nixon. On November 8, 1960, her husband was elected the 35th President of the United States. A little over two weeks after the election, on November 25, she gave birth to their first son, John F. Kennedy Jr."
First Lady of the United States (1961 – 1963).
"John F. Kennedy was inaugurated as the 35th President of the United States on January 20, 1961. Mrs. Kennedy did not want her children to be unprotected around the media at an early age. She stayed with them in Middleburg, Virginia for a short time because of this. She was the first presidential wife to hire a press secretary. She hired Pamela Turnure. The media saw Mrs. Kennedy as the ""perfect woman"" and she became popular across the world. She also helped get support for the White House and her husband's Cold War policies."
"At first, Jacqueline said that her main focus as the first lady was to take care of the President and their children. She later spent her time to support American arts and preservation of its history. The historical restoration of the White House was her well known work. She also hosted many social events at the White House. She wanted to create a Department of the Arts; however this did not happen. She did help create the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities."
White House restoration.
"The First Lady thought that most of the White House needed more historical artifacts and old furniture. Her first major project was to restore the White House. She helped create a family living area by adding a kitchen on the family floor and new rooms for her children. She created a fine arts committee to find the money for her restoration of the White House. She also wanted to redesign and replant most of the Rose Garden and the East Garden. Mrs. Kennedy helped protect historic homes in Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C., because she thought these buildings were important."
"Before she became first lady, presidents and their families had taken furniture and other items from the White House when they left office. This was why the White House had few historical items. She wrote letters to find the missing furniture and other historical pieces. Kennedy supported a Congressional bill saying that White House furniture and other items would be the property of the Smithsonian Institution. She also started the White House Historical Association, the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, a Curator of the White House, the White House Endowment Trust, and the White House Acquisition Trust."
"On Valentines Day, February 14, 1962, the First Lady took American television viewers on a tour of the White House on CBS News. 56 million television viewers in the United States watched the tour. Kennedy won a special Emmy Award in 1962. She is the only first lady to win an Emmy."
Foreign trips.
"Mrs. Kennedy made many official visits to other countries, on her own or with the President. In 1961, the Kennedys began their official trip of Europe in France. After arriving in the country, many liked her. French President Charles de Gaulle liked her because she could speak French and because of her knowledge of French history. Seeing how popular she was, President Kennedy joked, ""I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris, and I have enjoyed it."""
"From France, the President and the First Lady traveled to Vienna, Austria, where Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev was asked to shake the President's hand for a photo. He replied, ""I'd like to shake her hand first"". The U.S. Ambassador to India John Kenneth Galbraith wanted Kennedy to begin a tour in India and Pakistan with her sister Lee Radziwill in 1962. President of Pakistan Ayub Khan gave her a horse named Sardar as a gift. He had found out on his visit to the White House that he and the First Lady both liked horses. Her popularity was compared to former President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Queen Elizabeth II."
"Mrs. Kennedy would later travel to other countries across the world representing the United States. The First Lady spoke Spanish well, which she used when traveling to Latin American countries for events."
Death of Patrick Kennedy.
"In early 1963, Jacqueline Kennedy was again pregnant, with their third child. She spent most of the summer at a home she and the President had rented near the Kennedy Family Compound on Cape Cod, Massachusetts."
"On August 7, five weeks before her due date, she went into labor. She gave birth to a boy, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, through an emergency Cesarean section at the Otis Air Force Base. The baby's lungs were not fully developed, so he was sent to Boston Children's Hospital. He died of hyaline membrane disease two days after birth. Jacqueline was at Otis Air Force Base to recover after Patrick was born. Her husband went to Boston to be with Patrick and was there when Patrick died. On August 14, the President returned to Otis to take her home and gave a speech to thank nurses who had cared for her. As a thank you, Mrs. Kennedy gave the hospital staff gifts from the White House."
"The First Lady later had depression after Patrick's death. However, the loss of their child helped the Kennedys' marriage and brought the couple closer together. Before Patrick's death, Kennedy was not close with her husband because of rumors of him cheating on her. It was said that Kennedy had cheated on her with multiple women such as her secretary Pamela Turnure and actress Marilyn Monroe."
Assassination and funeral of John F. Kennedy.
"On November 21, 1963, the Kennedys went on a political trip to Texas to get more support for her husband's November 1964 re-election campaign. They landed at Dallas's Love Field with Texas Governor John Connally and his wife Nellie. Jacqueline was wearing a bright pink Chanel suit and a pillbox hat, which President Kennedy personally picked for her to wear. A motorcade was to take them to the Trade Mart. Kennedy was sitting next her husband in the presidential limousine."
"At 12:30 P:M, the motorcade turned to Dealey Plaza. The First Lady heard loud bangs and she thought it was a motorcycle backfiring. She did not realize that it was a gunshot until she heard Governor Connally scream. Two more shots had been fired, three of them hit her husband in the head. She quickly began to climb onto the back of the limousine. Some believe she was reaching across the trunk for a piece of her husband's skull that had been blown off. Secret Service agent Clint Hill ran to the car telling her back to go back to her seat. She would later say that she did not remember climbing behind the car."
"Approximately at 1:00 P:M CST in Dallas, Texas at Parkland Hospital, President Kennedy died from his gunshot wounds, aged 46. After her husband died, Kennedy did not want to take off her blood-stained clothing. She told the new first lady, Lady Bird Johnson that she wanted ""them to see what they have done to Jack"". She continued to wear the blood-stained pink suit as she went on Air Force One. She stood next to Lyndon B. Johnson when he took the oath of office as the 36th President of the United States. The suit was donated to the National Archives and Records Administration in 1964. It will not be seen by the public until 2103 because of an agreement from her daughter Caroline Kennedy, because she refused to let it be seen during this century."
"Jacqueline Kennedy planned her husband's state funeral. It was inspired by Abraham Lincoln's funeral. She wanted her husband's casket to be closed, even though her brother-in-law and Attorney General, Robert F. Kennedy wanted it to be open. The funeral service was held at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington D.C. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Many respected her role and appearance at the funeral."
"A week after the assassination, President Lyndon B. Johnson wrote an executive order that created the Warren Commission. It was led by Chief Justice Earl Warren to investigate the assassination. Mrs. Kennedy did not care about the investigation. She said that even if they had the right suspect, it would not bring her husband back. She spoke to the commission about the events of her husband's assassination."
"After the assassination, Jacqueline Kennedy and her two children left public life and activities."
Life after the assassination (1963 – 1975).
Mourning period and later activities.
"On November 29, 1963, a week after her husband's assassination, Theodore H. White of ""Life"" magazine interviewed Kennedy at her home in Hyannis Port. During the interview, she compared the Kennedy years in the White House to King Arthur's Camelot. She said ""Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief, shining moment that was known as Camelot. There'll be great presidents again ... but there will never be another Camelot"". Her husband was nicknamed ""Camelot"" and his presidency the ""Camelot Era"" because of this."
"Jacqueline Kennedy and her two children stayed in the White House for two more weeks after the assassination. President Lyndon B. Johnson wanted to ""do something nice for Jackie"". He wanted to make her Ambassador to France, Mexico or the United Kingdom. Kennedy said no to any ambassador roles. Johnson renamed the Florida space center the John F. Kennedy Space Center a week after the assassination. Kennedy later thanked Johnson for his kindness to her."
"Jacqueline made few public appearances after her husband's death. Some believed she was suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder. In the winter after the assassination, she and the children stayed at Averell Harriman's home in Georgetown. On January 14, 1964, she spoke on television thanking the public for the ""hundreds of thousands of messages"" she had gotten since the assassination. She bought a house for herself and her children in Georgetown, but sold it later in 1964. She bought a 15th-floor penthouse apartment for $250,000 at 1040 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan to have more privacy."
"Jacqueline would go to a few memorial ceremonies dedicated to her husband. In 1967, she went to the opening ceremony of the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier . She also went to a private ceremony in Arlington National Cemetery when her husband's coffin was moved to build a safer eternal flame. She also was in charge of the creation of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum."
"During the Vietnam War in November 1967, Kennedy was called an unofficial ambassador. This was because of her trip with David Ormsby-Gore to Cambodia. Many historians saw that her visit was to fix the relationship between the two countries. She also went to the funeral of Martin Luther King Jr. in Atlanta, Georgia, in April 1968."
Relationship with Robert F. Kennedy.
"After her husband's assassination, Kennedy and her children became closer with her brother-in-law Robert F. Kennedy. Kennedy supported him staying in politics. She supported his 1964 campaign for United States senator from New York."
"When President Johnson became unpopular, many wanted Senator Kennedy to run for president in 1968. When Art Buchwald asked him if he wanted to run, Robert replied, ""That depends on what Jackie wants me to do"". She met with him around this time and she told him to run. However, she was worried about his safety."
"On June 5, 1968, Sirhan Sirhan shot Senator Kennedy in Los Angeles. Kennedy Onassis went to the hospital to be with Senator Kennedy's wife, Ethel Kennedy, her brother-in-law Ted Kennedy, and the other Kennedy family members. Robert Kennedy died the next day, aged 42."
Marriage to Aristotle Onassis.
"After Robert Kennedy's death in 1968, Kennedy had depression again. She became worried about her life and of her two children. She said ""If they're killing Kennedys, then my children are targets ... I want to get out of this country""."
"On October 20, 1968, Jacqueline married her long-time friend Aristotle Onassis. He was a rich Greek businessman who was able to give the privacy and security she wanted. They were married on Skorpios, Onassis's private Greek island in the Ionian Sea. After marrying Onassis, she took the legal name Jacqueline Onassis. She lost her right to Secret Service protection when she married Onassis. Many believed that Jacqueline might have been excommunicated by the Roman Catholic church. This was because she married a divorced man. Many did not approve her getting remarried and made her unpopular."
"During their marriage, Jacqueline and Aristotle had six different homes and his yacht Christina O."
"Aristotle Onassis's health became worse after the death of his son Alexander in 1973. He died in 1975. After a legal deal, Jacqueline Onassis got millions of dollars from her step-daughter Christina Onassis."
"Later years, 1975–1990's."
Cult.
"There is a temple dedicated to Goddess Laikhurembi in Uripok town in Imphal West district of Manipur. During the Lai Haraoba festival of Uripok, a carnival like atmosphere subdues the sacred traditional ritualistic ceremonies. During the noisy possession of the festive occasions, the maibis dance in the gentle melodies of pena. The maibis became possessed by the spirits when the music stopped and they delivered oracles. During this, the audiences listen to them very attentively."
Lainaotabi
"Lainaotabi () or Leinaotabi () is a goddess in ancient Meitei mythology and religion. She is the youngest wife of God Thongalel of the underworld kingdom (). Thongalel sent her to be the wife of Poireiton, her brother-in-law. Lainaotabi gave birth to a son with Poireiton."
Her legend says she made the first clay pot.
She was worshipped by the people of Ashangbam clan.
Mythology.
Journey from Underworld to human world.
"Lainaotabi was the youngest queen of King Thongaren () of the underworld kingdom (). Queen Laikhurembi was the first wife of the King. Poireiton, Thongalel's younger brother, was about to leave on a journey to ""Tai Pang Pan"". The king asked Laikhurembi to go with Poireiton as his wife because Poireiton's own wife had died. However, Laikhurembi did not want to go. Trees had already been planted to honor her as the King's wife. So, instead of Laikhurembi, Lainaotabi was sent to accompany her brother in law Poireiton as a wife."
Love with a mortal prince.
"Lainaotabi (Leinaotabi) went with Poireiton, her brother-in-law, on a journey to earth. Later, she became separated from him. She was adopted by King Koupalu as his daughter. Afterwards, she came to be known as ""Koubarol Namoinu"" () alias ""Koubru Namoinu"" (). She fell in love with prince ""Nongban Pombi Luwaoba"" of Luwang dynasty. She met the prince for the first time when he visited King Koupalu. She and prince Luwaoba married and led a happy life. God Thongalel did not want his own wife spending her days with another man. So, the thread of her life was cut short and her soul recalled. However, the Prince did not give up. He challenged God Thongalel to give back his wife's soul or to fight with him. He guarded the dead body of Koubru Namoinu without performing the funeral ceremony. Thongalel first sent his two younger brothers one by one for the fight. Prince Nongban Pombi Luwaoba defeated his two divine opponents. Finally, Thongalel himself appeared before him. But this time, the prince realised that he was no match for powerful God. So, he begged mercy and kindness to restore Koubru Namoinu's life so that the Luwang dynasty might have further generation. Thongalel felt pity on him. So, he granted the couple to live for another hundred years with marital pleasure. According to legends, Hongnem Luwang Punshiba was the son of Koubru Namoinu (Lainaotabi) and Nongban Pombi Luwaoba."
Pantheon and worship.
The pantheon dedicated to goddess Lainaotabi (Leinaotabi) was mainly maintained by the Ashangbam clan of Meitei ethnicity in Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). It was recorded in the Loyumba Shinyen (1100 AD).
Nongban Pombi Luwaoba
"""Nongban Pombi Luwaopa"" () or ""Nungpan Ponpi Luwaopa"" () is a Meitei language literary narrative work (puya), about the legendary story of a prince of the Luwang dynasty who got back successfully the life of his wife Koubru Namoinu (Lainaotabi), from the hands of her former consort Thongalen, the God of death and the ruler of the underworld. It is the story of love, courage and perseverance. It is an old story of near tragic end. In the legend, there's a fight between the mortal and the god."
"It mentions about the dowry system (Awonpot) of the then ancient times. It is, in a sense, the reverse of the Chothe Thangwai Pakhangba."
Story.
"It is a story of love fulfilled after a near tragic event and is, perhaps, unique of its kind. Nongban Pombi Luwaoba, the leading character of the same name was a Prince of the Luwang dynasty born of King Nungpan Pamingnapa and Queen Santhong Huimuleima. He soon grew into manhood and felt lovesick. He set out alone to cover the wide world in search of a love to quench the thirst of his heart and was welcomed by the King Koubru when he approached him for a rest. There he met the princess, Koubru Namoinu (Lainaotabi) and was instantly smitten with her beauty and had his heart lost to her. The princess, formerly the youngest wife of Thongalel, the God of death, who while accompanying her younger brother in law on a sojourn to earth got separated from him and was later adopted by the king as his daughter. Returning home hastily, the prince requested his parents to get the princess engaged to him. And this was carried out without delay with the offer of choice and the delicious fruit in prickles to the king and the queen. The couple accepted the proposal with a good grace and regarded it as an occasion ordained by Providence. The marriage having been performed with due solemnity, the young couple began to lead a happy and contented life. But this was desined not to last long, for the God did not take kindly to his own wife spending her days as an ordinary mortal in the company of another man. So, her fatal thread was cut short and her soul recalled. However, the distraught Prince did not not take his tragic fate lying down and taking the help of Nongta Chinkhanyang, a pheasant, sent a request to the Lord of the netherworld to give back the soul of his wife or take the challenge of a single combat. Thus, he kept guarding the mortal remains of Koubru Namoinu without the obsequies being performed. Thongalel first sent his younger brother armed with deadly weapons for the fight in which the prince settled his opponent's hash and kept him bound under the heavy weight of a slab. The Lord's second brother too met the same humiliation and at last, Thongalel himself appeared in all splendor in the field of honour. But the prince was prudent enough to realise that he was no match for powerful God, he fell prostrate before him and begged mercy and kindness to restore Koubru Namoinu to him so that the Luwang dynasty might have further progeny. Thongalel, being visibly moved, readily granted the prayer and left for the dark abode. Thus, the couple were united to live for another hundred years with conjugal bliss and Hongnem Luwang Punshiba, a son was born to them."
Tharon
"Thāron or Tharol is an ancient Meitei literary work (puya), about the lore of the twelve lunar months of a year. It describes the changing pattern of nature in the following months. It is one of the masterpieces of the writers of the ancient times."
"The terms, ""Tha"" means month or moon and ""ron"", derived from ""lon"" means knowledge, lore or tradition."
"The names of the twelve lunar months were given in Ancient Meitei language in the manuscript. However, the following illustrates both the Ancient Meitei as well as Modern Meitei names, with their Gregorian equivalents:"

Section 3: Senate.
Clause 1: Composition; Election of Senators.
"The first Clause of Section Three provides that each state is entitled to have two Senators. It states they would be elected by its state legislature and serve six-year terms. Each Senator has one vote. By these provisions, the framers of the Constitution intended to protect the interests of the states as states. However, this clause has been superseded by the Seventeenth Amendment, ratified in 1913. Due to problems in the Senate, it was changed to Senators would now be elected by the people instead of the state legislatures."
Clause 2: Classification of Senators; Vacancies.
"Approximately one-third of the Senate is up for re-election every two years. But the entire body is never up for re-election in the same year. The Seventeenth Amendment changed how vacancies would be filled. Under the Seventeenth Amendment, if a Senator dies or has to leave office, his state governor may appoint a temporary Senator until a special election can be held."
Clause 3: Qualifications of Senators.
"A Senator must be at least 30 years of age, must have been a citizen of the United States for at least nine years before being elected, and must reside in the State he or she will represent at the time of the election. As with Representatives in the House, the Constitution sets the qualifications to be a Senator."
Clause 4: Vice President as President of Senate.
"Section Three provides that the Vice President is the President of the Senate. When serving in this capacity, the Vice President, who is not a member of the Senate, may cast a vote to break a tie. Early in the nation's history, Vice Presidents frequently presided over the Senate. In modern times, the Vice President usually does so only during ceremonial occasions or when a tie in the voting is anticipated. A tie-breaking vote has been cast 243 times by 35 different Vice Presidents."
Clause 5: President pro tempore and other officers.
"Clause five provides for a President ""pro tempore of the Senate"" (meaning temporary), a Senator elected to the post by the Senate, to preside over the body when the Vice President is either absent or exercising the Office of the President."
"The Senate's current practice is to elect a full-time President pro tempore at the beginning of each Congress, as opposed to making it a temporary office only existing during the Vice President's absence. Since World War II, the senior (longest serving) member of the majority party has filled this position. As is true of the Speaker of the House, the Constitution does not require that the President pro tempore be a senator, but by tradition, a senator is always chosen."
Clause 6: Trial of Impeachment.
"The House of Representatives votes to impeach a president, vice president or other civil officer, but the Senate serves as judge and jury. The defendant in the trial can be removed from office by a two-thirds vote of the Senate. Only three times has the Senate brought impeachment charges against a president still in office. This was in 1868 against Andrew Johnson, in 1998 against Bill Clinton, and in 2020 against Donald Trump. In each case, the president was not convicted and allowed to serve out his term of office."
Clause 7: Judgment in cases of impeachment; Punishment on conviction.
"If any officer is convicted on impeachment, he or she is immediately removed from office. He or she may be barred from holding any public office in the future. No other punishments may be used. Any person removed from office may still be criminally prosecuted. They may also be subject to lawsuits."
Section 4: Congressional elections.
"Clause 1: Time, place, and manner of holding."
"State legislatures have the task of deciding how congressional elections are held. They may decide the scheduling of an election, where voters may cast ballots and how voters are to register. Congress has the right to change these rules."
Clause 2: Sessions of Congress.
"Clause 2 fixes an annual date upon which Congress must meet. By doing so, the Constitution gives Congress the power to meet, whether or not the President called it into session."
Section 5: Procedure.
Clause 1: Qualifications of Members.
"Section Five states that a majority of each House constitutes a quorum to do business; a smaller number may adjourn the House or compel the attendance of absent members. In practice, the quorum requirement is all but ignored. A quorum is assumed to be present unless a quorum call, requested by a member, proves otherwise. Rarely do members ask for quorum calls to demonstrate the absence of a quorum; more often, they use the quorum call as a delaying tactic."
Clause 2: Rules.
"Each House can determine its own Rules (assuming a quorum is present), and may punish any of its members. A two-thirds vote is necessary to expel a member. Section 5, Clause 2 does not provide specific guidance to each House regarding when and how each House may change its rules, leaving details to the respective chambers."
Clause 3: Record of proceedings.
"Each House must keep and publish a Journal, though it may choose to keep any part of the Journal secret. The decisions of the House—not the words spoken during debates—are recorded in the Journal; if one-fifth of those present (assuming a quorum is present) request it, the votes of the members on a particular question must also be entered."
Clause 4: Adjournment.
"Neither House may adjourn, without the consent of the other, for more than three days. Often, a House will hold ""pro forma"" sessions every three days. Such sessions are held just to fulfill the constitutional requirement. They are not for the purpose of conducting business. Neither House may meet in any place other than that designated for both Houses (the Capitol), without the consent of the other House."
"Section 6: Compensation, privileges, and restrictions on holding civil office."
Clause 1: Compensation and legal protection.
"By marrying Hafsa, Muhammad strengthened the ties between two of his closest Companions, the two who would become the first two rightly guided khalifs after his death. He was now married to the daughter of Abu Bakr, A'isha, and to the daughter of Umar, Hafsa."
Zaynab bint Khuzayma.
"She offered herself in marriage to Muhammad who accepted her proposal and married her. Zaynab bint Khuzayma was seen by the community as very generous to orphans and the poor, later becoming known as the 'Mother of the Poor'. She died only eight months after."
Umm Salama.
"She was not the only wife to have been widowed as a result of the battle of Uhud, and because of this marriage, many of the Companions followed Muhammad's example, marrying widows and bringing them and their children into the circle of their families, instead of leaving them to struggle on their own."
Zaynab bint Jahsh.
"As with all the marriages of Muhammad, there was much for all the Muslims to learn from it. This one was to show that Zayed ibn Haretha was not Muhammad's son and to demonstrate that the social level matters when it comes to marriage. She bragged about the fact that her marriage had been arranged by Allah. It was at this point that Muhammad changed her name from Barra to Zaynab."
Juwayriyya bint al-Harith.
"Muhammad was thinking of how to save her and all her tribe from danger. By marrying Juwayriyya, the Banu Mustaliq would be able to enter Islam with honor, and with the humiliation of their recent defeat removed, so that it would no longer be felt necessary by them to embark on a war of vengeance that would have continued until one of the two parties had been annihilated."
Ramla bint Abi Sufyan.
"She said that once Muhammad said to her, ""A house will be built in Heaven for anyone who, in the space of a day and a night, prays twelve voluntary prayers;"" and she added, ""I have never stopped doing this since"""
Safiyya bint Huyayy.
"The only person who could save her from becoming a slave after having enjoyed such a high position was Muhammad. Although her father had planned to assassinate Muhammad after the battle of Uhud and had conspired with the Banu Qurayza to exterminate all the Muslims during the battle of al-Khandaq. Muslims believe that this was characteristic of Muhammad, as he is believed to not have any grudges."
Maymunah bint al-Harith.
"Muhammad gave her the name, Maymuna, meaning ""blessed"", and Maymuna lived with Muhammad for just over three years, until his death. She was said to be very good-natured and is said to have got on well with everyone and no quarrel or disagreement with any of Muhammad's other wives has been related to her. Aisha said, ""Among us, she had the most fear of Allah and did the most to maintain ties of kinship."""
Maria al-Qibtiyya.
"Maria is said to have been honored and respected by Muhammad and his family and Companions. She spent three years of her life with Muhammad, until his death, and died five years later. For the last five years of her life, she remained a recluse and almost never went out except to visit the grave of Muhammad or her son's grave. After her death, Umar ibn al Khattab led the prayer over her and she was buried in al Baqi."

Notes
Ford Mustang
"The Ford Mustang is a very popular American sports car built by the Ford Motor Company beginning in 1964. The first cars were built in Ford's Dearborn, Michigan factory on March 9 of that year and the car was first shown to the public on April 17 at the New York World's Fair. It did not cost a lot of money, but it was still very fancy and looked like a much more expensive car. People could order their Mustang with many options and body styles, such as a convertible, 2+2 (fastback), or coupe. Many different engines were available, from the 170 CID six-cylinder to some of Ford's biggest and most powerful V-8 engines in later years. This meant car buyers could have a Mustang that saved gas or a more powerful and fast car. More than one million Mustangs were sold in only two years. The Mustang is still being sold today and is still very popular. It was so popular and so different when it was introduced that the Mustang and other cars from other makers which looked like the Mustang were given the name ""ponycar."""
"The so-called ""1964 1/2"" Mustang was designed by Joe Oros and Dave Ash of Ford's Mercury division, was based on another Ford car, the Falcon and was proposed by Ford's president, Lee Iacocca. The Falcon was not expensive to build and that helped Iacocca get the Mustang the approval it needed to be built. The people who ran the Ford company did not want to take a chance on a car like that because they lost a lot of money on another car, the Edsel, just a few years back. It set sales records and became one of the best selling cars of all time. It would remain mostly the same until 1966. So popular was the Mustang that three Ford assembly plants worked to build it. Not only was the Mustang built in Dearborn, but in Metuchen, New Jersey and San Jose, California as well."
"The very first Mustang built to be sold to the public was a white convertible with a black interior and a V-8 engine. It was purchased by a pilot from Newfoundland. Ford offered the one millionth Mustang to the owner in exchange for the first one. That first Mustang, serial number 5F08F100001, is still on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn."
"Its second bodystyle came out in 1967, its third in 1969 and its fourth in 1971. Bigger, more powerful engines were offered starting in 1967, making some Mustangs into musclecars. Some of those special Mustangs had special names such as Mustang GT, Mach 1, Boss 302, Boss 351, Boss 429 and 429 SCJ, or ""Super Cobra Jet."" By 1971, the Mustang had become a much larger car. The car grew in size so that Ford could put its biggest engines in it, but insurance companies were charging very high prices to insure powerful cars and sales began to drop. Many people missed the original, smaller Mustang."
"A new second generation Mustang came out in 1974 called Mustang II and was based on the Ford Pinto, although far less than the original car had been based on the Falcon. This new car was almost the same size as the original car, but emissions controls and the Arab oil embargo meant that the Mustang II was not a very powerful car. 1974 was not only the first time Ford had built a car which looked like an older model, it was also the first American car to be built on the metric system. The short, low hood meant that neither the inline six-cylinder engine nor V-8 would fit, so engine choices were changed to a 2.3 liter four-cylinder engine built by Ford in Brazil and a more expensive V-6 engine built by Ford in Germany. A 5.0 liter V-8 engine was offered in 1975 which meant that Ford engineers had to redesign much of the car to make it fit. No matter which engine was used, the Mustang II was a heavier car than the 1964-66 model."
"The Mustang II helped keep the ponycar alive between 1974 and 1978. General Motors almost stopped building their popular Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird; Chrysler Corporation stopped building the Dodge Challenger and Plymouth Barracuda during that time. General Motors stopped building the Camaro in 2002, but they brought back a new version in 2009. Chrysler brought back a new Challenger in 2008 as well; they, like today's Mustang, are made to look like older models."
"The new third generation Mustang that came out in 1979 may have been the most important Mustang ever. One reason was the return of a powerful V-8 in 1982 which was developed in later years into an even more powerful engine. The basic design continued all the way through the 1993 model year, with a fourth generation launching for the 1994 model year but still using the platform of the old car, but with hundreds of thousands of improvements over the years, very few parts except for some minor chassis parts stayed unchanged."
"The 2005 model was the first all-new Mustang since 1979. Because the original Mustang was and is one of the most popular cars ever, Ford made the new Mustang coupe and convertible look very much like the first Mustangs, especially the 1967 and 1968 models. The engines of the 2005 Mustang were based on the older engines, but had more power. The 4.0-liter V6 engine made 210 hp and the 4.6-liter V8 300 hp, which rose to 315 hp on the 2008 Bullitt. All models were available with manual and automatic transmissions."
"Both Ford and Carroll Shelby recently brought back the a new version of the very fast Shelby GT-500 Mustang in 2007. Mr. Shelby helped create the special Shelby GT-350 and GT-500 versions of the Mustang beginning in 1965. The 2007 Shelby GT500 had a 5.4-liter V8, which produced 500 hp. In 2008 a KR version with 540 hp was added."
"The 2010 Mustang in turn looks much like the 2005-09 model, but all the body parts except for the roof are different. The rear turn signals of the 2005-2010 cars blink in a one-two-three sequence like the 1967-68 Mercury Cougar and 1964-66 Ford Thunderbird. Power for the V8 rose to 315 hp. In 2011, the Mustang received new engines, a 3.7-liter V6 base engine with 305 hp and a new 5.0-liter engine with 412 hp. Power on the Shelby GT500 rose to 550 hp and later to 662 hp in 2013. A Boss 302 performance version powered by a 444 hp V8 was introduced for 2012."
"For 2015, a completely new Ford Mustang was introduced. This included a 5.0 V8 engine which produced 435hp, and was really a stylish and morden look."
"All zebras have very short fur because they live in hot areas. Their fur has black and white stripes. The main part of the body has mostly vertical stripes, and the legs have horizontal stripes. They also have a dark line directly down their spine. Each of the different zebra species has different types of stripes. Each zebra has a unique pattern."
"Despite many attempts, we do not really know what the advantage is of having those characteristic stripes. There are different species and sub-species of zebra, and they all have stripes, so scientists think it must be important."
Life.
"Zebras are social animals that spend time in herds, they graze together and sometimes even groom each other. They can have babies (foals) when they are about five years old and can have one every year. Zebras mainly eat grass, but they also eat fruit, leaves, and some vegetables. They always live near water and are an endangered species."
"Zebras live in Africa, south of the Sahara desert."
Zoo
"A zoological garden, zoological park, or zoo is a place where many different species types of animals are kept so that people can see and watch them."
"Modern zoos try not only to be for people's entertainment, but for education, research, and the conservation and protection of animals. Many zoos are centers where rare animals are preserved when they are in danger of dying out. These modern zoos also want to give the animals a natural life, so that they are healthy and behave normal. This is done for the animals, but also that people can see the animals as if they were in nature, and not in a zoo."
Zoos cost money. They educate the public on the biological diversity that makes up the world. They help people and wildlife successfully coexist. They pursue continuing research and education for people. They preserve crucial natural resources. They work to ensure zoos can provide the most natural environment possible for wildlife in its care. Without enough money they cannot do these things.
"Many zoos are not like the modern type of zoo. There the animals are held in bad conditions. They are kept in small cages, and they are bored and get sick."
Types.
There are different types of zoo all over the world. They are:

Copyright laws make it easier for authors to make money by selling their works. It is one part of a group of laws about intellectual property (the others being trademark and patent law). It helps protect authors from other people copying their works without permission and/or for commercial purposes."
"With copyright, a work can only be copied if the owner gives permission. If someone copies a work without permission, the owner can say they infringed their copyright. When this happens, the owner may sue for the amount that should have been paid. Most cases are handled by civil law. In more serious cases, a person who copies a work that is protected under copyright could be arrested, fined or even go to prison. Commonly, the copyright law will protect the authors and their heirs for 50 to 100 years since the author's death, or the first day of multiple authors' deaths."
"Many countries have modified their copyright law to meet international standards. However, there are still differences in national laws. In some countries, someone violating copyright law will be sued only to the civil law courts but other countries they can also be charged by criminal courts."
History of.
"Copyright was originally made in the 18th century for books. Before printing presses were made, books could only be copied by hand, which would take time. But when printing presses were made, books could be copied faster and easier. Because of this, some books were copied by people who did not own the book themselves. So lawmakers gave only owners the right to copy. National laws were somewhat standardized by international treaties."
"Because technology got better over time, copyright began to cover other types of media such as pictures, sound, and film. Commonly, copyright violation warning would be shown at the beginning of the media to warn audiences against violating copyright law."
Who owns copyright?
"In most countries, authors automatically own the copyright to any work they make or create, as long as they do not give the copyright to someone else."
"In most countries, there is no need to register the copyright, and some countries do not even have procedures to register copyrights. But, where registration is available, many authors register anyway, especially for works that are sold for money. That is because registration helps to prove that the copyright of a work belongs to a certain author."
"If an author gets paid to make a work for someone else, the person who pays for making the work (for example, the author's employer) will often get to own the copyright instead of the author themselves. For example, if a person working for a company, Microsoft creates a new computer software program at work, the Microsoft company would own the copyright. It is very common that the company will instead register the copyright to avoid their employees from claiming their works."
Length of copyright protection.
"Copyright laws usually protect owners of copyright beyond their lifetime. In some countries, such as Canada and New Zealand, works are protected for 50 years after the last living author dies. In other countries, like the United States and the European Union, the protection lasts for 70 years after death. When the period of copyright protection has ended, the written document, musical composition, book, picture, or other creative work is in the public domain. This means that no one owns the copyright and everyone is free to copy, use and change them without having to ask for permission or pay the owner."
Fair use.
"There is an exception to the rules of copyright, called fair use. This means that people can copy a very small amount of a work to use in reviews or in research reports."
"An example of fair use is when newspaper writers quote several sentences from a copyright-protected document to tell the story. Another example of ""fair use"" is when a university professor quotes several sentences from a copyright-protected book in a review of the book, or in a research report."
Copyright in different countries.
Different countries have different copyright laws. Most of the differences are about:
"Thumbelina lives alone as best she can in the fields. When winter comes, she needs to find a place to live. She is finally given a home by an old field mouse. Thumbelina thanks the mouse by taking care of her little house."
"The mouse thinks Thumbelina should marry her neighbor, a smart and well-to-do mole. Thumbelina finds the idea of being married to such a creature hateful. After all, he spends all of his days underground and never sees the sun or sky."
"The field mouse does not listen to Thumbelina's protests. She continues to urge the marriage. At the last minute, Thumbelina flies away with a swallow to a far, sunny land. Thumbelina brought the swallow back to health during the winter. They have been friends ever since."
"The swallow carries Thumbelina to a sunny land. In a field of flowers, Thumbelina meets a tiny flower-fairy prince just her size and to her liking. They wed. Her husband gives her a pair of wings so she can fly with him on his travels from flower to flower. She is given a new name, Maia."
"In the last page of the story, the swallow has flown to a poet's window, and tells him the complete story of Thumbelina."
"""Note:"" Mary Howitt was the first to translate the story into English. She disliked the encounter with the witch. In her translation, she starts the tale with a beggar woman giving a peasant's wife a barleycorn in exchange for food. Once the barleycorn is planted, tiny Thumbelina (Tommelise) emerges from its flower."
Background.
"Hans Christian Andersen was born in Odense, Denmark on 2 April 1805. His father was Hans Andersen, a shoemaker. His mother was Anne Marie Andersdatter, a laundress. Andersen was an only and a spoiled child. He shared a love of books with his father. His father read him ""The Arabian Nights"" and the fables of Jean de la Fontaine. Together, they built panoramas, pop-up pictures, and toy theatres. Father and son took long walks into the countryside."
"Andersen's father died in 1816. From then on, Andersen was on his own. Andersen was a tall, thin boy who was bullied by other boys. He wanted to escape them, and his poor, illiterate mother. He advertised his artistic talents to the middle class of Odense. He sang and danced in their homes. On 4 September 1819, the fourteen-year-old Andersen left Odense for Copenhagen with gifts of money he had received from his neighbors. He carried a letter of reference to the ballerina Madame Schall, and had dreams of becoming a poet, a ballet dancer, or an actor."
"After three years in Copenhagen without someone to support him, Andersen finally found an interested gentleman in Jonas Collin, the director of the Royal Theatre. Collin believed in the boy's talents. He managed to have the king send Andersen to a grammar school in Slagelse, a country town in west Zealand. He thought Andersen would continue his education at Copenhagen University at the right time."
"At Slagelse, Andersen was taught by the short, fat, balding thirty-five-year-old Simon Meisling. This man was interested in Ancient Greece and Rome, and had translated Virgil's ""Aeneid"". Andersen was not the brightest student in his class, and Meisling gave Andersen his sharp disapproval. ""You're a stupid boy who will never make it,"" Meisling told him. Meisling is believed to be the model for the learned mole in ""Thumbelina""."
"Fairy tale and folklore researchers Iona and Peter Opie believe that ""Thumbelina"" is a ""distant tribute"" to Andersen's friend, Henriette Wulff, the small, delicate, handicapped daughter of the Danish translator of Shakespeare. She loved Andersen as Thumbelina loves the swallow; however, there is no written evidence to support the ""distant tribute"" theory."
Sources.
"“Thumbelina” is completely Andersen’s invention. He knew other tales of little people such as the old English fairy tale of ""Tom Thumb"" and Jonathan Swift’s ""Gulliver's Travels"" with its tiny, six-inch Lilliputians. He may have found inspiration in these tales for ""Thumbelina"". He knew Voltaire‘s short story, “Micromégas“ (with its cast of huge and tiny peoples), and E. T. A. Hoffmann’s hallucinatory, erotic tale ""Meister Floh"". In Hoffmann's tale, a tiny lady torments the hero. A tiny girl also appears in Andersen‘s prose fantasy, ""A Journey on Foot from Holmen's Canal to the East Point of Amager"" (1828). Another image from literature similar to Andersen’s tiny being inside a flower is found in E. T. A. Hoffmann’s ""Princess Brambilla” (1821)."
First printing and critical reception.
"Andersen printed two booklets of ""Fairy Tales Told for Children"" in 1835. The first booklet was printed in May, and the second in December. ""Thumbelina"" was first printed in the December booklet by C. A. Reitzel on 16 December 1835 in Copenhagen. ""Thumbelina"" was the first tale in the booklet. The booklet included two other tales: ""The Naughty Boy"" and ""The Traveling Companion"". ""Thumbelina"" was printed again in collections of Andersen's works in 1850 and 1862."
"The second booklet of ""Fairy Tales Told for Children"" featured ""The Tinderbox"", ""Great Claus and Little Claus"", ""The Princess and the Pea"", and ""Little Ida's Flowers"". The third booklet, printed in 1837, included ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""The Emperor's New Clothes""."
"The first reviews of the seven tales of 1835 did not appear until 1836. The Danish critics did not like them. They thought the informal, chatty style of the tales and their lack of morals were not appropriate for children’s stories. One critic however thought that ""Thumbelina"" was “the most delightful fairy tale you could wish for.”"
"The critics did not believe Andersen should write other fairy tales. One journal never mentioned the first seven tales at all. Another advised Andersen not to waste his time writing fairy tales. One critic stated that Andersen ""lacked the usual form of that kind of poetry [...] and would not study models"". Andersen felt he was working against their ideas of what a fairy tale should be. He returned to writing novels, believing that this was his true calling. The critical reaction to the 1835 tales was so rough that Andersen waited a year before printing ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""The Emperor's New Clothes"". These two tales appeared in the third and final booklet of ""Fairy Tales Told for Children"" in 1837."
English translations.
"Mary Howitt was the first to translate ""Tommelise"" into English. She printed it in 1846 as ""Thumbelina"" in ""Wonderful Stories for Children"". However, she did not approve of the opening scene with the witch. Instead, she had the childless woman provide bread and milk to a hungry beggar woman. The childless woman was then rewarded with a barleycorn."
"Charles Boner also translated the tale in 1846 as ""Little Ellie"". Madame de Chatelain called the tiny child 'Little Totty' in her 1852 translation. The editor of ""The Child's Own Book"" (1853) called the child throughout, 'Little Maja'. H. W. Dulcken's widely printed volumes of Andersen's tales appeared in 1864 and 1866. Mrs. H. B. Paulli translated the name as 'Little Tiny' in the late-nineteenth century."
"In the twentieth century, Erik Christian Haugaard translated the name as 'Inchelina' in 1974. Jeffrey and Diane Crone Frank translated the name as 'Thumbelisa' in 2005. Modern English translations of ""Thumbelina"" are found in the six-volume complete edition of Andersen's tales from the 1940s by Jean Hersholt. Erik Christian Haugaard’s translation of the complete tales was published in 1974."
Commentaries.
"Fairy tale and folklore researchers Iona and Peter Opie have written that ""Thumbelina"" is an adventure story from the female point of view. They believe the story teaches the reader that people are happiest with their own kind. Thumbelina is a passive character and the victim of circumstances, they point out. Her male counterpart Tom Thumb (one of the tale’s inspirations) is an active character. He makes himself felt, and exerts himself."
"Folklorist Maria Tatar sees “Thumbelina” as a runaway bride story. She notes that it has been viewed as an allegory about arranged marriages. She points out that ""Thumbelina"" is a fable about being true to one’s heart. ""Thumbelina"" upholds the notion that the love of a prince is to be valued above all else."
"Tatar points out that in Hindu belief, a thumb-sized being known as the innermost self or soul dwells in the heart of all beings, human or animal. This concept may have absorbed by European folklore, then taken form as Tom Thumb and Thumbelina. Both characters seek transfiguration and redemption. She sees parallels between Andersen’s tale and the Greek myth of Demeter and her daughter, Persephone. Despite the pagan references in the tale, she notes that ""Thumbelina"" refers to Christ‘s suffering and resurrection, and the Christian concept of salvation."
"Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager writes that “Thumbelina” was the first of Andersen's tales to dramatize the sufferings and hardships of one who is different. As a result of being different, Thumbelina becomes the object of mockery. It was also the first of Andersen's tales to use the swallow as the symbol of the poetic soul. Andersen identified with the swallow as a migratory bird whose pattern of life his own traveling days were beginning to resemble."
"Roger Sale believes Andersen's feelings of social and sexual inferiority were expressed in the tale by creating characters that are inferior to their beloveds. The Little Mermaid, for example, has no soul while her human beloved has a soul as his birthright. In “Thumbelina”, Andersen suggests the toad, the beetle, and the mole are Thumbelina’s inferiors. They should remain in their places rather than wanting their superior. Sale indicates they are not inferior to Thumbelina but simply ""different"". He suggests that Andersen may have done some damage to the animal world when he colored his animal characters with his own feelings of inferiority."
"Jacqueline Banerjee views the tale as a story about failure. “Not surprisingly,“ she writes, “”Thumbelina“ is now often read as a story of specifically female empowerment.“ Susie Stephens believes Thumbelina herself is a grotesque. She observes that “the grotesque in children’s literature is [...] a necessary and beneficial component that enhances the psychological welfare of the young reader“. Children are attracted to the cathartic qualities of the grotesque, she suggests."
"Sidney Rosenblatt in his essay, ""Thumbelina and the Development of Female Sexuality"" believes the tale may be analyzed from the perspective of Freudian psychosexual development. He believes the story is one of female masturbation. Thumbelina herself, he posits, could symbolize the clitoris, her rose petal coverlet the labia, the white butterfly ""the budding genitals"", and the mole and the prince the anal and vaginal openings respectively."

Early life.
"Martín Chambi was born in a poor Quechua family. He was born in one of the poorest parts of Peru, at the end of the nineteenth century. His father worked in a gold mine by the River Inambari. Martín sometimes went to work with his father too. He saw his first photographer there at the mine. Chambi learned the basic techniques from a photographer at the Santo Domingo Mine. This meeting fired his ambition."
"Chambi tried to work as a professional photographer after this. He traveled to the city of Arequipa in 1908, where photography was more developed. Many professional photographers lived in Areqiupa. They had developed individual photographic styles and professional techniques."
Chambi was an apprentice in the studio of Max T. Vargas. After nine years he created his own studio in Sicuani in 1917. He published his first postcards in November 1917.
"In 1923 he moved to Cusco and opened a studio there. In Cusco he photographed rich society people and poor indigenous people. During his career, Chambi also travelled all over the Andes. He photographed the landscapes, Inca ruins, and local people. Chambi was with the American explorer Hiram Bingham when Bingham ""discovered"" Machu Picchu, the great Inca monument."

Reception history of Jane Austen
"The reception history of Jane Austen shows how Austen's works, at first having modest fame, became wildly popular. Her books are both the subject of great study and the center of various fan culture. Jane Austen, the writer of such works as ""Pride and Prejudice"" (1813) and ""Emma"" (1815), has become one of the most famous novelists in the English language."
"During her lifetime, Austen's books did not make her very famous. Like a great number of women writers at that time, she chose to publish her books secretly. Only among people in the aristocracy, her writing was an open secret. At the time they were published, Austen's works were thought fashionable by members of high society. However, they received only a few good reviews. By the mid-nineteenth century, her works were respected by people who were learned in literature. They thought that liking her works was a sign that they were clever. In 1870, her nephew published ""Memoir of Jane Austen"". This showed her to a wider public as ""dear, quiet aunt Jane"". After this, her works were published again in popular editions. By the twentieth century, lots of groups had formed. Some praised her and some defended her from the ""teeming masses"". However, they all claimed to be true Janeites, or people who really appreciated Austen."
"Early in the twentieth century, scholars made a collection of her works (the first for any British novelist). But it was not until the 1940s that Austen was widely accepted as a ""great English novelist"". In the second half of the twentieth century, people began studying Austen more and more, and in different ways. For example, they studied her works artistically, ideologically, and historically. The university English departments began developing in the first half of the twentieth century. As they grew, criticism of Austen split into remarkable high culture and popular culture trends. In the late twentieth century, fans made Jane Austen societies and clubs. They praised Austen, her time, and her works. In the early twenty-first century, Austen fans support an industry of printed sequels and prequels. They also support Austen's work in television and film."
Background.
"Jane Austen lived her entire life as part of a large and close family. Her family was in the lower part of the English gentry. Her family's steady support was very important to Austen's development as a writer. For example, Austen read her first drafts of all of her books to her family. In this way, she received encouragement and help. In fact, it was her father who first tried to put her book in print. Austen's training as a writer lasted from when she was a teenager until she was about 35. During this time, she experimented with different literary forms. This included the epistolary novel (novel in letters), which she tried and did not like. She wrote and revised three important novels and began a fourth. When ""Sense and Sensibility"" (1811), ""Pride and Prejudice"" (1813), ""Mansfield Park"" (1814) and ""Emma"" (1815) came out in print, she became a successful writer."
"However, novel-writing was not easy for women in the early nineteenth century. This was because it made them famous. It also made people think them unfeminine. So like a great number of other female writers, Austen published her books secretly. In time, though, her writing became an open secret among the aristocracy. In one of her visits to London, the Prince Regent invited her to his home. His librarian showed her around and said that the Regent liked her books very much. The librarian added that ""if Miss Austen had any other Novel forthcoming, she was quite at liberty to dedicate it to the Prince"". Austen did not like the prince, who spent a lot of money. She did not want to follow this suggestion. However, her friends persuaded her to follow it. Therefore, ""Emma"" was dedicated to him. Austen refused the librarian's suggestion after that to write a historical romance for the prince's daughter's marriage."
"In the last year of her life, Austen revised ""Northanger Abbey"" (1817) and wrote ""Persuasion"" (1817). She also began another novel, which was later titled ""Sanditon"". She could not finish it before her death. Austen did not have time to see ""Northanger Abbey"" or ""Persuasion"" through the press. However, her family published them as one book after she died. Her brother Henry included a ""Biographical Notice of the Author"". This short biography made people think of Austen as a quiet aunt who wrote in her free time. ""Neither the hope of fame nor profit mixed with her early motives (purposes) ... [S]o much did she shrink from notoriety, that no accumulation of fame would have induced (made) her, had she lived, to affix (put) her name to any productions of her public she turned away from any allusion to the character of an authoress."" However, Austen shows excitement in her letters about getting her books in print. She was also interested in how much money the books would make. Austen was a professional writer."
"Austen's works are noted for their realism, biting social commentary, and clever use of free indirect speech. They are also remarkable for their burlesque and irony. They criticize the novels of sensibility of the second half of the eighteenth century. They are part of the change to nineteenth-century realism. As Susan Gubar and Sandra Gilbert explain, Austen laughed at ""love at first sight, the primacy (first importance) of passion over all other emotions and/or duties, the exploits of the hero, the vulnerable sensitivity of the heroine, the lovers' proclaimed (declared) indifference to financial considerations, and the cruel of parents"". Austen's stories, though comic, focus on the way women depend on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. She was also concerned with moral problems, like Samuel Johnson, who strongly influenced her."
1812–1821: Individual reactions and contemporary reviews.
"Austen's books quickly became fashionable. Aristocrats who liked to set the fashion and taste of the day especially liked them. Henrietta Ponsonby, Countess of Bessborough wrote about ""Sense and Sensibility"" in a letter to a friend. She said: ""it is a clever novel.  ... tho' it ends stupidly, I was much amused by it."" The 15-year-old daughter of the Prince Regent, Princess Charlotte Augusta, compared herself to Marianne Dashwood. She remarked, ""I think Marianne &amp; me are very like in ""disposition"", that certainly I am not so good, the same , &amp;tc"". ""Pride and Prejudice"" was enjoyed by Richard Sheridan, a person who wrote plays. He told a friend to ""[b]uy it immediately"" for it ""was one of the cleverest things"" he had ever read. Anne Milbanke, future wife of Lord Byron, wrote that ""I have finished the Novel called Pride and Prejudice, which I think a very superior (good) work."" She added that ""is the most ""probable"" fiction I have ever read"" and had become ""at present the fashionable novel"". The Dowager Lady Vernon told a friend that ""Mansfield Park"" was ""[n]ot much of a novel, more the history of a family party in the country, very natural"". Lady Anne Romilly told her friend, the writer Maria Edgeworth, that ""[""Mansfield Park""] has been pretty generally admired here"". Edgeworth later said that ""we have been much entertained with Mansfield Park""."
"High society liked and approved of Austen's novels. However, they received few reviews while she was alive. There were two for ""Sense and Sensibility"". ""Pride and Prejudice"" received three. ""Mansfield Park"" received none. There were seven for ""Emma"". Most of the reviews were short, careful, and approving. They mostly focused on the moral lessons of her books. Brian Southam writes about these reviewers: ""their job was merely to provide brief (short) notices, extended with quotations, for the benefit (good) of women readers compiling their library lists and interested only in knowing whether they would like a book for its story, its characters and moral""."
"Famous writer Walter Scott wrote the longest and deepest of these reviews. He was asked by publisher John Murray to review ""Emma"". ""Emma"" had come out in print (without saying who the writer was) in the March 1816 issue of the ""Quarterly Review"". Using the review as a way to praise the novel, Scott praised Austen's works. He praised her ability to copy ""from nature as she really exists in the common walks of life, and presenting to the correct and striking representation of that which is daily (every day) taking place around him"". Modern Austen scholar William Galperin has noted that ""unlike some of Austen's lay readers, who recognized her divergence (difference) from realistic practice as it had been prescribed and defined at the time, Walter Scott may well have been the first to install Austen as the realist par excellence"". Scott wrote in his private journal in 1826 about Austen. This later became a widely quoted comparison:"
It's not getting any better.
"Yeah,"
I can't even hear what you're
"Oh, okay."
"Oh jeez,"
it's gone.
"I don't see, I don't think my phone really does that,"
"but every time I have this phone is a little weird,"
I mean it's been dropped on the floor a hundred times.
"Well, I don't know,"
there was
"well, whatever it was, there was a second there"
"I couldn't even hear what you were saying,"
"but, um,"
"Yeah,"
"I was beating on the phone going,"
Can you hear me.
"Yeah,"
I guess I was having a hard time there too.
"I thought it sounded,"
"well, I guess we better stick to the subject for the benefit of the people uh, uh, doing this work."
Yeah.
"But, uh,"
"yeah,"
"I mean, that's a heck of a"
"you must have a lot of different stuff you get out of there,"
"especially up in Vermont there, you should have, uh, some really nice soil."
"Yeah,"
"we grow a lot of, uh, the basic, corn, potatoes."
Uh-huh.
She likes to really get into her pumpkins
"and see how many she can grow. corn, potatoes,"
"Yeah,"
"unfortunately it's starting to really, you know, look at people's habits and  where they are at particular points of the day."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Like one of the guys I work with really laughs when he looks at Minneapolis because he's from Detroit
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, the, the crime level there, of course, is quite a bit, quite a bit, uh, more pronounced, uh"
Uh-huh.
"but, uh, yeah."
"I guess,"
"I mean,"
"I think we've got a neighborhood watch program here in Minneapolis,"
"I'm not real sure. Uh,"
"Yeah,"
"it helps to know your neighbors, you know."
"They give you,"
"you're supposed to make lists of, uh, cars."
"Like I know a lot of my neighbors right around my development. If I see a car that's unfamiliar, we, we have a list"
"is that what you, you did in your program? Where you have a list of license plates?"
Pretty much.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"I was, I was basically, involved in that, in the organization of it."
Uh-huh.
And then I left right in the middle of it.
"I'm not sure  where we went from there,"
"Oh, uh-huh."
"but,"
Yeah. Well.
"Yeah,"
"that, that whole thing of being alert and kind of noticing your surroundings, noticing people who look suspicious uh, activities like that, sure."
Uh-huh.
I could be wrong.
"Uh, I do not know what, what it is percentage wise"
"but I,"
I do not know for sure either.
"But it always seems well, it just felt different like when we were in Texas."
It had a different feel to it.
Yeah.
"It is, it is drier in Dallas than it is in Houston or San Antonio or even Austin, which is further south."
Uh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
But it is not dry.
"And, and I have lived here for many years,"
and I think it has gotten more humid over the years.
"Where the water is coming from, I don't know."
Uh-huh.
"Well, it could be."
"I know my brother's home has been flooded a couple of times, uh,"
"Oh, does he live near the lake?"
"Well, there is a lake not far"
"but it is more run off from surrounding, you know, areas and that."
Uh-huh.
Uh.
"And, uh, he is just in an area where it is just low enough that it's, you know, it, it collects there."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, he has had a couple of inches in his house several times."
"That is, that is a problem, uh,"
"they tell you when you are looking for a house or, or, or buying land to build on, to be very careful and check the drainage because, uh, it is, it is deceptive."
Uh-huh.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Because of that.
more because of their personalities than their sportsman
Uh-huh.
Well part of it was the personality and their sportsmanship.
Another part of it was I'd pick one out that was different than what my husband was rooting for
"so you know, the competitor,"
and I became involved in following his career.
Right
"And, uh, I know that, that my husband,"
Tom Kite was his fair haired boy.
Oh.
And he thought he was spectacular.
"I said, Whoa."
"I'm not going to, I'm not going to stay interested in him."
So I decided Andy Bean was good competition
Uh-huh.
"Any time they both played, why, he was just real excited when Tom was, you know, shown on the television,"
and I followed Andy Bean.
Uh-huh
We both followed Lee Trevino into the Seniors.
"Oh, he's interesting."
He is.
I like to watch him.
"He is a character not just a golfer,"
Yeah.
but he's quite a character.
Yeah.
"And there are some really, really wonderful people in the game of golf who do give wonderful role models."
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
I think you're right.
"And I think it's critical, it's critical to have a good role model in any field, any sports."
Yeah.
"Which was, uh,"
"I, I find that fascinating that, uh,"
"Yeah,"
"I do, too."
Do you ever listen to the radio
"or any,"
"I listen to K R L D, and, uh, uh, K L I F, the news talk radio."
Uh-huh.
And I actually listen to C N N radio.
Do you know it was on radio now?
"No,"
I don't.
It's on eleven ninety.
"Um. I really, uh, have gotten out of the habit of listening to the radio from any kind of, even music"
"and, uh,"
"Well, when I go to work I listen."
"Yeah,"
my husband does
"and it's how come he usually calls me sometimes, and says, oh, I just heard on the news that such and such happened, you know, if it's something really interesting"
"and and then I'll know to, to keep an eye out for it,"
Yeah.
but I've got out of the habit of listening to the radio.
"Well, with, with your, you know,"
"if you're around the home, though and, and, and can watch T V and read the paper, the problem is, is that about twenty minutes of news radio, or thirty minutes is"
and then they start repeating everything.
Uh-huh.
"And, and so it's kind of a, oh,"
"that's what's interesting is the C N N, uh,"
"I don't think, I'm trying to think if it's much local."
I listen to a little of that
and I listen to a little of ninety point one.
"I, I'm, I'm inveterate switcher."
"I mean, it's, it's,"
"and so I'm going, I'm so old"
"and I'm, I, I really have to always tell myself, no, you're not, you're very young."
"No,"
"you're extremely,"
"yeah,"
"it's, it's"
"And, you know, so it's,"
"Well it's like us, we're getting ready to do, if possible, for an adoption"
"and I have friends that say well why would you do that,  if you know you haven't been able to children, which we do know, why would you do that now, at this part, point,"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"and, um, it's just individual choices."
Yeah.
"I stopped comparing myself a long time ago to somebody who had, um,"
"in my family my brother's children,"
Uh-huh.
"I mean, he just turned forty,"
his children will be out of high school before he's forty-five.
Wow.
"Um, I mean that's like your mother,"
"look how young she is,  compared to where you are out of school and everything."
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
Right.
"It's just, it,"
"but what you find is you don't compare the woman, because you just get into trouble."
It's all independent and choices.
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
very true.
"Um, but what I was going to say about mothers is, uh, your mother probably just won't say it,"
"yeah,"
"lot of people don't, don't see the excitement in sailing,"
"but, then, again, they may they may never have tried anything like, uh, catamaran"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, that's when you really start getting into speed. You know,"
"you actually, some catamarans you can actually pull people behind, the skiers,"
"they get so fast, you know."
I didn't know that.
"Yeah,"
"they get pretty quick,"
but
That that would be something.
"uh,"
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"I haven't, I haven't personally done that,"
"but, uh, the races,"
"I, I work with a guy right now that, uh, races catamarans in the summertime"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, he's pretty gassed about it."
"He's got a good, uh,"
"What kind of, what lake do you all use?"
"Well, he, uh, he's from Detroit"
Uh-huh.
"so he usually goes on one of the Great Lakes, I think, and does his sailing. Uh,"
"for me, I, I go back to Orlando, uh, in about a month, and so, down there, basically just go to the coast."
"We're about thirty miles from Coco Beach and the east coast,"
"and there's a lot of places there you can go, you know."
"So, uh, so that's a good thing."
Yeah.
"But, yeah, so, what do you do for a job?"
"Uh, I build transformers."
"and in Orlando, there's, crime is getting to be a bigger problem than ever,"
so.
"Oh, yeah."
What part of California are you from?
"San Jose, California."
"Oh, really?"
I have a good friend there.
"Here, you know, the real problems are the gangs."
Yeah .
"A lot of gang related, a lot of murders, uh, just in general the whole,"
we've only been here a couple of years.
"Uh, before that we lived in Colorado"
"but in comparison to Colorado, it's real noticeable."
Oh yeah.
Uh-huh.
"I mean you can just feel, I mean, I can just sense,"
"I mean I won't even, I won't go to the grocery store at night."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
that's
You know.
"And it, it's that kind of thing"
"and, uh,"
"That's really a shame when it has to constrain your activities like,"
Yeah.
"We have a neighborhood watch program in the house, uh, the development that we live in, which I think is a great way to reduce, uh, home theft, burglary, and things  of that sort."
Sure.
Do you have that where you live
"or,"
"Well, uh, interestingly enough, right before I moved up here,"
I'm an intern
and then I go  back down in May.
"But, um, what I do do, and I've always done it is,"
"at my father's house, we have, my sister and I have a couple of gardens."
"I think we figured out total, this is for vegetables about two thirds of an acre."
Uh-huh.
So we each have a third of an acre we do.
"Jeez,"
"that's more than, that's more than the property I have right here, that you've got as a, uh, garden,"
That's a lot
that's amazing.
"Yeah,"
"well, it's my dad's,"
and we've had it for he's been there for a long time
Right.
"so, um, it just happens they built a shopping center next to it"
"Oh, jeez."
"but, um, they put up a nice fence,"
"so we still have a lot of privacy,"
and we grow a lot of food.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I enjoy it,"
"um, the gardens are kind of old,"
"you have to step down in them now because we've tilled them so much,"
Uh-huh.
"but there's still,"
"we, we, my sister uses probably a fertilizer."
I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
"But I wish this phone would stop screeching,"
Are you getting a lot of static on your end of the line?
Yes.
"I'm trying,"
I don't know if it's my phone.
This is bad.
"Well, no fault's rather funny in Colorado, because it seems that everyone pays all the time instead of just the guilty party pays."
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"It's kind of, it's kind of strange here the way things go. Uh,"
"here if you have an accident and no one's injured, the police won't even show up."
You're kidding.
Nope.
"They say if nobody's injured, you all exchange names and take it up with your insurance company."
God.
"Well, if you,"
"I don't know how familiar you are with Maryland,"
"but, uh,"
Not at all.
"especially, the center part of Maryland where I Ninety-Five runs through it is really heavily populated."
There's just so many people and so many accidents every single day that it'd take a whole another police force just to answer the traffic.
They don't even try to keep up with it.
No.
God.
Not a bit.
So you lived in Texas for a while.
Yes
sir.
Huh.
"I spent, uh, couple of years down there."
Moved down there in eighty-seven
and moved out in eighty-nine.
"Are, where you from originally."
"Uh, right here in Maryland."
"Huh,"
so you just basically went home when you had a chance.
"Yeah,"
Right.
Ran out of jeans
"I understand,"
that's funny
"So, does it change?"
No.
"Your dress,"
no.
"No,"
huh-uh.
"So, or, I guess, do you have things like presentations to do or anything like that?"
"No,"
huh-uh.
"So, back in my old job, up until through nineteen eighty I would usually wear blue jeans and pullover shirts and the like,"
Uh-huh.
"but, probably once a month or so, there was some reason that I would have to put on a suit. For a customer presentation or something."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Every now and then I'll get dressed up and come in,"
but that's for my husband's job and not mine
"Oh, I see,"
I understand.
"I have to go to a business meeting once a month with him,"
"but So,"
"Oh. Well, that's interesting."
"Let's see, uh, what else about this, uh,"
"it, it seems like T I is pretty cut and dried with two, like, two or three levels."
Uh-huh.
"That there's the upper management that always wears gray suits. And the people that don't, uh,"
Uh-huh.
"I would, if you, if I want to say don't have power or don't have authority or whatever like I used to be in that research"
"My husband is a counselor,"
"and he works, mostly with adolescents."
"Oh, you know a lot about that."
"So yeah,"
I hear a lot of horror stories about things like that.
Uh-huh.
"But most of the time it's they get into the wrong crowd first,"
and then they start a drug problem.
Yeah.
"It's usually not a one time accidental thing, I don't think."
"Yeah,"
"I know,"
I'm glad of that.
"And I have, knock wood, pretty good luck, or very good luck with my daughters on so far,"
"that's my conference call,"
I have one daughter still at home.
One's at U T
"and one's at home, gets dozen calls a night."
"Oh, well I'll let you go if you want to go ahead and take that,"
"No,"
"no,"
"I don't care about that,"
she'll be on the phone all night.
"Yeah,"
"it seems if you watch what kind of crowd that start running around with and kind of keep up with who their friends are that's best way to avoid trouble, from what I can gather."
Right.
Do you have children?
No
"not yet,"
"we're expecting a baby in July,"
"Oh, great,"
so we're starting.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, but in Orlando, before I moved up, we had a real problem with it."
"Uh, we've been broken into in my apartment about four times in like two and a half weeks."
"Oh, no."
"And one of the things that I, I helped organize was a neighborhood watch type situation  down there."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, because they were just,"
"it's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because  everybody went to work, you know,"
Uh-huh.
"and then the houses were left unguarded, uh,"
"but yeah,"
"I think given that people are pretty conscientious about it,"
"that's a good way to, to work it, with a neighborhood  watch."
Yeah.
"Well, you know, uh, also I've heard that, uh, the newest thing is a lot of people are specializing in robbing people during the time they're home.  Like on the weekends."
"Oh, is that right?"
"A high percentage of, uh, free time,"
"I think it's like fifty percent of most people's free time is, uh, spent doing yard work outdoors."
Oh.
"So they wait while you're out, outdoors."
They know the house is unlocked
"and then they just slip in. Slip in, slip out, you know."
That's amazing.
They know exactly what they're going for.
Yeah.
"So, I've heard that's really on the rise as far as  uh, you know, a new type of crime."
"Uh,"
"Yeah,"
it almost seems like they're getting quite a bit smarter.
Yeah
"Really, you know."
"Unfortunately, yes."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Uh, I, I know my friend is, uh, really into guns"
"and, uh, uh, I went a couple of times with him to gun shows, you know, that  come through town and everything"
Uh-huh.
"and, I mean, they just have, I mean they have anything you'd want,"
I mean
Uh-huh.
"you know, you know, anywhere from rifles and semiautomatic weapons and there's, I mean, there's nothing."
You can just go buy one and take it home
"and it's easier than getting a, like a video membership card at, you know, a video store."
"I, see now, I know they were having a gun show about a month ago"
"and I was just wondering how that did work, if somebody wanted to buy a gun at a gun show."
"Uh, yeah,"
yeah.
"You just go and, uh, buy the gun"
"and, uh,"
There's no restriction though.
You don't have to wait or nothing then huh?
No.
"Well, except for the, the pistols and"
I'm not sure how they do that.
"I know they,"
"Yeah,"
"I was just curious, you know, because, uh"
Uh-huh.
"I know at, at the regular gun show, you know, gun shop that you, that you do have to wait for pistols, like a couple  of weeks"
Uh-huh.
Right.
"and then they check you out,"
then they call you up
and you go pick it up.
very definitely.
And so you've got a real balance to make there.
Uh-huh.
What about you?
"Well, I'm thinking about it more in terms of my parents that are starting to get old."
"They aren't really that old,"
"but they are, sort of wearing out."
My mamma is a dialysis patient
Uh-huh.
"and she is only about sixty-four,"
but she's had some pretty close calls
and my daddy has to drive her to dialysis now
and so she's phasing out ounds like
"and, but she's also a very, very, very independent person and doesn't like having having people, uh, not being able to do things for herself when she wants to"
Uh-huh.
"uh, I know they certainly don't want to be in a nursing home,"
but my daddy keeps talking about it.
"I don't,"
"I couldn't possibly, couldn't never see him in a nursing home."
ery faint.
"And my grand daddy also doesn't like, wouldn't want to be in a nursing home."
"He's ninety, I think right on ninety right now"
Oh really.
and he's living by himself.
My grand mamma died a couple of years ago
"Oh, okay."
"so but, he's, you know,"
"as long as you can have the families take care of the people, I'd like to see them stay at home."
"Yeah,"
but it gets hard.
"My, my grandmother is in her mid eighties"
Uh-huh.
"Well, maybe this year you can find a more central location."
"Well, but the majority of them are in, like, just like how you said in close, close quarters."
So it is easier for us few stragglers to go home.
"Oh, okay."
Then the majority of them are still in the Missouri area.
Yeah.
Okay.
"You know our family right now, uh, the most of it, there is only a few stragglers, uh, with any distance."
"There is one cousin out in Colorado, uh, uh, some cousins over in Phoenix, uh,"
"I got a sister over in, in, uh, Washington State"
"Uh, the rest of them are within, you know, a couple hours drive."
"Well, uh, how do you all communicate? Like to plan it and every thing."
"Do you all just call each other up on the phone and say this is the weekend we are going to do it,"
or do you all like mail out stuff?
That is pretty much it.
Yeah.
"It is going to be such and such, uh, weekend"
"and, uh, you all come."
Yeah.
That is about it
And you know this is the standard pattern.
"It, uh,"
everybody brings their favorite dish
"and, somebody brings the volleyball net,"
somebody brings a whole lot of ice for the watermelon
"and,"
"Well, uh, uh, I guess probably the last one I went to I met so many people that I had not seen in probably ten, over ten years."
"It was like, don't you remember me."
And I am like no
Am I related to you?
Yeah.
I know.
"Do you hear, the, the beep in the background."
Yes.
"Oh, that's a, an ambulance or something going on here, I think."
Okay.
"Where, Where are you,"
I haven't ever noticed the thirty second warning actually.
"and, uh,"
In Manhattan.
Are you at home now?
"Yeah,"
I'm at home.
So you've got a lot of traffic noise real close.
Uh-huh.
"So it'd be interesting for the people that look at this signal I mean, because there's a lot of background noise that, you know, people can hear."
So it'll be interesting how much of it actually gets picked up.
"Um, yeah,"
"and often times that,"
"I can't talk on can't do this much later than now, between sort of like six, five thirty and six thirty or something like that, because the traffic outside, they honk the horn so loud I can't even hear the phone call."
What time is it now where you are?
"Uh, about twenty after four."
So you're an hour ahead of where I am.
I'm in Central Central time zone.
"Okay,"
yeah
we're Eastern.
"And, um, what did, did you ever try using like Prodigy or any of those systems?"
"No,"
I haven't done that.
"Uh, I know someone who has,"
"and, and she's, uh, very, uh, pleased with it."
"She told me some of the things you can do,"
"and it's just a, a very handy tool to have."
Yeah.
"yeah,"
seven yards of sand.
"I got to shovel it all, lots of fun."
"Yeah,"
"I have to do that,"
"I want to make some flower beds,"
and I'm going to have a seven yard truck come in with some top soil.
Uh-huh.
"And I'm going to,"
my problem is I want to use those rail ties to build up a planter
Sure.
"but I don't know if the creosote in the rail ties is going to do something, you know, if I want to grow a tomato or something in there"
Right.
"Well, it seems,"
"I mean, I guess it'd go with my flowers."
"I've seen a lot of people use them, you know, for flower beds,"
"but I don't know what, whether they'd have creosote would do anything,"
"I mean,"
"Yeah,"
"I don't, I don't, I just don't think you,"
I always thought I'd put a tomato plant in there or something weird
Uh-huh.
but I don't think I could really eat the fruit off it without wondering.
And I don't know if they make landscape ties that aren't treated.
"Well, you can get, um, you can get pressurized lumber,"
"Yeah,"
"but they put, some kind of chemicals in there too."
"Oh, that's right."
"there's even, there's bad chemicals in those too."
Yeah.
"Well, I'm not really worried about it,"
Especially if you need a tune-up.
Uh-huh.
"They kept saying that the that's what Chryslers did, is they wore out starters."
"Yeah,"
"well, if they start real easy, you know, you just hit the key"
and it starts up
Yeah.
"and when it's properly tuned up, that starter will last for a long time."
Uh-huh.
"See, they built that starter so it would fit every V eight and all the slant sixes that they've built in like thirty-five years."
Right.
They all take the exact same starter.
They'll interchange completely.
I mean completely.
One starter will fit all of them.
"So they've got a whole lot of torque,"
"but to do that, they did it,"
"use an underdrive system,"
"but they geared it down so the motor spins really fast so it's got, to spin for very long,"
Uh-huh.
it's kind of tough on the bushings.
Yeah.
Usually what goes is the bushings.
Right.
"You take a little time, replace the bushings, you still got a perfectly good starter."
"But, uh, most places don't put, don't rebuild them with, with with good enough bushings."
Uh-huh.
"So it's, you know,"
"after you get rebuilt one, you have a tendency to go through them pretty quickly, especially if you need a tune-up."
Yeah.
"Anyway, what are you driving now?"
"Uh, my Chrysler van"
"and I think about these things and people trying to define their own world view,"
"and, uh what exactly do we, you know, do we see about this world,"
Um.
or why are we so fascinated with the other world.
Is it supposed to be better?
"The other world,"
yeah.
Sometimes I think we think it is.
We like those things that way.
"Um, I'm, I'm sure that it seems like,"
"it certainly would, would explain the preoccupation with ,"
but I suspect it's always been a preoccupation with that sort of things.
"Well, it has."
"All the way through history, there's, I guess,"
if you want to call its mysticism or the occult or whatever. It's always fascinated.
"I guess because we don't know,"
and there's no real way of finding out.
"Right,"
well.
There's only one way of finding it.
"Well did you ever see, um, FLATLINERS."
"No,"
"I did, uh, did not."
"The girl next to me saw it,"
and she really liked it.
"That's, that's, that's probably one of those ones that, you know,"
"it's on video now, I think."
"Yeah,"
it is.
"Probably, probably worth seeing on video."
"Actually we really enjoyed it,"
but it was also right along the same lines.
Yeah.
"Now, I sort of take pride in, uh, in the yard, and, you know, how the place looks,"
"and, uh, so I don't mind doing it so much anymore."
"Yeah,"
"so do you have a, do you have a garden,"
or do you just do your landscaping now and your lawn?
"Well, it's, yeah, it's, it's primarily just, uh, like landscaping a little bit."
"You know, I've got some, uh, bushes around the you know, foundation planning, things like that,"
"and then there's some, just some little flower beds,"
"and my mom grows,"
"she's an avid gardener,"
"and she starts her own stuff from seed now,"
and she gets a little over zealous when she is planting these seeds in the wintertime and starting them.
"Uh, she ends up with so many plants that she can't fit them all in her garden."
"They have a huge yard and a huge house,"
and so she brings them up here from Philadelphia and gives me all her extras.
"Well, that's pretty good."
Yeah.
"My, my sister is very over zealous, too."
She's got some really nice flower beds.
She puts a lot of time into them.
"This is my first year in a, in a house where I'm thinking about doing some flower beds and stuff."
"Oh, we, I've always had crude ones at my father's,"
but this is the first time that I really have to landscape a house.
Yeah.
His house is more like a farm house.
It's not on a main road.
Uh-huh.
"My house is on a main road,"
and it has nothing
Yeah.
"I mean, nothing."
"I mean they, they would go ahead and kill themselves for three or four minutes to see what happens."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"they said, she said that this was almost believable"
that could really happen.
"You know, you get the medical profession doing these kinds of things,"
and you never know.
"Almost,"
"yeah,"
"I, I, it's a little far fetched to, find a bunch of medical students doing it,"
"but but, it was, um, it was, it was odd enough, you know,"
Yeah.
and they didn't just sort of make it silly.
"It was, you know, it was done fairly well, I think."
"So. Actually, I actually enjoyed that as well."
Yeah.
I like it when they will do something and not get too silly.
"I've been disappointed in some movies that, they don't know how to end it, it seems like,"
so then they get crazy
"and, and it doesn't end like the story has been going."
The story sort of keeps going and going.
Well I guess that covers our topic.
"Yeah,"
great.
"Well, it was, nice talking to you."
Nice talking to you.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
That sounded like one.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I think that there is something definitely wrong with our school system just because of the results that you see coming out of the school system, as far as, uh, people dropping out of school, uh, grades on test scores being low, uh, more and more people taking G E D trying to get out of high school instead of just going through high school."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"but,"
"Catches you off guard, doesn't it?"
"Yes,"
"yes,"
"some of them, some of them do"
"and some of them don't,"
"but, uh, this one, uh,"
I was trying to remember back.
"It seems to me that, that, you know, when I studied civics in school or stuff, that this, the juries being involved in the sentencing wasn't, wasn't so much."
Uh-huh.
"And I'm, I'm trying to figure out whether that's, I'm remembering wrong or whether that's a by state."
I didn't think they were either.
I thought the sentencing was done by the judge.
Yeah.
"I mean, it's either guilty or not guilty."
Yeah.
"And, uh, I, I guess,"
"and I don't know whether it's by state or whether there's been some supreme, supreme court decision perhaps that said that, uh, that, uh, as part of the trial by the peers that had to include the sentencing or too, or whatever."
Changes.
Uh-huh.
"I,"
"yeah,"
"but, I, yeah, I certainly wouldn't be, uh, uh, worried about that."
"I guess in terms of the, uh, you know, having a judge do it would seem to me to be more, more fair and and, uh unbiased."
"Oh, sure."
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"Uh, in terms of doing away with the, with the unanimous jury, I guess, I guess I, uh, would be a little more leery of that kind of a change in, in the trial system."
"That, that's just a, such a tradition that it's a, that it's got to be a unanimous jury that, uh, I don't know where you'd, where you'd draw the line anywhere else. Uh, you know, uh two-thirds or three-fourths or whatever."
Exactly.
Exactly.
I think you will enjoy that.
"Okay,"
good.
Yeah.
"Well, it certainly is nice talking with you Gene."
"And, uh, what is your phone at home?"
That's it.
Yes.
"What do you think are possible changes in the, uh, way trials are conducted these days?"
"Do you like the way some people in there for instance, really take over and, uh, we have no way, uh, of knowing whether they are legitimately right or wrong and so forth."
Yeah.
What do you think about these things?
"Well, as I look at our trial systems,"
I think they've gotten to be quite a joke. The way the people can appeal and file for mistrials
and they've taken a lot of the things that were set up to make it be a fair system and used it to their advantage.
"I think that a jury should listen to the courts, uh, to, to the hearings and to everything,"
but I think they should only weigh fifty percent of the decision.
"I think the judge should hold the, or maybe even forty-nine,"
and the judge should be able to rule one way or the other.
so you're saying you think the judge should actually have the final say?
I think he should.
And I think that there should be more than one judge.
"There should be maybe two, at least that sit in and listen so that there's no way that you could have like a crooked judge."
Huh.
Do you know what I mean?
Yes.
I know what you mean.
"Um, and I think that there, it's important to have a jury, but I think the way that they go through so much time to get it a fair one."
That's okay too.
As long as it's not used to delay the trial so much.
They need to have a fair jury
"but they only you know, would cover forty-nine percent of the decision or fifty percent"

Compound NJ2 is a xanthylium yellowish pigment found in wine.
"In model solutions, colorless compounds, such as catechin, can give rise to new types of pigments. The first step is the formation of colorless dimeric compounds consisting of two flavanol units linked by carboxy-methine bridge. This is followed by the formation of xanthylium salt yellowish pigments and their ethylesters, resulting from the dehydration of the colorless dimers, followed by an oxidation process. The loss of a water molecule takes place between two A ring hydroxyl groups of the colorless dimers."

= = = Barony of Nikli = = =
"The Barony of Nikli was a medieval Frankish fiefdom of the Principality of Achaea, located in the southern Arcadia region of the Peloponnese peninsula in Greece, and centred on the town of Nikli (; ; ), also known as Amyklai or Amyklion (Ἀμύκλαι, Αμύκλιον)."
"The Barony of Nikli was established ca. 1209, after the conquest of the Peloponnese by the Crusaders, and was one of the original twelve secular baronies within the Principality of Achaea. The barony, with six knight's fiefs attached to it, was given to a lord known in the Greek and Italian versions of the ""Chronicle of the Morea"" only as William, but whose family name is given by Angevin records as Morlay. William was succeeded by his son Hugh—although Karl Hopf suggested the interposition of a second William after the original founder for chronological reasons—and then, around 1280, by Androuin de Villiers or de Villa, who had married Hugh's sister Sachette."
"Nikli, known in Antiquity as Tegea, is located on the southern Arcadian plain and was conquered by the Franks after a siege sometime before 1209; at the time it was a town of some importance and the seat of a bishopric, which was taken over by a Latin bishop until 1222, when it was abolished and joined to that of Lacedaemon. Nikli's location made it an excellent assembly point for armies, as well as for parliaments like the famous ""Ladies' Parliament"" in 1261, but after 1262, when the Byzantines recovered parts of the southeastern Peloponnese, the barony became a battleground, and by the early 1270s, Nikli was permanently garrisoned to prevent the Byzantines from breaking out of their territory in Laconia into the central Arcadian plateau. Nikli was still in Frankish hands in 1280, but was lost to the resurgent Byzantines sometime after. The Aragonese version of the ""Chronicle"" states that the Byzantines occupied the town in 1296, but, it being indefensible on account of its location on the plain, they preferred to destroy and abandon it. The region seems to have remained under Frankish control for a few years after that, but by 1302, it was definitely in Byzantine hands."

"Raniero Capocci, also known as Ranieri, Rainerio da Viterbo ( 1180-1190 – 27 May 1250) was an Italian cardinal and military leader, a fierce adversary of emperor Frederick II."
"Capocci was born at Viterbo in 1180–1190. Few details exist about his early life, and his alleged adherence to the Cistercian Order, including the role of abbot in the Tre Fontane Abbey in Rome, is unconfirmed. He entered the Roman curia before 1215, the year in which Pope Innocent III sent him to the Abbey of Montecassino to investigate about abbot Adenulf's tenure. In 1216 Capocci was created cardinal deacon of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, and later became papal legate to Lombardy."
"Innocent's successor, Honorius III, appointed Capocci as ""rector"" of the Duchy of Spoleto, and later of the areas of Assisi, Nocera Umbra and Gubbio. In 1231 he became cardinal protodeacon."
"In 1234 the new pope Gregory IX named Capocci ""rector"" of Tuscia (Tuscany), as well as ""capitano"" (commander) of the Papal troops. In the same year Luca Savelli, grandson of Honorius III, forced the pope to flee from Rome to Umbria. Emperor (and King of Naples and Sicily) Frederick II moved from southern Italy with an army to help Gregory, joining Capocci's troops at Montefiascone. Savelli's army was besieged in a fortress a few kilometers south of Viterbo and, although Frederick left the siege in advance, Capocci was able to defeat them. Frederick's ambiguous behaviour led to his excommunication by Gregory four years later, and Capocci defended the pope's move with a series of letters and treatises disseminated throughout Europe, including the manifesto ""Ascendit de mare""."
"When Gregory died in 1241, Capocci was jailed by the Roman senator Matteo Rosso Orsini in the Septizodium. After the short reign of Celestine IV (17 days), Ranieri supported the election of a pope who would not show any compromise with Frederick II. The new pope was the Genoese Innocent IV, who would continue Gregory's anti-imperial policy. This is manifest in the events leading to the siege of Viterbo, in which Capocci was instrumental in the expulsion of the imperial garrison from the city, and in the following defeat of the rescue army led by Frederick in person. Capocci was left in the city as papal legate with full powers (he was also bishop of Viterbo for one year)."
"In 1244 a peace treaty was signed between Innocent and Frederick. However, the latter soon began military and diplomatic moves to overthrow the pope, who decided to take refuge in Lyon, leaving Capocci as his plenipotentiary in Italy. When the news arrived that a compromise with the emperor was likely, he had a series of pamphlets, full of insults and accusations of heresy against Frederick, published in the French city: their success among the prelates in the First Council of Lyon led to the deposition of the Sicilian leader (1245). Frederick replied by re-conquering Viterbo, although Capocci was able to gain back most of Umbria and the March of Ancona, including Iesi, the emperor's birthplace. In 1246 Innocent appointed him as papal legate also in the Kingdom of Sicily."
"In October 1249, however, Innocent started to consider Capocci's power as excessive, and called him back to the Roman curia. Ranieri never accepted the decision and, now ill, moved to Lyon, where he died in 1250. He was initially buried in the Abbey of Citeaux, but later his remains were transferred to the church of Santa Maria in Gradi at Viterbo, which he had built in 1217–1221 as a gift to his personal friend, Saint Dominic."

"Bunge Church () is a medieval church in Bunge on the Swedish island of Gotland. The church seen today was largely built during the 14th century and is in a High Gothic style typical for churches on Gotland. Inside, the church is richly decorated with medieval frescos, including depictions of medieval knights whose significance remain contested. Bunge Church belongs to the Church of Sweden and lies in the Diocese of Visby (Sweden)."
"Archaeological excavations carried out in 1916 and 1971 have shown that the present, mainly Gothic church was pre-dated by a Romanesque church, dating from the 12th century. The massive, fortress-like tower of the church is somewhat later but belonged to this first edifice. The nave and choir were built in the 14th century in a form of High Gothic typical for Gotland: the nave is high and spacious, divided into two by slender columns; the choir lacks an apse; and the east end of the church instead finishes in a straight wall adorned with three slender windows."
"The church and churchyard are surrounded by a wall which originally reached much higher and had a defensive purpose. Four medieval gates still survive in the wall. The church complex evidently has fulfilled a defensive role, as there are marks from pikes and crossbow bolts in the sturdy tower-door, still preserved in its original place. In addition, the inside of the church is profusely decorated with frescos depicting, among other things, fighting knights. The frescos and the church wall may date from the short period in history when Gotland belonged to the Teutonic Order. This has led some scholars to speculate whether the church for a time might have been owned by the crusading Order, and turned into an ""Ordensburg"" (albeit on a small scale)."
The church today belongs to the Church of Sweden and lies within the Diocese of Visby.
"The church is one of the largest on northern Gotland. As mentioned, it displays a mix between Romanesque (the tower) and Gothic (the nave and choir). The church has a southern portal, rich in sculpture, and a northern portal with Romanesque details, possibly partially incorporated from the earlier church building."
"The most distinguishing feature of the interior is no doubt the richly painted walls, with frescos executed by a master painter probably from Prussia or Bohemia. These are from the late 14th century or early 15th and depict different Christian themes, like the Last Judgement, the crucifixion, a few of the apostles but also the Mass of Saint Gregory and legends of saints. As for the previously mentioned depicted knights, scholars have different views of what they may depict or represent. One theory is that they are Teutonic knights. Another claims that they represent a depiction of the Battle of Visby, while others believe they are, in line with the other paintings, representing the Christian theme of the martyrdom of the Theban Legion. A single remaining painted glass window remains, a baptismal font from the 13th century and an oddity: a mite box in stone, which is signed by the stonemason in runes, ""Lafrans made this stone""."

= = = Samuel Richardson (Baptist) = = =
"Samuel Richardson (fl. 1646) was an English layman and religious controversialist of the 1640s and 1650s, of Baptist views."
"From Northamptonshire, Richardson was probably an army preacher in the early part of the First English Civil War. He became a leading member of one of the seven Baptist churches of London: in the three confessions of faith put forth by these churches in 1643, 1644, and 1646, Richardson's signature stands beside that of John Spilsbury, minister of the congregation at Wapping."
"Richardson supported the action of the parliamentary army and the government of Oliver Cromwell, to whom he had fee access. For a time he had scruples as to the title of ""Lord Protector"", and told Cromwell so to his face; then, becoming convinced, he tried to reconcile Vavasor Powell and others to the protectorate."
"Richardson defended Baptist practices and held strongly monergistic beliefs about justification similar to those of Tobias Crisp before him, and later John Gill. Salvation is exclusively by the grace of God and never depends on human faith or works, as justification is fully achieved on the cross as a result of the eternal decree of God to save the elect."
"Richardson, as Tobias Crisp, held that the law is not necessary to bring persons to saving faith, and that the Puritan emphasis on the individual believer's consciousness of sin makes subjective sentiments the object of faith, rather than Christ: ""We have made a Christ of our works, tears, and crying long enough"", Richardson notes."
"Human works as well as faith can only be considered results of God’s work in Christ as the Holy Spirit works in those who are justified. When Paul talks of justification by faith, he by “faith” simply means Christ. We are justified by Christ alone and not by our believing, Richardson claimed. Faith is an evidence of “interest in Christ but not a joint-partner with Christ”."
"Richardson, in his Justification by Christ Alone from 1647, argued that the work of Christ alone is the means of justification:"
"“[W]e grant God has decreed the end and the means, and whatsoever God has decreed shall unavoidably come to pass. But we deny that faith is any means of our Redemption, Justification, or Salvation. Nothing but the Lord Jesus Christ is the means of our salvation. There are means that are necessary to the revealing and enjoying the comfort of it, as the Holy Spirit and ministers to reveal it and faith to receive it; also, there be fruits and effects of the love of God, as faith, love, and obedience to Christ…yet these are no means of our salvation.”"
"Though holding a position in most of his works that can be described as clearly Particular Baptist and thus Calvinistic, Richardson in his last work expressed a form of eschatological universalism."
Richardson wrote:
"To Richardson have also been ascribed tentatively ""An exact and full Relation of all the Proceedings between the Cavaliers and the Northamptonshire Forces at Banbury"", January 1643–4, signed R.

He then moved on to the Providence Grays, filling in the rotation due to injuries to their top pitchers, Charles Radbourn and Charlie Sweeney. Even though he did pitch well for long stretches during the games, he struggled to secure the victories in the late innings and had to be replaced. On July 31, 1884, in a road game versus the New York Gothams, he was appointed umpire due to the scheduled umpire calling in sick. The New York fans thought his calls were decidedly one-sided toward his Grays team, and he had to have a police escort off the field after the game. The game ended in a 3-3 tie."
"On one occasion, with Miller playing right field, the manager had wanted Sweeney to switch from pitcher to right field to bring in Miller to pitch in the 9th inning. Sweeney refused the move and walked off the field, and because of the rules during that time, Miller had to pitch the game with only two outfielders. He went on to lose the game, and Sweeney was suspended for a game to violating the manager's order. Instead of serving the suspension, Sweeney quit the team and joined the St. Louis Maroons of Union Association, leaving Radbourn to shoulder the team's pitching duties for the rest of the season. It was that season that Radbourn set his all-time record for wins with 60, which under today's rules would have only been 59 because in one game, he relieved Miller with Providence having the lead after five innings. On September 13, when the team departing on a lengthy road trip, they decided not to bring Miller along with them, thus ending his short tenure with the team. He compiled a 3–2 record with them in five starts and one relief appearance that resulted in a late-inning loss."
"He is also on record as having pitched one game for the Philadelphia Quakers during the 1884 season. In that game, he pitched a complete game loss, giving up 19 runs, 10 of them earned."
"Miller spent 1885 in the minor leagues. He started 1886 with Macon of the Southern Association but finished it with the Philadelphia Athletics of the American Association. He went 10-8 that season, completing all of his starts and throwing one shutout. On August 20, he threw a one-hitter, giving up his one hit in the ninth inning and losing 1-0 to the Baltimore Orioles, and their young fireballer Matt Kilroy. During this season, he played one game at third base, becoming one of only 36 left-handed players to have played at least one game at that position."
"Miller died at the age of 57 in New London, Connecticut, and was interred at Comstock Cemetery in Montville, Connecticut."

"The Capitanes de Arecibo are a Puerto Rican professional basketball team based in Arecibo, that competes in the Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN) league. In 2010, the team also had the distinction to play in the Premier Basketball League (PBL) under the name Capitanes de Puerto Rico. The team began play in the league in 1946. Home games are held at Manuel Iguina Coliseum, which the team shares with the Capitanes de Arecibo men's volleyball team."
"The team has won seven BSN Championships (1959, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2016 and 2018) and has had a total 16 finals appearances, being a runner-up 9 times (1932, 1946, 1948, 1961, 1966, 1992, 2007, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2017). Capitanes is the only team to participate in all editions of the FIBA Americas League, having entered the final four twice (finishing 2nd in 2010 and 3rd in 2013)."
"In 1946, coached by Wilfredo Franco, Tingo Díaz, Piro Méndez and for a pre-Olympic tournament, the Capitanes emerged. A group of young athletes, mostly from Arecibo, like: Manuel Gilberto (Petaca) Iguina, Quicón Iguina, Abdiel de la Rosa, Alberto Renta, Joaquín Balaguer, Armando Villamil, y Pipe Beníquez showed themselves to be a part of it and dominated the sport in Puerto Rico, finishing in second place."
"On August 19, 1959, the Capitanes won their first basketball championship against the Rio Piedras Cardinals at the Rodríguez Olmo Stadium in Arecibo. They were coached by Lou Rossinni, and the heroes of that series were Jaime Frontera, Francisco Pancho Padilla, Felipito Colón, Bill MacCadney, José (Fufi) Santori Coll, Moisés Navedo, José Rodríguez Gómez, Eddie Martínez, José Vázquez, José Aponte, Angel Morales, Jaime Miranda, Joe Phillip Padilla hijo, Ramón Siraguza, Enrique Miranda, and Sitín García. This team is the only team in BSN history to have gone the entire season, including the playoffs, undefeated."
"In 1992, coached by Alfred “Butch” Lee, the Capitanes returned to the BSN Finals with elite players Ferdinand Morales, Rafael Hernandez, Giovanni Colón, Fitz Roy Brow, Juan Griles, Orlando Febres, Bryan and Mark Santiago, losing a hard-fought series against the Ponce Lions."
"The Capitanes in 2002 wrote another page in the history of their city and the BSN when the so-called ""kids"" broke the predictions of the media and basketball analysts by taking a semi-final series to Game 7 with young talents Giovanni Jiménez, Rick Apodaca, Buster Figueroa, Pachy Cruz and David Cortes; and veterans Félix Javier Perez, Javier Rolón and Oscar Chiaramello."
"In 2005, general manager Regino Babilonia hired Carlos Mario Rivera as head coach and the Captains again won the BSN Championship (4-0) over the Bayamón Cowboys."
"In 2007, with David Rosario at the command of the Captain Ship, and the fiery players Rafael “Pachy” Cruz, Ángel “Buster” Figueroa, David Cortes, Carlos Payano and Marcus Fizer as reinforcement, the Capitanes returned to the BSN Finals. In a historic, sold-out Game 7 at the Jose Miguel Agrelot Coliseum, where 75% of the attendees were from Captain Correa City, the Arecibo Captains came back from a 20-point fourth-quarter deficit to force an overtime. In a hard-fought and emotional series of plays and calls, the Captains came up just short of another championship."
"During the 2008 season, the Capitanes advanced again to the finals against the Carolina Giants. The series went to seven games, with both teams winning three games at home. Arecibo won the seventh game, 99-94, for the third championship in the franchise's history. Ángel Figueroa was selected the Finals' Most Valuable Player."
"It was forty-six years since the Captains succeeded in that first championship. That was on August 19, 1959. They came short in 1966 when they lost in overtime against Ponce and in a seventh game finals held at the court of Manuel Carrasquillo Herpen Country Club. In 1992 the attorney Hiram Ruiz saw the Lions come from behind in the series to thwart another major celebration in Arecibo."
"In 2005, there were doubts. However, unlike the team of 1959, the 2005 edition played with many ups and downs during the regular season and also in the ""round robin"", for example beating the best in the league but losing to last-placed teams. The reason for not dominating as expected was the failure of the team's ""Refuerzo"" (reinforcement player), former rebounding leader and prolific scorer, center Nick Davis, who did not meet the team and fan's expectations, as well as his following replacements until the arrival of Richard Lugo."
"In the ""round robin"" the Captains won five and lost as many games. The team was torn between changing Dickey Simpkins or staying with the player that looked more like a fifth man with the added reinforcement that was hurt."
"With all that were chosen as a finalist in the analyzes that the Cowboys favored above all others for having excelled in the second stage of the tournament. Unlike the 1959 champion who went undefeated, these Captains had to earn their stripes."
The Captains got a breaks with the elimination of Ponce. The Lions were the best team that could match-up with the Captains and successfully handle the full-court press.
"The Captains then faced a remodeled Santurce, with former Nigerian NBA player Olumide Oyedeji. The series became complicated and unpredictable."
It was then that Edgar Padilla appeared on the scene.

"Robert Ernest Keeton (December 16, 1919 – July 2, 2007) was an American lawyer, jurist, and legal scholar. As a law professor at Harvard Law School and a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts he was known for his work on torts, insurance law, and practical courtroom tactics. Keeton, with Jeffrey O'Connell of the University of Virginia School of Law, played a key role in the advancement of no-fault automobile insurance."
"Keeton was born in Clarksville, Texas. He was the second youngest of five children of William Keeton (who owned a general store) and Ernestine Teuton Keeton. One of his brothers, W. Page Keeton, also became a prominent lawyer and educator. Keeton earned his Bachelor of Business Administration from the University of Texas at Austin and his Bachelor of Laws from the University of Texas School of Law. As an undergraduate he became one of three students inducted into the Friar Society, an honor society at the University of Texas. In law school he was the assistant editor-in-chief of the ""Texas Law Review"". Keeton went into private practice with the law firm of Baker & Botts in Houston before joining the United States Navy in World War II. As a lieutenant serving aboard the escort aircraft carrier USS ""Liscome Bay"" (CVE-56) he survived the sinking of the ship on November 24, 1943, by a torpedo from the Japanese submarine I-175. Keeton, clinging to debris for hours, was later pulled from the ocean. He was awarded a Purple Heart. Keeton returned to Baker & Botts in 1945 after the war. He later taught at Southern Methodist University."
"Keeton joined Harvard Law School in 1953, where he would remain until 1979. In 1954, he wrote ""Trial Tactics and Methods"", a book of practical advice on courtroom skills. Keeton later developed a program at Harvard (later used at other law schools) in which experienced trial lawyers taught students. One rule of Keeton's program was to not ask hostile witnesses open-ended questions. In 1956, Keeton received his Doctor of Juridical Science from Harvard. In 1973, he was named the Langdell Professor of Law. Keeton served as associate dean from 1975–1979. In the early 1970s, Keeton worked with University of Virginia School of Law professor Jeffrey O'Connell on a study that contributed to the development of no-fault automobile insurance, later adopted by many states. Under a no-fault system, damages below a certain level are paid by insurance companies, thus avoiding a determination of who was at fault."
"Keeton was nominated by President Jimmy Carter on January 25, 1979, to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, to a new seat authorized by 92 Stat. 1629. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 21, 1979, and received his commission on March 23, 1979. He assumed senior status on February 28, 2003. His service terminated on September 8, 2006, due to retirement. In 1979 Chief Justice Warren Burger appointed him chair of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Judicial Conference of the United States, a body responsible for developing the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure."
"Keeton presided over the 1988-1989 mail fraud and obstruction of justice trial of Lyndon LaRouche and eleven associates, which ended with Keeton declaring a mistrial. He also presided over the 1995 ""Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc."" trial involving the extent of software copyright, a case that later was decided by the Supreme Court. In 1984 Keeton, along with older brother Page as lead author, and professors Dan Dobbs and David Owen, published the 5th edition of ""Prosser and Keeton on Torts"". The book, based on William Prosser's influential ""Prosser on Torts"" (1941), became a foundational text of tort law and has become frequently used as a law textbook and reference work for many law students, lawyers, and jurists."

The films relate exclusively to the family's expeditions in Africa during this time. The original films are held in the British Film Institute archives, and the Powell-Cotton Museum own copies contemporaneous with the originals."
"Between 1887 and 1939 Major Percy H G Powell-Cotton undertook a total of 28 expeditions to Africa and Asia. Alongside the extensive collection of game and animal specimens he bought back, Major Powell-Cotton also shot several reels of 16mm film footage whilst out in the bush."
"His films mainly depict African game and wildlife, as well as market scenes, craft making and tribal ceremonies from the African rural communities. One particular film, ""Gorilla Drive, Cameroons"", is believed to be the only one of its subject from this date in existence. It shows the mustering of the animals by the local people, their herding and despatch by the natives with spears."
"Powell-Cotton made 17 films in total, either independently or together with his daughter Diana or wife Hannah. All the films are 16mm black and white silent films, made in a non-narrative documentary style. The major also shot all his films using a handheld, windup Bell & Howell Filmo 70 camera, which is currently on display in the Powell-Cotton museum. The first recorded use of colour film was in 1950’s in the film ""South Africa: Victoria Falls & Livingstone Game Park"" made by Christopher and Diana Powell-Cotton."
"Most of the films in the collection were made for private viewing only and for the purposes recording keeping from the expeditions. However, Major Powell-Cotton did present several of his films to the Royal Anthropological Institute in 1932, including ""Crafts in the Cameroons"" (1931) and ""Osonigbe Juju House and Benin Brass Cutting"" (1931)."
"The most notable films of the collection are those by Major Powell-Cotton’s daughters, Diana and Antoinette Powell-Cotton from their expeditions to Angola in 1936 and 1937."
"The result of their trips was just under three hours of edited black-and-white 16mm film, accompanied by nearly 3,000 objects and 2,000 photographs. The films portray local ceremonies, craft-working and family life in rural Africa. Together they provide a unique record of the region at a crucial time in its history, before the full impact of the massive cultural changes brought about by missionization and colonial rule."
"Diana and Antoinette filmed their entire footage on a single, small windup Kodak cine camera which is currently on display in the Powell-Cotton museum. The sisters were not able to review or edit any footage on location, and so were constantly anxious they had not captured the events and activities in Angola successfully. They only edited their footage on their return, and would give private viewings accompanied by music and live narration to family members in their screen room which is now Gallery 4 in the Powell-Cotton museum."
"Also in 1981, William Bennett, head of the band Whitehouse and the British Come Org. label, offered Bianchi a record contract, which Bianchi signed unchecked. It was based on a ""joke contract"" that Steven Stapleton of Nurse With Wound had sketched. The contract assumed all rights to Bianchi's work. After delivery of the tapes Bennett edited-in speeches by Nazi leaders, and instead of the relatively unsensational name MB, it was published under the alias ""Leibstandarte SS MB"", named after the SS unit that worked as bodyguards to Adolf Hitler."

"At FIFA's centennial congress they made one award for every decade of their existence. These awards were also handed out to fans, organisations, clubs, and one to African Football. These were referred to as the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit."

= = = Fadeaway = = =
"A fadeaway or fall-away in basketball is a jump shot taken while jumping backwards, away from the basket. The goal is to create space between the shooter and the defender, making the shot much harder to block."
"The shooter must have very good accuracy (much higher than when releasing a regular jump shot) and must use more strength (to counteract the backwards momentum) in a relatively short amount of time. Also, because the movement is away from the basket, the shooter has less chance to grab his own rebound."
"The shooting percentage is lower in fadeaway (because of the difficulty of the shot) and the shooter cannot get his own rebound. This leads many coaches and players to believe it is one of the worst shots in the game to take. However, once mastered, it is one of the hardest methods of shooting for defenders to block. The threat of a fadeaway forces a defender to jump into the shooter, and with a pump fake, the shooter can easily get a foul on the defender."
"Only a handful of great NBA players have been successful shooting fadeaways. Michael Jordan was one of the most popular shooters of the fadeaway. Wilt Chamberlain, Patrick Ewing, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Hakeem Olajuwon, Dwyane Wade, Karl Malone, Larry Bird, Carmelo Anthony, DeMar DeRozan, and LaMarcus Aldridge are also well known for using this move. The even more difficult one-legged fadeaway has become Dirk Nowitzki's signature move and has been called by LeBron James the second most unstoppable move ever, only behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's skyhook."

"Early lenses suffered from flare and low contrast, worsening as the number of lens-air interfaces increased. The introduction of and improvements in anti-reflective coatings vastly reduced flare; some many-element lens designs which had been abandoned due to low contrast in spite of otherwise excellent performance became practical."
"Lenses designed for use with monochromatic film, first orthochromatic, then panchromatic, had less exacting requirements regarding chromatic aberrations than when colour film is used. When using older lenses today one should check that chromatic aberrations and flare are acceptable for the application."

The Cordoba was capable of hunting in a small pack of a male and female; otherwise it was likely to turn on its packmates."
"The Dogo Argentino is directly derived from this breed. In the 1920s, breeders developed the Dogo Argentino by crossing the Cordoba Fighting Dog with other breeds such as the Great Dane, Great Pyrenees, Bulldog, Bull Terrier and Dogue de Bordeaux."

"Tadeusz Stefan Zieliński (; ; near Uman, Kiev Governorate, Russian Empire, September 14, 1859 – May 8, 1944, Schondorf, Upper Bavaria) was a prominent Polish classical philologist, historian, translator of Sophocles, Euripides and other classical authors into Russian."
"He was author of works on the history of ancient Greek culture and religion, classical education, and popularization of classical studies (published largely in Russian and German)."
"He was professor at the University of St. Petersburg (1890–1922), then at Warsaw University for 17 years (1922–1939) in the interwar Poland, and recipient of honorary doctorates from the Jagiellonian University, Kraków (1930), and twelve western European universities. Between 1933–1939 Zieliński was a member of the prestigious Polish Academy of Literature."
"Although Zieliński was active in many areas of classical scholarship, one of the studies for which he is best known in the west is his investigation of the prose rhythm of Cicero, published in 1904 and which is still often referred to today. (See Clausula (rhetoric))."

The Chebyshev linkage is a mechanical linkage that converts rotational motion to approximate straight-line motion.
"It was invented by the nineteenth-century mathematician Pafnuty Chebyshev, who studied theoretical problems in kinematic mechanisms. One of the problems was the construction of a linkage that converts a rotary motion into an approximate straight-line motion. This was also studied by James Watt in his improvements to the steam engine."
"The straight-line linkage confines the point ""P"" – the midpoint on the link ""L"" – on a straight line at the two extremes and at the center of travel. (""L"", ""L"", ""L"", and ""L"" are as shown in the illustration.) Between those points, point ""P"" deviates slightly from a perfect straight line. The proportions between the links are"
"Point P is in the middle of ""L"". This relationship assures that the link ""L"" lies vertically when it is at one of the extremes of its travel."
The lengths are related mathematically as follows:
"It can be shown that if the base proportions described above are taken as lengths, then for all cases,"
"and this contributes to the perceived straight-line motion of point ""P""."
"The motion of the linkage can be constrained to an input angle that may be changed through velocities, forces, etc. The input angles can be either link ""L"" with the horizontal or link ""L"" with the horizontal. Regardless of the input angle, it is possible to compute the motion of two end-points for link ""L"" that we will name A and B, and the middle point P."
"while the motion of point B will be computed with the other angle,"
"And ultimately, we will write the output angle in terms of the input angle,"
"Consequently, we can write the motion of point P, using the two points defined above and the definition of the middle point."

From through , Lanier played for the San Francisco Giants (1964–71) and New York Yankees (1972–73). He is the son of Max Lanier, a former MLB All-Star pitcher."
"In his rookie season Lanier posted a career-high .274 batting average for the San Francisco Giants and was selected for the 1964 ""Topps"" All-Star Rookie team."
"In 1968, Lanier led NL shortstops in putouts (282) and fielding average (.979). After that, he moved from second base to shortstop, and finally to third base. He also played in part of two seasons with the New York Yankees."
"In a 10-season career, Lanier was a .228 hitter with eight home runs and 273 RBI in 1196 games played. In each of the three seasons from 1967 to 1969 he ranked last among NL qualifiers in average, on-base percentage, and slugging percentage."
"Following his playing career, Lanier managed in the minors and served as third base coach for the St. Louis Cardinals from 1981–85, including the 1982 World Series and National League champion teams. He then went on to manage the Houston Astros from 1986–88 and had a 254-232 win-loss record. In 1986, he was named NL Manager of the Year by the BBWA and ""TSN"" for leading the Astros to their first Division Title since 1980 and the best record (96-66) in team history up to that point. A power struggle between Lanier and Astros' general manager Dick Wagner in 1987 eventually led to Wagner leaving the team."
"In 1988, the Astros lost a home game to the San Francisco Giants. As the team prepared to eat the post-game meal, take showers, and go home, they received word they were wanted back on the field. Lanier brought out the batting cage and ordered the team to take batting practice again. Lanier was fired at the end of the season."
"In recent years, Lanier has managed in the independent minor leagues. He managed for the Winnipeg Goldeyes in the Northern League for several years, then moved to the Can-Am League to manage the Sussex Skyhawks. While with the Skyhawks, Lanier led the team to the league championship in 2008 over the Quebec Capitales in the Can-Am League Championship Series.

She withdrew from the endorsement process after the third ballot after falling behind Kelley, with Hatch's vote total increasing. She subsequently ran an opposition campaign against Hatch in the September primary, losing with 24% of the popular vote."
"Lourey's gubernatorial campaign health care platform was the Health Care Security Plan, which included the details to put a universal health coverage system in place in Minnesota by 2010. That system would have been voluntary, not mandatory as was the Massachusetts health program that was enacted into law in Spring 2006. The platform also included other state-level health reform proposals, including the current Minnesota Medical Association's proposal."

Under her Health Care Security Plan, all Minnesotans would have been eligible to join the new MinnesotaCare by 2010. Employers could participate by offering their employer plan via the new BusinessCare program to be created as part of the revised MinnesotaCare.

"St Mark's was founded by the Reverend Charles Tooth as a centre of worship for Anglo-Catholic members of the Anglican Church in Florence. He started a house church at 1 Via dei Serragli in 1877 to teach Anglo-Catholic principles and celebrate the Holy Eucharist daily during the week. In 1880, Tooth purchased a 15th-century palazzo to meet the new congregation's needs. John Roddam Spencer Stanhope designed and created the wall and ceiling decorations at his own expense. The first Holy Eucharist was celebrated there on 1 May 1881, although chaplain and church were not licensed for service by the bishop until 1884. The premises were extended by the purchase of 16 Via Maggio in 1906."

"The Imperial Monumental Halls and Tower was a proposed Gothic complex designed for a site in London adjacent to Westminster Abbey. The plans, exhibited at the Royal Academy in March 1904, included a tower that would have dominated the Clock Tower and Victoria Tower of the nearby Houses of Parliament. It was never built."
"The design by John Pollard Seddon – then diocesan architect for London – and Edward Beckitt Lamb (son of Edward Buckton Lamb) was based on earlier schemes that each had proposed separately, and was one of many extensions proposed for Westminster Abbey in late 19th and early 20th centuries by architects such as George Gilbert Scott, George John Shaw Lefevre, James Fergusson, and Henry Travis. In particular, the clergy at Westminster Abbey were concerned that the church was becoming crowded with monuments, and more space was needed. Some of the proposed designs were considered by a Royal Commission in 1891. The issue was given added impetus after the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in August 1902 by a desire for Westminster Abbey to become a fitting Imperial monument, to compete with the baroque St Paul's Cathedral where Queen Victoria had commemorated her Diamond Jubilee in 1897."
"The architects aspired to create a grand and expensive monument to ""form a worthy centre to the metropolis of the Empire 'upon which the sun never sets' "" ."
"The complex was planned to be joined to the Great Cloister of Westminster Abbey, leading to a reception hall beneath the tower, with the main body of the building - the Great Monumental Hall - stretching along Great College Street, incorporating smaller side halls. The halls would have ended with a double transept at the south end, wide and deep."
"The soaring Memorial Tower included a high-level open ambulatory, surmounted by a corona topped by a lantern with bells. It was intended to hold monuments and imperial trophies in galleries on the lower floors, with archives on the upper floors."
"It would have been the tallest building in the UK, significantly higher than the dome of St Paul's Cathedral. The complex would have had a similar floor area to Westminster Abbey itself, and would have overshadowed the Houses of Parliament close by."
"The scheme of work would have included the completion of the tower over the crossing at Westminster Abbey. ""The Builder"" magazine criticised the scheme as exhibiting a degree of megalomania ."

"Vokrug sveta (, literally: ""Around the World"") is a Russian geographic magazine. It is the longest running magazine in the Russian language. The first issue was printed in Saint Petersburg, in December 1861, almost thirty years before the establishment of the ""National Geographic Magazine"". Thus, it is one of the oldest popular science magazines in the world. Release of ""Vokrug sveta"" was suspended twice: from 1918 to 1927, during the Russian Revolution, and from 1941 to 1945, during World War II. Nevertheless, the magazine always resumed and continues to be published to this day."
"The magazine was conceived by a Warsaw-born entrepreneur, Boleslaw Wolf, who defined ""Vokrug Sveta"" as a lavishly illustrated yearly publication, dedicated to ""physical geography, natural sciences, the most recent discoveries, inventions and observations"". Its roster of authors included: Alfred Brehm, Camille Flammarion, Nikolai Przhevalsky and Nicholai Miklukho-Maklai."
"The Wolf edition was discontinued after 1868 for unclear reasons, but the project of a popular geographical journal was revived in 1885 by Ivan Sytin, a printer who directed his periodicals toward a wider audience. Sytin's ""Vokrug sveta"" was issued monthly and featured original translations of popular adventure fiction from such authors as Jules Verne, Rudyard Kipling and Arthur Conan Doyle."
"The Russian Revolution brought this period of the magazine's history to an abrupt termination. Like many other periodicals of Imperial Russia, ""Vokrug sveta"" suspended publication for ten years. It was back in print under the auspices of the Young Communist League, specifically targeted toward the youth audience. Contributing editors included some of the finest Soviet science fiction authors, including Alexander Belayev, Vladimir Obruchev and Ivan Yefremov. In 1938, the magazine's headquarters relocated, from Leningrad to Moscow and its publication was altogether suspended during World War II."
"For Soviet readers, ""Vokrug sveta"" represented a rare source of authentic, fully illustrated information about foreign cultural attractions. This is despite the insistence of Soviet officials that the magazine should cover domestic tourist attractions, rather than those situated outside the USSR. In the 1960s and 1970s, the magazine continued to grow in popularity and increased the circulation to 2,300,000 copies by 1971. A television subsidiary was also popular, particularly in the early 1990s. As of 2007, ""Vokrug sveta"" ranks third among Russia's popular monthlies, with a circulation hovering around 250,000.

"Morning Call is an American TV business program that aired on CNBC, from 10AM to 12 noon ET weekdays. The show premiered as ""Midday Call"" on February 4, 2002, offered a clear focus on real-time market coverage at the heart of the trading day. Previous programs shown in the same time slot were ""The Money Wheel"" with Ted David and Martha MacCallum (who later joined Fox News Channel) and ""Market Watch"". The program last aired August 8, 2007."
"On February 3, 2006, Ted David, who had co-anchored ""Morning Call"" with Liz Claman since 2003, left the program while being promoted to senior anchor at CNBC Business Radio. From 2006-02-06 to 2007-07-17, Claman was joined in the 10-11am hour by Mark Haines (who reported from the New York Stock Exchange), and in the 11am-noon hour by various anchors, including Dylan Ratigan (see anchor roster below)."
"On July 20, 2007, CNBC replaced the first hour of the two-hour program with an expanded ""Squawk on the Street"", due in part to Claman's departure from the network (which she joined Fox News Channel's sister network financial unit three months later). Dylan Ratigan and Trish Regan served as interim anchors for the program, which was completely revamped on 2007-07-23. In addition to the aforementioned 2007-07-23 revamp, the anchors were joined on set by a guest contributor, very similar to ""Squawk Box""."
"On August 8, 2007, the show was renamed—and replaced—by ""The Call"". The name change to ""The Call"" with Dylan Ratigan (who left the show in late 2008 and was replaced by Larry Kudlow), Melissa Francis, and Trish Regan on that date was due in part to avoid confusion with the early-morning Bloomberg Television program of the same name."
"The following segments below were carried over to ""The Call"" as of 2007-08-08:"
"The following segments below moved to the second hour of ""Squawk on the Street"" as of 2007-07-23:"

She was joined on location at the NYMEX by Sharon Epperson on the day the weekly crude oil, gasoline, distillate, and natural gas inventories report were released by the EIA."
"The Gewerkschaft Deutscher Lokomotivführer (GDL, engl.: ""German Train Drivers' Union"") is a German trade union that represents workers in train companies. It has a membership of 34,000."
"In August 2007 the GDL planned to strike after talks failed with Deutsche Bahn, the main German railway operator, over a range of demands from the union. A key disagreement was GDL's wish to represent its members in collective bargaining processes, independently of other unions representing staff in that job category."
"On 8 August 2007, the labour court in Nuremberg declared that a strike of affected long-distance and goods services would be illegal if carried out before 30 September, claiming it would affect the national economy too severely."
"On 2 November 2007, the labour court in Chemnitz overturned a previous judgement limiting strike action to short-haul routes. After the decision the GDL declared a three-day strike. It was the first national rail strike since 1992 and of unprecedented duration. The strike ended as the union had planned, at 2:00 a.m. CET on the morning of Saturday, November 17, 2007, but without a new contract."
"On 19 November 2007 the labour court in Nuremberg admonished Deutsche Bahn for its practice of contacting multiple labour courts around the country to try and obtain an injunction against strike action, which it regarded as misuse of the legal system."
"In 2014 the GDL started a series of strikes of the German railway system as a result of Deutsche Bahn declining its demands for a shorter working week (reduced from 39 hours to 37 hours), for a 5% pay increase and for the right to independently represent 17,000 railway workers not working as engine drivers in collective bargaining processes. Deutsche Bahn maintained that it would only enter collective bargaining with a single trade union per job grouping, as was the case until June 2014 when GDL had an agreement with the much larger EVG union."
"The strikes continued in 2015 with a three-day railway strike starting on 21 April 2015, the GDL's seventh strike in 10 months. This was followed by a strike from 4–10 May, the longest strike in Deutsche Bahn's history. A further strike started on 19 May 2015 and finished on 21 May as the GDL and Deutsche Bahn agreed to allow arbitration to resolve the conflict."

"Daishōhō Masami (7 May 1967 – 4 December 1999) was a sumo wrestler from Hokkaidō, Japan. His highest rank was ""komusubi."""
"Born in Sapporo, he took up skiing as a young boy, as he came from an area famous for its ski slopes. He also played basketball at school. However his father was an amateur sumo enthusiast and encouraged his son to try the sport. In his third year of junior high he took part in the National Junior High School Sumo Championships, held in Tokyo, and was put up in Tatsunami stable during the championships. Daishoho was an amateur sumo champion at Nihon University, and after graduation he returned to Tatsunami stable. He entered professional sumo in January 1990 at the ""makushita"" level, and quickly reached the top ""makuuchi"" division in July 1991. His best performance in a tournament was in September 1992 when he was runner-up to Takahanada with 11 wins. He reached his highest rank of ""komusubi"" in January 1993, but after that he was plagued by a number of injuries to his knees, back and triceps. He fell back to the ""jūryō"" division after pulling out of the January 1997 tournament on the 4th day."
"In 1999 Daishoho was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He wanted to receive treatment whilst still remaining active on the ""dohyo"", but in June he was persuaded by his doctors to enter hospital full-time and so retired from sumo. Since it was clear that he would be unlikely to live long enough to have a formal retirement ceremony (""danpatsu-shiki"") at the Ryogoku Kokugikan, which normally takes place up to a year after retiring, in October 1999 his fellow wrestler and graduate of Nihon University Mainoumi organised a private function for him which was attended by around 400 people including wrestlers such as Konishiki and Musashimaru and his former stablemaster Haguroyama, although senior members of the Sumo Association and his former coach at Nihon University Hidetoshi Tanaka did not attend as it was an unsanctioned event. Daishoho's weight had dropped from 150 kg to below 90 kg. He died on December 4, 1999 at the age of 32 due to pancreatic cancer."
"Daishoho liked pushing techniques, particularly ""tsuppari"", a series of rapid thrusts to the chest. However, he was also good at fighting on the ""mawashi"" or belt, where he preferred a ""migi-yotsu"" grip, a left hand outside and right hand inside position. His most commonly used ""kimarite"" were ""yorikiri"" (force out), ""oshidashi"" (push out) and ""uwatenage"" (overarm throw)."

Louis van Gasteren was present at the opening and afterwards was interviewed by journalist Raymond van den Boogaard. On November 30 there was a public interview with the author by television critic Hans Beerekamp from NRC Handelsblad."
"Vimeo.com called the film ""a journey in spiritual and geographical terms"" and Realtofilm.nl wrote, ""The film not only gives a peak into a fascinating era, it is a highly original autobiographical portrait."" Some reviews were negative. Yara Plasman of Filmtotaal.nl described the film as ""a veritable hotch-potch/jumble of various images, sometimes spontaneous while at other times obviously enacted, with or without a clear storyline . . ."""
"Principal photography for ""Nema"" began in 1964 in the Netherlands and lasted five years as Louis raised money as he went. Filming eventually covered ten countries. Jan de Bont was the cinematographer on the principal scenes of the film, including scenes in New York, Vancouver, San Francisco, Timothy Leary in Millbrook, and Meher Baba in India. Additional cameramen during the very long shooting period included Milek Knebel, Theo Hogers, Roeland Kerbosch, Olof Smit, Bert Spijkerman, Louis van Gasteren, and Kester Dixon (for final filming in 2012)."
"Van Gasteren worked hard to get an interview with Meher Baba for ""Nema aviona za Zagreb"". In 1967 Meher Baba was near the end of his life and in strict seclusion. Through the help of numerous contacts with people he met in his travels who had met Baba in the 60s, including Irwin Luck, Rick Chapman, and Robert Dreyfuss, Van Gasteren was at last able to reach Baba's secretary and arrange a meeting. Van Gasteren told Baba, ""The appearance of the Avatar in my film is more than functional, it is necessary, to give all the other happenings and sequences the final and right dimension."" The terms were that the shooting could only take place on September 20, 1967, during a short period when Baba would be coming out of seclusion for three hours in order to wash the feet of seven lepers, the last of such an occasion in Baba's life. Van Gasteren was told that if he was there on time, he could film and interview Baba. Van Gasteren arrived in Bombay on September 17, and at Meherazad at precisely 9:00 A.M. on September 19, accompanied by cameraman Jan de Bont and soundman Peter Brugman, and was shown around the location in preparation for the following day's shoot and met Baba. The following day, September 20, the crew filmed forty minutes of film footage of Baba and the surrounding area, including the interview seen in the film. About half of this footage was released in the 1997 documentary, ""Beyond Words""."
"Filming stalled in 1969. After two attempts to complete the film in the 70s and 80s, a final attempt to edit the film was begun in 2009 by filmmaker and editor Ilja Lammers who began to gather and assemble the material. The 35mm film was digitized by EYE Film Institute Netherlands in 2010. Completion financing was received from Netherlands Film Fund and EYE Film Institute and the film was finished in 2012, 48 years after principal photography began. The film premiered at EYE on Van Gasteren's 90th birthday. Gasteren was present at the opening."

"""Hello"" is a song by American recording artist Kelly Clarkson, from her fifth studio album, ""Stronger"" (2011). Written by Clarkson, Josh Abraham, Oliver Goldstein, and Bonnie McKee, with production by Abraham and Oligee, ""Hello"" is a midtempo rock song about searching for companionship in hopes of not being lonely, in which the singer asks, ""Hello? Is anybody listening?"""
"Upon its release, ""Hello"" was received with positive reception from music critics, who regarded it as a vocal highlight of ""Stronger"". Boosted by digital sales during the album's release, the song entered the South Korean Singles Chart at number 47. Clarkson has also performed it a limited live performance during her Stronger Tour in 2012."
"""Hello"" was written by Kelly Clarkson Josh Abraham, Oliver Goldstein, and Bonnie McKee, with Abraham and Goldstein (as Ollgee) handling the song's production. During the summer of 2011, Clarkson and McKee had collaborated on tracks such as ""Hello"" and ""Alone"", intending it to be recorded for Clarkson's fifth studio album, ""Stronger"", which was released on October of that same year. An acoustic version of the ""Hello"" was included as the opening track of her first extended play, ""The Smoakstack Sessions"" (2011)."
"Written in the key of E minor, ""Hello"" is a midtempo rock song with guitar chords and its hand claps. According to the sheet music published by Kobalt Music Publishing, Clarkson's voice range featured in the song spans from A to E. Jarett Wieselman of ""omg! Insider"" noted that its chord progression is similar to Katy Perry's single ""Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)"" (2011), a track also written by McKee."
"""Hello"" has received positive reviews from music critics. Jason Lipshutz of ""Billboard"" described it as ""a slightly more rugged track that finds its groove in the chorus. The handclaps on the bridge are a nice touch"" and added that the song ""is gonna be a killer in concert."" ""Seattle Post-Intelligencer""s Jason Scott described ""Hello"" as a ""Fun"" and ""cool"" track. He compared it to tracks recorded on ""All I Ever Wanted"" (2009) and noted that the track relies ""solely on the ""O"" vowel to tell a story. ""Ignorance isn't wise, but it beats being alone,"" Clarkson sings before asking if anybody is listening. We hear you loud and clear!"" Brian Mansfield of ""USA Today"" considered ""Hello"" as a vocal highlight of ""Stronger"", he wrote in his review: ""this rock tune sounds happier than its lyrics, which depict Kelly as feeling alone even when she's not by herself."" Sam Lansky of PopCrush compared it to ""Mr. Know It All"", and described it as a '90s throwback. He wrote, definitely works, especially with the hooky chorus and heartbroken ferocity of the bridge: ""Holding onto the memories of when I, I didn't know / Ignorance isn't wise but it beats being alone."" Ryan Pearson of ""The Huffington Post"" noted that ""there is an undertone of loneliness and sadness coursing throughout, including some downbeat lyrics co-written by Clarkson herself. ""Hello, is anybody listening? Won't somebody show me that I'm not alone,"" she sings on ""Hello""."""

"Using the name Max Keller in 1979, he moved to New York City, where he did a few minor bit parts on a few daytime soaps."
"Klinton Spilsbury's dialogue in ""The Legend of the Lone Ranger"" was dubbed by actor James Keach. Considerable controversy surrounded Spilsbury at the time of the film's release, in part because of the studio's treatment of Clayton Moore, star of the popular 1950s TV series, who was prevented through legal action from wearing his black mask during personal appearances. Controversy also was due to Spilsbury's on-set antics, which included fighting with crew members and being uncooperative and combative during the production. It was the only film Spilsbury made. For his performance in this film, Spilsbury received the 1981 Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor."
"Andy Warhol interviewed Spilsbury during his promotion tour, later describing the interview as ""nutty,"" because Spilsbury was ""blowing his whole image"" during their conversation. Spilsbury told Warhol that, before making the movie, he had been an art student married to a rich woman and that they had a baby together. He went on to state that they did not spend much time together because he needed too much time with his own thoughts, a detail that Warhol found amusing. Spilsbury told Warhol that he was a friend of actor Dennis Christopher and had fallen in love with him, and that he also had later fallen in love with actor Bud Cort. Warhol described Spilsbury as ""very drunk"" during the latter part of the interview, and the latter also mentioned that ""he'd been picked up by Halston and woke up in bed with Halston."""

"""Let's Go to Bed"" is a song by English rock band the Cure, released as a stand-alone single by Fiction Records in November 1982. In the aftermath of the dark ""Pornography"", Robert Smith returned from a month-long detox in the Lake District to write the song, the antithesis to what the Cure currently represented. It was later included on the album ""Japanese Whispers""."
"The single was a minor success in the UK (peaking at No. 44) but was a top 20 hit in both Australia and New Zealand in 1983, reaching respectively No. 15 and No. 17."
"The origins of ""Let's Go to Bed"" lie in ""Temptation"", one of the demos for ""Pornography"". The song is a relatively upbeat, guitar-driven instrumental. In August 1982, soon after Simon Gallup's departure from the band, Smith demoed a vocal version of the track, entitled ""Temptation Two"", a psychedelic piece not far removed from the ""Pornography"" album but somewhat lighter in tone. At the end of the song, Smith sings a string of wordless syllables, nearly identical to the ""doo doo doo""s of the later song. The song version was debuted on Kid Jensen's radio show on 27 November 1982, as a take which was very close to the final version that appeared as a single in the same month."
"In an interview with Rolling Stone, Robert Smith discussed the initial reaction when playing the song to Fiction Records: However, the song became a success much to Smith’s surprise. Later on in the same interview he said"
"On 15 March 1983, the song was the first broadcast for the pioneering Boston-based alternative rock radio station WFNX. When WFNX was sold and ceased broadcasting on 20 July 2012, ""Let's Go to Bed"" was selected as the station's final broadcast."
"AllMusic described the song as ""antic, herky-jerky new wave pop"", while ""Pitchfork"" called it ""bratty, funky synthpop""."
"The song's music video was the band's first collaboration with Tim Pope, who would go on to direct several more videos for the group. The video features members Robert Smith and Lol Tolhurst, who at that point were the only members of the Cure – the only instance in the band's history where the band officially had a two-person lineup. Pope’s video treatment displayed the band’s more whimsical side, something absent from the band’s early work. In his book, Tolhurst also recalls that he was dancing naked behind the screen as a shadowy silhouette."

"The Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q) was established in the 1850s to rival the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad (C&GU). The new railroad was constructed due to growing concern that the cities of Batavia and Aurora would have an economic downfall since the C&GU bypassed both settlements. The railroad station in Batavia was the first constructed by the CB&Q, and as such, the company took extra care to make it stand out architecturally."
"The wood structure stands two stories tall with red, vertical panels. Originally , a four-room extension was added to the ground floor in 1868. The main structure has a gable roof with Gothic brackets while the extension has a flat roof. The station was later abandoned by the CB&Q, who preferred to maintain only a direct route through Aurora. The station was moved to its current location in 1973 in an effort to preserve it. Renovations were made to restore the building to its 1919 appearance (which was likely very similar to the original). The building was placed on a new cinder block foundation.

"The London Underground mosquito is a form of mosquito in the genus ""Culex"". It is found in the London Underground railway system as its name suggests, but has a worldwide distribution and long predates the existence of the London Underground. It was first described as a distinct species from Egyptian specimens by the biologist Peter Forsskål (1732–1763). He named this mosquito ""Culex molestus"" due to its voracious biting, but later biologists renamed it ""Culex pipiens"" f. ""molestus"" because there were no morphological differences between it and ""Culex pipiens"". Notably, this mosquito assaulted Londoners sleeping in the Underground during the Blitz, although similar populations were long known."
"A study from 2004 analyzing DNA microsatellites suggested that ""Culex molestus"" is likely a distinct species from ""Culex pipiens"". However, a more recent paper from 2012 argues that it is more accurately 'a physiological and ecological variant of ""Cx. pipiens"" ' and should not be considered a distinct species."
"This mosquito, although first discovered in Egypt in the late 18th century, has been found in underground systems around the world. Some authors suggested that it adapted to human-made underground systems since the last century from local above-ground ""Culex pipiens"", but the more recent evidence suggests it is a southern mosquito variety related to ""C. pipiens"" that has adapted to the warm underground spaces of northern cities."
"Behavioral evidence for this mosquito being a different species from ""C. pipiens"" comes from research by Kate Byrne and Richard Nichols. The species have very different behaviours, are extremely difficult to mate, and with different allele frequencies consistent with genetic drift during a founder event. More specifically, this mosquito, ""C. molestus"", breeds all-year round, is cold intolerant, and bites rats, mice, and humans, in contrast to the above-ground species, which is cold tolerant, hibernates in the winter, and is considered to mostly feed on bird hosts. When the two varieties were crossbred, the eggs were infertile, suggesting reproductive isolation."

"Pousa, son of Sólyom (; died 31 March 1241) was a Hungarian nobleman, who served as voivode of Transylvania twice, in 1227 and 1235 to 1241."
"Pousa served as ispán (""comes"") of Vas County in 1225. During the reign of Andrew II, he was a faithful supporter of crown prince Béla, who held the title of Duke of Transylvania after 1226, following the agreement between the king and his son after a series of conflicts for the throne. Sometime Duke Béla acted independently of his father, as it is demonstrated by his grant of tax exemption to Transylvanian knights in 1231 and by his donation of lands situated in Wallachia in 1233. Pousa served as master of the treasury (""camerarius"") for Béla in 1225."
"He was appointed voivode of Transylvania in 1227. According to László Markó, he held the office between 1226 and 1229, however existing charters only prove the term of voivodeship in 1227. He served as master of the horse for duke Béla between 1229 and 1233."
"When Béla ascended the throne in 1235, Pousa was appointed voivode of Transylvania for the second time. In 1241, Transylvania suffered during the Mongol invasion of Europe. Güyük Khan invaded the province from the Oituz Pass in March. Voivode Pousa fought them with his royal army near Burzenland (), where he fell in battle on 31 March 1241. The Mongols continued their campaign toward the interior of the Kingdom of Hungary."
= = = AVX-512 = = =
"AVX-512 are 512-bit extensions to the 256-bit Advanced Vector Extensions SIMD instructions for x86 instruction set architecture (ISA) proposed by Intel in July 2013, and implemented in Intel's Xeon Phi x200 (Knights Landing) and Skylake-X CPUs; this includes the Core-X series (excluding the Core i5-7640X and Core i7-7740X), as well as the new Xeon Scalable Processor Family and Xeon D-2100 Embedded Series."
"AVX-512 is not the first 512-bit SIMD instruction set that Intel has introduced in processors: the earlier 512-bit SIMD instructions used in the first generation Xeon Phi coprocessors, derived from Intel's Larrabee project, are similar but not binary compatible and only partially source compatible."
AVX-512 consists of multiple extensions that may be implemented independently. This policy is a departure from the historical requirement of implementing the entire instruction block. Only the core extension AVX-512F (AVX-512 Foundation) is required by all AVX-512 implementations.
"The AVX-512 instruction set consists of several separate sets each having their own unique CPUID feature bit; however, they are typically grouped by the processor generation that implements them."
"The VEX prefix used by AVX and AVX2, while flexible, did not leave enough room for the features Intel wanted to add to AVX-512. This has led them to define a new prefix called EVEX."
"Compared to VEX, EVEX adds the following benefits:"
"The extended registers, SIMD width bit, and opmask registers of AVX-512 are mandatory and all require support from the OS."
"The AVX-512 instructions are designed to mix with 128/256-bit AVX/AVX2 instructions without a performance penalty. However, AVX-512VL extensions allows the use of AVX-512 instructions on 128/256-bit registers XMM/YMM, so most SSE and AVX/AVX2 instructions have new AVX-512 versions encoded with the EVEX prefix which allow access to new features such as opmask and additional registers. Unlike AVX-256, the new instructions do not have new mnemonics but share namespace with AVX, making the distinction between VEX and EVEX encoded versions of an instruction ambiguous in the source code. Since AVX-512F only works on 32- and 64-bit values, SSE and AVX/AVX2 instructions that operate on bytes or words are available only with the AVX-512BW extension (Byte & Word support)."
"The width of the SIMD register file is increased from 256 bits to 512 bits, and expanded from 16 to a total of 32 registers ZMM0-ZMM31. These registers can be addressed as 256 bit YMM registers from AVX extensions and 128-bit XMM registers from Streaming SIMD Extensions, and legacy AVX and SSE instructions can be extended to operate on the 16 additional registers XMM16-XMM31 and YMM16-YMM31 when using EVEX encoded form."
"Most AVX-512 instructions may indicate one of 8 opmask registers (k0–k7). For instructions which use a mask register as an opmask, register `k0` is special: a hardcoded constant used to indicate unmasked operations. For other operations, such as those that write to an opmask register or perform arithmetic or logical operations, `k0` is a functioning, valid register. In most instructions, the opmask is used to control which values are written to the destination. A flag controls the opmask behavior, which can either be ""zero"", which zeros everything not selected by the mask, or ""merge"", which leaves everything not selected untouched. The merge behavior is identical to the blend instructions."
"The opmask registers are normally 16 bits wide, but can be up to 64 bits with the AVX-512BW extension. How many of the bits are actually used, though, depends on the vector type of the instructions masked. For the 32-bit single float or double words, 16 bits are used to mask the 16 elements in a 512-bit register. For double float and quad words, at most 8 mask bits are used."
"The opmask register is the reason why several bitwise instructions which naturally have no element widths had them added in AVX-512. For instance, bitwise AND, OR or 128-bit shuffle now exist in both double-word and quad-word variants with the only difference being in the final masking."
"The opmask registers have a new mini extension of instructions operating directly on them. Unlike the rest of the AVX-512 instructions, these instructions are all VEX encoded. The initial opmask instructions are all 16-bit (Word) versions. With AVX-512DQ 8-bit (Byte) versions were added to better match the needs of masking 8 64-bit values, and with AVX-512BW 32-bit (Double) and 64-bit (Quad) versions were added so they can mask up to 64 8-bit values. The instructions KORTEST and KTEST can be used to set the x86 flags based on mask registers, so that they may be used together with non-SIMD x86 branch and conditional instructions."
"Many AVX-512 instructions are simply EVEX versions of old SSE or AVX instructions. There are, however, several new instructions, and old instructions that have been replaced with new AVX-512 versions. The new or majorly reworked instructions are listed below. These ""foundation"" instructions also include the extensions from AVX-512VL and AVX-512BW since those extensions merely add new versions of these instructions instead of new instructions."
A possible new utilization for crambe are biofuels since the oil composition is suitable for processing.
"Genetically, ""C. abyssinica"" has a set of 2n=90 chromosomes and is hexaploid. However, it shows low genetic variation in important agronomic traits, e.g. erucic acid content. Thus, improvement of cultivars through selection is difficult to achieve. A new source of variation could be found in the related taxon ""Crambe hispanica"". Recent efforts are found in the field of gene technology. To overcome the limited genetic variation, gene technology has been used in recent years to improve different important agronomic traits of crambe. Site-directed mutagenesis could be another tool for further improvement of the crop. However, the genetic control of many agronomic traits are unknown, thus the potential for genetic improvement is limited at the moment. Additionally further research aims to assess the potential of using the seed cake in protein-based plastic production and to find further uses for the whole plant."

"231st Street is a local station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of West 231st Street and Broadway in the Kingsbridge and Riverdale sections of the Bronx, it is served by the 1 train at all times."
"This station opened on January 27, 1907 as the 230th Street station, but was built near the site of the originally proposed northern terminus of the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line at Bailey Avenue and 230th Street, a block southeast of the current station. It was also near two former Kingsbridge railroad stations owned by two separate branches inherited by the New York Central Railroad; one was along a former segment of the Spuyten Duyvil and Port Morris Railroad (now the Hudson Line), and the other was for the New York and Putnam Railroad (now abandoned)."
"In 1948, platforms on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line from 103rd Street to 238th Street were lengthened to 514 feet to allow full ten-car express trains to platform. Previously the stations could only platform six car local trains. The platform extensions were opened in stages. On July 9, 1948, the platform extensions at stations between 207th Street and 238th Street were opened for use at the cost of $423,000."
"In 2002, it was announced that 231st Street would be one of ten subway stations citywide, as well as one of five on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, to receive renovations. The station was extensively renovated in 2003–2004, which included installation of elevators for both platforms to make it fully ADA-accessible and replacing the exit-only turnstiles on the 242nd Street-bound platform with High Entry/Exit and Exit-Only turnstiles ones, allowing both access and exit from that side."
"This elevated station has two side platforms and three tracks. The center track that bypasses this station is not used in revenue service. This is the IRT Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line's southernmost station in the Bronx (Marble Hill–225th Street station is physically on the mainland of New York State, but legally part of Manhattan)."
"Both platforms have beige windscreens and red canopies with green frames and outlines in the center and green waist-high, steel fences at either ends with lampposts at regular intervals. The platforms are offset with the Manhattan-bound platform to the south of the 242nd Street-bound one. The station signs are in the standard black name plates in white lettering."
"There are two sets of artwork at this station. One of them was made in 1991 and is called ""Elevated Nature I-IV"" by Wopo Holup. It consists of gray marble tiles with a green border on the platform walls of the station house. It is also located at four other stations on this line. The other artwork was made in 2007 by Felipe Galindo and is called ""Magic Realism in Kingsbridge"". It consists of stained glass panels on the platform windscreens depicting images of the surrounding area."
"Each platform has an adjacent same-level station house in the center. However, only the Manhattan-bound platform is open to the public. A set of doors from the platform leads to a small waiting area and a bank of turnstiles. On the 242nd Street-bound platform, a set of High Entry/Exit and Exit-Only turnstiles lead to a passageway around the station house separated from the platform by a metal fence."
"Outside fare control on the Manhattan-bound platform, there is a token booth, two staircases going down to either western corners of 231st Street and Broadway, and one elevator going down to the southwest corner. Two emergency gates on the platform lead directly to each of the staircases. Outside fare control on the 242nd Street-bound platform, there are two staircases going down to either eastern corners of 231st Street and Broadway and one elevator going down to the northeast corner."

"Kevin Lamont Hardy (born July 24, 1973) is a former American football linebacker in the National Football League (NFL) for the Jacksonville Jaguars, Dallas Cowboys, and Cincinnati Bengals. He played college football at the University of Illinois."
"Hardy attended William Henry Harrison High School, where he received numerous awards and accolades as a high school football player. As a senior, he posted 127 tackles (47 solo), 2 interceptions, 32 receptions for 610 yards and 13 touchdowns, 55 carries for 410 yards, returned 6 punts for 42 yards and 15 kickoffs for 344 yards. He received All-Evansville, City Player of the Year, All-Southern Indiana and Conference and Region Player of the Year honors."
"He also was a cum laude honor roll student, played basketball and ran track. His basketball teammates included Calbert Cheaney, an All-American at Indiana, Walter McCarty, who played at Kentucky, and Chris Lowery who played at Southern Illinois and is now an assistant coach at Kansas State University."
"Hardy accepted a football scholarship from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. As a redshirt freshman, he was third on the team with 67 tackles. As a sophomore, he started all 11 games and ranked fourth on the team with 78 tackles."
"As a junior, he registered 80 tackles. During his time at Illinois, the Fighting Illini had a number of outstanding linebackers. In the 1994 season, the four linebackers in coach Lou Tepper's 3–4 defense were Hardy, fellow Butkus Award winner Dana Howard, future NFL player John Holecek, and Simeon Rice. Because of this, Hardy was often overlooked as a linebacker. At his position, he was not prolific in accumulating tackles like Howard, or in quarterback sacks as was Rice, who as a ""rush linebacker"" played on the line of scrimmage like a defensive end."
"Hardy was recognized as being among the very best linebackers in college football as a senior, winning the Dick Butkus Award and receiving consensus first-team All-American honors. He started every game at ""drop"" linebacker, finishing with 105 tackles (second on the team), 11 sacks, 15 tackles for loss, 5 forced fumbles and 3 interceptions (tied for the team lead). He had 18 tackles against Michigan State University and 3 sacks against Indiana University."
"Hardy finished his career ranked ninth on the Illinois All-time list with 330 tackles, fourth in sacks with 18, and fourth in tackles for loss with 38. He was a business major and was initiated as a member of Omega Psi Phi fraternity."
"Hardy was selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars with the second overall choice in the 1996 NFL Draft, signing a six-year $14.8 million contract with a six million dollar signing bonus. Hardy's fellow linebacker at Illinois, Rice, was selected with the third overall choice. Hardy became the first defensive rookie in franchise history to start on opening day, going on to start 15 games. He recorded 130 tackles (second on the team), 5.5 sacks (third in the NFL among rookies), 7 quarterback hurries, 2 interceptions (tied for the team lead), 7 passes defensed, 2 forced fumbles, one fumble recovery and was named to the NFL All-Rookie team."
"In 1997, he was limited with injuries, starting 11 out of 13 games at strongside linebacker. He tallied 73 tackles (3 for loss), 2.5 sacks and 5 quarterback hurries. He suffered a sprained left medial collateral ligament against the Dallas Cowboys, missing 3 contests and seeing limited action in several games the remainder of the season because of the injury. He was able to start the wild card playoff game against the Denver Broncos, collecting 8 tackles."
"In 1998, with the signing of free agent Bryce Paup, he was moved to weakside linebacker and started all 16 games. He had a franchise record 186 tackles, while also making 1.5 sacks, 10 quarterback hurries, 2 interceptions, 7 passes defensed, 2 forced fumbles and one fumble recovery."
"In 1999, Hardy led all AFC linebackers with 10.5 sacks and led the team with 153 tackles. He also had 7 tackles for loss, 24 quarterback hurries, 2 forced fumbles and one fumble recovery, helping the Jaguars achieve a 14-win season. Hardy was selected to the Pro Bowl as well as named to the AP All-Pro first team."
"In 2000, he registered 149 tackles (led the team), 3 sacks, 16 quarterback pressures, 6 tackles for loss, one interception, 5 passes defensed, 2 forced fumbles and 2 fumble recoveries."
"In 2001, he was moved back to strongside linebacker, but injured his knee in the ninth game of the season. At the time he had 98 tackles (second on the team), 5 1/2 sacks (tied for third on the team), 9 quarterback pressures, one interception and 4 passes defensed. It would be his last game with the Jaguars, who eventually moved him to the injured reserve list, due to needing a microfracture surgery which was thought to be career threatening, because in those days not many players fully recovered from this medical procedure. He left as the franchise's All-time tackles leader, after playing six seasons, which included four trips to the NFL playoffs."
"The Dallas Cowboys gambled that he could return from the complex surgery and signed him on April 14, 2002, as an unrestricted free agent, counting $2.5 million in his first year and structuring the rest of the $23 million contract with a $5.025 million option in the second year."
"Hardy recovered from his injury and played for the Cowboys in the 2002 NFL season, finishing the season ranked third on the team in both total (114) and solo tackles(73), while making 2 sacks, 18 quarterback pressures, 8 tackles for loss, 10 passes defensed and 3 forced fumbles. He played outside linebacker, lining up as a defensive end in some passing downs. Because of salary cap issues, he was released on February 27, 2003, in order to avoid a $5.025 million option bonus if the Cowboys retained him."
"On March 6, 2003, he signed a four-year, $14 million USD contract with the Cincinnati Bengals as an unrestricted free agent, to be the Bengals new middle linebacker, after playing outside linebacker in his previous seasons. Hardy was an integral part of the Bengals' defense, starting all 16 games, leading the team in defensive snaps played (1,030 of 1,038 for 99.2%) and was second on the team in tackles (91)."
"In 2004, he was moved to strongside linebacker after the signing of free agent Nate Webster, starting 14 games and making 84 tackles. The Bengals terminated Hardy's contract in a salary-cap move on May 3, 2005."
"Hardy finished his career with 742 tackles (563 solo), 36 sacks, 43.5 tackles for loss, 11 forced fumbles, seven fumble recoveries, 45 pass deflections, five interceptions for 59 yards, and one touchdown in 134 games."
"Hardy currently resides in Jacksonville, Florida. In August 2007, he built his South Beach club venture, Dream Nightclub, centered around a motto that ""reality is overrated."" ""I've been around and entertained people all my life, so I made a business out of it"" said Hardy."

By 2006 the show was moved to a more traditional Sunday night slot—alleviating problems with the taping schedule of ""SmackDown!"" (usually held on Tuesdays)—and renamed Cyber Sunday."
"The most distinctive feature of Cyber Sunday was the ability for fans to vote on certain aspects of every match.

Kevin Thomas of the ""Los Angeles Times"" wrote, ""Those who saw 'Count Yorga' will be disappointed. Those who only see 'The Return' will wonder what all the fuss was about in regard to the original. In the first film comedy gave way to terror; in this self-conscious sequel the two elements tend to cancel each other out. The result is a pretty silly show."" David Pirie of ""The Monthly Film Bulletin"" wrote that Count Yorga had been resurrected ""with considerably more enterprise and panache than before."" He praised the acting as being ""of a generally high standard"" and the castle set as ""skilfully utilised to give the impression of a labyrinth of Borgesian proportions,"" though he criticized ""a totally unnecessary and feeble attempt to make the Count into a sympathetic figure through such lines as, 'The most fragile emotion ever known has entered my breast.'"""
= = = Nuoli-class fast gunboat = = =
"The Nuoli class motor gunboats () was a series of thirteen fast attack craft (gun) of the Finnish Navy. The ships were constructed in 1961 by Oy Laivateollisuus Ab in Turku, and modernized in 1979. The Nuoli motor gunboats played a very important role in naval training and were in service to early 90s."
"There are two distinctive versions, 1-10 and 11-13. The former could be distinguished by having a higher superstructure. All were equipped with three Soviet-made V-12 diesel engines. There was no separate cruise engine, except from a small auxiliary engine that produced electricity. The vessels were first equipped with large screws, but later changed to smaller, albeit equally effective screws, manufactured by Finnscrew."
"The Nuoli-class was planned to be armed with electrically controlled Bofors 40/70-system, but limitations of the auxiliary engine prevented this. For a brief time, Madsen 20/60 were replaced with Breda 12.7 mm heavy machine-gun which came from WW II-period Fiat G50-fighters; the change back to Madsen was done in 1981."
"Finland was forbidden to have torpedo boats after World War II, but the Nuoli class could quickly be converted into such, if need arose. in 1982 Nuoli-6 was transferred and ferried to Obbnäs torpedo test station to be used as test vessel for a new Finnish-origin torpedo system, which failed. The trip to Obbnäs was made in heavy weather - the waves were so hard that they damaged the wooden support structure of the bow. Nuoli-6 was driven aground in Obbnäs 1983 (summer/autumn) and was stricken."
"As service vessel these boats gave one a true feeling of being a sailor. Constructed of wood, they leaked ""a bit"" an so the atmosphere was rather moist. Living quarters were limited - even those of the commanding officer. There was no privacy at all - on Nuoli one was true member of the crew."
"The vessels are today spread all over Finland, and one is in Germany (Nuoli 12). Nuoli 8 is preserved at the Turku marine museum ""Forum Marinum""."
= = = 1991 Football League Cup Final = = =
The 1991 Football League Cup Final was a football match played on 21 April 1991 between Manchester United and Sheffield Wednesday. It was the first of two years that the competition was sponsored by Rumbelows.
"Despite the previous season's FA Cup winners, Manchester United, being favourites to lift the trophy, Second Division side Sheffield Wednesday won the match 1–0, the winning goal scored by John Sheridan, giving the Owls their first League Cup title in a season when they also won promotion back to the top flight. The match is regarded as one of the most memorable League Cup finals of all time."
The trophy was presented to Wednesday skipper Nigel Pearson by Rumbelows employee of the year Tracy Bateman. Pearson was also named man of the match.
"The Football League Cup is a cup competition open to clubs in the Premier League and The Football League. It is played on a knockout basis, with the exception of the semi-finals, which are contested over a two-legged tie. As clubs in the top two divisions of The Football League, both teams entered the competition in the second round."
"Manchester United's second-round tie saw them drawn against Fourth Division Halifax Town; they won the first leg at The Shay 3–1, with goals from Clayton Blackmore, Brian McClair and Neil Webb, before Viv Anderson and Steve Bruce gave them a 2–1 win at Old Trafford and a 5–2 aggregate victory. Anderson, who was by now rarely used in the United first team, went on to be sold to Sheffield Wednesday three months later, his appearance for United in the early stages of the competition making him ineligible for Wednesday's matches and denying him the chance to add to the two League Cup medals he had won with Nottingham Forest and a later medal in the competition won with Arsenal."
"They were then drawn against rivals and reigning First Division champions Liverpool in the third round, where Mark Hughes and Lee Sharpe joined Bruce on the score sheet in a 3–1 home win. In the fourth round, a 19-year-old Sharpe scored a hat-trick in addition to goals from Blackmore, Hughes and Danny Wallace to give United a 6–2 away win over Arsenal, who would go on to win the First Division title that season, just over a month after the two teams had been involved in a mass brawl during a 1–0 Arsenal win at Old Trafford that saw both teams deducted points."
"In the fifth round, United were held to a 1–1 draw away to Southampton, Hughes scoring their only goal; Hughes was again the only United player on the score sheet in the replay a week later, scoring a hat-trick in a 3–2 win that put them into the semi-finals. Southampton striker Alan Shearer, who within months was reported to be transfer target for Manchester United, scoring all of Southampton's goals during the two cup clashes with United."
"Goals from McClair and Sharpe gave United a 2–1 win in the first leg of the semi-final at home to Leeds United, and Sharpe scored again in the second leg – his sixth League Cup goal of the season – as United won 1–0, and 3–1 on aggregate, to put them into their second League Cup final."
"Sheffield Wednesday, whose last major honour had been the FA Cup in 1935, were fresh from relegation to the Second Division when they were drawn against Third Division Brentford in the second round, winning 2–1 in each of the two legs to put them into the third round. There they met fellow Second Division side Swindon Town, who held them to a goalless draw at Hillsborough, before succumbing to a 1–0 defeat at the County Ground in the replay a week later. Wednesday required another replay in the fourth round, after they played out another draw at home to Derby County, but beat them 2–1 at the Baseball Ground two weeks later."
"The quarter-final saw Wednesday drawn away to Coventry City, where a 1-0 victory for Wednesday ended any hopes that Coventry's new player-manager Terry Butcher might have had of beginning his managerial career with silverware. Their semi-final opponents were drawn against Chelsea. The first leg of the semi-final was played at Stamford Bridge, where goals from Peter Shirtliff and David Hirst gave them a 2–0 win, before Nigel Pearson, Danny Wilson and Paul Williams gave them a 3–1 win in the second leg at Hillsborough to put them into the final, 5–1 on aggregate. It was Wednesday's first Wembley cup final in 25 years."
"The broadcast of this League Cup final caused controversy in Yorkshire, where instead of showing the post-match celebrations (as London Weekend Television did), Yorkshire Television decided to cut the broadcast short to show a programme titled ""War of the Monster Trucks"". People from Sheffield often cite this event as a demonstration of the station's bias towards West Yorkshire, Leeds and above all Leeds United. The incident inspired the name of the Sheffield Wednesday fanzine ""War of the Monster Trucks""."

Bibi Amtus Salam (died 29 September 1985) was a social worker and disciple of Mohandas Gandhi who played an active role in combating communal violence in the wake of the Partition of India and in the rehabilitation of refugees who came to India following partition.
"Bibi Amtus Salam was born the daughter of Abdul Majid Khan and belonged to a conservative but aristocratic Muslim family of Patiala. She was denied an education owing to the family's observance of ""purdah"" which she shunned in 1925."
"Bibi Amtus Salam was a close associate of Gandhi's and he saw and addressed her as his daughter. Writing to Sardar Patel in 1934, Gandhi noted that the frail Salam's ""heart is gold, but her body is brass"". Salam was an advocate of Hindu-Muslim amity and channeled her efforts to attaining that goal."
"In 1947, as riots occurred throughout India, Gandhi toured Bengal to try and calm tempers. Amtus Salam accompanied him on that trip and fasted with him for 21 days at Noakhali to bring peace there. Gandhi left her there to continue with the efforts of re-establishing communal harmony in Noakhali and later observed that ""you are the moving spirit behind whatever peace has been achieved in Noakhali. It was and still is your most significant work. Only you can sustain it. Wherever you stand, you stand in the capacity of my daughter, do you not?"""
"Amtus Salam had wanted to stay in Patiala during the Partition and its accompanying violence, as a young and single Muslim woman, to further the cause of communal harmony. She opted to stay on India even as her brothers and most of her extended family chose to move to Pakistan and their action both dismayed and angered her. Gandhi arranged for their safe passage to West Pakistan."
"In his ""India Wins Freedom"", Maulana Azad notes that Mohammed Ali Jinnah's title of Quaid-e-Azam (Great Leader) was first popularised by Gandhi who had followed Amtus Salam's suggestion that he address Jinnah thus since the Urdu press referred to him by that title. Azad writes that in following Salam's advice without considering the consequences of his letter, which was published in the newspapers, Gandhi ended up legitimizing Jinnah's image as the Quaid before Indian Muslims."
"Amtus Salam was one of the women to take part in his controversial celibacy tests.. She used to sleep and bathe with him naked with another disciple, Sushila Nayyar also serving him."
"During 1947-48, she worked on the evacuation and rehabilitation of thousands of women kidnapped during the melee that followed Partition. Here she was assisted by Lajjawati Hooja, a member of the Congress and the All-India Women's Congress and Salam made several trips to Pakistan to help with the evacuation of refugees."
"She established the Kasturba Seva Mandir and settled down in Rajpura where she worked on the resettlement of Hindu migrants from Bahawalpur. When the Government of India began constructing a township at Rajpura for the rehabilitation of refugees, she was involved in the work there along with the Hindustani Talimi Sangh who worked on the education of the children in the refugee camps."
"In the 1980s, Amtus Salam served as a permanent invitee on the All India Committee on Jail Reforms. She died in September 1985."

"Almost Home is the major label debut extended play (EP) by American hip hop recording artist Kid Ink; it was released on May 28, 2013, by Tha Alumni Music Group, 88 Classic, RCA Records in the United States. The album was produced by various producers, such as Lifted, Rico Love and Ned Cameron along with guest appearances by Meek Mill, Wale, French Montana, and ASAP Ferg. Upon its release, the EP debuted at number 27 on the US ""Billboard"" 200."
"On January 4, 2013, Kid Ink has announced he had signed a deal with RCA Records and premiered the lead single for his debut project titled ""Bad Ass"" featuring Wale and Meek Mill. ""Bad Ass"" was meant to be a single to tide fans over for his first full-length. RCA associate director of marketing Shani Fuller said, ""We wanted to continue along the theme of being an indie and releasing music all the time,"" ""We just really wanted to feed his fans with new music and a new look as we approached his album later in the year."" Six tracks were selected from more than 140 possible cuts for the disc and a few songs were streamed ahead of release, including ""Sunset,"" a track that Kid Ink says ""really motivated the EP. The EP features additional guest appearances from ASAP Ferg, and French Montana on a remix of his mixtape track ""Bossin' Up"". On the following day, after the EPs release he released a freestyle which was set to be the EPs first track."
"The EPs lead single ""Bad Ass"" was released for digital download on January 22, 2013. The song was released to Rhythm Crossover radio in the United States on February 26, 2013. It has since peaked at number 90 on the ""Billboard"" Hot 100 and number 27 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart."
"The EPs second single ""Money and the Power"" produced by N4, Ned Cameron and Jonathan Lauture, was released on May 28, 2013. It was released to radio on July 19, 2013. The song peaked at number 70 on the German Top 100 songs chart and 52 on the ""Billboard"" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Money and the Power is one of the official theme songs of WrestleMania 31."
"""Almost Home"" debuted at number 27 on the US ""Billboard"" 200 in its first week of release and sold 20,000 copies in the United States."
"Upon its release, ""Almost Home"" was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. Rick Florino of Artistdirect said ""Ink's got an undeniable ability to infuse that sharp sensibility into even catchier fare like the R&B-tinged goodbye ""Was It Worth It"" featuring Sterling Simms, while elsewhere ""Sunset"" coasts from video game-esque keyboards into a cinematic narrative cruising Cali with no cares."" DJBooth.net said ""Kid Ink knows what he does well and has it down to a fine science; he demonstrate his ability to put together a high-energy song and his hooks are top notch, while not without its flaws, the ""Almost Home"" EP is a good jumping off point for the emcee. I see a lot of talent, but there is room for growth."""
"Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush praised it saying, ""The collection boasts six anthemic tunes that should get you charged for the summer months ahead. Standouts include the bombastic song ""Money and the Power"", the inspiring track ""Sunset"" and the laid-back remix of ""Bad Ass""."" ""The Source"" said of the EP ""What makes this it appealing though is the balance Kid Ink found in allowing listeners into the carefree, TMZ lifestyle he’s caught up in due to his fame and also capturing themes the average person can relate to-grinding everyday to achieve goals."" NMB of ""XXL"" said, ""Throughout the EP, Ink shows confidence in his rhymes and a strong command of his hooks, slinging catchy boasts alongside A$AP Ferg and French Montana on “Bossin’ Up”. Walking the line between singing and rapping on songs like “Fuck Sleep” and “Sunset” Ink’s sound has a distinctly laid-back California feel on the whole."""
= = = Thomas Woodbine Hinchliff = = =
"Thomas Woodbine Hinchliff (5 December 1825 – 8 May 1882) was an English mountaineer, traveller, and author, from 1875 to 1877 the seventh President of the Alpine Club."
"After qualifying as a barrister, Hinchliff abandoned the law and took to a life of travelling and writing. His books include ""Summer Months among the Alps"" (1857), ""South American Sketches"" (1863), and ""Over the Sea and Far Away"" (1876)."
"Born at Southwark, Hinchliffe was the son of Chamberlain Hinchliff (1780–1856), of Croom's Hill, Greenwich, and Lee, both then in Kent, by his marriage in 1824 to Sarah Parish, a daughter of Woodbine Parish of Bawburgh in Norfolk, the sister of Sir Woodbine Parish (1796–1882), a traveller and diplomat. Hinchliff was educated at the West Ham Grammar School, the Blackheath Proprietary School, and Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1849, when he became a member of Lincoln's Inn. Three years later he proceeded MA at Cambridge and was called to the bar, but did not pursue a career as a barrister."
"In 1856, his father died."
"Hinchliff was a minor figure of the golden age of alpinism, between Wills's ascent of the Wetterhorn in 1854 and Whymper's conquest of the Matterhorn in 1865. In 1857 he was a founding member of the Alpine Club, the club meeting in his Lincoln's Inn chambers before it leased rooms of its own at 8 St Martin's Place, Trafalgar Square in 1859. John Ball was elected the club's first President, with E. S. Kennedy as Vice-President and Hinchliff as Secretary. In 1857 Hinchliffe published ""Summer Months Among the Alps: With the Ascent of Monte Rosa"", a work which some twenty years later Mark Twain referred to as ""Hinchliffe's book"". In his ""A Tramp Abroad"" (1880), Twain's narrator advises his friend Harris to read this book to learn about mountain climbing, and a description in it of a fall influences the course of Twain's story."
With Leslie Stephen and the guide Melchior Anderegg Hinchliff made an early ascent of the Wildstrubel on 11 September 1858 and the first ascent of the Alphubel on 9 August 1860.
"In 1861, Hinchliff visited South America, staying with his cousin Frank Parish, the British Consul in Buenos Aires. He spent some months on extensive travels in Brazil and Argentina, with expeditions into the Serra dos Órgãos, Teresópolis, Petrópolis, and Juiz de Fora, and these were recounted in his ""South American Sketches"" of 1863. In 1873 he set off to travel around the world with a friend named William Henry Rawson, and in two years they crossed some 35,000 miles of ocean, while spending a further six months on land. Shortly after his return to England in 1875, Hinchliff was elected President of the Alpine Club, and in 1876 he published ""Over the Sea and Far Away"", an account of his journey around the world. Describing his sad thoughts on the view of Tupungato and Aconcagua from Santiago, Hinchliff reflected that"
"Hinchliff died suddenly at Aix-les-Bains, France, on 8 May 1882. A monument to him stands on the north-west side of the Riffelalp resort in Switzerland. His obituary in the ""Alpine Journal"" said he had had ""a kind of genius for friendship"", while the ""Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society"" noted that ""the Society loses a member who, if not an explorer, was an indefatigable traveller"". In 1910 a climbing anthology called him ""one of the first to penetrate the higher solitudes of the world of ice and snow""."
"Through the 1980s and 1990s, ""FSV"" was as an upper table side in third division play and earned a single season promotion to the 2nd Bundesliga in the 1986–87 following their qualification round win over ""SSV Ulm 1846"". In 1990, they beat ""Rheydter SV"" 2:0 to claim the national amateur championship. The team again qualified for promotion play following their 1992 Oberliga title, but were beaten by ""Wuppertaler SV"". Between 1992–96, ""Salmrohr"" captured five consecutive regional cup titles, however, in the late-1990s the club's performances began to tail off and they slipped to lower level competition."
"An attempt to give ""Eintracht Trier"" a boost into the 2.Bundesliga in 1997 through a partial union that saw a number of ""Salmrohr""'s footballers go to ""Trier"" failed. The next year the club only escaped relegation because a pair of teams that finished ahead of them were denied licenses due to their financial problems. By the turn of the millennium ""Salmrohr"" was playing in the Oberliga Südwest as a fourth division side."
"Most recently the team drifted between the Oberliga Südwest and the Rheinlandliga, winning another promotion in 2011 and finishing sixth in the Oberliga in 2012. From 2012–13 the Oberliga Südwest was renamed Oberliga Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar, with ""Salmrohr"" continuing in this league. It came second in the league in 2013 and 2014 and narrowly missed out on promotion when it lost to FC Nöttingen in the newly introduced promotion round of the Oberliga runners-up."

= = = Defense Language Aptitude Battery = = =
"The Defense Language Aptitude Battery (DLAB) is a test used by the United States Department of Defense to test an individual's potential for learning a foreign language and thus determining who may pursue training as a military linguist. It consists of 126 multiple-choice questions and the test is scored out of a possible 164 points. The test is composed of five audio sections and one visual section. As of 2009, the test is completely web-based. The test does not attempt to gauge a person's fluency in a given language, but rather to determine their ability to learn a language. The test will give the service member examples of what a selection of words or what a portion of a word means, then asks the test taker to create a specific word from the samples given."
"Preparation for the DLAB includes multiple study guides and practice tests. These resources give one the appropriate means by which to prepare for the test and gauge a possible outcome. However, a study guide for the DLAB is not like traditional studying - you are not learning content that will be on the DLAB, but rather learning the style of the DLAB. Someone failing the test or getting a low score can always retake the DLAB but only after a wait of 6 months. For most service members, this is too long and will cause them to miss the deadline for submitting their scores. Adequate preparation is thus a near-necessity."
The languages are broken into tiers based on their difficulty level for a native English speaker as determined by the Defense Language Institute. The category into which a language is placed also determines the length of its basic course as taught at DLI.
"To qualify to pursue training in a language, one needs a minimum score of 95. The Marines will waive it to 90 for Cat I and Cat II languages and the Navy will waive it to an 85 for Cat I languages, a 90 for Cat II languages, and a 95 for Cat III languages. The Air Force does not currently offer a waiver. The Army National Guard is able to waive a score of 90 into a Cat. IV language."
"The DLAB is typically administered to new and prospective recruits at the United States Military Entrance Processing Command sometime after the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery is taken but before a final job category (NEC, MOS, AFSC) is determined. An individual may usually take the DLAB if they score high enough on the ASVAB for linguist training and are interested in doing so. The DLAB is also administered to ROTC cadets while they are still attending college. The DLAB is also used for the Australian Defence Force."
"Furthermore, the DLAB is a required test for officers looking to either join the Foreign Area Officer program or the Olmsted Scholar Program. The required grade for these programs is a 105, but the recommended grade is at least a 130 or above."
"Military personnel interested in retraining into a linguist field typically also must pass the DLAB. In few select cases, the DLAB requirement may be waived if proficiency in a foreign language is already demonstrated via the DLPT."
"While these scores are required to enter a language program of that category, often placement is based upon need rather than score. For example, a service member that receives a score of 115 may be placed in Russian (category III). The maximum score on the DLAB was 176, but has recently been lowered to 164."

"Aribert (or Heribert) (Italian: ""Ariberto da Intimiano"", Lombard: ""Aribert de Intimian"") (Intimiano, between 970 and 980 - Milan, 16 January 1045) was the archbishop of Milan from 1018, a quarrelsome warrior-bishop in an age in which such figures were not uncommon."
"Aribert went to Konstanz in June 1025, with other bishops of Northern Italy, to pay homage to Conrad II of Germany, the beleaguered founder of the Salian dynasty. There, in exchange for privileges, he agreed to crown Conrad with the Iron Crown of Lombardy, which the magnates had offered to Odo of Blois."
"This he did, on 26 March 1026, at Milan, for the traditional seat of Lombard coronations, Pavia, was still in revolt against imperial authority. He journeyed to Rome a year later for the imperial coronation of Conrad by Pope John XIX on 26 March 1027; at a synod at the Lateran he negotiated a decision of the precedence of the archdiocese of Milan over that of Ravenna. He subsequently joined an imperial military expedition into the Kingdom of Arles, which Conrad inherited upon the death in 1032 of Rudolph III of Burgundy, but which was contested by Odo."
"In the political arena of Italy, power was disputed between the great territorial magnates— the ""capitanei""— with their vassal captains and the lesser nobility— the ""valvassores""— allied with the burghers of the Italian communes."
"Aribert created enemies among the lower nobility, against whom he perpetrated the worst violences, and with the metropolitan of Ravenna, whose episcopal rights, along with those of the smaller sees, he ignored. A revolt soon engulfed northern Italy and, at Aribert's request, Conrad's son, the Emperor Henry III, travelled south of the Alps in the winter of 1036/37, to quell it. The Emperor, however, took the position of champion of the ""valvassores"" and demanded that Aribert should make a defence against charges brought against him, but Aribert refused, on the grounds that he was the emperor's equal."

"My Fellow Americans is a 1996 American comedy film starring Jack Lemmon and James Garner as feuding ex-presidents. Dan Aykroyd, Lauren Bacall, Esther Rolle, John Heard, Wilford Brimley, Bradley Whitford and Jeff Yagher are also in the cast. It is named for the traditional opening of Presidential addresses to the American people."
"Lemmon's perennial collaborator, Walter Matthau, was slated to costar. Health problems kept him from appearing so Garner was chosen to star opposite Lemmon for their first project together."
"Republican Senator Russell Kramer of Ohio (Jack Lemmon) wins the Presidential election, narrowly defeating archrival Democratic Governor Matt Douglas of Indiana (James Garner). Four years later, Douglas wins a landslide victory over the now-incumbent Kramer. Another four years later, Kramer's former Vice President, William Haney (Dan Aykroyd), defeats Douglas. His Vice President, Ted Matthews (John Heard), is widely seen as an idiot, and becomes a continuing embarrassment for the administration. A further three years later, Kramer is spending his time writing books and speaking at various inconsequential functions, while Douglas is finishing his own book and going through a divorce."
"Meanwhile, the Democratic Party learns about ""Olympia"", codename for a series of bribes from defense contractor Charlie Reynolds (James Rebhorn) paid to Haney when he was Vice President. The Democratic National Committee chairman Joe Hollis (Wilford Brimley) asks Douglas to investigate. Hollis offers the support of the Democratic Party for a Presidential run in return for his help. Douglas accepts, hoping to beat Haney and get back into the Oval Office. Meanwhile, Haney and his Chief of Staff Carl Witnaur (Bradley Whitford) plot to frame Kramer for the scandal. When rumors begin to suggest that Kramer was involved in Olympia, he begins his own investigation."
"NSA agent Colonel Paul Tanner (Everett McGill) has Reynolds assassinated when he attempts to tell Douglas the truth about Olympia. Kramer arrives at the scene to find Douglas with Reynolds' body. Before they can flee, Douglas and Kramer are forced to board Marine One by White House officials, claiming to be taking them to Camp David at the request of Haney. During the flight Douglas realizes that they are heading in the wrong direction. Suspicious, they force the pilots to land. They disembark just before the helicopter explodes."
"Kramer and Douglas are left stranded, with the realization that the explosion was meant to kill them. They decide to go to Kramer's Presidential Library in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio to obtain records the overly-frugal Kramer kept of all meals served during his time in the White House, which will prove Haney was present at a key meeting with Reynolds. During a series of misadventures, they meet a variety of ordinary Americans and see the effects their terms in office have had. After several close encounters with NSA agents, they arrive at the library and discover the evidence has been tampered with to implicate Kramer. A guard gives Kramer a message from Reynolds' secretary stating that Witnaur had recently met with Reynolds. Douglas and Kramer kidnap Witnaur and with Joe Hollis's help, force him to reveal the plot to frame Kramer, though Witnaur claims to have no knowledge of the attempts on their lives, blaming Tanner and Haney. They at first decide to report Witnaur's confession to Kay Griffin (Sela Ward), a Fox News journalist, but Douglas, based upon their adventures, convinces Kramer go to the White House to confront Haney, seeing it as a chance of redemption for their poor choices as Presidents."
"They manage to sneak into the White House with the help of the White House Executive Chef Rita (Esther Rolle) and make it to the Executive Residence only to discover that Haney is giving a press conference outside. Tanner traps Douglas and Kramer in a guest room but they utilize a secret tunnel to escape while the NSA gives chase. Tanner catches up with them and is about to shoot them when he himself is killed by Secret Service Sniper Lieutenant Ralph Fleming (Jeff Yagher), who has recognized the presidents from a chance encounter at a gay pride parade during their adventure, and disobeys orders to shoot them."
"Douglas and Kramer interrupt Haney's speech and take him to the Oval Office to talk. There they play Haney a tape of Witnaur's confession, but Haney denies knowledge of Reynolds' murder or the helicopter explosion. Haney agrees to resign and proceeds to give a resignation speech, claiming to have heart problems. Douglas and Kramer muse that the idiotic Matthews will now be elevated from Vice President to President and realize that the only way it could have happened was under these circumstances. The pair confront Matthews who admits that he, not Haney, had engineered the entire plot so that he could become President, knowing Haney would take the fall. Matthews explains that his stupidity was just an act, but Douglas secretly records his confession on tape. Matthews is sent to prison."
"Nine months later, Douglas and Kramer are running together as independents in the Presidential election, arguing which of them will be the nominee for president. Douglas distracts Kramer by throwing a dollar on the floor, and takes to the podium to announce himself as the Presidential candidate, much to the chagrin of Kramer."
"Most of the principal filming for the film was done in the mountains of western North Carolina. Scenes were filmed along the Broad River where it flows into Lake Lure in Rutherford County, Dillsboro, along the Great Smoky Mountains Railroad; Waynesville, where a giant clown sign crashes through their windshield as they try to flee and where they find the baby in the stolen car is in Marshall, North Carolina; and in Asheville, at the Biltmore Estate."
"In Asheville, North Carolina, the downtown area stands in for an unnamed town in West Virginia. There, the Western Carolina University Marching Band portrays the ""All Dorothy Marching Band"" (a fictional group based upon gay icon Judy Garland's character in ""The Wizard of Oz""), at a gay pride parade."
"In his memoirs, Garner wrote that he enjoyed working with Lemmon but felt the director ""was a self appointed genius who didn't know his ass from second case and Jack and I both knew it."""
The film received mixed reviews from critics. It holds a 48% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 60 reviews and with an average rating of 5.3/10.
"Roger Ebert of the ""Chicago Sun-Times"" praised the performances of Lemmon and Garner but felt the movie was ""a series of cheap shots and missed opportunities"". However, he said that ""a lot of the cheap shots are funny, and maybe the climate is wrong for sharply barbed political satire. I dunno. This is not a great comedy and will be soon forgotten, but it has nice moments."" James Berardinelli of ""ReelViews"" also complimented the actors, writing ""Lemmon and Garner slip comfortably into their roles"" and saying the movie has ""some good one-liners"", but he criticized the ""failed attempts to inject embarrassingly trite melodrama and recycled action sequences into the story"" and also felt the political satire was ""weak and obligatory"". Mick LaSalle of the ""San Francisco Chronicle"" described ""My Fellow Americans"" as a ""pleasing but mediocre film, with a great cast, a great story and a misguided script."""
= = = The Firm (1993 film) = = =
"The Firm is a 1993 American legal thriller film directed by Sydney Pollack and starring Tom Cruise, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Gene Hackman, Ed Harris, Holly Hunter, Hal Holbrook and David Strathairn."
"The film is based on the 1991 novel ""The Firm"" by author John Grisham. ""The Firm"" was one of two films released in 1993 that were adapted from a Grisham novel, the other being ""The Pelican Brief""."
"In 1958, Anna Jurin accepts a job as a housekeeper of Saint Ange, a rusty and isolated orphanage located in the French Alps and owned by Madam Francard. The last batch of children have been sent elsewhere shortly after the mysterious death of a boy in the bathroom, which tarnishes the orphanage's reputation and threatens its closure. Other than Anna, the orphanage is now populated by only two people: the long-time cook Helenka and an adult orphan, Judith, who suffers from a mental disability and claims that there are other, unseen, children in the location."
"Throughout her stay, Anna experiences apparent supernatural phenomena. However, Helenka dismisses her worries as mere hallucinations, especially after she learns that Anna is pregnant due to a gang rape, a fact that she tries to hide at first. Anna learns that Judith is one of the many sent to Saint Ange in 1946 as a war orphan of World War II; because of shortages of supplies and logistics, Judith is the only survivor."
"Despite this explanation, Anna suspects that the orphanage deliberately killed and hid the children. She gains the trust of Judith by befriending and calming her when her kittens are apparently drowned by Helenka, enough for her to disclose that the children inhabit an area somewhere behind a mirror in bathroom, revealed to be an abandoned dormitory. Helenka tries to prevent them from heading to the area, but Judith knocks her unconscious. The two women proceed to the dormitory and find remains of toys and rotten food. Judith realizes that the children had really died and begs Anna to stop searching, but the latter insists on continuing and boards an elevator heading to the underground. Anna arrives at a sterile, hospital-like structure with clean white walls and brightly lit lamps. She is confronted by the children who rise from a series of murky baths, who surround her. Anna goes into a sudden labor and is helped to deliver the baby by the children."
"Sometime later, Francard and her assistant search for Anna in the underground, which is now damp, dark, and rust-walled. They find Anna and her baby on the floor, both dead. Deciding to leave them there, the two head upstairs to leave the premises alongside Helenka and Judith; it is implied that Anna has been hallucinating the phenomena due to the stress, as she is revealed to be the true culprit for the drowning of the kittens. However, before they leave, Judith throws away her medication, as Anna advised her earlier, and peeks into Anna's former bedroom, where she sees her and her baby, now as spirits of Saint Ange, alongside the dead children. Francard comes back for Judith and the film ends as the room is seen empty."
"According to Christophe Gans, the film was shot both in French and English. The Canadian DVD has both cuts of the film."
= = = Chintila = = =
"Chintila (; 606 – 20 December 639) was a Visigothic King of Hispania, Septimania and Galicia from 636. He succeeded Sisenand in a time of weakness and reigned until his death."
"He was elected and confirmed by a convention of bishops and nobles in accordance with the 75th canon of the Fourth Council of Toledo. With his election, nothing changed and instability reigned. He never solved the many problems that plagued his time in office and, as the chroniclers of the age report, this included rebellions in Septimania and Gallaecia. In the three years of his reign, he permitted the bishops wide authority and they acted as monarchs ""de facto"", if not ""de jure""."
"He dedicated his time to councils, the Fifth Council of Toledo in June 636 and the Sixth Council of Toledo in June 638. These meetings covered many topics and legislated many new regulations."
"The king had to be chosen from among the nobility; never a ""tonsurado"" (cleric), member of the servile classes (peasants), or foreigners. They dictated the penalties for insurrection and determined that property acquired justly by the king could not be confiscated by his successor. Finally, they outlawed non-Catholics within the frontiers of the kingdom, which resulted in many forced conversions."
Chintila died in 639 or 640 of natural causes and was followed by his son Tulga.
= = = List of Stargate Atlantis episodes = = =
"""Stargate Atlantis"" is a Canadian-American science fiction television series created by Brad Wright and Robert C. Cooper as a spin off from its sister show, ""Stargate SG-1"". The series resumes the story of the ""Lost City"" and ""New Order"" episodes of ""SG-1"", where a military team led by Colonel (now Brigadier General) Jack O'Neill, Dr. Daniel Jackson, Major (now Lt. Colonel) Samantha Carter and the Jaffa Teal'c, use an ancient alien artifact called the Stargate to travel to different planets to explore and find new technology. The series pilot ""Rising"" takes place in the year 2004 after the events of ""Lost City"" and ""New Order"", when they finally find the lost city of the Ancients."
"""Stargate Atlantis"" premiered on July 16, 2004 on the channel Sci Fi Channel. The Sci Fi Channel would air all the five seasons made for the series. Since the American broadcast splits each season to allow the production to catch up, the British and Canadian channels Sky One and The Movie Network aired the second part of some seasons before their American counterpart. ""Stargate Atlantis""<nowiki>'</nowiki> finale episode premiered in the United States on the Sci Fi Channel on January 9, 2009. The series finale was also the series' 100th episode. All five seasons of ""Stargate Atlantis"" are available on DVD. A direct-to-DVD film tentatively titled ""Stargate: Extinction"" was planned, but was later shelved."
"The cast of the first season consisted of Joe Flanigan starring as Maj. John Sheppard, David Hewlett as Dr. Rodney McKay, Rachel Luttrell as Teyla Emmagan, Torri Higginson as Elizabeth Weir and Rainbow Sun Francks as First Lt. Aiden Ford. Aiden Ford was reduced to recurring character in season two and was replaced by Jason Momoa as the extraterrestrial human Ronon Dex in episode three of season two. Francks continued to have a recurring role in season 2, until his character's death (although this was not confirmed). After Torri Higginson's departure as a main character from ""Stargate Atlantis"" after Season 3, she was replaced by Amanda Tapping's Carter from the sister show. Paul McGillion, Robert Picardo and Jewel Staite were also main characters. McGillion became a main character in season two until season three as Carson Beckett, Picardo replaced Tapping as a main character as the new leader of the Atlantis expedition as Richard Woolsey for season five, and Staite portrayed Jennifer Keller as a main character in season five."
<onlyinclude></onlyinclude>
"Episodes in bold are continuous episodes, where the story spans over 2 or more episodes."
"The series picks up the story arc from ""Stargate SG-1""'s ""Lost City"", where people from all around the world come together to form an expedition and discover the wonders of Atlantis. Discovering that they have been cut off from Earth, they must fend for themselves, and discover a powerful new enemy bent on human subjugation."
"The story continues when the Daedalus arrives and renews the expedition's connection to Earth. This takes place alongside the Ori story arc in SG-1, and the Wraith become an even larger threat in the Pegasus Galaxy. But what they deal with in their second year might be more than they can handle, and Dr. Carson Beckett's retrovirus is more trouble than it's worth."
"This season concentrates on more character driven stories. Along with new insight on the characters, the expedition discovers a new threat, one that could be the precursor to the Replicators. Some important characters leave the series in this season, and the fate of Atlantis once again is in the hands of the humans from Earth."
"Amanda Tapping (Col. Samantha Carter) joined the cast as a regular for 14 episodes, Jewel Staite (Dr. Jennifer Keller) became a recurring character for eight episodes, while regular cast member Torri Higginson (Dr. Weir) became a recurring cast member for four episodes. The season started September 28, 2007, airing on the SCI FI channel in the United States. In the United Kingdom, the season premiered on Tuesday, October 9, 2007 on Sky One."
"After being a regular character in season four, Amanda Tapping (Colonel Samantha Carter) became a guest star in several episodes. Robert Picardo (Richard Woolsey) joined the cast as a permanent character as Woolsey assumes command of Atlantis. Actress Jewel Staite (Dr. Jennifer Keller) was promoted from a recurring character to a permanent cast member. Michael Shanks (Dr. Daniel Jackson) and Paul McGillion (Dr. Carson Beckett) appeared as guest stars in this season, with McGillion appearing in five episodes. Actress Torri Higginson had stated that she would not be reprising her role as Dr. Elizabeth Weir in the fifth season. Rainbow Sun Francks as Aiden Ford was given a brief cameo appearance in ""Search and Rescue"". This was the last season of Stargate Atlantis."
"After the August 20, 2008 announcement that Season 5 of Atlantis would be its last, it was announced the following day that the series would be continued with at least one direct-to-DVD movie. More movies were expected to follow in the ""Atlantis"" series if the first movie had been successful. However, this first project (entitled """") was put on hold and eventually got shelved permanently in 2011."
"Stargate Atlantis Fan's Choice is a Special Edition Blu-ray, released on August 9, 2009, which contained two episodes voted for by fans. The episodes chosen were the first, ""Rising"", and last, ""Enemy at the Gate"", episodes of the series. The cover artwork was also submitted by fans, with the eventual winner being William Johnson of New York City."

= = = Quaker Oats Company = = =
"The Quaker Oats Company, known as Quaker, is an American food conglomerate based in Chicago. It has been owned by PepsiCo since 2001."
Quaker Oats was founded in 1901 by the merger of four oat mills:
"The company expanded into numerous areas, including other breakfast cereals and other food and drink products, and even into unrelated fields such as toys."
"Quaker Oats in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, was photographed during the 1930s by Theodor Horydczak, who documented the building, operations, and factory workers at the plant."
"During World War II, the company, through its subsidiary the Q. O. Ordnance Company, operated the Cornhusker Ordnance Plant, which manufactured millions of pieces of various artillery munitions (41 warehouses and 219 magazines of total 280,800 ft² were built)."
"In 1968, a plant was built in Danville, Illinois. This plant currently makes Aunt Jemima pancake mixes, Oat Squares, Life Cereals Quaker Oh's, Bumpers, Quisp, King Vitamin Natural Granola Cereals, and Chewy granola bars, as well as Puffed Rice for use as an ingredient for other products in other plants."
"In 1969, Quaker acquired Fisher-Price, a toy company and spun it off in 1991."
"In the 1970s, the company financed the making of the film ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"", obtaining in return a license to use a number of the product names mentioned in the movie for candy bars."
"In 1982 Quaker Oats purchased US Games, a company that created games for the Atari 2600. It went out of business after one year. That same year, Quaker Oats acquired Florida-based orange juice plant Ardmore Farms, which it would own until selling it to Country Pure Foods in 1998."
"In 1983, Quaker bought Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., makers of Van Camp's and Gatorade."
"Quaker bought Snapple for $1.7 billion in 1994 and sold it to Triarc in 1997 for $300 million. Triarc sold it to Cadbury Schweppes for $1.45 billion in September 2000. It was spun off in May 2008 to its current owners, Dr Pepper Snapple Group."
"In 1996, Quaker spun off its frozen food business, selling it to Aurora Foods (which was bought by Pinnacle Foods in 2004)."
"In August 2001, Pepsico acquired Quaker Oats for $14 billion dollars."
"The major Canadian production facility for Quaker Oats is located in Peterborough, Ontario. The factory was first established as the American Cereal Company in 1902 on the shores of the Otonabee River during that city's period of industrialization. At the time, the city was known as ""The Electric City"" due to its hydropower resources, attracting many companies to the site to take advantage of this source. The Trent–Severn Waterway also promised to provide an alternate shipping route from inland areas around the city, although it appears this was never used in practice. On 11 December 1916, the factory all but completely burned to the ground. When the smoke had settled, 23 people had died and Quaker was left with $2,000,000 in damages. Quaker went on to rebuild the facility, incorporating the few areas of the structure that were not destroyed by fire."
"When PepsiCo purchased Quaker Oats in 2001, many brands were consolidated from facilities around Canada to the Peterborough location, which assumed the new QTG (Quaker Tropicana Gatorade) moniker. Local production includes Quaker Oatmeal, Quaker Chewy bars, Cap'n Crunch cereal, Aunt Jemima instant pancake mixes and pancake syrups, Quaker Oat Bran and Corn Bran cereals, Gatorade sports drinks and the Propel fitness water sub-brand, Tropicana juices, and various Frito-Lay snack products. Products are easily identified by the ""manufactured by"" address on the packaging. The Peterborough facility exports to the majority of Canada and limited portions of the United States. The Quaker plant sells cereal production byproducts to companies that use them to create fire logs and pellets."
"Starting in 1902, the company's oatmeal boxes came with a coupon redeemable for the legal deed to a tiny lot in Milford, Connecticut. The lots, sometimes as small as 10 feet by 10 feet, were carved out of a 15-acre, never-built subdivision called ""Liberty Park"". A small number of children (or their parents), often residents living near Milford, redeemed their coupons for the free deeds and started paying the extremely small property taxes on the ""oatmeal lots"". The developer of the prospective subdivision hoped the landowners would hire him to build homes on the lots, although several tracts would need to be combined before building could start. The legal deeds created a large amount of paperwork for town tax collectors, who frequently couldn't find the property owners and received almost no tax revenue from them. In the mid-1970s, the town put an end to the oatmeal lots with a ""general foreclosure"" condemning nearly all of the property, which is now part of a BiC Corporation plant."
"In 1955, Quaker Oats again gave away land as part of a promotion, this one tied to the ""Sergeant Preston of the Yukon"" television show in the United States. The company offered in its Puffed Wheat and Puffed Rice cereal boxes genuine deeds to land in the Klondike."
"The Quaker Oats logo starting in 1877 had a figure of a Quaker man depicted full-length, sometimes holding a scroll with the word ""Pure"" written across it, resembling the classic woodcuts of William Penn, the 17th-century philosopher and early Quaker. Quaker Oats advertising dating back to 1909 did, indeed, identify the ""Quaker man"" as William Penn, and referred to him as ""standard bearer of the Quakers and of Quaker Oats."""
"In 1946, graphic designer Jim Nash created a black-and-white head-and-shoulders portrait of the smiling Quaker Man, and Haddon Sundblom's now-familiar color head-and-shoulders portrait (using fellow Coca-Cola artist Harold W. McCauley as the model) debuted in 1957. The monochromatic 1969 Quaker Oats Company logo, modeled after the Sundblom illustration, was created by Saul Bass, a graphic designer known for his motion picture title sequences and corporate logos. In 2012, the company enlisted the firm of Hornall Anderson to give the 'Quaker man' a slimmer, somewhat younger look. The man is now sometimes referred to as ""Larry"" by insiders at Quaker Oats."
"And in 1965, a new advertising slogan was introduced: ""Nothing is better for thee, than me""."
"The company states that their current 'Quaker man' logo ""does not represent an actual person. His image is that of a man dressed in Quaker garb, chosen because the Quaker faith projected the values of honesty, integrity, purity and strength."""
"The company has never had any ties with the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). When the company was being built up, Quaker businessmen were known for their honesty (truth is often considered a Quaker testimony). ""The Straight Dope"" writes ""According to the good folks at Quaker Oats, the Quaker Man was America's first registered trademark for a breakfast cereal, his registration taking place on September 4th, 1877."""
"Members of the Religious Society of Friends have occasionally expressed frustration at being confused with the Quaker Oats representation. In recent years, Friends have twice protested the Quaker name being used for advertising campaigns seen as promoting violence. In 1990, some Quakers started a letter-writing campaign after a Quaker Oats advertisement depicted Popeye as a ""Quakerman"" who used violence against aliens, sharks, and Bluto. Later that decade, more letters were sparked by Power Rangers toys included in Cap'n Crunch cereal."
"From 1946-1953, researchers from Quaker Oats Company, MIT and Harvard University carried out experiments at the Walter E. Fernald State School to determine how the minerals from cereals were metabolized. Parents of mentally challenged children were asked for permission to let their children be members of a ""Science Club"" and participate in research. Being a member of the Science Club gave the children special privileges. The parents were told that the children would be fed with a diet high in nutrients. They were not told that the food their children were fed contained radioactive calcium and iron, and the consent form contained no information indicating this. The information obtained from the experiments was to be used as part of an advertising campaign. The company was later sued because of the experiments. The lawsuit was settled on 31 December 1997."
"In 2010, two California consumers filed a class action lawsuit against the Quaker Oats Company. Plaintiffs allege that Quaker marketed its products as healthy even though they contained unhealthy trans fat. Specifically, Quaker's Chewy Granola Bars, Instant Oatmeal, and Oatmeal to Go Bars contained trans fat, yet their packaging featured claims like ""heart healthy,"" ""wholesome,"" and ""smart choices made easy."""
"Originally released as a bootable CD-ROM called MeshAP based on the OpenAP open source software, the system is now implemented as system image which can fit within a small 32MB CompactFlash card. The system functions have expanded beyond creating wireless networks to provide set-top box services, MP3 audio and video streaming, connection to remote windows terminal servers, other PCs, web browsing, connection to peer-to-peer networks, instant messaging and file exchange."

"Project Boreas was a study conducted between 2003 and 2006 by the British Interplanetary Society to design a station on the Planum Boreum at the Martian North Pole. The project was international, involving over 25 scientists and engineers, co-ordinated by Charles S. Cockell. Pole Station was designed to operate for three summers and two polar winters. Amongst a diversity of scientific objectives the station occupants were to retrieve a deep core from within the Martian polar ice cap and search for water and habitable conditions deep in the polar ice cap. Expeditions were planned to numerous locations across the Martian north polar cap, including the Chasma Boreale and the polar layered terrains. The study involved wide-ranging investigations of the scientific priorities for a human presence at the Martian polar ice caps through to detailed architectural and design studies for the station. Studies were undertaken on mobility and communications and psycho-social issues for long-term operation at the Martian polar station."
"Project Boreas was named for the Greek god of the North Wind. Concepts for polar bases had been discussed in earlier papers The station was designed with the assumption that it would be occupied by 10 people. Although the station could be constructed at any time, the study used a timeframe of 2037 to 2042 to provide a backdrop for the design. It is likely that in the coming decades robots will explore the Martian polar caps, which were first observed by Italian astronomer, Giovanni Cassini in 1666. Project Boreas considered long-term human polar exploration on Mars."
"The crew of the station were envisaged to carry out diverse scientific studies in geology, geophysics, climatology and astrobiology. One particular advantage of humans was perceived to be their ability to run a laboratory in which complex and analytical tasks can be undertaken in polar science and exploration. The design study considered that the retrieval of a core into the polar ice cap would be one of the primary objectives of Pole Station. The core would be used to study past geological and climatological changes, including dating past Martian dust storms. The core would also be used to investigate the nature of the polar layered terrains. It would be used to study whether the ice caps contained a record of organics on Mars, to search for habitats in the ice and to study questions on the past and present habitability of Martian polar ices. The occupants also had diverse climatology objectives to undertake. The study considered Martian polar astronomy to be a potentially useful additional activity for the station crew members."
During the 1173 sol-stay on the Martian surface the crew would carry out a number of expeditions across the polar ice cap. Expeditions to the Chasma Boreale and along the polar spiral valleys were considered in detail. The study also considered the possibility of exploratory mid-winter expeditions across the polar ice cap. These expeditions would be supported by pressurised and unpressurised rovers. Trafficability issues of trans-polar expeditions were considered.
"The study carried out a trade off analysis of power, thermal control and other parameters to provide a basis for the architectural design. The station would be constructed from six linked modules of 3.5 m diameter with a smaller cache module. The modules included a galley area, science and human factors laboratories, EVA preparation area and personal quarters. The station would have a ‘garden’ area to provide some fresh food and for psychological relief. The station would be supported by nuclear power and a hybrid physico-chemical and biological life support system. Provision for in-situ resource use (ISRU) from the Martian polar regions was studied, particular emphasis being placed on the availability of water from the polar ices. The station would support a separate small drilling encampment nearby and would be surrounded by radiative panels which would sublime the 2 m of carbon dioxide snow estimated to fall at Pole Station during the winter, allowing for year-round operations."
"Project Boreas considered the use of bioinspired robots to support Pole Station. ‘Arctic fox’, ‘Arctic hare’, ‘snow bunting’ (a flying robot) and ‘lemmings’ would support science and exploration objectives from Pole Station by enabling remotely controlled data collection at many spatial scales either from the rovers or from the station. The design study investigated communications for Pole Station and satellite requirements for sustaining base to field communications. The unique psycho-social issues associated with the long and permanently dark Martian polar winter were addressed. Medical requirements for long-term operation at the Martian polar ice caps were investigated in addition to the nutrition requirements, which were used to constrain the life support system design."
"The Project Boreas report was shortlisted for the 2007 Sir Arthur Clarke Award in the category of ""Best Written Presentation""."

"Achala Sachdev (3 May 1920 – 30 April 2012) was an Indian film actress who appeared in classic films of Bollywood. She was from Peshawar who started her career as a child actor. She later became known for mother and grandmother roles in Hindi films. Her most memorable roles were as Balraj Sahni's wife in the 1965 film ""Waqt"" and Kajol's grandmother in ""Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge"" (1995)."
Achala Sachdev was born on 3 May 1920 in Peshawar.
"Achala worked for All India Radio, Lahore before the partition of India, and then at Delhi All India Radio. Achala made her film debut with ""Fashionable Wife"" (1938), and acted in over 130 Hindi films. She has acted in many Yash Raj Films, starting with Yash Chopra's first production """" (1973) and films such as ""Chandni"" (1989) and ""Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge"" (1995). Her other noted films were ""Prem Pujari"", ""Mera Naam Joker"", ""Hare Rama Hare Krishna"" and ""Andaz"", apart from acting in English films such as the Mark Robson's ""Nine Hours to Rama"" (1963) and Merchant Ivory's ""The Householder"" (1963). However, her most noted role remains as Balraj Sahani's wife in ""Waqt"" (1965), wherein the hit song ""Ae Meri Zohra Jabeen"" was picturised on her."
"Achala became a resident of Pune after marrying Clifford Douglas Peters, who had a factory in Pune's Bhosari industrial estate, named Morris Electronics, producing small electronics parts such as diodes. The factory was later sold to the Piramal Group. In an almost filmy turn, Sachdev was introduced to Peters by Yash Chopra on the sets of a film in Mumbai. Peter's first wife had died by then and Sachdev herself was a divorcee. They married. Peters, a mechanical engineer, had a factory in Bhosari and the couple lived in a bungalow in the same area for some time before shifting to Hadapsar. After Peters died, Achala lived alone. Five years before her death, she gave away her flat in Pune to the Janseva Foundation, a charitable organization, on the condition that they should take care of her as long as she lived."
"In September 2011, Achala slipped and fell in her kitchen. She sustained a fracture in her leg. After that, she was diagnosed with multiple embolisms in her brain. This resulted in total paralysis and the loss of her vision. She was survived by son Jyotin."

Players named to the EISL All-League Third Team included defender Carlton Williams. Players receiving All-League Honorable Mentions included defender Abraham Francois and midfielder Jamie Harding."
"After the season, in late September 1998, the team fired its five-person staff, including head coach Scott Cooper and general manager Jim Krause, citing ""significant"" financial losses. Team president Bryan Dresden said he would not move or fold the team but that additional local investors were required for the team to continue. This became moot when the EISL itself folded in late December 1998."

"Clouds of Sils Maria (known simply as Sils Maria in some territories) is a 2014 drama film written and directed by Olivier Assayas, and starring Juliette Binoche, Kristen Stewart, and Chloë Grace Moretz. The film is a French-German-Swiss co-production. Principal photography took place from August to October 2013, with most of the filming taking place in Sils Maria, Switzerland. The film follows an established middle-aged actress (Binoche) who is cast as the older lover in a romantic lesbian drama opposite an upstart young starlet (Moretz). She is overcome with personal insecurities and professional jealousies—all while sexual tension simmers between her and her personal assistant (Stewart). The screenplay was written with Binoche in mind and incorporates elements from her life into the plot."
"""Clouds of Sils Maria"" was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or in the main competition section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival on 23 May 2014, and also screened at the Toronto International Film Festival and New York Film Festival. The film received positive reviews, with critics lauding the work as psychologically complex and praising the lead actresses' performances. It won the Louis Delluc Prize for Best Film in December 2014, and received six César Award nominations. Stewart received the César Award for Best Supporting Actress in February 2015."
"Maria Enders (Juliette Binoche) is an international film star and stage actress. She travels with a loyal young American assistant, Valentine (Kristen Stewart). Twenty years earlier, Maria got her big break when she was cast and successfully performed as a young girl ""Sigrid"" in both the play and film versions of """" by Wilhelm Melchior, a Swiss playwright who is now elderly. The play centers on the tempestuous relationship between Sigrid and ""Helena,"" a vulnerable older woman. Helena commits suicide after Sigrid takes advantage of her, and dumps her."
"While traveling to Zurich to accept an award on behalf of Wilhelm, and planning to visit him at home the following day at his house in Sils Maria – a remote settlement in the Alps – Maria learns of his death. His widow Rosa later confides that Wilhelm had ended his life and had been terminally ill. During the awards ceremony, Maria is approached by Klaus Diesterweg, a popular theater director. He wants to persuade her to appear on stage in ""Maloja Snake"" again, but this time in the role of Helena, the older woman."
"Maria is torn and reluctantly accepts. To prepare for the role, she accepts Rosa's offer to stay at the Melchiors' house in Sils Maria. Rosa is leaving to escape her memories of Wilhelm. Maria's discussions with Valentine and their read-throughs of the play's scenes evoke uncertainty about the nature of their relationship. A young American actress, 19-year-old Jo-Ann Ellis (Chloë Grace Moretz), has been chosen to interpret the role of Sigrid. Researching her on Google and the internet, Valentine tells Maria, who is out of touch with social media, that Ellis has been involved in numerous scandals."
"Questions soon multiply regarding aging, time, culture and the blurring line between the Sigrid/Helena and the Valentine/Maria relationships. Maria and Jo-Ann finally meet, but their relationship is complicated. Jo-Ann appears to be implicated in the attempted suicide of the wife of her new (and married) boyfriend."
"During their time at Sils Maria, Maria and Valentine spend much of their days hiking in the Alps. On one such final outing, they hike to the Maloja Pass – to observe a fascinating early morning cloud phenomenon that appears low in the pass (the ""Maloja Snake"" of the play's title, but also the ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" in the film's title). Valentine suggests that Helena may not commit suicide but simply walk away to start a new life. Maria protests that Helena walks into the mountains never to return and must therefore be dead. After suggesting that their approaches to the play are too different for her (Valentine) to be a useful assistant, a disconsolate Valentine disappears without explanation, never to reappear."
"A few weeks later, a young filmmaker who has previously sent a script to Maria visits her by appointment five minutes before the curtain rises on the opening night of ""Maloja Snake"" in London. Maria seems preoccupied, so near to curtain rise, and dismisses his suggested ideas about the proposed film role he is offering her as ""too abstract for me"". When she says the role he has written is too young for her and would suit Jo-Ann better, he suggests that the character is ageless and that he does not relate to his era with its internet scandals and trashy values. Clearly he admires her and her work. Maria does not give him a reply as to whether she will take part in the film. Then she is on stage, smoking and waiting for Sigrid."
"Principal photography of ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" began on 22 August 2013 and ended on 4 October. The film was shot on location in the titular village of Sils Maria, Switzerland as well as Zurich; Leipzig, Germany; and South Tyrol, Italy."
"In an interview, Olivier Assayas said that all the film's interiors were shot in Germany. The production moved to Sils Maria to film the hiking scenes, and moved again to film the scenes in and around the chalet in South Tyrol."
"The Chanel company debuted in film financing with this production. In addition it supplied the actresses with clothes, jewelry, accessories, and makeup, and the brand was scripted in as a provider of the same to Maria. Chanel provided some of the budget to allow Olivier Assayas to fulfill his dream of shooting a film on 35-mm film instead of digitally."
"Assayas has described the fictional play ""Maloja Snake"" as a ""condensed, brutalized version"" of ""The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant,"" a play by Rainer Werner Fassbinder (it was later adapted as a film of the same name)."
"The American title of the film is ""Clouds of Sils Maria."" In France the film was released as ""Sils Maria,"" Assayas' original name."
The first trailer for the film was released on 22 May 2014. Another international trailer followed on 7 July.
The film was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or in the main competition section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival on 23 May 2014. It also screened at the Toronto International Film Festival and New York Film Festival.
"""Clouds of Sils Maria"" premiered at the Cannes Film Festival to positive reviews."
"Robbie Collin of ""The Daily Telegraph"" stated, ""This is a complex, bewitching and melancholy drama, another fearlessly intelligent film from Assayas."" He said, ""Binoche plays the role with elegance and melancholic wit – her character slips between fiction and fact in a way that recalls her role in Abbas Kiarostami's ""Certified Copy."" But it's Stewart who really shines here. Valentine is probably her best role to date: she's sharp and subtle, knowable and then suddenly distant, and a late, surprising twist is handled with a brilliant lightness of touch."""
"Peter Debruge of ""Variety"" said it was Assayas' ""daring rejoinder, a multi-layered, femme-driven meta-fiction that pushes all involved—including next-gen starlets Kristen Stewart and Chloë Grace Moretz — to new heights."" Matt Risley of ""Total Film"" called it ""an elegant, intelligent drama, enlivened by strong performances by Binoche, Moretz and especially Stewart, for whom this will surely usher in a new dawn."""
"Stephanie Zacharek of ""The Village Voice"" wrote: ""But the movie's true center, the meteorological phenomenon that makes it so pleasurable to watch, is the half-prickly, half-affectionate interplay between Binoche and Stewart."" Ben Sachs of ""Chicago Reader"" wrote: ""This recalls Ingmar Bergman's chamber dramas in the intensity and psychological complexity of the central relationship, yet the filmmaking is breathtakingly fluid, evoking a sense of romantic abandon."""
"However, Kyle Smith of the ""New York Post"" writes: ""A backstage drama that has all the sizzle of a glass of water resting on the windowsill, [...] ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" mistakes lack of dramatic imagination for smoldering subtlety."" Richard Brody from ""The New Yorker"" writes: ""Clouds of Sils Maria, as the title suggests, is a sort of travelogue, a commercial for European cultural tourism, and, as such, it's the perfect image of the very system that created it. There's almost no independent filmmaking in France, and there isn't supposed to be. If there were, it would stand as a threat to the system that, by way of training, enticements, and restrictions, is the source of the comforts that the movie depicts and that the movie reflects. The mediocrity is stifling."""
"The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports a ""Certified Fresh"" score of 90% based on 169 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Bolstered by a trio of powerful performances from its talented leads, ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" is an absorbing, richly detailed drama with impressive depth and intelligence."" On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted mean score of 78 out of 100, based on 41 reviews from film critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews""."
"""Clouds of Sils Maria"" opened in France on 20 August 2014 in 150 theaters for a $3,663 per theater average and a box office total of $549,426 as of 24 August 2014. The film expanded to 195 theaters in its second week of release, and the box office increased to an estimated $1,150,090."
"""Clouds of Sils Maria"" opened in the United States on 10 April 2015 in three theaters and grossed $69,729 on its opening weekend for an average of $23,243 per. As of 4 June 2015, the film has grossed an estimated $1,743,577 after expanding theaters."
"The film won the Louis Delluc Prize for Best Film in December 2014. The film received six César Award nominations including best film, best director, best actress, best original screenplay, and best cinematography, while Stewart won for best supporting actress, becoming the first American actress to win a César and the second American actor to win after Adrien Brody in 2003."
"The film was released on DVD and Digital HD by Paramount Home Media on July 14, 2015; the company also handles the digital entertainment sales, with IFC handling the video on demand sales."
The Criterion Collection released a DVD and Blu-ray edition on 28 June 2016.
"Other steam systems were opened in Devonport, Wellington and Christchurch."
"The first electric tram ran to Maori Hill, Dunedin in 1900, and the tram systems in the main centres were all electrified in the 1900s."
Dunedin also had several Cable Car lines to various suburbs and Wellington still has the Wellington Cable Car (actually a funicular) to Kelburn.
"Most twentieth-century systems were electric with overhead wires, apart from the Takapuna (Auckland) steam tramway (1910–1927) and Gisborne, which had two battery-electric trams (1913–1929). The only system to be closed during this period was Napier, in 1931 after the Napier earthquake. Several long suburban lines were replaced by buses, e.g. Christchurch City to Richmond, Burwood and North Beach in 1934, and to Linwood in 1936."
"During the 1950s and early 1960s all the tramway systems were replaced by buses or trolleybuses: Wanganui (1950), Invercargill (1952), Christchurch and New Plymouth (1954), Auckland and Dunedin (1956) and Wellington (1964). This followed a general international trend, especially in North American and British cities. The traditional tram systems of the period were perceived as a slow and outdated means of transport, characterised by inflexible routes and expensive infrastructure maintenance. In Wellington there was significant opposition to the closure of the last tramway system in New Zealand, and the final decision to disestablish the remaining lines followed on a public referendum in 1959."
"All trolleybus systems in New Zealand have now been closed: Christchurch (1956), New Plymouth (1967), Auckland (1980), Dunedin (1982) and Wellington (2017)."
"Auckland City had a private company operating horse-drawn trams from 1884. The Auckland Electric Tram Company's system was officially opened on 17 November 1902, but public service was delayed because three of the motormen, from Sydney, Australia, had been drowned in the SS Elingamite shipwreck near Three Kings Islands on 9 November 1902. Public service commenced on 23 November 1902 and continued to 29 December 1956."
"With services running from downtown at the Waitematā Harbour, across to Onehunga on the Manukau Harbour, Auckland had the world's only 'coast to coast' tramway system. The Electric Tram Company started as a private company before being acquired by Auckland City Council. The resulting council owned entity was required to run services outside the borders of Auckland City."
"In 1938, a circular trolleybus route opened, operating from Queen Street - Wyndham Street - Hobson Street - Victoria Street and servicing the Farmers department store in Hobson Street. Trolleybuses may have been chosen for this service because the corner of Queen Street and Wyndham Street was too sharp and steep for trams. Electric trams operated a similar Farmers department store connection from a terminus stop in Beresford Street off Pitt Street along Hobson Street to a terminus stop in Wyndham Street."
"From 1949 a modernisation programme saw the electric tram routes being replaced by trolleybuses, commencing with the Herne Bay route and with trolleybuses eventually replicating the entire network by December 1956 when the last electric tram ran."
"While the introduction of two light rail lines became a government commitment in 2018, as of there are only two tram services in Auckland, the Western Springs Tramway and the Wynyard loop tram. Both are heritage systems. The Western Springs Tramway runs between two MOTAT museum sites. The tracks run parallel to part of the original Point Chevalier tram route on Great North Road, but they were not part of the original system."
"Also known as the Wynyard Quarter tram and Dockline Tram. Operates on a circuit close to downtown Auckland. The route consists of the loop Halsey Street, Gaunt Street, Daldy Street and Jellicoe Street. There have been proposals to extend this in the future. The service was promoted and funded by the former Auckland Regional Council and now by Panuku Development Auckland. The tramway is operated by Auckland Tramways, administered by Panuku Development Auckland. Trams commenced testing and crew training on Friday 29 July 2011. The system was opened on 6 August 2011, prior to the 2011 Rugby World Cup."
"Three former Melbourne trams have been used. X1 class 466, (was for a time 2011-2017 renumbered ATL 257), is being leased from the Newstead Trams based at Bendigo Tramways and arrived at the Ports of Auckland by ship 8 June 2011 and was delivered to the new tram shed 15 June 2011. From 2011 until 2015, Melbourne W2 class 421, then numbered ATL 258 was leased from Bendigo. In July 2015, SW6 model trams 852 and 881 arrived from Melbourne after becoming surplus to requirements. In September 2011, MOTAT's Western Springs Tramway loaned restored 1906 Auckland tram No.44 for the Auckland Heritage Festival and through the summer 2011/12. No.44 was loaned again in September and early October 2012."
"The Dockline Tramway has closed a number of times for the gentrification of streets around Wynyard Quarter which have involved relevelling the roads. For instance in until October 2014, and again from mid 2015 until late 2016 while Gaunt Street and the southern end of Daldy Street were gentrified. In April 2017, trams ran on a short section of the line while roadworks and gentrification took place in Halsey Street and Daldy Street, including watergardens and realignment of the tramway along the reinstated Daldy Street. The Tramway was suspended indefinitely on 5 August 2018 due to Panuku selling an area that included part of its tracks to a developer, but was given a reprieve on 22 November 2018 with Auckland Councillors voting to reinstate the full original loop and have the tram running for Americas Cup 2021, then review its future."
Devonport on Auckland's North Shore had a horse tramway from September 1886 to 1888 running to Cheltenham Beach. The tramway utilised wooden rails and failed financially after two years.
"A steam tramway operated between Bayswater and Milford on Auckland's North Shore. It travelled along Lake Road, through Takapuna and circled Lake Pupuke between 22 December 1910 and 26 April 1927. The steam tram trailers had been built so that they could be converted to electric operation, to a similar design to Auckland M & L type trams. The carriages were hauled by 13"" steam motors, built by Baldwin Locomotive Works of Philadelphia. The tramway struggled financially, and closed after 16 years. The carriages were sold to Wanganui and Dunedin and converted to electric trams and the steam tram boilers sold for other uses. A single trailer, which became a Dunedin electric tram ""Takapuna"" No.66, is the sole survivor, at the Otago Early Settlers Museum."
"Christchurch had steam and horse trams from 1880, then electric trams from 6 June 1905 to 11 September 1954. They were replaced by trolleybuses and motor buses. A Christchurch heritage tram line was established in the city centre on a loop track in 1995, and reopened on a limited circuit in November 2013 after being temporarily non-operational following the Christchurch earthquake of 2011, which interrupted tramway services while the CBD was cordoned off. The Tramway reopened November 27, 2013 on a combination of the original route and an extension that was in progress at the time of the earthquakes. There are plans to extend the route in 2014 to include the full pre-earthquake circuit and the extension through the Re:Start Mall and High Street which was nearly complete when the February 2011 earthquake struck."
"In Dunedin electric trams operated on several routes from 23 October 1900 (Maori Hill) and 24 December 1903 (municipal service, to Normanby & Gardens) to 29 March 1956, and were replaced by trolleybuses and buses."
"Gisborne had Edison-Beach battery-electric trams from 13 April 1913 to 8 July 1929. There were two trams from the Federal Storage Battery Car Co, New Jersey and two from Boon & Co, Christchurch. AR Harris of Christchurch was the New Zealand agent for Edison Batteries. The trams were slow; their maximum speed was 32 km/hour, and initially they were restricted by the Public Works Department to 16 km/hour. There were two inland routes: Ormond Rd, and Gladstone Rd to Te Hapara (Lytton Rd). They were replaced by buses, following a close referendum in 1928."
Auckland Weekly News had photos of the interior and exterior of trams at the 1913 opening.
"Invercargill had the southernmost tram system in the world, horse trams 1881–1908, electric trams from 26 March 1912 to 10 September 1952. They were replaced by buses."
"Construction began in January 1911 and lines to Waikiwi and Georgetown opened on 26 March 1912. Later that year two more lines opened, to North Invercargill and South Invercargill; the latter was the southernmost electrified street tram line in the world and ran to Tramway Road. The network operated as two routes: Route A between Georgetown and Waikiwi and Route B between North and South Invercargill. The Waikiwi line closed in 1947, though a section remained in operation until 1951. The Georgetown route closed on 2 July 1951, but the section to Rugby Park Stadium remained open until August 1951. The South Invercargill line closed on 31 May 1952. The last route, to North Invercargill, closed on 10 September 1952."
"Napier had electric trams to Port Ahuriri, from 8 September 1913 to 3 February 1931. The system was damaged by the Napier earthquake on 3 February 1931, and was never restored, being replaced by buses."
"New Plymouth had an electric tram service from 10 March 1916 to 23 July 1954, operated by the New Plymouth Corporation Tramways and reputedly the smallest municipality in the world to operate trams on the overhead electricity system. There were two main routes, through the town centre from the Port to Fitzroy, and from the town centre to David Street, Westown. In 1924 a short line was built to Pukekura Park (this closed in 1937) and proposals were also made for lines to Vogletown and Frankleigh Park."
"In 1950 the Westown route was replaced with a fleet of 4 Crossley trolleybuses in 1950, in turn being replaced with diesel buses in October 1967. The Port-Fitzroy route was replaced directly by diesel buses in 1954."
"There were 10 trams, 4 single-truck Boon cars (No.s 1–4), 3 Double-truck Boon cars (Nos 5–6 and 10) and 3 Birney Safety Cars introduced in 1921 (Nos. 7–9). These all lasted until closure of the system, at which time the bodies were auctioned off and sold. Only one tram body survives (Birney No 8) and is currently in Wanganui."
"Whanganui, then known as Wanganui had electric trams from 11 December 1908 to 24 September 1950. The service went two ways from the city centre, inland to Aramoho and out to Castlecliff and the Port. The Castlecliff route competed with the Castlecliff railway and the success of the trams at winning patronage led to the cancellation of passenger trains in April 1932. The trams were replaced by buses."
"Wanganui tram No.12 was restored in West Auckland by Dave Harre and his team and gifted to the people of Whanganui The Tramways Whanganui Trust has united the body onto a former Brussels Brill 21e type four-wheel truck, and plans to renovate Wanganui tram No.8 and New Plymouth Birney No.8. 120m of tramline has been laid alongside the Whanganui river between the new tram shed towards the berth of the PS Waimarie and due to be opened for demonstrations and rides once the appropriate Rail Operator Licences have been granted. Further extensions are planned."
"Wellington had steam then horse trams from 1878, then electric trams from 30 June 1904 to 2 May 1964. They were replaced by trolleybuses and buses. Wellington now has the only funicular cable car line operating in New Zealand."
"The Wellington Tramway Museum preserves and operates a collection of Wellington trams at The Kapiti Coast Electric Tramway, Queen Elizabeth Park, MacKays Crossing near Paekakariki on the Kapiti Coast. Planning for a light rail system is underway."
"Other horse-drawn tram systems were built on the West Coast of the South Island, where a gold rush started in 1864. The main towns, Greymouth, Westport, Hokitika and Ross, and smaller settlements like Brighton, Charleston, Kamiere and Kumara had wooden tramways. Publican John Behan of Charleston, now a ghost town, petitioned the Canterbury Provincial Council in 1870 for compensation after the rerouting of a wooden tramway along a branch road removed most of his stalwart drinkers. The 'bush tram' from Greymouth to Kumara took three hours, and during the trip passengers had to cross the Taramakau River in a cage or 'flying fox' suspended from a cable see photo c1880. These tramways were for freight and passengers. There were few roads on the Coast, and tramway owners were entitled to charge a toll to pedestrians walking along the tracks. The gauges varied from to , with wooden rails (see Stewart and May). Some of these were ""bush tramways"", similar to other systems used to carry timber out of the bush."
"The American firms of J G Brill, Philadelphia and John Stephenson Co, New Jersey supplied many trams, as well as other firms; English, Australian and local. Birney Safety cars were supplied by J.G. Brill Co. to Invercargill (6) and New Plymouth (3) in 1921, though they were too wide for Napier. Gordon Coates, then Minister of Transport was in New Plymouth for a test run on the new trams. When the driver showed how the 'dead man's control' worked by lifting his hand off the controller, the Minister and all were thrown to the floor when it nose dived on its front wheels then slumped back on the track with a shudder."
"His consequent arrest provoked the rebellion of the anti-Imperial faction of the Milanese, seen by 19th-century historians as fiercely patriotic. Aribert had soon escaped his imprisonment and was leading the revolt from Milan. The Emperor found himself unable to take Milan by siege and proceeded to Rome, where his diplomatic skills succeeded in isolating Aribert from his erstwhile allies, notably through his famous decree of 28 May 1037, securing the tenancy of lesser vassals, both imperial and ecclesiastical."
"The Emperor took the step of deposing the fighting archbishop, and John's successor Pope Benedict IX excommunicated Aribert in March 1038. That year, he held up the Carroccio as the symbol of Milan and soon it was the symbol of all the Tuscan cities as far as Rome. Aribert ended his episcopacy in relative peace, having agreed to cease hostilities with Henry, at Ingelheim in 1040, reconciled with him and obtained the revocation of his excommunication."
"The tomb of Aribert is located in the first span of the right aisle of Milan Cathedral. The archbishop's sarcophagus is surmounted by a copy of the famous crucifix in gilded copper foil (the original is located in the museum of Milan Cathedral) originally donated by Aribert to the monastery of San Dionigi, a convent which was later demolished in 1783."
"A reproduction of the cross of Aribert is also one of the symbols of victory at the Palio di Legnano. The historical re-enactment takes place every year on the last Sunday of May and concludes with a horse race between the eight ""contrade"" Legnanesi: the contrada winner of the competition exposes the cross for a whole year in its own church of reference until the next edition of the prize."
= = = Tomax and Xamot = = =
"Tomax and Xamot Paoli (also called the Crimson Twins or Crimson Guard Commanders) are fictional characters from the """" toyline, comic books and animated series. They are the co-leaders of Cobra's elite troops, the Crimson Guard, and debuted in 1985. Their preliminary names were Movat and Tovam respectively."
"The Paoli brothers speak in notable accents which show they are from Corsica. The brothers were at some point members of the Unione Corse (Corsican Brotherhood), served in the French Foreign Legion's 1REP in Algeria, then as mercenaries in Africa (Congo, southern Africa) and South America, before changing careers and becoming bankers in Zurich, Switzerland. Unhappy with the world of corporate finance, the brothers found the opportunities available in international terrorism far more suited to their abilities, and joined Cobra. Their specialties are in infiltration, espionage (military and industrial), sabotage, propaganda, and corporate law."
"Like the Crimson Guard that they lead, Xamot and Tomax also lead the ""respectable"" corporate face of Cobra as the founders, owners, and CEOs of Extensive Enterprises. When not engaged in terrorism, they efficiently manage Cobra's business affairs in shirt and tie. Their preferred mode of attack is through brains over brawn, using the law to serve the purposes of Cobra. They have covered their paper trail and connection to Cobra so well, that it is thought to be impossible to prove a connection between them and the terrorist organization."
"The twin brothers are mirror images of each other; Tomax's hair is parted on the right side of his head and Xamot's on the left;, the piping on their uniforms goes up the opposite side on each twin; the brothers' names are mirror images of one another. The only distinguishing mark between the two is a scar on Xamot's right cheek. Tomax and Xamot share an empathic connection commonly known as ""The Corsican Syndrome"" in which identical twins are believed to be psychically bonded, in a manner similar to The Corsican Brothers. While this is often useful, as it allows them to communicate wordlessly, finish each other's sentences, and speak in unison, it is also a liability as they feel each other's pain."
Tomax and Xamot were first released as action figures in 1985. Included in their package were laser pistols and a zip-line with skyhook.
The filecards for the 2008 version of the figures list their last name as Rogue.
"In the Marvel Comics ""G.I. Joe"" series, the twins first appeared in """" #37 (July 1985). They fight G.I. Joe forces throughout a busy amusement park, attempting to ambush Gung-Ho and Blowtorch. They are defeated when the Joes play ""possum""; the Twins don't realize the amusement park's ride has stopped their machine gun fire."
"Their forces, the Crimson Guard, are shown as capable battlefield soldiers and respectable businessmen. As the latter, they are to gain as much economic influence as possible, solely for the benefit of Cobra."
"A Joe team, assisted by Sierra Gordo revolutionaries, assaults a Cobra fortress, one of many in a style called Terror Drome. During the confrontations, the twins man a helicopter gunship and badly injure Stalker. Other Joes destroy the helicopter but the twins (and Stalker) survive. Later, the Joes completely take the fortress. Having prepared, Tomax and Xamot purposely wait until the Joes are inside before attempting to activate several explosive devices. This fails, as the Joes had brought their own explosive expert, Tripwire."
"In issue #109, the Twins and their forces do capture a squad of Joe members. They misinterpret an order from Cobra Commander and incorrectly believe that they must now execute all the Joes. While they are unwilling to outright kill the subdued prisoners, a S.A.W. Viper willingly fires into the prisoners, killing Doc, Heavy Metal, Crankcase and Thunder. The survivors injure the Viper with a hidden knife and escape. In the ensuing pursuit, the prisoners commandeer a Cobra vehicle, which is fired upon by other Cobra forces. Breaker, Crazylegs and Quick Kick are killed while the survivors make it back to Joe territory."
"Years later, in the Devil's Due series, the Twins fall under the influence of Destro's son, who has infected them with multi-function nanites. Their businesses still continue, such as working with Ripper to promote his soda company. After the nanite threat is neutralized, the twins activate Crimson Guardsmen in order to provide support to the now-free Cobra Commander."
"They continue to broker most deals for Cobra. The twins lead the unsuccessful hunt for the Cobra Island Joe infiltrator, ""Barrel Roll"", and were in charge of the secret construction of Monolith Base in Badhikstan, but after G.I. Joe raided the base, they fled with Cobra Commander to a cave. There, Red Shadows agent Dela Eden arrived and unleashed gunfire on the group."
"In the ""G.I. Joe Special Missions: Antarctica"" one-shot, a Joe team broke up an illegal oil drilling operation that was run by Tomax, who was able to escape. During the story, Xamot was strangely absent. In one scene Tomax talked to his brother as if he were present, despite the scene showing an empty chair. The whereabouts of Xamot were revealed in another story in the same issue, when G.I. Joe raided a Cobra medical facility and found Xamot, in a coma and unresponsive (presumably from the Red Shadows attack). Xamot is then held in G.I. Joe custody, still in a coma."
"Some months later, Tomax leads a raid on ""The Coffin"", a G.I. Joe maximum-security prison located in Greenland, to rescue his brother and free other Cobra operatives. He successfully frees his brother and several other Cobra agents. Off panel, the invading Cobra forces cause the death of 'loose ends' held at the Coffin, including Cobra operatives Monkeywrench and Dr. Biggles-Jones. Tomax and Xamot are captured by the Joes in the final battle with Cobra. Both are sent to the Coffin."
"Tomax and Xamot also appeared in the second ""G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers"" mini-series by Devil's Due. In it, Tomax and Xamot had used Cybertronian technology to become human-looking cyborgs who, when touching each other, shoot a massive blast. In order to avoid them using that power, Shockwave kills Xamot. Tomax later appears, grieving."
"In this new IDW continuity, Tomax and Xamot are revealed to be French and originally part of the Unione Corse. They set up their security company Extensive Enterprises, which was co-opted by Cobra; while Tomax enjoys being part of Cobra, he is unaware Xamot has become disgruntled and no longer trusts his brother. Xamot is badly beaten by Chuckles, who then self-destructs a nuclear missile payload on board a Cobra submarine, sacrificing himself and Xamot in the process. Tomax survives."
"Tomax eventually cuts a deal with GI Joe, offering to use his resources through Extensive Enterprises, to help the group find members of Cobra for captured. As part of the deal, Tomax was allowed to operate a casino in Las Vegas to create a cover that he was still involved in criminal activities, under the watchful eyes of Flint."
"Tomax and Xamot are first introduced in the """" miniseries ""Pyramid of Darkness"". They appear as the commanders of the Crimson Guard, as well as the heads of Extensive Enterprises. Unlike the comics, the twins in the cartoon were often cagey, self-interested, and eager to seize power for themselves, although they garner little support from other Cobra members, and their attempts are usually quashed by Cobra Commander. They share a psychic link, and feel one another's pain, which the Joes use to their advantage several times in battle. When the two are together and speaking, they speak in tandem, often finishing each other's sentences."
"At the beginning of the second season, Tomax and Xamot join Doctor Mindbender and Destro in creating Serpentor, also having grown tired of Cobra Commander's failures. But as soon as Serpentor is brought to life and orders his attack and invasion of the United States, Tomax and Xamot are the first to point out the sheer impossibility of such an attack. Their objections are quickly silenced however when Serpentor begins to throttle them."
"In the un-produced third season of the original Sunbow/Marvel series, Tomax and Xamot were planned to be the season's main villains, with most of Cobra-La and the Cobra Organization being destroyed at the end of the film. Tomax and Xamot would then form a new criminal organization known as ""the Coil"" to fight against the Joes. This season never went into production due to the abrupt cancellation of the series by Hasbro."
"In the cartoon, Tomax was voiced by Corey Burton and Xamot by Michael Bell."
"In """", they side with Cobra-La, and are seen fighting the Joes in the final battle, until a huge explosion destroys all of Cobra-La."
"Tomax and Xamot are not seen again in the DiC-produced third season. Their old headquarters, the Extensive Enterprises building, is seen, however, and General Hawk mentions that they closed them down. The building itself has been abandoned and is being used as a secret Cobra base. The Crimson Guard, however, are still present, in the form of the Crimson Guard Immortals. However, they are used more as a grunt force, as opposed to an elite group."
"Tomax and Xamot appear in """" voiced by Stephen Stanton, dubbing themselves as the ""Brothers of Light"" due to their psychic abilities to manipulate others into do their bidding when standing together. Their psychic link is strong to the point of empathy: if one is in pain, the other feels it. Tomax and Xamot use their powers to ""fleece"" believers whom they brainwash into their cult with a machine that enhances their psychic abilities, planning on expanding their cult worldwide. When the Joes end up in their desert oasis while searching for Doctor Mindbender, who is searching for a psychic to further his research, only Tunnel Rat and Snake Eyes manage to stay out of their control as they eventually expose the brothers' deception to their followers."
"Forced to destroy their base of operations, Tomax and Xamot convince Doctor Mindbender to take them with him to escape retaliation. However, the two soon find themselves being subjected to Mindbender's experiments in improving Bio-Vipers such as creation of the prototype Shadow-Vipers, mentally commanded by Storm Shadow. Later, during the events of the ""Union of the Snake"", Cobra attempts to use their abilities to control various telecommunication company heads. After their plan is foiled by the Joes, Tomax and Xamot manage to break free of their bonds and mesmerize Baroness and Mindbender to fight each other for their amusement, before realizing the need to escape when the authorities arrive. Soon after, the brothers ponder about spreading their cause through telecommunications."
"For best efficiency, the temperature in the condenser must be kept as low as practical in order to achieve the lowest possible pressure in the condensing steam. Since the condenser temperature can almost always be kept significantly below 100 °C where the vapor pressure of water is much less than atmospheric pressure, the condenser generally works under vacuum. Thus leaks of non-condensible air into the closed loop must be prevented."
"Typically the cooling water causes the steam to condense at a temperature of about and that creates an absolute pressure in the condenser of about , i.e. a vacuum of about relative to atmospheric pressure. The large decrease in volume that occurs when water vapor condenses to liquid creates the low vacuum that helps pull steam through and increase the efficiency of the turbines."
"The limiting factor is the temperature of the cooling water and that, in turn, is limited by the prevailing average climatic conditions at the power station's location (it may be possible to lower the temperature beyond the turbine limits during winter, causing excessive condensation in the turbine). Plants operating in hot climates may have to reduce output if their source of condenser cooling water becomes warmer; unfortunately this usually coincides with periods of high electrical demand for air conditioning."
"The condenser generally uses either circulating cooling water from a cooling tower to reject waste heat to the atmosphere, or once-through cooling (OTC) water from a river, lake or ocean. In the United States, about two-thirds of power plants use OTC systems, which often have significant adverse environmental impacts. The impacts include thermal pollution and killing large numbers of fish and other aquatic species at cooling water intakes."
"The heat absorbed by the circulating cooling water in the condenser tubes must also be removed to maintain the ability of the water to cool as it circulates. This is done by pumping the warm water from the condenser through either natural draft, forced draft or induced draft cooling towers (as seen in the adjacent image) that reduce the temperature of the water by evaporation, by about 11 to 17 °C (20 to 30 °F)—expelling waste heat to the atmosphere. The circulation flow rate of the cooling water in a 500 MW unit is about 14.2 m/s (500 ft/s or 225,000 US gal/min) at full load."
"The condenser tubes are made of brass or stainless steel to resist corrosion from either side. Nevertheless, they may become internally fouled during operation by bacteria or algae in the cooling water or by mineral scaling, all of which inhibit heat transfer and reduce thermodynamic efficiency. Many plants include an automatic cleaning system that circulates sponge rubber balls through the tubes to scrub them clean without the need to take the system off-line."
"The cooling water used to condense the steam in the condenser returns to its source without having been changed other than having been warmed. If the water returns to a local water body (rather than a circulating cooling tower), it is often tempered with cool 'raw' water to prevent thermal shock when discharged into that body of water."
"Another form of condensing system is the air-cooled condenser. The process is similar to that of a radiator and fan. Exhaust heat from the low-pressure section of a steam turbine runs through the condensing tubes, the tubes are usually finned and ambient air is pushed through the fins with the help of a large fan. The steam condenses to water to be reused in the water-steam cycle. Air-cooled condensers typically operate at a higher temperature than water-cooled versions. While saving water, the efficiency of the cycle is reduced (resulting in more carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour of electricity)."
"From the bottom of the condenser, powerful condensate pumps recycle the condensed steam (water) back to the water/steam cycle."
Power station furnaces may have a reheater section containing tubes heated by hot flue gases outside the tubes. Exhaust steam from the high-pressure turbine is passed through these heated tubes to collect more energy before driving the intermediate and then low-pressure turbines.
"External fans are provided to give sufficient air for combustion. The Primary air fan takes air from the atmosphere and, first warms the air in the air preheater for better economy. Primary air then passes through the coal pulverizers, and carries the coal dust to the burners for injection into the furnace. The Secondary air fan takes air from the atmosphere and, first warms the air in the air preheater for better economy. Secondary air is mixed with the coal/primary air flow in the burners."
"The induced draft fan assists the FD fan by drawing out combustible gases from the furnace, maintaining slightly below atmospheric pressure in the furnace to avoid leakage of combustion products from the boiler casing."
"The turbine generator consists of a series of steam turbines interconnected to each other and a generator on a common shaft. There is usually a high-pressure turbine at one end, followed by an intermediate-pressure turbine, and finally one, two, or three low-pressure turbines, and the generator. As steam moves through the system and loses pressure and thermal energy, it expands in volume, requiring increasing diameter and longer blades at each succeeding stage to extract the remaining energy. The entire rotating mass may be over 200 metric tons and long. It is so heavy that it must be kept turning slowly even when shut down (at 3 rpm) so that the shaft will not bow even slightly and become unbalanced. This is so important that it is one of only six functions of blackout emergency power batteries on site. (The other five being emergency lighting, communication, station alarms, generator hydrogen seal system, and turbogenerator lube oil.)"
"For a typical late 20th-century power station, superheated steam from the boiler is delivered through diameter piping at and to the high-pressure turbine, where it falls in pressure to and to in temperature through the stage. It exits via diameter cold reheat lines and passes back into the boiler, where the steam is reheated in special reheat pendant tubes back to . The hot reheat steam is conducted to the intermediate pressure turbine, where it falls in both temperature and pressure and exits directly to the long-bladed low-pressure turbines and finally exits to the condenser."
"The generator, typically about long and in diameter, contains a stationary stator and a spinning rotor, each containing miles of heavy copper conductor. There is generally no permanent magnet, thus preventing black starts. In operation it generates up to 21,000 amperes at 24,000 volts AC (504 MWe) as it spins at either 3,000 or 3,600 rpm, synchronized to the power grid. The rotor spins in a sealed chamber cooled with hydrogen gas, selected because it has the highest known heat transfer coefficient of any gas and for its low viscosity, which reduces windage losses. This system requires special handling during startup, with air in the chamber first displaced by carbon dioxide before filling with hydrogen. This ensures that a highly explosive hydrogen–oxygen environment is not created."
"The power grid frequency is 60 Hz across North America and 50 Hz in Europe, Oceania, Asia (Korea and parts of Japan are notable exceptions), and parts of Africa. The desired frequency affects the design of large turbines, since they are highly optimized for one particular speed."
The electricity flows to a distribution yard where transformers increase the voltage for transmission to its destination.
"The steam turbine-driven generators have auxiliary systems enabling them to work satisfactorily and safely. The steam turbine generator, being rotating equipment, generally has a heavy, large-diameter shaft. The shaft therefore requires not only supports but also has to be kept in position while running. To minimize the frictional resistance to the rotation, the shaft has a number of bearings. The bearing shells, in which the shaft rotates, are lined with a low-friction material like Babbitt metal. Oil lubrication is provided to further reduce the friction between shaft and bearing surface and to limit the heat generated."
"As the combustion flue gas exits the boiler it is routed through a rotating flat basket of metal mesh which picks up heat and returns it to incoming fresh air as the basket rotates. This is called the air preheater. The gas exiting the boiler is laden with fly ash, which are tiny spherical ash particles. The flue gas contains nitrogen along with combustion products carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. The fly ash is removed by fabric bag filters in baghouses or electrostatic precipitators. Once removed, the fly ash byproduct can sometimes be used in the manufacturing of concrete. This cleaning up of flue gases, however, only occurs in plants that are fitted with the appropriate technology. Still, the majority of coal-fired power stations in the world do not have these facilities. Legislation in Europe has been efficient to reduce flue gas pollution. Japan has been using flue gas cleaning technology for over 30 years and the US has been doing the same for over 25 years. China is now beginning to grapple with the pollution caused by coal-fired power stations."
"Where required by law, the sulfur and nitrogen oxide pollutants are removed by stack gas scrubbers which use a pulverized limestone or other alkaline wet slurry to remove those pollutants from the exit stack gas. Other devices use catalysts to remove nitrous oxide compounds from the flue-gas stream. The gas travelling up the flue-gas stack may by this time have dropped to about . A typical flue-gas stack may be tall to disperse the remaining flue gas components in the atmosphere. The tallest flue-gas stack in the world is tall at the Ekibastuz GRES-2 Power Station in Kazakhstan."
"In the United States and a number of other countries, atmospheric dispersion modeling studies are required to determine the flue-gas stack height needed to comply with the local air pollution regulations. The United States also requires the height of a flue-gas stack to comply with what is known as the ""good engineering practice"" (GEP) stack height. In the case of existing flue gas stacks that exceed the GEP stack height, any air pollution dispersion modeling studies for such stacks must use the GEP stack height rather than the actual stack height."
"Fly ash is captured and removed from the flue gas by electrostatic precipitators or fabric bag filters (or sometimes both) located at the outlet of the furnace and before the induced draft fan. The fly ash is periodically removed from the collection hoppers below the precipitators or bag filters. Generally, the fly ash is pneumatically transported to storage silos for subsequent transport by trucks or railroad cars."
"At the bottom of the furnace, there is a hopper for collection of bottom ash. This hopper is kept filled with water to quench the ash and clinkers falling down from the furnace. Arrangements are included to crush the clinkers and convey the crushed clinkers and bottom ash to a storage site. Ash extractors are used to discharge ash from municipal solid waste–fired boilers."
"Since there is continuous withdrawal of steam and continuous return of condensate to the boiler, losses due to blowdown and leakages have to be made up to maintain a desired water level in the boiler steam drum. For this, continuous make-up water is added to the boiler water system. Impurities in the raw water input to the plant generally consist of calcium and magnesium salts which impart hardness to the water. Hardness in the make-up water to the boiler will form deposits on the tube water surfaces which will lead to overheating and failure of the tubes. Thus, the salts have to be removed from the water, and that is done by a water demineralising treatment plant (DM). A DM plant generally consists of cation, anion, and mixed bed exchangers. Any ions in the final water from this process consist essentially of hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions, which recombine to form pure water. Very pure DM water becomes highly corrosive once it absorbs oxygen from the atmosphere because of its very high affinity for oxygen."
"The capacity of the DM plant is dictated by the type and quantity of salts in the raw water input. However, some storage is essential as the DM plant may be down for maintenance. For this purpose, a storage tank is installed from which DM water is continuously withdrawn for boiler make-up. The storage tank for DM water is made from materials not affected by corrosive water, such as PVC. The piping and valves are generally of stainless steel. Sometimes, a steam blanketing arrangement or stainless steel doughnut float is provided on top of the water in the tank to avoid contact with air. DM water make-up is generally added at the steam space of the surface condenser (i.e., the vacuum side). This arrangement not only sprays the water but also DM water gets deaerated, with the dissolved gases being removed by a de-aerator through an ejector attached to the condenser."
"In coal-fired power stations, the raw feed coal from the coal storage area is first crushed into small pieces and then conveyed to the coal feed hoppers at the boilers. The coal is next pulverized into a very fine powder. The pulverizers may be ball mills, rotating drum grinders, or other types of grinders."
Some power stations burn fuel oil rather than coal. The oil must kept warm (above its pour point) in the fuel oil storage tanks to prevent the oil from congealing and becoming unpumpable. The oil is usually heated to about 100 °C before being pumped through the furnace fuel oil spray nozzles.
"Boilers in some power stations use processed natural gas as their main fuel. Other power stations may use processed natural gas as auxiliary fuel in the event that their main fuel supply (coal or oil) is interrupted. In such cases, separate gas burners are provided on the boiler furnaces."
"Barring gear (or ""turning gear"") is the mechanism provided to rotate the turbine generator shaft at a very low speed after unit stoppages. Once the unit is ""tripped"" (i.e., the steam inlet valve is closed), the turbine coasts down towards standstill. When it stops completely, there is a tendency for the turbine shaft to deflect or bend if allowed to remain in one position too long. This is because the heat inside the turbine casing tends to concentrate in the top half of the casing, making the top half portion of the shaft hotter than the bottom half. The shaft therefore could warp or bend by millionths of inches."
"This small shaft deflection, only detectable by eccentricity meters, would be enough to cause damaging vibrations to the entire steam turbine generator unit when it is restarted. The shaft is therefore automatically turned at low speed (about one percent rated speed) by the barring gear until it has cooled sufficiently to permit a complete stop."
"An auxiliary oil system pump is used to supply oil at the start-up of the steam turbine generator. It supplies the hydraulic oil system required for steam turbine's main inlet steam stop valve, the governing control valves, the bearing and seal oil systems, the relevant hydraulic relays and other mechanisms."
"At a preset speed of the turbine during start-ups, a pump driven by the turbine main shaft takes over the functions of the auxiliary system."
