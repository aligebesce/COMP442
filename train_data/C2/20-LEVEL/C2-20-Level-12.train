"Oh you do,the they've looked into that."
But it sounds  doubtful to me.
But anyway  there's the insurance point of view.
"But anyway, any  I mean  that's the easy, and I mean, if, if people who are willing to drive can have experience in driving  before they take passengers out."
"I mean, I didn't drive the minibus until I'd driven it without passengers."
Yeah.

It's a shame cos if they sold the video .
"Well I may not, I may not find it as good, don't, they always show you clips as trailers of the best bit's."
I think it's .
But if it's got anything about

"if they've got the American Indian culture in it then it will fascinate me, yeah ."
"I think it has, it's  , it's got a lot of ."
"It's basically a love story between him and a, see he's a, he's a cowboy officer, and she, she's a Indian Squaw obviously, they fall in love and they all this sort of vote of comment on ."
"Yes, yes."
"But there is a lot of erm, obviously the , the Indian ways and so on."
I know they said it.
I heard them.
But a new caravan starts from eleven thousand eight hundred.
That's the price of a new one.
I know they're as good as a house almost.
"Well he said on that tape, I gave them a fat cheque of six thousand pounds."
Mm.
Well that isn't bloody  half of what we paid.
"Yeah I'm paying for mine monthly, but I won't disturb fourteen thousand seven hundred."
Perhaps perhaps he's got a  an agreement.
"Like perhaps he bought the ground and the caravan, and then they had an agreement that er  Stone Park would er  b you know let it, be responsible for when they let it or something."
Yeah.
See  there's different contracts altogether there.
Mm.
I mean he  she was going on that tape about she had to replace some things.
Mm.
She had  well I've got nothing like that.
No.
If something is gone  they replace it.
That's part of the contract.
Well everything had gone on the  one.
Well
Dishes and  furniture and
Pillows.
everything was ripped out or destroyed.
Pillows.
Well
She had to pay for eight pillows.
Mm.
We've had no bills like that.
We were asked if we wanted to do the chassis.
And  she was so toffee-nosed as if they said  the curtains.
And what did they call her?
Now she's alright.
"Now she, she picked the paper."
Used to live down the back of us.
But she's moved.
She
She picked all the paper.
"But they pa he painted, he papered every room ."
Really?
Mm mm.
"I mean, they've just had a new double glazed back door put on."
"And that, but  then one morning I we"
"But it doesn't look, it doesn't look double glazed does it?"
No.
"One morning I was off up Bambury Lane and John was waiting  to catch Paul to come  some trust or, I don't know whether it's social or what, bought a detached house on Bambury Lane cos there were an uproar."
Cos Mick started all this up there.
"And it was done  through a trust then, and it was done so quietly that they hadn't time to object."
Mm.
And  mentally  handicapped live in this house.
Well they do object.
"But they've turned this  four, five bedroomed detached house, you know, it's got a ramp now up to the front door, the front door's been altered so"
Mm mm.
"so we  made each  what was the dining room they've made into a bedroom, but just don't  that he, cos you could see  them doing it."
Mm mm.
And all that.
"In fact, Tony  's brother, Freddie, he's there  but Johnny was still outside working and he was filthy!"
Bet if I took his jacket off and put it in that washer it'd of fallen to bits cos it was that mucky.
Urgh!
Oh I thought he was like that.
Arnie was playing football.
They've gone football match at club.
So that'll be another pile of bloody washing!
The whole team fades at the moment.
"I, I, that's what I would do."
"I'd drop Mortimer now and er  keep, I wouldn't, I'd  keep McGoldrick up  don't have him as a sweeper."
I mean if you're gonna have McGoldrick as a sweeper then you'd have to bring Mortimer back but
Why not
I noticed it was quite odd that he didn't use McGoldrick as a sweeper did he?
"I mean we, we went out to win that game didn't we, again?"
"Well, don't you think?"
Yeah.
We didn't play a  and yet the defence played well enough.
So I think drop Mortimer and bring Colimore in for a full  ninety minutes and then and and again and again and again.
Get sort of like  half a dozen games.
I think drop Bright  Colimore.
Well.
"I mean Bright, I mean"
"Well yes, you could say, yes"
"you've got, you've got an excuse to drop Bright."
Bright's tired.
You could say Bright is absolutely tired.
He looks tired at the moment.
Just drop Bright .
There's no need to drop Mortimer.
Not when he's playing well.
Mm yes.
"Well he, he didn't play well in the second half though did he?"
I don't think.
He sort of
"Give me a player that did, outside"
"Yes, well, yes."
Coleman and Southgate.
"Well it  it was one of the, I mean when you saw"
"Oh look, that's where Fergie made those funny faces."
not far
I know.
Don't let it beat you.
I dunno mum.
Only a little omelette.
Yeah but it was bigger than the plate.
You had to fold it in half to get it on.
That's what I said to John I said you've got your dinner in between an omelette.
Yeah.
That's right.
I thought I could call it erm  a Spanish omelette.
What I tried to do was one of those
Did you have
ploughman's things.
did you have a surplus of eggs or something?
Pardon me.
"Well  erm, I knew you wouldn't eat sort of sliced ham on its own with erm  vegetables."
So  I knew you would eat it like that in an omelette.
Mm.
"I mean, if it had of been smaller."
"Well, I'll have a go but  I may not eat all this but  if it was smaller it's really tasty as well."
Mm.
But you liked those erm  were they countryman's or ploughman's in a packet and you just throw them into the pan and cook it for about fifteen minutes?
And that was just potatoes and eggs wasn't it?
And some cheese.
And bacon.
Don't remember.
Oh.
"What I want to do, I want to cut the shopping down as much as I possibly can."
Well I think eight pounds is a good start.
But when I go to the shops and I spend  seventy pound for a week.
We have to keep making trips back to the shop because we need  bread or milk or something else that we've forgotten.
And you've gotta guess who's
But what happened on Saturday?
house it is.
What were they doing?
"No , they, go the, you know, it might be your living room, they just put"
Oh I see!
Oh yeah!
"This week with those  swimmers they were, those two women put a peg on their nose and had their swimming hats on and was doing the act of swimming in the lane?"
No!
No .
"Apparently erm, they often do this and of course, they sort of went into their home and  got this girl with her friend and they sort of put the pegs on their noses and have these sort of  rubber hats with those"
Yeah.
", you know, like they do and they sort of pretend they're"
they pretend they're swimming
Oh!
don't they?
Yeah!
"What, and weren't they?"
Yeah.
"Well you know, she was just sat there in the chair   and they said that they"
You wouldn't believe it!
came into this room.
Would you?
No!
And sort of
And they danced.
"they sort of, they danced  you know, like they we , they would  and sort of , getting ever so silly about it actually!"
And they
I know !
Cos they did like
They didn't say anything.
"song person, that  last week, and  Terry   weeks ago."
Does anybody of you remember where Friends of the Earth England erm  analyze their expenditures.
Their income and  their finance for the last year?
I I  saw it somewhere and I got  lost track of it.
And I was appalled  as to how much they spend on publicity.
But I can't do anything with it because I lost the numbers.
Mm.
"I don't know I'll have, have a look."
I don't remember seeing
The thing is this .
Does anybody of you seen that or  remember?
No.
No.
No.
So  are we saying yes to that?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Erm  can I just ask you.
Does anybody wanna go on the energy campaign weekend?
No thank you.
And there's this  book.
Which I think we might like to  don't worry .
Erm  energy without aids.
Which I think would be  a good idea if we got it because I don't know about you but I'm always having arguments with people who say oh we can't have the whole country covered in windmills and
Mm.
things like that.
They all think nuclear powers okay.
So we really need to know our
What's the energy thing weekend just out of curiosity?
And
Good.
Right.
Go on
Mm.
He said yes.
"So I shouldn't be surprised, they're both retired  and, and er   pension."
"She said they've had  they've had a couple of days out here trekking, trying to catch people!"
"Their pension is  their pension and their bit of income  keeps them, and that's all sort of thing, in a little bit of luxury."
He  she's looking for tenants!
No.
"How, I  did you find it clean?"
Mm.
"You know, are you happy with er  arrangements"
then?
What did you think of cleanliness and
Oh well of course that
And then perhaps she'll take their names and addresses!
Yes.
"And the date see, Mrs so and so was in that caravan on such and such date!"
If ever it came to court!
Cos he said  somebody's got to bring them down!
Mm.
"And he said, we're disgusted with our caravan!"
Yes.
"Well of course, that might be a private !"
Well that's what I would say about this  if this was new I wouldn't let people go in!
"Theirs might be a private caravan on the site, and le , like Jackie's."
And letting it as private.
"See, Jackie won't let anybody in her caravan."
But she said  they've let it to people and they've just wrecked the inside of it!
Everything she said!
It's a total mess!
"And it's a brand new last July we've had it, she said!"
Mm.
And it's filthy !
Yeah.
the way a little Dachsie would you see?
Yeah.
So we talked to him but erm we didn't actually see Mrs  until about a quarter to eleven.
"And she said you know, on no account must he strain."
Obviously he's got dissolving stitches in.
On his insides.
And she said there was so little muscle  left.
It had been so stretched and strained by .
But she had to do the best she could .
Peter will .
And of course Audrey's not too quick on her feet you see since she broke her hip.
So I was trying to  help Audrey and that and help Herbie.
So Herbie didn't try and jump in the car before I could lift him and trying to get Audrey in with her stiff leg.
And then get the rug across her .
She didn't turn a hair when   she said two hundred and ninety three pounds.
I suppose it's like anything.
You get an estimate for it.
Well it's cheaper than  I suppose.
Parts and labour  .
Parts and labour.
Eh?
Does it come with a three month guarantee?
Cheaper than princess  princess Margaret or .
No Mrs  said she was very lucky.
She'd been to three lectures .
One of the topmost veterinary surgeons in Europe.
Yeah.
And that's why Mrs  asked her to do it.
She'd actually seen it done.
Seen slides and been to lectures on it.
I don't know it must be wonderful to be able to mend .
Running out of petrol just before.
"Bit of a daft time to wait to, to ."
What did he say?
Consummately easy win?
He did indeed.
Oh that's a good picture they've got there isn't it?
That's really constructive.
"That  looking at a bald head, a stupid girl, and something else."
Oh!
But why is she stupid?
I bet they show other people all that.
Getting her head in the way of the camera.
So what happened to Senna?
"I know he dropped out, but why?"
Don't know.
Oh.
Ran out of steam after eighteen laps.
If we're going to do any more quizzes this is the sort of thing we're going to need to know to do well on the sports sections.
Well I don't know.
They don't do interesting sports.
They did the firs
They do obscure ones like golf.
"ah but the, the first ques the first question on the sports section was, what team does Nigel Mansell drive for?"
Oh.
Did you get it right?
"No, we could only come up with, I forgot, but it was something Renault, and we could only think of Renault."
"Williams,Will Williams."
Yeah.
But Chris knows.
That's Renny.
Yeah.
"Here are, look, look, this groupie's getting into everything."
"You know,woh what you been doing, sort of thing!"
"And he's told her the whole story  so Noel's gone home and his mum's gone, what's that on your neck?"
"So Noel's gone  oh  someone tripped me up, I fell down the stairs and hit it on the coffee table, right!"
His mum believed him!
"So then his  Scott's mum and Noel's mum met in town  and they were just talking  and Scott's mum  it's dis , God it's disgusting isn't it  that lad given all them little lads love bites!"
And er  Noel's mum's going  well what?
I don't know what you mean!
Noel said  he'd hit it on the coffee table !
"Next day at school, Noel's come in and gone to Scott, you bastard!"
Why do you have go and tell your mum the truth for !
I'd never tell my mum that!
"Like, luckily they're"
Oh God!
"no , not very big but I've still got the one, I've still got, and it's right next to it as well!"
Mm.
Now it's yellow now it's going!
Yeah.
"But, ah"
Ah gee
ah Jesus!
I think they're
At least
really disgusting!
"Cos like, Scott was going I've never gave anyone one, you know."
"And er  Hannah's going  we started off the conversation where was the perviest you've ever had one  I mean, knowing that I didn't have one, ever had one before  and that was Mark , feeble attempt that lasted about ten minutes"
I think !
And I was really upset about that as you can imagine!
But like erm  what was I saying?
Oh yeah  so I was going what's the perviest place?
"I was thinking, you know, Scotts bound to have some pervy ones off Mandy !"
"But like er, and he was going oh I've never had one except for like, this Franny  bloke!."
Girls don't do it to boys as much as boys do it to girls though do they?
"As X becomes a very very very small number, or a large negative number, if you like to think of it that way, where X is very large."
"So, sketching a graph is not the same as plotting one."
Mm.
Any idea what that graph would be?
X squared.
"Erm, what would   not quite the right shape   what would that graph be?"
Y equals something  plus X squared.
"Right, there'd be some X squared in it."
"And there might be, it would be something X squared, and there might be something X and er well there's definitely a constant"
Mm.
Yeah.
cos when X is zero still there's Y has still got a value.
So that's going to be minus something
Mm.
so it's about minus three.
X squared  cuts
the X axis in two points.
Two points.
This one
Three points.
It's
So?
X cubed.
"So this is, there's going to be an X cubed term in here somewhere, and there might be X squared and Xs and anything else, but if it cuts it three places, it's got three r three roots."
So it's X cubed.
What about this one?
I have to sketch curves  This sort of thing.
Just touches.
Y equals X squared.
"Something like, it's going to have an X squared in it somewhere."
"It's a bit lopsided, but it's"
"Where's the X, where's the Y?"
"James right  like Mr  right he didn't know right and we have this sort of erm  water fountain and he was running towards it and he, and he  filled up his mouth with it and he was spitting it everywhere and we were all sort of getting out the way  and Mr  told him  if you don't want to drink it then leave it alone  and he sort of turned and walked away."
Mr  who's quite strict isn't he?
Yeah.
He looks
He  badminton.
James
Oh does he?
James was really unlucky.
"He sort of just come, just go up there"
James is always into trouble isn't he?
Yeah.
That's rather disgusting though
I know.
putting water in and spitting it out.
He should have remembered because  always walks down there on Fridays to do his badminton class.
Did he give him a de de detention or not?
"No, he told him to get away."
Yeah well always mucks around on Fridays don't they?
Sort of like ah no more school for about two days.
More relaxed mood.
James is very excitable
Yeah.
"Now when I, when we went to that open day that  Mr  is very stern isn't he?"
Mm yeah.
"Didn't think it helped he'd, just before we got there  his biro had exploded in his pocket ."
"All the ink was all over his shirt, it was coming out all over the place."
"I don't think he was in the best of moods when he, we got to him."
But he seemed very very stern.
He doesn't  smile very much.
No.
Terse.
We have his wife er Mrs  for English.
and the big package
that would have meant
"then it go in , in a large"
That's correct.
dimensions then you cube it.
"We're gonna do cubing in a minute, do a few exercises on cubing."
"Yes, I mean,Je Mandy said er, if we've got any consignment which exceeds one point five cubic feet per ten kilos."
But you usually know don't you if
It's lower than that actually but  er sorry
Mm mm.
it isn't.
"I, I said, yeah a cubic foot, is se , six point six then."
"That's probably right, yeah."
One point five per ten kilos.
"You can usually tell when you get used to it and we're gonna talk about visual identity in a minute, but  when the mass seems greater overly large to the weight is what  er Jen , sorry Mandy said, and I think that's a good  er er  a good er  analogy there."
"I got if erm, if the size is greater than the weight actually."
Yes.
I got that.
I'll accept that at this stage alright?
"Next question is, what's number six?"
Who can read it out?
Er six .
Can't read that word.
Notional.
Oh!
Ha.
What notional weight is used for cubing?
Six point six per cubic foot.
Did you get that right?
"I did, yes."

But I'd make
Good.
my own way there and meet them.
In a public place.

"Actually I thought they were quite nice, but Gillian er  made I Ian erm  ring the short up  cos she thought the legs weren't long enough."
"So, she tried it on her and that and I said it's fine."
But I  she'd had to lend Ian some money  the week before last so  so he could do their pocket money.
He hadn't any money so he had to borrow it off Gillian.
Mm mm.
Well they'll not be  as that.
bad we could all live in four-bedroomed detached houses can't you?
Mm.
"We well, well, you know, today what was the point of having a four bedroom?"
For show?
Mm.
"You know, you don't go from a, a one-up two-down to a two-bedroomed bung semi-bungalow and then shoot  to a four-bedroomed detached."
And then your own commonsense tells you it's gonna cost you more doesn't it?
Yeah.
"So  anyhow, money's that, he, cos he said summat on the Monday night."
Yeah I want money for  Andrew's trainers.
Oh I'll see you next week about that.
"He thinks I'm going halves with him, if he do, well he's got another shock."
He has.
Mm.
"And if he turns round and says owt, I'll say, Ian if weren't for me your kids would be naked."
I just bought Alan a new pair of jeans.
Sixteen pound out of club.
Cos I thought  needs a pair of decent jeans.
I bought them both a denim shirt.
"Alright, out of club, but it will get paid for."
Ah but see you've still got to pay for it haven't you?
What?
"At the same time it, I mean the countries wo , have been crippled by the  the burden of er  defence if you like  and we'll call it defence."
And they have!
"Erm, but in fact it's probably for some of the state that we're in now!"
But er
"I would I wouldn't sa , I wouldn't of said"
There's a price to pay for everything.
that you see  they have created the jobs!
"Yes  yeah  but I don't know, it seems crazy to me when they've"
Well that's false economy that!
There's such  you know  sort of appalling need
"Yes, but that was the get,"
that was your get out!
"Or the  or the er  boost in the, in the economy  you know but erm"
"Yeah, but I don't think"
but I mean they were mo they were making
"Might work in our economy, but not in theirs I don't think!"
Well it hasn't!
But instead
Oh no!
of getting on with the  five years plans they've put too much effort into producing  war machines!
"Well and this is it  I mean, where we could afford it they couldn't!"
Well can we?
Look at America!
Well
"They've got greater means, I know"
"No, they, they could of they could of  afforded better than the"
Oh yeah!
you know?
Yeah.
Only just.
"So, and unfortunately erm  well"
"I mean they, they were exploiting  or they had  they had the potential exploit more countries  than Russia did."
levels off!
You was .
What's the time?
I'd better go in a minute.
"Eight o'clo ,eight o'clock."
Eight o'clock.
Five past!
Oh I've got one of them things.
Geoffrey
Oh.
"wants one, don't you Geoffrey?"
"Er  no I mean, them over there"
Mm mm.
"oh but they really get up my nose!just wanna do is phone me up, you know I I sa oh had a row with , don't say anything like  about quarter to four time  and I said to her, well I'll be quite honest   I said er  there's sixty pound a week  or seventy pound a week  I get more than you   I said I have never heard a load of moaning pratts in all my life!"
"I said you  overtime  you're moaning cos you gotta do, oh yeah  we're always"
Yeah.
"the one's that have gotta   I said and as soon as you ain't got no overtime  ooh we aren't allowed a lot this week, we're a bloody flat week da and a   I said I don't know what to do to keep you happy!"
"I said if you said to me, Geoff, I want all the overtime I can get  I can get the overtime  I'll go round and I'll try and   or if you say to me well  I don't want the overtime, I'm quite happy with a flat week  then I'll know what I am  but I said you change from day to day, one day you wannit, another day you don't!"
You
Yeah.
"just want  the job, to suit you  if you wa , if you want to go and pick your kids up from school you'd think that  oh why should we do work today, you know, let somebody else do it!"
So I said
Right.
well blow that!
I said there's a
You gotta take it when it's there ain't you?
"That's right I said, you know, I can't understand you!"
I says yo you go out to your flipping  eleven pound a week
Mummy !
Oh no!
and er he gets a thirty five pound a week child allowance on his for his four kids!
"Typical innit, though!"
Probably doesn't matter does it?
No I would have thought
The other thing might be to ring up  Borough Council  cos they've got offices in Caernarvon.
"Suppose that  that place  they might, there might be a er a parish hall there or something"
That pub would be alright wouldn't it?
Yeah.
"Okay, or"
"That would be twenty five pound a day as well, or fifty pound a day as well ."
Anyway it's a thought.
I mean if we have to
er obviously what you're saying with  it's already in use and we can't have it?
Yeah.
It's not erm  it's no good just saying oh we can have three days out of the week anyway.
No.
"You know, it's gotta be Monday to Friday or none at all hasn't it?"
Mm.
Well if it was four days it would be alright but
Mm.
anyway
Okay so they're a few options to try as regards the coding
Alright and if we can't find anyway where we'll have to   out and come back here.
Yeah.
problem as well.
"I think we, we should find somewhere."
Yeah.
Really.
Erm so that's a few options as regards the coding.
Now
Right
The interviewing  and the briefing session I think we'll probably get away with in  Debbie  's
"Yeah we're not going to, I mean we're only going to  we're, we're"
Well it's not a sort of formal interview
And I said
Didn't bother with them.
See they're alright.
"I said then  well I said from the time now, I said  there is nobody I said, can sleep on those mattresses."
"No she said, it does take a while for caravans to dry out."
Well  say what you were saying
So in other words  you don't go to the caravan.
". Let it be their responsibility, they put them in there."
"Well Mark's going in at his own risk, see?"
They sold them to you complete.
So?
So they're yours.
What's the good of a bed  a bed without a mattress?
I'm talking about the mattresses.
What are you talking about?
The caravan!
Well I thought you was talking about mattresses airing in front of the fire.
Well that subject's gone!
Oh well
"I'm saying  that  Park, what the woman said that she went down to check the vans  last summer"
Mm.
end of last summer.
long time since then .
And to see that the salt was there and the mattresses were up and that was great.
And she went down to check in the winter time and she said your van was really dry.
Oh.
Well it all depends how she checked.
perhaps.
Well then they then they went and put the mattresses back  in their places.
Now the mattresses are soaking.
Mm.
And I said there's nobody can go and sleep on those mattresses.
Mm.
"kingpin fairy, she sat on someone's head and she had this massive gown all over her, and that was really visual."
Erm
Yeah.
"he we wanted to her get off he just ran up to this erm, ladder and she just grabbed onto him, he just pulled it away."
Is that ?
Yeah.
"It's really hard, yeah."
You cannot visualize something taking place.
It's really wordy isn't it?
It's really sort of.
"And also, I mean, so many of the, the jokes just are  very"
quick jokes.
Yeah.
"They're based on maybe one word in a sentence but if you miss that, you've missed it."
And that doesn't really matter in the theatre because you carry on
Yeah.
"along by the visual gags, so neither of them when"
Yeah.
"you're reading it, you feel you've got to  you've got to follow the  follow the script."
"And the other thing about visual things, let's, let's say  there is a reference to somebody having piles, but they make it a visual gag"
Yeah.
Yeah.
whereas on the page it is  you know
Yeah.
schoolboy humour.
Yeah.
You know?
Yeah.
"Erm  I mean, nevertheless, obviously it's just somebody on the  scene is a bit"
and that free way of talking  about pain.
And wrote it like that and published it like that.
Is it Brian?
"No, this one's driving a car."
He were looking at that bus.
He might be another one of them from the er   from the council.
"Yeah, well it's, they've done nowt but look at it for last three month."
I like his registration .
Well he parked car there
Mm.
"walked up there right to your house, eyed bus up  and then walked back again."
"Yeah because what they did they  they've done it a few a times though different people, look and see how far it is before it's a blind spot."
Your Bill nearly hit it other week he were telling me.
"I dunno but like er  say the d a driver's coming this way, he wants to see how far down the road it is before it's a blind spot again."
"And if they're from the council or whatever, or whoever does the roads or whatever  they'll probably get in contact with him again."
I should imagine they are from the council.
That weren't too bad that one.
Oh
That was only a oner.
It sounded better.
have a real good do.
Wouldn't mind if I could just bloody bring it up.
And it won't?
No it won't shift.
Mm.
Bloody come up one way or the other.
Oh I could fancy a nice  horse.
I like leg.
"I don't want corned beef, that's, that, I don't want that."
I like leg.
You like leg?
Yeah.
Mm.
"I'm just debating whether to run in that kitchen and put that kettle on again, what do you reckon?"
"But like I said, it  it's just, it's gonna get moved like, no cost to you like, you know what I mean?"
It's er
Yeah.
But an advantage to them!
Is that what you mean?
"But if something went wrong then, this caravan was burnt  that's the end of it!"
They  might just take those down.
"Well i , cos the co , the insurance wouldn't cover it?"
Cos they have got these records   will have these records.
"No, you'll have a certificate then, and all, saying that the caravan covered, it'll be tested every year then."
So it isn't going to be used this week?
"But, no"
You know?
not this week.
"No, not this week."
So we shall lose our insurance?
"like that, yeah."
innit?
"See that man and woman that , yeah?"
Did you see these people in there?
What people?
A man and a woman.
There was two people sitting there.
They've just gone out.
No.
After you came.
"Well they've, they bought a  a caravan down here, a brand new one!"
Yeah.
And they bought it last summer  and they've had trouble ever since!
And they're going around asking people what !
What's up with their's then?
Well they've had to move the caravan !
I don't know  but they must of done it sometime.
"It weren't when, the other when we got all pissed?"
"No, but I mean"
Why's she think she's pregnant then?
"I mean, didn't they use anything for"
Yeah!
"But she  well she didn't, I mean she didn't tell me the intimate details or anything  I don't even know whether she has, she wo , she might have ju ge , been getting over dramatic or something!"
But she  but  her period was a week and half late  and she started well panicking!
"Yeah, well she"
"And you know , you know when we thought, yeah  well she'd, she'd just come on when she came down to my house  and she was really, really, really in a happy mood!"
"And er  you know, you know when we saw them two walking"
Yeah.
the other day?
"That was what she was upset about  she thought, oh dear,Scotty's a going to be a daddy !"
"Fucking hell,!"
I hope she hadn't done it that Saturday when we all were outside and we watching
"She might not have done it, done it  but like  she might have"
like
like  yeah.
"Cos you never know, I mean  Andrew  wipe spunk all over somebody, you know!"
"Yeah, I I should think she like  she's done some  done naughty things"
Well we all do  though
"and, yeah"
"If she's given him a blow job, I mean"
"But I mean, she's probably done something like that  and  she's just got over dramatic about it!"
Guess what  she's said she's gonna write to go on the pill!
Did she?
Well not to me !
"She did and she says, she goes, I wanna go on the pill while I've got the courage!"
But I don't think I can rely on myself to take them everyday!
"If you was there you could take them, too pissed I should think!"
Probably!
out of mahogany.
"They are nice though, they've got the Queen Anne legs and the high back you know?"
Yeah.
"He got about er two hundred for those last year, set of six."
"You know he just bought them from  sale or whatever it was, sixty, seventy quid  bit of polish."
They were  not mistaken.
"Did, he did well."
"Some of them have a lot of stuff, you know I don't seem to ever get hold of the stuff me, to  tables and that  little Eric in there he seems to get loads of stuff"
Yeah I can't
he's got a lovely table there hasn't he?it's a nice one.
"He's got a lot of connections Eric, you know and"
I have very few I'm afraid.
There you go.
Thank you.
and I think that's why we've got such a good dentist.
Mm
and he erm  he was very upset about it.
Then he  by that time this expensive  and that's the one that's .
So he said   start again.
"You're still paying out that's the trouble, all the time."
Well that's it.
"But on the other hand, what can you do about it?"
You can't
"No, no it's oh no you can't go round gummy."
"We're going to, we've, we've got this  going down to  for three weeks, you know next weekend  or the weekend afterwards, and we don't keep getting appointments, see I'm gonna keep ringing him up and pestering him and saying"
Mm
have you got a cancellation?
It's life isn't Ray?
Oh yeah.
I mean
I mean what
"friend of ours, he, he hit his tooth, got a lovely tooth  Ken he's sixty one now, never had much trouble you know"
"Oh wait, let's see what you gotta tell me today."
It's been a lovely day.
I beat you to it.
Yeah well  I couldn't so I had to come over and  and buy them a flipping new one!
"Ooh I  number again, I'll take it out in a minute."
Yeah.
Oh no
"And er she said well, I said I'm ever so sorry but she's  anyway  so I thought oh God!"
That's a step in the right direction.
Yeah.
I rang
Yep
Dee dee dee doo doo .
"You can't, you don't go through to that office at   I go further on"
Yeah.
but they are amalgam is it
Yeah
"amalgamating, with another firm so the paper work probably has got lost  So I"
"she said she was gonna ring me back, but you see I haven't been here this afternoon so I'll perhaps ring again tomorrow."
Okay.
"Well I couldn't do nothing about it really, she said well that'll be sorted out in  she said I'll treat it, we're now sorting it out today what we're doing."
Mm.
"So I said well I hope it's not gonna be too long I said cos we're not a  a very big firm  and I said, you know, we want the money!"
She said well I should imagine that's what's happened  the paper work here has got muddled up with the other.
Oh.
So she said I'll do I'll sort it out straight away for you  well I had a phone call at
"eight o'clock this morning, who the hell that was from, I don't know, I was out the washing line  I come flying in but I never got it, and nobody's rung."
.
Not unless I get a few phone calls from  been here today.
Yeah.
But you must get that portable done cos then that reaches over there I can
No it wouldn't would
"buy you diamond ring my friend if it makes you feel alright  I'd get you everything my friend if it makes you feel alright  I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love"
"ring my friend if it makes you feel alright  it's ace if you just sit down and listen to the old Beatles isn't it?feel alright  I don't care too much for money, money can't be me love can't be me love"

"everybody tells me so   oh I'm such a good singer, ha ha ha"
anyway good luck you need it I don't

If my mum finds it I'm dead.
Basically.
Basically.

that money just can't buy
I don't care too much for money money can't buy me love  love love  can't buy me love
Oh dear oh dear oh me.
It's only half  well twenty to two and I'm blooming tired.
I want to go to bed.
God you're such a lazy  have you got an envelope?
No.
Only cos then if we sent them nobody's gonna likely to spot it.
"Please, you must have an envelope somewhere."
and I've been working
You'll end up with about a dozen letters on mantel again cos I always forget to post things.
Well I'll post that tomorrow.
Well there's no rush.
"Aye you can, yeah."
"Well usually if there's not a stamp wanted, is there a stamp wanted?"
No.
"Yeah usually if there's no stamp wanted I get one of lasses while I'm at work, they'll drop it off for me."
I always say will you do me a favour and they shove it in box.
Erm  ah
?
"No, shower."
shower?
Why do you want your hair washing?
No.
I'm gonna have a proper bath later.
See you later.
"Well I says to her, I says what,do won't they have a big gap?"
But some of these tapes are funny.
Why's that?
Well you know where they're working outside all time?
And traffic.
"Traffic and all sorts, see I were talking to Joyce this morning"
Mm.
"and, I meant to listen to it but I forgot"
Oh.
"and there were buses and lorries and, quite a lot of the tapes, they've got buses and lorries and all sorts, with working outside."
With you being a lollipop lady it's bound to happen innit?
Mm.
Haven't you thought of going back to doctors?
Haven't you thought it costs three pound bloody sixty a prescription?
"Yeah, and he always writes me out a couple and I ain't got the money."
Tt.
a lot of our clients
"But on a bigger job you can, you can put the resource in can't you?"
Yeah.
"But a lot of our client's finance sections, don't see the difference between a big and a little job they see some pigeon holes in their spreadsheet and they want to put something in there."
Anything.
"And th they, they've got this sort of"
But this is where we need to talk to the client
Yes.
Of course they are.
isn't it?
"J j just agree with client he might, might be  prepared to accept on a quarterly basis"
Yeah.
you know?
I mean we don't necessarily have to give him it every month.
One could argue
Yeah.
if we're not careful we'll be causing him work.
Oh.
know what they want half of them anyway when they're
Ah.
Let us halt it there.
the customers.
Yeah.
As er I said before.
"Let us sit down, Trev, and see what is sensible"
for us to provide them with.
"Go and talk to them and say look, this is what we can provide to you."
It will be meaningful.
Is that good enough?
"And the chances are they'll say, bloody hell, that's marvellous."
Because what they're getting now is nothing.
Mm.
"No  forty pints in two  like Saturday afternoon and Saturday night, Sunday afternoon and Sunday night, he got through forty pints  or perhaps just under forty pints but that's it."
Well is he an alcoholic?
Well he's always been able to drink like that  he's .
Well he's happy enough behind all this isn't he?
Well  well I dunno.
"Well I'm, I must admit I don't know."
But I was   the trouble
What?
is
He's rotting his stomach isn't he?
"yeah I mean, and the trouble is  what  n annoys me more than anything  is the fact that he's good worker  I me even when he's drunk, alright he don't work at full capacity  but he does sort of almost as much as what they do  and when he's"
Yeah.
"sober  he can do more than they do  I mean i that ain't the sort bloke you wanna lose, and I'm, when he balls and shouts at them  well he gets on your nerves really  but at the end of the day I'll  you know, I'll put up with it."
"You can put up with that, good God!"
"Yeah because he's a, he's a bloody good worker but  and when he's like  Cor!"
And the other morning  disgrace!
"The funny thing is, like  there's a beer smell isn't there?"
Yeah.
"But he has got the sort of  acidy sort of alcohol smell on his breath  just like you'd been on  spirits all night  or whatever, any sort of  you know, wine and  it's not a beer sort of smell."
"But I mean he's  I mean Ivan said to me, phworgh, he said when Cliff's breathing over you!"
"I said I know I said, just like neat alcohol innit?"
God he said!
Well I should think  that's   acidity in his stomach innit?
"Definitely  and he'll say I've got this pain, I've got this pain, I should think you have Cliff!"
"Oh it's not that, no it's not."
Where's he get the pain?
In his side.
In his side?
"I think he's rotting his liver, that's the feeling."
"Liver, yeah , exactly."
But you see he's that thick
.
Yeah.
ten p or twenty p.
"Oh that that would be a different ball game, selling it in places wouldn't it?"
Oh yeah.
Ho how many
"That's our, I mean, you know you can go round in newsagents or doctor's surgery and dump them."
But to actually say right can you s can you collect the money for us!
Well one could put a  box next to it.
"Well in some places, yeah ."
"Yeah but I mean, mm."
a copy's a lot.
"It is, yeah."
Well although
I mean it I'm not suggesting that isn't cheap but erm  to produce at five p a copy
Oh yeah.
thousand it's gonna cost what's it gonna cost?
Er.
What's five thousands?
Five thousands.
Fifty pounds.
Mm.
Mm.
"I mean I'm, I'm, I'm only going on the fact that I I tend to do everything on the cheap so I tend to get  if I can find somebody who does photocopying I can  do it then we'll do it."
"For me to produce that'll cost me  basically  my time and my  my you know I, say my laser copies' paid for by my business  erm"
copies.
"So I mean if I, if I produced for instance si five or six masters  and then people can go and do copies here and there that's actually not a bad way of doing it."
"And that'll be, I've got about a ream of, well it's only about a ream  paper."
Just pr producing new copies as you need them rather than produce five thousand and I think we we have sort of hundreds to throw away in the end.
But I  it to to er  recycling.
Yeah.
Well I'll get in touch with this  East Herts guy to get all his information.
Good.
Do they still do it?
the P E teacher is supposedly collecting aluminium cans and  we've been through various daft schemes of stopping the children from throwing the cans everywhere because we've got this coke machine.
And we even had one where they paid a ten p deposit  on a can so they paid forty p instead of thirty or whatever.
And I got hardly any cans back.
Or they did was b buy them from the school canteen where they were still thirty!
And the coke machine wasn't used.
Well why not er encourage the canteen to charge forty
They didn't  but then they had
as well?
"Well, they won't because they they they have to make money in order to survive."
The more money they make the better for them.
They have to run it as a business now.
For profit I'm afraid.
Er oh I did have one Polish lad who's now left who used to go round looking for all the cans and he'd  then collect the ten p's!
scheme folded.
Through lack of support.
So what else is mentioned here?
I think that  still holds.
"And I can check, I will go and ."
And car batteries is the same.
Other batteries I'll check.
Pills er  you check
Yeah.
.
Furniture erm  yeah I think that's.
Is there a second hand furniture shop now in Bishop's Stortford?
There is one isn't there?
Is there one down by the Causeway?
Yes there is.
Who is going to check that?
Well I can check it.
Yeah.
The speed is increasing.
Sort of
Stop.
"sort of actually stops, and then it's going very slowly again for a bit, and then what happens here?"
"very, it just goes very fast"
Right.
"in a very short space of time then, but then carries on."
Very short space of time it's gone quite a distance.
"So that was a, that is at, that constant speed there is much faster than, than this one."
"And then, it's stationary"
It's
for a while.
And then
Just goes down there.
What's happening here?
Deceleration.
"Well let's make, let's make this bit a straight line, from there to about there."
That's a straight line.
"So, well let's go back to the physics."
We've just been going on timing it for one minute or something.
"And we time it again, one minute and one second"
It's reversed.
It's reversed.
How far away was it when I started the watch?
Thirty metres away.
"How, how far is it after another one second?"
Twenty metres away.
Ah.
Ah!
It's coming back.
Okay.
So that's going backwards.
Sing Don't be cruel .
I'm not singing at all.
Why not?
Because I can't sing.
Oh hang on the ex-directory number's ringing.
That's the boss he'll be complaining.
So there's no chance of getting rid of all these coaches and getting people to walk round the er the guided tours and stuff like that?
Er well that would defeat the whole object of offering the open topped tours if people were actually walking.
Well it would defeat you making a few bob .
There is actually there is actually walking tours around the city for those people who wish to opt for
Mm.
for a walking tour.
So there is the option of doing both the walking tour or the bus tour.
Okay hang on just a minute.
Er Danny?
He's the bo he's what they call the editor of the programme.
Right.
Okay just in case you're wondering who I'm talking t Danny anything else you want me to ask her?
He cos he are you sure we've done this erm everything all right?
Okay right sing along with me Rachael.
Are you ready?
I'm not singing.
You're not singing.
You're not singing?
No.

"Yes, I'd whack him on the head with me stick or something."

"Haven't seen Dan in there for a long time, I thought he'd left Lionel and gone off to get a  a highly lucrative job somewhere  You don't somehow expect to see a, a young man with a university degree working in your local green grocer do you?"
"Mm, what's his degree in?"
"I haven't asked him, I didn't like to."
"They must have been high up in the tree,leaves."

But Birmingham must have won today cos they had equal top  must have won I would have thought.

They did very well with those little tulip hand out  things didn't they?
"There's a lot of people who er don't, who would not have gone to the bother of going into the shop and buying a one pound or two pound or four pound"
But why did they do well out of them if they were free?
Well yeah they're free but they've got their advert on it haven't they?
Tulip

Oh my goodness.
On his left ear.
"He's nice though isn't he, wasn't he, he did say something"
Yeah.

"I'm sure, she said it's blue."
It's got some cream in it as well ain't it.
"Well,more, so I couldn't see, but I just, to me it was just like er, thought it was like minky coloured."
"But mind ya,more like a, but what I was gonna say is,"
Suppose to be a  but I mean
"On back of it, on back of it, she's got like all them tapestry pictures laid over back of it."
Yeah.
"She got, same on chairs, all, you can hardly see the suite, 'cos she's got, she says, and er, I says to her, I says to her, oh it's nice your suite, innit."
"She says yeah, if I can keep it clean, she got all cushions covered up, well like er, er"
"Keep it clean, there's only them two buggers."
"I know, but what's the point of having a new suite, and having old covers on it like that."
"They make me laugh, when they sit in 'ouse with blanket round them, so they don't have to turn 'eating up."
I don't
"Aye, you go in there and it's empty that other"
That's empty.
"I know, I see it."
"I tell you what, you  to make mistakes in your life, I mean and, I just, well one of those things that  that I'm pleased about, is that I just  George when"
Don't work.
Aye.
When what?
When I stopped with Colin.
Oh well.
"You don't know how green, how green the grass is until you actually stand"
You can't go till your dad comes.
"Why, I'm going home all by myself, then."
"Well, get off there."

We do
You'll end up with a smack bum.
"Benjy, will you leave her alone."
Are you  have you told her to leave me alone?
"And this bit I do before the lesson and I do this, clean it up afterwards."
You don't have to do this bit.
"But notice that I'm pouring slowly and gently away from me into the dish which I shall then put in here, and I'm going to put the  the plate, which I described to you before, which has been covered with  what's on the back?"
Straw hat varnish.
What's on the front?
Hard wax.
Hard wax.
And scratched so the acid should bite through there.
Has anybody got a chronometer on them?
What?
you have haven't you?
What?
A watch.
Will you time er  two minutes please?
From the moment this goes into the acid.
You lower it in gently and sloosh it about so that the acid covers the surface.
"Right, you may troop by that and look down there, notice I wasn't wearing the goggles that was naughty of me wasn't it?"
I should have been  er while I go and get a turkey feather.
"Okay, you go and have a look at that covered up."
And try and see if we've got er   forming on the lines.
yes.
"That's what makes er these chemicals so dangerous, you don't know what they are."
What do you think I've got this for?
"Sorry, I can't hear you Paul."
So that er
I still can't hear you.
To scrape the zinc off.
To scrape the zinc off?
When it's ?
"Very good, yes."
That's correct.
As the zinc is eaten away  air bubbl er sorry not air bubbles  gas bubbles  I don't know what gas.
Who's A T S?
Tyres and .
"You don't owe them nothing do you, I hope?"
"Nothing to do with A T S, don't like them."
Precisely for that reason I should think!
"Well wha what he said was  he went up there  there's erm  could they  put on the front wheels  to the back  and the back wheels to the front  didn't say anything  the bloke said, well we can't charge you."
Oh.
And the bloke said well we can't charge you for that.
So this is isn't what it's all about?
"Well, that's how it all come  see he owes them a hundred and seven pound  and er"
when he asked them change the tyres over they wouldn't do it.
Oh.
Yeah but they said we can't charge you for it  he said we sell a new tube or sell you a new tyre he said  we can charge you  but we can't charge you labour.
That's ridiculous innit?
"Yeah, so he said well  charge me for wheel balancing then or something  no he said, we can't do that."
He's just being awkward by the sound of it.
So he said will you do it for nothing?
And he said it's not a charity case!
Could you pay him to do it?
He says no.
Said fair enough  he said and with that I come out the garage.
"Well why don't he use that bloke at St. Johns, who you use?"
He does now.
So erm  he's phoned up me   your money  cos he said they daren't put me in court you see.
Well that's a ridiculous  thing to do!
"Well they say they're gonna put you into court, you get it paid don't you, before anything goes further?"
Yeah  yeah well you see what he said was  he could not see how they could warrant   him  that sixty odd come as interest   justify doing it.
It will all depend how long has he owed them it.
Possibly about a year I think.
Cor!
My God!
"So he said, I'm not having that!"
"Imagine what it'd be like, when it's really cold."
"And I thought to myself, oh gosh, just drive up there,"
Yeah.
it's only a ten minute drive.
Yeah.
I picked the right time.
"See that's the thing, if I wanna go and do my studying, I can't just go, I have to  and, and dinner starts at erm, if I've got a lecture, my lecture is sort of one o'clock."
Just before one o'clock and the bus goes at five past one.
So I haven't got time to get any dinner.
No.
See what I mean?
"Well, what about"
No.
"So I have to get a bit, er jump on the bus, and then erm, either get something to eat at their college, but then, by that time, you see, cos dinner starts at quarter to twelve, it's all gone."
"And we went there last time, and all they had left was chips and this fatty stew."
"Er, that's"
And that's it.
"No veggies or nothing, no salad."
No veggies
No.
Oh dear
"So, it's, alright it's not a major problem, but that's the only difficulty with it is it's not, it's good having the bus service where you don't have to pay, right, if you don't, like I didn't realize the bus went at five past one, and I was all ready to go, and er, it was ten past one, and I thought, oh no, so I had to wait till three o'clock."
Do some work.
That's a bit silly really.
"Yeah, and then the next bus from six o'clock, is eight o'clock."
And that's the last bus home.
You would have thought these buses would
"It's only a ten minute, it's about a ten minute journey from Digby to Southlands."
Fifteen to Southlands to Whiteland.
"It's all round in a circle, it's not like then, I don't know why."
How peculiar.
"Yeah, it is a bit of a pain."
"you can't tell him nothing  he would say  oh no no no, beer's no problem, beer's no problem no  it's not that experience, not that experience, I said well you wanna smell yourself Cliff!"
Cor God!
Well I still   alcohol.
it does.
Yeah alcohol
And your guess is that  he said er  bought something
Guinness is a heavy drink!
Yeah he's
That's surprising he don't have such a bad head!
No he said er
Ah  Cor!
Well fancy being a like that all that time  it's bad enough when you've been out on a binge and you get that headache then.
"Chris  Ivan said to me, he said  Cliff wanted us to go and have a drink he said when we've finished work on a Friday  he said last night, I tell you, I said   I said no, no I didn't!"
Well how are you all gonna get home?
"Oh yeah he don't mean that he had a lot of drink, just have a drink and come home."
I said well I hope you enjoy .
"Well it isn't worth it, you can't afford to drink and drive can you?"
I know.
"Mel's got her lights up, did you see them?"
Yeah well   yeah.
"Mm  yeah talking about that now he's out the way  basically what he was gonna say was, as simple as this"
.
well it don't matter does it?
Oh alright then.
Yeah  no he was just saying that head office  they'll dictate to them like anybody else  so he said  I've got to have  erm  the mortgage up to date for a start before I can consider anything.
"I thought you'd done that, you was gonna do that?"
"Yeah but I haven't  that's what he saying, but he said what I wouldn't do is ju , don't just say right phrum  there's"
What do you mean?
"there's a thousand pound he said, you know, if you can make it right  sort of over the next month  but he said basically I cannot do anything until  erm  the end of February, he said you come in the end of February he said and then we can start to sort it out, he said I can't do anything for you until then."
Did you tell him that?
Who?
Malcolm.
So you've got  nine  plus four  Did we do a sample all day?
"No, just in the peak hours they're sampling."
Didn't we do them off peak as well?
We should have done them off peak as well shouldn't we?
I don't know.
I mean Jan did those.
I think it was just peak hours.
Er   It's gonna take thirteen people isn't it?
"Yeah, I mean if it was peaks only I mean there's nothing to stop me doing it."
Well I appreciate that.
"Or you use it, you put everybody on in the peaks"
Yeah.
"and then you, you"
You use the
cutback
"In the off, in the off peak they rotate the staff and"
I'm not The thing is what you're assuming then is that the pattern in the peak hour  is typical for the day as a whole.
That's not right is it?
Mm  maybe not.
Well you'll get a different pattern in the morning peak and the evening peak for a start won't you?
Mhm.
Mind you maybe you won't.
"Depends, what you're really concerned about is how does the proportion of traffic  split to left and right and  straight ahead isn't it?"
"If that pattern basically stays the same  then you've got, the volume, the flow will go up and down."
Mm right.
But if we did a full turning count how would we do that?
You can't do it can you?
It's not realistic.
You have to do  if you're doing that you have to have all the ins and outs plus a circulation flow.
Yeah.
And I've never done one like that.
"We've always  you know, found a way round it."
Yeah.
"I said do you, do you think there'd be any discount  er with it being a block booking?"
"And she didn't say no full stop, she said oh she said I'm not sure she said, I'd have to enquire about that."
"So  I just thought she's gonna  yeah if it was out of the question she could have said oh no that's it, there's a flat rate so I"
Yeah.
think she's gonna ask
thing is with them Welshies they probably haven't tried to bloody  they haven't got the sense.
No.
"If somebody else was trying to book it, one of those Welshy types, they haven't got the sense to  ask"
"No, I said well I said that  I'd appreciate it cos it's worth a go and she said oh yes I agree with you there."
Which field's Min in?
Not any of these.
So that was good.
Ooh  I can't stop yawning.
"So then I thought oh I'll go and find  er the  offices again, Church Street."
"And we'd gone a roundabout way the last time we were there and I thought oh I'll give it a go, anyway I walked straight down this road, have a look oh yes, turn up here  anyway I, I sort of got me bearings and I thought oh yes it's just down here  he's in the field just down there."
Is he?
Do you wanna go or not or go straight to your nan's?
"Go straight to nan's, call on the way back."
If it isn't too late.
Couldn't see him.
"Erm  so I went straight to this place and there was a fella downstairs, his secretary was  erm out on her lunch."
"Anyway I said oh  I said you're not expecting me, said who I was and where I was from."
"I said I called in to see either Michael or the secretary, Mirelda her name is."
Mm.
And er so he said alright.
"I said I'm also gonna be che cheeky and see if I can use your toi he said oh yes he said, go and help yourself he said there's a kettle down there, make yourself a drink, make yourself at home."
So anyway I thought I won't have a drink cos if  this secretary wasn't there I didn't know how long she'd be  so er but I di I went upstairs to where we had the meeting with Mike the other week.
And erm  Joe his partner was there so I had a really good chat to him.
What do you mean his partner like?
Is it just like a little firm?
And this Michael's one of the partners in the firm?
don't we?
Well we wanna know whether we were gonna try and do them all in that week?
Twenty seventh of April.
Monday Tuesday Thursday.
I think the plan that goes to  to the police  thank you  needs to show the i interview sites on it.
"You remember we had, on the Ormskirk one we did one that had a study area on it?"
Yeah.
But we also had one  that showed the individual locations.
Yeah.
And I think that was the one that went to the police.
Right.
"Er and the fire brigade and, and so on."
Yeah cos they'll want to know.
Well that's it.
Yeah.
"And all you're doing is warning them that they will, the things will be there and we'll make sure that if a  emergency vehicle comes along  erm"
But they will know your precise dates won't they?
Well they'll want to know precise dates.
I can't remember that we did actually.
"No I don't know whether we do give them, even  the precise dates."
"It isn't really much use then is it, just giving them  a rough ?"
Well it's only a warning.
"Well we'll have a look back in, I'll have a look back in the file and see what we did last time."
"Erm  Do you wanna do that, have a look at what we'd said in Ormskirk"
Yeah.
on that side of things?
Yeah.
I think I wrote to them if I remember rightly.
Well I didn't.
Erm  now we need to do something about layout plans.
So we need to get some  if we're going to work on ordnance survey ones we'll need to sort something on that.
Have to have a chat with   Anyway you're not in an immediate rush to do that are you?
The next Saturday Anne and Diana started out .
"They drove to the end of the road and canvassed homeward , calling first on the `` Andrew girls . ''"
"`` If Catherine is alone we may get something , '' said Diana , `` but if Eliza is there we wo n't . ''"
Eliza was there ... very much so ... and looked even grimmer than usual .
"Miss Eliza was one of those people who give you the impression that life is indeed a vale of tears , and that a smile , never to speak of a laugh , is a waste of nervous energy truly reprehensible ."
The Andrew girls had been `` girls '' for fifty odd years and seemed likely to remain girls to the end of their earthly pilgrimage .
"Catherine , it was said , had not entirely given up hope , but Eliza , who was born a pessimist , had never had any ."
They lived in a little brown house built in a sunny corner scooped out of Mark Andrew 's beech woods .
"Eliza complained that it was terrible hot in summer , but Catherine was wont to say it was lovely and warm in winter ."
"Eliza was sewing patchwork , not because it was needed but simply as a protest against the frivolous lace Catherine was crocheting ."
"Eliza listened with a frown and Catherine with a smile , as the girls explained their errand ."
"To be sure , whenever Catherine caught Eliza 's eye she discarded the smile in guilty confusion ; but it crept back the next moment ."
"`` If I had money to waste , '' said Eliza grimly , `` I 'd burn it up and have the fun of seeing a blaze maybe ; but I would n't give it to that hall , not a cent ."
It 's no benefit to the settlement ... just a place for young folks to meet and carry on when they 's better be home in their beds . ''
"`` Oh , Eliza , young folks must have some amusement , '' protested Catherine ."
`` I do n't see the necessity .
"We did n't gad about to halls and places when we were young , Catherine Andrews ."
This world is getting worse every day . ''
"`` I think it 's getting better , '' said Catherine firmly ."
`` YOU think ! ''
Miss Eliza 's voice expressed the utmost contempt .
"`` It does n't signify what you THINK , Catherine Andrews ."
Facts is facts . ''
"`` Well , I always like to look on the bright side , Eliza . ''"
`` There is n't any bright side . ''
"`` Oh , indeed there is , '' cried Anne , who could n't endure such heresy in silence ."
"`` Why , there are ever so many bright sides , Miss Andrews ."
It 's really a beautiful world . ''
"`` You wo n't have such a high opinion of it when you 've lived as long in it as I have , '' retorted Miss Eliza sourly , `` and you wo n't be so enthusiastic about improving it either ."
"How is your mother , Diana ?"
"Dear me , but she has failed of late ."
She looks terrible run down .
"`` Wake me up when she comes , '' said rob , and was fast asleep in five minutes with his head in Nan 's lap under the pinafore ."
"The little girl sat for some fifteen minutes , staring about her with anxious eyes , and feeling as if each second was an hour ."
"Then a pale light began to glimmer over the hill-top and she said to herself , `` I guess the night is over and morning is coming ."
"I 'd like to see the sun rise , so I 'll watch , and when it comes up we can find our way right home . ''"
"But before the moon 's round face peeped above the hill to destroy her hope , Nan had fallen asleep , leaning back in a little bower of tall ferns , and was deep in a mid-summer night 's dream of fire-flies and blue aprons , mountains of huckleberries , and Robby wiping away the tears of a black cow , who sobbed , `` I want to go home !"
I want to go home ! ''
"While the children were sleeping , peacefully lulled by the drowsy hum of many neighborly mosquitoes , the family at home were in a great state of agitation ."
"The hay-cart came at five , and all but Jack , Emil , Nan , and Rob were at the bars ready for it ."
"Franz drove instead of Silas , and when the boys told him that the others were going home through the wood , he said , looking ill-pleased , `` They ought to have left Rob to ride , he will be tired out by the long walk . ''"
"`` It 's shorter that way , and they will carry him , '' said Stuffy , who was in a hurry for his supper ."
`` You are sure Nan and Rob went with them ? ''
"`` Of course they did ; I saw them getting over the wall , and sung out that it was most five , and Jack called back that they were going the other way , '' explained Tommy ."
"`` Very well , pile in then , '' and away rattled the hay-cart with the tired children and the full pails ."
"Mrs. Jo looked sober when she heard of the division of the party , and sent Franz back with Toby to find and bring the little ones home ."
"Supper was over , and the family sitting about in the cool hall as usual , when Franz came trotting back , hot , dusty , and anxious ."
`` Have they come ? ''
he called out when half-way up the avenue .
`` No ! ''
and Mrs. Jo flew out of her chair looking so alarmed that every one jumped up and gathered round Franz .
"`` I ca n't find them anywhere , '' he began ; but the words were hardly spoken when a loud `` Hullo ! ''"
"startled them all , and the next minute Jack and Emil came round the house ."
`` Where are Nan and Rob ? ''
"cried Mrs. Jo , clutching Emil in a way that caused him to think his aunt had suddenly lost her wits ."
`` I do n't know .
"They came home with the others , did n't they ? ''"
"he answered , quickly ."
`` No ; George and Tommy said they went with you . ''
"`` Well , they did n't ."
Have n't seen them .
"We took a swim in the pond , and came by the wood , '' said Jack , looking alarmed , as well he might ."
"`` Call Mr. Bhaer , get the lanterns , and tell Silas I want him . ''"
"That was all Mrs. Jo said , but they knew what she meant , and flew to obey her orders ."
`` My name is Maxwell Seeley .
"My father died when I was seven years old , and my mother a year later ."
"My little sister , Bertha , then three years old , and I were left quite alone and very poor ."
We had no relatives .
"I was adopted by a well-to-do old bachelor , who had known my father ."
My sister was taken to an orphan asylum in a city some distance away .
I was very much attached to her and grieved bitterly over our parting .
My adopted father was very kind to me and gave me a good education .
"I did not forget my sister , and as soon as I could I went to the asylum ."
"I found that she had been taken away long before , and I could not even discover who had adopted her , for the original building , with all its records , had been destroyed by fire two years previous to my visit ."
"I never could find any clue to her whereabouts , and long since gave up all hope of finding her ."
But I have found her at last .
"You are Bertha Seeley , my little sister ! ''"
`` Oh -- can it be possible ! ''
`` More than possible -- it is certain .
"You are the image of my mother , as I remember her , and as an old daguerreotype I have pictures her ."
"And this is her watch -- see , I scratched my own initials on the case one day ."
There is no doubt in the world .
"Oh , Bertha , are you half as glad as I am ? ''"
`` Glad ! ''
Bertha 's eyes were shining like stars .
"She tried to smile , but burst into tears instead and her head went down on her brother 's shoulder ."
"By this time everybody in the room was staring at the extraordinary tableau , and Ernest , coming through the hall , gave a whistle of astonishment that brought the two in the corner back to a sense of their surroundings ."
"`` I have n't suddenly gone crazy , Ernest , old fellow , '' smiled Max ."
"`` Ladies and gentlemen all , this little school-ma ` am was introduced to you as Miss Price , but that was a mistake ."
"Let me introduce her again as Miss Bertha Seeley , my long-lost and newly-found sister . ''"
"Well they had an amazing time then , of course ."
They laughed and questioned and explained until the dinner was in imminent danger of getting stone-cold on the dining-room table .
"Luckily , Alma and Frances remembered it just in the nick of time , and they all got out , somehow , and into their places ."
"It was a splendid dinner , but I believe that Maxwell and Bertha Seeley did n't know what they were eating , any more than if it had been sawdust ."
"However , the rest of the guests made up for that , and did full justice to the girls ' cookery ."
"In the afternoon they all went to church , and at least two hearts were truly and devoutly thankful that day ."
"I do n't mind ; I ai n't a little girl , I 'm older than you and Daisy ; so now , '' cried Nan , ungratefully ."
"`` Do n't preach , Deacon , you bully Posy every day of your life , '' called out the Commodore , who just then hove in sight ."
"`` I do n't hurt her ; do I , Daisy ? ''"
"and Demi turned to his sister , who was `` pooring '' Nan 's tingling hands , and recommending water for the purple lump rapidly developing itself on her forehead ."
"`` You are the best boy in the world , '' promptly answered Daisy ; adding , as truth compelled her to do , `` You hurt me sometimes , but you do n't mean to . ''"
"`` Put away the bats and things , and mind what you are about , my hearties ."
"No fighting allowed aboard this ship , '' said Emil , who rather lorded it over the others ."
"`` How do you do , Madge Wildfire ? ''"
"said Mr. Bhaer , as Nan came in with the rest to supper ."
"`` Give the right hand , little daughter , and mind thy manners , '' he added , as Nan offered him her left ."
`` The other hurts me . ''
`` The poor little hand !
what has it been doing to get those blisters ? ''
"he asked , drawing it from behind her back , where she had put it with a look which made him think she had been in mischief ."
"Before Nan could think of any excuse , Daisy burst out with the whole story , during which Stuffy tried to hide his face in a bowl of bread and milk ."
"When the tale was finished , Mr. Bhaer looked down the long table towards his wife , and said with a laugh in his eyes , `` This rather belongs to your side of the house , so I wo n't meddle with it , my dear . ''"
"Mrs. Jo knew what he meant , but she liked her little black sheep all the better for her pluck , though she only said in her soberest way , `` Do you know why I asked Nan to come here ? ''"
"`` To plague me , '' muttered Stuffy , with his mouth full ."
"`` To help make little gentlemen of you , and I think you have shown that some of you need it . ''"
"Here Stuffy retired into his bowl again , and did not emerge till Demi made them all laugh by saying , in his slow wondering way , `` How can she , when she 's such a tomboy ? ''"
"`` That 's just it , she needs help as much as you , and I expect you set her an example of good manners . ''"
`` Is she going to be a little gentleman too ? ''
asked Rob .
"`` She 'd like it ; would n't you , Nan ? ''"
added Tommy .
"`` No , I should n't ; I hate boys ! ''"
"said Nan fiercely , for her hand still smarted , and she began to think that she might have shown her courage in some wiser way ."
"`` I am sorry you hate my boys , because they can be well-mannered , and most agreeable when they choose ."
"Kindness in looks and words and ways is true politeness , and any one can have it if they only try to treat other people as they like to be treated themselves . ''"
"Mrs. Bhaer had addressed herself to Nan , but the boys nudged one another , and appeared to take the hint , for that time at least , and passed the butter ; said `` please , '' and `` thank you , '' `` yes , sir , '' and `` no , ma'am , '' with unusual elegance and respect ."
"Nan said nothing , but kept herself quiet and refrained from tickling Demi , though strongly tempted to do so , because of the dignified airs he put on ."
"She also appeared to have forgotten her hatred of boys , and played `` I spy '' with them till dark ."
"Daisy heard it , ran in , saw the empty dish , also the end of a yellow tail disappearing under the bed ."
"Without a word she seized that tail , pulled out the thief , and shook him till his ears flapped wildly , then bundled him down-stairs to the shed , where he spent a lonely evening in the coal-bin ."
"Cheered by the sympathy which Demi gave her , Daisy made another bowlful of batter , and fried a dozen cakes , which were even better than the others ."
"Indeed , Uncle Fritz after eating two sent up word that he had never tasted any so nice , and every boy at the table below envied Demi at the flapjack party above ."
"It was a truly delightful supper , for the little teapot lid only fell off three times and the milk jug upset but once ; the cakes floated in syrup , and the toast had a delicious beef-steak flavor , owing to cook 's using the gridiron to make it on ."
"Demi forgot philosophy , and stuffed like any carnal boy , while Daisy planned sumptuous banquets , and the dolls looked on smiling affably ."
"`` Well , dearies , have you had a good time ? ''"
"asked Mrs. Jo , coming up with Teddy on her shoulder ."
`` A very good time .
"I shall come again soon , '' answered Demi , with emphasis ."
"`` I 'm afraid you have eaten too much , by the look of that table . ''"
"`` No , I have n't ; I only ate fifteen cakes , and they were very little ones , '' protested Demi , who had kept his sister busy supplying his plate ."
"`` They wo n't hurt him , they are so nice , '' said Daisy , with such a funny mixture of maternal fondness and housewifely pride that Aunt Jo could only smile and say : `` Well , on the whole , the new game is a success then ? ''"
"`` I like it , '' said Demi , as if his approval was all that was necessary ."
`` It is the dearest play ever made ! ''
"cried Daisy , hugging her little dish-tub as she proposed to wash up the cups ."
"`` I just wish everybody had a sweet cooking stove like mine , '' she added , regarding it with affection ."
"`` This play out to have a name , '' said Demi , gravely removing the syrup from his countenance with his tongue ."
`` It has . ''
"`` Oh , what ? ''"
asked both children eagerly .
"`` Well , I think we will call it Pattypans , '' and Aunt Jo retired , satisfied with the success of her last trap to catch a sunbeam ."
CHAPTER VI .
"A FIRE BRAND `` Please , ma'am , could I speak to you ?"
"It is something very important , '' said Nat , popping his head in at the door of Mrs. Bhaer 's room ."
"It was the fifth head which had popped in during the last half-hour ; but Mrs. Jo was used to it , so she looked up , and said , briskly , `` What is it , my lad ? ''"
"Nat came in , shut the door carefully behind him , and said in an eager , anxious tone , `` Dan has come . ''"
`` Who is Dan ? ''
`` He 's a boy I used to know when I fiddled round the streets .
"He sold papers , and he was kind to me , and I saw him the other day in town , and told him how nice it was here , and he 's come . ''"
"`` But , my dear boy , that is rather a sudden way to pay a visit . ''"
"`` Oh , it is n't a visit ; he wants to stay if you will let him ! ''"
Rilla 's fear lifted .
Dog Monday howled no more and resumed his routine of train meeting and watching .
When five days had passed the Ingleside people began to feel that they might be cheerful again .
"Rilla dashed about the kitchen helping Susan with the breakfast and singing so sweetly and clearly that Cousin Sophia across the road heard her and croaked out to Mrs. Albert , '' ` Sing before eating , cry before sleeping , ' I 've always heard . ''"
But Rilla Blythe shed no tears before the nightfall .
"When her father , his face grey and drawn and old , came to her that afternoon and told her that Walter had been killed in action at Courcelette she crumpled up in a pitiful little heap of merciful unconsciousness in his arms ."
Nor did she waken to her pain for many hours .
"CHAPTER XXIII `` AND SO , GOODNIGHT '' The fierce flame of agony had burned itself out and the grey dust of its ashes was over all the world ."
Rilla 's younger life recovered physically sooner than her mother .
For weeks Mrs. Blythe lay ill from grief and shock .
"Rilla found it was possible to go on with existence , since existence had still to be reckoned with ."
"There was work to be done , for Susan could not do all ."
"For her mother 's sake she had to put on calmness and endurance as a garment in the day ; but night after night she lay in her bed , weeping the bitter rebellious tears of youth until at last tears were all wept out and the little patient ache that was to be in her heart until she died took their place ."
"She clung to Miss Oliver , who knew what to say and what not to say ."
So few people did .
"Kind , well-meaning callers and comforters gave Rilla some terrible moments ."
"`` You 'll get over it in time , '' Mrs. William Reese said , cheerfully ."
"Mrs. Reese had three stalwart sons , not one of whom had gone to the front ."
"`` It 's such a blessing it was Walter who was taken and not Jem , '' said Miss Sarah Clow ."
"`` Walter was a member of the church , and Jem was n't ."
I 've told Mr. Meredith many a time that he should have spoken seriously to Jem about it before he went away . ''
"`` Pore , pore Walter , '' sighed Mrs. Reese ."
"`` Do not you come here calling him poor Walter , '' said Susan indignantly , appearing in the kitchen door , much to the relief of Rilla , who felt that she could endure no more just then ."
`` He was not poor .
He was richer than any of you .
"It is you who stay at home and will not let your sons go who are poor -- poor and naked and mean and small -- pisen poor , and so are your sons , with all their prosperous farms and fat cattle and their souls no bigger than a flea 's -- if as big . ''"
"`` I came here to comfort the afflicted and not to be insulted , '' said Mrs. Reese , taking her departure , unregretted by anyone ."
"Then the fire went out of Susan and she retreated to her kitchen , laid her faithful old head on the table and wept bitterly for a time ."
Then she went to work and ironed Jims 's little rompers .
Rilla scolded her gently for it when she herself came in to do it .
"`` I am not going to have you kill yourself working for any war-baby , '' Susan said obstinately ."
"`` Oh , I wish I could just keep on working all the time , Susan , '' cried poor Rilla ."
`` Will you please wipe your feet carefully on the grass and then walk on these papers ? ''
she said anxiously .
`` I 've just swept the house all over and I ca n't have any more dust tracked in .
The path 's been real muddy since the rain yesterday . ''
"`` Do n't you dare laugh , '' warned Anne in a whisper , as they marched along the newspapers ."
"`` And I implore you , Diana , not to look at me , no matter what she says , or I shall not be able to keep a sober face . ''"
"The papers extended across the hall and into a prim , fleckless parlor ."
Anne and Diana sat down gingerly on the nearest chairs and explained their errand .
"Mrs. White heard them politely , interrupting only twice , once to chase out an adventurous fly , and once to pick up a tiny wisp of grass that had fallen on the carpet from Anne 's dress ."
"Anne felt wretchedly guilty ; but Mrs. White subscribed two dollars and paid the money down ... `` to prevent us from having to go back for it , '' Diana said when they got away ."
Mrs. White had the newspapers gathered up before they had their horse untied and as they drove out of the yard they saw her busily wielding a broom in the hall .
"`` I 've always heard that Mrs. Theodore White was the neatest woman alive and I 'll believe it after this , '' said Diana , giving way to her suppressed laughter as soon as it was safe ."
"`` I am glad she has no children , '' said Anne solemnly ."
`` It would be dreadful beyond words for them if she had . ''
At the Spencers ' Mrs. Isabella Spencer made them miserable by saying something ill-natured about everyone in Avonlea .
"Mr. Thomas Boulter refused to give anything because the hall , when it had been built , twenty years before , had n't been built on the site he recommended ."
"Mrs. Esther Bell , who was the picture of health , took half an hour to detail all her aches and pains , and sadly put down fifty cents because she would n't be there that time next year to do it ... no , she would be in her grave ."
"Their worst reception , however , was at Simon Fletcher 's ."
When they drove into the yard they saw two faces peering at them through the porch window .
But although they rapped and waited patiently and persistently nobody came to the door .
Two decidedly ruffled and indignant girls drove away from Simon Fletcher 's .
Even Anne admitted that she was beginning to feel discouraged .
But the tide turned after that .
"Several Sloane homesteads came next , where they got liberal subscriptions , and from that to the end they fared well , with only an occasional snub ."
Their last place of call was at Robert Dickson 's by the pond bridge .
"They stayed to tea here , although they were nearly home , rather than risk offending Mrs. Dickson , who had the reputation of being a very `` touchy '' woman ."
While they were there old Mrs. James White called in .
"`` I 've just been down to Lorenzo 's , '' she announced ."
`` He 's the proudest man in Avonlea this minute .
What do you think ?
"There 's a brand new boy there ... and after seven girls that 's quite an event , I can tell you . ''"
"Anne pricked up her ears , and when they drove away she said ."
But you look more like your great grandfather West than the MacAllisters .
He died of a paralytic stroke quite early in life . ''
`` Did you see anybody at the store ? ''
"asked Rilla desperately , in the faint hope of directing Susan 's conversation into more agreeable channels ."
"`` Nobody except Mary Vance , '' said Susan , `` and she was stepping round as brisk as the Irishman 's flea . ''"
What terrible similes Susan used !
Would Kenneth think she acquired them from the family !
"`` To hear Mary talk about Miller Douglas you would think he was the only Glen boy who had enlisted , '' Susan went on ."
"`` But of course she always did brag and she has some good qualities I am willing to admit , though I did not think so that time she chased Rilla here through the village with a dried codfish till the poor child fell , heels over head , into the puddle before Carter Flagg 's store . ''"
Rilla went cold all over with wrath and shame .
Were there any more disgraceful scenes in her past that Susan could rake up ?
"As for Ken , he could have howled over Susan 's speeches , but he would not so insult the duenna of his lady , so he sat with a preternaturally solemn face which seemed to poor Rilla a haughty and offended one ."
"`` I paid eleven cents for a bottle of ink tonight , '' complained Susan ."
`` Ink is twice as high as it was last year .
Perhaps it is because Woodrow Wilson has been writing so many notes .
It must cost him considerable .
My cousin Sophia says Woodrow Wilson is not the man she expected him to be -- but then no man ever was .
"Being an old maid , I do not know much about men and have never pretended to , but my cousin Sophia is very hard on them , although she married two of them , which you might think was a fair share ."
"Albert Crawford 's chimney blew down in that big gale we had last week , and when Sophia heard the bricks clattering on the roof she thought it was a Zeppelin raid and went into hysterics ."
And Mrs. Albert Crawford says that of the two things she would have preferred the Zeppelin raid . ''
Rilla sat limply in her chair like one hypnotized .
She knew Susan would stop talking when she was ready to stop and that no earthly power could make her stop any sooner .
"As a rule , she was very fond of Susan but just now she hated her with a deadly hatred ."
It was ten o'clock .
Ken would soon have to go -- the others would soon be home -- and she had not even had a chance to explain to Ken that Fred Arnold filled no blank in her life nor ever could .
Her rainbow castle lay in ruins round her .
Kenneth got up at last .
"He realized that Susan was there to stay as long as he did , and it was a three mile walk to Martin West 's over-harbour ."
"He wondered if Rilla had put Susan up to this , not wanting to be left alone with him , lest he say something Fred Arnold 's sweetheart did not want to hear ."
"Rilla got up , too , and walked silently the length of the veranda with him ."
"They stood there for a moment , Ken on the lower step ."
The step was half sunk into the earth and mint grew thickly about and over its edge .
"So they both shouted till they were hoarse , yet nothing answered but the frogs in full chorus ."
"`` There is another tall tree over there , perhaps that 's the one , '' said Nan , whose heart sunk within her , though she still spoke bravely ."
`` I do n't think I can go any more ; my boots are so heavy I ca n't pull 'em ; '' and Robby sat down on a stone quite worn out .
`` Then we must stay here all night .
"I do n't care much , if snakes do n't come . ''"
`` I 'm frightened of snakes .
I ca n't stay all night .
"Oh , dear !"
"I do n't like to be lost , '' and Rob puckered up his face to cry , when suddenly a thought occurred to him , and he said , in a tone of perfect confidence , `` Marmar will come and find me she always does ; I ai n't afraid now . ''"
`` She wo n't know where we are . ''
"`` She did n't know I was shut up in the ice-house , but she found me ."
"I know she 'll come , '' returned Robby , so trustfully , that Nan felt relieved , and sat down by him , saying , with a remorseful sigh , `` I wish we had n't run away . ''"
"`` You made me ; but I do n't mind much Marmar will love me just the same , '' answered Rob , clinging to his sheet-anchor when all other hope was gone ."
`` I 'm so hungry .
"Let 's eat our berries , '' proposed Nan , after a pause , during which Rob began to nod ."
"`` So am I , but I ca n't eat mine , 'cause I told Marmar I 'd keep them all for her . ''"
"`` You 'll have to eat them if no one comes for us , '' said Nan , who felt like contradicting every thing just then ."
"`` If we stay here a great many days , we shall eat up all the berries in the field , and then we shall starve , '' she added grimly ."
`` I shall eat sassafras .
"I know a big tree of it , and Dan told me how squirrels dig up the roots and eat them , and I love to dig , '' returned Rob , undaunted by the prospect of starvation ."
"`` Yes ; and we can catch frogs , and cook them ."
"My father ate some once , and he said they were nice , '' put in Nan , beginning to find a spice of romance even in being lost in a huckleberry pasture ."
`` How could we cook frogs ?
we have n't got any fire . ''
"`` I do n't know ; next time I 'll have matches in my pocket , '' said Nan , rather depressed by this obstacle to the experiment in frog-cookery ."
`` Could n't we light a fire with a fire-fly ? ''
"asked Rob , hopefully , as he watched them flitting to and fro like winged sparks ."
"`` Let 's try ; '' and several minutes were pleasantly spent in catching the flies , and trying to make them kindle a green twig or two ."
"`` It 's a lie to call them fire-flies when there is n't a fire in them , '' Nan said , throwing one unhappy insect away with scorn , though it shone its best , and obligingly walked up and down the twigs to please the innocent little experimenters ."
"`` Marmar 's a good while coming , '' said Rob , after another pause , during which they watched the stars overhead , smelt the sweet fern crushed under foot , and listened to the crickets ' serenade ."
"`` I do n't see why God made any night ; day is so much pleasanter , '' said Nan , thoughtfully ."
"`` It 's to sleep in , '' answered Rob , with a yawn ."
Do not let yourself slump like poor Cousin Sophia .
"She said , when the word came , ` Ah , it is nothing but a rift in the clouds ."
We are up this week but we will be down the next . '
"` Well , Sophia Crawford , ' said I , -- for I will never give in to her , Mrs. Dr. dear -- ` God himself can not make two hills without a hollow between them , as I have heard it said , but that is no reason why we should not take the good of the hills when we are on them . '"
But Cousin Sophia moaned on .
"` Here is the Gallipolly expedition a failure and the Grand Duke Nicholas sent off , and everyone knows the Czar of Rooshia is a pro-German and the Allies have no ammunition and Bulgaria is going against us ."
"And the end is not yet , for England and France must be punished for their deadly sins until they repent in sackcloth and ashes . ' '"
"I think myself , ' I said , ` that they will do their repenting in khaki and trench mud , and it seems to me that the Huns should have a few sins to repent of also . '"
"` They are instruments in the hands of the Almighty , to purge the garner , ' said Sophia ."
"And then I got mad , Mrs. Dr. dear , and told her I did not and never would believe that the Almighty ever took such dirty instruments in hand for any purpose whatever , and that I did not consider it decent for her to be using the words of Holy Writ as glibly as she was doing in ordinary conversation ."
"She was not , I told her , a minister or even an elder ."
"And for the time being I squelched her , Mrs. Dr. dear ."
Cousin Sophia has no spirit .
"She is very different from her niece , Mrs. Dean Crawford over-harbour ."
You know the Dean Crawfords had five boys and now the new baby is another boy .
"All the connection and especially Dean Crawford were much disappointed because their hearts had been set on a girl ; but Mrs. Dean just laughed and said , ` Everywhere I went this summer I saw the sign `` MEN WANTED '' staring me in the face ."
Do you think I could go and have a girl under such circumstances ? '
"There is spirit for you , Mrs. Dr. dear ."
But Cousin Sophia would say the child was just so much more cannon fodder . ''
"Cousin Sophia had full range for her pessimism that gloomy autumn , and even Susan , incorrigible old optimist as she was , was hard put to it for cheer ."
"When Bulgaria lined up with Germany Susan only remarked scornfully , `` One more nation anxious for a licking , '' but the Greek tangle worried her beyond her powers of philosophy to endure calmly ."
"`` Constantine of Greece has a German wife , Mrs. Dr. dear , and that fact squelches hope ."
To think that I should have lived to care what kind of a wife Constantine of Greece had !
The miserable creature is under his wife 's thumb and that is a bad place for any man to be .
I am an old maid and an old maid has to be independent or she will be squashed out .
"But if I had been a married woman , Mrs. Dr. dear , I would have been meek and humble ."
It is my opinion that this Sophia of Greece is a minx . ''
Susan was furious when the news came that Venizelos had met with defeat .
"`` I could spank Constantine and skin him alive afterwards , that I could , '' she exclaimed bitterly ."
"`` Oh , Susan , I 'm surprised at you , '' said the doctor , pulling a long face ."
`` Have you no regard for the proprieties ?
Skin him alive by all means but omit the spanking . ''
"I can see a church when it hath a steeple on it ; and for my part , gossip Arblaster , methinks there is some sense in this young man ."
"Shall we go hear him , indeed ?"
"Say , shall we go hear him ? ''"
"`` I would look gladly on a pottle of strong ale , good Master Pirret , '' returned Arblaster ."
"`` How say ye , Tom ?"
But then the wallet is empty . ''
"`` I will pay , '' said the other -- `` I will pay ."
"I would fain see this matter out ; I do believe , upon my conscience , there is gold in it . ''"
"`` Nay , if ye get again to drinking , all is lost ! ''"
cried Tom .
"`` Gossip Arblaster , ye suffer your fellow to have too much liberty , '' returned Master Pirret ."
`` Would ye be led by a hired man ?
"Fy , fy ! ''"
"`` Peace , fellow ! ''"
"said Arblaster , addressing Tom ."
`` Will ye put your oar in ?
"Truly a fine pass , when the crew is to correct the skipper ! ''"
"`` Well , then , go your way , '' said Tom ; `` I wash my hands of you . ''"
"`` Set him , then , upon his feet , '' said Master Pirret ."
`` I know a privy place where we may drink and discourse . ''
"`` If I am to walk , my friends , ye must set my feet at liberty , '' said Dick , when he had been once more planted upright like a post ."
"`` He saith true , '' laughed Pirret ."
"`` Truly , he could not walk accoutred as he is ."
"Give it a slit -- out with your knife and slit it , gossip . ''"
"Even Arblaster paused at this proposal ; but as his companion continued to insist , and Dick had the sense to keep the merest wooden indifference of expression , and only shrugged his shoulders over the delay , the skipper consented at last , and cut the cords which tied his prisoner 's feet and legs ."
"Not only did this enable Dick to walk ; but the whole network of his bonds being proportionately loosened , he felt the arm behind his back begin to move more freely , and could hope , with time and trouble , to entirely disengage it ."
So much he owed already to the owlish silliness and greed of Master Pirret .
"That worthy now assumed the lead , and conducted them to the very same rude alehouse where Lawless had taken Arblaster on the day of the gale ."
"It was now quite deserted ; the fire was a pile of red embers , radiating the most ardent heat ; and when they had chosen their places , and the landlord had set before them a measure of mulled ale , both Pirret and Arblaster stretched forth their legs and squared their elbows like men bent upon a pleasant hour ."
"The table at which they sat , like all the others in the alehouse , consisted of a heavy , square board , set on a pair of barrels ; and each of the four curiously-assorted cronies sat at one side of the square , Pirret facing Arblaster , and Dick opposite to the common sailor ."
"`` And now , young man , '' said Pirret , `` to your tale ."
"It doth appear , indeed , that ye have somewhat abused our gossip Arblaster ; but what then ?"
"And how terrible it would be to be doing something you did n't like every day for ... well , say forty years ."
"Anne was of two minds whether to have her cry out then and there , or wait till she was safely in her own white room at home ."
"Before she could decide there was a click of heels and a silken swish on the porch floor , and Anne found herself confronted by a lady whose appearance made her recall a recent criticism of Mr. Harrison 's on an overdressed female he had seen in a Charlottetown store ."
`` She looked like a head-on collision between a fashion plate and a nightmare . ''
"The newcomer was gorgeously arrayed in a pale blue summer silk , puffed , frilled , and shirred wherever puff , frill , or shirring could possibly be placed ."
"Her head was surmounted by a huge white chiffon hat , bedecked with three long but rather stringy ostrich feathers ."
"A veil of pink chiffon , lavishly sprinkled with huge black dots , hung like a flounce from the hat brim to her shoulders and floated off in two airy streamers behind her ."
"She wore all the jewelry that could be crowded on one small woman , and a very strong odor of perfume attended her ."
"`` I am Mrs. DonNELL ... Mrs. H. B. DonNELL , '' announced this vision , `` and I have come in to see you about something Clarice Almira told me when she came home to dinner today ."
It annoyed me EXCESSIVELY . ''
"`` I 'm sorry , '' faltered Anne , vainly trying to recollect any incident of the morning connected with the Donnell children ."
`` Clarice Almira told me that you pronounced our name DONnell .
"Now , Miss Shirley , the correct pronunciation of our name is DonNELL ... accent on the last syllable ."
I hope you 'll remember this in future . ''
"`` I 'll try to , '' gasped Anne , choking back a wild desire to laugh ."
`` I know by experience that it 's very unpleasant to have one 's name SPELLED wrong and I suppose it must be even worse to have it pronounced wrong . ''
`` Certainly it is .
And Clarice Almira also informed me that you call my son Jacob . ''
"`` He told me his name was Jacob , '' protested Anne ."
"`` I might well have expected that , '' said Mrs. H. B. Donnell , in a tone which implied that gratitude in children was not to be looked for in this degenerate age ."
"`` That boy has such plebeian tastes , Miss Shirley ."
"When he was born I wanted to call him St. Clair ... it sounds SO aristocratic , does n't it ?"
But his father insisted he should be called Jacob after his uncle .
"I yielded , because Uncle Jacob was a rich old bachelor ."
"And what do you think , Miss Shirley ?"
When our innocent boy was five years old Uncle Jacob actually went and got married and now he has three boys of his own .
Did you ever hear of such ingratitude ?
"The moment the invitation to the wedding ... for he had the impertinence to send us an invitation , Miss Shirley ... came to the house I said , ` No more Jacobs for me , thank you . '"
From that day I called my son St. Clair and St. Clair I am determined he shall be called .
"His father obstinately continues to call him Jacob , and the boy himself has a perfectly unaccountable preference for the vulgar name ."
But St. Clair he is and St. Clair he shall remain .
"You will kindly remember this , Miss Shirley , will you not ?"
"Come away now , you must not stand any longer ."
Come and rest while I fetch a dish to put the flowers in till you want them ; '' and Mrs. Pecq turned her round with her small Maying safely done .
"`` I did n't think I 'd ever be able to do even so much , and here I am walking and sitting up , and going to drive some day ."
Is n't it nice that I 'm not to be a poor Lucinda after all ? ''
and Jill drew a long sigh of relief that six months instead of twenty years would probably be the end of her captivity .
"`` Yes , thank Heaven !"
"I do n't think I could have borne that ; '' and the mother took Jill in her arms as if she were a baby , holding her close for a minute , and laying her down with a tender kiss that made the arms cling about her neck as her little girl returned it heartily , for all sorts of new , sweet feelings seemed to be budding in both , born of great joy and thankfulness ."
"Then Mrs. Pecq hurried away to see about tea for the hungry boys , and Jill watched the pleasant twilight deepen as she lay singing to herself one of the songs her friend taught her because it fitted her so well ."
"`` A little bird I am , Shut from the fields of air , And in my cage I sit and sing To Him who placed me there : Well pleased a prisoner to be , Because , my God , it pleases Thee !"
"`` Naught have I else to do ; I sing the whole day long ; And He whom most I love to please Doth listen to my song , He caught and bound my wandering wing , But still He bends to hear me sing . ''"
"`` Now we are ready for you , so bring on your flowers , '' said Molly to the boys , as she and Merry added their store of baskets to the gay show Jill had set forth on the long table ready for the evening 's work ."
"`` They would n't let me see one , but I guess they have had good luck , they look so jolly , '' answered Jill , looking at Gus , Frank , and Jack , who stood laughing , each with a large basket in his hands ."
`` Fair to middling .
Just look in and see ; '' with which cheerful remark Gus tipped up his basket and displayed a few bits of green at the bottom .
`` I did better .
"Now , do n't all scream at once over these beauties ; '' and Frank shook out some evergreen sprigs , half a dozen saxifrages , and two or three forlorn violets with hardly any stems ."
"`` I do n't brag , but here 's the best of all the three , '' chuckled Jack , producing a bunch of feathery carrot-tops , with a few half-shut dandelions trying to look brave and gay ."
"`` Oh , boys , is that all ? ''"
`` What shall we do ? ''
"`` We 've only a few house-flowers , and all those baskets to fill , '' cried the girls , in despair ; for Merry 's contribution had been small , and Molly had only a handful of artificial flowers `` to fill up , '' she said ."
`` It is n't our fault : it is the late spring .
"We ca n't make flowers , can we ? ''"
"asked Frank , in a tone of calm resignation ."
"`` Could n't you buy some , then ? ''"
"said Molly , smoothing her crumpled morning-glories , with a sigh ."
`` Who ever heard of a fellow having any money left the last day of the month ? ''
"demanded Gus , severely ."
`` Or girls either .
"I spent all mine in ribbon and paper for my baskets , and now they are of no use ."
It 's a shame ! ''
"lamented Jill , while Merry began to thin out her full baskets to fill the empty ones ."
`` Hold on ! ''
"I helped her walk up through the maple grove and up to her room , and then she said , ` Rob -- is -- living , ' as if the words were torn out of her , and flung herself on her bed and cried and cried and cried ."
I never saw anyone cry so before .
All the tears that she had n't shed all that week came then .
"She cried most of last night , I think , but her face this morning looked as if she had seen a vision of some kind , and we were all so happy that we were almost afraid ."
`` Di and Nan are home for a couple of weeks .
Then they go back to Red Cross work in the training camp at Kingsport .
I envy them .
"Father says I 'm doing just as good work here , with Jims and my Junior Reds ."
But it lacks the romance theirs must have .
`` Kut has fallen .
"It was almost a relief when it did fall , we had been dreading it so long ."
It crushed us flat for a day and then we picked up and put it behind us .
Cousin Sophia was as gloomy as usual and came over and groaned that the British were losing everywhere . ''
"` They 're good losers , ' said Susan grimly ."
` When they lose a thing they keep on looking till they find it again !
"Anyhow , my king and country need me now to cut potato sets for the back garden , so get you a knife and help me , Sophia Crawford ."
It will divert your thoughts and keep you from worrying over a campaign that you are not called upon to run . '
"`` Susan is an old brick , and the way she flattens out poor Cousin Sophia is beautiful to behold ."
"`` As for Verdun , the battle goes on and on , and we see-saw between hope and fear ."
But I know that strange dream of Miss Oliver 's foretold the victory of France .
` They shall not pass . ' ''
"CHAPTER XX NORMAN DOUGLAS SPEAKS OUT IN MEETING `` Where are you wandering , Anne o ' mine ? ''"
"asked the doctor , who even yet , after twenty-four years of marriage , occasionally addressed his wife thus when nobody was about ."
"Anne was sitting on the veranda steps , gazing absently over the wonderful bridal world of spring blossom , Beyond the white orchard was a copse of dark young firs and creamy wild cherries , where the robins were whistling madly ; for it was evening and the fire of early stars was burning over the maple grove ."
Anne came back with a little sigh .
"`` I was just taking relief from intolerable realities in a dream , Gilbert -- a dream that all our children were home again -- and all small again -- playing in Rainbow Valley ."
"It is always so silent now -- but I was imagining I heard clear voices and gay , childish sounds coming up as I used to ."
"I could hear Jem 's whistle and Walter 's yodel , and the twins ' laughter , and for just a few blessed minutes I forgot about the guns on the Western front , and had a little false , sweet happiness . ''"
The doctor did not answer .
"Sometimes his work tricked him into forgetting for a few moments the Western front , but not often ."
There was a good deal of grey now in his still thick curls that had not been there two years ago .
"Yet he smiled down into the starry eyes he loved -- the eyes that had once been so full of laughter , and now seemed always full of unshed tears ."
"`` This morning , '' he said , `` I was somewhat jealous of your favour ; it hath not been of a long growth ; and now , Sir Richard , it is with a very good heart that I offer you this horse -- to ride away with . ''"
"`` Suffer me yet a moment , '' replied Dick ."
`` This favour of mine -- whereupon was it founded ? ''
"`` Upon your name , '' answered Catesby ."
`` It is my lord 's chief superstition .
"Were my name Richard , I should be an earl to-morrow . ''"
"`` Well , sir , I thank you , '' returned Dick ; `` and since I am little likely to follow these great fortunes , I will even say farewell ."
"I will not pretend I was displeased to think myself upon the road to fortune ; but I will not pretend , neither , that I am over-sorry to be done with it ."
"Command and riches , they are brave things , to be sure ; but a word in your ear -- yon duke of yours , he is a fearsome lad . ''"
Catesby laughed .
"`` Nay , '' said he , `` of a verity he that rides with Crooked Dick will ride deep ."
"Well , God keep us all from evil !"
Speed ye well . ''
"Thereupon Dick put himself at the head of his men , and giving the word of command , rode off ."
"He made straight across the town , following what he supposed to be the route of Sir Daniel , and spying around for any signs that might decide if he were right ."
"The streets were strewn with the dead and the wounded , whose fate , in the bitter frost , was far the more pitiable ."
"Gangs of the victors went from house to house , pillaging and stabbing , and sometimes singing together as they went ."
"From different quarters , as he rode on , the sounds of violence and outrage came to young Shelton 's ears ; now the blows of the sledge-hammer on some barricaded door , and now the miserable shrieks of women ."
Dick 's heart had just been awakened .
He had just seen the cruel consequences of his own behaviour ; and the thought of the sum of misery that was now acting in the whole of Shoreby filled him with despair .
"At length he reached the outskirts , and there , sure enough , he saw straight before him the same broad , beaten track across the snow that he had marked from the summit of the church ."
"Here , then , he went the faster on ; but still , as he rode , he kept a bright eye upon the fallen men and horses that lay beside the track ."
"Many of these , he was relieved to see , wore Sir Daniel 's colours , and the faces of some , who lay upon their back , he even recognised ."
"About half-way between the town and the forest , those whom he was following had plainly been assailed by archers ; for the corpses lay pretty closely scattered , each pierced by an arrow ."
"And here Dick spied among the rest the body of a very young lad , whose face was somehow hauntingly familiar to him ."
"He halted his troop , dismounted , and raised the lad 's head ."
"As he did so , the hood fell back , and a profusion of long brown hair unrolled itself ."
At the same time the eyes opened .
`` Ah !
lion driver ! ''
said a feeble voice .
`` She is farther on .
Father and mother went up to Avonlea .
"Father thought the change would do mother good , and they wanted to see poor Aunt Diana , whose son Jock had been seriously wounded a short time before ."
"They left Susan and me to keep house , and father expected to be back the next day ."
But he never got back for a week .
"That night it began to storm again , and it stormed unbrokenly for four days ."
It was the worst and longest storm that Prince Edward Island has known for years .
"Everything was disorganized -- the roads were completely choked up , the trains blockaded , and the telephone wires put entirely out of commission ."
`` And then Jims took ill .
"`` He had a little cold when father and mother went away , and he kept getting worse for a couple of days , but it did n't occur to me that there was danger of anything serious ."
"I never even took his temperature , and I ca n't forgive myself , because it was sheer carelessness ."
The truth is I had slumped just then .
"Mother was away , so I let myself go ."
"All at once I was tired of keeping up and pretending to be brave and cheerful , and I just gave up for a few days and spent most of the time lying on my face on my bed , crying ."
I neglected Jims -- that is the hateful truth -- I was cowardly and false to what I promised Walter -- and if Jims had died I could never have forgiven myself .
"`` Then , the third night after father and mother went away , Jims suddenly got worse -- oh , so much worse -- all at once ."
Susan and I were all alone .
Gertrude had been at Lowbridge when the storm began and had never got back .
At first we were not much alarmed .
Jims has had several bouts of croup and Susan and Morgan and I have always brought him through without much trouble .
But it was n't very long before we were dreadfully alarmed . '' '
"I never saw croup like this before , ' said Susan ."
"`` As for me , I knew , when it was too late , what kind of croup it was ."
I knew it was not the ordinary croup -- ` false croup ' as doctors call it -- but the ` true croup ' -- and I knew that it was a deadly and dangerous thing .
And father was away and there was no doctor nearer than Lowbridge -- and we could not ` phone and neither horse nor man could get through the drifts that night .
"`` Gallant little Jims put up a good fight for his life , -- Susan and I tried every remedy we could think of or find in father 's books , but he continued to grow worse ."
It was heart-rending to see and hear him .
"He gasped so horribly for breath -- the poor little soul -- and his face turned a dreadful bluish colour and had such an agonized expression , and he kept struggling with his little hands , as if he were appealing to us to help him somehow ."
"I found myself thinking that the boys who had been gassed at the front must have looked like that , and the thought haunted me amid all my dread and misery over Jims ."
And all the time the fatal membrane in his wee throat grew and thickened and he could n't get it up .
"`` Oh , I was just wild !"
I never realized how dear Jims was to me until that moment .
And I felt so utterly helpless . ''
"Look at the four of them , Wendy and Michael over there , John here , and Mrs. Darling by the fire ."
There should have been a fourth night-light .
While she slept she had a dream .
She dreamt that the Neverland had come too near and that a strange boy had broken through from it .
"He did not alarm her , for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many women who have no children ."
Perhaps he is to be found in the faces of some mothers also .
"But in her dream he had rent the film that obscures the Neverland , and she saw Wendy and John and Michael peeping through the gap ."
"The dream by itself would have been a trifle , but while she was dreaming the window of the nursery blew open , and a boy did drop on the floor ."
"He was accompanied by a strange light , no bigger than your fist , which darted about the room like a living thing ; and I think it must have been this light that wakened Mrs. Darling ."
"She started up with a cry , and saw the boy , and somehow she knew at once that he was Peter Pan ."
If you or I or Wendy had been there we should have seen that he was very like Mrs. Darling 's kiss .
"He was a lovely boy , clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees ; but the most entrancing thing about him was that he had all his first teeth ."
"When he saw she was a grown-up , he gnashed the little pearls at her ."
"CHAPTER II THE SHADOW Mrs. Darling screamed , and , as if in answer to a bell , the door opened , and Nana entered , returned from her evening out ."
"She growled and sprang at the boy , who leapt lightly through the window ."
"Again Mrs. Darling screamed , this time in distress for him , for she thought he was killed , and she ran down into the street to look for his little body , but it was not there ; and she looked up , and in the black night she could see nothing but what she thought was a shooting star ."
"She returned to the nursery , and found Nana with something in her mouth , which proved to be the boy 's shadow ."
"As he leapt at the window Nana had closed it quickly , too late to catch him , but his shadow had not had time to get out ; slam went the window and snapped it off ."
"You may be sure Mrs. Darling examined the shadow carefully , but it was quite the ordinary kind ."
Nana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow .
"She hung it out at the window , meaning ` He is sure to come back for it ; let us put it where he can get it easily without disturbing the children . '"
But unfortunately Mrs. Darling could not leave it hanging out at the window ; it looked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the house .
"She thought of showing it to Mr. Darling , but he was totting up winter greatcoats for John and Michael , with a wet towel round his head to keep his brain clear , and it seemed a shame to trouble him ; besides , she knew exactly what he would say : ` It all comes of having a dog for a nurse . '"
"She decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a drawer , until a fitting opportunity came for telling her husband ."
Ah me !
"The opportunity came a week later , on that never-to-be-forgotten Friday ."
Of course it was a Friday . '
"I ought to have been specially careful on a Friday , ' she used to say afterwards to her husband , while perhaps Nana was on the other side of her , holding her hand ."
"` No , no , ' Mr. Darling always said , ' I am responsible for it all ."
"I , George Darling , did it ."
"Mea culpa , mea culpa ."
' He had had a classical education .
"They rode as for their lives , in complete disorder ; some of them were wounded ; riderless horses galloped at their side with bloody saddles ."
They were plainly fugitives from the great battle .
"The noise of their passage had scarce begun to die away towards Shoreby , before fresh hoofs came echoing in their wake , and another deserter clattered down the road ; this time a single rider and , by his splendid armour , a man of high degree ."
"Close after him there followed several baggage-waggons , fleeing at an ungainly canter , the drivers flailing at the horses as if for life ."
These must have run early in the day ; but their cowardice was not to save them .
"For just before they came abreast of where the lads stood wondering , a man in hacked armour , and seemingly beside himself with fury , overtook the waggons , and with the truncheon of a sword , began to cut the drivers down ."
"Some leaped from their places and plunged into the wood ; the others he sabred as they sat , cursing them the while for cowards in a voice that was scarce human ."
"All this time the noise in the distance had continued to increase ; the rumble of carts , the clatter of horses , the cries of men , a great , confused rumour , came swelling on the wind ; and it was plain that the rout of a whole army was pouring , like an inundation , down the road ."
Dick stood sombre .
"He had meant to follow the highway till the turn for Holywood , and now he had to change his plan ."
"But above all , he had recognised the colours of Earl Risingham , and he knew that the battle had gone finally against the rose of Lancaster ."
"Had Sir Daniel joined , and was he now a fugitive and ruined ?"
"or had he deserted to the side of York , and was he forfeit to honour ?"
It was an ugly choice .
"`` Come , '' he said , sternly ; and , turning on his heel , he began to walk forward through the grove , with Matcham limping in his rear ."
For some time they continued to thread the forest in silence .
It was now growing late ; the sun was setting in the plain beyond Kettley ; the tree-tops overhead glowed golden ; but the shadows had begun to grow darker and the chill of the night to fall .
`` If there were anything to eat ! ''
"cried Dick , suddenly , pausing as he spoke ."
Matcham sat down and began to weep .
"`` Ye can weep for your own supper , but when it was to save men 's lives , your heart was hard enough , '' said Dick , contemptuously ."
"`` Y ' ` ave seven deaths upon your conscience , Master John ; I 'll ne'er forgive you that . ''"
`` Conscience ! ''
"cried Matcham , looking fiercely up ."
`` Mine !
And ye have the man 's red blood upon your dagger !
"And wherefore did ye slay him , the poor soul ?"
"He drew his arrow , but he let not fly ; he held you in his hand , and spared you !"
"'T is as brave to kill a kitten , as a man that not defends himself . ''"
Dick was struck dumb .
`` I slew him fair .
"I ran me in upon his bow , '' he cried ."
I came here and told your aunt not to let it occur again .
She has let it occur again .
"Where 's your aunt , miss ?"
"I just want to see her for a minute and give her a piece of my mind ... a piece of J. A. Harrison 's mind , miss . ''"
"`` If you mean Miss Marilla Cuthbert , she is not my aunt , and she has gone down to East Grafton to see a distant relative of hers who is very ill , '' said Anne , with due increase of dignity at every word ."
`` I am very sorry that my cow should have broken into your oats ... she is my cow and not Miss Cuthbert 's ... Matthew gave her to me three years ago when she was a little calf and he bought her from Mr. Bell . ''
"`` Sorry , miss !"
Sorry is n't going to help matters any .
"You 'd better go and look at the havoc that animal has made in my oats ... trampled them from center to circumference , miss . ''"
"`` I am very sorry , '' repeated Anne firmly , `` but perhaps if you kept your fences in better repair Dolly might not have broken in ."
It is your part of the line fence that separates your oatfield from our pasture and I noticed the other day that it was not in very good condition . ''
"`` My fence is all right , '' snapped Mr. Harrison , angrier than ever at this carrying of the war into the enemy 's country ."
`` The jail fence could n't keep a demon of a cow like that out .
"And I can tell you , you redheaded snippet , that if the cow is yours , as you say , you 'd be better employed in watching her out of other people 's grain than in sitting round reading yellow-covered novels , '' ... with a scathing glance at the innocent tan-colored Virgil by Anne 's feet ."
Something at that moment was red besides Anne 's hair ... which had always been a tender point with her .
"`` I 'd rather have red hair than none at all , except a little fringe round my ears , '' she flashed ."
"The shot told , for Mr. Harrison was really very sensitive about his bald head ."
"His anger choked him up again and he could only glare speechlessly at Anne , who recovered her temper and followed up her advantage ."
"`` I can make allowance for you , Mr. Harrison , because I have an imagination ."
I can easily imagine how very trying it must be to find a cow in your oats and I shall not cherish any hard feelings against you for the things you 've said .
I promise you that Dolly shall never break into your oats again .
I give you my word of honor on THAT point . ''
"`` Well , mind you she does n't , '' muttered Mr. Harrison in a somewhat subdued tone ; but he stamped off angrily enough and Anne heard him growling to himself until he was out of earshot ."
"Grievously disturbed in mind , Anne marched across the yard and shut the naughty Jersey up in the milking pen ."
"`` She ca n't possibly get out of that unless she tears the fence down , '' she reflected ."
`` She looks pretty quiet now .
I daresay she has sickened herself on those oats .
"I wish I 'd sold her to Mr. Shearer when he wanted her last week , but I thought it was just as well to wait until we had the auction of the stock and let them all go together ."
I believe it is true about Mr. Harrison being a crank .
Certainly there 's nothing of the kindred spirit about HIM . ''
Anne had always a weather eye open for kindred spirits .
"Marilla Cuthbert was driving into the yard as Anne returned from the house , and the latter flew to get tea ready ."
"Howbeit , if he is to marry , marry him in the name of Mary , and be done ! ''"
"`` Nay , he is a brave lad -- I know it , '' said Lord Foxham ."
"`` Content ye , then , Sir Richard ."
"I have compounded this affair with Master Hamley , and to-morrow ye shall wed. '' Whereupon Dick judged it prudent to withdraw ; but he was not yet clear of the refectory , when a man , but newly alighted at the gate , came running four stairs at a bound , and , brushing through the abbey servants , threw himself on one knee before the duke ."
"`` Victory , my lord , '' he cried ."
"And before Dick had got to the chamber set apart for him as Lord Foxham 's guest , the troops in the holm were cheering around their fires ; for upon that same day , not twenty miles away , a second crushing blow had been dealt to the power of Lancaster ."
"CHAPTER VII -- DICK 'S REVENGE The next morning Dick was afoot before the sun , and having dressed himself to the best advantage with the aid of the Lord Foxham 's baggage , and got good reports of Joan , he set forth on foot to walk away his impatience ."
"For some while he made rounds among the soldiery , who were getting to arms in the wintry twilight of the dawn and by the red glow of torches ; but gradually he strolled further afield , and at length passed clean beyond the outposts , and walked alone in the frozen forest , waiting for the sun ."
His thoughts were both quiet and happy .
"His brief favour with the Duke he could not find it in his heart to mourn ; with Joan to wife , and my Lord Foxham for a faithful patron , he looked most happily upon the future ; and in the past he found but little to regret ."
"As he thus strolled and pondered , the solemn light of the morning grew more clear , the east was already coloured by the sun , and a little scathing wind blew up the frozen snow ."
"He turned to go home ; but even as he turned , his eye lit upon a figure behind , a tree ."
`` Stand ! ''
he cried .
`` Who goes ? ''
The figure stepped forth and waved its hand like a dumb person .
"It was arrayed like a pilgrim , the hood lowered over the face , but Dick , in an instant , recognised Sir Daniel ."
"He strode up to him , drawing his sword ; and the knight , putting his hand in his bosom , as if to seize a hidden weapon , steadfastly awaited his approach ."
"`` Well , Dickon , '' said Sir Daniel , `` how is it to be ?"
Do ye make war upon the fallen ? ''
"`` I made no war upon your life , '' replied the lad ; `` I was your true friend until ye sought for mine ; but ye have sought for it greedily . ''"
"`` Nay -- self-defence , '' replied the knight ."
"`` And now , boy , the news of this battle , and the presence of yon crooked devil here in mine own wood , have broken me beyond all help ."
"I go to Holywood for sanctuary ; thence overseas , with what I can carry , and to begin life again in Burgundy or France . ''"
"`` Ye may not go to Holywood , '' said Dick ."
`` How !
May not ? ''
asked the knight .
"`` Look ye , Sir Daniel , this is my marriage morn , '' said Dick ; `` and yon sun that is to rise will make the brightest day that ever shone for me ."
"Your life is forfeit -- doubly forfeit , for my father 's death and your own practices to meward ."
But I myself have done amiss ; I have brought about men 's deaths ; and upon this glad day I will be neither judge nor hangman .
"An ye were the devil , I would not lay a hand on you ."
I had a big puncheon of rainwater by the spout which I was reserving for making soap .
And you and Walter began quarrelling over the kitten .
"Walter was at one side of the puncheon standing on a chair , holding the kitten , and you were standing on a chair at the other side ."
You leaned across that puncheon and grabbed the kitten and pulled .
You were always a great hand for taking what you wanted without too much ceremony .
"Walter held on tight and the poor kitten yelled but you dragged Walter and the kitten half over and then you both lost your balance and tumbled into that puncheon , kitten and all ."
If I had not been on the spot you would both have been drowned .
"I flew to the rescue and hauled you all three out before much harm was done , and your mother , who had seen it all from the upstairs window , came down and picked you up , dripping as you were , and gave you a beautiful spanking ."
"Ah , '' said Susan with a sigh , `` those were happy old days at Ingleside . ''"
"`` Must have been , '' said Ken ."
His voice sounded queer and stiff .
Rilla supposed he was hopelessly enraged .
The truth was he dared not trust his voice lest it betray his frantic desire to laugh .
"`` Rilla here , now , '' said Susan , looking affectionately at that unhappy damsel , `` never was much spanked ."
She was a real well-behaved child for the most part .
But her father did spank her once .
"She got two bottles of pills out of his office and dared Alice Clow to see which of them could swallow all the pills first , and if her father had not happened in the nick of time those two children would have been corpses by night ."
"As it was , they were both sick enough shortly after ."
But the doctor spanked Rilla then and there and he made such a thorough job of it that she never meddled with anything in his office afterwards .
"We hear a great deal nowadays of something that is called ` moral persuasion , ' but in my opinion a good spanking and no nagging afterwards is a much better thing . ''"
Rilla wondered viciously whether Susan meant to relate all the family spankings .
But Susan had finished with the subject and branched off to another cheerful one .
"`` I remember little Tod MacAllister over-harbour killed himself that very way , eating up a whole box of fruitatives because he thought they were candy ."
It was a very sad affair .
"He was , '' said Susan earnestly , `` the very cutest little corpse I ever laid my eyes on ."
"It was very careless of his mother to leave the fruitatives where he could get them , but she was well-known to be a heedless creature ."
One day she found a nest of five eggs as she was going across the fields to church with a brand new blue silk dress on .
"So she put them in the pocket of her petticoat and when she got to church she forgot all about them and sat down on them and her dress was ruined , not to speak of the petticoat ."
Let me see -- would not Tod be some relation of yours ?
Your great grandmother West was a MacAllister .
Her brother Amos was a MacDonaldite in religion .
I am told he used to take the jerks something fearful .
I do n't mind as long as Grandma is all right .
"She is away to-night , or I should not be here , '' he added , as if some excuse was necessary ."
"Merry needed no hint , for her tender heart was touched by the vision of her friend in a garret , and she suddenly rejoiced that there was ham and eggs for supper , so that he might be well fed once , at least , before he went away to feed on artistic crusts ."
"`` Being here , come in and spend the evening ."
"The boys will like to hear the news , and so will father ."
"Do , now . ''"
"It was impossible to refuse the invitation he had been longing for , and in they went to the great delight of Roxy , who instantly retired to the pantry , smiling significantly , and brought out the most elaborate pie in honor of the occasion ."
"Merry touched up the table , and put a little vase of flowers in the middle to redeem the vulgarity of doughnuts ."
"Of course the boys upset it , but as there was company nothing was said , and Ralph devoured his supper with the appetite of a hungry boy , while watching Merry eat bread and cream out of an old-fashioned silver porringer , and thinking it the sweetest sight he ever beheld ."
"Then the young people gathered about the table , full of the new plans , and the elders listened as they rested after the week 's work ."
"A pleasant evening , for they all liked Ralph , but as the parents watched Merry sitting among the great lads like a little queen among her subjects , half unconscious as yet of the power in her hands , they nodded to one another , and then shook their heads as if they said , -- `` I 'm afraid the time is coming , mother . ''"
"`` No danger as long as she do n't know it , father . ''"
"At nine the boys went off to the barn , the farmer to wind up the eight-day clock , and the housewife to see how the baked beans and Indian pudding for to-morrow were getting on in the oven ."
"Ralph took up his hat to go , saying as he looked at the shade on the tall student lamp , -- `` What a good light that gives !"
"I can see it as I go home every night , and it burns up here like a beacon ."
"I always look for it , and it hardly ever fails to be burning ."
"Sort of cheers up the way , you know , when I 'm tired or low in my mind . ''"
`` Then I 'm very glad I got it .
"I liked the shape , but the boys laughed at it as they did at my bulrushes in a ginger-jar over there ."
"I 'd been reading about ` household art , ' and I thought I 'd try a little , '' answered Merry , laughing at her own whims ."
"`` You 've got a better sort of household art , I think , for you make people happy and places pretty , without fussing over it ."
"This room is ever so much improved every time I come , though I hardly see what it is except the flowers , '' said Ralph , looking from the girl to the tall calla that bent its white cup above her as if to pour its dew upon her head ."
`` Is n't that lovely ?
I tried to draw it -- the shape was so graceful I wanted to keep it .
But I could n't .
Is n't it a pity such beautiful things wo n't last forever ? ''
and Merry looked regretfully at the half-faded one that grew beside the fresh blossom .
`` I can keep it for you .
It would look well in plaster .
May I ? ''
asked Ralph .
"`` Thank you , I should like that very much ."
"`` Well , I will ; but it 's too bad of Kitty-mouse to want our very nicest things , '' sighed Daisy ."
"`` A sackerryfice means to give up what you are fond of , so we must , '' explained Demi , to whom the new idea had been suggested by hearing Uncle Fritz describe the customs of the Greeks to the big boys who were reading about them in school ."
"`` Is Rob coming too , '' asked Daisy ."
"`` Yes , and he is going to bring his toy village ; it is all made of wood , you know , and will burn nicely ."
"We 'll have a grand bonfire , and see them blaze up , wo n't we ? ''"
"This brilliant prospect consoled Daisy , and she ate her dinner with a row of paper dolls before her , as a sort of farewell banquet ."
"At the appointed hour the sacrificial train set forth , each child bearing the treasures demanded by the insatiable Kitty-mouse ."
"Teddy insisted on going also , and seeing that all the others had toys , he tucked a squeaking lamb under one arm , and old Annabella under the other , little dreaming what anguish the latter idol was to give him ."
"`` Where are you going , my chickens ? ''"
"asked Mrs. Jo , as the flock passed her door ."
`` To play by the big rock ; ca n't we ? ''
"`` Yes , only do n't do near the pond , and take good care of baby . ''"
"`` I always do , '' said Daisy , leading forth her charge with a capable air ."
"`` Now , you must all sit round , and not move till I tell you ."
"This flat stone is an altar , and I am going to make a fire on it . ''"
"Demi then proceeded to kindle up a small blaze , as he had seen the boys do at picnics ."
"When the flame burned well , he ordered the company to march round it three times and then stand in a circle ."
"`` I shall begin , and as fast as my things are burnt , you must bring yours . ''"
"With that he solemnly laid on a little paper book full of pictures , pasted in by himself ; this was followed by a dilapidated boat , and then one by one the unhappy leaden soldiers marched to death ."
"Not one faltered or hung back , from the splendid red and yellow captain to the small drummer who had lost his legs ; all vanished in the flames and mingled in one common pool of melted lead ."
"`` Now , Daisy ! ''"
"called the high priest of Kitty-mouse , when his rich offerings had been consumed , to the great satisfaction of the children ."
"`` My dear dollies , how can I let them go ? ''"
"moaned Daisy , hugging the entire dozen with a face full of maternal woe ."
"`` You must , '' commanded Demi ; and with a farewell kiss to each , Daisy laid her blooming dolls upon the coals ."
"`` Let me keep one , the dear blue thing , she is so sweet , '' besought the poor little mamma , clutching her last in despair ."
`` More !
more ! ''
"growled an awful voice , and Demi cried , `` that 's the Kitty-mouse !"
"she must have every one , quick , or she will scratch us . ''"
"In went the precious blue belle , flounces , rosy hat , and all , and nothing but a few black flakes remained of that bright band ."
"`` Stand the houses and trees round , and let them catch themselves ; it will be like a real fire then , '' said Demi , who liked variety even in his `` sackerryfices . ''"
"`` Put up your swords , boys , '' cried the newcomer , `` this man is mine . ''"
Thus suddenly Hook found himself face to face with Peter .
The others drew back and formed a ring around them .
"For long the two enemies looked at one another , Hook shuddering slightly , and Peter with the strange smile upon his face ."
"`` So , Pan , '' said Hook at last , `` this is all your doing . ''"
"`` Ay , James Hook , '' came the stern answer , `` it is all my doing . ''"
"`` Proud and insolent youth , '' said Hook , `` prepare to meet thy doom . ''"
"`` Dark and sinister man , '' Peter answered , `` have at thee . ''"
"Without more words they fell to , and for a space there was no advantage to either blade ."
"Peter was a superb swordsman , and parried with dazzling rapidity ; ever and anon he followed up a feint with a lunge that got past his foe 's defence , but his shorter reach stood him in ill stead , and he could not drive the steel home ."
"Hook , scarcely his inferior in brilliancy , but not quite so nimble in wrist play , forced him back by the weight of his onset , hoping suddenly to end all with a favourite thrust , taught him long ago by Barbecue at Rio ; but to his astonishment he found this thrust turned aside again and again ."
"Then he sought to close and give the quietus with his iron hook , which all this time had been pawing the air ; but Peter doubled under it and , lunging fiercely , pierced him in the ribs ."
"At the sight of his own blood , whose peculiar colour , you remember , was offensive to him , the sword fell from Hook 's hand , and he was at Peter 's mercy ."
`` Now ! ''
"cried all the boys , but with a magnificent gesture Peter invited his opponent to pick up his sword ."
"Hook did so instantly , but with a tragic feeling that Peter was showing good form ."
"Hitherto he had thought it was some fiend fighting him , but darker suspicions assailed him now ."
"`` Pan , who and what art thou ? ''"
he cried huskily .
"`` I 'm youth , I 'm joy , '' Peter answered at a venture , `` I 'm a little bird that has broken out of the egg . ''"
"This , of course , was nonsense ; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was , which is the very pinnacle of good form ."
"`` To ' t again , '' he cried despairingly ."
"He fought now like a human flail , and every sweep of that terrible sword would have severed in twain any man or boy who obstructed it ; but Peter fluttered round him as if the very wind it made blew him out of the danger zone ."
And again and again he darted in and pricked .
Hook was fighting now without hope .
That passionate breast no longer asked for life ; but for one boon it craved : to see Peter show bad form before it was cold forever .
Abandoning the fight he rushed into the powder magazine and fired it .
"`` In two minutes , '' he cried , `` the ship will be blown to pieces . ''"
"Now , now , he thought , true form will show ."
"But Peter issued from the powder magazine with the shell in his hands , and calmly flung it overboard ."
What sort of form was Hook himself showing ?
"Misguided man though he was , we may be glad , without sympathising with him , that in the end he was true to the traditions of his race ."
The name is DONnell and always has been .
"The woman is crazy , that 's what ."
"She has a pug dog she calls Queenie and it has its meals at the table along with the family , eating off a china plate ."
I 'd be afraid of a judgment if I was her .
"Thomas says Donnell himself is a sensible , hard-working man , but he had n't much gumption when he picked out a wife , that 's what . ''"
"VI All Sorts and Conditions of Men ... and women A September day on Prince Edward Island hills ; a crisp wind blowing up over the sand dunes from the sea ; a long red road , winding through fields and woods , now looping itself about a corner of thick set spruces , now threading a plantation of young maples with great feathery sheets of ferns beneath them , now dipping down into a hollow where a brook flashed out of the woods and into them again , now basking in open sunshine between ribbons of golden-rod and smoke-blue asters ; air athrill with the pipings of myriads of crickets , those glad little pensioners of the summer hills ; a plump brown pony ambling along the road ; two girls behind him , full to the lips with the simple , priceless joy of youth and life ."
"`` Oh , this is a day left over from Eden , is n't it , Diana ? ''"
... and Anne sighed for sheer happiness .
`` The air has magic in it .
"Look at the purple in the cup of the harvest valley , Diana ."
"And oh , do smell the dying fir !"
It 's coming up from that little sunny hollow where Mr. Eben Wright has been cutting fence poles .
Bliss is it on such a day to be alive ; but to smell dying fir is very heaven .
That 's two thirds Wordsworth and one third Anne Shirley .
"It does n't seem possible that there should be dying fir in heaven , does it ?"
And yet it does n't seem to me that heaven would be quite perfect if you could n't get a whiff of dead fir as you went through its woods .
Perhaps we 'll have the odor there without the death .
"Yes , I think that will be the way ."
That delicious aroma must be the souls of the firs ... and of course it will be just souls in heaven . ''
"`` Trees have n't souls , '' said practical Diana , `` but the smell of dead fir is certainly lovely ."
I 'm going to make a cushion and fill it with fir needles .
"You 'd better make one too , Anne . ''"
`` I think I shall ... and use it for my naps .
I 'd be certain to dream I was a dryad or a woodnymph then .
"But just this minute I 'm well content to be Anne Shirley , Avonlea schoolma'am , driving over a road like this on such a sweet , friendly day . ''"
"`` It 's a lovely day but we have anything but a lovely task before us , '' sighed Diana ."
"`` Why on earth did you offer to canvass this road , Anne ?"
"Almost all the cranks in Avonlea live along it , and we 'll probably be treated as if we were begging for ourselves ."
It 's the very worst road of all . ''
`` That is why I chose it .
Of course Gilbert and Fred would have taken this road if we had asked them .
"But you see , Diana , I feel myself responsible for the A.V.I.S. , since I was the first to suggest it , and it seems to me that I ought to do the most disagreeable things ."
"I should , I think , have had nothing left me to desire but for the eyes of the coxswain as they followed me derisively about the deck and the odd smile that appeared continually on his face ."
"It was a smile that had in it something both of pain and weakness -- a haggard old man 's smile ; but there was , besides that , a grain of derision , a shadow of treachery , in his expression as he craftily watched , and watched , and watched me at my work ."
"26 Israel Hands THE wind , serving us to a desire , now hauled into the west ."
We could run so much the easier from the north-east corner of the island to the mouth of the North Inlet .
"Only , as we had no power to anchor and dared not beach her till the tide had flowed a good deal farther , time hung on our hands ."
"The coxswain told me how to lay the ship to ; after a good many trials I succeeded , and we both sat in silence over another meal ."
"`` Cap'n , '' said he at length with that same uncomfortable smile , `` here 's my old shipmate , O'Brien ; s ` pose you was to heave him overboard ."
"I ai n't partic ` lar as a rule , and I do n't take no blame for settling his hash , but I do n't reckon him ornamental now , do you ? ''"
"`` I 'm not strong enough , and I do n't like the job ; and there he lies , for me , '' said I. `` This here 's an unlucky ship , this HISPANIOLA , Jim , '' he went on , blinking ."
`` There 's a power of men been killed in this HISPANIOLA -- a sight o ' poor seamen dead and gone since you and me took ship to Bristol .
"I never seen sich dirty luck , not I ."
"There was this here O'Brien now -- he 's dead , ai n't he ?"
"Well now , I 'm no scholar , and you 're a lad as can read and figure , and to put it straight , do you take it as a dead man is dead for good , or do he come alive again ? ''"
"`` You can kill the body , Mr. Hands , but not the spirit ; you must know that already , '' I replied ."
"`` O'Brien there is in another world , and may be watching us . ''"
`` Ah ! ''
says he .
"`` Well , that 's unfort ` nate -- appears as if killing parties was a waste of time ."
"Howsomever , sperrits do n't reckon for much , by what I 've seen ."
"I 'll chance it with the sperrits , Jim ."
"And now , you 've spoke up free , and I 'll take it kind if you 'd step down into that there cabin and get me a -- well , a -- shiver my timbers !"
"I ca n't hit the name on ` t ; well , you get me a bottle of wine , Jim -- this here brandy 's too strong for my head . ''"
"Now , the coxswain 's hesitation seemed to be unnatural , and as for the notion of his preferring wine to brandy , I entirely disbelieved it ."
The whole story was a pretext .
He wanted me to leave the deck -- so much was plain ; but with what purpose I could in no way imagine .
"His eyes never met mine ; they kept wandering to and fro , up and down , now with a look to the sky , now with a flitting glance upon the dead O'Brien ."
"All the time he kept smiling and putting his tongue out in the most guilty , embarrassed manner , so that a child could have told that he was bent on some deception ."
"I was prompt with my answer , however , for I saw where my advantage lay and that with a fellow so densely stupid I could easily conceal my suspicions to the end ."
`` Some wine ? ''
I said .
`` Far better .
Will you have white or red ? ''
"He was feeling stuffier and stuffier , and more and more wistful to learn what he wanted done to his nose , but he pursued them with the vital question in vain ; the timid creatures ran from him , and even the Lancers , when he approached them up the Hump , turned swiftly into a side-walk , on the pretence that they saw him there ."
"-LSB- Illustration : A band of workmen , who were sawing down a toadstool , rushed away , leaving their tools behind them -RSB- Despairing of the fairies , he resolved to consult the birds , but now he remembered , as an odd thing , that all the birds on the weeping-beech had flown away when he alighted on it , and though this had not troubled him at the time , he saw its meaning now ."
Every living thing was shunning him .
Poor little Peter Pan !
"he sat down and cried , and even then he did not know that , for a bird , he was sitting on his wrong part ."
"It is a blessing that he did not know , for otherwise he would have lost faith in his power to fly , and the moment you doubt whether you can fly , you cease for ever to be able to do it ."
"The reason birds can fly and we ca n't is simply that they have perfect faith , for to have faith is to have wings ."
"Now , except by flying , no one can reach the island in the Serpentine , for the boats of humans are forbidden to land there , and there are stakes round it , standing up in the water , on each of which a bird-sentinel sits by day and night ."
"It was to the island that Peter now flew to put his strange case before old Solomon Caw , and he alighted on it with relief , much heartened to find himself at last at home , as the birds call the island ."
"All of them were asleep , including the sentinels , except Solomon , who was wide awake on one side , and he listened quietly to Peter 's adventures , and then told him their true meaning ."
"` Look at your nightgown , if you do n't believe me , ' Solomon said ; and with staring eyes Peter looked at his nightgown , and then at the sleeping birds ."
Not one of them wore anything .
` How many of your toes are thumbs ? '
"said Solomon a little cruelly , and Peter saw , to his consternation , that all his toes were fingers ."
The shock was so great that it drove away his cold .
"` Ruffle your feathers , ' said that grim old Solomon , and Peter tried most desperately hard to ruffle his feathers , but he had none ."
"Then he rose up , quaking , and for the first time since he stood on the window ledge , he remembered a lady who had been very fond of him ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Put his strange case before old Solomon Caw -LRB- missing from book -RRB- -RSB- ' I think I shall go back to mother , ' he said , timidly ."
"` Good-bye , ' replied Solomon Caw with a queer look ."
But Peter hesitated .
` Why do n't you go ? '
the old one asked politely . '
"I suppose , ' said Peter huskily , ' I suppose I can still fly ? '"
You see he had lost faith .
` Poor little half-and-half ! '
"said Solomon , who was not really hard-hearted , ` you will never be able to fly again , not even on windy days ."
You must live here on the island always . '
` And never even go to the Kensington Gardens ? '
Peter asked tragically .
` How could you get across ? '
said Solomon .
"He promised very kindly , however , to teach Peter as many of the bird ways as could be learned by one of such an awkward shape ."
The door was opened almost at once by the maid .
`` Is Dr. Livesey in ? ''
I asked .
"No , she said , he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up to the hall to dine and pass the evening with the squire ."
"`` So there we go , boys , '' said Mr. Dance ."
"This time , as the distance was short , I did not mount , but ran with Dogger 's stirrup-leather to the lodge gates and up the long , leafless , moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on either hand on great old gardens ."
"Here Mr. Dance dismounted , and taking me along with him , was admitted at a word into the house ."
"The servant led us down a matted passage and showed us at the end into a great library , all lined with bookcases and busts upon the top of them , where the squire and Dr. Livesey sat , pipe in hand , on either side of a bright fire ."
I had never seen the squire so near at hand .
"He was a tall man , over six feet high , and broad in proportion , and he had a bluff , rough-and-ready face , all roughened and reddened and lined in his long travels ."
"His eyebrows were very black , and moved readily , and this gave him a look of some temper , not bad , you would say , but quick and high ."
"`` Come in , Mr. Dance , '' says he , very stately and condescending ."
"`` Good evening , Dance , '' says the doctor with a nod ."
"`` And good evening to you , friend Jim ."
What good wind brings you here ? ''
"The supervisor stood up straight and stiff and told his story like a lesson ; and you should have seen how the two gentlemen leaned forward and looked at each other , and forgot to smoke in their surprise and interest ."
"When they heard how my mother went back to the inn , Dr. Livesey fairly slapped his thigh , and the squire cried `` Bravo ! ''"
and broke his long pipe against the grate .
"Long before it was done , Mr. Trelawney -LRB- that , you will remember , was the squire 's name -RRB- had got up from his seat and was striding about the room , and the doctor , as if to hear the better , had taken off his powdered wig and sat there looking very strange indeed with his own close-cropped black poll ."
At last Mr. Dance finished the story .
"`` Mr. Dance , '' said the squire , `` you are a very noble fellow ."
"And as for riding down that black , atrocious miscreant , I regard it as an act of virtue , sir , like stamping on a cockroach ."
"This lad Hawkins is a trump , I perceive ."
"Hawkins , will you ring that bell ?"
Mr. Dance must have some ale . ''
"`` And so , Jim , '' said the doctor , `` you have the thing that they were after , have you ? ''"
"`` Here it is , sir , '' said I , and gave him the oilskin packet ."
"The doctor looked it all over , as if his fingers were itching to open it ; but instead of doing that , he put it quietly in the pocket of his coat ."
"`` Squire , '' said he , `` when Dance has had his ale he must , of course , be off on his Majesty 's service ; but I mean to keep Jim Hawkins here to sleep at my house , and with your permission , I propose we should have up the cold pie and let him sup . ''"
"`` As you will , Livesey , '' said the squire ; `` Hawkins has earned better than cold pie . ''"
"So a big pigeon pie was brought in and put on a sidetable , and I made a hearty supper , for I was as hungry as a hawk , while Mr. Dance was further complimented and at last dismissed ."
"`` And now , squire , '' said the doctor ."
"asked Sally , all impatience to begin ."
"`` Shut the lower draught of the stove , so that the oven may heat ."
"Then wash your hands and get out the flour , sugar , salt , butter , and cinnamon ."
"See if the pie-board is clean , and pare your apple ready to put in . ''"
"Daisy got things together with as little noise and spilling as could be expected , from so young a cook ."
"`` I really do n't know how to measure for such tiny pies ; I must guess at it , and if these do n't succeed , we must try again , '' said Mrs. Jo , looking rather perplexed , and very much amused with the small concern before her ."
"`` Take that little pan full of flour , put in a pinch of salt , and then rub in as much butter as will go on that plate ."
"Always remember to put your dry things together first , and then the wet ."
It mixes better so . ''
`` I know how ; I saw Asia do it .
Do n't I butter the pie plates too ?
"She did , the first thing , '' said Daisy , whisking the flour about at a great rate ."
`` Quite right !
"I do believe you have a gift for cooking , you take to it so cleverly , '' said Aunt Jo , approvingly ."
"`` Now a dash of cold water , just enough to wet it ; then scatter some flour on the board , work in a little , and roll the paste out ; yes , that 's the way ."
"Now put dabs of butter all over it , and roll it out again ."
"We wo n't have our pastry very rich , or the dolls will get dyspeptic . ''"
"Daisy laughed at the idea , and scattered the dabs with a liberal hand ."
"Then she rolled and rolled with her delightful little pin , and having got her paste ready proceeded to cover the plates with it ."
"Next the apple was sliced in , sugar and cinnamon lavishly sprinkled over it , and then the top crust put on with breathless care ."
"`` I always wanted to cut them round , and Asia never would let me ."
How nice it is to do it all my ownty donty self ! ''
"said Daisy , as the little knife went clipping round the doll 's plate poised on her hand ."
"All cooks , even the best , meet with mishaps sometimes , and Sally 's first one occurred then , for the knife went so fast that the plate slipped , turned a somersault in the air , and landed the dear little pie upside down on the floor ."
"Sally screamed , Mrs. Jo laughed , Teddy scrambled to get it , and for a moment confusion reigned in the new kitchen ."
"`` It did n't spill or break , because I pinched the edges together so hard ; it is n't hurt a bit , so I 'll prick holes in it , and then it will be ready , '' said Sally , picking up the capsized treasure and putting it into shape with a child-like disregard of the dust it had gathered in its fall ."
"`` My new cook has a good temper , I see , and that is such a comfort , '' said Mrs. Jo ."
"`` Now open the jar of strawberry jam , fill the uncovered pie , and put some strips of paste over the top as Asia does . ''"
"`` I 'll make a D in the middle , and have zigzags all round , that will be so interesting when I come to eat it , '' said Sally , loading the pie with quirls and flourishes that would have driven a real pastry cook wild ."
`` Now I put them in ! ''
"she exclaimed ; when the last grimy knob had been carefully planted in the red field of jam , and with an air of triumph she shut them into the little oven ."
`` Clear up your things ; a good cook never lets her utensils collect .
"I could not help wondering who it was that had `` got itt , '' and what `` itt '' was that he got ."
A knife in his back as like as not .
"`` Not much instruction there , '' said Dr. Livesey as he passed on ."
The next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious series of entries .
"There was a date at one end of the line and at the other a sum of money , as in common account-books , but instead of explanatory writing , only a varying number of crosses between the two ."
"On the 12th of June , 1745 , for instance , a sum of seventy pounds had plainly become due to someone , and there was nothing but six crosses to explain the cause ."
"In a few cases , to be sure , the name of a place would be added , as `` Offe Caraccas , '' or a mere entry of latitude and longitude , as `` 62o 17 ' 20 '' , 19o 2 ' 40 '' . ''"
"The record lasted over nearly twenty years , the amount of the separate entries growing larger as time went on , and at the end a grand total had been made out after five or six wrong additions , and these words appended , `` Bones , his pile . ''"
"`` I ca n't make head or tail of this , '' said Dr. Livesey ."
"`` The thing is as clear as noonday , '' cried the squire ."
`` This is the black-hearted hound 's account-book .
These crosses stand for the names of ships or towns that they sank or plundered .
"The sums are the scoundrel 's share , and where he feared an ambiguity , you see he added something clearer ."
"` Offe Caraccas , ' now ; you see , here was some unhappy vessel boarded off that coast ."
God help the poor souls that manned her -- coral long ago . ''
`` Right ! ''
said the doctor .
`` See what it is to be a traveller .
Right !
"And the amounts increase , you see , as he rose in rank . ''"
"There was little else in the volume but a few bearings of places noted in the blank leaves towards the end and a table for reducing French , English , and Spanish moneys to a common value ."
`` Thrifty man ! ''
cried the doctor .
`` He was n't the one to be cheated . ''
"`` And now , '' said the squire , `` for the other . ''"
"The paper had been sealed in several places with a thimble by way of seal ; the very thimble , perhaps , that I had found in the captain 's pocket ."
"The doctor opened the seals with great care , and there fell out the map of an island , with latitude and longitude , soundings , names of hills and bays and inlets , and every particular that would be needed to bring a ship to a safe anchorage upon its shores ."
"It was about nine miles long and five across , shaped , you might say , like a fat dragon standing up , and had two fine land-locked harbours , and a hill in the centre part marked `` The Spy-glass . ''"
"There were several additions of a later date , but above all , three crosses of red ink -- two on the north part of the island , one in the southwest -- and beside this last , in the same red ink , and in a small , neat hand , very different from the captain 's tottery characters , these words : `` Bulk of treasure here . ''"
"Over on the back the same hand had written this further information : Tall tree , Spy-glass shoulder , bearing a point to the N. of N.N.E. Skeleton Island E.S.E. and by E. Ten feet ."
"The bar silver is in the north cache ; you can find it by the trend of the east hummock , ten fathoms south of the black crag with the face on it ."
"The arms are easy found , in the sand-hill , N. point of north inlet cape , bearing E. and a quarter N. J.F. ."
"He often played ships at the Round Pond , but his ship was only a hoop which he had found on the grass ."
"Of course , he had never seen a hoop , and he wondered what you play at with them , and decided that you play at pretending they are boats ."
"This hoop always sank at once , but he waded in for it , and sometimes he dragged it gleefully round the rim of the pond , and he was quite proud to think that he had discovered what boys do with hoops ."
"Another time , when he found a child 's pail , he thought it was for sitting in , and he sat so hard in it that he could scarcely get out of it ."
Also he found a balloon .
"It was bobbing about on the Hump , quite as if it was having a game by itself , and he caught it after an exciting chase ."
"But he thought it was a ball , and Jenny Wren had told him that boys kick balls , so he kicked it ; and after that he could not find it anywhere ."
Perhaps the most surprising thing he found was a perambulator .
"It was under a lime-tree , near the entrance to the Fairy Queen 's Winter Palace -LRB- which is within the circle of the seven Spanish chestnuts -RRB- , and Peter approached it warily , for the birds had never mentioned such things to him ."
"Lest it was alive , he addressed it politely , and then , as it gave no answer , he went nearer and felt it cautiously ."
"He gave it a little push , and it ran from him , which made him think it must be alive after all ; but , as it had run from him , he was not afraid ."
"So he stretched out his hand to pull it to him , but this time it ran at him , and he was so alarmed that he leapt the railing and scudded away to his boat ."
"You must not think , however , that he was a coward , for he came back next night with a crust in one hand and a stick in the other , but the perambulator had gone , and he never saw another one ."
I have promised to tell you also about his paddle .
"It was a child 's spade which he had found near St. Govor 's Well , and he thought it was a paddle ."
Do you pity Peter Pan for making these mistakes ?
"If so , I think it rather silly of you ."
"What I mean is that , of course , one must pity him now and then , but to pity him all the time would be impertinence ."
"He thought he had the most splendid time in the Gardens , and to think you have it is almost quite as good as really to have it ."
"He played without ceasing , while you often waste time by being mad-dog or Mary-Annish ."
"He could be neither of these things , for he had never heard of them , but do you think he is to be pitied for that ?"
"Oh , he was merry ."
"He was as much merrier than you , for instance , as you are merrier than your father ."
"Sometimes he fell , like a spinning-top , from sheer merriment ."
Have you seen a greyhound leaping the fences of the Gardens ?
That is how Peter leaps them .
And think of the music of his pipe .
"Gentlemen who walk home at night write to the papers to say they heard a nightingale in the Gardens , but it is really Peter 's pipe they hear ."
"Of course , he had no mother -- at least , what use was she to him ?"
"You can be sorry for him for that , but do n't be too sorry , for the next thing I mean to tell you is how he revisited her ."
It was the fairies who gave him the chance .
"The Little House Everybody has heard of the Little House in the Kensington Gardens , which is the only house in the whole world that the fairies have built for humans ."
"Imagine , when we returned here , we met some linnets who , just as the spring and the flowers and the long days had come , were setting out for the north and the cold ?"
Out of pure compassion we tried to persuade them to give up this folly ; but they only replied with the utmost insolence . '
` How shocking ! '
exclaimed the city swallow .
"` Yes , it was ."
"And worse than that , the crested lark , that was formerly so timid and shy , is now no better than a thief , and steals maize and corn whenever she can find them . ' '"
I am astonished at what you say . '
` You will be more astonished when I tell you that on my arrival here for the summer I found my nest occupied by a shameless sparrow !
"`` This is my nest , '' I said ."
`` Yours ? ''
"he answered , with a rude laugh ."
"`` Yes , mine ; my ancestors were born here , and my sons will be born here also . ''"
And at that my husband set upon him and threw him out of the nest .
I am sure nothing of this sort ever happens in a town . '
"` Not exactly , perhaps ."
But I have seen a great deal -- if you only knew ! '
` Oh !
do tell us !
do tell us ! '
cried they all .
"And when they had settled themselves comfortably , the city swallow began : ` You must know , then that our king fell in love with the youngest daughter of a tailor , who was as good and gentle as she was beautiful ."
"His nobles hoped that he would have chosen a queen from one of their daughters , and tried to prevent the marriage ; but the king would not listen to them , and it took place ."
"Not many months later a war broke out , and the king rode away at the head of his army , while the queen remained behind , very unhappy at the separation ."
"When peace was made , and the king returned , he was told that his wife had had two babies in his absence , but that both were dead ; that she herself had gone out of her mind and was obliged to be shut up in a tower in the mountains , where , in time , the fresh air might cure her . '"
` And was this not true ? '
asked the swallows eagerly .
"` Of course not , ' answered the city lady , with some contempt for their stupidity ."
"` The children were alive at that very moment in the gardener 's cottage ; but at night the chamberlain came down and put them in a cradle of crystal , which he carried to the river ."
"` For a whole day they floated safely , for though the stream was deep it was very still , and the children took no harm ."
In the morning -- so I am told by my friend the kingfisher -- they were rescued by a fisherman who lived near the river bank . '
"The children had been lying on the bench , listening lazily to the chatter up to this point ; but when they heard the story of the crystal cradle which their foster-mother had always been fond of telling them , they sat upright and looked at each other ."
"` Oh , how glad I am I learnt the birds ' language ! '"
"` It is behind the oven , ' answered she ."
And again was silence .
"` Mother , dear mother , ' said the young man at last , ' I am almost afraid to ask you ; but I really have grown so stupid of late ."
Where did I hide my own money ? '
"But at this question the old woman flew into a passion , and vowed that if she could find a rod she would bring his memory back to him ."
"Luckily , no rod was within her reach , and the Sodno managed , after a little , to coax her back into good humour , and at length she told him that the youngest Stalo had buried his treasure under the very place where she was sitting ."
"` Dear mother , ' said Lyman , who had come in unseen , and was kneeling in front of the fire ."
"` Dear mother , do you know who it is you have been talking with ? '"
"The old woman started , but answered quietly : ` It is a Sodno , I suppose ? '"
"` You have guessed right , ' replied Lyma ."
"The mother of the Stalos looked round for her iron cane , which she always used to kill her victims , but it was not there , for Lyma had put it in the fire ."
` Where is my iron cane ? '
asked the old woman .
` There ! '
"answered Lyma , pointing to the flames ."
"The old woman sprang forwards and seized it , but her clothes caught fire , and in a few minutes she was burned to ashes ."
"So the Sodno brothers found the treasure , and they carried it , and their sister and the reindeer , to their own home , and were the richest men in all Lapland ."
"Andras Baive -LSB- From Lapplandische Marchen , J. C. Poestion . -RSB-"
Once upon a time there lived in Lapland a man who was so very strong and swift of foot that nobody in his native town of Vadso could come near him if they were running races in the summer evenings .
"The people of Vadso were very proud of their champion , and thought that there was no one like him in the world , till , by-and-by , it came to their ears that there dwelt among the mountains a Lapp , Andras Baive by name , who was said by his friends to be even stronger and swifter than the bailiff ."
"Of course not a creature in Vadso believed that , and declared that if it made the mountaineers happier to talk such nonsense , why , let them !"
"The winter was long and cold , and the thoughts of the villagers were much busier with wolves than with Andras Baive , when suddenly , on a frosty day , he made his appearance in the little town of Vadso ."
"The bailiff was delighted at this chance of trying his strength , and at once went out to seek Andras and to coax him into giving proof of his vigour ."
"As he walked along his eyes fell upon a big eight-oared boat that lay upon the shore , and his face shone with pleasure ."
"` That is the very thing , ' laughed he , ' I will make him jump over that boat . '"
"Andras was quite ready to accept the challenge , and they soon settled the terms of the wager ."
"He who could jump over the boat without so much as touching it with his heel was to be the winner , and would get a large sum of money as the prize ."
"So , followed by many of the villagers , the two men walked down to the sea ."
"An old fisherman was chosen to stand near the boat to watch fair play , and to hold the stakes , and Andras , as the stranger was told to jump first ."
"Going back to the flag which had been stuck into the sand to mark the starting place , he ran forward , with his head well thrown back , and cleared the boat with a mighty bound ."
"The lookers-on cheered him , and indeed he well deserve it ; but they waited anxiously all the same to see what the bailiff would do ."
"On he came , taller than Andras by several inches , but heavier of build ."
Perhaps the most surprising thing he found was a perambulator .
"It was under a lime-tree , near the entrance to the Fairy Queen 's Winter Palace -LRB- which is within the circle of the seven Spanish chestnuts -RRB- , and Peter approached it warily , for the birds had never mentioned such things to him ."
"Lest it was alive , he addressed it politely ; and then , as it gave no answer , he went nearer and felt it cautiously ."
"He gave it a little push , and it ran from him , which made him think it must be alive after all ; but , as it had run from him , he was not afraid ."
"So he stretched out his hand to pull it to him , but this time it ran at him , and he was so alarmed that he leapt the railing and scudded away to his boat ."
"You must not think , however , that he was a coward , for he came back next night with a crust in one hand and a stick in the other , but the perambulator had gone , and he never saw any other one ."
I have promised to tell you also about his paddle .
"It was a child 's spade which he had found near St. Govor 's Well , and he thought it was a paddle ."
Do you pity Peter Pan for making these mistakes ?
"If so , I think it rather silly of you ."
"What I mean is that , of course , one must pity him now and then , but to pity him all the time would be impertinence ."
"He thought he had the most splendid time in the Gardens , and to think you have it is almost quite as good as really to have it ."
"He played without ceasing , while you often waste time by being mad-dog or Mary-Annish ."
"He could be neither of these things , for he had never heard of them , but do you think he is to be pitied for that ?"
"Oh , he was merry !"
"He was as much merrier than you , for instance , as you are merrier than your father ."
"Sometimes he fell , like a spinning-top , from sheer merriment ."
Have you seen a greyhound leaping the fences of the Gardens ?
That is how Peter leaps them .
-LSB- Illustration : Fairies are all more or less in hiding until dusk -RSB- And think of the music of his pipe .
"Gentlemen who walk home at night write to the papers to say they heard a nightingale in the Gardens , but it is really Peter 's pipe they hear ."
"Of course , he had no mother -- at least , what use was she to him ?"
"You can be sorry for him for that , but do n't be too sorry , for the next thing I mean to tell you is how he revisited her ."
It was the fairies who gave him the chance .
"-LSB- Illustration : Tailpiece to ` The Thrush 's Nest ' -RSB- -LSB- Illustration : Headpiece to ` Lock-out Time ' -RSB- IV LOCK-OUT TIME It is frightfully difficult to know much about the fairies , and almost the only thing known for certain is that there are fairies wherever there are children ."
"Long ago children were forbidden the Gardens , and at that time there was not a fairy in the place ; then the children were admitted , and the fairies came trooping in that very evening ."
"They ca n't resist following the children , but you seldom see them , partly because they live in the daytime behind the railings , where you are not allowed to go , and also partly because they are so cunning ."
"They are not a bit cunning after Lock-out , but until Lock-out , my word !"
"-LSB- Illustration : They are so cunning -RSB- -LSB- Illustration : When they think you are not looking they skip along pretty lively -LRB- missing from book -RRB- -RSB- When you were a bird you knew the fairies pretty well , and you remember a good deal about them in your babyhood , which it is a great pity you ca n't write down , for gradually you forget , and I have heard of children who declared that they had never once seen a fairy ."
"Very likely if they said this in the Kensington Gardens , they were standing looking at a fairy all the time ."
The reason they were cheated was that she pretended to be something else .
This is one of their best tricks .
"Sharp as must have been his annoyance , Silver had the strength of mind to hide it ."
"`` Yes , sir , '' said he , `` this is the spot , to be sure , and very prettily drawed out ."
"Who might have done that , I wonder ?"
"The pirates were too ignorant , I reckon ."
"Aye , here it is : ` Capt. Kidd 's Anchorage ' -- just the name my shipmate called it ."
"There 's a strong current runs along the south , and then away nor ` ard up the west coast ."
"Right you was , sir , '' says he , `` to haul your wind and keep the weather of the island ."
"Leastways , if such was your intention as to enter and careen , and there ai n't no better place for that in these waters . ''"
"`` Thank you , my man , '' says Captain Smollett ."
`` I 'll ask you later on to give us a help .
You may go . ''
"I was surprised at the coolness with which John avowed his knowledge of the island , and I own I was half-frightened when I saw him drawing nearer to myself ."
"He did not know , to be sure , that I had overheard his council from the apple barrel , and yet I had by this time taken such a horror of his cruelty , duplicity , and power that I could scarce conceal a shudder when he laid his hand upon my arm ."
"`` Ah , '' says he , `` this here is a sweet spot , this island -- a sweet spot for a lad to get ashore on ."
"You 'll bathe , and you 'll climb trees , and you 'll hunt goats , you will ; and you 'll get aloft on them hills like a goat yourself ."
"Why , it makes me young again ."
"I was going to forget my timber leg , I was ."
"It 's a pleasant thing to be young and have ten toes , and you may lay to that ."
"When you want to go a bit of exploring , you just ask old John , and he 'll put up a snack for you to take along . ''"
"And clapping me in the friendliest way upon the shoulder , he hobbled off forward and went below ."
"Captain Smollett , the squire , and Dr. Livesey were talking together on the quarter-deck , and anxious as I was to tell them my story , I durst not interrupt them openly ."
"While I was still casting about in my thoughts to find some probable excuse , Dr. Livesey called me to his side ."
"He had left his pipe below , and being a slave to tobacco , had meant that I should fetch it ; but as soon as I was near enough to speak and not to be overheard , I broke immediately , `` Doctor , let me speak ."
"Get the captain and squire down to the cabin , and then make some pretence to send for me ."
I have terrible news . ''
"The doctor changed countenance a little , but next moment he was master of himself ."
"`` Thank you , Jim , '' said he quite loudly , `` that was all I wanted to know , '' as if he had asked me a question ."
And with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two .
"They spoke together for a little , and though none of them started , or raised his voice , or so much as whistled , it was plain enough that Dr. Livesey had communicated my request , for the next thing that I heard was the captain giving an order to Job Anderson , and all hands were piped on deck ."
"`` My lads , '' said Captain Smollett , `` I 've a word to say to you ."
This land that we have sighted is the place we have been sailing for .
"Mr. Trelawney , being a very open-handed gentleman , as we all know , has just asked me a word or two , and as I was able to tell him that every man on board had done his duty , alow and aloft , as I never ask to see it done better , why , he and I and the doctor are going below to the cabin to drink YOUR health and luck , and you 'll have grog served out for you to drink OUR health and luck ."
"If she said ` Peter ' again , he meant to cry ` Mother ' and run to her ."
"But she spoke no more , she made little moans only , and when he next peeped at her she was once more asleep , with tears on her face ."
"It made Peter very miserable , and what do you think was the first thing he did ?"
"Sitting on the rail at the foot of the bed , he played a beautiful lullaby to his mother on his pipe ."
"He had made it up himself out of the way she said ` Peter , ' and he never stopped playing until she looked happy ."
"He thought this so clever of him that he could scarcely resist wakening her to hear her say , ' O Peter , how exquisitely you play ! '"
"However , as she now seemed comfortable , he again cast looks at the window ."
You must not think that he meditated flying away and never coming back .
"He had quite decided to be his mother 's boy , but hesitated about beginning to-night ."
It was the second wish which troubled him .
"He no longer meant to make it a wish to be a bird , but not to ask for a second wish seemed wasteful , and , of course , he could not ask for it without returning to the fairies ."
"Also , if he put off asking for his wish too long it might go bad ."
He asked himself if he had not been hard-hearted to fly away without saying good-bye to Solomon . '
"I should like awfully to sail in my boat just once more , ' he said wistfully to his sleeping mother ."
He quite argued with her as if she could hear him .
"` It would be so splendid to tell the birds of this adventure , ' he said coaxingly . '"
"I promise to come back , ' he said solemnly , and meant it , too ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Butter is got from the roots of old trees -LRB- missing from book -RRB- -RSB- And in the end , you know , he flew away ."
"Twice he came back from the window , wanting to kiss his mother , but he feared the delight of it might waken her , so at last he played her a lovely kiss on his pipe , and then he flew back to the Gardens ."
"Many nights , and even months , passed before he asked the fairies for his second wish ; and I am not sure that I quite know why he delayed so long ."
"One reason was that he had so many good-byes to say , not only to his particular friends , but to a hundred favourite spots ."
"Then he had his last sail , and his very last sail , and his last sail of all , and so on ."
"Again , a number of farewell feasts were given in his honour ; and another comfortable reason was that , after all , there was no hurry , for his mother would never weary of waiting for him ."
"This last reason displeased old Solomon , for it was an encouragement to the birds to procrastinate ."
"Solomon had several excellent mottoes for keeping them at their work , such as ` Never put off laying to-day because you can lay to-morrow , ' and ` In this world there are no second chances , ' and yet here was Peter gaily putting off and none the worse for it ."
"The birds pointed this out to each other , and fell into lazy habits ."
"But , mind you , though Peter was so slow in going back to his mother , he was quite decided to go back ."
The best proof of this was his caution with the fairies .
"They were most anxious that he should remain in the Gardens to play to them , and to bring this to pass they tried to trick him into making such a remark as ' I wish the grass was not so wet , ' and some of them danced out of time in the hope that he might cry , ' I do wish you would keep time ! '"
Then they would have said that this was his second wish .
"But he smoked their design , and though on occasions he began , ' I wish -- ' he always stopped in time ."
"So when at last he said to them bravely , ' I wish now to go back to mother for ever and always , ' they had to tickle his shoulders and let him go ."
"That day the cows wandered father than ever they had done before , and never stopped till they had reached a moor where the heather was burning ."
"The fire was fierce , but the cows took no heed , and walked steadily through it , Covan the Brown-haired following them ."
"Next they plunged into a foaming river , and Covan plunged in after them , though the water came high above his waist ."
"On the other side of the river lay a wide plain , and here the cows lay down , while Covan looked about him ."
"Near him was a house built of yellow stone , and from it came sweet songs , and Covan listened , and his heart grew light within him ."
"While he was thus waiting there ran up to him a youth , scarcely able to speak so swiftly had he sped ; and he cried aloud : ` Hasten , hasten , Covan the Brown-haired , for your cows are in the corn , and you must drive them out ! '"
"` Nay , ' said Covan smiling , ` it had been easier for you to have driven them out than to come here to tell me . '"
And he went on listening to the music .
"Very soon the same youth returned and cried with panting breath : ` Out upon you , Covan son of Gorla , that you stand there agape ."
"For our dogs are chasing your cows , and you must drive them off ! '"
"` Nay , then , ' answered Covan as before , ` it had been easier for you to call off your dogs than to come here to tell me . '"
And he stayed where he was till the music ceased .
"Then he turned to look for the cows , and found them all lying in the place where he had left them ; but when they saw Covan they rose up and walked homewards , taking a different path to that they had trod in the morning ."
"This time they passed over a plain so bare that a pin could not have lain there unnoticed , yet Covan beheld with surprise a foal and its mother feeding there , both as fat as if they had pastured on the richest grass ."
"Further on they crossed another plain , where the grass was thick and green , but on it were feeding a foal and its mother , so lean that you could have counted their ribs ."
"And further again the path led them by the shores of a lake whereon were floating two boats ; one full of gay and happy youths , journeying to the land of the Sun , and another with grim shapes clothed in black , travelling to the land of Night ."
` What can these things mean ? '
"said Covan to himself , as he followed his cows ."
"Darkness now fell , the wind howled , and torrents of rain poured upon them ."
"Covan knew not how far they might yet have to go , or indeed if they were on the right road ."
"He could not even see his cows , and his heart sank lest , after all , he should have failed to bring them safely back ."
What was he to do ?
"He waited thus , for he could go neither forwards nor backwards , till he felt a great friendly paw laid on his shoulder ."
"` My cave is just here , ' said the Dog of Maol-mor , of whom Covan son of Gorla had heard much ."
"` Spend the night here , and you shall be fed on the flesh of lamb , and shall lay aside three-thirds of thy weariness . '"
"And Covan entered , and supped , and slept , and in the morning rose up a new man ."
"` Farewell , Covan , ' said the Dog of Maol-mor ."
"` May success go with you , for you took what I had to give and did not mock me ."
"So , when danger is your companion , wish for me , and I will not fail you . '"
"At these words the Dog of Maol-mor disappeared into the forest , and Covan went to seek his cows , which were standing in the hollow where the darkness had come upon them ."
"At the sight of Covan the Brown-haired they walked onwards , Covan following ever behind them , and looking neither to the right nor to the left ."
"All that day they walked , and when night fell they were in a barren plain , with only rocks for shelter ."
He signed to them not to give vent to any cry of admiration that might rouse suspicion .
Then he went on ticking .
Chapter 15 `` HOOK OR ME THIS TIME '' Odd things happen to all of us on our way through life without our noticing for a time that they have happened .
"Thus , to take an instance , we suddenly discover that we have been deaf in one ear for we do n't know how long , but , say , half an hour ."
Now such an experience had come that night to Peter .
When last we saw him he was stealing across the island with one finger to his lips and his dagger at the ready .
"He had seen the crocodile pass by without noticing anything peculiar about it , but by and by he remembered that it had not been ticking ."
"At first he thought this eerie , but soon concluded rightly that the clock had run down ."
"Without giving a thought to what might be the feelings of a fellow-creature thus abruptly deprived of its closest companion , Peter began to consider how he could turn the catastrophe to his own use ; and he decided to tick , so that wild beasts should believe he was the crocodile and let him pass unmolested ."
"He ticked superbly , but with one unforeseen result ."
"The crocodile was among those who heard the sound , and it followed him , though whether with the purpose of regaining what it had lost , or merely as a friend under the belief that it was again ticking itself , will never be certainly known , for , like slaves to a fixed idea , it was a stupid beast ."
"Peter reached the shore without mishap , and went straight on , his legs encountering the water as if quite unaware that they had entered a new element ."
"Thus many animals pass from land to water , but no other human of whom I know ."
As he swam he had but one thought : `` Hook or me this time . ''
He had ticked so long that he now went on ticking without knowing that he was doing it .
"Had he known he would have stopped , for to board the brig by help of the tick , though an ingenious idea , had not occurred to him ."
"On the contrary , he thought he had scaled her side as noiseless as a mouse ; and he was amazed to see the pirates cowering from him , with Hook in their midst as abject as if he had heard the crocodile ."
The crocodile !
No sooner did Peter remember it than he heard the ticking .
"At first he thought the sound did come from the crocodile , and he looked behind him swiftly ."
"Then he realised that he was doing it himself , and in a flash he understood the situation ."
`` How clever of me ! ''
"he thought at once , and signed to the boys not to burst into applause ."
It was at this moment that Ed Teynte the quartermaster emerged from the forecastle and came along the deck .
"Now , reader , time what happened by your watch ."
Peter struck true and deep .
John clapped his hands on the ill-fated pirate 's mouth to stifle the dying groan .
He fell forward .
Four boys caught him to prevent the thud .
"Peter gave the signal , and the carrion was cast overboard ."
"There was a splash , and then silence ."
How long has it taken ?
"The fight lasted all day , and the prince 's strength was well-nigh spent , when the dragon , thinking that the victory was won , opened his jaws to give a roar of triumph ."
"The prince saw his chance , and before his foe could shut his mouth again had plunged his sword far down his adversary 's throat ."
"There was a desperate clutching of the claws to the earth , a slow flagging of the great wings , then the monster rolled over on his side and moved no more ."
Muffette was delivered .
After this they all went back to the palace .
"The marriage took place the following day , and Muffette and her husband lived happy for ever after ."
"The Adventures of Covan the Brown-Haired -LSB- From Les Contes des Fees , par Madame d'Aulnoy . -RSB-"
"On the shores of the west , where the great hills stand with their feet in the sea , dwelt a goatherd and his wife , together with their three sons and one daughter ."
"All day long the young men fished and hunted , while their sister took out the kids to pasture on the mountain , or stayed at home helping her mother and mending the nets ."
"For several years they all lived happily together , when one day , as the girl was out on the hill with the kids , the sun grew dark and an air cold as a thick white mist came creeping , creeping up from the sea ."
"She rose with a shiver , and tried to call to her kids , but the voice died away in her throat , and strong arms seemed to hold her ."
Loud were the wails in the hut by the sea when the hours passed on and the maiden came not .
"Many times the father and brothers jumped up , thinking they heard her steps , but in the thick darkness they could scarcely see their own hands , nor could they tell where the river lay , nor where the mountain ."
"One by one the kids came home , and at every bleat someone hurried to open the door , but no sound broke the stillness ."
"Through the night no one slept , and when morning broke and the mist rolled back , they sought the maiden by sea and by land , but never a trace of her could be found anywhere ."
"Thus a year and a day slipped by , and at the end of it Gorla of the Flocks and his wife seemed suddenly to have grown old ."
"Their sons too were sadder than before , for they loved their sister well , and had never ceased to mourn for her ."
"At length Ardan the eldest spoke and said : ` It is now a year and a day since our sister was taken from us , and we have waited in grief and patience for her to return ."
"Surely some evil has befallen her , or she would have sent us a token to put our hearts at rest ; and I have vowed to myself that my eyes shall not know sleep till , living or dead , I have found her . '"
"` If you have vowed , then must you keep your vow , ' answered Gorla ."
` But better had it been if you had first asked your father 's leave before you made it .
"Yet , since it is so , your mother will bake you a cake for you to carry with you on your journey ."
Who can tell how long it may be ? '
"So the mother arose and baked not one cake but two , a big one and a little one ."
"` Choose , my son , ' said she ."
"` Will you have the little cake with your mother 's blessing , or the big one without it , in that you have set aside your father and taken on yourself to make a vow ? ' '"
"I will have the large cake , ' answered the youth ; ` for what good would my mother 's blessing do for me if I was dying of hunger ? '"
And taking the big cake he went his way .
"Straight on he strode , letting neither hill nor river hinder him ."
Swiftly he walked -- swiftly as the wind that blew down the mountain .
"The eagles and the gulls looked on from their nests as he passed , leaving the deer behind him ; but at length he stopped , for hunger had seized on him , and he could walk no more ."
Trembling with fatigue he sat himself on a rock and broke a piece off his cake .
"By these and many other tricks he soon became so celebrated that his fame reached the king 's ears , and his majesty was filled with curiosity to see the man who had managed to outwit everybody ."
So he commanded his guards to capture the young man and bring him before him .
"And when the young man stood before the king , the king spoke to him and said , ` By your tricks and the pranks that you have played on other people , you have , in the eye of the law , forfeited your life ."
"But on one condition I will spare you , and that is , if you will bring me the flying horse that belongs to the great dragon ."
"Fail in this , and you shall be hewn in a thousand pieces . '"
"` If that is all , ' said the youth , ` you shall soon have it . '"
So he went out and made his way straight to the stable where the flying horse was tethered .
"He stretched his hand cautiously out to seize the bridle , when the horse suddenly began to neigh as loud as he could ."
"Now the room in which the dragon slept was just above the stable , and at the sound of the neighing he woke and cried to the horse , ` What is the matter , my treasure ?"
is anything hurting you ? '
"After waiting a little while the young man tried again to loose the horse , but a second time it neighed so loudly that the dragon woke up in a hurry and called out to know why the horse was making such a noise ."
"But when the same thing happened the third time , the dragon lost his temper , and went down into the stable and took a whip and gave the horse a good beating ."
"This offended the horse and made him angry , and when the young man stretched out his hand to untie his head , he made no further fuss , but suffered himself to be led quietly away ."
"Once clear of the stable the young man sprang on his back and galloped off , calling over his shoulder , ` Hi !"
dragon !
dragon !
"if anyone asks you what has become of your horse , you can say that I have got him ! '"
"But the king said , ` The flying horse is all very well , but I want something more ."
"You must bring me the covering with the little bells that lies on the bed of the dragon , or I will have you hewn into a thousand pieces . '"
` Is that all ? '
answered the youth .
` That is easily done . '
And when night came he went away to the dragon 's house and climbed up on to the roof .
"Then he opened a little window in the roof and let down the chain from which the kettle usually hung , and tried to hook the bed covering and to draw it up ."
"But the little bells all began to ring , and the dragon woke and said to his wife , ` Wife , you have pulled off all the bed-clothes ! '"
"and drew the covering towards him , pulling , as he did so , the young man into the room ."
"Then the dragon flung himself on the youth and bound him fast with cords saying as he tied the last knot , ` To-morrow when I go to church you must stay at home and kill him and cook him , and when I get back we will eat him together . '"
So the following morning the dragoness took hold of the young man and reached down from the shelf a sharp knife with which to kill him .
"But as she untied the cords the better to get hold of him , the prisoner caught her by the legs , threw her to the ground , seized her and speedily cut her throat , just as she had been about to do for him , and put her body in the oven ."
Then he snatched up the covering and carried it to the king .
The king was seated on his throne when the youth appeared before him and spread out the covering with a deep bow .
"` That is not enough , ' said his majesty ; ` you must bring me the dragon himself , or I will have you hewn into a thousand pieces . '"
"""All one to me,"" said the lad, ""I'd be just as glad to hear he had four heads beside; I'd like to see what kind of fellow he is. As for going, I won't go at all. I've done no harm; but meat you must get me, for I'm almost starved to death."""
"When Halvor had eaten his fill, the Princess told him to try if he could brandish the sword that hung against the wall; no, he couldn't brandish it, he couldn't even lift it up."
"""Oh!"" said the Princess, ""now you must go and take a pull of that flask that hangs by its side; that's what the Troll does every time he goes out to use the sword."""
"So Halvor took a pull, and in the twinkling of an eye he could brandish the sword like nothing; and now he thought it high time the Troll came; and lo! just then up came the Troll puffing and blowing. Halvor jumped behind the door."
"""HUTETU,"" said the Troll, as he put his head in at the door, ""what a smell of Christian man's blood!"""
"""Aye,"" said Halvor, ""you'll soon know that to your cost,"" and with that he hewed off all his heads."
"Now the Princess was so glad that she was free, she both danced and sang, but then all at once she called her sisters to mind, and so she said:"
"""Would my sisters were free too!"""
"""Where are they?"" asked Halvor."
"Well, she told him all about it; one was taken away by a Troll to his Castle which lay fifty miles off, and the other by another Troll to his Castle which was fifty miles further still."
"""But now,"" she said, ""you must first help me to get this ugly carcass out of the house."""
"Yes, Halvor was so strong he swept everything away, and made it all clean and tidy in no time. So they had a good and happy time of it, and next morning he set off at peep of grey dawn; he could take no rest by the way, but ran and walked the whole day. When he first saw the Castle he got a little afraid; it was far grander than the first, but here too there wasn't a living soul to be seen. So Halvor went into the kitchen, and didn't stop there either, but went straight further on into the house."
"""Nay, nay,"" called out the Princess, ""dare Christian folk come hither? I don't know I'm sure how long it is since I came here, but in all that time I haven't seen a Christian man. 'Twere best you saw how to get away as fast as you came; for here lives a Troll who has six heads."""
"""I shan't go,"" said Halvor, ""if he has six heads besides."""
"""He'll take you up and swallow you down alive,"" said the Princess."
"But it was no good, Halvor wouldn't go; he wasn't at all afraid of the Troll, but meat and drink he must have, for he was half starved after his long journey. Well, he got as much of that as he wished, but then the Princess wanted him to be off again."
"""No,"" said Halvor, ""I won't go, I've done no harm, and I've nothing to be afraid about."""
"""He won't stay to ask that,"" said the Princess, ""for he'll take you without law or leave; but as you won't go, just try if you can brandish that sword yonder, which the Troll wields in war."""
"He couldn't brandish it, and then the Princess said he must take a pull at the flask which hung by its side, and when he had done that he could brandish it."
"Just then back came the Troll, and he was both stout and big, so that he had to go sideways to get through the door. When the Troll got his first head in he called out:"
"""HUTETU, what a smell of Christian man's blood!"""
"But that very moment Halvor hewed off his first head, and so on all the rest as they popped in. The Princess was overjoyed, but just then she came to think of her sisters, and wished out loud they were free. Halvor thought that might easily be done, and wanted to be off at once; but first he had to help the Princess to get the Troll's carcass out of the way, and so he could only set out next morning."
"It was a long way to the Castle, and he had to walk fast and run hard to reach it in time; but about nightfall he saw the Castle, which was far finer and grander than either of the others. This time he wasn't the least afraid, but walked straight through the kitchen, and into the Castle. There sat a Princess who was so pretty, there was no end to her loveliness. She too like the others told him there hadn't been Christian folk there ever since she came thither, and bade him go away again, else the Troll would swallow him alive, and do you know, she said, he has nine heads."
"""Aye, aye,"" said Halvor, ""if he had nine other heads, and nine other heads still, I won't go away,"" and so he stood fast before the stove."
"The Princess kept on begging him so prettily to go away, lest the Troll should gobble him up, but Halvor said:"
"""Let him come as soon as he likes."""
"So she gave him the Troll's sword, and bade him take a pull at the flask, that he might be able to brandish and wield it."
Just then back came the Troll puffing and blowing and tearing along.
"He was far bigger and stouter than the other two, and he too had to go on one side to get through the door. So when he got his first head in, he said as the others had said:"
"""HUTETU, what a smell of Christian man's blood!"""
"That very moment Halvor hewed off the first head and then all the rest; but the last was the toughest of them all, and it was the hardest bit of work Halvor had to do, to get it hewn off, although he knew very well he had strength enough to do it."
"So all the Princesses came together to that Castle, which was called Soria Moria Castle, and they were glad and happy as they had never been in all their lives before, and they all were fond of Halvor and Halvor of them, and he might choose the one he liked best for his bride; but the youngest was fondest of him of all the three."
The Fairy Flower
And she held the little Rabbit close in her arms and flew with him into the wood.
"It was light now, for the moon had risen. All the forest was beautiful, and the fronds of the bracken shone like frosted silver. In the open glade between the tree-trunks the wild rabbits danced with their shadows on the velvet grass, but when they saw the Fairy they all stopped dancing and stood round in a ring to stare at her."
"""I've brought you a new playfellow,"" the Fairy said. ""You must be very kind to him and teach him all he needs to know in Rabbit-land, for he is going to live with you for ever and ever!"""
And she kissed the little Rabbit again and put him down on the grass.
"""Run and play, little Rabbit!"" she said."
But the little Rabbit sat quite still for a moment and never moved.
"For when he saw all the wild rabbits dancing around him he suddenly remembered about his hind legs, and he didn't want them to see that he was made all in one piece. He did not know that when the Fairy kissed him that last time she had changed him altogether. And he might have sat there a long time, too shy to move, if just then something hadn't tickled his nose, and before he thought what he was doing he lifted his hind toe to scratch it."
"And he found that he actually had hind legs! Instead of dingy velveteen he had brown fur, soft and shiny, his ears twitched by themselves, and his whiskers were so long that they brushed the grass."
"He gave one leap and the joy of using those hind legs was so great that he went springing about the turf on them, jumping sideways and whirling round as the others did, and he grew so excited that when at last he did stop to look for the Fairy she had gone."
"He was a Real Rabbit at last, at home with the other rabbits."
At Last! At Last!
"Autumn passed and Winter, and in the Spring, when the days grew warm and sunny, the Boy went out to play in the wood behind the house. And while he was playing, two rabbits crept out from the bracken and peeped at him. One of them was brown all over, but the other had strange markings under his fur, as though long ago he had been spotted, and the spots still showed through. And about his little soft nose and his round black eyes there was something familiar, so that the Boy thought to himself:"
"""Why, he looks just like my old Bunny that was lost when I had scarlet fever!"""
"But he never knew that it really was his own Bunny, come back to look at the child who had first helped him to be Real."

I. The Book of Beasts
"He happened to be building a Palace when the news came, and he left all the bricks kicking about the floor for Nurse to clear up but then the news was rather remarkable news. You see, there was a knock at the front door and voices talking downstairs, and Lionel thought it was the man come to see about the gas, which had not been allowed to be lighted since the day when Lionel made a swing by tying his skipping rope to the gas bracket."
"And then, quite suddenly, Nurse came in and said, ""Master Lionel, dear, they've come to fetch you to go and be King."""
"Then she made haste to change his smock and to wash his face and hands and brush his hair, and all the time she was doing it Lionel kept wriggling and fidgeting and saying, ""Oh, don't, Nurse,"" and, ""I'm sure my ears are quite clean,"" or, ""Never mind my hair, it's all right,"" and, ""That'll do."""
"""You're going on as if you was going to be an eel instead of a King,"""
said Nurse.
"The minute Nurse let go for a moment Lionel bolted off without waiting for his clean handkerchief, and in the drawing room there were two very grave-looking gentlemen in red robes with fur, and gold coronets with velvet sticking up out of the middle like the cream in the very expensive jam tarts."
"They bowed low to Lionel, and the gravest one said: ""Sire, your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, the King of this country, is dead, and now you have got to come and be King."""
"""Yes, please, sir,"" said Lionel, ""when does it begin?"""
"""You will be crowned this afternoon,"" said the grave gentleman who was not quite so grave-looking as the other."
"""Would you like me to bring Nurse, or what time would you like me to be fetched, and hadn't I better put on my velvet suit with the lace collar?"" said Lionel, who had often been out to tea."
"""Your Nurse will be removed to the Palace later. No, never mind about changing your suit; the Royal robes will cover all that up."""
"The grave gentlemen led the way to a coach with eight white horses, which was drawn up in front of the house where Lionel lived. It was No."
"7, on the left-hand side of the street as you go up."
"Once he was hard pressed for means, as he was trying to run a farm, and running a farm costs money: so he went to a bank to borrow. He hated to do it, because he had no special inducements to offer a bank or to make it hilariously loan him money."
"""How much did you think you would need, Mr. Webster?"" asked the President, cutting off some coupons as he spoke and making paper dolls of them."
"""Well, I could get along very well,"" said Webster, in that deep, resinous voice of his, ""if I could have two thousand dollars."""
"""Well, you remember,"" said the banker, ""do you not, that you have two thousand dollars here, that you deposited five years ago, after you had dined with the Governor of North Carolina?"""
"""No, I had forgotten about that,"" said Webster. ""Give me a blank check without unnecessary delay."""
We may learn from this that Mr. Webster was not a careful man in the matter of detail.
"His speech on the two-hundredth anniversary of the landing of the Pilgrims was a good thing, and found its way into the press of the time."
"His speech at the laying of the corner-stone of the Bunker Hill Monument, and his eulogy of Adams and Jefferson, were beautiful and thrilling."
"Daniel Webster had a very large brain, and used to loan his hat to brother Senators now and then when their heads were paining them, provided he did not want it himself."
"His reply to Robert Y. Hayne, of South Carolina, in 1830, was regarded as one of his ablest parliamentary efforts. Hayne attacked New England, and first advanced the doctrine of nullification, which was even more dangerous than secession, Jefferson Davis in 1860 denying that he had ever advocated or favored such a doctrine."
"Webster spoke extempore, and people sent out for their lunch rather than go away in the midst of his remarks."
"Webster married twice, but did not let that make any difference with his duty to his country."
"He tried to farm it some, but did not amass a large sum, owing to his heavy losses in trying year after year to grow Saratoga potatoes for the Boston market."
"No American, foreign or domestic, ever made a greater name for himself than Daniel Webster, but he was not so good a penman as Noah; Noah was the better pen-writer."
"Noah Webster also had the better command of language of the two. Those who have read his great work entitled ""Webster's Elementary Spelling-Book, or, How One Word Led to Another,"" will agree with me that he was smart. Noah never lacked for a word by which to express himself."
He was a brainy man and a good speller.
One by one our eminent men are passing away. Mr. Webster has passed away; Napoleon Bonaparte is no more; and Dr. Mary Walker is fading away.
This has been a severe winter on Red Shirt; and I have to guard against the night air a good deal myself.
"It would ill become me, at this late date, to criticise Mr. Webster's work, a work that is now, I may say, in nearly every home and school-room in the land. It is a great book. I only hope that had Mr."
Webster lived he would have been equally fair in his criticism of my books.
"I hate to compare my books with Mr. Webster's, because it looks egotistical in me; but, although Noah's book is larger than mine, and has more literary attractions as a book to set a child on at the table, it does not hold the interest of the reader all the way through."
"He has introduced too many characters into his book at the expense of the plot. It is a good book to pick up and while away a leisure hour, perhaps, but it is not a work that could rivet your interest till midnight, while the fire went out and the thermometer stepped down to 47° below zero. You do not hurry through the pages to see whether Reginald married the girl or not. Mr. Webster did not seem to care how the affair turned out."
"Therein consists the great difference between Noah and myself. He doesn't keep up the interest. A friend of mine at Sing Sing, who secured one of my books, said he never left his room till he had devoured it. He said he seemed chained to the spot; and if you can't believe a convict who is entirely out of politics, whom, in the name of George Washington, can you trust?"
"Mr. Webster was certainly a most brilliant writer, though a little inclined, perhaps, to be wordy. I have discovered in some of his later books one hundred and eighteen thousand words no two of which are alike."
"This shows great fluency and versatility, it is true, but we need something else. The reader waits in vain to be thrilled by the author's wonderful word-painting. There is not a thrill in the whole tome."
"I had heard so much of Mr. Webster that when I read his book I confess I was disappointed. It is cold, methodical, dry, and dispassionate in the extreme, and one cannot help comparing it with the works of James Fenimore Cooper and Horace."
"As I said, however, it is a good book to pick up for the purpose of whiling away an idle hour. No one should travel without Mr. Webster's tale. Those who examine this tale will readily see why there were no flies on the author. He kept them off with this tale."
"It is a good book, as I say, to take up for a moment, or to read on the train, or to hold the door open on a hot day. I would never take a long railroad ride without it, eyether. I would as soon forget my bottle of cough-medicine."
"Mr. Webster's Speller had an immense sale. Ten years ago he had sold forty million copies. And yet it had this same defect. It was cold, dull, disconnected, and verbose. There was only one good thing in the book, and that was a little literary gem regarding a boy who broke in and stole the apples of a total stranger. The story was so good that I have often wondered whom Mr. Webster got to write it for him."
"The old man, it seems, at first told the boy that he had better come down, as there was a draught in the tree; but the young sass-box apple-sass-box, I presume told him to avaunt."
"But there after a while, Halvor went about, and was so strange and dull and silent. Then the Princesses asked him what he lacked, and if he didn't like to live with them any longer? Yes, he did, for they had enough and to spare, and he was well off in every way, but still somehow or other he did so long to go home, for his father and mother were alive, and them he had such a great wish to see."
"Well, they thought that might be done easily enough."
"""You shall go thither and come back hither, safe and unscathed, if you will only follow our advice,"" said the Princesses."
"Yes, he'd be sure to mind all they said. So they dressed him up till he was as grand as a king's son, and then they set a ring on his finger, and that was such a ring, he could wish himself thither and hither with it; but they told him to be sure and not take it off, and not to name their names, for there would be an end of all his bravery, and then he'd never see them more."
"""If I only stood at home I'd be glad,"" said Halvor; and it was done as he had wished. Then stood Halvor at his father's cottage door before he knew a word about it. Now it was about dusk at even, and so, when they saw such a grand stately lord walk in, the old couple got so afraid they began to bow and scrape. Then Halvor asked if he couldn't stay there, and have a lodging there that night. No; that he couldn't."
"""We can't do it at all,"" they said, ""for we haven't this thing or that thing which such a lord is used to have; 'twere best your lordship went up to the farm, no long way off, for you can see the chimneys, and there they have lots of everything."""
"Halvor wouldn't hear of it he wanted to stop; but the old couple stuck to their own, that he had better go to the farmer's; there he would get both meat and drink; as for them, they hadn't even a chair to offer him to sit down on."
"""No,"" said Halvor, ""I won't go up there till to-morrow early, but let me just stay here to-night; worst come to the worst, I can sit in the chimney corner."""
"Well, they couldn't say anything against that; so Halvor sat down by the ingle, and began to poke about in the ashes, just as he used to do when he lay at home in old days, and stretched his lazy bones."
"Well, they chattered and talked about many things; and they told Halvor about this thing and that; and so he asked them if they had never had any children."
"Yes, yes, they had once a lad whose name was Halvor, but they didn't know whither he had wandered; they couldn't even tell whether he were dead or alive."
"""Couldn't it be me, now?"" said Halvor."
"""Let me see; I could tell him well enough,"" said the old wife, and rose up. ""Our Halvor was so lazy and dull, he never did a thing; and besides, he was so ragged, that one tatter took hold of the next tatter on him. No; there never was the making of such a fine fellow in him as you are, master."""
"A little while after the old wife went to the hearth to poke up the fire, and when the blaze fell on Halvor's face, just as when he was at home of old poking about in the ashes, she knew him at once."
"""Ah! but it is you after all, Halvor?"" she cried; and then there was such joy for the old couple, there was no end to it; and he was forced to tell how he had fared, and the old dame was so fond and proud of him, nothing would do but he must go up at once to the farmer's, and show himself to the lassies, who had always looked down on him. And off she went first, and Halvor followed after. So, when she got up there, she told them all how Halvor had come home again, and now they should only just see how grand he was, for, said she, ""he looks like nothing but a King's son."""
"""All very fine,"" said the lassies, and tossed up their heads. ""We'll be bound he's just the same beggarly ragged boy he always was."""
"Just then in walked Halvor, and then the lassies were all so taken aback, they forgot their sarks in the ingle, where they were sitting darning their clothes, and ran out in their smocks. Well, when they were got back again, they were so shamefaced they scarce dared look at Halvor, towards whom they had always been proud and haughty."
"""Aye, aye,"" said Halvor, ""you always thought yourselves so pretty and neat, no one could come near you; but now you should just see the eldest Princess I have set free; against her you look just like milkmaids, and the midmost is prettier still; but the youngest, who is my sweetheart, she's fairer than both sun and moon. Would to Heaven they were only here,"" said Halvor, ""then you'd see what you would see."""
"He had scarce uttered these words before there they stood, but then he felt so sorry, for now what they had said came into his mind. Up at the farm there was a great feast got ready for the Princesses, and much was made of them, but they wouldn't stop there."
"""No, we want to go down to your father and mother,"" they said to Halvor; ""and so we'll go out now and look about us."""
"So he went down with them, and they came to a great lake just outside the farm. Close by the water was such a lovely green bank; here the Princesses said they would sit and rest a while; they thought it so sweet to sit down and look over the water."
"So they sat down there, and when they had sat a while the youngest Princess said:"
"""I may as well comb your hair a little, Halvor."""
"Well, Halvor laid his head on her lap, and she combed his bonny locks, and it wasn't long before Halvor fell fast asleep. Then she took the ring from his finger, and put another in its stead; and she said:"
"""Now hold me all together! and now would we were all in Soria Moria Castle."""
"So when Halvor woke up, he could very well tell that he had lost the Princesses, and began to weep and wail; and he was so downcast, they couldn't comfort him at all. In spite of all his father and mother said, he wouldn't stop there, but took farewell of them, and said he was safe not to see them again; for if he couldn't find the Princesses again, he thought it not worth while to live."
"Well, he had still about sixty pounds left, so he put them into his pocket, and set out on his way. So, when he had walked a while, he met a man with a tidy horse, and he wanted to buy it, and began to chaffer with the man."
"""Aye,"" said the man, ""to tell the truth, I never thought of selling him; but if we could strike a bargain perhaps """
"""What do you want for him?"" asked Halvor."
"""I didn't give much for him, nor is he worth much; he's a brave horse to ride, but he can't draw at all; still he's strong enough to carry your knapsack and you too, turn and turn about,"" said the man."
"At last they agreed on the price, and Halvor laid the knapsack on him, and so he walked a bit, and rode a bit, turn and turn about. At night he came to a green plain where stood a great tree, at the roots of which he sat down. There he let the horse loose, but he didn't lie down to sleep, but opened his knapsack and took a meal. At peep of day off he set again, for he could take no rest. So he rode and walked and walked and rode the whole day through the wide wood, where there were so many green spots and glades that shone so bright and lovely between the trees. He didn't know at all where he was or whither he was going, but he gave himself no more time to rest than when his horse cropped a bit of grass, and he took a snack out of his knapsack when they came to one of those green glades. So he went on walking and riding by turns, and as for the wood there seemed to be no end to it."
But at dusk the next day he saw a light gleaming away through the trees.
"The clerk, however, was standing behind the altar and heard that, so he cried in a very gruff voice, “Thou shalt not have him! Thou shalt not have him!” The maiden thought that the child Mary who stood by her mother Anne had called out that to her, and was angry, and cried, “Fiddle de dee, conceited thing, hold your tongue, and let your mother speak!”"

"“Whither goest thou?” “To Walpe.” “I to Walpe, thou to Walpe, so, so, together we’ll go.”"
"“Hast thou a man? What is his name?” “Cham.” “My man Cham, thy man Cham; I to Walpe, thou to Walpe; so, so, together we’ll go.” “Hast thou a child; how is he styled?” “Wild.” “My child Wild, thy child Wild; my man Cham, thy man Cham; I to Walpe, thou to Walpe, so, so, together we’ll go.” “Hast thou a cradle? How callest thou thy cradle?”"
"“Hippodadle.” “My cradle Hippodadle, my child Wild, thy child Wild, my man Cham, thy man Cham; I to Walpe, thou to Walpe, so, so, together we’ll go.”"
“Hast thou also a drudge? what name has thy drudge?”
"“From-thy-work-do-not-budge.” “My drudge, From-thy-work-do-not-budge:"
"my child Wild, thy child Wild; my man Cham, thy man Cham; I to Walpe, thou to Walpe; so, so, together we’ll go.”"
141 The Lambkin and the Little Fish
"There were once a little brother and a little sister, who loved each other with all their hearts. Their own mother was, however, dead, and they had a step-mother, who was not kind to them, and secretly did everything she could to hurt them. It so happened that the two were playing with other children in a meadow before the house, and there was a pond in the meadow which came up to one side of the house. The children ran about it, and caught each other, and played at counting out."
"“Eneke Beneke, let me live, And I to thee my bird will give."
"The little bird, it straw shall seek, The straw I’ll give to the cow to eat."
"The pretty cow shall give me milk, The milk I’ll to the baker take."
"The baker he shall bake a cake, The cake I’ll give unto the cat."
"The cat shall catch some mice for that, The mice I’ll hang up in the smoke, And then you’ll see the snow.”"
"They stood in a circle while they played this, and the one to whom the word snow fell, had to run away and all the others ran after him and caught him. As they were running about so merrily the step-mother watched them from the window, and grew angry. And as she understood arts of witchcraft she bewitched them both, and changed the little brother into a fish, and the little sister into a lamb. Then the fish swam here and there about the pond and was very sad, and the lambkin walked up and down the meadow, and was miserable, and could not eat or touch one blade of grass. Thus passed a long time, and then strangers came as visitors to the castle. The false step-mother thought, “This is a good opportunity,” and called the cook and said to him, “Go and fetch the lamb from the meadow and kill it, we have nothing else for the visitors.” Then the cook went away and got the lamb, and took it into the kitchen and tied its feet, and all this it bore patiently. When he had drawn out his knife and was whetting it on the door-step to kill the lamb, he noticed a little fish swimming backwards and forwards in the water, in front of the kitchen-sink and looking up at him. This, however, was the brother, for when the fish saw the cook take the lamb away, it followed them and swam along the pond to the house; then the lamb cried down to it,"
"“Ah, brother, in the pond so deep, How sad is my poor heart!"
Even now the cook he whets his knife To take away my tender life.”
"The little fish answered,"
"“Ah, little sister, up on high How sad is my poor heart While in this pond I lie.”"
"When the cook heard that the lambkin could speak and said such sad words to the fish down below, he was terrified and thought this could be no common lamb, but must be bewitched by the wicked woman in the house. Then said he, “Be easy, I will not kill thee,” and took another sheep and made it ready for the guests, and conveyed the lambkin to a good peasant woman, to whom he related all that he had seen and heard."
"The peasant was, however, the very woman who had been foster-mother to the little sister, and she suspected at once who the lamb was, and went with it to a wise woman. Then the wise woman pronounced a blessing over the lambkin and the little fish, by means of which they regained their human forms, and after this she took them both into a little hut in a great forest, where they lived alone, but were contented and happy."
142 Simeli Mountain
"There were once two brothers, the one rich, the other poor. The rich one, however, gave nothing to the poor one, and he gained a scanty living by trading in corn, and often did so badly that he had no bread for his wife and children. Once when he was wheeling a barrow through the forest he saw, on one side of him, a great, bare, naked-looking mountain, and as he had never seen it before, he stood still and stared at it with amazement."
"While he was thus standing he saw twelve great, wild men coming towards him, and as he believed they were robbers he pushed his barrow into the thicket, climbed up a tree, and waited to see what would happen. The twelve men, however, went to the mountain and cried, “Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, open,” and immediately the barren mountain opened down the middle, and the twelve went into it, and as soon as they were within, it shut. After a short time, however, it opened again, and the men came forth carrying heavy sacks on their shoulders, and when they were all once more in the daylight they said, “Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, shut thyself;” then the mountain closed together, and there was no longer any entrance to be seen to it, and the twelve went away."
"When they were quite out of sight the poor man got down from the tree, and was curious to know what really was secretly hidden in the mountain. So he went up to it and said, “Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, open,” and the mountain opened to him also. The he went inside, and the whole mountain was a cavern full of silver and gold, and behind lay great piles of pearls and sparkling jewels, heaped up like corn. The poor man hardly knew what to do, and whether he might take any of these treasures for himself or not; but at last he filled his pockets with gold, but he left the pearls and precious stones where they were. When he came out again he also said, “Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, shut thyself;” and the mountain closed itself, and he went home with his barrow."
"And now he had no more cause for anxiety, but could buy bread for his wife and children with his gold, and wine into the bargain. He lived joyously and uprightly, gave help to the poor, and did good to every one. When, however, the money came to an end he went to his brother, borrowed a measure that held a bushel, and brought himself some more, but did not touch any of the most valuable things. When for the third time he wanted to fetch something, he again borrowed the measure of his brother. The rich man had, however, long been envious of his brother’s possessions, and of the handsome way of living which he had set on foot, and could not understand from whence the riches came, and what his brother wanted with the measure. Then he thought of a cunning trick, and covered the bottom of the measure with pitch, and when he got the measure back a piece of money was sticking in it. He at once went to his brother and asked him, “What hast thou been measuring in the bushel measure?” “Corn and barley,” said the other. Then he showed him the piece of money, and threatened that if he did not tell the truth he would accuse him before a court of justice. The poor man then told him everything, just as it happened. The rich man, however, ordered his carriage to be made ready, and drove away, resolved to use the opportunity better than his brother had done, and to bring back with him quite different treasures."
"When he came to the mountain he cried, “Semsi mountain, Semsi mountain, open.” The mountain opened, and he went inside it. There lay the treasures all before him, and for a long time he did not know which to clutch at first. At length he loaded himself with as many precious stones as he could carry. He wished to carry his burden outside, but, as his heart and soul were entirely full of the treasures, he had forgotten the name of the mountain, and cried, “Simeli mountain, Simeli mountain, open.” That, however, was not the right name, and the mountain never stirred, but remained shut. Then he was alarmed, but the longer he thought about it the more his thoughts confused themselves, and his treasures were no more of any use to him. In the evening the mountain opened, and the twelve robbers came in, and when they saw him they laughed, and cried out, “Bird, have we caught thee at last! Didst thou think we had never noticed that thou hadst been in here twice? We could not catch thee then; this third time thou shalt not get out again!” Then he cried, “It was not I, it was my brother,” but let him beg for his life and say what he would, they cut his head off."
143 Going A-Travelling
"There was once a poor woman who had a son, who much wished to travel, but his mother said, “How canst thou travel? We have no money at all for thee to take away with thee.” Then said the son, “I will manage very well for myself; I will always say, Not much, not much, not much.”"
"So he walked for a long time and always said, “Not much, not much, not much.” Then he passed by a company of fishermen and said, “God speed you! not much, not much, not much.” “What sayst thou churl, ‘not much?’” And when the net was drawn out they had not caught much fish."
"So one of them fell on the youth with a stick and said, “Hast thou never seen me threshing?” “What ought I to say, then?” asked the youth."
"The drummer did not reflect long; he sprang into the midst of the flames, but they did not hurt him, and could not even singe a hair of his head. He carried the log out, and laid it down. Hardly, however, had the wood touched the earth than it was transformed, and the beautiful maiden who had helped him in his need stood before him, and by the silken and shining golden garments which she wore, he knew right well that she was the King’s daughter. But the old woman laughed venomously, and said, “Thou thinkest thou hast her safe, but thou hast not got her yet!” Just as she was about to fall on the maiden and take her away, the youth seized the old woman with both his hands, raised her up on high, and threw her into the jaws of the fire, which closed over her as if it were delighted that an old witch was to be burnt."
"Then the King’s daughter looked at the drummer, and when she saw that he was a handsome youth and remembered how he had risked his life to deliver her, she gave him her hand, and said, “Thou hast ventured everything for my sake, but I also will do everything for thine."
"Promise to be true to me, and thou shalt be my husband. We shall not want for riches, we shall have enough with what the witch has gathered together here.” She led him into the house, where there were chests and coffers crammed with the old woman’s treasures. The maiden left the gold and silver where it was, and took only the precious stones. She would not stay any longer on the glass-mountain, so the drummer said to her, “Seat thyself by me on my saddle, and then we will fly down like birds.” “I do not like the old saddle,” said she, “I need only turn my wishing-ring and we shall be at home.” “Very well, then,” answered the drummer, “then wish us in front of the town-gate.” In the twinkling of an eye they were there, but the drummer said, “I will just go to my parents and tell them the news, wait for me outside here, I shall soon be back.” “Ah,” said the King’s daughter, “I beg thee to be careful. On thy arrival do not kiss thy parents on the right cheek, or else thou wilt forget everything, and I shall stay behind here outside, alone and deserted.” “How can I forget thee?” said he, and promised her to come back very soon, and gave his hand upon it. When he went into his father’s house, he had changed so much that no one knew who he was, for the three days which he had passed on the glass-mountain had been three years. Then he made himself known, and his parents fell on his neck with joy, and his heart was so moved that he forgot what the maiden had said, and kissed them on both cheeks. But when he had given them the kiss on the right cheek, every thought of the King’s daughter vanished from him. He emptied out his pockets, and laid handfuls of the largest jewels on the table. The parents had not the least idea what to do with the riches. Then the father built a magnificent castle all surrounded by gardens, woods, and meadows as if a prince were going to live in it, and when it was ready, the mother said, “I have found a maiden for thee, and the wedding shall be in three days. The son was content to do as his parents desired.”"
"The poor King’s daughter had stood for a long time without the town waiting for the return of the young man. When evening came, she said, “He must certainly have kissed his parents on the right cheek, and has forgotten me.” Her heart was full of sorrow, she wished herself into a solitary little hut in a forest, and would not return to her father’s court. Every evening she went into the town and passed the young man’s house; he often saw her, but he no longer knew her. At length she heard the people saying, “The wedding will take place to-morrow.” Then she said, “I will try if I can win his heart back.”"
"On the first day of the wedding ceremonies, she turned her wishing-ring, and said, “A dress as bright as the sun.” Instantly the dress lay before her, and it was as bright as if it had been woven of real sunbeams. When all the guests were assembled, she entered the hall. Every one was amazed at the beautiful dress, and the bride most of all, and as pretty dresses were the things she had most delight in, she went to the stranger and asked if she would sell it to her. “Not for money,” she answered, “but if I may pass the first night outside the door of the room where your betrothed sleeps, I will give it up to you.” The bride could not overcome her desire and consented, but she mixed a sleeping-draught with the wine her betrothed took at night, which made him fall into a deep sleep, When all had become quiet, the King’s daughter crouched down by the door of the bedroom, opened it just a little, and cried,"
"“Drummer, drummer, I pray thee hear!"
Hast thou forgotten thou heldest me dear?
That on the glass-mountain we sat hour by hour?
That I rescued thy life from the witch’s power?
Didst thou not plight thy troth to me?
"Drummer, drummer, hearken to me!”"
"But it was all in vain, the drummer did not awake, and when morning dawned, the King’s daughter was forced to go back again as she came. On the second evening she turned her wishing-ring and said, “A dress as silvery as the moon.” When she appeared at the feast in the dress which was as soft as moonbeams, it again excited the desire of the bride, and the King’s daughter gave it to her for permission to pass the second night also, outside the door of the bedroom. Then in the stillness of the night, she cried,"
"“Drummer, drummer, I pray thee hear!"
Hast thou forgotten thy heldest me dear?
That on the glass-mountain we sat hour by hour?
That I rescued thy life from the witch’s power?
Didst thou not plight thy troth to me?
"Drummer, drummer, hearken to me!”"
"But the drummer, who was stupefied with the sleeping-draught, could not be aroused. Sadly next morning she went back to her hut in the forest."
"But the people in the house had heard the lamentation of the stranger-maiden, and told the bridegroom about it. They told him also that it was impossible that he could hear anything of it, because the maiden he was going to marry had poured a sleeping-draught into his wine."
"On the third evening, the King’s daughter turned her wishing-ring, and said, “A dress glittering like the stars.” When she showed herself therein at the feast, the bride was quite beside herself with the splendour of the dress, which far surpassed the others, and she said, “I must, and will have it.” The maiden gave it as she had given the others for permission to spend the night outside the bridegroom’s door."
"The bridegroom, however, did not drink the wine which was handed to him before he went to bed, but poured it behind the bed, and when everything was quiet, he heard a sweet voice which called to him,"
"“Drummer, drummer, I pray thee hear!"
Hast thou forgotten thou held me dear?
That on the glass-mountain we sat hour by hour?
That I rescued thy life from the witch’s power?
Didst thou not plight thy troth to me?
"Drummer, drummer, hearken to me!”"
"Suddenly, his memory returned to him. “Ah,” cried he, “how can I have acted so unfaithfully; but the kiss which in the joy of my heart I gave my parents, on the right cheek, that is to blame for it all, that is what stupefied me!” He sprang up, took the King’s daughter by the hand, and led her to his parents’ bed. “This is my true bride,” said he; “if I marry the other, I shall do a great wrong.” The parents, when they heard how everything had happened, gave their consent. Then the lights in the hall were lighted again, drums and trumpets were brought, friends and relations were invited to come, and the real wedding was solemnized with great rejoicing. The first bride received the beautiful dresses as a compensation, and declared herself satisfied."
194 The Ear of Corn
"In former times, when God himself still walked the earth, the fruitfulness of the soil was much greater than it is now; then the ears of corn did not bear fifty or sixty, but four or five hundred-fold."
"Then the corn grew from the bottom to the very top o f the stalk, and according to the length of the stalk was the length of the ear. Men however are so made, that when they are too well off they no longer value the blessings which come from God, but grow indifferent and careless. One day a woman was passing by a corn-field when her little child, who was running beside her, fell into a puddle, and dirtied her frock. On this the mother tore up a handful of the beautiful ears of corn, and cleaned the frock with them."
"Meanwhile the lad looked suspiciously from one side to the other, and shook his head. “Look here,” he said at length, “it may not be all right with your pig. In the village through which I passed, the Mayor himself had just had one stolen out of its sty. I fear—I fear that you have got hold of it there. They have sent out some people and it would be a bad business if they caught you with the pig; at the very least, you would be shut up in the dark hole.”"
"The good Hans was terrified. “Goodness!” he said, “help me out of this fix; you know more about this place than I do, take my pig and leave me your goose.” “I shall risk something at that game,” answered the lad, “but I will not be the cause of your getting into trouble.” So he took the cord in his hand, and drove away the pig quickly along a by-path."
"The good Hans, free from care, went homewards with the goose under his arm. “When I think over it properly,” said he to himself, “I have even gained by the exchange; first there is the good roast-meat, then the quantity of fat which will drip from it, and which will give me dripping for my bread for a quarter of a year, and lastly the beautiful white feathers; I will have my pillow stuffed with them, and then indeed I shall go to sleep without rocking. How glad my mother will be!”"
"As he was going through the last village, there stood a scissors-grinder with his barrow; as his wheel whirred he sang—"
"“I sharpen scissors and quickly grind, My coat blows out in the wind behind.”"
"Hans stood still and looked at him; at last he spoke to him and said, “All’s well with you, as you are so merry with your grinding.” “Yes,”"
"answered the scissors-grinder, “the trade has a golden foundation. A real grinder is a man who as often as he puts his hand into his pocket finds gold in it. But where did you buy that fine goose?”"
"“I did not buy it, but exchanged my pig for it.”"
“And the pig?”
“That I got for a cow.”
“And the cow?”
“I took that instead of a horse.”
“And the horse?”
“For that I gave a lump of gold as big as my head.”
“And the gold?”
"“Well, that was my wages for seven years’ service.”"
"“You have known how to look after yourself each time,” said the grinder. “If you can only get on so far as to hear the money jingle in your pocket whenever you stand up, you will have made your fortune.”"
"“How shall I manage that?” said Hans. “You must be a grinder, as I am; nothing particular is wanted for it but a grindstone, the rest finds itself. I have one here; it is certainly a little worn, but you need not give me anything for it but your goose; will you do it?”"
"“How can you ask?” answered Hans. “I shall be the luckiest fellow on earth; if I have money whenever I put my hand in my pocket, what need I trouble about any longer?” and he handed him the goose and received the grindstone in exchange. “Now,” said the grinder, as he took up an ordinary heavy stone that lay by him, “here is a strong stone for you into the bargain; you can hammer well upon it, and straighten your old nails. Take it with you and keep it carefully.”"
"Hans loaded himself with the stones, and went on with a contented heart; his eyes shone with joy. “I must have been born with a caul,” he cried; “everything I want happens to me just as if I were a Sunday-child.”"
"Meanwhile, as he had been on his legs since daybreak, he began to feel tired. Hunger also tormented him, for in his joy at the bargain by which he got the cow he had eaten up all his store of food at once. At last he could only go on with great trouble, and was forced to stop every minute; the stones, too, weighed him down dreadfully. Then he could not help thinking how nice it would be if he had not to carry them just then."
"He crept like a snail to a well in a field, and there he thought that he would rest and refresh himself with a cool draught of water, but in order that he might not injure the stones in sitting down, he laid them carefully by his side on the edge of the well. Then he sat down on it, and was to stoop and drink, when he made a slip, pushed against the stones, and both of them fell into the water. When Hans saw them with his own eyes sinking to the bottom, he jumped for joy, and then knelt down, and with tears in his eyes thanked God for having shown him this favour also, and delivered him in so good a way, and without his having any need to reproach himself, from those heavy stones which had been the only things that troubled him."
"“There is no man under the sun so fortunate as I,” he cried out. With a light heart and free from every burden he now ran on until he was with his mother at home."
84 Hans Married
"There was once upon a time a young peasant named Hans, whose uncle wanted to find him a rich wife. He therefore seated Hans behind the stove, and had it made very hot. Then he fetched a pot of milk and plenty of white bread, gave him a bright newly-coined farthing in his hand, and said, “Hans, hold that farthing fast, crumble the white bread into the milk, and stay where you are, and do not stir from that spot till I come back.” “Yes,” said Hans, “I will do all that.” Then the wooer put on a pair of old patched trousers, went to a rich peasant’s daughter in the next village, and said, “Won’t you marry my nephew Hans—you will get an honest and sensible man who will suit you?” The covetous father asked, “How is it with regard to his means? Has he bread to break?” “Dear friend,” replied the wooer, “my young nephew has a snug berth, a nice bit of money in hand, and plenty of bread to break, besides he has quite as many patches as I have,” (and as he spoke, he slapped the patches on his trousers, but in that district small pieces of land were called patches also.) “If you will give yourself the trouble to go home with me, you shall see at once that all is as I have said.” Then the miser did not want to lose this good opportunity, and said, “If that is the case, I have nothing further to say against the marriage.”"
"So the wedding was celebrated on the appointed day, and when the young wife went out of doors to see the bridegroom’s property, Hans took off his Sunday coat and put on his patched smock-frock and said, “I might spoil my good coat.” Then together they went out and wherever a boundary line came in sight, or fields and meadows were divided from each other, Hans pointed with his finger and then slapped either a large or a small patch on his smock-frock, and said, “That patch is mine, and that too, my dearest, just look at it,” meaning thereby that his wife should not stare at the broad land, but look at his garment, which was his own."
"“Were you indeed at the wedding?” “Yes, indeed I was there, and in full dress. My head-dress was of snow; then the sun came out, and it was melted. My coat was of cobwebs, and I had to pass by some thorns which tore it off me, my shoes were of glass, and I pushed against a stone and they said, “Klink,” and broke in two."
85 The Gold-Children
"There was once a poor man and a poor woman who had nothing but a little cottage, and who earned their bread by fishing, and always lived from hand to mouth. But it came to pass one day when the man was sitting by the water-side, and casting his net, that he drew out a fish entirely of gold. As he was looking at the fish, full of astonishment, it began to speak and said, “Hark you, fisherman, if you will throw me back again into the water, I will change your little hut into a splendid castle.” Then the fisherman answered, “Of what use is a castle to me, if I have nothing to eat?” The gold fish continued, “That shall be taken care of, there will be a cupboard in the castle in which, when you open it, shall be dishes of the most delicate meats, and as many of them as you can desire.” “If that be true,” said the man, “then I can well do you a favour.” “Yes,” said the fish, “there is, however, the condition that you shall disclose to no one in the world, whosoever he may be, whence your good luck has come, if you speak but one single word, all will be over.” Then the man threw the wonderful fish back again into the water, and went home. But where his hovel had formerly stood, now stood a great castle. He opened wide his eyes, entered, and saw his wife dressed in beautiful clothes, sitting in a splendid room, and she was quite delighted, and said, “Husband, how has all this come to pass? It suits me very well.” “Yes,” said the man, “it suits me too, but I am frightfully hungry, just give me something to eat.” Said the wife, “But I have got nothing and don’t know where to find anything in this new house.” “There is no need of your knowing,” said the man, “for I see yonder a great cupboard, just unlock it.” When she opened it, there stood cakes, meat, fruit, wine, quite a bright prospect."
"Then the woman cried joyfully, “What more can you want, my dear?” and they sat down, and ate and drank together. When they had had enough, the woman said, “But husband, whence come all these riches?” “Alas,”"
"answered he, “do not question me about it, for I dare not tell you anything; if I disclose it to any one, then all our good fortune will fly.” “Very good,” said she, “if I am not to know anything, then I do not want to know anything.” However, she was not in earnest; she never rested day or night, and she goaded her husband until in his impatience he revealed that all was owing to a wonderful golden fish which he had caught, and to which in return he had given its liberty. And as soon as the secret was out, the splendid castle with the cupboard immediately disappeared, they were once more in the old fisherman’s hut, and the man was obliged to follow his former trade and fish. But fortune would so have it, that he once more drew out the golden fish. “Listen,” said the fish, “if you will throw me back into the water again, I will once more give you the castle with the cupboard full of roast and boiled meats; only be firm, for your life’s sake don’t reveal from whom you have it, or you will lose it all again!” “I will take good care,”"
"answered the fisherman, and threw the fish back into the water. Now at home everything was once more in its former magnificence, and the wife was overjoyed at their good fortune, but curiosity left her no peace, so that after a couple of days she began to ask again how it had come to pass, and how he had managed to secure it. The man kept silence for a short time, but at last she made him so angry that he broke out, and betrayed the secret. In an instant the castle disappeared, and they were back again in their old hut. “Now you have got what you want,”"
"This is how it happened that the hedgehog made the hare run races with him on the Buxtehuder heath till he died, and since that time no hare has ever had any fancy for running races with a Buxtehuder hedgehog."
"The moral of this story, however, is, firstly, that no one, however great he may be, should permit himself to jest at any one beneath him, even if he be only a hedgehog. And, secondly, it teaches, that when a man marries, he should take a wife in his own position, who looks just as he himself looks. So whosoever is a hedgehog let him see to it that his wife is a hedgehog also, and so forth."
"188 The Spindle, The Shuttle, and the Needle"
"There was once a girl whose father and mother died while she was still a little child. All alone, in a small house at the end of the village, dwelt her godmother, who supported herself by spinning, weaving, and sewing. The old woman took the forlorn child to live with her, kept her to her work, and educated her in all that is good. When the girl was fifteen years old, the old woman became ill, called the child to her bedside, and said, “Dear daughter, I feel my end drawing near. I leave thee the little house, which will protect thee from wind and weather, and my spindle, shuttle, and needle, with which thou canst earn thy bread.” Then she laid her hands on the girl’s head, blessed her, and said, “Only preserve the love of God in thy heart, and all will go well with thee.” Thereupon she closed her eyes, and when she was laid in the earth, the maiden followed the coffin, weeping bitterly, and paid her the last mark of respect. And now the maiden lived quite alone in the little house, and was industrious, and span, wove, and sewed, and the blessing of the good old woman was on all that she did. It seemed as if the flax in the room increased of its own accord, and whenever she wove a piece of cloth or carpet, or had made a shirt, she at once found a buyer who paid her amply for it, so that she was in want of nothing, and even had something to share with others."
"About this time, the son of the King was travelling about the country looking for a bride. He was not to choose a poor one, and did not want to have a rich one. So he said, “She shall be my wife who is the poorest, and at the same time the richest.” When he came to the village where the maiden dwelt, he inquired, as he did wherever he went, who was the richest and also the poorest girl in the place? They first named the richest; the poorest, they said, was the girl who lived in the small house quite at the end of the village. The rich girl was sitting in all her splendour before the door of her house, and when the prince approached her, she got up, went to meet him, and made him a low curtsey. He looked at her, said nothing, and rode on. When he came to the house of the poor girl, she was not standing at the door, but sitting in her little room. He stopped his horse, and saw through the window, on which the bright sun was shining, the girl sitting at her spinning-wheel, busily spinning. She looked up, and when she saw that the prince was looking in, she blushed all over her face, let her eyes fall, and went on spinning. I do not know whether, just at that moment, the thread was quite even; but she went on spinning until the King’s son had ridden away again. Then she went to the window, opened it, and said, “It is so warm in this room!” but she still looked after him as long as she could distinguish the white feathers in his hat. Then she sat down to work again in her own room and went on with her spinning, and a saying which the old woman had often repeated when she was sitting at her work, came into her mind, and she sang these words to herself,—"
"“Spindle, my spindle, haste, haste thee away, And here to my house bring the wooer, I pray.”"
"And what do you think happened? The spindle sprang out of her hand in an instant, and out of the door, and when, in her astonishment, she got up and looked after it, she saw that it was dancing out merrily into the open country, and drawing a shining golden thread after it. Before long, it had entirely vanished from her sight. As she had now no spindle, the girl took the weaver’s shuttle in her hand, sat down to her loom, and began to weave."
"The spindle, however, danced continually onwards, and just as the thread came to an end, reached the prince. “What do I see?” he cried; “the spindle certainly wants to show me the way!” turned his horse about, and rode back with the golden thread. The girl was, however, sitting at her work singing,"
"“Shuttle, my shuttle, weave well this day, And guide the wooer to me, I pray.”"
Immediately the shuttle sprang out of her hand and out by the door.
"Before the threshold, however, it began to weave a carpet which was more beautiful than the eyes of man had ever yet beheld. Lilies and roses blossomed on both sides of it, and on a golden ground in the centre green branches ascended, under which bounded hares and rabbits, stags and deer stretched their heads in between them, brightly-coloured birds were sitting in the branches above; they lacked nothing but the gift of song. The shuttle leapt hither and thither, and everything seemed to grow of its own accord."
"As the shuttle had run away, the girl sat down to sew. She held the needle in her hand and sang,"
"“Needle, my needle, sharp-pointed and fine, Prepare for a wooer this house of mine.”"
"Then the needle leapt out of her fingers, and flew everywhere about the room as quick as lightning. It was just as if invisible spirits were working; they covered tables and benches with green cloth in an instant, and the chairs with velvet, and hung the windows with silken curtains. Hardly had the needle put in the last stitch than the maiden saw through the window the white feathers of the prince, whom the spindle had brought thither by the golden thread. He alighted, stepped over the carpet into the house, and when he entered the room, there stood the maiden in her poor garments, but she shone out from within them like a rose surrounded by leaves. “Thou art the poorest and also the richest,” said he to her. “Come with me, thou shalt be my bride.”"
"She did not speak, but she gave him her hand. Then he gave her a kiss, led her forth, lifted her on to his horse, and took her to the royal castle, where the wedding was solemnized with great rejoicings. The spindle, shuttle, and needle were preserved in the treasure-chamber, and held in great honour."
189 The Peasant and the Devil
"There was once on a time a far-sighted, crafty peasant whose tricks were much talked about. The best story is, however, how he once got hold of the Devil, and made a fool of him. The peasant had one day been working in his field, and as twilight had set in, was making ready for the journey home, when he saw a heap of burning coals in the middle of his field, and when, full of astonishment, he went up to it, a little black devil was sitting on the live coals. “Thou dost indeed sit upon a treasure!” said the peasant. “Yes, in truth,” replied the Devil, “on a treasure which contains more gold and silver than thou hast ever seen in thy life!” “The treasure lies in my field and belongs to me,” said the peasant. “It is thine,” answered the Devil, “if thou wilt for two years give me the half of everything thy field produces. Money I have enough of, but I have a desire for the fruits of the earth.” The peasant agreed to the bargain. “In order, however, that no dispute may arise about the division,” said he, “everything that is above ground shall belong to thee, and what is under the earth to me.” The Devil was quite satisfied with that, but the cunning peasant had sown turnips."
"Now when the time for harvest came, the Devil appeared and wanted to take away his crop; but he found nothing but the yellow withered leaves, while the peasant, full of delight, was digging up his turnips."
"“Thou hast had the best of it for once,” said the Devil, “but the next time that won’t do. What grows above ground shall be thine, and what is under it, mine.” “I am willing,” replied the peasant; but when the time came to sow, he did not again sow turnips, but wheat. The grain became ripe, and the peasant went into the field and cut the full stalks down to the ground. When the Devil came, he found nothing but the stubble, and went away in a fury down into a cleft in the rocks. “That is the way to cheat the Devil,” said the peasant, and went and fetched away the treasure."
190 The Crumbs on the Table
"A countryman one day said to his little puppies, “Come into the parlour and enjoy yourselves, and pick up the bread-crumbs on the table; your mistress has gone out to pay some visits.” Then the little dogs said, “No, no, we will not go. If the mistress gets to know it, she will beat us.” The countryman said, “She will know nothing about it. Do come; after all, she never gives you anything good.” Then the little dogs again said, “Nay, nay, we must let it alone; we must not go.” But the countryman let them have no peace until at last they went, and got on the table, and ate up the bread-crumbs with all their might. But at that very moment the mistress came, and seized the stick in great haste, and beat them and treated them very hardly. And when they were outside the house, the little dogs said to the countryman, “Dost, dost, dost, dost, dost thou see?” Then the countryman laughed and said, “Didn’t, didn’t, didn’t, you expect it?” So they just had to run away."
191 The Sea-Hare
"There was once upon a time a princess, who, high under the battlements in her castle, had an apartment with twelve windows, which looked out in every possible direction, and when she climbed up to it and looked around her, she could inspect her whole kingdom. When she looked out of the first, her sight was more keen than that of any other human being; from the second she could see still better, from the third more distinctly still, and so it went on, until the twelfth, from which she saw everything above the earth and under the earth, and nothing at all could be kept secret from her. Moreover, as she was haughty, and would be subject to no one, but wished to keep the dominion for herself alone, she caused it to be proclaimed that no one should ever be her husband who could not conceal himself from her so effectually, that it should be quite impossible for her to find him. He who tried this, however, and was discovered by her, was to have his head struck off, and stuck on a post. Ninety-seven posts with the heads of dead men were already standing before the castle, and no one had come forward for a long time. The princess was delighted, and thought to herself, “Now I shall be free as long as I live.” Then three brothers appeared before her, and announced to her that they were desirous of trying their luck."
"The eldest believed he would be quite safe if he crept into a lime-pit, but she saw him from the first window, made him come out, and had his head cut off. The second crept into the cellar of the palace, but she perceived him also from the first window, and his fate was sealed. His head was placed on the nine and ninetieth post. Then the youngest came to her and entreated her to give him a day for consideration, and also to be so gracious as to overlook it if she should happen to discover him twice, but if he failed the third time, he would look on his life as over. As he was so handsome, and begged so earnestly, she said, “Yes, I will grant thee that, but thou wilt not succeed.”"
"Next day he meditated for a long time how he should hide himself, but all in vain. Then he seized his gun and went out hunting. He saw a raven, took a good aim at him, and was just going to fire, when the bird cried, “Don’t shoot; I will make it worth thy while not.” He put his gun down, went on, and came to a lake where he surprised a large fish which had come up from the depths below to the surface of the water. When he had aimed at it, the fish cried, “Don’t shoot, and I will make it worth thy while.” He allowed it to dive down again, went onwards, and met a fox which was lame. He fired and missed it, and the fox cried, “You had much better come here and draw the thorn out of my foot for me.” He did this; but then he wanted to kill the fox and skin it, the fox said, “Stop, and I will make it worth thy while.” The youth let him go, and then as it was evening, returned home."
"Next day he was to hide himself; but howsoever much he puzzled his brains over it, he did not know where. He went into the forest to the raven and said, “I let thee live on, so now tell me where I am to hide myself, so that the King’s daughter shall not see me.” The raven hung his head and thought it over for a longtime. At length he croaked, “I have it.” He fetched an egg out of his nest, cut it into two parts, and shut the youth inside it; then made it whole again, and seated himself on it. When the King’s daughter went to the first window she could not discover him, nor could she from the others, and she began to be uneasy, but from the eleventh she saw him. She ordered the raven to be shot, and the egg to be brought and broken, and the youth was forced to come out. She said, “For once thou art excused, but if thou dost not do better than this, thou art lost!”"
"Next day he went to the lake, called the fish to him and said, “I suffered thee to live, now tell me where to hide myself so that the King’s daughter may not see me.” The fish thought for a while, and at last cried, “I have it! I will shut thee up in my stomach.” He swallowed him, and went down to the bottom of the lake. The King’s daughter looked through her windows, and even from the eleventh did not see him, and was alarmed; but at length from the twelfth she saw him."
"She ordered the fish to be caught and killed, and then the youth appeared. Every one can imagine what a state of mind he was in. She said, “Twice thou art forgiven, but be sure that thy head will be set on the hundredth post.”"
"On the last day, he went with a heavy heart into the country, and met the fox. “Thou knowest how to find all kinds of hiding-places,” said he; “I let thee live, now advise me where I shall hide myself so that the King’s daughter shall not discover me.” “That’s a hard task,”"
"answered the fox, looking very thoughtful. At length he cried, “I have it!” and went with him to a spring, dipped himself in it, and came out as a stall-keeper in the market, and dealer in animals. The youth had to dip himself in the water also, and was changed into a small sea-hare. The merchant went into the town, and showed the pretty little animal, and many persons gathered together to see it. At length the King’s daughter came likewise, and as she liked it very much, she bought it, and gave the merchant a good deal of money for it. Before he gave it over to her, he said to it, “When the King’s daughter goes to the window, creep quickly under the braids of her hair.” And now the time arrived when she was to search for him. She went to one window after another in turn, from the first to the eleventh, and did not see him. When she did not see him from the twelfth either, she was full of anxiety and anger, and shut it down with such violence that the glass in every window shivered into a thousand pieces, and the whole castle shook."
She went back and felt the sea-hare beneath the braids of her hair.
"Then she seized it, and threw it on the ground exclaiming, “Away with thee, get out of my sight!” It ran to the merchant, and both of them hurried to the spring, wherein they plunged, and received back their true forms. The youth thanked the fox, and said, “The raven and the fish are idiots compared with thee; thou knowest the right tune to play, there is no denying that!”"
"“Thou must say, ‘Get it full, get it full.’” After this he again walked a long time, and said, “Get it full, get it full,” until he came to the gallows, where they had got a poor sinner whom they were about to hang."
"Then said he, “Good morning; get it full, get it full.” “What sayst thou, knave, get it full? Dost thou want to make out that there are still more wicked people in the world is not this enough?” And he again got some blows on his back. “What am I to say, then?” said he. “Thou must say, may God have pity on the poor soul.”"
"Again the youth walked on for a long while and said, “May God have pity on the poor soul!” Then he came to a pit by which stood a knacker who was cutting up a horse. The youth said, “Good morning; God have pity on the poor soul!” “What dost thou say, thou ill-tempered knave?” and the knacker gave him such a box on the ear, that he could not see out of his eyes. “What am I to say, then?” “Thou must say, ‘There lies the carrion in the pit!’”"
"So he walked on, and always said, “There lies the carrion in the pit, there lies the carrion in the pit.” And he came to a cart full of people, so he said, “Good morning, there lies the carrion in the pit!”"
"Then the cart pushed him into a hole, and the driver took his whip and cracked it upon the youth, till he was forced to crawl back to his mother, and as long as he lived he never went out a-travelling again."
144 The Donkey
"Once on a time there lived a King and a Queen, who were rich, and had everything they wanted, but no children. The Queen lamented over this day and night, and said, “I am like a field on which nothing grows.” At last God gave her her wish, but when the child came into the world, it did not look like a human child, but was a little donkey. When the mother saw that, her lamentations and outcries began in real earnest; she said she would far rather have had no child at all than have a donkey, and that they were to throw it into the water that the fishes might devour it. But the King said, “No, since God has sent him he shall be my son and heir, and after my death sit on the royal throne, and wear the kingly crown.” The donkey, therefore, was brought up and grew bigger, and his ears grew up beautifully high and straight. He was, however, of a merry disposition, jumped about, played and had especial pleasure in music, so that he went to a celebrated musician and said, “Teach me thine art, that I may play the lute as well as thou dost.” “Ah, dear little master,” answered the musician, “that would come very hard to you, your fingers are certainly not suited to it, and are far too big. I am afraid the strings would not last.” No excuses were of any use. The donkey was determined to play the lute; he was persevering and industrious, and at last learnt to do it as well as the master himself. The young lordling once went out walking full of thought and came to a well, he looked into it and in the mirror-clear water saw his donkey’s form. He was so distressed about it, that he went out into the wide world and only took with him one faithful companion. They travelled up and down, and at last they came into a kingdom where an old King reigned who had an only but wonderfully beautiful daughter. The donkey said, “Here we will stay,” knocked at the gate, and cried, “A guest is without open, that he may enter.” As, however, the gate was not opened, he sat down, took his lute and played it in the most delightful manner with his two fore-feet. Then the door-keeper opened his eyes most wonderfully wide, and ran to the King and said, “Outside by the gate sits a young donkey which plays the lute as well as an experienced master!” “Then let the musician come to me,”"
"said the King. When, however, a donkey came in, every one began to laugh at the lute-player. And now the donkey was asked to sit down and eat with the servants. He, however, was unwilling, and said, “I am no common stable-ass, I am a noble one.” Then they said, “If that is what thou art, seat thyself with the men of war.” “No,” said he, “I will sit by the King.” The King smiled, and said good-humouredly, “Yes, it shall be as thou wilt, little ass, come here to me.” Then he asked, “Little ass, how does my daughter please thee?” The donkey turned his head towards her, looked at her, nodded and said, “I like her above measure, I have never yet seen anyone so beautiful as she is.” “Well, then, thou shalt sit next her too,” said the King. “That is exactly what I wish,”"
"said the donkey, and he placed himself by her side, ate and drank, and knew how to behave himself daintily and cleanly. When the noble beast had stayed a long time at the King’s court, he thought, “What good does all this do me, I shall still have to go home again?” let his head hang sadly, and went to the King and asked for his dismissal. But the King had grown fond of him, and said, “Little ass, what ails thee? Thou lookest as sour as a jug of vinegar, I will give thee what thou wantest. Dost thou want gold?” “No,” said the donkey, and shook his head. “Dost thou want jewels and rich dress?” “No.” “Dost thou wish for half my kingdom?” “Indeed, no.” Then said the King, “if I did but know what would make thee content. Wilt thou have my pretty daughter to wife?” “Ah, yes,” said the ass, “I should indeed like her,” and all at once he became quite merry and full of happiness, for that was exactly what he was wishing for. So a great and splendid wedding was held. In the evening, when the bride and bridegroom were led into their bed-room, the King wanted to know if the ass would behave well, and ordered a servant to hide himself there. When they were both within, the bridegroom bolted the door, looked around, and as he believed that they were quite alone, he suddenly threw off his ass’s skin, and stood there in the form of a handsome royal youth. “Now,” said he, “thou seest who I am, and seest also that I am not unworthy of thee.” Then the bride was glad, and kissed him, and loved him dearly. When morning came, he jumped up, put his animal’s skin on again, and no one could have guessed what kind of a form was hidden beneath it. Soon came the old King, “Ah,” cried he, “is the little ass merry? But surely thou art sad?” said he to his daughter, “that thou hast not got a proper man for thy husband?” “Oh, no, dear father, I love him as well as if he were the handsomest in the world, and I will keep him as long as I live.”"
"The King was surprised, but the servant who had concealed himself came and revealed everything to him. The King said, “That cannot be true.”"
"“Then watch yourself the next night, and you will see it with your own eyes; and hark you, lord King, if you were to take his skin away and throw it in the fire, he would be forced to show himself in his true shape.” “Thy advice is good,” said the King, and at night when they were asleep, he stole in, and when he got to the bed he saw by the light of the moon a noble-looking youth lying there, and the skin lay stretched on the ground. So he took it away, and had a great fire lighted outside, and threw the skin into it, and remained by it himself until it was all burnt to ashes. As, however, he was anxious to know how the robbed man would behave himself, he stayed awake the whole night and watched. When the youth had slept his sleep out, he got up by the first light of morning, and wanted to put on the ass’s skin, but it was not to be found. On this he was alarmed, and, full of grief and anxiety, said, “Now I shall have to contrive to escape.” But when he went out, there stood the King, who said, “My son, whither away in such haste? what hast thou in mind? Stay here, thou art such a handsome man, thou shalt not go away from me. I will now give thee half my kingdom, and after my death thou shalt have the whole of it.” “Then I hope that what begins so well may end well, and I will stay with you,” said the youth. And the old man gave him half the kingdom, and in a year’s time, when he died, the youth had the whole, and after the death of his father he had another kingdom as well, and lived in all magnificence."
145 The Ungrateful Son
"A man and his wife were once sitting by the door of their house, and they had a roasted chicken set before them, and were about to eat it together. Then the man saw that his aged father was coming, and hastily took the chicken and hid it, for he would not permit him to have any of it. The old man came, took a drink, and went away. Now the son wanted to put the roasted chicken on the table again, but when he took it up, it had become a great toad, which jumped into his face and sat there and never went away again, and if any one wanted to take it off, it looked venomously at him as if it would jump in his face, so that no one would venture to touch it. And the ungrateful son was forced to feed the toad every day, or else it fed itself on his face; and thus he went about the world without knowing rest."
146 The Turnip
"There were once two brothers who both served as soldiers; one of them was rich, and the other poor. Then the poor one, to escape from his poverty, put off his soldier’s coat, and turned farmer. He dug and hoed his bit of land, and sowed it with turnip-seed. The seed came up, and one turnip grew there which became large and vigorous, and visibly grew bigger and bigger, and seemed as if it would never stop growing, so that it might have been called the princess of turnips, for never was such an one seen before, and never will such an one be seen again."
"At length it was so enormous that by itself it filled a whole cart, and two oxen were required to draw it, and the farmer had not the least idea what he was to do with the turnip, or whether it would be a fortune to him or a misfortune. At last he thought, “If thou sellest it, what wilt thou get for it that is of any importance, and if thou eatest it thyself, why, the small turnips would do thee just as much good; it would be better to take it to the King, and make him a present of it.”"
"So he placed it on a cart, harnessed two oxen, took it to the palace, and presented it to the King. “What strange thing is this?” said the King. “Many wonderful things have come before my eyes, but never such a monster as this! From what seed can this have sprung, or are you a luck-child and have met with it by chance?” “Ah, no!” said the farmer, “no luck-child am I. I am a poor soldier, who because he could no longer support himself hung his soldier’s coat on a nail and took to farming land. I have a brother who is rich and well known to you, Lord King, but I, because I have nothing, am forgotten by every one.”"
"Then the King felt compassion for him, and said, “Thou shalt be raised from thy poverty, and shalt have such gifts from me that thou shalt be equal to thy rich brother.” Then he bestowed on him much gold, and lands, and meadows, and herds, and made him immensely rich, so that the wealth of the other brother could not be compared with his. When the rich brother heard what the poor one had gained for himself with one single turnip, he envied him, and thought in every way how he also could get hold of a similar piece of luck. He would, however, set about it in a much wiser way, and took gold and horses and carried them to the King, and made certain the King would give him a much larger present in return. If his brother had got so much for one turnip, what would he not carry away with him in return for such beautiful things as these? The King accepted his present, and said he had nothing to give him in return that was more rare and excellent than the great turnip."
"So the rich man was obliged to put his brother’s turnip in a cart and have it taken to his home. When there he did not know on whom to vent his rage and anger, until bad thoughts came to him, and he resolved to kill his brother. He hired murderers, who were to lie in ambush, and then he went to his brother and said, “Dear brother, I know of a hidden treasure, we will dig it up together, and divide it between us.” The other agreed to this, and accompanied him without suspicion. While they were on their way, however, the murderers fell on him, bound him, and would have hanged him to a tree. But just as they were doing this, loud singing and the sound of a horse’s feet were heard in the distance. On this their hearts were filled with terror, and they pushed their prisoner head first into the sack, hung it on a branch, and took to flight. He, however, worked up there until he had made a hole in the sack through which he could put his head. The man who was coming by was no other than a travelling student, a young fellow who rode on his way through the wood joyously singing his song. When he who was aloft saw that someone was passing below him, he cried, “Good day! You have come at a lucky time.” The student looked round on every side, but did not know whence the voice came. At last he said, “Who calls me?” Then an answer came from the top of the tree, “Raise your eyes; here I sit aloft in the Sack of Wisdom. In a short time have I learnt great things; compared with this all schools are a jest; in a very short time I shall have learnt everything, and shall descend wiser than all other men. I understand the stars, and the signs of the Zodiac, and the tracks of the winds, the sand of the sea, the healing of illness, and the virtues of all herbs, birds, and stones. If you were once within it you would feel what noble things issue forth from the Sack of Knowledge.”"
"The student, when he heard all this, was astonished, and said, “Blessed be the hour in which I have found thee! May not I also enter the sack for a while?” He who was above replied as if unwillingly, “For a short time I will let you get into it, if you reward me and give me good words; but you must wait an hour longer, for one thing remains which I must learn before I do it.” When the student had waited a while he became impatient, and begged to be allowed to get in at once, his thirst for knowledge was so very great. So he who was above pretended at last to yield, and said, “In order that I may come forth from the house of knowledge you must let it down by the rope, and then you shall enter it.” So the student let the sack down, untied it, and set him free, and then cried, “Now draw me up at once,” and was about to get into the sack. “Halt!” said the other, “that won’t do,” and took him by the head and put him upside down into the sack, fastened it, and drew the disciple of wisdom up the tree by the rope. Then he swung him in the air and said, “How goes it with thee, my dear fellow? Behold, already thou feelest wisdom coming, and art gaining valuable experience. Keep perfectly quiet until thou becomest wiser.” Thereupon he mounted the student’s horse and rode away, but in an hour’s time sent some one to let the student out again."
147 The Old Man Made Young Again
"In the time when our Lord still walked this earth, he and St. Peter stopped one evening at a smith’s and received free quarters. Then it came to pass that a poor beggar, hardly pressed by age and infirmity, came to this house and begged alms of the smith. St. Peter had compassion on him and said, “Lord and master, if it please thee, cure his torments that he may be able to win his own bread.” The Lord said kindly, “Smith, lend me thy forge, and put on some coals for me, and then I will make this ailing old man young again.” The smith was quite willing, and St. Peter blew the bellows, and when the coal fire sparkled up large and high our Lord took the little old man, pushed him in the forge in the midst of the red-hot fire, so that he glowed like a rose-bush, and praised God with a loud voice. After that the Lord went to the quenching tub, put the glowing little man into it so that the water closed over him, and after he had carefully cooled him, gave him his blessing, when behold the little man sprang nimbly out, looking fresh, straight, healthy, and as if he were but twenty. The smith, who had watched everything closely and attentively, invited them all to supper. He, however, had an old half-blind crooked, mother-in-law who went to the youth, and with great earnestness asked if the fire had burnt him much. He answered that he had never felt more comfortable, and that he had sat in the red heat as if he had been in cool dew. The youth’s words echoed in the ears of the old woman all night long, and early next morning, when the Lord had gone on his way again and had heartily thanked the smith, the latter thought he might make his old mother-in-law young again likewise, as he had watched everything so carefully, and it lay in the province of his trade. So he called to ask her if she, too, would like to go bounding about like a girl of eighteen. She said, “With all my heart, as the youth has come out of it so well.” So the smith made a great fire, and thrust the old woman into it, and she writhed about this way and that, and uttered terrible cries of murder. “Sit still; why art thou screaming and jumping about so?”"
"cried he, and as he spoke he blew the bellows again until all her rags were burnt. The old woman cried without ceasing, and the smith thought to himself, “I have not quite the right art,” and took her out and threw her into the cooling-tub. Then she screamed so loudly that the smith’s wife upstairs and her daughter-in-law heard, and they both ran downstairs, and saw the old woman lying in a heap in the quenching-tub, howling and screaming, with her face wrinkled and shrivelled and all out of shape. Thereupon the two, who were both with child, were so terrified that that very night two boys were born who were not made like men but apes, and they ran into the woods, and from them sprang the race of apes."
148 The Lord’s Animals and the Devil’s
"The Lord God had created all animals, and had chosen out the wolf to be his dog, but he had forgotten the goat. Then the Devil made ready and began to create also, and created goats with fine long tails. Now when they went to pasture, they generally remained caught in the hedges by their tails, then the Devil had to go there and disentangle them, with a great deal of trouble. This enraged him at last, and he went and bit off the tail of every goat, as may be seen to this day by the stump."
"Then he let them go to pasture alone, but it came to pass that the Lord God perceived how at one time they gnawed away at a fruitful tree, at another injured the noble vines, or destroyed other tender plants. This distressed him, so that in his goodness and mercy he summoned his wolves, who soon tore in pieces the goats that went there. When the devil observed this, he went before the Lord and said, “Thy creatures have destroyed mine.” The Lord answered, “Why didst thou create things to do harm?” The Devil said, “I was compelled to do it: inasmuch as my thoughts run on evil, what I create can have no other nature, and thou must pay me heavy damages.” “I will pay thee as soon as the oak leaves fall; come then, thy money will then be ready counted out.” When the oak-leaves had fallen, the Devil came and demanded what was due to him."
"But the Lord said, “In the church of Constantinople stands a tall oak-tree which still has all its leaves.” With raging and curses, the Devil departed, and went to seek the oak, wandered in the wilderness for six months before he found it, and when he returned, all the oaks had in the meantime covered themselves again with green leaves. Then he had to forfeit his indemnity, and in his rage he put out the eyes of all the remaining goats, and put his own in instead."
"This is why all goats have devil’s eyes, and their tails bitten off, and why he likes to assume their shape."
149 The Beam
"There was once an enchanter who was standing in the midst of a great crowd of people performing his wonders. He had a cock brought in, which lifted a heavy beam and carried it as if it were as light as a feather."
"But a girl was present who had just found a bit of four-leaved clover, and had thus become so wise that no deception could stand out against her, and she saw that the beam was nothing but a straw. So she cried, “You people, do you not see that it is a straw that the cock is carrying, and no beam?” Immediately the enchantment vanished, and the people saw what it was, and drove the magician away in shame and disgrace. He, however, full of inward anger, said, “I will soon revenge myself.”"
"After some time the girl’s wedding-day came, and she was decked out, and went in a great procession over the fields to the place where the church was. All at once she came to a stream which was very much swollen, and there was no bridge and no plank to cross it. Then the bride nimbly took her clothes up, and wanted to wade through it. And just as she was thus standing in the water, a man, and it was the enchanter, cried mockingly close beside her, “Aha! Where are thine eyes that thou takest that for water?” Then her eyes were opened, and she saw that she was standing with her clothes lifted up in the middle of a field that was blue with the flowers of blue flax. Then all the people saw it likewise, and chased her away with ridicule and laughter."

ENCOUNTER
By J. Hunter Holly Author of THE GREEN PLANET
"It came plummeting out of the sky--a soundless, streaking, purple glow,"
"moving faster and faster until it ripped at the trees, crashed through"
them and struck sickeningly against a hill. Momentarily it flared
"brightly, then went out."
"It was not long after that the murders began--strange, inexplicable"
"deaths, all the victims found with their heads crushed as if their"
skulls had exploded outward.
"The trail of victims lead from Arkansas to Tennessee, to Kentucky,"
Illinois and Michigan--sixteen unrelated people who had only one thing
"in common: All of their brains were withered, as if sucked dry of their"

"And somewhere wandered an evil stranger from another planet, his"

"MORGAN, COLONEL BLODRE, or BLEDRY."
This buccaneer was probably a relation of Sir Henry Morgan. He was an
important person in Jamaica between 1660 and 1670. At the taking of Panama
by Henry Morgan in 1670 the Colonel commanded the rearguard of 300 men. In
"May, 1671, he was appointed to act as Deputy Governor of Providence Island"
by Sir James Modyford.
"MORGAN, LIEUT.-COLONEL EDWARD. Buccaneer."
Uncle and father-in-law of Sir Henry Morgan.
"In 1665, when war had been declared on Holland, the Governor of Jamaica"
issued commissions to several pirates and buccaneers to sail to and attack
"the Dutch islands of St. Eustatius, Saba, and Curacao. Morgan was put in"
"command of ten ships and some 500 men; most of them were ""reformed"
"prisoners,"" while some were condemned pirates who had been pardoned in"
order to let them join the expedition.
"Before leaving Jamaica the crews mutinied, but were pacified by the"
promise of an equal share of all the spoils that should be taken. Three
"ships out of the fleet slipped away on the voyage, but the rest arrived at"
"St. Kitts, landed, and took the fort. Colonel Morgan, who was an old and"
"corpulent man, died of the heat and exertion during the campaign."

In 1511 he sailed from Algiers with a fleet of twenty-two vessels and
"1,700 men to raid Majorca. The Moors landed at Soller and pillaged it."
"Before they could get back to their ship, the pirates were attacked by the"
"Majorcans, headed by Miguel Angelats, and completely routed, 500 of them"
being killed.

ABERDEEN: THE UNIVERSITY PRESS
[Transcriber's Notes:
This book contains a number of misprints.
The following misprints have been corrected:
The great eurypterids--some of which were five or six feet in
length--and the cephalopods were still masters of the seas. Fishes
were as yet few and small; trilobites and graptolites had now
passed their prime and had diminished greatly in numbers.
Scorpions are found in this period both in Europe and in America.
"The limestone-making seas of the Silurian swarmed with corals,"
"crinoids, and brachiopods."
With the end of the Silurian period the AGE OF INVERTEBRATES comes
"to a close, giving place to the Devonian, the AGE OF FISHES."
CHAPTER XVIII
THE DEVONIAN
In America the Silurian is not separated from the Devonian by any
mountain-making deformation or continental uplift. The one period
passed quietly into the other. Their conformable systems are so
"closely related, and the change in their faunas is so gradual,"
that geologists are not agreed as to the precise horizon which
divides them.
SUBDIVISIONS AND PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. The Devonian is represented
in New York and southward by the following five series. We add the
rocks of which they are chiefly composed.
"TURNLEY, CAPTAIN RICHARD."
A New Providence pirate who received the general pardon from Captain
"Woodes Rogers in 1718. When, a little later, the scandal of Captain"
Rackam's infatuation for Anne Bonny was causing such gossip among the two
"thousand ex-pirates who formed the population of the settlement, it was"
Turnley who brought news of the affair to the notice of the Governor. In
"revenge for this action, Rackam and his lady, one day hearing that Turnley"
"had sailed to a neighbouring island to catch turtles, followed him. It"
"happened that Turnley was on shore hunting wild pigs and so escaped, but"
Rackam sank his sloop and took his crew away with him as prisoners.
"TYLE, CAPTAIN ORT VAN."
A Dutchman from New York.
A successful pirate in the days of the Madagascan sea-rovers. For some
"time he sailed in company with Captain James, taking several prizes in the"
Indian Ocean.
Van Tyle had a plantation at Madagascar and used to put his prisoners to
"work there as slaves, one in particular being the notorious Welsh pirate,"
"David Williams, who toiled with Van Tyles's other slaves for six months"
before making his escape to a friendly tribe in the neighbourhood.
"UPTON, BOATSWAIN JOHN."
Born in 1679 of honest parents at Deptford.
"Apprenticed to a waterman, he afterwards went to sea, serving on different"
"“No, French.”"
"“Ah, then, you needn’t be surprised. A Frenchman has no obligation to"
understand anything that’s not French.”
“Nevertheless he was an intelligent man.”
“Did he perhaps have a good deal of veneration?”
"“No, he boasted of not having any.”"
“Doubtless he did have without suspecting it. With a man who had no
"veneration, what difference would it make whether there was one bad"
thing among a lot of good ones?”
"The German with the green hat, who understood something of the"
"conversation, was indignant at Cæsar’s irreverent ideas. He asked him"
"if he understood Latin, and Cæsar told him no, and then, in a strange"
"gibberish, half Latin and half Italian, he let loose a series of facts,"
"dates, and numbers. Then he asserted that all artistic things of great"
"merit were German: Greece. Rome, Gothic architecture, the Italian"
"Renaissance, Leonardo da Vinci, Velázquez, all German."
"The snub-nosed young person, with his cape and his green hat with its"
"cock-feather, did not let a mouse escape from his German mouse-trap."
"The data of the befeathered German were too much for Cæsar, and he took"
his leave of the painters.
"and named Cortés; the other, large, ordinary, fleshy, and coarse, seemed"
rather a bully.
"Giovanni Battista was not able to be long outside the workshop, no doubt"
"because his conscience troubled him, and though with difficulty, he got"
"up and left. Kennedy, Cæsar, and the two Spaniards went toward the"
"Piazza, del Campidoglio, and Buonacossi marched off in the opposite"
direction.
"On reaching the Via Nazionale, Kennedy took his leave and Cæsar"
"remained with the two Spaniards. The red, fleshy one, who had the air of"
"a bully, started in to make fun of the Italians, and to mimic their bows"
and salutes; then he said that he had an engagement with a woman and
made haste to take his leave.
"When he had gone, the grave Spaniard with the sour face, said to Cæsar:"
“That chap is like the dandies here; that’s why he imitates them so
well.”
Afterwards Cortés talked about his studies in painting; he didn’t get
"on well, he had no money, and anyway Rome didn’t please him at all."
"Everything seemed wrong to him, absurd, ridiculous."
"Cæsar, after he had said good-bye to him, murmured: “The truth is that"
we Spaniards are impossible people.”

as to the effect of Lutheran Protestantism in destroying Danish
"liberties (pp. 10, 11). But it is hard to see that there were any"
"popular liberties to destroy, save in so far as the party which set up"
the Reformation undid the popular laws of Christian II. The greatest
social reforms in Denmark are certainly the work of the last
half-century.]

"“No, indeed,” the Englishman proclaimed."
Cæsar and Kennedy disagreed about everything.
"Susanna discussed her plans, and constantly referred to Paul Bourget’s"
"novel _Cosmopolis_, which had obviously influenced her in her"
inclination for Catholicism.
“Are there many Jewish ladies who aspire to be baptized and become
"Catholics, as Bourget says?” asked Susanna."
“Bah!” exclaimed Cæsar.
“You do not believe that either?”
"“No, it strikes me as a piece of naïvety in this good soul of a"
"novelist. To become a Catholic, I don’t believe requires more than some"
few pesetas.”
"“You are detestable, as a Cardinal’s nephew.”"
“I mean that I don’t perceive that there are any obstacles to prevent
"anybody from becoming a Catholic, as there are to prevent his becoming"
"rich. What a high ambition, to aspire to be a Catholic! While nobody"
anywhere does anything but laugh at Catholics; and it has become an
axiom: ‘A Catholic country is a country bound for certain ruin.’”
Kennedy burst out laughing.
"Susanna said that she had no real faith, but that she did have a great"
"enthusiasm for churches and for choirs, for the smell of incense and"
"Encouraged by these assurances, one of the newcomers said to the other:"
"""Come on, let's sit down here and have a coffee--we needn't stop long."""
"All the smaller tables were occupied, but there was one long table that"
stretched across the room and only a few men were sitting at the far end
of it. The officers sat down at the near end and ordered coffee. They
"seemed a little embarrassed at first, but they soon began to talk freely"
to each other:
"""I wonder if there's a war on in these parts--I hear the Huns have made"
"a bit of a push."""
"""Curse the blighters--they'll mess up my leave, it's due in a week's"
"time."""
"""Jolly good coffee, this! Here, Marie, bring us another two cups--der"
"coop der caffay--that's right, isn't it?"""
"""Dat's right,"" said the girl, ""you speak goot French--vous avez tout a"
"fait l'accent parisien."""
"Suddenly her sister came running into the room, sobbing loudly:"
"""English soldier come round from Commandant--he tell us Shermans"
"come--ve got to go 'vay at once, ve got to leave everysing--ve go 'vay"
and English troops steal everysing and shellss come and smash everysing
"and ve looss everysing."""
The civilians of the village had received orders to leave immediately.
Through the window we could see groups of people standing in the street
"On the beach all the villagers are astir. The women, who have put on"
"their new grass petticoats (sevata'i) specially made for this occasion,"
enter the water and approach the canoes to unload them. No special
greetings pass between them and their husbands. They are interested
"in the food brought from Dobu, more especially in the sago."
People from other villages assemble also in great numbers to greet the
incoming party. Those who have supplied their friends or relatives
"with provisions for their journey, receive now sago, betel-nuts and"
coco-nuts in repayment. Some of the welcoming crowd have come in order
to make Kula. Even from the distant districts of Luba and Kiriwina
"natives will travel to Sinaketa, having a fair idea of the date of"
the arrival of the Kula party from Dobu. The expedition will be talked
"over, the yield counted, the recent history of the important valuables"
described. But this stage leads us already into the subject of inland
"Kula, which will form the subject of one of the following chapters."
CHAPTER XVI
THE RETURN VISIT OF THE DOBUANS TO SINAKETA
I
_LEGEND AND HISTORY_
"Cæsar went out of the cabinet, leaving the German and Cortés seated on"
"the sofa, absorbed in the picture; he looked at various paintings in the"
"gallery, went back, and sat down, beside the artists."
"“This portrait,” he said presently, “is like history by the side of"
"legend. All the other paintings in the gallery are legend, ‘folk-lore,’"
as I believe one calls it. This one is history.”
"“That’s what it is. It is truth,” agreed Cortés."
"“Yes, but there are people who do not like the truth, my friend. I tell"
"you: this is a man of flesh, somewhat enigmatic, like nature herself,"
and with arteries in which blood flows; this is a man who breathes and
"digests, and not merely a pleasant abstraction; you, who understand such"
"things, will tell me that the drawing is perfect, and the colour such"
as it was in reality; but how about the person who doesn’t ask for
reality?”
"“Stendhal, the writer, was affected that way by this picture,” said"
Cortés; “he was shocked at its being hung among masterpieces.”
"“He found it bad, no doubt.”"
“Very bad?”
“Was this Stendhal English?”
"they are oxygen-breathing."""
"""We can assume from the stellar type of their primaries that they are."""
"Linus nodded. ""Probably, but not positively."""
"Regin Naylo said, ""And what's second, Linus?"""
"""They may be contraterrene."""
"""Seetee?"""
"Linus Brein nodded. ""In which case from both sides we must watch our"
steps. Get involved with a seetee race the wrong way and you have two
"cultures with absolutely nothing in common but a life-factor, busy"
tossing chunks of their own kind of matter at one another in a fight
"to exterminate. So before either of you start making half-baked plans,"
you'd better get your heads together and plan something that sounds
"reasonable to the Big Boss. Right?"""

Commodore Wilson eyed the spacecraft full of hastily assembled
instruments with a grimace. The ship was swarming with techs who were
"peering into oscilloscopes, watching meters, and tinkering with signal"
generators. A huge concave hemispherical dome above was a splatter of
little flickering green pinpoints and dark patches.
"Defoe is uncertain, though the character of Robinson Crusoe was certainly"
"founded on his adventures in Juan Fernandez. In 1712 he returned to Largo,"
"living the life of a recluse, and we must be forgiven for suspecting that"
"he rather acted up to the part, since it is recorded that he made a cave"
in his father's garden in which to meditate. This life of meditation in an
artificial cave was soon rudely interrupted by the appearance of a certain
"Miss Sophia Bonce, with whom Selkirk fell violently in love, and they"
"eloped together to Bristol, which must have proved indeed a sad scandal to"
the elders and other godly citizens of Largo. Beyond the fact that he was
"charged at Bristol with assaulting one Richard Nettle, a shipwright, we"
"hear no more of Selkirk until his first will was drawn up in 1717, in"
"which he leaves his fortune and house to ""my loving friend Sophia Bonce,"
"of the Pall Mall, London, Spinster."" Shortly after this, Alexander basely"
"deserted his loving friend and married a widow, one Mrs. Francis Candis,"
at Oarston in Devon.
"In 1720 he was appointed mate to H.M.S. _Weymouth_, on board of which he"
died a year later at the age of 45.
"Selkirk is immortalized in literature, not only by Defoe, but by Cowper in"
"his ""Lines on Solitude,"" beginning: ""I am monarch of all I survey."""

"followed them into his sanctum, ""Mullins!"" he snapped, ""don't stand"
"there staring. Get on with your work, at once."
"""You're later than I expected,"" he remarked to Slyne as he closed the"
"door, ""but just in time. The Court's closed, of course, for the"
"Christmas vacation, but I've filed an application for a hearing in"
"Chambers, and--"""
"He paused as a telephone-bell rang shrilly outside, and a moment later"
"the shock head of his ""managing clerk"" protruded into the room, almost"
as if it did not belong to a body at all.

"Mr. Justice Gaunt, in 57B, at eleven-thirty sharp this forenoon,"""

"incensed. ""I wouldn't keep a crested cobra like that about me for--"""
"""Let's see those accounts of yours, now,"" said Slyne, disregarding that"
"interruption, and Mr. Jobling, having first looked at his watch,"
"produced from another drawer a great sheaf of papers, all carefully"
docketed. He slipped off the top one and somewhat reluctantly handed
that to his friend.

eyes which presently began to glow.

takes the place of the Virgin Mary.

STORM MAGIC
The cabin-boy had been traveling around all summer long with his
"captain; but when they began to prepare to set sail in the fall, he grew"
"restless and did not want to go along. The captain liked him, for though"
"he was no more than a boy, he was quite at home on deck, was a big, tall"
"lad, and did not mind lending a hand when need arose; then, too, he did"
"as much work as an able seaman, and was so full of fun that he kept the"
whole crew in good humor. And so the captain did not like to lose him.
But the youth said out and out that he was not minded to take to the
blue pond in the fall; though he was willing to stay on board till
"the ship was loaded and ready to sail. One Sunday, while the crew was"
"ashore, and the captain had gone to a farm-holding near the forest, in"
order to bargain for small timber and log wood--presumably on his own
"account--for a deck load, the youth had been left to guard the ship."
"But you must know that he was a Sunday child, and had found a four-leaf"
Kennedy related the history of the Farnese Palace to Cæsar. They went
through the Via del Mascherone and came out into the Via Giulia.
"“This Via Giulia is a street in a provincial capital,” said Kennedy;"
“always sad and deserted; a Cardinal or two who like isolation are still
living here.”
"At the entrance to the Via dei Farnesi, Cæsar stopped to look at two"
marble tablets set into the wall at the two sides of a chapel door.
"Cut on the tablets were skeletons painted black; on one, the words:"
"“Alms for the poor dead bodies found in the fields,” and on the other:"
“Alms for the perpetual lamp in the cemetery.”
“What does this mean?” said Cæsar.
“That is the Church of the Orison of the Confraternity of Death. The
tablets are modern.”
"They passed by the “Mascherone” again, and went rambling on until they"
reached the Synagogue and the Theatre of Marcellus.
They went through narrow streets without sidewalks; they passed across
"tiny squares; and it seemed like a dead city, or like the outskirts of a"
village. In certain streets towered high dark palaces of blackish stone.
These mysterious palaces looked uninhabited; the gratings were eaten
"with rust, all sorts of weeds grew on the roofs, and the balconies were"
"covered with climbing plants. At corners, set into the wall, one saw"
"niches with glass fronts. A painted madonna, black now, with silver"
"jewels and a crown, could be guessed at inside, and in front a little"
lantern swung on a cord.
in lockers for a while without speaking. Then he spoke slowly and
deliberately.
"""It strikes me that when I was an officer of the bodyguard, in the"
"service of the late Fernando the Seventh, my right royal namesake (and"
"in some sort predecessor), there was another room used for the private"
stores and pieces of the officers. If I mistake not it was entered by
"that door to the right, but the key appears to be wanting!"""
"He added the last clause, as he watched the frantic efforts of Rollo,"
"who had immediately thrown himself upon the panels, while the Señor was"
in the act of rolling out his long-drawn Castilian elegances of
utterance.
"""Hither, Cardono,"" cried Rollo, ""open me this door! Quick, Sergeant!"""
"""Have a care,"" said the Duke; ""there is powder inside!"""
"But Rollo, now keen on the scent of weapons of defence, would not admit"
"a moment's delay, and the Sergeant, inserting his curiously crooked"
"blade, opened that door as easily as he had done the French window."
Muñoz stepped forward with some small show of eagerness and glanced
within.
"""Yes,"" he said, ""the officers' arms are there, and a liberal allowance"
"of powder."""
"""They are mostly sporting rifles,"" said Rollo, looking them over, ""but"
"there is certainly plenty of powder and ball."""
"""And what kills ibex and bouquetin on the sierras,"" drawled Muñoz, ""will"
into a better channel.[23] Such stories are so easy to recognise that
"it would be useless to make a formal list, but I shall make further"
allusion to this in dealing with stories from the lives of the saints.
"These, then, are the main elements to avoid in the selection of"
material suitable for normal children. Much might be added in the way
"of detail, and the special tendency of the day may make it necessary to"
avoid one class of story more than another; but this care belongs to
another generation of teachers and parents.
FOOTNOTES:
"[18] Such works as “Ministering Children,” “The Wide, Wide World,”"
"“The Fairchild Family,” are instances of the kind of story I mean, as"
containing too much analysis of emotion.
"[19] One child's favourite book bore the exciting title of “Birth, Life"
and Death of Crazy Jane.”
[20] This does not imply that the child would not appreciate in the
right context the thrilling and romantic story in connection with the
finding of the Elgin marbles.

innocent oaths. “But she was more than usual calm. She did not give a

presented his horse to the chief mourner. When asked why he bestowed

by them. This anecdote has become incorporated by the Chinese into a
"proverb, which they constantly quote: The Mother of Mentius seeks a"
neighbourhood.”
Another influence we have to counteract is that of newspaper headings
which catch the eye of children in the streets and appeal so powerfully
to their imagination.
Shakespeare has said:
"Tell me where is Fancy bred,"
"Or in the heart, or in the head?"
"How begot, how nourished?"
"Reply, reply."
It is engendered in the eyes
With gazing fed: and Fancy dies
In the cradle where it lies.
Let us all ring Fancy's knell.

"If this be true, it is of importance to decide what our children shall"
"look upon as far as we can control the vision, so that we can form some"
idea of the effect upon their imagination.
"Having alluded to the dangerous influence of the street, I should"
hasten to say that this influence is very far from being altogether
bad. There are possibilities of romance in street life which may have
just the same kind of effect on children as the telling of exciting
stories. I am indebted to Mrs. Arnold Glover (Hon. Sec. of the National
"Organisation of Girls' Clubs), one of the most widely informed people"

"she had reached the great dramatic moment, the child raised his hands"
"in terror and said: “Oh! Auntie, don't let the bear _really_ eat the"

"Here is a poem of James Stephens, showing a child's taste for"
sensational things:--
A man was sitting underneath a tree
"Outside the village, and he asked me"
"What name was upon this place, and said he"
Was never here before. He told a
Lot of stories to me too. His nose was flat.
"I asked him how it happened, and he said,"

"With a marling-spike one day, but he was dead,"
"And a jolly job too, but he'd have gone a long way to have"
killed him.
"A gold ring in one ear, and the other was bit off by a crocodile,"
"bedad,"
That's what he said: He taught me how to chew.
He was a real nice man. He liked me too.
The taste that is fed by the sensational contents of the newspapers
"and the dramatic excitement of street life, and some of the lurid"
"representations of the Kinematograph, is so much stimulated that the"

“What the insurance companies have to do to recover stolen

"Deputy O’Connor, it is the insurance companies rather than the police"

"Leaves simple and exstipulate, but sometimes dissected or provided"
with stipule-like auricles. Flowers seated upon a dilated or elevated
receptacle and arranged in sometimes spike-like or one-flowered
heads which are surrounded by an involucre. Heads either containing
"only hermaphrodite flowers, several of which are sometimes sterile"
"(male), or consisting of hermaphrodite or male central (disc-) flowers"
"and female or neuter marginal (ray-) flowers, more rarely heads"
unisexual or reduced to a single flower. Calyx-limb (pappus) formed
"of sometimes connate scales or hairs, fully developed only in fruit,"
"or wanting. Corolla of united petals, in the hermaphrodite and male"

"long, safe in the rest-house of the small mud fort at Saindak."
"The following morning, after a good night's rest, I had a long talk"
"with Idu, and the very favourable impression I had formed of the man"
the night before was greatly increased. I found him by daylight to be
"a highly intelligent-looking, splendidly proportioned fellow of about"
"five feet eight, with a big black beard. I had glimpses, even then,"
of the keen sense of humour which was to do so much to lighten the
difficulties of the ensuing campaign. Never once in all the months to
come did I find his wit and humour fail.
"As after-events proved he was absolutely invaluable. In fact, I often"
"called him, and told him that I called him, my ""head."" Not only did"
"he know every yard of the country, but he knew by name practically"
"every one of the Raiders, knew their peculiarities and their weak"
"points as well as their strength. Idu was a man in a million, and I"
"should like to think that, some day, this public appreciation of him,"
"and of what he did to help in this campaign, may reach him."
"After breakfast and my talk with Idu, we set out on the last march of"
"the first phase of my journey, and reached Robat by two o'clock in"
the afternoon.

A PLAN OF CAMPAIGN
of having the administration of all the Church’s property kept entirely
"at home, as in the time of Pius IX. Leo XIII had preferred to replace"
"this paternal method by a trained bureaucracy, but the Church had not"
"gained anything by it, and they had lost credit through unfortunate"
"negotiations, buying land and taking mortgages."
Cæsar realized that it was useless to attempt to convince a man of
"the intelligence and austerity of the Cardinal, and he listened to him"
respectfully.
"Monsignor Spada conversed amiably, he escorted them as far as the door,"
and shook hands when they said good-bye.
THE ABBÉ TARDIEU
Then they went to see the Abbé Tardieu. The abbé lived in the Piazza.
"Navona. His office, furnished in modern style, produced the effect of a"
"violent contrast with Cardinal Spada’s sumptuous study, and yet brought"
"it to mind. The Abbé Tardieu’s work-room was small, worldly, full of"
books and photographs.
"The abbé, a tall young man, thin, with a rosy face, a long nose, and a"
"mouth almost from ear to ear, had the air of an astute but jolly person,"
and laughed at everything said to him. He was liveliness personified.
When they entered his office he was writing and smoking.
"Cæsar explained about his financial knowledge, and how he had gone on"
"acquiring it, until he got to the point where he could discern a law, a"
"system, in things where others saw nothing more than chance. The Abbé"
"Tardieu promised that if he knew a way to utilize Cæsar’s knowledge, he"
"again and laughed softly as she made him sit, and herself sat upon his"
knee.
CHAPTER XXV.
THE TRUTH TOO LATE.
By four o'clock the next afternoon the Club had gathered ample materials
"for fresh gossip. The formalities attendant on the change of government,"
"the composition of the new Cabinet, the prospects of the election--these"
"alone would have supplied many hours, and besides them, indeed"
"supplanting them temporarily by virtue of an intenser interest, there"
"was the account of the inquest on Benyon's body. Medland had gone to it,"
"almost direct from his final interview with the Governor, and Kilshaw"
"had been there, fresh from a conference with Perry. The inquiry had"
"ended, as was foreseen directly Ned Evans' evidence was forthcoming, in"
a verdict of murder against Gaspard; but the interest lay in the course
"of the investigation, not in its issue. Mr. Duncombe, a famous comedian,"
who was then on tour in New Lindsey and had been made an honorary member
"of the Club, smacked his lips over the dramatic moment when the"
"ex-Premier, calmly and in a clear voice, had identified the person in"
"the photograph, declared the deceased man to have been Benyon, and very"
briefly stated how he had been connected with him in old days.
"""The lady,"" he said, ""is Mrs. Benyon. The other figure is that of"
"myself. I had not seen the deceased for many years."""
"""You were not on terms with him?"" asked the coroner, who, in common with"
"""You're free now to do as you like,"" he answered, and left her. He felt"
as if he were treading on air on his way back to the mid-ship saloon.
"Captain Dove, in the same _négligé_ costume, was busy at breakfast when"
"Slyne walked in upon him again, but looked up from his plate for long"
enough to mumble a malicious question.
"""Yes, I've fixed it all up with her,"" Slyne answered with assumed"
"nonchalance. ""You can always trust me to know how to handle a woman,"
"Dove."""
"Captain Dove shot a derisive glance in his direction. ""Is she willing to"
"marry you after all, then?"" he demanded, feigning a surprise by no means"
complimentary.
"""Not just at once, of course,"" returned his companion, and left the old"
man to infer whatever he pleased.
In response to a shouted order of Captain Dove's a slatternly
cook-steward brought Slyne a steaming platter of beans with a bit of
"bacon-rind on top, and an enamelled mug containing a brew which might,"
"by courtesy, have been called coffee. There was a tray of broken ship's"
"biscuits, a tin containing some peculiarly rank substitute for butter,"
"upon the table, with the other equally uninviting concomitants of a"
meagre meal.
"""_Tchk-tchk!_"" commented Slyne, and sat down to satisfy his hunger as"
"best he might; while Captain Dove, having overheard that criticism, eyed"
"him inimically, and proceeded to puff a peculiarly rank cigar in his"
face.
"""You might as well be getting dressed now,"" said Slyne indifferently."

72 points. Printers still estimate the length and width of a page or a
column by the pica; thus a page 4 inches wide is 24 picas.

"newspaper column widths, magazine columns, etc., is known as the em"

"faces, but the Scotch face, which is a cross between old-style and"
"modern, combines well with either."

"Islands, and after these were surrendered by the Dutch, Thomas Morgan was"
left in charge.
In 1686 he sailed in command of a company of buccaneers to assist Governor
"Wells, of St. Kitts, against the French. The defence of the island was"
"disgraceful, and Morgan's company was the only one which displayed any"
"courage or discipline, and most of them were killed or wounded, Colonel"
Morgan himself being shot in both legs.
Often these buccaneer leaders altered their titles from colonel to

"This, the greatest of all the ""brethren of the coast,"" was a Welshman,"
born at Llanrhymmy in Monmouthshire in the year 1635. The son of a
"well-to-do farmer, Robert Morgan, he early took to the seafaring life."
"When quite a young man Morgan went to Barbadoes, but afterwards he"
"settled at Jamaica, which was his home for the rest of his life."
"Morgan may have been induced to go to the West Indies by his uncle,"
"Colonel Morgan, who was for a time Deputy Governor of Jamaica, a post Sir"

"Morgan was a man of great energy, and must have possessed great power of"
winning his own way with people. That he could be absolutely unscrupulous
"when it suited his ends there can be little doubt. He was cruel at times,"

given in the suit for libel brought and won by Morgan against the

"As we left the Blake mansion, Kennedy remarked, “We must trace that car"
somehow—at least we must get someone working on that.”
Half an hour later we were in a towering office building on Liberty
"Street, the home of various kinds of insurance. Kennedy stopped before"
"a door which bore the name, “Douglas Garwood: Insurance Adjuster.”"
"Briefly, Craig told the story of the stolen car, omitting the account"
of the dastardly method taken to blackmail Mrs. Blake. As he proceeded
"a light seemed to break on the face of Garwood, a heavyset man, whose"
very gaze was inquisitorial.
"“Yes, the theft has been reported to us already by Dr. Wilson herself,”"
he interrupted. “The car was insured in a company I represent.”
"“I had hoped so,” remarked Kennedy, “Do you know the woman?” he added,"
watching the insurance adjuster who had been listening intently as he
told about the fair motor car thief.
"“Know her?” repeated Garwood emphatically. “Why, man, we have been so"
close to that woman that I feel almost intimate with her. The
"descriptions are those of a lady, well-dressed, and with a voice and"
"manner that would carry her through any of the fashionable hotels,"
perhaps into society itself.”
"“One of a gang of blackmailers, then,” I hazarded."
"Garwood shrugged his shoulders. “Perhaps,” he acquiesced. “It is"
"automobile thieving that interests me, though. Why,” he went on, rising"
"excitedly, “the gangs of these thieves are getting away with half a"

"""700,000 kilofrank-hours--all x."""
"Having thus checked and tested every function of his department,"
"Breckenridge plugged into ""Captain,"" and when the green light went on:"
"""Chief pilot check-out--all x,"" he reported briefly."
"""All x,"" acknowledged the speaker, and the chief pilot unplugged."
"Fifteen minutes remained, during which time one department head after"
another would report to the captain of the liner that everything in his
charge was ready for the stupendous flight.
"""All x, Steve?"" Breckenridge turned to the computer. ""How do you check"
"acceleration and power with the observatory?"""
"""Not so good, old bean,"" the younger man frowned in thought. ""They"
"figure like astronomers, not navigators. They've made no allowances for"
"anything, not even the reversal--and I figure four thousands for that"
"and for minor detours. Then there's check station errors...."""
"""Check-station errors! Why, they're always right--that's what they're"
"for!"""
"""Don't fool yourself--they've got troubles of their own, the same as"
"anybody else. In fact, from a study of the charts of the last few weeks,"
I'm pretty sure that E2 is at least four thousand kilometers this side
"of where he thinks he is, that W41 is ten or twelve thousand beyond his"
"station, and that they've both got a lateral displacement that's simply"
"fierce. I'm going to check up, and argue with them about it as we pass."
"Then there's another thing--they figure to only two places, and we've"
CHAPTER XXIX
A LITTLE QUEEN AT HOME
"Meanwhile, leaving the grave in the shaded corner of the farm garden, La"
Giralda went out with many strange things moving in her heart. More than
"once she had seen her own children laid in the dust, with far less of"
emotion than this nameless little girl clutching her wooden puppet and
"smiling, well-pleased, in the face of the Last Terror."
She found the donkey standing still and patient between his fagot
"bundles. The she-goats, on the other hand, had scattered a little this"
way or that as this blade of grass or that spray of _encina_ had allured
them. But a sharp cry or two called them together. For it was many hours
"since any of them had been milked, and the full teats standing out every"
way ached for the pressing fingers.
"The Sergeant had, of course, long since completely disappeared up the"
"hillside, so La Giralda, with one comprehensive look back at the"
"desolate farmhouse, drove her little flock before her towards the town"
"gates of San Ildefonso. Like a picture, the dustily red roofs lay"
"beneath in the sunshine, spire and roof-garden, pigeon-house and terrace"
"walk. Parts of the white palace of La Granja also were to be seen, but"
"indistinctly, since it lay amid a pleasant distraction of greenery, and"
the woods waved and the falling waters glimmered about it like the
landscape of a dream.
"From the _Colegiata_ came the tolling of a bell, slow and irregular. All"
"else was silent. Presently, with her little flock before her, La Giralda"
"wound communicated with the pleura, and the patients died from"
septicæmia mainly due to absorption from the surface of that membrane
(_Pleural septicæmia_).
"No. 190 is a most striking instance of spontaneous cure, since no doubt"
can exist that both rectum and bladder were perforated.
"(180*) _Injury to the cæcum and ascending colon._--Boer,"
"wounded at Graspan while sheltering behind a rock, lying on his"
back.
"_Entry_ (Lee-Metford), in right thigh, 3 inches below and 1"
"inch within anterior superior spine of ilium; _exit_, in back,"
on a level with the fourth lumbar spinous process and 3 inches
from that point.
Half an hour after the wound the patient commenced to suffer
severe stabbing pain; he lay on the field one hour; later he
"was taken to a Field hospital, and on the second day was sent"
by train a distance of twenty-five miles.
When seen at the end of fifty hours the condition was as
"follows. Face anxious, complexion dusky. Great abdominal pain,"
especially about the umbilicus. Vomiting frequent and
distressing; bowels confined since the accident; tongue dry and
"furred. Urine scanty. Pulse full and strong, 125; respirations,"
"entirely thoracic, 30."
"Abdomen generally distended and tympanitic, wall rigid and"
"motionless. Dulness in right flank, together with superficial"
oedema and emphysema.
"stay for his health's sake in the fresh sea-air; and when he yielded,"
"they prided themselves, after the manner of humans, on their own powers"
of persuasion. One morning Sir Oliver asked him point-blank:
“When are you going to Australia?”
"“I don't know,” said John. “There 's no immediate hurry.”"
"“I hope, dear,” said Julia, “you 'll give up the idea altogether.”"
"“Have n't I told you that I've made up my mind?” said John, in his gruff"
tone of finality.
“When are you going to break the news to Stella?” asked Sir Oliver.
"“Now,” said John, who had begun to loathe the mention of the doomful"
subject; and he stalked away--the three were strolling in the garden
"after breakfast--and went to Stella's room, and of course made no"
mention of it whatsoever.
"Then Herold came down for the week-end, and when he heard of Risca's"
pusillanimity he threw back his head and laughed for joy; for he knew
"that John would never go to Australia without telling Stellamaris, and"
also that if he could not tell Stellamaris in the first madness of his
"agony, he would never be able to tell her at all."
"And so, in fact, the fantastically absurd prevailed. Before the"
"Unwritten Law, mainly promulgated and enforced by Risca himself, which"
"guarded the sea-chamber against pain and sorrow, the driving Furies"
slunk with limp wing and nerveless claw. And one day Risca was surprised
"at finding himself undriven. Indeed, he was somewhat disconcerted. He"
fell into a bad temper. The Furies are highly aristocratic divinities
Concha smiled a subtle smile and turned her eyes upon the ground.
"""If you will remember, I had other matters to communicate to your"
"Excellency,"" she said meekly--almost too meekly, Rollo thought. ""This"
"matter of Luis Fernandez slipped my memory, till it was my good fortune"
"to be reminded of it by Don Ramon!"""
"And all the while the long lean Sergeant Cardono, his elbows glued to"
"his sides, sat his horse as if spiked to the saddle, and chuckled with"
quiet glee at the scene.
"""He will do yet,"" he muttered; ""'twas ever thus that my father told me"
of the Gran' Lor' before Salamanca. Be he as stiff as a ramrod and as
"frigid as his own North Pole, the little one will thaw him--bend"
him--make a fool of him for his soul's good. She is not an Andaluse of
"the gipsy blood for nothing! He will make him a soldier yet, this young"
"man, by the especial grace of San Vicente de Paul, only I do not think"
that either of them will deserve readmission to the Convent of the Holy
"Innocents!"""
More than once Rollo endeavoured to extract from Concha to what place
"her self-assumed mission was taking her, and at what point she would"
leave them. It was in vain. The lady baffled all his endeavours with the
most consummate ease.
"""You have not communicated to me,"" she said, ""the purport of your own"
"adventures. How then can I tell at what place our ways divide?"""
"""I am forbidden to reveal to any save General Cabrera alone my secret"
"instructions!"" said Rollo, with such dignity as he could muster at short"
notice.
"""Sunderland"" than it had hitherto been, since the distance between"
the two airships was less than a thousand yards and was visibly
decreasing.
"""They're going to take her in tow, by Jove!"" ejaculated Aubyn, who"
had brought his binoculars to play upon the scene.
Oswestry gave a snort that implied disbelief in his brother-officer's
"assertion, but presently he exclaimed:--"
"""Well, blest if you aren't right, old man. And a deuced smart move,"""
"he added, with a true sailor's admiration for a smart manoeuvre,"
whether executed by friend or foe.
"""What a chance for our seaplanes!"" said the torpedo lieutenant."
"""They ought to have been on the spot before this."""
"""They're on the way all right, Torps,"" declared the commander. ""I"
wouldn't mind betting a month's pay that they've spotted their
"quarry. By Jove, they've established communication!"""
The undamaged Zeppelin had circled round her consort and was now
forging gently ahead. An upward jerk of the other's bows announced
that the strain on the towing hawser was beginning to be felt.
"Gradually the hitherto uncontrollable airship began to gather way,"
both vessels rolling sluggishly in the light air-currents.
"The aerial searchlight had now been switched off, but by means of the"
rays directed from the British ships the progress of the two
"Zeppelins could be followed as their huge shapes, showing ghost-like"
"in the silvery light, moved slowly in a north-easterly direction."
Our talk began over Mr. Bruce Smith's notice of motion in the Australian
Parliament.
"'Yes, I have seen the proposal,' said Baron Suyematsu, 'and I am very"
glad an Australian representative has taken up the question. He proposes
to amend the Immigration Restriction Act so as to permit Japanese to
enter the Commonwealth. The reason given is that Japan has placed
"herself in the front rank of nations, has granted religious freedom, has"
"established consulates, and become the honoured ally of Great Britain. I"
understand that Australian papers are saying there is no chance of the
motion being carried. I care not whether the motion is carried or not
this time. Of one thing I am certain--it will be carried eventually.
'What reason has Australia for shutting out the Japanese?'
"'The dread of cheaper labour and of the ""Yellow Peril,"" as it is called."
"Whatever there be in that, it certainly does not apply to the Japanese."
"This is already being realised in Australia, as Mr. Bruce Smith's motion"
shows. The Japanese are making it clear that they have to be regarded by
Europeans in a different light from the rest of Asiatics. Europeans
consider themselves superior to all other races. I do not blame them for
"thinking that, for of modern civilisations theirs is certainly the best."
"But with the exception of the British people, Europeans have not yet"
realised that modern Japan is built up on European methods. She has no
"more to do with the so-called ""Yellow Peril"" than America has. She takes"
"her place by the side of the other powers, with very much the same"
civilisation as theirs. England having been the first to recognise the
"new Japan, I am certain her colonies will soon follow. That is why I"
feel it is only a question of time before Australia excludes Japan from
its Restriction Act.'
"George's brother, Count Anthony Hamilton. He had never been friendly to"
"his younger brother, and had ceased to look upon him as a brother at all"
after his disgraceful reformation. Then when the king turned against
"George, Anthony, good courtier that he was, turned likewise, and there is"
no bitterness that may be compared with that of an apostate brother.
"After we had talked for a minute or two, Count Anthony asked if I knew"
"anything of ""the fool,"" as he was pleased to call his brother."
"""I know nothing of your brother George, my lord, if it is him you mean."""
"""He is no brother of mine, and if you wish to become a member of our"
"family, you will cease to consider him your friend,"" returned his"
"Lordship, making an effort to conceal his anger."
"I was not in the mood to take his remark kindly, therefore I answered"
warmly:--
"""Shall my entering the ranks of your noble family curtail my privilege of"
"choosing my own friends?"""
"""No, with one exception,"" he replied."
"""The honor of the alliance is great, my lord, but I shall not consent to"
"even one exception at your dictation. Your sister, my future wife, loves"
"her brother, and if she does not object to my friendship for him, your"
"Lordship oversteps your authority, as head of your house, by protesting."""
"He turned angrily upon me, saying: ""You have been paying your court with"
"lukewarm ardor of late, Baron Clyde. Perhaps you would not grieve if your"
"friendship for a family outcast were to bar you from the family."""
"avenue, distancing the enthusiasts who would have had the horses out of"
"the shafts. They passed a long row of carriages, belonging to people who"
"had not feared to come and look on from a distance, and at last, knowing"
"the procession would go back another way, Medland bade his driver stop"
"under the trees, and lit a cigar."
"""And I wonder if it will all make any difference!"" said he, puffing"
delightedly. He had all an old political organiser's love for a big
"meeting, which does not exclude scepticism as to its value."
"""Oh, you gave it 'em finely,"" said the Treasurer."
"""I believe it'll frighten two or three anyhow,"" observed Norburn."
"""I _know_ we shall win to-morrow,"" cried Daisy, squeezing her father's"
arm.
"""Ah! here's a special Sunday evening paper--how we encourage"
"wickedness!"" said the Premier, seeing a newsvendor approaching. ""Let's"
"see what they say of us!"""
"""I've seen it all for myself,"" remarked Daisy, and she went on"
"chattering to the other two, who were ready to talk over every incident"
"of the meeting, as people who have been to meetings ever are. On they"
"went, reminding one another of the bald man in the third row who cheered"
"so lustily, of the fat woman who had somehow got into the front row and"
"fanned herself all the time, of rude things shouted about Messrs."
"Puttock and Coxon, and so forth. The Premier, listening with one ear,"
opened his paper; but the first thing he saw was not about his
"procession. He started and looked closer, then gave a sudden, covert"
"glance at his companions; they were busy in talk, and, with breathless"
"haste, he devoured the meagre details of Benham's wretched death. The"
"and is situated within Jiand's jurisdiction, although he is not the"
"actual owner of the town. The word Khwash literally means ""sweet,"""
"and, I believe, owes its name to the water, which is, by the way,"
quite warm when it appears at the surface of the ground in the
immediate vicinity.
"The Western portion of the Sarhad, extending roughly from Khwash to"
"Galugan, is held by the Ismailzais under their redoubtable leader,"
Juma Khan.
All three of these tribes possess approximately one thousand
"families apiece, and, of course, each family has many members, as"
"well as large numbers of camels, and herds of sheep and goats."
"Each of these tribes, at the time of which I write, could muster,"
"roughly, from one to two thousand riflemen, chiefly armed with Mauser"
"courage. As the man emerges upon the narrow platform, he is engulfed in"
"the swirling flakes, and often is pinned against the masonry so tightly"
by the wind that he cannot move a limb; at other times he is swept
"almost off his feet. While engaged in his freezing task, he also runs"
the risk of being drenched by a rising comber.

"The men on the lonely, exposed Tillamook Rock, off the Oregon coast,"
"have had more than one occasion to respect the storm-fiend. One night,"
"while a fearful gale was raging, a huge mass of rock was torn away from"
"the islet, snatched by the waves, and thrown high into the air. It"
"down to earth! Breathless, bewildered, lifted to a height of transport"
"beyond all words, Alwyn gazed upon her in entranced, devout"
"silence,--the vast cathedral seemed to swing round and round in great"
"glittering circles, and nothing was real, nothing steadfast, but that"
"slight, sweet maiden in her soft gray robes, with the Ardath-blossoms"
"gleaming white against her breast! Angel she was,--angel she ever would"
"be,--and yet--what did she SEEM? Naught but:"
"""A child-like woman, wise and very fair,"
"Crowned with the garland of her golden hair!"""
"This, and no more,--and yet in this was all earth and all heaven"
"comprised!--He gazed and gazed, overwhelmed by the amazement of his own"
"bliss,--he could have gazed upon her so in speechless ravishment for"
"hours, when, with a gesture of infinite grace and appeal, she stretched"
out her hands toward him:
"""Speak to me, dearest one!"" she murmured wistfully--""Tell me,--am I"
"welcome?"""
"""O exquisite humility!--O beautiful maiden-timid hesitation! Was"
"she,--even she, God's Angel, so far removed from pride, as to be"
uncertain of her lover's reception of such a gift of love? Roused from
"his half-swooning sense of wonder, he caught those gentle hands, and"
"laid them tenderly against his breast,--tremblingly, and all devoutly,"
"he drew the lovely, yielding form into his arms, close to his"
"heart,--with dazzled sight he gazed down into that pure, perfect face,"
those clear and holy eyes shining like new-created stars beneath the
soft cloud of clustering fair hair!
"""Welcome!"" he echoed, in a tone that thrilled with passionate awe and"
"ecstasy;--""My Edris! My Saint! My Queen! Welcome, more welcome than the"
"of Death coming in heroic form, as when a man or woman dies for a great"
"cause, in which he has opportunity of admiring courage, devotion and"
"unselfishness; or of Death coming as a result of treachery, such as"
"we find in the death of Baldur, of Siegfried, and of others, so that"
children may learn to abhor such deeds; but also a fair proportion of
"stories dealing with death that comes naturally, when our work is done"
"and our strength gone, which has no more tragedy than the falling of"
a leaf from the tree. In this way we can give children the first idea
that the individual is so much less than the whole.
Quite small children often take Death very naturally. A boy of five
met two of his older companions at the school door. They said sadly
"and solemnly: “We have just seen a dead man!” “Well,” said the little"
"philosopher, “that's all right. We've _all_ got to die when our work's"
done.”
"In one of the Buddha stories which I reproduce at the end of this book,"
"the little Hare (who is, I think, a symbol of nervous Individualism)"
"constantly says: “Suppose the Earth were to fall in, what would become"
of me?”
"As an antidote to the ordinary attitude towards death, I commend an"
"episode from a German folk-lore story called “Unlucky John,” which is"
included in the list of stories recommended at the end of this book.
The following sums up in poetic form some of the material necessary for
the wants of a child:
THE CHILD.
"The little new soul has come to Earth,"
convinced than ever before that there were at least distinct periods of
_good_ fortune in every man's life.
"Before reaching Gravesend, we halted at a grassy spot near the river"
"bank, where we ate our dinner. When the horses had rested, we set off for"
"Rochester, in which place we expected to spend the night at the Maid's"
"Garter, a famous old inn kept by a friend of Pickerings."
I had noticed a twinkle in Pickering's eyes when he directed us to go to
"this tavern, but did not understand the cause of his merriment until I"
"learned that by a curious old custom, a maid seeking entrance for the"
first time must contribute one of her garters before being admitted. The
worst feature of the usage was that the garter must be taken off at the
"door, and then and there presented to the porter, who received it on the"
point of his official staff.
"After entering Rochester, we went to the Maid's Garter and at once drove"
"into the courtyard, as the custom is with travellers intending to remain"
all night.
"When we left the coach and started to climb the steps to the great door,"
we found the landlord and his retinue waiting to receive us. Frances was
"in the lead, and when we reached the broad, flat stone in front of the"
"door, the head porter stepped before her, bowed, and asked humbly:--"
"""Is my lady maid or madam?"""
"Frances looked up in surprise, and he repeated his question."
"""What is that to you, fellow?"" asked Frances."
"""It is this, my lady,"" returned the porter. ""If my lady be a maid, she"
I am glad to add that the views we hold seem to have come at last to be
shared by the more responsible part of the French amongst the
"governmental circle, as well as by the general public. The newspapers"
"which are still sticking to their old contention are very few in number,"
and they seem to have some particular reasons of their own. I can never
think a nation like France could consciously and wilfully offend against
"justice and equity, and the only thing we anxiously hope for is that the"
declaration of the French Government may be honestly and effectually
"followed up. Whatever may be one's intention, the drift of events often"
"creates unlooked-for incidents, and that too often against one's will,"
when it is too late to avoid the consequences. Let all parties concerned
be careful in this matter of vital importance.

You ask my opinion on the future of the Yellow Peril cry. From an
ethical point of view it is an unjust and unreasonable accusation. From
a practical point of view it is idle and useless talk.
I have spoken and written on these particular points so often that I do
"not feel inclined to reiterate any more. I will, however, consider the"
matter from a different point of view and solicit any answer which may
be advanced against my conviction. I do not do this from any thought of
vanity; I should be very sorry if it were ever taken in that sense. I

GUESSWORK
"Cary tried to shake my resolution, but I was obdurately silent. While"
"he canvassed the whole position, bringing to bear his really profound"
knowledge of naval equipment and routine--and incidentally helping me
greatly to realise the improbability of my own guesswork solution--I
was able to maintain an air of lofty superiority. I must have
"aggravated him intensely, unpardonably, for I was his guest. He ought"
to have kicked me out. Yet he bore with me like the sweet-blooded
"kindly angel that he is, and when at the end it appeared that I was"
"right after all, Cary was the first to pour congratulations and honest"
admiration upon me. If he reads this book he will know that I am
repentant--though I must confess that I should behave in just the same
abominable way if the incident were to occur again. There is no great
value in repentance such as this.
"We reached Dawson's office in the early afternoon, and found his chief"
"assistant there, but no Dawson. ""The old man,"" remarked that officer,"
"a typical, stolid, faithful detective sergeant, ""is out on the"
rampage. He ought by rights to sit here directing the staff and leave
"the outside investigations to me. He is a high-up man, almost a deputy"
"assistant commissioner, and has no call to be always disguising"
himself and playing his tricks on everybody. I suppose you know that
"white-haired old gent down here ain't a bit like Bill Dawson, who's"

TRAPPING AN ABORIGINE
In houses and clothing the Darien Indians are decidedly primitive]

Death came fast to those in the jungle. The agonies they suffered from
"starvation, exposure and insect pests baffle description. “Truxton in"
"casting his eyes on the ground saw a toad”, wrote the historian."
"“Instantly snatching it up, he bit off the head and, spitting it away,"
"devoured the body. Maury looked at him a moment, and then picked up the"
"rejected head, saying, ‘Well, Truxton, you are getting quite particular."
"Something of an epicure, eh’? With these words he quietly devoured the"
head himself.”
Nine of the twenty-seven men who entered the Darien with Strain died.
"When the leader returned with the relief party they were found, like"
"Greely at Camp Starvation, unable to move and slowly dying. Those who"
retained life never fully regained strength. Every condition which
brought such frightful disaster upon the Strain party exists in the
"Darien today. The Indians are as hostile, the trails as faintly"
"outlined, the jungle as dense, the insects as savage. Only along the"
"banks of the rivers has civilization made some little headway, but the"
richest gold field twenty miles back in the interior is as safe from
civilized workings as though it were walled in with steel and guarded by
dragons. Every speculative man you meet in Panama will assure you that
the gold is there but all agree that conditions must be radically
changed before it can be gotten out unless a regiment and a subsistence
enthusiasms.
"And the faces that pass, with lingering glance out of the dusk, the"
pale sweet faces of thy beautiful women and the handsome figures of a
"vigorous race, how much larger vastnesses are in the communion of these"
eyes than in wide empty spaces of unthinking continents!
The mystic dusk turns thy many habitations to a thousand shadowy
"palaces, thy very vulgarities to dulcet musicalities. What comedies are"
in the making in thy wide hospitable lap to-night! what tragedies! what
heroic strivings! what bemeaning indecencies! what crimes!
Thy very mud holds something of dark mysterious lustre--being that
which is trod out of thy pageant and thy history.
"He only loves thee best who, being divorced from thee, comes to"
thee again out of the years. He flips thy mantle with no cockney
"familiarity, but hears in the hollows of his reverent ears the æolian"
whisperings of thy large significance....
"The sound of footsteps ceased to rouse the echoes in the empty street,"
as Noll came to a halt before Netherby Gomme’s doorway. He hesitated
for a moment; ran up the steps; and rang the bell.
"The smoky twilight that held the place was passing into sooty darkness,"
turning the staid street of lodging-houses into a way of fairy
"habitations, the lemon flames of gas-lamps showing a sweeping curve"
of light down its long length to the far rumble of the city’s distant
traffic.
A key coughed in its wards as it shot back the bolts of the lock; and
If an ewe gives birth to a lion with the horny exuberance of an ibex

If an ewe gives birth to a lion with the horny exuberance of an ibex
"on its face and if the eyes are open[74], prices will be high."
"If an ewe gives birth to a lion with fatty flesh on the nose, the"

"If an ewe gives birth to a lion, and the right temple is covered with"
"fatty flesh, the land will be richly blessed."
"If an ewe gives birth to a lion, and the left temple is covered with"
"fatty flesh,--rivalry."
"If an ewe gives birth to a lion, and it is covered all over with"
"fatty flesh, the king will be without a rival."
"If an ewe gives birth to a lion but without a head[75], death of the"
ruler.
"If an ewe gives birth to a lion with the gorge torn off[76],"
"destruction of the land, the mistress[77] will die."
If an ewe gives birth to a lion with the gorge torn off and a
"mutilated tail[78], the land [will be destroyed (?)]"
From texts like these it would appear that the phrase of 'an ewe giving
birth to a lion' had acquired a purely conventional force to describe a
lamb whose head or general features suggested those of a lion. It may have
come to be used indeed for a newly born lamb of unusually large
proportions. Hence one could combine with the description of a lion-lamb
LIKE A FALLING STAR
"Rollo judged aright. It was indeed no time for love-making, and, to do"
"the young man justice, he did not connect any idea so concrete with the"
impulsive kiss he had given to Concha.
She it was who had saved his life at Sarria. She was perilling her own
in order to accompany and assist his expedition. She had drawn up the
"ladder he had foolishly forgotten. Yet, in spite of the fact that he was"
"a young man and by no means averse from love, Rollo was so clean-minded"
"and so little given to think himself desirable in the eyes of women,"
that it never struck him that the presence of La Giralda and Concha
might be interpreted upon other and more personal principles than he had
modestly represented to himself.
"True, Rollo was vain as a peacock--but not of his love-conquests."
"Punctilious as any Spaniard upon the smallest point of honour, in a"
quarrel he was as ready as a Parisian _maître d'armes_ to pull out sword
or pistol. Nevertheless when a man boasted in his presence of the
"favours of a woman, he thought him a fool and a braggart--and was in"
general nowise backward in telling him so.
"Thus it happened that, though Concha had received no honester or better"
"intentioned kiss in her life, the giver of it went about his military"
"duties with a sense of having said his prayers, or generally, having"
performed some action raising himself in his own estimation.
"""God bless her,"" he said to himself, ""I will be a better man for her"
"sweet sake. And, by heavens, if I had had such a sister, I might have"
"been a better fellow long ere this! God bless her, I say!"""
"Charing Cross, and he surprised me with an invitation to his house"
that night to meet Monsieur l'Abbé du Boise at supper.
"""The king and a dozen other gentlemen will be present,"" he said, ""but"
"there will be no ladies. Monsieur l'Abbé, being of the church, is not a"
"ladies' man, and besides, ladies have sharper eyes than men, and might"
"see much that is intended to remain unseen."""
"The count's remark seemed to settle the question of the Abbé's identity,"
and I hastened to Frances with the news. She assured me that she was
"ready to die of fright, but showed no outward sign of dissolution, and"

There is one cause and one cause only of the decline in the birth-rate
and the beginning of the country’s spiritual and material suicide.
The way of Nature is for every species to increase nearly to its
"possible maximum of numbers. This is a proved law, and nothing but the"
"limitation of families by artificial means, or infanticide, can check"
its operation.
"The truth is exactly as Dr. Barry put it nearly two years ago, “It"
GNEISS is the general name under which are comprised coarsely
foliated rocks banded with irregular layers of feldspar and other
minerals. The gneisses appear to be due in many cases to the
"crushing and shearing of deep-seated igneous rocks, such as"
granite and gabbro.
"THE CRYSTALLINE SCHISTS, representing the finer types of"
"foliation, consist of thin, parallel, crystalline leaves, which"
are often remarkably crumpled. These folia can be distinguished
from the laminae of sedimentary rocks by their lenticular form and
"lack of continuity, and especially by the fact that they consist"
"of platy, crystalline grains, and not of particles rounded by"
wear.
"MICA SCHIST, the most common of schists, and in fact of all"
"infection, absorption taking place from the large foul cavity"
behind the colon. As the cavity in part surrounded the
"descending duodenum, this possibly accounted for the attack of"
vomiting which preceded death.
(181*) _Ascending colon._--Wounded at Graspan while lying in
"prone position. _Entry_ (Mauser), over ninth rib in line of"
"right linea semilunaris; _exit_, in right buttock, just below"
and behind the top of the great trochanter.
"The injury was followed by little abdominal pain, but a strange"
sensation of local gurgling was noted. The bowels acted as soon
"as the patient reached camp, some hours after being wounded."
There was no sickness and nothing abnormal was noted in the
"motions, except that they were loose and light-coloured."
On the evening of the third day the patient came under
observation in the ambulance train for Capetown. He looked
"somewhat anxious and ill, but he complained of little pain; the"
"temperature was 102°, pulse 88, fair strength, soft and"
"regular. There was local dulness, tenderness, and deficiency of"
"movement in the right iliac region. As it was night, he was"
removed from the train and an operation was performed the next
morning.
"Prior to operation the condition was as follows: Pulse 84,"
"temperature 100°; respiration easy, 20. Tongue moist, but"
"thickly coated in centre. Abdomen moves fairly, and is"
"resonant, except in right lower quadrant. No distension."
"Dulness, tenderness, and rigidity in right iliac region, marked"
to outer side of cæcum. Entry wound nearly and exit quite
healed. Cannot flex right thigh. The following operation was
"cut, with a ring of everted mucous membrane, and the wall of"
the bowel in the neighbourhood was thickened. All three
openings were included within a length of 2-1/2 inches. There
was no surrounding ecchymosis of the bowel wall. Very little
escaped intestinal contents were found in the situation of the
"bowel. The latter had apparently been retracted upwards, and"
lay to the left of the lumbar spine. The wounds were readily
"closed by five Lembert's sutures, three crossing the openings,"
and one at each end. The belly was then washed out with boiled
water and closed. The delay in finding the wounds due to the
mistaken impression that they would be found in the pelvis
"materially prolonged the operation, which lasted an hour and a"
"half. The patient never rallied, and died seventeen hours"
later. It is possible that a wound in the sigmoid flexure was
present which had already closed at the time of operation.
"(166*) Wounded at Magersfontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), opposite"
"central point of left ilium; _exit_, 1-1/2 inch above the"
centre of the right Poupart's ligament. Vomiting commenced soon
"after the injury, and this was continuous until the patient's"
"arrival in the Stationary hospital on the fourth day, when the"
condition was as follows:--
"Face extremely anxious in expression. Temperature 101°,"
"sweating freely. Pulse 110, fair strength. Tongue moist."
"Abdomen much distended, rigid, motionless, tympanitic"
throughout. Bowels confined. No urine had been passed for
"twenty-four hours, [Symbol: ounce]ij in bladder on"
"catheterisation, clear, and containing no blood."
Abdominal section. Median incision. A considerable quantity of
bloody effusion was evacuated. Intestine generally congested
"""Hurt, old man?"" asked Terence."
"""Not a bit,"" replied Waynsford coolly. ""They clipped a couple of"
"stays just as I was getting out of range. But we did the trick, by"
"Jove! Blew the railway station to Jericho."""
"""Hurry up,"" interposed Terence. ""She's going."""
The young airman methodically gathered together several important
"instruments, and giving a final look round at the aircraft that had"
"served him so faithfully, stepped into the waiting ""Carley."""
Before the men had pulled five yards the wrecked machine gave a lurch
and capsized completely. Supported by trapped air in the partially
"intact float the seaplane sank slowly, and with hardly a ripple"
disappeared from view.
With the least possible delay rescuers and rescued were taken on
"board the cruiser. Gathering way the ""Sunderland"" steamed in a"
westerly direction in order to baffle the range of the shore
"batteries, using her after guns with terrific speed."
Somewhat unceremoniously leaving his friend Terence hastened towards
the bridge. Just as he was abreast of the wreckage of the shattered
"funnel a deafening detonation, that completely surpassed the roar of"
"the cruiser's guns, seemed to burst over his head. Staggering under"
the blast of the explosion and temporarily blinded by the pungent
"smoke, the lieutenant groped his way until his progress was checked"
by a jagged mass of plating rendered almost red-hot by the impact of
a huge shell.
"Recoiling, he stood stock still for quite thirty seconds, his senses"
"struck the water almost under the cruiser's bows, and a waft of"
"evil-smelling gas drifted across the navigation bridge, causing"
officers and men to cough and gasp for breath.
"The captain tried to give an order, but was unable to utter a sound."
Mutely he signed for the helm to be put hard over.
Terence understood. Literally groping his way through the thick
"vapour, that even in the darkness showed an unmistakable greenish"
"hue, he found the quartermaster, who was clutching his throat and"
struggling for breath.
Pushing the man aside Aubyn rapidly revolved the steam steering-gear.
"Obediently the cruiser swung round, narrowly escaping a high"
"explosive missile that, had she maintained her course, would have"
played havoc with her fo'c'sle.
"All around the ""Sunderland"" the destroyers were dodging hither and"
thither in order to attempt to avoid the hail of bombs that rained
from the sky. It was little short of a miracle that collisions did
"not take place, for owing to the darkness, the suffocating fumes from"
"the missiles, and to the fact that most of the helmsmen were"
"temporarily blinded and choked, all attempt at formation was out of"
the question.
From the after-bridge of the cruiser a searchlight flashed skywards.
For a few seconds even its powerful rays failed to penetrate the pall
"of smoke, till an eddying gust freed the ""Sunderland"" from the"
noxious fumes.
Then the source of the mysterious missiles was revealed. At a height
of over two thousand feet were a couple of Zeppelins. Taking
any serious commiseration.
"When he did come to death-grapple with the absolute, the beasts above"
"mentioned, he stood out a tragic young figure, fiercely alone in the"
"arena, save for Herold."
"His name, uncommon and arresting, had one connotation in London--the"
"Case, the appalling and abominable Case. Even Ferguson of the “Daily"
"Herald,” who had evinced such sympathy for him at first, shrank from the"
name at the head of the weekly column and suggested the temporary use of
"a pseudonym. Had it not been for Herold's intervention, Risca would have"
told Ferguson to go to the devil and would have refused to work for his
"Philistine paper. He swallowed the insult, which did him no good. He"
refused to carry the accursed name into the haunts of men.
"“Come to the club, at any rate,” Herold urged. “Every man there is loyal"
to you.”
“And every man as he looks at me will have on his retina not a picture
"of me, but a picture of what went on in that house in Smith Street.”"
"“Oh, go and buy a serviceable epidermis,” cried Herold. Argument was"
useless.
So Risca worked like a mole at anonymous journalism in his shabby
lodgings where Lilias and Niphetos were suggested only by a mangy tabby
"who occasionally prowled into his sitting-room, and Arachne presided,"
"indeed, but in the cobwebs about the ceiling in the guise which she had"
been compelled to take by the angry god when the world was young. Only
"when his attendance at the office of the weekly review was necessary,"
"such as on the day when it went to press, did he mingle with the busy"
world.
"He gave way to much emotion. Vivie, though still dazed with the"
"reverberating horror of Edith Cavell's execution, tried to regain"
her mind balance and thank him for the kindness he had shown them.
But it was now necessary to see her mother who might also be
undergoing a shock. As she walked up to their bedroom she reflected
that the departure of von Giesselin would have to be followed by
their own exile to some other lodging. They would share in his
disgrace.
The next morning in fact the Belgian manager of the hotel with many
regrets gave them a month's warning. The hotel would be required for
some undefined need of the German Government and he had been told no
one could be lodged there who was not furnished with a permit from
the Kommandantur.
For three weeks Vivie sought in vain for rooms. Every suitable place
was either full or else for reasons not given they were refused. She
"was reduced to eating humble pie, to writing once more to Gräfin von"
Stachelberg and imparting the dilemma in which they were placed. Did
this kind lady know where a lodging could be obtained? She herself
"could put up with any discomfort, but her mother was ill. If she"
"could help them, Vivie would humbly beg her pardon for her angry"
letter of three weeks ago and resume her hospital work. Minna von
Stachelberg made haste to reply that there were some things better
not discussed in writing: if Vivie could come and see her at six one
"evening, when she had a slight remission from work--"
"Vivie went. Out of hearing, Gräfin von Stachelberg--who, however, to"
"facilitate intercourse, begged Vivie to call her ""Minna,""--""We may"
"all be dead, my dear, before long of blood-poisoning, bombs from"
"coquetry showing through her grave demeanour, ""a secret mission from the"
Mother Superior of the Convent of the Holy Innocents. Do not attempt to
penetrate the secret. I assure you it will be quite useless. And pray do
"not suppose that only you can adventure forth on perilous quests!"""
"""I assure you,"" began Rollo, eagerly, ""that I suppose no such thing. At"
the moment when you came up I was wishing with all my heart that the
responsibility of the present undertaking had been laid on any other
"shoulders than mine!"""
"Yet in spite of his modesty, certain it is that from that moment Rollo"
rode no longer with his head hanging down like a willow blown by the
wind. The reins lay no more lax and abandoned on his horse's neck. On
"the contrary, he sat erect and looked abroad with the air of a"
"commander, and his hand rested oftener on the hilt of Killiecrankie,"
with the air of pride which Concha privately thought most becoming.
"""And in what case left you my wife and babe?"" suddenly demanded El"
"Sarria, riding up, and inquiring somewhat imperiously of the new"
recruit concerning the matter which touched him most nearly.
"""The Señora Dolóres is safe with the good sisters, and as in former"
"times I was known to have been her companion, it was judged safest that"
I should not longer be seen in the neighbourhood. Likewise I was charged
with the tidings that Luis Fernandez with a company of Cristino
"Migueletes has been seen riding southward to cut you off from Madrid,"
"whither it is supposed you are bound!"""
Rollo turned quickly upon her with some anger in his eye.
"""Why did you not tell me that at first?"" he said."
was thanking his stars that at any rate the professional scientists
"weren't responsible for this job. Like the grizzled general, he'd"
"always felt suspicious of men who kept telling you how to do things,"
rather than doing them themselves. In World War III he'd had his fill
"of the professional physicists, with their eternal taint of a misty"
sort of radicalism and free-thinking. The Thinkers were better--more
"disciplined, more human. They'd called their brain-machine Maizie,"
which helped take the curse off her. Somewhat.
*       *       *       *       *
"The President's Secretary, a paunchy veteran of party caucuses, was"
"also glad that it was the Thinkers who had created the machine, though"
he trembled at the power that it gave them over the Administration.
"Still, you could do business with the Thinkers. And nobody (not even"
the Thinkers) could do business (that sort of business) with Maizie!
Before that great square face with its thousands of tiny metal
"features, only Jorj Helmuth seemed at ease, busily entering on the"
tape the complex Questions of the Day that the high officials had
"handed him: logistics for the Endless War in Pakistan, optimum size for"
"next year's sugar-corn crop, current thought trends in average Soviet"
"minds--profound questions, yet many of them phrased with surprising"
"simplicity. For figures, technical jargon, and layman's language were"
alike to Maizie; there was no need to translate into mathematical
"shorthand, as with the lesser brain-machines."
The click of the taper went on until the Secretary of State had twice
nervously fired a cigaret with his ultrasonic lighter and twice quickly
put it away. No one spoke.
"Jorj looked up at the Secretary of Space. ""Section Five, Question"
"into balls at the approach of danger. It is in this attitude,"
"taken at the approach of death, that trilobites are often found in"
the Ordovician and later rocks. The gigantic crustaceans called
the EURYPTERIDS were also present in this period.
The arthropods had now seized upon the land. Centipedes and
"insects of a low type, the earliest known land animals, have been"
discovered in strata of this system.
BRYOZOANS. No fossils are more common in the limestones of the
time than the small branching stems and lacelike mats of the
"bryozoans,--the skeletons of colonies of a minute animal allied in"
structure to the brachiopod.
"BRACHIOPODS. These multiplied greatly, and in places their shells"
formed thick beds of coquina. They still greatly surpassed the
mollusks in numbers.
CEPHALOPODS. Among the mollusks we must note the evolution of the
cephalopods. The primitive straight Orthoceras has now become
abundant. But in addition to this ancestral type there appears a
"succession of forms more and more curved and closely coiled, as"
"illustrated in Figure 285. The nautilus, which began its course in"
"this period, crawls on the bottom of our present seas."
VERTEBRATES. The most important record of the Ordovician is that
"of the appearance of a new and higher type, with possibilities of"
development lying hidden in its structure that the mollusk and the
insect could never hope to reach. Scales and plates of minute
"fishes found in the Ordovician rocks near Canon City, Colorado,"
show that the humblest of the vertebrates had already made its
appearance. But it is probable that vertebrates had been on the
"however, when he was asleep, an incident happened that warned the Girl"
that it was necessary to get her lover away just as soon as he was able
to ride a horse.
"Lying on the rug in front of the fire she had been thinking of him when,"
"suddenly, her quick ear, more than ever alert in these days, caught the"
sound of a stealthy footstep outside the cabin. With no fear whatever
"except in relation to the discovery of her lover, the Girl went"
noiselessly to the window and peered out into the darkness. A man was
making signs that he wished to speak with her. For a moment she stood
"watching in perplexity, but almost instantly her instinct told her that"
"one of that race, for she believed the man to be a Mexican, would never"
dare to come to her cabin at that time of night unless it was on a
friendly errand. So putting her face close to the pane to reassure
"herself that she had not been mistaken in regard to his nationality, she"
"then went to the door and held it wide open for the man to enter, at the"
same time putting her finger to her lips as a sign that he should be
very still.
"""What are you doin' here? What do you want?"" she asked in a low voice,"
at the same time leading him to the side of the room further away from
her lover.
"Jose Castro's first words were in Spanish, but immediately perceiving"
"that he failed to make her understand, he nodded comprehendingly, and"
said:
"""All righta--I espeak Engleesh--I am Jose Castro too well known to the"
"_Maestro_. I want to see 'im."""
The Girl's intuition told her that a member of the band stood before
"her, and she regarded him suspiciously. Not that she believed that he"
them--and with the informality of adversity the three captives began
to talk. Swiftly Brand got a little knowledge of Greca's position on
"Jupiter, and of the racial history that led up to it."
*       *       *       *       *
Four of the nine satellites of Jupiter were now the home of living
"beings. But two only, at the dawn of history as Greca knew it, had"
been originally inhabited. These were the fourth and the second.
"On the fourth there dwelt a race, ""like me,"" as Greca put it--a"
"kindly, gentle people content to live and let live."
"On the second had been a race of immensely tall, but attenuated and"
physically feeble things with great heads and huge dull eyes and
characters distinguished mainly for cold-blooded savagery.
The inhabitants of the fourth satellite had remained in ignorance of
"the monsters on the second till one day ""many, many ages ago,"" a fleet"
of clumsy ships appeared on the fourth satellite. From the ships had
"poured thousands of pipe-like creatures, armed with horrible rods of"
"metal that killed instantly and without a sound. The things, it"
"seemed, had crowded over the limits of their own globe, and had been"
forced to find more territory.
They had made captive the entire population of the satellite.
Then--for like all dangerous vermin they multiplied rapidly--they had
overflowed to the first and fifth satellites--the others were
uninhabitable--and finally to the dangerous surface of Jupiter itself.
"Everywhere they had gone, they had taken droves of Greca's people to"
"be their slaves, ""and the source of their food,"" added Greca, with a"
shudder; a statement that was at the moment unintelligible to the two
afterwards rejoined Wafer.
"SPRIGGS, CAPTAIN FRANCIS FARRINGTON."
An uninteresting and bloody pirate without one single redeeming character.
"He learnt his art with the pirate Captain Lowther, afterwards serving as"
quartermaster with Captain Low and taking an active part in all the
barbarities committed by the latter.
"About 1720 Low took a prize, a man-of-war called the _Squirrel_. This he"
"handed over to some of the crew, who elected Spriggs their captain. The"
"ship they renamed the _Delight_, and in the night altered their course and"
"left Low. They made a flag, bearing upon it a white skeleton, holding in"
"one hand a dart striking a bleeding heart, and in the other an hourglass."
"Sailing to the West Indies, Spriggs took several prizes, treating the"
crews with abominable cruelty. On one occasion the pirates chased what
"they believed to be a Spanish ship, and after a long while they came"
alongside and fired a broadside into her. The ship immediately
"surrendered, and turned out to be a vessel the pirate had plundered only a"
"few days previously. This infuriated Spriggs and his crew, who showed"
their disappointment by half murdering the captain. After a narrow escape
"from being captured by a French man-of-war near the Island of St. Kitts,"
"Spriggs sailed north to the Summer Isles, or Bermudas. Taking a ship"
"coming from Rhode Island, they found her cargo to consist of horses."
Several of the pirates mounted these and galloped up and down the deck
until they were thrown. While plundering several small vessels of their
"cargo of logwood in the Bay of Honduras, Spriggs was surprised and"
"attacked by an English man-of-war, and the pirates only escaped by using"
their sweeps. Spriggs now went for a cruise off the coast of South
"Carolina, returning again to Honduras. This was a rash proceeding on"
We were shown everything that we desired to see except the
transmission room and the upper conning tower--the twin holy of holies
"in a commissioned ship--and slipped away, escaping the Captain by a"
"bare two minutes. Which was lucky, as he would probably have had us"
"thrown into the ""ditch."""
"The end of the day was as weariful as the beginning, and we were all"
"glad--especially, I expect, Mrs. Cary--to go early to bed. That"
"ill-used lady, to whom we could disclose nothing of our anxieties,"
must have found us wretched company.
We had finished breakfast the next morning--the Saturday of Dawson's
gamble--and were sitting on Cary's big fireguard talking of every
"subject, except the one which had kept us awake at night, when a"
servant entered and announced that a soldier was at the door with a
"message from Mr. Dawson. ""Show him in,"" almost shouted Cary, and I"
"jumped to my feet, stirred for once into a visible display of"
eagerness.
"A Marine came in, dressed in the smart blue sea kit that I love; upon"
his head the low flat cap of his Corps. He gave us a full swinging
"salute, and jumped to attention with a click of his heels. He looked"
"about thirty-five, and wore a neatly trimmed dark moustache. His hair,"
"also very dark, was cropped close to his head. Standing there with his"
"hands upon the red seams of his trousers, his chest well filled out,"
"and his face weather tanned, he looked a proper figure of a sea-going"
"soldier. ""Mr. Cary, sir,"" he said, in a flat, monotonous orderly's"
"voice, ""Major Boyle's compliments, and could you and your friend come"
down to the Police Station to meet him and Chief Inspector Dawson. I
"have a taxi-cab at the door, sir."""
"""Certainly,"" cried Cary; ""in two minutes we shall be ready."""
"terms I don't think they could have agreed for ten minutes. As it was,"
"they had serious differences at times, which, however, I believe were"
all ultimately and happily adjusted.'
"The visits to his uncle's home, and the attractive young lady whom he"
"there met, must have largely contributed to Ferrier's happiness in"
these years of mental fermentation. Such times come in many men's lives
"when youth is turning into manhood, and powers are wakening up within"
that seem as though they would lead us we know not whither. And so it
may have been with Ferrier. But he was endowed with considerable
"calmness and self-command, combined with a confidence in his powers"
sufficient to carry him through many difficulties that might otherwise
"have got the better of him. Wilson's home, Elleray, near the Lake of"
"Windermere, was the centre of a circle of brilliant stars. Ferrier"
"recollected, while still a lad of seventeen years of age, meeting there"
"at one time, in the summer of 1825, Scott, Wordsworth, Lockhart, and"
"Canning, a conjunction difficult to beat.[4] Once more, we are told,"
"and on a sadder occasion, he came into association with the greatest"
Scottish novelist. 'It was on that gloomy voyage when the suffering man
"was conveyed to Leith from London, on his return from his ill-fated"
"foreign journey. Mr. Ferrier was also a passenger, and scarcely dared"
to look on the almost unconscious form of one whose genius he so warmly
admired.' The end was then very near.
"[4] This meeting occurred after the Irish tour of Scott,"
"Miss Anne Scott, and Lockhart, when they visited Wilson at"
"Elleray. Canning was staying at Storre, in the"
neighbourhood.
"Professor Ferrier's daughter tells us that long after, in the summer of"
"1856, the family went to visit the English Lakes, the centre of"
"attraction being Elleray, Mr. Ferrier's old home and birthplace. 'The"
and Gaspard bade him good-night in a cheery voice as they passed him.
The doorkeeper stood and watched the pair for a minute as they left the
Square and turned down a narrow street which led to the poorer part of
"the town, and thence to the quays. He heard Gaspard's high-pitched voice"
"and shrill laughter, and, in answer, Benham's thick tones and heavy"
"shout of drunken mirth. Once or twice these sounds repeated themselves,"
then they ceased; the footsteps of the Frenchman and his companion died
"away in the distance. The doorkeeper went on his way, thinking with"
"relief that Mr. Gaspard, for all his tall talk, was more at home with a"
bottle than with a knife or a bomb.
"Notwithstanding his dissipation, Gaspard was afoot very early in the"
"morning. It was hardly light, and the deep scratch of finger-nails on"
his face--it is so awkward when drunken fools wake at the wrong
minute--attracted no attention from the few people he encountered. He
"did not give them long to look at him, for he hurried swiftly through"
"the streets, towards the quays where the ships lay loading their"
"cargoes. He seemed to have urgent business to transact down there,"
"business that would brook no delay, and that was, if one might guess"
"from his uneasy glances over his shoulder, of a private nature. With one"
"hand he held tight hold of something in his trousers pocket, the other"
"rested on his belt, hard by a little revolver. In his business it is"
necessary to be ready for everything.
"Meanwhile Mr. Benham, having no affairs to trouble him, and no more"
"business to transact, stayed where he was."
CHAPTER XIX.
"“It's rather a mad notion, is n't it?”"
"“I don't think so at all,” replied Miss Lindon in a most disconcertingly"
matter-of-fact tone. “The only thing is that since poor papa died I've
"had so little to do with gentlemen, and have forgotten their ways."
"You see, dear, you have put me quite in a flutter. How do I know, for"
"instance, what you would like to have for breakfast? Your dear"
grandpapa used to have only one egg boiled for two minutes--he was
most particular--and a piece of dry toast; whereas I well remember
Mrs. Brownlow telling me that her husband used to eat a hearty meal of
"porridge and eggs and bacon, with an underdone beefsteak to follow. So"
"you see, dear, I have no rule which I could follow; you would have to"
tell me.”
"“That's quite a detail,” said John, rather touched by her unselfish,"
"if tangential, dealing with the proposal. “The main point is,” said he,"
"moving a step or two forward, “would you care to come and play propriety"
for me and this daughter of misery?”
“Do you really want me to?”
"“Naturally, since I 've asked you.”"
"She rose and came up to him. “My dear boy,” she said with wet eyes, “I"
"know I'm not a clever woman, and often when clever people like you talk,"
I don't in the least understand what they 're talking about; but I did
"love your dear mother with all my heart, and I would do anything in the"
wide world for her son.”
"John took her hand and looked down into her foolish, kind face, which"
wore for the moment the dignity of love. “I'm afraid it will mean an
"83,648. If a foreign professor would not come and serve in India for the"
"same remuneration as he obtained in his own country, the witness would"
certainly not force him to come.
"83,649. (Mr. Abdur Rahim). Recruitment for the Educational Service"
"should be made in the first place in India, if suitable men were"
available; but if not then he would allow the best outsiders to be
brought in. In the present state of the country it would be very easy to
fill up many of the chairs by selecting the best men in India.
"83,650. The aim of the universities should be to promote two classes of"
"work--first, research; and secondly, an all-round sound education. Men"
of different types would be required for these two duties.
"83,651. (Mr. Madge). Any idea that the educational system of India was"
"so far inferior to that of England, that Indians, who had made their"
"mark, had done so, not because of the educational system of the country,"
"but in spite of it, was quite unfounded. The standard of education"
prevailing in India was quite up to the mark of several British
universities. It was as true of any other country in the world as of
"India that education was valued as a means for passing examinations, and"
"not only for itself, and there was no more cramming in India than"
elsewhere.
"83,652. The West certainly brought to the East a modern spirit, which"
"was very valuable, but it would be dearly purchased by the loss of an"
honorable career for competent Indians in their own country.

"mechanical, but a turn for the better was now taking place and the"
"universities were recognising the importance of research work, and were"
(153) The patient was wounded at Paardeberg at a range of from
"500 to 700 yards. _Entry_, just to the left of the episternal"
"notch; _exit_, in the fifth left interspace posteriorly, midway"
between the spine and vertebral margin of the scapula. A
"quantity of bright blood was brought up at once, and later"
blood was coughed up in clots.
There was no great pain at the moment of the injury; the man
"again got up to the firing line, and later walked two miles to"
"the Field hospital without aid. He remained here a week, when"
"he was sent down to the Base, and during the first three days'"
journey in the wagon he began to get worse. On the fourth day
cough began to be very troublesome.
"When he arrived at the Base, fifteen days after the original"
"injury, there was much dyspnoea; the temperature was 102°,"
and the pulse 110. The left side of the chest was dull
"throughout; an aspirating needle was introduced, and a pint of"
very dark liquid blood drawn off. The whole of the blood was
not removed on account of the very severe cough and pain which
the evacuation occasioned. The man appeared to steadily improve
"until three weeks later, when the temperature, which throughout"
"had been uneven, became consistently high, and signs of fluid"
"at the base increased. An aspirating needle was introduced, and"
16 ounces of pus were drawn off. Two days later a piece of rib
was resected (Mr. Pegg) and another pint of pus evacuated.
"After this, rapid improvement took place, and in ten days the"
"man was able to be up and dressed, although a small amount of"
discharge still persisted. He eventually made an excellent
recovery.
"Secondary empyemata not uncommonly followed incision of the chest, or"
Prussia. How he had loved England in the days when he was military
"attaché there. He had once wanted to marry an Englishwoman, a Miss"
"Fraser, a so handsome daughter of a Court Physician."
"""Why, that must have been Honoria, my former partner,"" said Vivie,"
finding an intense joy in this link of memory. And she told much of
"her history to the sentimental Colonel, who was conceiving for her a"
sincere friendship and camaraderie. They opened up other veins of
"memory, talked of Lady Feenix, of the musical parties at the Parrys,"
"of Emily Daymond's playing, of this, that and the other hostess, of"
such-and-such an actress or singer.
The Colonel of course was often absent all day on military duties.
He advised Vivie strongly on such occasions not to go far from Mrs.
"Warren's little domain. ""I am obliged to remind you, dear young"
"lady, that you and your mother are my prisoners in a sense. Many bad"
things are going on--things we cannot help in war--outside this
"quiet place..."""
"In November, however, there was a change of scene, which in many"
ways came to Vivie and her mother with a sense of great relief.
Colonel von Giesselin told them one morning he had been appointed
"Secretary to the German Governor of Brussels, and must reside in the"
town not far from the Rue de la Loi. He proposed that the ladies
should move into Brussels likewise; in fact he delicately insisted
on it. Their pleasant relations could thus continue--perhaps--who
"knows?--to the end of this War, ""to that peace which will make us"
"friends once more?"" It would in any case be most unsafe if, without"
"his protection, they continued to reside at this secluded farm, on"
"the edge of the great woods. In fact it could not be thought of, and"
another officer was coming here in his place with a considerable
suite. Eventually compensation would be paid to Mrs. Warren for any
_Cock._ That shall be done anon.
"_Gammer._ Nay, tarry, Hodge, till thou hast light, and then we'll"
seek each one.
_Ralph Roister Doister_ and _Gammer Gurton's Needle_ mark the end of the
Interlude stage and the commencement of Comedy proper. Leaving the
"latter at this point for the present, we shall return in the next"
chapter to study its fortunes at the hands of Lyly.

"Morality Plays, though theoretically quite as suitable for tragic effect"
"as for comic, since the former only required that Mankind should"
"sometimes fail to reach heaven, seem nevertheless to have developed"
"mainly the lighter side, setting the hero right at the finish and in the"
"meantime discovering, to the relief of otherwise bored spectators, that"
"wickedness, in some unexplained way, was funny. As long as propriety"
forbade that good should be overcome by evil it is hard to see how
"tragedy could appear. Had Humankind, in _The Castell of Perseverance_,"
"been fought for in vain by the Virtues, or had Everyman found no"
"companion to go with him and intercede for him, there had been tragedy"
indeed. But religious optimism was against any conclusion so
"discouraging to repentance. The lingering Miracles, it is true, still"
presented the sublimest of all tragedies in the Fall of Man and the
"apparent triumph of the Pharisees over Jesus. Between them, however, and"
"the kind of drama that succeeded the Moralities, too great a gulf was"
"fixed. Contemporaries of those original spirits, Heywood and Udall,"
could hardly revert for inspiration to the discredited performances of
villages and of a few provincial towns. Tragedy had to wait until there
was matured and made popular an Interlude from which the conflict of
"Virtues and Vices, with the orthodox triumph of the former, had been"
seem that the Emperor's power is in danger rather than Luther and his
"adherents. 'If I had been present', writes Erasmus, 'I should have"
endeavoured that this tragedy would have been so tempered by moderate
arguments that it could not afterwards break out again to the still
greater detriment of the world.'
The imperial sentence was pronounced: within the Empire (as in the
Burgundian Netherlands before that time) Luther's books were to be
"burned, his adherents arrested and their goods confiscated, and Luther"
was to be given up to the authorities. Erasmus hopes that now relief
will follow. 'The Luther tragedy is at an end with us here; would it had
"never appeared on the stage.' In these days Albrecht Dürer, on hearing"
"the false news of Luther's death, wrote in the diary of his journey that"
"passionate exclamation: 'O Erasmus of Rotterdam, where will you be?"
"Hear, you knight of Christ, ride forth beside the Lord Christ, protect"
"the truth, obtain the martyr's crown. For you are but an old manikin. I"
"have heard you say that you have allowed yourself two more years, in"
"which you are still fit to do some work; spend them well, in behalf of"
"the Gospel and the true Christian faith.... O Erasmus, be on this side,"
that God may be proud of you.'
"It expresses confidence in Erasmus's power, but at bottom is the"
expectation that he will not do all this. Dürer had rightly understood
Erasmus.
"The struggle abated nowise, least of all at Louvain. Latomus, the most"
"dignified and able of Louvain divines, had now become one of the most"
"serious opponents of Luther and, in so doing, touched Erasmus, too,"
"indirectly. To Nicholas of Egmond, the Carmelite, another of Erasmus's"
"compatriots had been added as a violent antagonist, Vincent Dirks of"
"Haarlem, a Dominican. Erasmus addresses himself to the faculty, to"
"defend himself against the new attacks, and to explain why he has never"
"and may you not sell that which is your property? Are not these dogs,"
"the people, your slaves, your property? Yet you stand in cowardly fear"
of a rabble which quakes if you but crook your finger. A like fear of his
subjects cost your father his head. The people will crawl before you if
"you kick them, but let them see that you fear them, and you will learn"
"that there is no cruelty like that of the good people."""
"De Grammont, the French exile, called attention to the French king's"
"successful tyranny, declaring that his master would sell Paris if he"
chose. De Grammont was acting secretly in the French king's interest.
"A weak man easily finds logic to justify the course he desires to take,"
"so Charles turned a deaf ear to Clarendon, and, listening to Castlemain,"
"announced that Dunkirk was for sale. As expected, a strong protest came"
"from the people, but no one is so stubborn as a fool in the wrong, so"
Charles remained firm in his determination.
"Finding that protest would avail nothing, the people of London offered to"
"buy Dunkirk, and began to bid for it against the French king. Louis,"
"knowing that London was a rich city, and believing that its people would"
"run up the price of Dunkirk to an exorbitant figure, took counsel with"
himself--his only adviser--and determined to employ other means than gold
alone to obtain the coveted city.
My first definite knowledge of the French king's new plan to buy Dunkirk
"at his own price came in a letter from Hamilton, which reached me at"
Lilly's house two or three weeks after my return from Dover. Like the
"others, it was written in cipher, but, translated, was as follows:--"
DEAR FRIEND:
"""Your warning letter reached me nearly a week ago, and I thank you for"
"“She does n't want anything at all,” said the matron, and the girl's"
eyelids fluttered. “She's being spoiled too much as it is already.”
"John bent his heavy brows on the woman. She spoke not shrewishly, not"
"unkindly, merely with lack of love and understanding. He repressed the"
bitter retort that rose to his lips. But at the same time a picture rose
"before him of another sick-room, a dainty sea-chamber open to sun"
"and sky, where pillows of down were not forbidden, where flowers and"
"exquisite colours and shapes gladdened the eye, where Love, great and"
"warm and fulfilling, hovered over the bed. No gulls with round, yellow"
eyes came to the windows of this whitewashed prison with messages
"from the world of air and sea; no Exquisite Auntship, no Great High"
"Favourite, no Lord High Constable, executed their high appointed"
functions; no clock with chimes like a bell swung in a sea-cave told
the hours to this orphan child of misery. He realized in an odd way
"that Stellamaris, too, was an orphan. And he remembered, from the awful"
"evidence, that this child was just over fifteen--Stella's age."
Again rose the picture of the cherished one in her daintily ribboned
"dressing-jacket, as filmy and unsubstantial as if made of sea-foam,"
"with her pure, happy face, her mysterious, brown pools of eyes, her"
hair lovingly brushed to caressing softness; and he looked down on Unity
"Blake. Man though he was, the bit of clean sail-cloth that did duty as a"
nightgown moved his compassion.
He did his best to talk with her awhile; but it was a one-sided
"conversation, as the child could reply only in monosyllables. The matron"
"fidgeted impatiently, and he said good-bye. Her wistful glance followed"
him to the door. Outside he turned.
“There is just one thing I want to say to her.”
individual caprice be allowed to find expression as well as yours?
Probably I enjoy the hayfield as much as you do; but I enjoy quite
"other scents and sensations as well, and I take the former for granted,"
"and write my poem, for a change, about the latter. There is no"
necessary difference in artistic value between a good poem about a
flower in the hedge and a good poem about the scent in a sachet. I am
always charmed to read beautiful poems about nature in the country.
"Only, personally, I prefer town to country; and in the town we have to"
"find for ourselves, as best we may, the _décor_ which is the town"
equivalent of the great natural _décor_ of fields and hills. Here it is
that artificiality comes in; and if any one sees no beauty in the
"effects of artificial light, in all the variable, most human, and yet"
"most factitious town landscape, I can only pity him, and go on my own"
way.
"That is, if he will let me. But he tells me that one thing is right and"
the other is wrong; that one is good art and the other is bad; and I
"listen in amazement, sometimes not without impatience, wondering why an"
"estimable personal prejudice should be thus exalted into a dogma, and"
"uttered in the name of art. For in art there can be no prejudices, only"
"results. If we arc to save people’s souls by the writing of verses,"
"well and good. But if not, there is no choice but to admit an absolute"
"freedom of choice. And if Patchouli pleases one, why not Patchouli?"

"London, _February,_1896."
pretending that there is none within the palace. As if a Queen of Spain
"could not have all the milk she wanted! Ridiculous!"""
By this time the little girl had mounted the parapet and was clinging
"with all her might to the iron railings, while a fat motherly person had"
"waddled out of the underbrush in search of her, and with many"
exclamations of pretended anger and indignation was endeavouring to
entice her away.
"But the more the nurse scolded and pulled, the more firmly did the"
"little maid cling to the golden bars. At last the elderly woman, quite"
"out of breath, sat down on the stone ledge and addressed to her charge"
the argument which in such cases betokens unconditional surrender.
"""My lady Isabel, what would your noble and royal mother say,"" she"
"gasped, ""thus to forget all the counsels and commands of those put in"
authority over you and run to the railings to chatter with a gipsy wife?
"Go away, goatherdess, or I will call the attendants and have you put in"
"prison!"""
"La Giralda had stopped her flock, obedient to the wishes of the little"
"maid, but now, with a low curtsey to both, she gathered them together"
"with her peculiar whistling cry, and prepared to continue her way down"
into the village.
But this the little girl would in nowise permit. She let go the iron
"rail, and with both hands clenched fell upon her attendant with"
concentrated fury.
"""Bad, wicked Susana,"" she cried, ""I will have you whipped and sent about"
"your business. Nay, I myself will beat you. I will kill you, do you"
hear? I have had nothing to eat and no one to play with for a week--not
"sullen. He looked frowningly at me, and I watched him equally"
"frowningly, and took him for a thinker, an Ibsenite whose imagination"
was lost among the ice of his own country. Now and then I would see
"him walking up and down the corridor, rubbing his hands together so"
continuously and so frantically that they made a noise like bones.
"“Suddenly, this gentleman is transformed as if by magic; he begins to"
"joke with the servants, he seizes a chair and dances with it, and the"
other day I saw him alone in the salon marching around with a paper hat
"on his head, like children playing soldiers, and blowing on a cornet,"
"also made of paper.” I stared at him in amazement, he smiled like a"
"child, and asked if he was disturbing me."
"“‘No, no, not in the least,’ I told him."
"“I have asked in the hotel if this man is crazy, and they have told me"
"that he is not, but is a professor, a man of science, who is known to"
have these strange fits of gaiety.
"“Another of the Norwegian’s doings has been to compose a serenade, with"
"a vulgar melody that would disgust you, and which he has dedicated ‘_A"
"la bella Italia_.’ He wrote the Italian words himself, but as he knows"
"no music, he had a pianist come here and write out his serenade. What"
he especially wants is that it should be full of sentiment; and so the
"pianist arranged it with directions and many pauses, which satisfied"
the Norwegian. Almost every night the serenade ‘_A la bella Italia_’
"is sung. Somebody who wants to amuse himself goes to the piano, the"
Norwegian strikes a languid attitude and chants his serenade. Sometimes
"he goes in front of the piano, sometimes behind, but invariably he hears"
"the storm of applause when it ends, and he bows with great gusto."
"“I don’t know whether it’s the other people who are laughing at him, or"
the signal.
But in the increasing noise of the battle his voice already sounded less
"powerfully than before. A letter to Cardinal Albert of Mayence, 19"
"October 1519, of about the same content as that of Frederick of Saxony"
"written in the preceding spring, was at once circulated by Luther's"
"friends; and by the advocates of conservatism, in spite of the usual"
"protestation, 'I do not know Luther', it was made to serve against"
Erasmus.
It became more and more clear that the mediating and conciliatory
position which Erasmus wished to take up would soon be altogether
"untenable. The inquisitor Jacob Hoogstraten had come from Cologne, where"
"he was a member of the University, to Louvain, to work against Luther"
"there, as he had worked against Reuchlin. On 7 November 1519 the Louvain"
"faculty, following the example of that of Cologne, proceeded to take the"
decisive step: the solemn condemnation of a number of Luther's opinions.
"In future no place could be less suitable to Erasmus than Louvain, the"
citadel of action against reformers. It is surprising that he remained
there another two years.
The expectation that he would be able to speak the conciliating word was
paling. For the rest he failed to see the true proportions. During the
first months of 1520 his attention was almost entirely taken up by his
"own polemics with Lee, a paltry incident in the great revolution. The"
desire to keep aloof got more and more the upper hand of him. In June he
writes to Melanchthon: 'I see that matters begin to look like sedition.
"It is perhaps necessary that scandals occur, but I should prefer not to"
"be the author.' He has, he thinks, by his influence with Wolsey,"
"prevented the burning of Luther's writings in England, which had been"
"ordered. But he was mistaken. The burning had taken place in London, as"
early as 12 May.
mother had better pursue: leave Tervueren and seek a lodging in
Brussels; or retreat as far as Ghent or Bruges or even Holland? The
clerk reassured her. The Germans had certainly occupied the
"south-east of Belgium, but dared not push as far to the west and"
north as Brussels. They risked otherwise being nipped between the
Belgian army of Antwerp and the British force marching on Mons....
He directed her attention to the last _communiqué_ of the Ministry
"of War: ""La situation n'a jamais été meilleure. Bruxelles, à l'abri"
"d'un coup de main, est défendue par vingt mille gardes civiques"
"armés d'un excellent fusil,"" etc."
Vivie returned therefore a trifle reassured. At the same time she
and her mother spent some hours in packing up and posting valuable
"securities to London, via Ostende, in packing for deposit in the"
strong rooms of a Brussels bank Mrs. Warren's jewellery and plate.
The tram service from Tervueren had ceased to run. So they induced a
neighbour to drive them into Brussels in a chaise: a slow and
wearisome journey under a broiling sun. Arrived in Brussels they
found the town in consternation. Placarded on the walls was a notice
signed by the Burgomaster--the celebrated Adolphe Max--informing the
Bruxellois that in spite of the resistances of the Belgian army it
was to be feared the enemy might soon be in occupation of Brussels.
"In such an event he adjured the citizens to avoid all panic, to give"
"no legitimate cause of offence to the Germans, to renounce any idea"
of resorting to arms! The Germans on their part were bound
"by the laws of war to respect private property, the lives of"
"non-combatants, the honour of women, and the exercise of religion."
Vivie and her mother found the banks closed and likewise the railway
station. They now had but one thought: to get back as quickly as
"possible to Villa Beau-séjour, and fortunately for their dry-mouthed"
impatience their farmer friend was of the same mind. Along the
"drift into Self and Wrong, than to strike out brave arms, and swim,"
"despite all difficulty, toward God and Right, yet if we once take the"
"latter course, we shall find it the most natural and the least"
fatiguing. And with every separate stroke of high endeavor we carry
"others with us,--we raise our race,--we bear it onward,--upward! And"
"the true reward, or best result of fame, is, that having succeeded in"
"winning brief attention from the multitude, a man may be able to"
pronounce one of God's lightning messages of inspired Truth plainly to
"them, while they are yet willing to stand and listen. This momentary"
"hearing from the people is, as I take it, the sole reward any writer"
"can dare to hope for,--and when he obtains it, he should remember that"
"his audience remains with him but a very short while,--so that it is"
"his duty to see that he employ his chance WELL, not to win applause for"
"himself, but to cheer and lift others to noble thought, and still more"
"noble fulfilment."""
Villiers regarded him wistfully.
"""Alwyn, my dear fellow, do you want to be the Sisyphus of this"
"era?--You will find the stone of Evil heavy to roll upward,--moreover,"
it will exhibit the usually painful tendency to slip back and crush
"you!"""
"""How can it crush me?"" asked his friend with a serene smile. ""My heart"
"cannot be broken, or my spirit dismayed, and as for my body, it can but"
"die,--and death comes to every man! I would rather try to roll up the"
"stone, however fruitless the task, than sit idly looking at it, and"
"doing nothing!"""
"""Your heart cannot be broken? Ah! how do you know"" ... and Villiers"
"shook his head dubiously--""What man can be certain of his own destiny?"""
"Louvain objected, 'if you do not really approve of any of them?' And"
"Erasmus answers with Horace's word: 'In the first place, because I"
cannot sleep'.
"A sleepless energy, it was that indeed. He cannot rest. Still half"
"seasick and occupied with his trunks, he is already thinking about an"
"answer to Dorp's letter, just received, censuring the _Moria_. We should"
"fully realize what it means that time after time Erasmus, who, by"
"nature, loved quiet and was fearful, and fond of comfort, cleanliness"
"and good fare, undertakes troublesome and dangerous journeys, even"
"voyages, which he detests, for the sake of his work and of that alone."
"He is not only restless, but also precipitate. Helped by an incomparably"
retentive and capacious memory he writes at haphazard. He never becomes
anacoluthic; his talent is too refined and sure for that; but he does
repeat himself and is unnecessarily circumstantial. 'I rather pour out
"than write everything,' he says. He compares his publications to"
"parturitions, nay, to abortions. He does not select his subjects, he"
"tumbles into them, and having once taken up a subject he finishes"
"without intermission. For years he has read only _tumultuarie_, up and"
down all literature; he no longer finds time really to refresh his mind
"by reading, and to work so as to please himself. On that account he"
envied Budaeus.
"'Do not publish too hastily,' More warns him: 'you are watched to be"
"caught in inexactitudes.' Erasmus knows it: he will correct all later,"
he will ever have to revise and to polish everything. He hates the
"labour of revising and correcting, but he submits to it, and works"
"passionately, 'in the treadmill of Basle', and, he says, finishes the"
work of six years in eight months.
In that recklessness and precipitation with which Erasmus labours there
"Brand had been to Jupiter on four different trips; and, as he walked"
"toward his quarters from Stone's office, he reviewed what he had"
learned on those trips.
"Jupiter, as he knew it, was a vast globe of vague horror and sharp"
contrasts.
"Distant from the sun as it was, it received little solar heat. But,"
"with so great a mass, it had cooled off much more slowly than any of"
"the other planets known, and had immense internal heat. This meant"
that the air--which closely approximated Earth's air in density--was
"cool a few hundred yards up from the surface of the planet, and dankly"
"hot close to the ground. The result, as the cold air constantly sank"
"into the warm, was a thick steamy blanket of fog that covered"
everything perpetually.
"Because of the recent cooling, life was not far advanced on Jupiter."
Too short a time ago the sphere had been but a blazing mass. Tropical
"marshes prevailed, crisscrossed by mighty rivers at warmer than blood"
"heat. Giant, hideous fernlike growths crowded one another in an"
"everlasting jungle. And among the distorted trees, from the blanket of"
"soft white fog that hid all from sight, could be heard constantly an"
ear-splitting chorus of screams and bellows and whistling snarls. It
made the blood run cold just to listen--and to speculate on what
gigantic but tiny-brained monsters made them.
"Now and then, when Brand had been flying dangerously low over the"
"surface, a wind had risen strong enough to dispel the fog banks for an"
"instant; and he had caught a flash of Jovian life. Just a flash, for"
"example, of a monstrous lizard-like thing too great to support its own"
"bulk: or a creature all neck and tail, with ridges of scale on its"
"The Girl smiled at the emphasis on the last word, for she knew that it"
"referred to her. Furthermore, she had divined pretty well what had been"
"his thoughts concerning his old life; but, being essentially a woman of"
"action and not words, she said nothing."
A moment or so later he asked her to read to him. The Girl looked as she
might have looked if he had asked her to go to the moon.
"Notwithstanding, she got up and, presently, returned with a lot of old"
"school-books, which she solemnly handed over for his inspection."
The invalid smiled at the look of earnestness on the Girl's face.
"""Not these?"" he gently inquired. ""Where is the Dante you were telling me"
"about?"""
Once more the Girl went over to the book-shelf; when she came back she
"handed him a volume, which he glanced over carefully before showing her"
the place where he wished her to begin to read to him.
At first the Girl was embarrassed and stumbled badly. But on seeing that
he seemed not to notice it she gained courage and acquitted herself
"creditably, at least, so she flattered herself, for she could detect, as"
"she looked up from time to time, no expression other than pleasure on"
"his face. It may be surmised, though, that Johnson had not merely chosen"
"a page at random; on the contrary, when the book was in his hand he had"
"quickly found the lines which the Girl had, so to say, paraphrased, and"
"he was intensely curious to see how they would appeal to her. But now,"
"apparently, she saw nothing in the least amusing in them, nor in other"
"passages fully as sentimental. In fact, no comment of any kind was"
"forthcoming from her--though Johnson was looking for it and, to tell the"
"truth, was somewhat disappointed--when she read that Dante had probably"
never spoken more than twice to Beatrice and his passion had no other
"fully what were the Girl's feelings, did not dare to whisper even a word"
"of encouragement to her. At last, she ordered the Indian to lead the"
"way, and they started."
"The trail curved and twisted around the mountain, and in places they had"
to use the greatest care lest a misstep should carry them over a
"precipice with a drop of hundreds of feet. It was a perilous descent,"
"inasmuch as the path was covered with snow. Moreover, it was necessary"
that as little noise as possible should be made while they were making
"their way past the buildings of the camp below, for the Mexican had not"
"been wrong when he stated that Ashby's men were quartered at, or in the"
"immediate vicinity of, The Palmetto. Fortunately, they passed through"
"without meeting anyone, and before long they came to the edge of the"
plateau beneath which was the ravine which Johnson had to cross to reach
the spot where it had been agreed that Castro should be waiting with
horses for his master. It was also the place where the Girl was to leave
"her lover to go on alone, and so they halted. A few moments passed"
"without either of them speaking; at length, the man said in as cheery a"
voice as he could summon:
"""I must leave you here. I remember the way well. All danger is past."""
The Girl's lips were quivering; she asked:
"""An' when will you be back?"""
"The man noted her emotion, and though he himself was conscious of a"
choking sensation he contrived to say in a most optimistic tone:
"""In two weeks--not more than two weeks. It will take all that time to"
"arrange things at the rancho. As it is, I hardly see my way clear to"
"dismissing my men--you see, they belong to me, almost, and--but I'll do"
time comes--after I've done my part.
"""I'm only sorry I haven't been able to get rid of Captain Dove right"
"away, but it won't be long now till--You needn't worry any more about"
him. I'll see that he behaves better.
"""If there's anything else I can do for your comfort, you must let me"
"know. And now, I'll leave you to your own devices until it's time to"
"start on our travels. Better get a rest while you can, eh? We've a very"
"busy week ahead of us."""
"She saw that he did not intend to tell her any more in the meantime, and"
"was glad to see him go. Then she called Ambrizette in for company, and"
"sat down by the window again, to try to sort out for herself the"
bewildering tangle that life had once more become within a few hours.
"Gazing out across the familiar sea with wistful, far-away eyes, she"
mused for a time over what Captain Dove had told Mr. Jobling of her
"history, and strove to piece together with that all she herself could"
recall of that dim and always more mysterious past out of which she had
"come to be Captain Dove's property, bought and paid for, at a high"
"price, as he had repeated several times."
"Her own earliest vague, disconnected, ineffectual memories were all of"
"some dark, savage mountain-country; of endless days of travel; of"
"camp-fires in the cold, and hungry camels squealing for fodder; of the"
fragrant cinnamon-smell of the steam that came from the cooking-pots.
"Before, or, it might have been, after that, she had surely lived on some"
"seashore, in a shimmering white village with narrow, crooked lanes for"
streets and little flat-roofed houses huddled together among hot
sandhills where the _suddra_ grew and lean goats bleated always for
distended that little white beads were forcing themselves from the
"teats, and they expressed their desire for relief by plaintive"
whimperings and by laying their rough heads caressingly against La
Giralda's short and primitive skirt and leather-cased legs.
In a few moments after they had reached the pavilion the Princess came
"shouting back. She was certainly a most jovial little person, Spanish at"
"all points, with great dark eyes and cheeks apple-red with good health"
and the sharp airs of the Guadarrama. Doña Susana had walked a little in
"front of La Giralda and her flock, to show the superiority of her"
"position, and also, it may be, to display the amplitude of her several"
"chins, by holding them in the air in a manner as becoming as it was"
dignified.
"""Milk them! Milk them quickly! Let me see!"" the Princess shouted,"
clanging the pails joyously together. The walls of the pavilion in which
La Giralda found herself were decorated with every kind of household
"utensil, but not such as had ever been used practically. Everything was"
of silver or silver-gilt. There was indeed a complete _batterie de
"cuisine_--saucepans, patty-pans, graters, a mincing machine with the"
"proper screws and handles, shining rows of lids, and a complete"
graduated series of cooking spoons stuck in a bandolier. Salad dishes of
"sparkling crystal bound with silver ornamented the sideboard, while"
various earthen pots and pans of humbler make stood on a curiously
designed stove under whose polished top no fire had ever burned. At
"least so it appeared to La Giralda, who, much impressed by the"
"magnificence of the installation, would promptly have driven her goats"
out again.
But this the little Isabel would by no means permit.
"""Here--here!"" she commanded, ""this is mine--my very own. My mother has a"
It may be added that neither in the one Lagoon nor in the other are
"there any private, proprietary rights to coral outcrops. The whole"
"community of Sinaketa have their fishing grounds in the Lagoon,"
"within which every man may hunt for his spondylus shell, and catch"
"his fish at times. If the other spondylus fishing community, the"
"Vakutans, encroached upon their grounds, there would be trouble,"
"and in olden days, fighting. Private ownership in coral outcrops"
"exists in the Northern villages of the Lagoon, that is in Kavataria,"
and the villages on the island of Kayleula.

We must now follow the later stages of the kaloma industry. The
technology of the proceedings is so mixed up with remarkable
sociological and economic arrangements that it will be better to
indicate it first in its main outlines. The spondylus consists of a
"shell, the size and shape of a hollowed out half of a pear, and of a"
"flat, small lid. It is only the first part which is worked. First"
it has to be broken into pieces with a binabina or an utukema
(green stone imported from Woodlark Island) as shown on Plate L
"(A). On each piece, then, can be seen the stratification of the"
"shell: the outside layer of soft, chalky substance; under this, the"
"layer of red, hard, calcareous material, and then the inmost, white,"
crystalline stratum. Both the outside and inside have to be rubbed
"off, but first each piece has to be roughly rounded up, so as to form"
"a thick circular lump. Such a lump (see foregrounds of Plates L (A),"
L (B)) is then put in the hole of a cylindrical piece of wood. This
latter serves as a handle with which the lumps are rubbed on a piece
of flat sandstone (see Plate L (B)). The rubbing is carried on so far
controlled himself for a whole week then there was a touching farewell
"scene between the two friends, which ended as a rule in the"
"eating-house of Vaviloff.  The teacher did not spend all his money, but"
spent at least half on the children of the main street.  The poor are
"always rich in children, and in the dirt and ditches of this street"
"there were groups of them from morning to night, hungry, naked and"
"dirty.  Children are the living flowers of the earth, but these had the"
"appearance of flowers that have faded prematurely, because they grew in"
ground where there was no healthy nourishment.  Often the teacher would
"gather them round him, would buy them bread, eggs, apples and nuts, and"
take them into the fields by the river side.  There they would sit and
"greedily eat everything he offered them, after which they would begin"
"to play, filling the fields for a mile around with careless noise and"
"laughter.  The tall, thin figure of the drunkard towered above these"
"small people, who treated him familiarly, as if he were one of their"
"own age.  They called him ""Philip,"" and did not trouble to prefix"
"""Uncle"" to his name. Playing around him, like little wild animals, they"
"pushed him, jumped upon his back, beat him upon his bald head, and"
"caught hold of his nose. All this must have pleased him, as he did not"
"protest against such liberties.  He spoke very little to them, and when"
he did so he did it cautiously as if afraid that his words would hurt
or contaminate them.  He passed many hours thus as their companion and
"plaything, watching their lively faces with his gloomy eyes.  Then he"
would thoughtfully and slowly direct his steps to the eatinghouse of
"Vaviloff, where he would drink silently and quickly till all his senses"
left him.

"Almost every day after his reporting he would bring a newspaper, and"
then gather round him all these creatures that once were men.
He was near singing more than once. The place was astir with the sound
"of Betty’s skirts, the echo of her gaiety, the sound of her light"
footstep. The air was sweet with the breath of her uncomplaining
good-nature.
"He shut up the bag, tied a label upon it, put on his cloak and hat,"
"blew out the candle, and softly let himself out of the room."
In the darkness Noll stood upon the bridge at the end of the Boule
"Miche, the pleasant highway of youth. But he now knew no indecisions."
He realized that his mere intellect had led him into the veriest
pedantries--had nearly led him into irretrievable blunders. He saw that
"man’s highest was rooted in the body, that heaven was no fantastic"
"dream, but here and now for the winning on this healthy brown earth."
"He had been letting it slip by him, whilst he dreamed of pasteboard"
nothingnesses.
He realized that the emotion felt was nearer to the centre of life than
"all thought. He cast from him the devil of mere intellect, and it went"
"out of him demurely into the darkness, like some poor thin-souled nun,"
who crushes down into barrenness the splendid emotions of the life
"within her which are her very godhood, in fantastic hope to win an"
"eternity of vague bliss, she who by the very act shows her inability"
"to enjoy bliss--for, heaven and hell and all the eternities shall"
yield her no such bliss as the dear human loves may do--the æons of
immortality shall never bring her the delight that she might know in an
hour of a lover’s embrace or the dear touch of a nestling child at her
lean breasts.
"As the awakened youth stood there, the black night passed over the edge"
"_Wounds of the omentum._--Here, again, I am unable to express any"
"opinion, although the supposition that hæmorrhage from this source took"
place is natural.
"Prolapse of omentum was comparatively rare, except in cases with large"
wounds; it was apparently seen with some frequency among patients who
"died rapidly on the field of battle. I only saw it twice, and on each"
occasion in shell wounds. The wounds from small-calibre bullets were as
a rule too small to allow of external prolapse.
"Fig. 89, however, illustrates a very interesting observation. A patient"
"in the German Ambulance in Heilbron, under Dr. Flockemann, died as a"
result of suppuration and hæmorrhage secondary to an injury to the
colon. At the autopsy a portion of the omentum was found adherent in the
"wound of exit, but it had not reached the external surface. The chief"
interest of the observation lies in the light it throws on the mechanism
of these injuries. It is impossible to conceive that a small-calibre
bullet coming into direct contact with the omentum could do anything but
"perforate it. It, therefore, appears clear that in a displacement like"
"that figured, only lateral impact occurred with the omentum, which was"
"carried along by the spin and rush of the bullet into the canal of exit,"
where it lodged.
[Illustration: FIG. 89.--Great Omentum carried by the bullet into an
exit track leading from the abdominal cavity. A. Outline of opening in

_Results of injury to the intestine._ 1. _Escape of contents and

be said on this subject. The escape of contents into the peritoneal

"The ledge was narrow, and as the bunch clung together where the leader"
"and his opponent still struggled, one of them slipped over the edge of"
the declivity and started downward. Naturally he caught hold of the
"first object within his reach, and this happened to be the shoe of the"
"outlaw nearest to him. This man, in turn, caught another, and two more"
"tried to pull up the falling ones, with the result that in about half a"
minute five of the half-breeds were rolling and tumbling heels over head
down the rocky slope.
"The boys were not far out of their path, but they managed to elude the"
downrushing bodies as they swung by. Notwithstanding the gravity of the
"situation, the boys shrieked with laughter as the clumsy fellows went"
"tumbling down, uttering vicious curses at the boys, at the mountain and"
at each other.
“I wish I had a gun now!” shouted Frank.
As he spoke a formidable weapon which seemed to be half revolver and
"half sawed-off shotgun, flew out of the hands of one of the involuntary"
acrobats and landed against Frank’s side with a great thud.
Frank seized the weapon and backed away. By this time the leader was on
his feet shouting wrathful commands for the boys to return.
"“Easy, now,” Frank shouted, moving away to the south. “If any of you"
"ginks lift a finger until we get into the timber line, I’ll empty this"
load of slugs into the thick of you.”
"The leader, more daring than the others, sprang down the slope, his"
great boots scattering fragments of rock and sending them hurtling down
upon the heads of the half-breeds below. Frank was about to fire when
the man lost his balance and joined the procession of those making for
The change in the aspect of affairs would have made a greater difference
to most companies of adventurers than it did to that of which Master
Rollo Blair of Blair Castle in the shire of Fife was the leader. In the
morning they had all risen with the expectation of being shot with the
sun-rising. At ten of the clock they were speeding southward on good
"horses, holding acknowledged rank and position in the army of the only"
Catholic and religious sovereign.
But they were a philosophic quartette. Rollo drew in the morning air and
blew it back again through his nostrils without thinking much of how
nearly he had come to kissing the brown earth of Luis Fernandez's garden
with a dozen bullets through his heart. Mortimer meditated somewhat
"sulkily upon his lost onions, rustling pleasantly back there in the cool"
_patio_ of the nunnery. Etienne sorrowed for his latest love idyll
"ruthlessly cut short, and as to El Sarria, he thought of nothing save"
that Dolóres had come back to him and that he had yet to reckon with the
Fernandez family. The next time he would attend to the whole matter
"himself, and there would be no mistakes."
It was not without sadness that Rollo looked his last on the white
walls of the convent of the Holy Innocents. He was glad indeed to have
"placed Dolóres in safety--glad that she and her child were together, and"
that the good sisters were responsible for them. Between them the four
"had made up a purse to be sent by Concha to the Mother Superior, to be"
"applied for the behoof of her guests till the better days should come,"
and Ramon Garcia be able to claim his wife and first-born son.
But Concha had refused point-blank.
"""The babe came through the wicket. The mother arrived by night, a"
"fugitive asking pity, like the Virgin fleeing down to Egypt in the"
"pictures,"" said Concha. ""The convent needs no alms, nor does the Lady"
He assisted her to carry the inert old woman across the street and a
"short distance along the opposite pavement. Here, there was a"
"pleasant, modest-looking tea-shop with the name of Walcker over the"
"front, and embedded in the plate glass were the words ""Tea Rooms."""
"These of course dated from long before the war, when the best"
Chinese tea was only four francs the demi-kilo and the fashion for
afternoon tea had become established in Brussels. Vivie and her
mother had often entered Walcker's shop in happier days for a cup of
"tea and delicious forms of home-made pastry. Besides the cakes,"
"which in pre-war times were of an excellence rarely equalled, they"
had been drawn to the pleasant-looking serving woman. She was so
"English in appearance, though she only spoke French and Flemish."
Behind the shop was a cosy little room where the more intimate
clients were served with tea; a room with a look-out into a little
square of garden. Thither Mrs. Warren was carried or supported. She
"regained consciousness slightly as she was placed on a chair,"
"opened her eyes, and said ""Thank you, my dears."" Then her head fell"
over to one side and she was dead--seemingly....
The _agent de police_ went away to fetch a doctor and to disperse
the crowd of _ketjes_[1] and loafers which had transferred itself
"from the hotel to the tea-shop. The shop woman, who was one of those"
angels of kindness that turn up unexpectedly in the paths of unhappy
"people, called in a stout serving wench from the kitchen, and the"
three of them carried Mrs. Warren out of the inner tea-room into the
"back premises and a spare bedroom. Here she was laid on the bed,"
partially undressed and all available and likely restoratives
applied.
[Footnote 1: Street urchins of Brussels. How they harassed the
Germans and maddened them by mimicking their military manoeuvres!]
one comes to fill the place.” And she went to her desk at once and hung
the black turban hat with the gold-green macaw wing in its accustomed
place.
He who has been denied the spectacle of a busy Manhattan broker during
a rush of business is handicapped for the profession of anthropology.
The poet sings of the “crowded hour of glorious life.” The broker’s
"hour is not only crowded, but the minutes and seconds are hanging to"
all the straps and packing both front and rear platforms.
And this day was Harvey Maxwell’s busy day. The ticker began to reel
"out jerkily its fitful coils of tape, the desk telephone had a chronic"
attack of buzzing. Men began to throng into the office and call at him
"over the railing, jovially, sharply, viciously, excitedly. Messenger"
boys ran in and out with messages and telegrams. The clerks in the
office jumped about like sailors during a storm. Even Pitcher’s face
relaxed into something resembling animation.
On the Exchange there were hurricanes and landslides and snowstorms and
"glaciers and volcanoes, and those elemental disturbances were"
reproduced in miniature in the broker’s offices. Maxwell shoved his
chair against the wall and transacted business after the manner of a
"toe dancer. He jumped from ticker to ’phone, from desk to door with the"
trained agility of a harlequin.
In the midst of this growing and important stress the broker became
suddenly aware of a high-rolled fringe of golden hair under a nodding
"canopy of velvet and ostrich tips, an imitation sealskin sacque and a"
"string of beads as large as hickory nuts, ending near the floor with a"
silver heart. There was a self-possessed young lady connected with
these accessories; and Pitcher was there to construe her.
"wildly, a bell in terror. Yellow gleams streaked the fretted waters,"
"and again the trumpet challenged the dark walls, like the cry of a"
sea-bird driven by the storm.
The duke and Francesco looked meaningly at each other. The sound
needed no words to christen it; they knew that the Pisans had
"attacked. They heard the roar and the cries from the rampart, the"
cataractine thunder of a distant battle.
"Pushing on more swiftly as the woods thinned, the din grew more"
"definite, more human, more sinister in detail. It stirred the blood,"
"challenged the courage, racked conjecture with the infinite chaos it"
portended. Victory and despair were trammelled up together in its
sullen roar; life and death seemed to swell it with the wind sound of
"their wings. It was stupendous, chaotic, a tempest cry of steel and"
passions inflamed.
The duke's face kindled to the sound as he shouted to his men to
"gallop on. Yet another furlong, and the spectral trunks dwindled, the"
"sombre boughs seemed to mingle with the clouds, while gray, indefinite"
"before them, engulfing the lightnings of heaven, loomed the great"
"swell of the Tyrrhene, dark and restless under the thunderclouds, that"
came nearer and nearer. Ghostly the plains of Torre del Greco
"stretched towards the Promontory of Circé, and, solitary and"
"impregnable, the Castello of Astura rose upon its chalk-cliffs, white"
in the lightnings which hissed around its summit.
"The duke's men had come up, forming a wide semicircle around the"
"leaders. At their feet opened a deep ravine, leading into the plain;"
"half a furlong beyond, although it seemed less than a lance's throw"
"across, rose the castle of the Frangipani, washed by the waves of the"
"Tyrrhene. The Pisans had attacked the southern acclivity, and the"
"had not seen the half. The city, all roofs and spires and bridges,"
"girt with a wall of seventy towers, roared beneath us; and that I had"
expected. But outside the wall I now saw a second city of huts and
"tents, with a great earthwork about it, and bastions and demilunes and"
picquets posted.
This was the Swedish Lager. It lay principally to the south of the
"city proper, though on all sides it encircled it more or less. They"
told me that there lay in it about forty thousand soldiers and twenty
"thousand horses, and twenty thousand camp followers; but the number"
"was constantly increasing, death and disease notwithstanding, so that"
it presently stood as high as sixty thousand fighting men and half as
"many followers, to say nothing of the garrison that lay in the city,"
"or the troops posted to guard the approaches. It seemed to me, gazing"
"over that mighty multitude from the top of the hill, that nothing"
could resist such a force; and I looked abroad with curiosity for the
enemy.
I expected to view his army cheek by jowl with us; and I was
"disappointed when I saw beyond our camp to southward, where I was told"
"he lay, only a clear plain with the little river Rednitz flowing"
"through it. This plain was a league and more in width, and it was"
"empty of men. Beyond it rose a black wooded ridge, very steep and"
hairy.
My lady explained that Wallenstein's army lay along this
"ridge--seventy thousand men, and forty thousand horses, and"
"Wallenstein himself. His camp we heard was eight miles round, the"
"front guarded by a line of cannon, and taking in whole villages and"
castles. And now I looked again I saw the smoke hang among the trees.
They whispered in Nuremberg that no man in that army took pay; that
all served for booty; and that the troopers that sacked Magdeburg and
"At all events, the Sergeant and La Giralda went off calmly enough in the"
"direction of the town of San Ildefonso, driving their donkey before"
"them. For a minute, as they gained the crest, their figures stood out"
black and clear against the coppery sunrise. The next they had
"disappeared down the slope, the flapping peak of Cardono's Montera cap"
being the last thing to be lost sight of.
"The long, dragging, idle day was before the party in the dry ravine."
"Etienne went to his saddle-bags, and drawing his breviary from the"
"leathern flap, began to peruse the lessons for the day with an attentive"
piety which was not lessened by the fact that he had forgotten most of
"the Latin he had learned at school. John Mortimer, on the other hand,"
"took out his pocket-book, and was soon absorbed by calculations in which"
wine and onions shared the page with schemes for importing into Spain
Manchester goods woven and dyed to suit the taste of the country
housewives.
El Sarria sat down with a long sigh to his never-failing resort of
"cleaning and ordering his rifle and pistols. He had a phial of oil, a"
"feather, and a fine linen rag which he carried about with him for the"
purpose. Afterwards he undertook the same office for the weapons of
Rollo. Those of the other members of the expedition might take care of
themselves. Ramon Garcia had small belief in their ability to make much
"use of them, at any rate--the sergeant being alone excepted."
"These three being accounted for, there remained only Rollo and Concha."
"Now there was a double shelf a little way from the horses, from which"
the chief of the expedition could keep an eye on the whole encampment.
"The pair slowly and, as it were, unconsciously gravitated thither, and"
"in a moment Rollo found himself telling ""the story of his life"" to a"
Edward refuses hot bread at breakfast. His hostess asks whether he
"likes it. “Yes, I am extremely fond of it.” “Why did you refuse it?”"
“Because I know that my papa does not approve of my eating it. Am I to
"disobey a Father and Mother I love so well, and forget my duty, because"
"they are a long way off? I would not touch the cake, were I sure nobody"
"could see me. I myself should know it, and that would be sufficient.”"
"“Nobly replied!” exclaimed Mrs. C. “Act always thus, and you must be"
"happy, for although the whole world should refuse the praise that is"
"due, you must enjoy the approbation of your conscience, which is beyond"
anything else.”
Here is a quotation of the same kind from Mrs. Sherwood:
"“Tender-souled little creatures, desolated by a sense of sin, if"
they did but eat a spoonful of cupboard jam without Mamma's express
"permission.... Would a modern Lucy, jealous of her sister Emily's doll,"
break out thus easily into tearful apology for her guilt?--‘I know
"it is wicked in me to be sorry that Emily is happy, but I feel that"
I cannot help it.’ And would a modern mother retort with heartfelt
"joy?--'My dear child, I am glad you have confessed. Now I shall tell"
you why you feel this wicked sorrow'--proceeding to an account of the
depravity of human nature so unredeemed by comfort for a childish mind
of common intelligence that one can scarcely imagine the interview
ending in anything less tragic than a fit of juvenile hysteria.”
Description of a Good Boy. “A good boy is dutiful to his Father and
"Mother, obedient to his master and loving to his playfellows. He is"

"the morning, makes himself clean and decent, and says his prayers."
"He loves to hear good advice, is thankful to those who give it and"
Sidney literally blinked before the picture Pola drew--blinked and
blushed that she had dared angle for Mr. Dugald herself like the
forty-to-fourteen single ladies. Mr. Dugald belonged to a world that
"was foreign to the Romley girls, Pola's dazzling, peacock-world."
Sidney felt immensely flattered that Pola had taken her in among her
"peacocks. (Secretly, too, she considered that she carried herself well"
"among them. She was most careful of her dress, now!) She did not know"
"that Pola's sort instinctively seeks out someone to dazzle, that Pola's"
generosity was a part of the dazzling process. She thought Pola
"wonderful to accept so casually her gilded privileges. Why, if Pola"
didn't like a dress or a hat or a pair of shoes she simply didn't wear
it; she could buy anything she wanted from any one of the priceless
bits of jewelry in the shops at Hyannis to the delectable sweets in the
tea-rooms on Commercial Street. She could do just as she pleased--even
"more than Mart, for _she_ never had to darn or mend or wipe dishes or"
dust or hang up her clothes or brush them. Realizing all this Sidney
came to forgive that first condescension that had stung; she thought
Pola little short of an angel to be so prettily friendly with them all.
So engrossed was Sidney in basking in Pola's favor that for a time she
felt no compunctions at deserting Mart and Lavender; in fact she did
not even think of them. Both Mart and Lavender had become suddenly very
"busy with affairs that kept them out of sight. If, once in awhile,"
Sidney wondered what they were doing something of Pola's or something
Pola said quickly crowded the thought from her head. But one afternoon
they encountered Mart as they strolled toward the Green Lantern to sit
under its gay awnings and drink tea. Sidney introduced Mart to Pola and
"to cover Pola's rude stare she added quickly: ""We're going down to the"
"Green Lantern, Mart. Won't you come with us?"" conscious as she said it"
that her voice sounded stilted.
Mr. Watson Cheyne[19] published a very remarkable instance of one of the
"dangers of an injury from a spent bullet, in which, in spite of"
"non-penetration of the abdominal cavity, the small intestine was"
ruptured in two places.
I believe the majority of the wounds designated as explosive were the
"result of the passage of large leaden bullets, either of the"
Martini-Henry or Express type. The small opportunity of observing such
injuries in the hospitals of course depended on the fact that the
majority were rapidly fatal.
_Nature of the anatomical lesion in wounds of the intestine._--The
openings in the parietal peritoneum tended to assume the slit or star
"forms, probably on account of the elasticity of the membrane. A diagram"
of one of these forms is appended to fig. 89. In this instance the
"opening in the peritoneum was made from the abdominal aspect, prior to"
"the escape of the bullet from the cavity, and on the impact of the tip,"
the long axis of the bullet was oblique to the surface of the abdominal
wall.
In the intestinal wall the openings varied in character according to the
mode of impact.
In some cases the gut was merely contused by lateral contact of the
passing bullet. The result of this was evidenced later by the presence
of localised oval patches of ecchymosis. These were identical in
appearance with the patches shown surrounding the wounds in fig. 87.
[Illustration: FIG. 85.--Lateral Slit in Small Intestine produced by
passage of bullet. Slit somewhat obscured by deposition of inflammatory
lymph. (St. Thomas's Hospital Museum)]
"rejected. Generally, it was against the regulations and, particularly,"
it was injudicious. Down pillows would not be a factor in Unity Blake's
after-life.
"“Besides,” she remarked, “she is not the only orphan in the infirmary.”"
“Why not call it a sick-room or sick-ward instead of that prison term?”
asked John.
"“It's the name given to it by the governing body,” she replied."
After this John became a regular visitor. Every time he kicked his heels
for ten minutes in the shabby and depressing parlour and every time he
was received with glacial politeness by the Sister superintendent.
By blunt questioning he learned the history of the institution. The
Sisterhood of Saint Martha was an Angelican body with headquarters in
"Kent, which existed for meditation and not for philanthropic purposes."
The creation and conduct of the orphanage had been thrust upon the
sisterhood by the will of a member long since deceased. It was unpopular
"with the sisterhood, who resented it as an excrescence, but bore it as"
an affliction decreed by divine Providence. Among the cloistered inmates
of the Kentish manor-house there was no fanatical impulse towards
Willesden.
"They were good, religious women; but they craved retirement, and not"
"action, for the satisfying of their spiritual needs. Otherwise they"
would have joined some other sisterhood in which noble lives are spent
"in deeds of charity and love. But there are angels of wrath, angels of"
"mercy, and mere angels. These were mere angels. The possibility of being"
chosen by the Mother Superior to go out into the world again and take
"charge of the education, health, and morals of twenty sturdy and squalid"
little female orphans lived an abiding terror in their gentle breasts. A
"rear with scales. The vertebrae were not ossified, for no trace of"
them has been found.
DEVONIAN FISHES. The TRUE FISHES of the Devonian can best be
understood by reference to their descendants now living. Modern
fishes are divided into several groups: SHARKS and their allies;
"DIPNOANS; GANOIDS, such as the sturgeon and gar; and TELEOSTS,--"
"most common fishes, such as the perch and cod."
SHARKS. Of all groups of living fishes the sharks are the oldest
and still retain most fully the embryonic characters of their
Paleozoic ancestors. Such characters are the cartilaginous
"skeleton, and the separate gill slits with which the throat wall"
is pierced and which are arranged in line like the gill openings
of the lamprey. The sharks of the Silurian and Devonian are known
"to us chiefly by their teeth and fin spines, for they were"
"unprotected by scales or plates, and were devoid of a bony"
skeleton. Figure 299 is a restoration of an archaic shark from a
somewhat higher horizon. Note the seven gill slits and the
lappetlike paired fins. These fins seem to be remnants of the
"continuous fold of skin which, as embryology teaches, passed from"
fore to aft down each side of the primitive vertebrate.
Devonian sharks were comparatively small. They had not evolved
into the ferocious monsters which were later to be masters of the
seas.
"DIPNOANS, OR LUNG FISHES. These are represented to-day by a"
few peculiar fishes and are distinguished by some high structures
which ally them with amphibians. An air sac with cellular spaces
is connected with the gullet and serves as a rudimentary lung. It
"corresponds with the swim bladder of most modern fishes, and"
up with a typewriter at which the military clerk sat tapping. The
Colonel's personal luggage had been placed in his bedroom. A soldier
was even sweeping up all traces of the invasion of armed men and
making everything tidy. It all seemed like a horrid dream that was
going to end up happily after all. Presently Vivie would wake up
"completely and there would even be no Oberst, no orderly; only the"
peaceful life of the farm that was going on yesterday. Here a sound
of angry voices interrupted her musings. The cows returning by
themselves from the pasture were being intercepted by soldiers who
were trying to secure them. Vivie in her indignation ran out and
"ordered the soldiers off, in English. To her surprise they obeyed"
"silently, but as they sauntered away to their quarters she was"
saddened at seeing them carrying the bodies of most of the turkeys
and fowls and even the corpse of the poor tailless peacock. They had
waited for sundown to rob the hen-roosts.
Very much disillusioned she ran to the morning room and burst in on
"the Colonel's dictation to his clerk. ""Excuse me, but if you don't"
keep your soldiers in better order you will have very little to eat
whilst you are here. They are killing and carrying off all our
"poultry."""
The Colonel flushed a little at the peremptory way in which she
"spoke, but without replying went out and shouted a lot of orders in"
German. His orderly summoned soldiers from the barn and together
they drove the cows into the cow-sheds. All the Flemish servants
"having disappeared in a panic, the Germans had to milk the cows that"
"evening; and Vivie, assisted by the orderly, cooked the evening"
"meal in the kitchen. He was, like his Colonel, a Saxon, a"
"pleasant-featured, domesticated man, who explained civilly in the"
Thuringian dialect--though to Vivie there could be no discrimination
"between varieties of High German--that the Sachsen folk were ""Eines"
"Miss Lindon's heart sank. She had lived in suburbs all her life, and"
found Croydon--the Lord knows why--the most delectable of them all. She
had sat under Mr. Moneyfeather of Saint Michael's for many years--such
"a dear, good man who preached such eloquent sermons! You could always"
"understand him, too, which was a great comfort. And the church was just"
"round the corner. In London folks had to go to church by omnibus, a most"
"unpleasant and possibly irreverent prelude to divine worship. Besides,"
"when you did get to the sacred edifice, you found yourself in a"
"confusing land where all the clergy, even to the humblest deacon,"
"were austere and remote strangers, who looked at members of their"
congregation with glassy and unsympathetic eyes when they passed them
"in the street. Here, in Croydon, on the contrary, when she met Mr."
"Moneyfeather in public places, he held her hand and patted it and"
inquired affectionately after Dandy's health. With a London vicar she
could not conceive the possibility of such privileged terms of intimacy.
"London, where you did not know your next-door neighbor, and where you"
took no interest in the births of babies over the way; where no one
"ran in for a gossip in the mornings; where every street was a clashing,"

"But though her face pictured her dismay, she was too generous to"
translate it into words. John never guessed her sacrifice.
"“We 'll go somewhere quiet,” said he, after a while."
"“We 'll go wherever you like, dear,” replied Miss Lindon, meekly, and"
she rang the bell for tea.
"The main point decided, they proceeded to discuss the details of the"
"scheme, the minds of each suffused in a misty wonder. If John had told"
the simple lady that she could serve him by taking command of a cavalry
"regiment, she would have agreed in her unselfish fashion, but she would"
"The Captain's eyes were alight with happiness, and his face red with"
"excitement.  He worked upon Vaviloff's greed, and urging upon him the"
"importance of immediate action in the matter, went away in a very"
joyful and happy frame of mind.

"In the evening everyone was told of the Captain's discovery, and they"
"all began to discuss Petunikoff's future predicament, painting in vivid"
colours his excitement and astonishment on the day the court messenger
handed him the copy of the summons.  The Captain felt himself quite a
hero.  He was happy and all his friends highly pleased. The heap of
dark and tattered figures that lay in the courtyard made noisy
"demonstrations of pleasure. They all knew the merchant, Petunikoff, who"
"passed them very often, contemptuously turning up his eyes and giving"
them no more attention than he bestowed on the other heaps of rubbish
"lying on the ground.  He was well fed, and that exasperated them still"
more; and now how splendid it was that one of themselves had struck a
hard blow at the selfish merchant's purse!  It gave them all the
greatest pleasure.  The Captain's discovery was a powerful instrument
in their hands.  Every one of them felt keen animosity towards all
"those who were well fed and well dressed, but in some of them this"
feeling was only beginning to develop. Burning interest was felt by
"those ""creatures that once were men"" in the prospective fight between"
"Kuvalda and Petunikoff, which they already saw in imagination."
For a fortnight the inhabitants of the dosshouse awaited the further
"development of events, but Petunikoff never once visited the building."
It was known that he was not in town and that the copy of the petition
had not yet been handed to him.  Kuvalda raged at the delays of the
civil court.  It is improbable that anyone had ever awaited the
merchant with such impatience as did this bare-footed brigade.
picked from among them to act as her nurse.
And if it did not occur to her to question either his power or his
"perfect right to dispose of her future also as he might see fit, had not"
"all her experience gone to prove that might is right everywhere, that"
law and justice are merely additional pretexts devised by the strong for
oppressing the weak? She had had to choose between remaining on board
"the _Olive Branch_, or paying Jasper Slyne his price for the chance of"
escape he had offered her in pursuance of his own aims.
She disliked and distrusted Slyne scarcely less than before. But she did
"not see how she could have chosen otherwise. And, in any case,--it was"
too late now to revoke the promise she had made him.
She was still afraid to place any faith in the promises he had made
her. She had no idea how he had come at his alleged discovery of her
real identity. But Mr. Jobling's obvious belief in that recurred to her
"mind, and she fell to wondering timidly what life would be like as Lady"
Josceline Justice.
"Her impressions on that point were very hazy, however, and she had still"
to puzzle out the problem added by Justin Carthew. But she finally gave
"up the attempt to solve that at the moment, contenting herself with the"
"tremulous hope that she might soon be on her way toward that dear,"
"unknown, dream-home for which her hungry heart had so often ached."
Of the exorbitant price so soon to be paid for the brief glimpse of
"happiness Slyne had agreed to allow her, she took no further thought at"
all. She had already made up her mind to meet that without complaint.
"An hour or more later, when Slyne looked in to tell her that it was time"
"to start, she was still seated at the window, gazing out over the"
own daughter had once belonged to another--father.  He had told the
"lawyer in a measured voice that he would see the fellow damned first, and"
"had directed a deed of separation to be prepared, which should provide"
for the complete payment of Fiorsen's existing debts on condition that he
"left Gyp and the baby in peace.  After telling Gyp this, he took an"
opportunity of going to the extempore nursery and standing by the baby's
"cradle.  Until then, the little creature had only been of interest as"
"part of Gyp; now it had for him an existence of its own--this tiny,"
"dark-eyed creature, lying there, watching him so gravely, clutching his"
"finger.  Suddenly the baby smiled--not a beautiful smile, but it made on"
Winton an indelible impression.
"Wishing first to settle this matter of the deed, he put off going down to"
"Mildenham; but ""not trusting those two scoundrels a yard""--for he never"
failed to bracket Rosek and Fiorsen--he insisted that the baby should not
"go out without two attendants, and that Gyp should not go out alone.  He"
carried precaution to the point of accompanying her to Monsieur Harmost's
"on the Friday afternoon, and expressed a wish to go in and shake hands"
with the old fellow.  It was a queer meeting.  Those two had as great
difficulty in finding anything to say as though they were denizens of
"different planets. And indeed, there ARE two planets on this earth!"
"When, after a minute or so of the friendliest embarrassment, he had"
"retired to wait for her, Gyp sat down to her lesson."
Monsieur Harmost said quietly:
"""Your letter was very kind, my little friend--and your father is very"
"kind.  But, after all, it was a compliment your husband paid me.""  His"
"smile smote Gyp; it seemed to sum up so many resignations.  ""So you stay"
"again with your father!""  And, looking at her very hard with his"
"melancholy brown eyes, ""When will you find your fate, I wonder?"""
appears to have had a common origin with it. We may conceive that
the primordial fishes not only had gills used in breathing air
"dissolved in water, but also developed a saclike pouch off the"
gullet. This sac evolved along two distinct lines. On the line of
the ancestry of most modern fishes its duct was closed and it
became the swim bladder used in flotation and balancing. On
"another line of descent it was left open, air was swallowed into"
"it, and it developed into the rudimentary lung of the dipnoans and"
into the more perfect lungs of the amphibians and other air-
breathing vertebrates.
One of the ancient dipnoans is illustrated in Figure 300. Some of
"the members of this order were, like the ostracoderms, cased in"
"armor, but their higher rank is shown by their powerful jaws and"
by other structures. Some of these armored fishes reached twenty-
five feet in length and six feet across the head. They were the
tyrants of the Devonian seas.
GANOIDS. These take their name from their enameled plates or
scales of bone. The few genera now surviving are the descendants
of the tribes which swarmed in the Devonian seas. A restoration of
"one of a leading order, the FRINGE-FINNED ganoids, is given in"
"Figure 301. The side fins, which correspond to the limbs of the"
"higher vertebrates, are quite unlike those of most modern fishes."
"Their rays, instead of radiating from a common base, fringe a"
central lobe which contains a cartilaginous axis. The teeth of the
Devonian ganoids show a complicated folded structure.
GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF DEVONIAN FISHES. THE NOTOCHORD IS
"PERSISTENT. The notochord is a continuous rod of cartilage, or"
"gristle, which in the embryological growth of vertebrate animals"
supports the spinal nerve cord before the formation of the
Eppendorf employs spies everywhere who watch Erasmus's correspondence
"with his friends. Aleander continually sets people to combat him, and"
lies in wait for him wherever he can. His interpretation of the
intentions of his assailants has the ingenious self-centred element
which passes the borderline of sanity. He sees the whole world full of
calumny and ambuscades threatening his peace: nearly all those who once
were his best friends have become his bitterest enemies; they wag their
"venomous tongues at banquets, in conversation, in the confessional, in"
"sermons, in lectures, at court, in vehicles and ships. The minor"
"enemies, like troublesome vermin, drive him to weariness of life, or to"
death by insomnia. He compares his tortures to the martyrdom of Saint
"Sebastian, pierced by arrows. But his is worse, for there is no end to"
it. For years he has daily been dying a thousand deaths and that alone;
"for his friends, if such there are, are deterred by envy."
He mercilessly pillories his patrons in a row for their stinginess. Now
and again there suddenly comes to light an undercurrent of aversion and
hatred which we did not suspect. Where had more good things fallen to
his lot than in England? Which country had he always praised more? But
suddenly a bitter and unfounded reproach escapes him. England is
"responsible for his having become faithless to his monastic vows, 'for"
"no other reason do I hate Britain more than for this, though it has"
always been pestilent to me'.
He seldom allows himself to go so far. His expressions of hatred or
"spite are, as a rule, restricted to the feline. They are aimed at"
"friends and enemies, Budaeus, Lypsius, as well as Hutten and Beda."
Occasionally we are struck by the expression of coarse pleasure at
"another's misfortune. But in all this, as regards malice, we should not"
measure Erasmus by our ideas of delicacy and gentleness. Compared with
most of his contemporaries he remains moderate and refined.
"ingenuity to keep them alive during the journey. Four plants, two"
"Mimosas and two Telegraph plants, were taken in a portable box with"
"glass cover, and never let out of sight. In the Mediterranean they"
encountered bitter cold for the first time and nearly succumbed. They
"were unhappier still in the Bay of Biscay, and when they reached London"
there was a sharp frost. They had to be kept in a drawing room lighted
"by gas, the deadly influence of which was discovered the next morning"
when all the plants were found to be apparently killed. Two had been
"killed, and the other two were brought round after much difficulty. The"
plants were at once transferred to the hot-house in Regents Park. For
"every demonstration in Dr. Bose's private Laboratory at Maida Vale, the"
plant had to be brought and returned in a taxicab with closed doors so
"that no sudden chill might kill them. When travelling, the large box in"
"which they were, could not be trusted out of sight in the luggage van."
They had practically to be carried in a reserved compartment. The
"unusual care taken of the box always roused the greatest curiosity, and"
in an incredibly short time large crowds would gather. When travelling
"long distances, for example from London to Vienna, the carriage"
accommodation had to be secured in advance. It was this that saved Dr.
"Bose from being interned in Germany, where he was to commence his"
lectures on the 4th August. He was to start for the University of Bonn
"on the 2nd, but on account of hasty mobilisation of troops in Germany he"
could not secure the reserved accommodation. Two days after came the
proclamation of War!
OUTCOME OF HIS WORK
The success of his scientific mission exceeded his most sanguine
expectations. The work in which he long persevered in isolation and
"under most depressing difficulties, bore fruit at last. Apart from the"
full recognition that the progress of the world's science would be
corrected edition of the New Testament. He did not fail to request the
chiefs of conservative divinity at Louvain beforehand to state their
objections to his work. Briard of Ath declared he had found nothing
"offensive in it, after he had first been told all sorts of bad things"
"about it. 'Then the new edition will please you much better,' Erasmus"
"had said. His friend Dorp and James Latomus, also one of the chief"
"divines, had expressed themselves in the same sense, and the Carmelite"
Nicholas of Egmond had said that he had never read Erasmus's work. Only
"a young Englishman, Edward Lee, who was studying Greek at Louvain, had"
summarized a number of criticisms into ten conclusions. Erasmus had got
rid of the matter by writing to Lee that he had not been able to get
hold of his conclusions and therefore could not make use of them. But
"his youthful critic had not put up with being slighted so, and worked"
out his objections in a more circumstantial treatise.
"[Illustration: XVII. VIEW OF BASLE, 1548]"
Thus Erasmus set out for Basle once more in May 1518. He had been
obliged to ask all his English friends (of whom Ammonius had been taken
from him by death in 1517) for support to defray the expenses of the
"journey; he kept holding out to them the prospect that, after his work"
"was finished, he would return to England. In a letter to Martin Lypsius,"
"as he was going up the Rhine, he answered Lee's criticism, which had"
irritated him extremely. In revising his edition he not only took it but
"little into account, but ventured, moreover, this time to print his own"
translation of the New Testament of 1506 without any alterations. At the
same time he obtained for the new edition a letter of approval from the
"Pope, a redoubtable weapon against his cavillers."
At Basle Erasmus worked again like a horse in a treadmill. But he was
really in his element. Even before the second edition of the New
"Testament, the _Enchiridion_ and the _Institutio Principis Christiani_"
found herself skirting the high-paled ironwork which confines the
"palace. She pursued her way towards the town, taking care, however, to"
look sharply about her so that she might miss nothing.
"The palace grounds seemed utterly deserted. The fountains slept; ""Fame"""
drove no longer her waters fifty yards into the air; the Frogs rested
from their ungrateful labours open-mouthed and gasping for breath. Not
"even a gardener was to be seen scratching weeds on a path, or in the"
dimmest distance passing at random across one of the deep-shaded
"avenues. An unholy quiet seemed to have settled upon the place, the"
"marvel of Castile, the most elevated of earthly palaces, broken only by"
"the sombre tolling of the chapel bell, which would cease for five"
"minutes without apparent reason, and then, equally without cause, begin"
all over again its lugubrious chime.
"Down the zigzags towards the town went La Giralda, the goats taking"
"advantage of the wider paths to stray further afield, and needing more"
"frequently the touch of the wand, which the old woman had taken from the"
donkey's load in order to induce them to proceed.
"As the gipsy passed along, a small shrill voice called upon her to stop,"
"and from a side walk, concealed by roses and oleander bushes, late"
"flowering because of the great elevation, a richly-dressed little girl"
came running. She ran at the top of her speed towards the gilt railings
which towered high above her head. Her age appeared to be about that of
the little girl whom La Giralda had buried among the pottery shards in
that other meaner garden up on the mountain side.
"""Stop,"" she cried imperiously, ""I bid you stop! I am the Queen, and you"
must obey me. I have not seen any one for five days except stupid old
"Susana, who will be after me in a moment. Stop, I tell you! I want to"
"see your goats milked. I love milk, and they will not give me enough,"
between the Governing Class and the People. Curiously enough the
respective responsive characteristics of the Anglo Saxon and the Indians
are paralleled by the two types of responses seen in all living matter.
In the one type the response is slow but proportionate to the stimulus
that excites it. The response grows with the strength of external force.
In the other it is quite different--here it is an all-or-none principle.
It either responds to the utmost or nothing at all. This is also
illustrated in the different racial characteristics. The Anglo Saxon has
"even by his rights by struggle, step by step. The insignificant little"
"has, by accumulation, became large, and which has been gained, has been"
gained for all time. But in the Indian the ideal and the emotional are
"the only effective stimulus. The ideal of his King is Rama, who"
renounced his kingdom and even his beloved for an idea. One day a king
and another day a bare-footed wanderer in the forest! Who cares? All or
nothing!
The concessions made by a modern form of Government safeguarded by
necessary limitations may appear almost as grudging gifts. The Indian
wants something which comes with unhesitating frankness and warmth and
strikes his ideality and imagination. But ancient and modern kingship
are sometimes at one in direct and spontaneous pronouncement of the
royal sympathy. Such was the Proclamation of Queen Victoria which
stirred to its depths the popular heart.
"""In the Prosperity of Our subjects will be our strength, in their"
"contentment Our security, in their Gratitude Our best Reward."""
That there are increasingly frequent reflexes in our Government to
popular needs and wishes is happily illustrated at a most opportune
moment from the statements in the recent _Gazette of India_ and cables
received from London. In the former we find that the Viceroy and his
council had recommended the abolition of the system of indentured
"a gardener, not a dog, not even a soldier on guard to salute me or let"
"me examine his sword-bayonet. And now when this dear, this sweet old"
"Señora comes by with her lovely, lovely goats, you must perforce try to"
pull me off as if I were a village child that had played truant from the
"monks' school and must be birched for its fault!"""
"All the while she was speaking, the young Princess directed a shower of"
"harmless blows at the skirts of her attendant, which Doña Susana"
"laughingly warded off, begging all the while for pity, and instancing"
"the direct commands of the little girl's mother, apparently a very"
"exalted personage indeed, as a reason for her interference."
"But Isabel of Spain was not to be appeased, and presently she had"
recourse to tears in the midst of her fury.
"""You hate me--I know you do--that is what it means,"" she cried, ""you"
"would not have me happy even for a moment. But one day I shall be Queen,"
"and do as I like! Yes, and drink as much warm goat's milk as I want, in"
"spite of all the stupid, wicked, cruel Susanas in the world. And I shall"
throw you into a dungeon with nothing but mice and rats and serpents and
"centipedes--yes, and snails that leave a white slimy trail over you"
"when they crawl! Ugh! And I will have your hands tied, so that you shall"
"not be able to brush them off when they tickle your neck. Yes, I will,"
"Susana! I swear it, and I am growing big--so big! And soon I shall be"
"old enough to have you put in prison with the mice and snails, bad"
"Susana! Oh, wicked Susana!"""
"Now, whether these childish threats actually had some effect, or whether"
"the old lady was so soft-hearted as her comfortable appearance denoted,"
certain it is that she took a key from her pocket and passed it through
the tall gilt railings to La Giralda.
Could any one doubt who the other person in that strangely revealed
"photograph was, or fail to guess the relation between the man they had"
"been listening to and the man who was dead? A few had known Benyon, more"
"Gaspard, all Medland--the three figures of this drama; many remembered"
"the fourth, the central character, who had not tarried for the end of"
"it: the man was rare who did not spend a thought on the bright girl,"
"whose face was so familiar in these walls, and who must be dragged into"
"it. Where was she? asked one. She was gone. Norburn, with rapid"
"instinct, as soon as he had read, had run to her and forced her to go"
"home. He was back from escorting her now, and walked up and down with"
"hands behind him, speaking to no one among all the busily babbling"
throng.
"The waverers stood in a little group by themselves, talking earnestly in"
"undertones, while men wondered whether the paper would undo what the"
"speech had done, and whether the Premier's words had won a victory, only"
for his deeds to leap to light and rob it from him again.
"Inside, the debate lagged on, surely the dullest, emptiest, most"
neglected debate that had ever decided the fate of a Government. The men
who had been set down to speak came in and spoke and went out again; a
"House was kept, but with little to spare. Sir Robert went in and took"
"his place, opposite Medland, who never stirred through all the hours."
"Presently Sir Robert wrote a note, twisted it, and flung it to the"
"Premier. ""A splendid performance of yours, _mes compliments_,"" it said,"
"and, when Medland looked across to acknowledge it, Sir Robert smiled"
"kindly, and nodded his silver head, and the Premier answered him with a"
"glad gleam in his deep-set eyes. These two men, who were always"
"fighting, knew one another, and liked one another for what they knew."
"And this little episode done, Sir Robert rose and pricked and pinked the"
"Premier's points, making sharp fun of his heroics, and weightily"
"criticising his proposals. Now the House did fill a little, for after"
That is part of our belief; that is the strongest part of our belief;
"and that is the hope that all fervent Christians have, that those they"
love may be saved even at the end.
I think it may truly be said that our Western creeds are all directed at
"the hour of death, as the great and final test of that creed."
And now think of Buddhism; it is a creed of life. In life you must win
"your way to salvation by urgent effort, by suffering, by endurance. On"
"your death-bed you can do nothing. If you have done well, then it is"
"well; if ill, then you must in future life try again and again till you"
"succeed. A life is not washed, a soul is not made fit for the dwelling"
"of eternity, in a moment."
Repentance to a Buddhist is but the opening of the eyes to see the path
to righteousness; it has no virtue in itself. To have seen that we are
sinners is but the first step to cleansing our sin; in itself it cannot
purify.
"As well ask a robber of the poor to repent, and suppose thereby that"
those who have suffered from his guilt are compensated for the evil done
"to them by his repentance, as to ask a Buddhist to believe that a sinner"
can at the last moment make good to his own soul all the injuries caused
to that soul by the wickedness of his life.
Or suppose a man who has destroyed his constitution by excess to be by
the very fact of acknowledging that excess restored to health.
The Buddhist will not have that at all. A man is what he makes himself;
"and that making is a matter of terrible effort, of unceasing endeavour"
"towards the right, of constant suppression of sin, till sin be at last"
"had written long ago and read it through, sweet and tender memories"
"crowded upon me, and in my eyes stood blinding tears.  I may be forgiven"
"for this, I think, when it is remembered how fondly I had once loved"
"Yolande, before that fatal day when jealousy had consumed me, and I had"
turned my back upon her as a woman false and worthless.
"Letter after letter I read, each bringing back to me sad memories of"
"those days, when in the calm sunset hour we had wandered by the"
"riverside hand in hand like children, each supremely content in each"
"other's love, fondly believing that our mad passion would last always."
"In all the world she had been, to me, incomparable.  The centre of"
"admiration at those brilliant balls at the Royal Palace at Brussels, the"
most admired of all the trim and comely girls who rode at morning in the
"Bois, the merriest of those who picnicked in the forest round about the"
"ancient chateau, the sweetest, the most tender, and the most pure of all"
"the women I knew--Yolande in those days had been mine.  There, in my"
"hand, I held the letter which I had written from Scotland when on leave"
"for the shooting, asking if she loved me sufficiently to become my wife."
"To that letter I well remembered her reply--indeed, I knew it verbatim;"
"a tender letter, full of honest love and straightforward admission--a"
"letter such as only a pure and good woman could have penned.  Yes, she"
"wrote that she loved me dearly, and would be my wife."
And yet it was all of the past.  All had ended.
"I sighed bitterly--how bitterly, mere words cannot describe.  You,"
"reader, be you man or woman, can you fully realise how deeply I felt at"
"that moment, how utterly desolate the world then seemed to me?"
"Those letters I slowly replaced in the cavity and closed it.  Then, as I"
"turned away, my eyes fell upon the photographs standing upon a small"
whatnot close by the escritoire.  They were of persons whom I did not

above and 1-1/2 inch within the left anterior superior iliac
"spine; _exit_, 1-1/2 inch to the right of the tenth dorsal"
spinous process. The same bullet had perforated the forearm
just above the wrist prior to entering the abdomen. No local or
constitutional signs indicated either bowel injury or
"perforation of liver. The man, however, was suffering from a"
"slight attack of dysentery, passing blood and mucus per rectum"
with great tenesmus. He was sent to the Base at the end of a
"week, and returned to England well three weeks later. He"
"attributed his dysentery to the wound, as the symptoms did not"
exist prior to its reception; but as the disease coincided
exactly with what was very prevalent amongst the troops at the
"time, I do not think there was any connection between it and"
the injury.

The bowels acted involuntarily simultaneously with the
"vomiting, and incontinence of fæces and retention of urine"
persisted for four days. The vomit was bilious in appearance;
no blood was seen either in it or the motions.
Forty-six hours after the injury the condition was as follows:
"Face slightly anxious and pale; skin moist, temperature 100.4°;"
"pulse 116, regular and of fair strength; respirations 24;"
ensure his overthrow and defeat; and Grey had his suspicions that Lord
Sandford had hoped that he might then and there break his neck—a thing
which might very well have happened.
"There was a crowd round the spot now, and great horror was expressed by"
"many at sight of the unsuspected well, no voice being louder than Lord"
Sandford’s in proclaiming astonishment and indignation. But Grey took no
"notice of the clamour, only busying himself about his horse; and"
"presently, with some difficulty, the sagacious and docile creature was"
"got out, and it appeared that no limb was broken, though one hock was"
"deeply cut, and one shoulder badly strained."
"Grey stood in silent thought awhile, his hand upon the neck of his"
"favourite, who stood with drooping head and dejected mien, as though"
wondering whether he would ever be whole and sound again.  Dick was
"binding up the wound, his face like a thunder-cloud. A knot of persons"
of all ranks stood watching at a little distance; but Grey had
"courteously waved away all proffers of help, and indicated that he"
desired no attentions.
"""Dicon,"" he said in a low tone, ""we must now part for a while.  Don"
"Carlos will need you more than I.  He is now my sole fortune, and must"
"be respected as such.  Take him and your own nag, and walk them both by"
"easy stages to Hartsbourne. There are paddocks enough and to spare, and"
I surely have the right to pasture my horse in one; but if the thing
"should come to my kinsman’s ears, give him what is due in money, and I"
will repay you.  Old Jock Jarvis will be your friend.  He will rejoice
"in your company and give you house-room with him, and it is not so far"
but that I can get news of you from time to time.  Your good horse will
bring you to London in three hours or less any day you have a mind to

"again."""
"of the excited Don Carlos, and brought him up to his appointed place"
docile and motionless.
"The word was given, but the black stallion had bounded off a few seconds"
"too soon, and had to be recalled.  A second start was spoiled by two"
"other competitors, who suddenly reared at each other, and strove to"
"fight.  One iron hoof, indeed, inflicted such a wound upon the shoulder"
of his neighbour that that horse had to be taken away limping and
bleeding.
"It was trying to all, horses and riders alike; but at the third start"
"all got off, though Grey saw that again the black stallion had made his"
"bound a second too soon.  This gave him a few yards the advantage,"
"which, as his rider pressed him hard from the first, and his temper was"
"evidently up, he increased in the next minute to more than a length."
"The Arab and Don Carlos were neck and neck, and sailed over the first"
"easy jump side by side, the stallion having cleared it with a tremendous"
bound a couple of seconds earlier.
"The water jump was next, and it was obvious that one spot offered"
greater advantages to the horse than any other.  The stallion made for
"this spot with a rush, took off and bounded clear over, just as Don"
"Carlos and the Arab came rushing up neck and neck, each rider desirous"
of the advantage of the sound bank.  Grey set his teeth and glanced at
"his adversary.  A collision at the leap might be fatal to one or both,"
so far as the race went.  His rival would not budge an inch—that he saw.
"With a muttered oath between his teeth, he pulled his left rein, and"
"used his knees.  Don Carlos felt, and instantly understood: swerving"
"slightly, he gathered himself together, and rose magnificently where the"
"water was wider and the bank less safe; but he landed safely, and with a"
"hardly perceptible scramble found his feet again, and amid the plaudits"
"of the people raced on after the Arab, who, having got a momentary"
more frequent lightnings he saw that it was drawn and gray.
"""There lies his lair,"" the duke pointed to the white masonry of"
"Astura, as it loomed out of the night, menacing and spectral, as a"
"thunderbolt hissed into the sea, and again lapsed into gloom."
"""Betrayer of God and man,--his hour is at hand!""--"
"The duke's beard fairly bristled as he uttered these words, and he"
gripped the hilt of his sword as if he anticipated a conflict with
"some wild beast of the forest, some mythical monster born of night and"
crime.
Francesco made no reply. He was bowed down beneath the gloom of the
"hour, oppressed with unutterable forebodings. He too had an account to"
"settle: yet, whichever way the tongue inclined in the scales, life"
stretched out from him as a sea at night. He dared not think of
"Ilaria, far away in the convent of San Nicandro by the sea; yet her"
"memory had haunted him all day, knocked at the gates of his"
"consciousness, dominated the hours. Compared with the ever present"
"sense of her loss, all in life seemed utterly trifling, and he longed"
for annihilation only.
Yet a kindred note which he sounded in the duke's soul found him in a
more receptive mood for the latter's confidences; once life had
"seemed good to him; he had thought men heroes, the world a faerie"
"place. Thoughts had changed with time, and that for which he once"
"hungered he now despised. Cursed with perversities, baffled and"
"mocked, the eternal trivialities of life made the soul sink within"
"him. Not all are mild earth, to be smitten and make no moan. There are"
"sea spirits that lash and foam, fire spirits that leap and burn,--was"
he to be cursed because he was born with a soul of fire?
will not fight for their lives. There is nothing of the sporting
proposition in pursuing them that is to be found in hunting the tiger or
"the grizzly. They are practically harmless, and in the Bayano region"
"wholly so, as there are no domestic animals upon which they can prey. It"
"is true their teeth and skins have a certain value in the market, but it"
is not for these the tourist kills them. Most of those slain for “sport”
sink instantly and cannot be recovered.

However if you visit Crocodile Creek with a typical party you will be
given a very fair imitation of a lively skirmish in actual war. From
"every part of the deck, from the roof of the cabin, and from the pilot"
house shots ring out from repeating rifles in a fierce desire to kill.
The Emersonian doctrine of compensation is often given illustration by
the killing of one of the hunters in the eagerness to get at the quarry.
In fact that is one of the commonest accidents of the tourist season in
Panama.
[Illustration: MAHOGANY TREES WITH ORCHIDS]
"Crocodile Creek is a deep, sluggish black stream, almost arched over by"
the boughs of the thick forest along the shores. Here and there the
jungle is broken by a broad shelving beach on which the ungainly beasts
"love to sun themselves, and to which the females resort to deposit their"
eggs. At the sound of a voice or a paddle in the stream the awkward
"brutes take to the water in terror, for there are few animals more"
"timid than they. When in the water the crocodile floats lazily,"
displaying only three small bumps above the surface--the nostrils and
the horny protruberances above the eyes. Once the pool in which they
float is disturbed they sink to the bottom and lurk there for hours.
Alligator hunting for business purposes is not as yet generally pursued
"""Go down a hundred yards or so,"" she said, ""and there you will find a"
gate. Open it with that key and bring over your animals to the little
"pavilion among the trees by the fountain."""
Upon hearing this the Princess instantly changed her tune. She had got
"her own way, and now it was ""Beautiful Doña Susana! Precious and"
"loveliest companion, when I am Queen you shall have the greatest and"
"handsomest grandee in the kingdom to be your husband, and walk in"
"diamonds and rubies at our court balls! Yes, you shall. I promise it by"
my royal oath. And now I will run to the house kitchen for basins to
"catch the goats' milk in, and my little churn to churn the butter"
"in--and--and----"""
But before she had catalogued half the things that she meant to find and
"bring she departed at the top of her speed, making the air ring with her"
shouts of delight.
"Slowly, and with the meekest dignity, La Giralda did as she was bidden."
"She found the little gate, which, indeed, proved so narrow that she"
could not get her donkey to pass through with his great side-burdens of
"fagots. But as these were not at all heavy, La Giralda herself detached"
"them, and, laying them carefully within the railings, she unhaltered the"
"patient beast and, tying him only with a cord about his neck, left him a"
generous freedom of browsing upon the royal grass-plots and undergrowth.
"The goats, however, perhaps alarmed by the trim daintiness of the place"
"and the unwonted spectacle of unlimited leaves and forage, kept close"
"together. One or two of them, indeed, smelt doubtfully at luxuriant"
"tufts, but as they had only previously seen grass in single blades, and"
"amid Saharas of gravel and sand, the experiment of eating an entire"
mouthful at a time appeared too hazardous and desperate. They were of a
"cautious turn of mind, in addition to which their udders had become so"
"The semi-private, semi-public character of the letters often made them"
compromising. What one could say to a friend in confidence might
"possibly injure when many read it. Erasmus, who never was aware how"
"injuriously he expressed himself, repeatedly gave rise to"
"misunderstanding and estrangement. Manners, so to say, had not yet"
"adapted themselves to the new art of printing, which increased the"
publicity of the written word a thousandfold. Only gradually under this
"new influence was the separation effected between the public word,"
"intended for the press, and the private communication, which remains in"
writing and is read only by the recipient.
"Meanwhile, with the growth of Erasmus's fame, his earlier writings, too,"
had risen in the public estimation. The great success of the
"_Enchiridion militis christiani_ had begun about 1515, when the times"
were much riper for it than eleven years before. 'The _Moria_ is
"embraced as the highest wisdom,' writes John Watson to him in 1516. In"
"the same year we find a word used, for the first time, which expresses"
better than anything else how much Erasmus had become a centre of
"authority: _Erasmiani_. So his German friends called themselves,"
according to Johannes Sapidus. More than a year later Dr. Johannes Eck
"employs the word still in a rather friendly sense, as a generally"
"current term: 'all scholars in Germany are Erasmians,' he says. But"
"Erasmus did not like the word. 'I find nothing in myself', he replies,"
"'why anyone should wish to be an Erasmicus, and, altogether, I hate"
"those party names. We are all followers of Christ, and to His glory we"
"all drudge, each for his part.' But he knows that now the question is:"
for or against him! From the brilliant latinist and the man of wit of
his prime he had become the international pivot on which the
civilization of his age hinged. He could not help beginning to feel
"himself the brain, the heart and the conscience of his times. It might"
even appear to him that he was called to speak the great redeeming word
"or, perhaps, that he had already spoken it. The faith in an easy triumph"
"no peace. Nevertheless, when he is seriously ill he does not fear death."
"His hygienics amount to temperance, cleanliness and fresh air, this last"
item in moderation: he takes the vicinity of the sea to be unwholesome
"and is afraid of draughts. His friend Gilles, who is ill, he advises:"
"'Do not take too much medicine, keep quiet and do not get angry'. Though"
"there is a 'Praise of Medicine' among his works, he does not think"
highly of physicians and satirizes them more than once in the
_Colloquies_.
Also in his outward appearance there were certain features betraying his
"delicacy. He was of medium height, well-made, of a fair complexion with"
"blond hair and blue eyes, a cheerful face, a very articulate mode of"
"speech, but a thin voice."
In the moral sphere Erasmus's delicacy is represented by his great need
"of friendship and concord, his dislike of contention. With him peace and"
"harmony rank above all other considerations, and he confesses them to be"
"the guiding principles of his actions. He would, if it might be, have"
all the world as a friend. 'Wittingly I discharge no one from my
"friendship,' he says. And though he was sometimes capricious and"
"exacting towards his friends, yet a truly great friend he was: witness"
"the many who never forsook him, or whom he, after a temporary"
"estrangement, always won back--More, Peter Gilles, Fisher, Ammonius,"
"Budaeus, and others too numerous to mention. 'He was most constant in"
"keeping up friendships,' says Beatus Rhenanus, whose own attachment to"
Erasmus is a proof of the strong affection he could inspire.
At the root of this desire of friendship lies a great and sincere need
of affection. Remember the effusions of almost feminine affection
towards Servatius during his monastic period. But at the same time it is
"a sort of moral serenity that makes him so: an aversion to disturbance,"
I knew I had come into contact with the truly representative man. His
"opinion and the opinions of those like him, they all made up popular"
opinion. All other opinion was abnormal and negligible. It was with
despair that I realized the hopelessness of my own position and that of
my friends.
The public did not understand the war and did not want to understand it.
It was far away from them and they did not realize the amount of
suffering caused by it. It also brought wealth to many who would
therefore have regretted its sudden termination. This seems a hard thing
"to say, but nevertheless it is true. The so-called ""working-classes"" had"
developed an appetite for wealth and power that nothing could satisfy.
"This appetite was being fed continually, but the more it devoured the"
more voracious it became. Nor did the shameless profiteering of the
wealthy tend to allay it in any way. Protests against the war never went
beyond the passing of mere resolutions. Those who had sufficient
humanity and imagination to hate the war in its entirety and to suffer
"from it, although not necessarily taking any part in it, were too few"
and too scattered and isolated to take any effective action.
The extent to which a man can suffer is the precise measure of his
"merit, and thus it was that our patriots and war-enthusiasts being"
"incapable, by reason of their grossness and vulgarity, of suffering in a"
"spiritual sense, were immune from the misery caused by the war and yet"
it was they above all others upon whose support the continuance of the
war depended.
This was the terrible fatality. The more a man suffered from the war the
smaller was his control over it.
"Everywhere, those who deserved to suffer did not suffer and those who"
Panamanian farmer will never incur the scriptural curse laid upon them
"that lay field unto field. He farms just enough for his daily needs, no"
more. The ambition that leads our northern farmer to always covet the
lands on the other side of his boundary fence does not operate in
"Panama. One reason is, of course, the aggressiveness of the jungle."
"Stubborn to clear away, it is determined in its efforts to regain the"
land from which it has been ousted. Such a thing as allowing a field to
lie fallow for two or three years is unknown in Panama. There would be
no field visible for the new jungle growth.
[Illustration: A FORD NEAR ANCON]
"Agriculture therefore is conducted in a small way only, except for the"
great corporations that have just begun the exploitation of Panama.
Whether the country affords a hopeful field for the individual settler
is at least doubtful. Its climate is excellent. The days are warm but
never scorchingly hot as are customary in Washington and frequent in New
York. The nights are cool. From December to May a steady trade wind
"blows over the Isthmus from north to south, carrying away the clouds so"
"that there is no rain. In this dry season the fruits mature, so that it"
corresponds to the northern summer; on the other hand such vegetation as
"sheds its leaves, or dies down annually, does so at this season, giving"
it a seeming correspondence to the northern winter. In a temperature
"sense there is neither summer nor winter, and the variation of the"
thermometer is within narrow limits. The highest temperature in years at
"Culebra, a typical inland point, was 96 degrees; the lowest 61."
The list of natural products of the Isthmus is impressive in its length
"and variety, but for most of them even the home demand is not met or"
supplied by the production. Only where some stimulating force from the
"outside has intervened, like the United Fruit Company with the banana,"
has production been brought up to anything like its possibility. In the
"nursing, not to speak of some excellent whisky that she happened to have"
"stored away in her cabin, had pulled him through. With a sigh of relief"
she threw herself down on the rug for a much-needed rest.
"The man woke just before the sun rose. His first thought, that he was"
"home in the foothills, was dissipated by the sight of the snow ranges."
"Through the window of the cabin, as far as the eye could see, nothing of"
"green was visible. Snow was everywhere; everything was white, save at"
the eastern horizon where silver was fast changing into rose and rose to
a fiery red as the fast-rising sun sent its shafts over the snow-coated
mountains.
And now there came to him a full realisation of what had happened and
"where he was. To his amazement, though, he was almost without pain. That"
"his wound had been dressed he was, of course, well aware for when he"
attempted to draw back still further the curtain at the window the
"movement strained the tight bandage, and he was instantly made conscious"
of a twinge of pain.
"Nevertheless, he persevered, for he wisely decided that it would be well"
"to reconnoitre, to familiarise himself, as much as possible, with the"
lay of the land and find out whether the trail that he had followed to
"reach the cabin which, he recalled, was perched high up above a ravine,"
was the only means of communication with the valley below. It was a
"useless precaution, for the snow would have wholly obliterated any such"
"trail had there been one and, soon realising the fact, he fell back"
exhausted by his effort on the pillows.
"A half hour passed and the man began to grow restless. He had, of"
"course, no idea whatever of the length of time he had been in the cabin,"
and he knew that he must be thinking of an immediate escape. In
"desperation, he tried to get out of bed, but the task was beyond his"
"woods yet, but a good beginning always means a lot, and he had no word"
to say against this start-off.
"Presently the various driving crews appeared, wet to the skin from the"
"waist down, and ravenously hungry. The drying racks were swiftly"
"steaming with the soggy garments, and the men fell to upon their supper"
without a second’s delay. There was little conversation--they were too
busy for that; but Bainbridge noticed with satisfaction that a certain
element of good-tempered raillery seemed to prevail. Evidently the crowd
as a whole bore no grudge against the man who had given them such a
"tongue-lashing that morning. In fact, if one could judge from their"
"manner toward their boss, they thought a lot more of him for having done"
so.
"Next day all hands did even better, and nightfall found them at the"
"inlet of Loon Lake, with the drive before them. Bob could not understand"
it. All day he had been expecting some disagreeable happening of a
nature to retard their progress which could be laid at the door of the
trust. When it did not come he was almost disappointed. It was
impossible to believe that Crane had given up so easily; he was not that
"sort. He would explode a bombshell of some sort soon, and the longer he"
delayed the more deadly was likely to be the nature of his attack.
"However, there was nothing to be gained in discounting the future, nor"
time to spare for fretting over the unknown. Bob was far too busy during
the daylight hours even to think of Crane or his satellites. It was a
ticklish job to get the drive across even so small a body of water as
"the so-called lake, and it took one entire day and the better part of"
"another. It was done without mishap, however, and Bainbridge was just"
congratulating himself on having got safely over one of the most
disagreeable bits of the entire distance when Jerry Calker approached
him as he stood watching the last few logs bob slowly out of the lake
good--the power of that sneered-at race that is to thy silly little
individual hand’s strength as the might of the sea to the spite of some

"Yet, if the insignificance of thy little petty self irk thy conceit"
"at this moment, what of the scented, gloved, and dandified gentlemen"
who write the anarchic words that have led thy conceit to seek some
shabby fame in flinging a bomb amongst innocent people! What of them
whose lyric pens have pointed the way to the Uselessness of the old
and sick and far-too-many and superfluous ones! What of them that go
scot-free--whose philosophies led thee to kill the old miser-woman and
to slay the drunken carter to thine own Egoism’s enrichment? Tsh! thou
"wert but a tool after all, thou with all thy strange gabble of Ruthless"
"Overman, putting to the touch of practice what the gloved gentlemen"
were content to prate of--Might being Right and the rest.
"Well, thou goest to thy dunghill alone--they to their social triumphs."
"And, when all’s said, the aristocratic ideal has brought rich harvests"
as well as the shearing of necks to its idolaters--and they have had

and square to their comical little greatnesses? And multitude of
lackeys!... Gods! are they not even Envied!

Clyde--hours wherein she had come to know him more intimately and to
feel that he was growing to a truer understanding of herself. She
realized beyond all doubt that for him there was but one woman in all
"the world, yet the mere pleasure of being near him was an anodyne for"
"her secret distress. Womanlike, she took what was offered her and"
strove unceasingly for more.
"Two days after sighting _The Juliet_ they raised another ship, one of"
"the sailing fleet which they knew to be hovering in the offing, and"
then on the fifth of the month the capricious current opened a way for
them. Slowly at first they pushed on between the floes into a vast area
"of slush-ice, thence to a stretch as open and placid as a country"
"mill-pond. The lookout pointed a path out of this, into which they"
"steamed, coming at length to clear water, with the low shores of the"
mainland twenty miles away.
"At sundown they anchored in the wide estuary of the Kalvik River, the"
noisy rumble of their chains breaking the silence that for months had
lain like a smother upon the port. The Indian village gave sign of life
"only in thin, azure wisps of smoke that rose from the dirt roofs; the"
cannery buildings stood as naked and uninviting as when Boyd had last
seen them. The Greek cross crowning the little white church was gilded
by the evening sun. Through the glasses Cherry spied a figure in the
"door of her house which she declared was Constantine, but with"
commendable caution the big breed forebore to join the fleet of kyaks
"now rapidly mustering. Taking Clyde with them, she and Boyd were soon"
"on their way to the land, leaving George to begin discharging his"
cargo. The long voyage that had maddened the fishermen was at last at
"an end, and they were eager to begin their tasks."
"A three-mile pull brought the ship's boat to Cherry's landing, where"
"Constantine and Chakawana met them, the latter hysterical with joy, the"
witness the exhibition.  It was a fine stretch of ground which had been
"chosen—nearly a mile in length, and with several natural obstacles,"
"which had been increased in some cases artificially, to test better the"
strength and skill of horse and rider.  A stream of water with rather
"awkward banks ran across the course in one place, and in another was a"
dip in the ground filled with gorse bushes—a nasty place to get
"entangled in, if the horse could not be persuaded to clear the whole"
thing with a flying leap.  A broken stone wall with a ditch in front was
"another obstacle; and the last was a barrier entirely artificial, made"
"of hurdles and bushes high enough to tax the mettle of any horse, though"
"not absolutely insurmountable. Still it was a formidable object enough,"
"and Grey looked at it critically, walking Don Carlos up and down, to let"
the creature take his own observations with regard to the leap he was to
make.
"""It was here they were busy yesterday, but I could not see all they did."
I was afraid to leave Don Carlos with so many strangers about.  Some of
the grooms with the other horses looked up to mischief. But I heard them
say afterwards that Lord Sandford had not been satisfied with the field
as it was.  He said they must have something that really would be a
"test, or the black stallion and Don Carlos were like to come in"
"together."""
"But now a horn blew gaily, and horsemen were seen approaching from many"
quarters.  In the neighbourhood of the inn all was bustle and
"excitement, whilst from all sides there appeared streams of people"
converging to this spot.  Some fine carriages had been driven out from
"London, with bedecked ladies eager to witness the contest.  Others had"
stayed the night in the neighbourhood to be ready; and all the natives
"of the place who could get a holiday had come to gape at the fine folks,"
and see the grand gentlemen racing their own horses.
The Girl chided him with gentle authority.
"""You keep perfectly still--you mustn't say nothin' 'til you've rested."
"Everythin's all right an' you needn't worry a bit."" But then seeing that"
"he chafed at this, she added: ""Well, then, I'll tell you all there is to"
"know."" And then followed an account of the happenings of that night. It"
"was not a thoroughly truthful tale, for in her narrative she told him"
"only what she thought was necessary and good for him to know, keeping"
the rest to herself. And when she had related all that there was to tell
"she insisted upon his going to sleep again, giving him no opportunity"
"whatsoever to speak, since she left his bedside after drawing the"
curtains.
Unwillingly the man lay back and tried to force himself to be patient;
"but he fretted at the enforced quietude and, as a result, sleep refused"
to come to him. From time to time he could hear the Girl moving
noiselessly about the room. The knowledge that she was there gave him a
"sense of security, and he began to let his thoughts dwell upon her. No"
longer did he doubt but what she was a real influence now; and the
thought had the effect of making him keenly alive to what his life had
"been. It was not a pleasant picture that he looked back upon, now that"
he had caught a glimpse of what life might mean with the Girl at his
side. From the moment that he had taken her in his arms he realised to
"the full that his cherished dream had come true; he realised, also, that"
there was now but one answer to the question of keeping to the oath
"given to his father, and that was that gratitude--for he had guessed"
"rightly, though she had not told him, that she had saved him from"
capture by the Sheriff and his posse--demanded that he should put an end
to his vocation and devote his life henceforth to making her happy.
Once or twice while thus communing with himself he fancied that he heard
"breakfast, and were ready for the day’s work. As a matter of fact, they"
"took less time than usual, for something of Bainbridge’s intense"
eagerness for speed seemed to have made itself felt.
All morning Bob worked like a Trojan getting the drive out into the
"Katahdin River. He did not storm and swear at his men, as many bosses"
do. Instead he had a way of jollying them along in a manner which might
"sound superficially like fun, but which held more than an undercurrent"
"of seriousness. He treated them as human beings, not as if they were"
"slaves from whom every last atom of work was to be extracted. And yet,"
"when the need arose, he could hand out a rebuke, the caustic sting of"
which was enough to make a man’s hair stand on end. The result was that
"the crew soon admired him, and when they found how urgent was the need"
"for haste they fell to with a will, and gave the best that was in them."
"Bainbridge was not long in perceiving their attitude, and it gratified"
him intensely. He had never actually had charge of a drive before. He
"knew the theory, of course, but that is very different from the"
practical operation; and the discovery that he could handle a
rough-and-ready crowd like this in a manner so totally different from
that generally practiced by bosses of crews gave him no small
satisfaction.
"By dint of constant labor, at which Bob spared neither himself nor his"
"men, the drive was successfully swung into the slightly larger river by"
two o’clock. There was no real respite even then. The stream was almost
"as difficult as the Megantic, and constant watchfulness was necessary to"
prevent fresh jams at a number of points. Consequently the men snatched
a hurried dinner in relays and hustled back to work again.
"It was about three, and Bob had just left the spot where only the most"
strenuous personal labor on the part of himself and four river jacks had
"There is still much land available for cocoanut planting, though but"
"little of it is government land. Both coasts are fit for this industry,"
"unlike the banana industry, which thrives only on the Atlantic shore."
"Panama is outside of the hurricane belt, which gives an added advantage"
to the cocoanut planter. Elsewhere in the Caribbean the trees suffer
severely from the high winds.
The lumber of Panama will in time come to be one of its richest assets.
In the dense forests hardwoods of a dozen varieties or more are to be
"found, but as yet the cost of getting it out is prohibitive in most"
sections. Only those forests adjacent to streams are economically
"valuable and such activity as is shown is mainly along the Bayano,"
"Chucunaque, and Tuyra Rivers. The list of woods is almost interminable."
The prospectus of one of the companies with an extended territory on the
"Bayano River notes eighteen varieties of timber, commercially valuable"
on its territory. Among those the names of which are unfamiliar are the
"espavé (sometimes spelled espevé), the cocobolo, the espinosa cedar, the"
zoro and the sangre. All are hard woods serviceable in cabinet making.
The espavé is as hard as mahogany and of similar color and marking. The
trees will run four to five feet thick at the stump with saw timber 60
"to 70 feet in length. Espinosa trees are of the cedar type, growing to"
"enormous size, frequently exceeding 16 feet in circumference. The"
"cocobolo is a hard wood, but without the beauty to fit it for cabinet"
work. The sangre derives its name from its red sap which exudes from a
"gash like blood. It takes a high polish, and is in its general"
characteristics not unlike our cherry.
For the casual tourist the lumber district most easy of access is that
along the Bayano River reached by a motor boat or steam launch in a few
"hours from Panama. The trip is frequently made by pleasure seekers, for"
perhaps nowhere in the world is the beauty of a phosphorescent sea at
"night so marvelously shown, and few places easily found by man show such"
"for the erudite, who are few; we shall bark to stir up the people. After"
1520 he writes again and again: 'I am stoned every day'.
"But Erasmus, however much he might see himself, not without reason, at"
"the centre, could, in 1519 and 1520, no longer be blind to the fact that"
the great struggle did not concern him alone. On all sides the battle
"was being fought. What is it, that great commotion about matters of"
spirit and of faith?
The answer which Erasmus gave himself was this: it is a great and wilful
conspiracy on the part of the conservatives to suffocate good learning
and make the old ignorance triumph. This idea recurs innumerable times
"in his letters after the middle of 1518. 'I know quite certainly', he"
"writes on 21 March 1519 to one of his German friends, 'that the"
barbarians on all sides have conspired to leave no stone unturned till
they have suppressed _bonae literae_.' 'Here we are still fighting with
the protectors of the old ignorance'; cannot Wolsey persuade the Pope to
stop it here? All that appertains to ancient and cultured literature is
called 'poetry' by those narrow-minded fellows. By that word they
"indicate everything that savours of a more elegant doctrine, that is to"
"say all that they have not learned themselves. All the tumult, the whole"
tragedy--under these terms he usually refers to the great theological
struggle--originates in the hatred of _bonae literae_. 'This is the
source and hot-bed of all this tragedy; incurable hatred of linguistic
"study and the _bonae literae_.' 'Luther provokes those enemies, whom it"
"is impossible to conquer, though their cause is a bad one. And meanwhile"
"envy harasses the _bonae literae_, which are attacked at his (Luther's)"
"instigation by these gadflies. They are already nearly insufferable,"
when things do not go well with them; but who can stand them when they
"triumph? Either I am blind, or they aim at something else than Luther."
They are preparing to conquer the phalanx of the Muses.'
lined with hard-packed bumper-layers of hemp and fibre. High into the
air extended the upper half of the ship of space--a sullen gray expanse
"of fifty-inch hardened steel armor, curving smoothly upward to a needle"
prow. Countless hundred of fine vertical scratches marred every inch
"of her surface, and here and there the stubborn metal was grooved and"
scored to a depth of inches--each scratch and score the record of an
attempt of some wandering cosmic body to argue the right-of-way with
the stupendous mass of that man-made cruiser of the void.
"A burly young man made his way through the throng about the entrance,"
"nodded unconcernedly to the gatekeeper, and joined the stream of"
passengers flowing through the triple doors of the double air-lock
"and down a corridor to the center of the vessel. However, instead of"
entering one of the elevators which were whisking the passengers up to
"their staterooms in the upper half of the enormous football, he in some"
way caused an opening to appear in an apparently blank steel wall and
stepped through it into the control room.
"""Hi, Breck!"" the burly one called, as he strode up to the instrument-desk"
"of the chief pilot and tossed his bag carelessly into a corner. ""Behold"
your computer in the flesh! What's all this howl and fuss about poor
"computation?"""
"""Hello, Steve!"" The chief pilot smiled as he shook hands cordially."
"""Glad to see you again--but don't try to kid the old man. I'm simple"
"enough to believe almost anything, but some things just aren't being"
"done. We have been yelling, and yelling hard, for trained computers"
ever since they started riding us about every one centimeter change in
"acceleration, but I know that you're no more an I-P computer than I am"
"a Digger Indian. They don't shoot sparrows with coast-defense guns!"""

"who, of his own accord, does better things than human laws require? What"
arrogance it is to bind by institutions a man who is clearly led by the
inspirations of the divine spirit!
In Erasmus we already find the beginning of that optimism which judges
"upright man good enough to dispense with fixed forms and rules. As More,"
"in _Utopia_, and Rabelais, Erasmus relies already on the dictates of"
"nature, which produces man as inclined to good and which we may follow,"
provided we are imbued with faith and piety.
In this line of confidence in what is natural and desire of the simple
"and reasonable, Erasmus's educational and social ideas lie. Here he is"
far ahead of his times. It would be an attractive undertaking to discuss
Erasmus's educational ideals more fully. They foreshadow exactly those
"of the eighteenth century. The child should learn in playing, by means"
"of things that are agreeable to its mind, from pictures. Its faults"
should be gently corrected. The flogging and abusive schoolmaster is
Erasmus's abomination; the office itself is holy and venerable to him.
Education should begin from the moment of birth. Probably Erasmus
"attached too much value to classicism, here as elsewhere: his friend"
Peter Gilles should implant the rudiments of the ancient languages in
"his two-year-old son, that he may greet his father with endearing"
stammerings in Greek and Latin. But what gentleness and clear good sense
shines from all Erasmus says about instruction and education!
The same holds good of his views about marriage and woman. In the
problem of sexual relations he distinctly sides with the woman from deep
conviction. There is a great deal of tenderness and delicate feeling in
his conception of the position of the girl and the woman. Few characters
of the _Colloquies_ have been drawn with so much sympathy as the girl
with the lover and the cultured woman in the witty conversation with the
abbot. Erasmus's ideal of marriage is truly social and hygienic. Let us
"tusks. He decided therefore to arrange an uvalaku expedition, at the"
beginning of which the pig was to be killed and feasted upon and its
tusks turned into ornaments.
"When, in November, 1917, I passed through the district, the preparing"
"of the canoes was already afoot. All of those, which still could be"
"repaired, had been taken to pieces and were being relashed, recaulked"
"and repainted. In some hamlets, new dug-outs were being scooped. After"
"a few months stay in the Trobriands, I went South again in March, 1918,"
intending to spend some time in the Amphletts. Landing there is always
"difficult, as there are no anchorages near the shore, and it is quite"
impossible to disembark in rough weather at night. I arrived late in a
"small cutter, and had to cruise between Gumasila and Domdom, intending"
to wait till daybreak and then effect a landing. In the middle of
"the night, however, a violent north-westerly squall came down, and"
"making a split in the main-sail, forced us to run before the wind,"
southwards towards Dobu. It was on this night that the native boys
"employed in the boat, saw the mulukwausi flaming up at the head of"
"the mast. The wind dropped before daybreak, and we entered the Lagoon"
"of Sanaroa, in order to repair the sail. During the three days we"
"stopped there, I roamed over the country, climbing its volcanic cones,"
paddling up the creeks and visiting the villages scattered on the
coral plain. Everywhere I saw signs of the approaching departure for
"Boyowa; the natives preparing their canoes on the beach to be loaded,"
collecting food in the gardens and making sago in the jungle. At the
"head of one of the creeks, in the midst of a sago swamp, there was a"
"long, low shelter which serves as a dwelling to Dobuan natives from"
the main Island when they come to gather sago. This swamp was said
to be reserved to a certain community of Tu'utauna.
"Another day I came upon a party of local natives from Sanaroa, who"
"were pounding sago pulp out of a palm, and sluicing it with water. A"
living creatures is all his own. And here I may mention a very curious
"contrast, that whereas in India the Hindu will not take life and the"
"Mussulman will, yet the Mussulman is by reputation far kinder to his"
beasts than the Hindu. Here the Burman combines both qualities. He has
"all the kindness to animals that the Mahommedan has, and more, and he"
has the same horror of taking life that the Hindu has.
"Coming from half-starved, over-driven India, it is a revelation to see"
the animals in Burma. The village ponies and cattle and dogs in India
"are enough to make the heart bleed for their sordid misery, but in Burma"
"they are a delight to the eye. They are all fat, every one of them--fat"
and comfortable and impertinent; even the ownerless dogs are well fed. I
suppose the indifference of the ordinary native of India to animal
"suffering comes from the evil of his own lot. He is so very poor, he has"
"such hard work to find enough for himself and his children, that his"
sympathy is all used up. He has none to spare. He is driven into a dumb
"heartlessness, for I do not think he is actually cruel."
The Burman is full of the greatest sympathy towards animals of all
"kinds, of the greatest understanding of their ways, of the most"
humorously good-natured attitude towards them. Looking at them from his
"manhood, he has no contempt for them; but the gentle toleration of a"
"father to very little children who are stupid and troublesome often, but"
are very lovable. He feels himself so far above them that he can
"condescend towards them, and forbear with them."
His ponies are pictures of fatness and impertinence and go. They never
have any vice because the Burman is never cruel to them; they are never
"well trained, partly because he does not know how to train them, partly"
because they are so near the aboriginal wild pony as to be incapable of
"very much training. But they are willing; they will go for ever, and"
"are very strong, and they have admirable constitutions and tempers. You"
"""Had to stay in this last trip--been doing some work on the ether,"
"force-field theory, and other advanced stuff that I had to go to Mars"
"and Venus to get. Just got back last week. As for solving mysteries,"
"laugh while you can, old hyena. You and a lot of other dim bulbs think"
that Roeser's Rays are the last word--that there's nothing left to
discover--are going to get jarred loose from your hinges one of these
days. When I came in nine months ago they were hot on the trail of
"something big, and I'll bet they bring it in...."""
Out upon the dock an insistent siren blared a crescendo and diminuendo
"blast of sound, and two minutes remained. In every stateroom and in"
every lounge and saloon speakers sounded a warning:
"""For a short time, while we are pulling clear of the gravitational field"
"of the Earth, walking will be somewhat difficult, as everything on board"
will apparently increase in weight by about one-fifth of its present
"amount. Please remain seated, or move about with caution. In about an"
"hour weight will gradually return to normal. We start in one minute."""
"""Hipe!"" barked the chief pilot as a flaring purple light sprang into"
"being upon his board, and the assistants came to attention at their"
"stations. ""Seconds! Four! Three! Two! One! LIFT!"" He touched a"
"button and a set of plunger switches drove home, releasing into the"
forty-five enormous driving projectors the equilibrium power--the
fifteen-thousand-and-odd kilofranks of energy that exactly
counterbalanced the pull of gravity upon the mass of the cruiser.
"Simultaneously there was added from the potentiometer, already set"
"to the exact figure given by the computer, the _plus_-equilibrium"
power--which would not be changed throughout the journey if the ideal
acceleration curve were to be registered upon the recorders--and the
immense mass of the cruiser of the void wafted vertically upward at a
"low and constant velocity. The bellowing, shrieking siren had cleared"
"discord is signalled by the rattle of dice, thrown by Yudhisthira, the"
"pawn at stake, being the crown. Two hostile arrays are set in motion,"
mighty Kaurava armaments meeting in shock of battle the Pandava host
"with Arjuna as the leader, and Krishna as his Divine Charioteer. At the"
"supreme moment Arjuna had flung down his earthly weapon, Gandiva. It was"
then that the eternal conflict between matter and spirit was decided.
The next panel shows the outward or the material aspect of victory.
Behind a foreground of waving flags is seen the battle field of
Kurukshetra with procession of white-clad mourning women seen by fitful
lights of funeral pyres. In the last panel is seen Yudhisthira
renouncing the fruits of his victory setting out on his last journey. In
"front of him lies the vast and sombre plain and mountain peaks, faintly"
"visible by gleams of unearthly light, unlocalised but playing here and"
there. His wife and his brothers had fallen behind and dropped one by
one. There is to be no human companion in his last journey. The only
thing that stood by him and from which he had never been really
separated is Dharma or the Spirit of Righteousness.
LIFE OF ACTION
Faridpur at that time enjoyed a notoriety of being the stronghold of
"desperate characters, dacoits by land and water. My father had captured"
"single-handed one of the principal leaders, whom he sentenced to a long"
term of imprisonment. After release he came to my father and demanded
"some occupation, since the particular vocation in which he had"
specialised was now rendered impossible. My father took the unusual
"course to employ him as my special attendant to carry me, a child of"
"four, on his back to the distant village school. No nurse could be"
"tenderer than this ex-leader of lawless men, whose profession had been"
to deal out wounds and deaths. He had accepted a life of peace but he
could not altogether wipe out his old memories. He used to fill my
The very question sobered him.
Suddenly it was as though he had left the din of the noisy thoroughfare
of life and had entered the majestic silence of a mighty cathedral;
"and from the great mysterious deeps a whisper came to his ears, each"
"syllable roundly phrased, clear, unhesitating, a chapter of this"
strange book of life that he had so lately read--the book that had
fired his blood and aroused his energy. The breath of these pages
"seemed to give him decision and free air, where before he had been"
"drifting aimlessly, going he knew not whither, caring not overmuch."
This book had braced him--it was a call to battle. He had had enough of
beds of roses and daffodils and idyllic trances. The phrasing of _The
Masterfolk_ came to him now:
“Nature has ordered that certain things shall be; and to him who
disobeys her ordering she is cruelly merciless. She has decreed that
"he shall be most dominant, shall breed the fittest race, shall know"
"the fullest life, shall achieve the highest destiny, who abides"
by the woman he loves. And him who is unclean she flings upon the
"dunghill--him and his seed for ever. Of the love of man for woman,"
Nature has spoken with no uncertain voice; and Nature’s judgment is
final. He that fears to love a woman sets himself against the supreme
law of life; he ends in unnatural vice; he is against the design of
life; celibacy Nature will none of--for celibacy stultifies life and
ends the race. Promiscuous love she condemns utterly and punishes
heavily with loathsome disease and with foul decay; the races of
"promiscuous love are become of the scum of the earth, and are dying"
"out. Against the love of many women also, once and for all, she"
has spoken. The peoples of many wives Nature is sweeping into the
waste corners of the world. Nature is her own jury--Nature alone her
own judge. She hath not said the Masterfolk cannot break from her
"most part submissive; and _if they were not_, the arm of the Church was"
very long and her grasp mortal.... They [the thinkers] could have taught
"Europe _earlier than the Church allowed it to learn_, that the sun does"
"not go round the earth, and that it is the earth which goes round the"
sun.... After the middle of the last century the insurrection against
the pretensions of the Church and against the doctrines of Christianity
"was marked in one of its most important phases by a new, and most"
"significant, feature.... It was an advance both in knowledge and"
in moral motive.... The philosophical movement was represented by
"""Diderot"" [leading the Encyclopaedist circle.]... Broadly stated the"
"great central moral of it was this: that human nature is good, that the"
"world is capable of being made a desirable abiding-place, and that the"
evil of the world _is the fruit of bad education and bad institutions_.
This cheerful doctrine now strikes on the ear as a commonplace and a
"truism. A hundred years ago in France it was a wonderful gospel, _and"
the beginning of a new dispensation.... Into what fresh and unwelcome
sunlight it brought the articles of the old theology... Every social
improvement since has been the outcome of that new doctrine in one form
or another_.... The teaching of the Church paints men as fallen and
depraved. The deadly chagrin with which churchmen saw the new fabric
rising was very natural.... The new secular knowledge clashed at
"a thousand points, alike in letter and spirit, with the old sacred"
"lore.... A hundred years ago this perception was vague and indefinite,"
but there was an unmistakable apprehension that _the Catholic ideal
"of womanhood_ was no more adequate to the facts of life, than Catholic"
"views about science, or popery, or labor, or political order and"
"authority.""--Morley."
"And it took the rising infidels to discover the fact. See Morley,"
"""Diderot,"" p. 76."

"But the greatest place for Nats is the Popa Mountain, which is an"
extinct volcano standing all alone about midway between the river and
"the Shan Mountains. It is thus very conspicuous, having no hills near it"
"to share its majesty; and being in sight from many of the old capitals,"
it is very well known in history and legend. It is covered with dense
"forest, and the villages close about are few. At the top there is a"
"crater with a broken side, and a stream comes flowing out of this break"
"down the mountain. Probably it was the denseness of its forests, the"
"abundance of water, and its central position, more than its guardian"
"Nats, that made it for so many years the last retreating-place of the"
"half-robber, half-patriot bands that made life so uneasy for us. But the"
Nats of Popa Mountains are very famous.
When any foreigner was taken into the service of the King of Burma he
"had to swear an oath of fidelity. He swore upon many things, and among"
them were included 'all the Nats in Popa.' No Burman would have dared to
"break an oath sworn in such a serious way as this, and they did not"
imagine that anyone else would. It was and is a very dangerous thing to
"offend the Popa Nats; for they are still there in the mountain, and"
everyone who goes there must do them reverence.
"A friend of mine, a police officer, who was engaged in trying to catch"
"the last of the robber chiefs who hid near Popa, told me that when he"
"went up the mountain shooting he, too, had to make offerings. Some way"
"up there is a little valley dark with overhanging trees, and a stream"
"flows slowly along it. It is an enchanted valley, and if you look"
"closely you will see that the stream is not as other streams, for it"
flows uphill. It comes rushing into the valley with a great display of
"foam and froth, and it leaves in a similar way, tearing down the rocks,"
and behaving like any other boisterous hill rivulet; but in the valley
as an armed force ready to fight for the right of passage. In 1786 the
"Spaniards sought to subdue the territory, built forts on both the"
Atlantic and Pacific coasts and established a line of trading posts
connecting them. But the effort failed. The posts were abandoned. Today
the white man who tries to enter the Darien does so at the risk of his
life.
"In 1854 a navy exploring expedition of twenty-seven men, under command"
"of Lieutenant Isaac C. Strain, entered the jungle of the Darien at"
"Caledonia Bay, on the Atlantic side, the site of Patterson’s ill-fated"
colony. They purposed crossing the Isthmus and making a survey for a
"canal route, as an English adventurer not long before had"
asserted--falsely as it proved--that he had discovered a route by which
a canal could be built with but three or four miles of cutting. The
party carried ten days’ provisions and forty rounds of ball cartridge
"per man. They expected to have to traverse about forty or fifty miles,"
for which the supply of provisions seemed wholly adequate. But when
"they had cut their way through the jungle, waded through swamps and"
climbed hills until their muscles were exhausted and their clothing torn
"to tatters, they found themselves lost in the very interior of the"
Isthmus with all their food gone. Diaries kept by members of the party
show that they lived in constant terror of the Indians. But no attack
was made upon them. The inhabitants contented themselves with
"disappearing before the white men’s advance, sweeping their huts and"
fields clear of any sort of food. The jungle not its people fought the
invaders. For food they had mainly nuts with a few birds and the diet
"disturbed their stomachs, caused sores and loosened their teeth. The"
"bite of a certain insect deposited under the skin a kind of larva, or"
"worm, which grew to the length of an inch and caused the most frightful"
"torments. Despairing of getting his full party out alive, after they had"
"been twenty-three days fighting with the jungle, Strain took three men"
and pushed ahead to secure and send back relief. It was thirty-nine days
Indeed the hour for the contest had well-nigh come.  Grey could see that
"the other horses were assembling, their riders decked in every colour of"
"the rainbow, quite eclipsing the quiet and workmanlike suit of buff"
which he wore.  But Grey’s taste had always disinclined him to gaudy
"colours.  The soft leather, finely chased and stamped in gold, pleased"
his eye more than rich-hued cloths or velvets.  His breeches were of
"white buckskin cut by Lord Sandford’s own tailor, and he wore long boots"
"fitted with silver spurs, albeit he scarcely ever had need of the latter"
when he bestrode Don Carlos.  His scarf was of white silk fringed with
"gold, and his only adornment was a cravat of fine lace, fastened with a"
"diamond clasp.  His cocked hat matched his buff coat, and was adorned"
"with a white plume.  Altogether, as he rode forward to his place, it"
would have been hard to find a fault with his dress or person; and the
"ladies behind their fans audibly praised his elegant figure, graceful"
"seat, and distinguished and handsome face."
"Grey, all unconscious of the favour bestowed upon him, rode up and"
saluted courteously the gentlemen who were to meet him and each other in
"rivalry. Lord Sandford, splendidly mounted, was to act as judge at the"
winning post.  Another of his friends was to be starter; and gentlemen
were posted at various points along the course to see that all the rules
"laid down were observed, and that no rider deviated from the"
well-pegged-out route prescribed for all.  The spectators scattered
"hither and thither, taking up stations wherever their fancy prompted."
The course seemed marked out by a glittering border extending down both
"sides.  The sun shone brilliantly in the sky, and all nature seemed in"
gladsome mood.
Grey cast a keen look at the seven rival steeds as they were brought
into line for the start.  He picked out in a moment the two of whom
"Dicon had spoken, and saw that he had judged well.  Then he gave his"
"whole mind to the task in hand, checked with hand and voice the prancing"
He has made out of the teaching a new teaching that is very far from
"that of the Buddha, and the teaching is this: When a man dies his soul"
"remains, his 'I' has only changed its habitation. Still it lives and"
"breathes on earth, not the effect, but the soul itself. It is reborn"
"among us, and it may even be recognised very often in its new abode."
"And that we should never forget this, that we should never doubt that"
"this is true, it has been so ordered that many can remember something of"
these former lives of theirs. This belief is not to a Burman a mere
"theory, but is as true as anything he can see. For does he not daily see"
"people who know of their former lives? Nay, does he not himself, often"
"vaguely, have glimpses of that former life of his? No man seems to be"
"quite without it, but of course it is clearer to some than others. Just"
"as we tell stories in the dusk of ghosts and second sight, so do they,"
"when the day's work is over, gossip of stories of second birth; only"
that they believe in them far more than we do in ghosts.
A friend of mine put up for the night once at a monastery far away in
the forest near a small village. He was travelling with an escort of
"mounted police, and there was no place else to sleep but in the"
"monastery. The monk was, as usual, hospitable, and put what he had, bare"
"house-room, at the officer's disposal, and he and his men settled down"
for the night.
"After dinner a fire was built on the ground, and the officer went and"
sat by it and talked to the headman of the village and the monk. First
"they talked of the dacoits and of crops, unfailing subjects of interest,"
and gradually they drifted from one subject to another till the
"Englishman remarked about the monastery, that it was a very large and"
fine one for such a small secluded village to have built. The monastery
"was of the best and straightest teak, and must, he thought, have taken a"
"very long time and a great deal of labour to build, for the teak must"
"Many canoes were anchored along the coast beyond the village beach,"
"some tucked away into small coves, others moored in sheltered"
"shallows. The men sat on the shore round fires, preparing their food,"
which they took out of the provisions carried on the canoes. Only the
"water did they obtain from the island, filling their coco-nut-made"
water vessels from the springs. About a dozen canoes were actually
"moored at the village beach. Late at night, I walked along the shore"
"to observe their sleeping arrangements. In the clear, moonlit night,"
"the small fires burnt with a red, subdued glow; there was always one"
"of them between each two sleepers, consisting of three burning sticks,"
"gradually pushed in as they were consumed. The men slept with the big,"
"stiff pandanus mats over them; each mat is folded in the middle, and"
"when put on the ground, forms a kind of miniature prismatic tent. All"
"along the beach, it was almost a continuous row of man alternating with"
"fire, the dun-coloured mats being nearly invisible against the sand in"
the full moonlight. It must have been a very light sleep for every now
"and then, a man stirred, peeping up from under his shell, re-adjusting"
"the fire, and casting a searching glance over the surroundings. It"
would be difficult to say whether mosquitoes or cold wind or fear of
"sorcery disturbed their sleep most, but I should say the last."
"The next morning, early, and without any warning, the whole fleet"
sailed away. At about 8 o'clock the last canoe punted towards the
"offing, where they stepped their mast and hoisted their sail. There"
"were no farewell gifts, no conch shell blowing, and the Dobuans this"
"time left their resting place as they had come, without ceremony or"
"display. The morning after, the Nabwagetans followed them. I was left"
"in the village with a few cripples, the women and one or two men who"
"had remained perhaps to look after the village, perhaps specially to"
keep watch over me and see that I did no mischief. Not one of them was
"a good informant. Through a mistake of mine, I had missed the cutter"
which had come two days before to the island of Gumasila and left
In their present state the San Blas are relatively rich. All the land
belongs to all the people--that is why the old chief declined to sell
the sandy beach. There is a sort of private property in improvements. A
"banana plantation, a cocoanut grove or an orange tree planted and cared"
"for, becomes a positive possession handed down to descendants of the"
owner through the female line. Perhaps one reason for keeping the women
so shut off from the world is that they are the real owners of all
"individual property. Ownership does not, however, attach to trees or"
plants growing wild; they are as much communal as the land. So the
"vegetable ivory, balata and cocoanuts which form the marketable products"
are gathered by whomsoever may take the trouble. Land that has been
tilled belongs to the one who improved it. If he let it lapse into
wilderness it reverts to the community. The San Blas Indians have the
essence of the single tax theory without the tax.
"They have a hazily defined religious system, and have curiously reversed"
the position held by their priests or sorcerers. These influential
"persons are not representatives of the spirit of good, but of the bad"
spirit. Very logically the San Blas savages hold that any one may
"represent the good spirit by being himself good, and that the"
unsupported prayers of such a one are sure to be heard. But to reach the
"devil, to induce that malicious practitioner of evil to rest from his"
"persecutions and to abandon the pursuit of the unfortunate, it is"
desirable to have as intermediary some one who possesses his confidence
and high regard. Hence the strong position of the sorcerers in the
villages. The people defer to them on the principle that it is well to
make friends with “the Mammon of Unrighteousness”.
"Polygamy is permitted among these Indians, but little practiced. Even"
the chiefs whose high estate gives them the right to more than one wife
"seldom avail themselves of the privilege. The women, as in most"
"primitive tribes, are the hewers of wood and drawers of water. Dress is"
The opinion was universal. The Burmans preferred to spend twice or
"thrice the money and hire a bullock-cart and go slowly, while the coach"
"flashed past them in a whirl of dust, or they preferred to walk. Many"
and many times have I seen the roadside rest-houses full of travellers
halting for a few minutes' rest. They walked while the coach came by
empty; and nearly all of them could have afforded the fare. It was a
"very striking instance of what pure kind-heartedness will do, for there"
would have been no religious command broken by going in the coach. It
was the pure influence of compassion towards the beasts and refusal to
"be a party to such hard-heartedness. And yet, as I have said, I do not"
think the law could have interfered with success. Surely a people who
"could act like this have the very soul of religion in their hearts,"
although the act was not done in the name of religion.
"All the animals--the cattle, the ponies, and the buffaloes--are so tame"
that it is almost an unknown thing for anyone to get hurt.
The cattle are sometimes afraid of the white face and strange attire of
"a European, but you can walk through the herds as they come home in the"
evening with perfect confidence that they will not hurt you. Even a cow
with a young calf will only eye you suspiciously; and with the Burmans
even the huge water buffaloes are absolutely tame. You can see a herd of
"these great beasts, with horns six feet across, come along under the"
command of a very small boy or girl perched on one of their broad backs.
"He flourishes a little stick, and issues his commands like a general. It"
is one of the quaintest imaginable sights to see this little fellow get
"off his steed, run after a straggler, and beat him with his stick. The"
"buffalo eyes his master, whom he could abolish with one shake of his"
"head, submissively, and takes the beating, which he probably feels about"
"as much as if a straw fell on him, good-humouredly. The children never"
"seem to come to grief. Buffaloes occasionally charge Europeans, but the"
only place where I have known of Burmans being killed by buffaloes is in
"rushed past him--man or animal he could not tell which, for its feet"
"made no more sound upon the floor than those of a wolf-dog. Then, as he"
"bolted forward, he heard a man cry out, and found himself in the midst"
"of turmoil. His hands encountered a human body, and he seized it, only"
to be hurled aside as if with a giant's strength. Again he clinched
"with a man's form, and bore it to the floor, cursing at the darkness"
and reaching for its throat. His antagonist raised his voice in wild
"clamor, while Boyd braced himself for another assault from those huge"
"hands he had met a moment before. But it did not come. Instead, he"
"heard a cry from the woman, an answer in a deeper voice, and then"
"swift, pattering footsteps growing fainter. Meanwhile the man with whom"
"he was locked was fighting desperately, with hands and feet and teeth,"
"shouting hoarsely. Other footsteps sounded now, this time approaching,"
then at the door a lantern flared. A watchman came running down between
"the lines of machinery, followed by other figures half revealed."
Boyd had pinned his antagonist against the cold sides of a retort at
"last, and with fingers clutched about his throat was beating his head"
"violently against the iron, when by the lantern's gleam he caught one"
"glimpse of the fat, purple face in front of him, and loosed his hold"
with a startled exclamation. Released from the grip that had nearly
"made an end of him, Willis Marsh staggered to his feet, then lurched"
"forward as if about to fall from weakness. His eyes were staring, his"
"blackened tongue protruded, while his head, battered and bleeding,"
lolled grotesquely from side to side as if in hideous merriment. His
"clothes were torn and soiled from the litter underfoot, and he"
presented a frightful picture of distress. But it was not this that
"caused Emerson the greatest astonishment. The man was wounded, badly"

"Boyd cast his eyes about for the other participants in the encounter,"
but they were nowhere visible; only an open door in the shadows close

got to have the third place almost solid if we expect to get a smooth
curve. A hundredth of a centimeter of acceleration means a lot on a long
trip when they're holding us as close as they are doing now. We'll ride
"this trip on 981.286 centimeters--with our scheduled mass, that means"
thirty six points of four seven kilofranks _plus_ equilibrium power. All
"set to go,"" the computer stated, as he changed, by fractions of arc, the"
course-plotters of the automatic integrating goniometer.
"""You're the doctor--but I'm glad it's you that'll have to explain to the"
"observatory,"" and Breckenridge set his exceedingly delicate excess power"
"potentiometer exactly upon the indicated figure. ""Well, we've got a few"
"minutes left for a chin-chin before we lift her off."""
"""What's all this commotion about? Dish out the low-down."""
"""Well, it's like this, Steve. We pilots are having one sweet"
time--we're being growled at on every trip. The management squawks if
"we're thirty seconds plus or minus at the terminals, and the passenger"
department squalls if we change acceleration five centimeters total en
route--claims it upsets the dainty customers and loses business for
the road. They're tightening up on us all the time. A couple of years
"ago, you remember, it didn't make any difference what we did with the"
acceleration as long as we checked in somewhere near zero time--we used
to spin 'em dizzy when we reversed at the half-way station--but that
kind of stuff doesn't go any more. We've got to hold the acceleration
"constant and close to normal, got to hold our schedule on zero, _plus_"
"or _minus_ ten seconds, and yet we've got to make any detours they"
"tell us to, such as this seven-million kilometer thing they handed"
"us just now. To make things worse, we've got to take orders at every"
"check-station, and yet _we_ get the blame for everything that happens"
"as a consequence of obeying those orders! Of course, I know as well"
as you do that it's rotten technique to change acceleration at every
a naked woman entered the room. Her loveliness was extreme; her form was
"perfectly rounded, but without suggestion of voluptuousness, though she"
"was not an animated statue, but had all the characters of humanity; she"
"walked with undulating thighs, head slightly drooping, and hair falling"
down and framing a face that expressed wonderful spiritual beauty and
"innocence. The lecturer led her round, saying, ""This is beauty; now, if"
"you can look at this and be ashamed----"" and he waved his arm. She went"
"away, and a beautiful Apollo-like youth, slender but athletic, entered the"
"room, also completely naked. He walked round the room alone, with an air"
"of majestic virility. I applauded, clapping my hands, but a shiver went"
"through the ladies present; their skin became like goose-flesh, and their"
lips quivered with horror as though they were about to be outraged. The
"youth went out, and the lecturer continued. At the climax of his oratory,"
"the Apollo-like youth entered, dressed as a common soldier, with no"
"appearance of beauty, and in a rough tone said: ""'Ere! I want a shilling"
"for this job."" (And I sighed to myself: ""It is always so."") No one had a"
"shilling, and the lecturer proceeded to explain to the man that what he"
"had done was for the sake of art and beauty, and for the moral good of"
"the world. ""What do I care for that?"" he returned, ""I want a drink."" Then"
"a lady among the audience produced a collar, wrote on it a testimonial"
expressing the gratitude of those present for the man's services on this
"occasion, and handed it to me to present to him. ""Damn it,"" he said, ""this"
"is only worth twopence halfpenny; I want my shilling!"" Then I awoke.'"
The idea of murder with which this dream began seems to suggest that it
may have had its origin in some slight visceral disturbance of which
"the subject was unconscious, but nothing had occurred to suggest the"
details of the episode. The interesting feature about it is the presence
throughout of moral notions and sentiments substantially true to the
dreamer's waking ideas.
In another dream of the same dreamer's the sense of responsibility is
"clearly present: 'Mrs. F. and Miss R. had called to see me, and I was"
"spread infection, he thinks. Erasmus had, earlier than most people,"
antiseptic ideas about the danger of infection in the foul air of
"crowded inns, in the breath of confessants, in baptismal water. Throw"
"aside common cups, he pleaded; let everybody shave himself, let us be"
"cleanly as to bed-sheets, let us not kiss each other by way of greeting."
"The fear of the horrible venereal disease, imported into Europe during"
"his lifetime, and of which Erasmus watched the unbridled propagation"
"with solicitude, increases his desire for purity. Too little is being"
"done to stop it, he thinks. He cautions against suspected inns; he wants"
to have measures taken against the marriages of syphilitic persons. In
his undignified attitude towards Hutten his physical and moral aversion
to the man's evil plays an unmistakable part.
Erasmus is a delicate soul in all his fibres. His body forces him to be
"that. He is highly sensitive, among other things very susceptible to"
"cold, 'the scholars' disorder', as he calls it. Early in life already"
"the painful malady of the stone begins to torment him, which he resisted"
so bravely when his work was at stake. He always speaks in a coddling
"tone about his little body, which cannot stand fasting, which must be"
"kept fit by some exercise, namely riding, and for which he carefully"
tries to select a suitable climate. He is at times circumstantial in the
description of his ailments.[15] He has to be very careful in the matter
"of his sleep; if once he wakes up, he finds it difficult to go to sleep"
"again, and because of that has often to lose the morning, the best time"
"to work and which is so dear to him. He cannot stand cold, wind and fog,"
"but still less overheated rooms. How he has execrated the German stoves,"
which are burned nearly all the year through and made Germany almost
unbearable to him! Of his fear of illness we have spoken above. It is
not only the plague which he flees--for fear of catching cold he gives
"up a journey from Louvain to Antwerp, where his friend Peter Gilles is"
in mourning. Although he realizes quite well that 'often a great deal of
"the disease is in the imagination', yet his own imagination leaves him"
act up to it! It seems to them the necessary corollary of strength that
the strong man should be sympathetic and kind. It seems to them an
"unconscious confession of weakness to be scornful, revengeful,"
"inconsiderate. Courtesy, they say, is the mark of a great man,"
discourtesy of a little one. No one who feels his position secure will
"lose his temper, will persecute, will be disdainful. Their word for a"
fool and for a hasty-tempered man is the same. To them it is the same
"thing, one infers the other. And so their attitude towards animals is"
but an example of their attitude to each other. That an animal or a man
should be lower and weaker than you is the strongest claim he can have
"on your humanity, and your courtesy and consideration for him is the"
clearest proof of your own superiority. And so in his dealings with
"animals the Buddhist considers himself, consults his own dignity, his"
"own strength, and is kind and compassionate to them out of the greatness"
of his own heart. Nothing is more beautiful than the Burman in his ways
"with his children, and his beasts, with all who are lesser than himself."
"Even to us, who think so very differently from him on many points, there"
"is a great and abiding charm in all this, to which we can find only one"
"exception; for to our ideas there is one exception, and it is this: No"
"Burman will take any life if he can help it, and therefore, if any"
"animal injure itself, he will not kill it--not even to put it out of its"
"pain, as we say. I have seen bullocks split on slippery roads, I have"
"seen ponies with broken legs, I have seen goats with terrible wounds"
"caused by accidental falls, and no one would kill them. If, when you are"
"out shooting, your beaters pick up a wounded hare or partridge, do not"
"suppose that they wring its neck; you must yourself do that, or it will"
linger on till you get home. Under no circumstances will they take the
"life even of a wounded beast. And if you ask them, they will say: 'If a"
"man be sick, do you shoot him? If he injure his spine so that he will be"
"a cripple for life, do you put him out of his pain?'"
"still a great and mighty future before us, a future that will justify"
"our ancestry. In talking about ancestry, do we ever realise that the"
only way in which we can do honour to our past is not to boast of what
our ancestors have done but to carry out in the future something as
"great, if not greater than they. Are we to be a living nation, to be"
proud of our ancestry and to try to win renown by continuous
achievements? These mighty monuments that I see around me tell us what
has been done till very recent times. I have travelled over some of the
greatest ruins of the Universities of India. I have been to the ruins of
the University of Taxilla in the farthest corner of India which
attracted the people of the west and the east. I had been to the ruins
"of Nalanda, a University which invited all the west to gain knowledge"
under its intellectual fostering. I had been all there and seen them. I
have come here also and want to visit Conjeevaram. But are you to foster
the dead honours or to try to bring back your University in India and
drag once more from the rest of the world people who would come down and
derive knowledge from India? It is in that way and that way alone we can
win our self-respect and make our life and the life of the nation
worthy. The present era is the era of temples of learning. In order to
erect temples of learning we require all the offerings of our mighty
"people. We want to erect temples and ""viharas"" which are so"
indispensable to the study of nature and her secrets. It is a problem
which appeals to every thoughtful Indian. It is by the effort of the
people and by their generosity that all these mighty temples arose; and
now are we to worship the dead stones or are we to erect living temples
so that the knowledge that has been made in India shall be perpetuated
in India? I received requests from the different Universities in America
and Germany to allow students from those countries to come and learn the
"science that has been initiated in India. Now, is this knowledge to pass"
beyond our boundaries to that again in future time we may have to go to
the west to get back this knowledge or are we to keep this flame of
learning burning all the time?
"his mother, to the very woman who has murdered him, may, for the moment,"
bring tears to the eyes. But it is an accidental touch. The tragedy lies
not there but in the great fact that with him dies the last heir to the
"throne, the last hope of avoiding the miseries of a disputed succession;"
"and that in her revengeful fury the queen, as a woman, has committed the"
"blackest of all crimes, a mother's slaughter of her child. We are not"
asked to weep but to gasp at the horror of it. It is in order to protect
"the loftier, broader aspects of the catastrophe from the influence of"
the particular that action is excluded. This cautions us against
confusing tragedy and pathos. To perceive the difference is to recognize
that English Tragedy really begins with _Gorboduc_. Until its advent the
stress laid on the pathetic partially obscured the tragic. This may be
"seen at once in the Miracles, though a little thought will reveal the"
intensely tragic nature of the complete Miracle Play. In _Cambyses_ we
find the same obscuration: there is tragedy in the sudden ending of
"those young lives, but the pathos of the mother's anguish and the sweet"
girl's pleadings prevent us from thinking of it. _Appius and Virginia_
"maintains a much truer tragic detachment, the effect being heightened by"
its opening picture of virtuous happiness destined to abrupt and
"tyrannous ruin. But it expresses itself so ill, shatters our hearing so"
"unmercifully with its alliterative mouthing, and hurls us down so"
"steeply with its low comedy, that we refuse to give its characters the"
grandeur or excellence claimed for them by the author. _Gorboduc_ alone
presents tragedy unspoiled by extraneous additions. In its triple
"catastrophe of princes, crown and realm we perceive the awful figure of"
the Tragic Muse and shrink back in reverent fear of what more may lie
"hid from us in the folds of her black robe. Darker, much darker and more"
terrible things have come since from that gloomy spirit. What has been
written here should not be misinterpreted as an exaggerated appreciation
of _Gorboduc_. We wish only to insist that this play did give to English
"drama for the first time (if we exclude translations) an example,"
"however weak in execution, of pure tragedy; and was able to do so"

Please let her go!
Priya...
"You, are one sneaky lady."
"A small, loveable vampire."
"You are a feisty flood, in a body that is opaque like glass."
"You, are one sneaky lady."
"A small, loveable vampire."
"You are a brilliant player, who plays very casually."
"Oh, you..."
"Smart, sneaky girl!"
"Oh, you..."
"Smart, sneaky girl!"
"Oh, you..."
"Smart, sneaky girl!"
Leave.
Leave that.
Do you love her very much?
It is said 'Love is blind.'
"She looted us all, taking advantage of that."
Don't get fooled by such women.
Tie it properly...
What are you doing?
"By deceiving visually challenged people with love,"
Fat Pig swallowed my 'Beast'!
Fat Pig again?
Why would the Emperor find this so important?
I'd better cable Tokyo tomorrow.
And have somebody come pick this up.
Usually the safest place is the most dangerous.
"And the most dangerous place, the safest!"
Who's that?
Did you see someone go past?
Who was it?
- Where is her?
- Chase... I've forgotten you're dumb!
Use your imagination...!
Charade?
Great!
3 words!
The first word...!
An old woman?
A bitch?
Gallstone?
Boobs?
No boobs?
A woman?
Can't be that simple.
"Since you're so smart, clean up the toilet tomorrow then."
The second word...!
A stripteaser?
A female hen?
Get off.
You thief!
A woman thief?
This house will be put under strict security.
Batting cage.
I'm just throwing those two
Words out.
"If we get a batting cage, we win"
The department softball
Tournament every goddamn summer.
I guarantee it.
"Yeah, we need music."
I need a bra.
"Hey, how about a couple new"
Halligans and maybe that new saw
We were all bitchin' about the

Last week?
"I feel like a million bucks,"
Man.
Thanks for that ibuprofen.
"That stuff's like a wonder drug,"
You know?
They should make you take it
Every morning.
"Vitamin I. Half an hour ago,"
I couldn't
Walk now I feel fantastic.
"Hey, Jesus."
Look at all this money.
How much is that?
2 grand.
Know what we should get?
A batting cage.
Shoot me.
"Well, come on."
Yes.
"Hey, would you like to hear about Jesus Christ?"
Here you go.
Would you like to hear
"Excuse me, would you like to hear about Jesus Christ today?"
Like to hear about Jesus Christ?
- Okay.
"- Thank you very much, sir."
Would you like to hear about Jesus Christ?
Have a great day.
Would you like to hear about Jesus Christ today?
But what made him come back?
Won't you answer?
Nathan?

It doesn't recover.
We're dropping the...

"Of the 45 passengers on board, nine belonged to the same family."
All from Haiti.
So?
So they're afraid of getting fucked over by the Warsaw Convention.
"I explained to them that doesn't exist here, but they're scared, even still."
They set up a committee.
"And don't forget to keep in touch, ok?"
"Ok, out."
"Now, Judy, we've got work to do."
"You get Clarence, and we're gonna join in the search."
Go on.
"No, Toto, I'm sorry."
You're gonna have to stay home.
You're too small to take out into the bush.
"Anyway, I can't look after you."
"As a matter of fact,"
"I need Clarence and Judy to look after me, so you stay here, ok?"

"Do you see anything, Judy?"
(CHATTERING)
(CHATTERING)
"Ok, Judy."
I guess she's not around here.
Why don't you take a look over there?
I'll stay here with Clarence.
"And remember, if you find Sally, be gentle with her."
Dad says she's a very important chimp.
Now go on.

DUD:
Not very.
DETECTIVE:
So how did you ID this Ray Malcolm?
DUD:
Neighborhood snoop across the street recognized Ray's car parked out front.
Did they see him?
"Mmm-mmm, but she did see a black guy with glasses come out a little while later, get in Ray's car, and split."
"She didn't even know Ray's last name, but she thought he was staying a couple blocks away with some dopers, so we checked it out."
Can you separate it?
Mmm-mmm.
Not yet.
That Ray's package?
So who's this black guy?
"They call him ""Pluto."""
"Evidently, he's been hanging with Ray for the last couple of weeks."
They say he's from out of town.
Pluto.
That's it?
For now.
So who's the girl?
Fantasia.
Bullshit.
Good-looking.
Ray's old lady.
Here...

Last week I told you my hairdresser said I had a big forehead.
"You said it was fine, but you were lying, weren't you?"
"To protect you, yes."
[Man chattering on t.V.]
"Hey, fellas."
Could I speak to Arthur in private?
He's for safety!
That's all.

"Oh, my."
"Hey, deac, question for you."
Yeah.
"You ever feel bad about yourself so you tell Kelly there are things wrong with her just to, you know, hurt her?"
You're asking me if I mentally abuse my wife?
Yeah.
"No, I don't."
Me neither.
Wait.
"Foon, that painted face did it."
That clown again?
The opera troupe might be involved.
I thought so!
You stay out of this!
"Marshal, if you need any help, just ask."
No need.
I'm the Marshal of seven provinces!
"When I'm on a case, I can withstand anything!"
"Reporting for duty, Marshal!"
I've arrested all the painted faces.
But I don't know who's the murderer.
Quiet!
Reporting for duty!
Who's the murderer?
Reporting for duty!
"Marshal, you've made a mistake!"
I've got to go on stage any time now!
- Snake Tongue!
- Here!
Are all the painted faces here?
Yes.
We got everyone.
What about him?
- He escaped.
- Numbskull!

They got your commercial on TV up in Indian Ridge.
"It's 4:00 in the morning, but it's TV nonetheless."
You trick-or-treating?
Was wondering if you knew anything about Ken Mersey going missing.
"Yeah, what kind of trouble he got?"
"The considerable kind, I guess."
Ooh.
"Really taking yourself seriously in that uniform, ain't you?"
Don't mind going after an old drinking buddy like that?
"As far as I can see, he's under arrest."
If he's still alive.
How do you take your coffee?
I don't.
Well...
No sales being had.
No maintenance or repairs being had.
It's just a whole lot of nothing.
I haven't had a real need for Ken in the garage.
- What about the stolen truck?
- Trucks.
He took them with.
He didn't say anything.
He just... went.
That don't sound like him.
That's very interesting.
Doesn't somebody get intelligent and realize children must grow up their own way?
The mind's nothing to do with it.
It's your feelings.
Kids get born and you just worry about them and you hope for them.
"Well, I gotta get going."
"- Good night, Nellie."
"- Good night, Allison."
Hello?
"Oh, hello, Mother."
I've been thinking it over.
You can invite anyone you want to your party.
"Oh, Mother, thank you."
Thank you very much.
I'll be home in a little while.
Bye.
"2676J, please."
"Hey, watch where you're going there, buddy, will you?"
- Thanks much.
- Thank you.
- I want it.
- You don't need any.
I want some!
"- Would you like a sandwich, Norman?"
"- No, thank you."
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!
- How are you?
- How are you?
- Betty and Rodney.
"L""m damn blissful."
"Pete is happy, Joan."
He loves you.
The two are completely separate issues.
My PI was right.
Marriage is a big sham.
- How old is she?
- Twenty-two.
"She""s the towel girl at the 24 Hour Fitness."
"For weeks, Pete was complaining:"
"""Why aren""t our towels as white as the towels at the gym?"""
"And then one day, not another word about towels."
"That""s when I knew."
- I guess I have to leave him.
- I would.
- No way.
- Brenda.
"You""ll just have to win him back."
"Women""s Club."
Same time every Tuesday.
When was the last time you and Pete had a date?
"We went to Tiffany""s soccer game on Friday night."
"A date, Joan."
"High heels, tight skirt, pretending to be the maid?"
"Joan is a grownup, not a Barbie doll."
She has real-life responsibilities.
- Pete needs to suck it up and be a man.
- Says a woman twice divorced.
"Look, Joan, is Pete being a prepubescent jerk?"
Yes.
"He""s a man in his 40s."
What do you expect?
That's not really an answer.
I totally thought I was being abducted.
"I was so happy to wake up in my bunker and not some alien mother ship, but also, same time, a little bummed it didn't happen."
"I, uh..."
I need a minute with Oleg.
That's fine with me.
How's everybody doing?
Good?

At ease.
"Uh, he's got it under control."
"I'm pretty sure, okay?"

You get it?
Yeah.
Great.

Let's say 'tell'.

It's a great sauce.
This is mayonnaise.
This is vinaigrette with...

Do you want to taste it?
I?
Mr. Lloyd?
What's up?
OMG.
The Turkish security officer.
Jesus Christ.
I think he would have accompanied us to Sofia's embassy.
Absolutely not.
The escape of the king would be a humiliation for the Turks.
It could cause a diplomatic incident.
Bulut would bring us back to Istanbul to overthrow the scandal.
Let's go home.
In ambulance.
"Ludovic, we have to stop shooting right away."

I have an offer...
Zero.
You say island white is the most addictive narcotic on the market.
Where's your proof?
It takes a lot more than hired muscle and a shiny factory to impress me.
You want proof?
I want 100% customer retention.
Follow me.
"Guys, I found Bosley."

- She's nobody.
- She have a name?
- None she remembers.
Your narcotic's impressive.
Just keep looking.
I was always different.
My mom is an angry woman.
Life was neverthe same.
When I moved to Istanbul for university... she hired Zindan.
"Even so, she destroys my clothes... if she doesn't like them."
Why can't you be honest and tell the truth to yourparents?
Honesty is the easiest.
You don't understand.
Honesty will kill me.
"No, I can't understand."
What could possibly happen?
They are your parents.
They love you.
My mom is obsessed with cleaning.
I am not clean.
"What ever happens, happens."
We can change it.
We're going to the police.
"Tomorrow, OK?"
"Sir, we need to ask you a few questions."
Yourson Ahmet filed a complaint.

Nevermind.
"Hello, you're still sleeping?"

We record the receipt of all documents.

You keep a log of them?
"Take a minute for me, please."
Look up the dates of Frank Anselmo's calls to this office.
"You're in the wrong pew, Mr. Calhoun."
Frank Anselmo never called this office.
What about the mayor?
"He's in his dressing room, Mr. Calhoun."
Where you been?
I was looking for you.
Trying to get to Senator Marquand.
"Well, he got through to me."
They're moving the convention to Miami.
Miami?
Why?
They like Miami.

"Whoopi Goldberg, Madonna just bought houses in South Beach."

"Cut, not cut."

I'm gonna pay my respects to Nettie Anselmo.
Do you think that's wise?
-What's wise got to do with it?
-The perception--
Fuck perception!
- His doctor?
I don't know.
"Oh, wait a minute. it could be a Dr Kessler."
"Yeah, Dr Kessler is a cardiologist here."
"- Could you check with him, please?"
- Sure.
Let me check.
'Dr Sigapelli to Cardiology.

I went to the market for five minutes and he's gone!
Where is Saul?

We don't know yet.
- Is there any word?
"- No, not yet."
"Dr Kessler will be here in a moment, but he knows nothing of a Mr Greenberg suffering a heart attack."
And international Life Support haven't dispatched an ambulance since last night.
Where is he?
What happened to Saul?
Where is he?
"Please, where is my husband?"
"Oh, Thomas."
- Please be calm.
- Why don't you go and find my husband?
Why don't you just go and find my Saul instead of torturing me!
- Lena!

"Okay, pal, hold it, hold it."

And then back to zero.
What about the bodyguards and your lady friend?

They took off.
Is there anything else I should know?

Thank you.
Forgive me.
That was my father's favourite.
Thank you for helping Margaret.
She's changed since you came.
I enjoy her company.
- Has she shown you the tree house?
- Not yet.
"Would you do me the honour, Miss Dashwood?"
- It is very fine out.
- With pleasure.
- Margaret always wanted to travel.
- I know.
She's off to China soon.
"I'm to go as her servant, on the understanding I'll be badly treated."
- What will your duties be?

Which will take precedence?

- Where is this?
"- The Falconer's Arms, opposite..."
- The Green Dragon.
- The night Lau died.
- I'm guessing 5 minutes before he died.
- What?
- Keep watching.
Kevin Grey is walking out that door to kill Freddie Lau.
Come on - you have nothing here.
So I had a drink with Freddie Lau one evening - so what?
This is accessory to murder.
No.
"Harry, I need something here, Harry."
Old friend.
You've been lying all along about this.
I think Kayleigh Fenchurch was murdered as a warning to Lau.
Then someone set Kevin Grey on the path to revenge.
Someone screwed with his head just enough to make him kill Lau.
"A nice, neat love triangle - case closed."

This is indeed strange
We hope you can clear things up for us!
"The silver ingot is engraved with the word ""San"""
"Y es, ""San""!"
San is on it!
Y es
Where did you get it?
Zhou Sanzhao gave it to me
What?
Zhou Sanzhao is the most notorious murderer
How will he gave you money?
That's right!
"He didn't really give it to me, I..."
"Master, he's lying again"
Y es!
He's lying again!
Where did you get the money?
"Gao Jian, tell dad the truth!"
"Quick, otherwise Master will punish you!"
Zhou Sanzhao threw money... at the prostitutes
So I dressed up as a woman and got his money
Dressed up as a prostitute?
Good idea!
"Y es, yes, he does look like a woman!"
!
- Nope.

Miss?
Val?
Hi.
Heh.

"The gown, everything..."
He actually left them here last night.

She probably mentioned me.
Hope I didn't lead her on.
"See, I'm going to college soon, and I... and I don't want any loose ends."
I'm in the middle of my act.
"Sure, but the thing is he's got to get it back, so if you could strip a little more in our direction..."
I'm such a screw-up.
"Huh. ""Integrity."""

"- Oh, you're not?"
Yeah.

What might've happened?

He's a paranoid hit man who knocked you about.
- How many more clues d'you need?
- There's another side to him.
- Is it worse?
- He's like a little boy.
With a gun.
"China, you're a delicate precious creature."
I don't want you being taken advantage of and me having to hear about it second-hand.
Nobody is taking advantage of anybody.

- Course I do.
"- Oh, you're great, you."
You're like me other dad.

"Good, good."

Someone else!
You're a genius.
That's why the lock was broken.
"'Cause someone else got here first, right?"
Someone who didn't want anyone to find whatever was in here.
"So, that means there was definitely something to find."
Right?
- Oh!
What do we have here?
"- Hey, hey!"
You can't just take that.
- It might be there for security.
‭
"- First, this is new."
"Second, that thing over there is for security."
Someone's been keeping an eye on this place.
Maybe Eddie...
- Who's Eddie?

And I had a little look around Janet Cramer's rooms.
Simon!
"Just, you know, to see if I could cut the Gordian knot."
By breaking and entering?
!
"Oh, that's what we do now, is it?"
"Not breaking and entering, more easing and entering."
That's not the point.
"The missing research wasn't there, but this was."
Mary Goodyear's will.
"Don't worry, it's a photocopy."
Cramer won't know.
"That is so far from being my objection to what you've done here, Simon."
There's no mention of research.
"Evelyn, I appreciate all the effort you've put into this... but there comes a time whereyou have to walk away."
Come on.
Isn't there something I can do to persuadeyou?
There's nothing you can do.

You taught me better than that.
It was so stupid.
I should have been more thorough.

I know.
I just feel like I should do something.
You should.

"Eric, the powder ?"
You were right.
Some of the trace we found in Bob's apartment was cocaine.
What was it cut with ?
"Vitamin A, Vitamin C, and five percent bisacodyl."
It's a laxative.

It's Julio Pena's cut.

He's decreased on the left.

"Ken Ambrose, 34, tib-fib fracture with dislocation."
F. D. had to lift a flower shop off his leg.
Not a shop.
It's a kiosk!

"Okay, bye."

We got a new announcer today.
Slava Silkis.
He was a very political broadcaster in Leningrad.
"I think they're afraid of taking the risk, so..."
You're not even listening.
I'm listening.
"Slava Silkis, was a very political broadcaster."
"Now I want the lemon, please."
Cut her some lemon.
I'm doing the rice.
"Anyway, Slava Silkis said to tell you he saw the show."
"He hardly understands Hebrew, but enjoyed it immensely."
Let them wait.
Yes.
But I said I was coming.
Bye.
So you spoke with Slava Silkis about the show.
I'm not talking about that anymore.
But you said he saw the show.
- It doesn't matter now.
"Okay, it doesn't matter."
"Goni, the salad."
You have to mix it well after you add the lemon.
It's been mixed enough.
No!
- Goni.
Ora.
I see the red smoke.
Come on in.
Out.
COLEMAN:
Give them a hand.
"- Morning, Max, Collier."
"- Morning, sir."

Nothing is kept in mind.
Asshole.
No one will know of this incident.
"Addons Eli and me again, Jo."
This has created Addons The best video game.
"Addons Of course, all about my identity, will be removed."
"Addons Before your death, to be watched again and again ..."
"Addons Eye for eye, my dear."
Addons What have you done with my daughter?
Please.
It's okay?
Addons I'm afraid not.
Addons That's very nice and interesting.
I do not believe it.
You're a liar.
He is calling your name.
Addons

Addons like you.
Addons I am very busy.
"Addons Busy, with wild animals."

"With a father like you, it's no wonder."
Addons 6 minutes into the deadly crash.
"Addons Goodbye, Jo."

"Sir, you can't leave now!"
I have to registeryour name.
Where is he?
I'm an inspector.
Just continue.
"- Right, nurses, ignore them."

Don't disturb the doctor.
Put your guns down.
- What happened?
- There was a gunshot.

- Over there.
Get everybody out.
I'll call H.Q
- Any progress in the Weng case?
"- No, none at all."
-Okay.
"So, just for fun, what would happen if I wasn't here on Monday?"
EMERSON:
Has there been a horrible train accident?
No.
Train's here. I'm just not on it.
It wouldn't be fun.
"Come on, what would happen?"
I'd have to make a phone call.
You'd have to make a phone call?
I would make a phone call.
-No fun.
-Company man.
(GUNSHOT)
Hi.
-How you doing?
-Good.

You should have seen your face back there.
EMERSON:

"I had a great weekend, thanks for asking."
So you got that text?

What I already knew.
"Yeah, I got it."
Did you get mine?
"I was trying to make a joke about the White House Correspondents' dinner, but my phone spell-checked it into whorehouse correspondents' dinner."
Lemon pudding's not bad.
Be back in half an hour.
Like a sauna in here.

What'll it be?
"A burger, fries and a Coke."
How is the lemon pudding?
- Homemade.
- I'll give it a shot.
- To go.
- You got it.
"Say, why is this called The Floyd Diner instead of Floyd's Diner?"
"Because you're in Floyd, New York."
Who'd have thunk it?
"Floyd, New York."
"Like Clyde, New Jersey."
Could you imagine spending your life in a place like this?
I can.
I grew up in one.
"Ferriday, Louisiana."
There's something special about small-town life.
So what are you doing in New York?
Every Louisiana boy catches politics like a disease.
I didn't know that.
"That's a fact, and I was no exception."
After law school I headed where?
"Floyd, New York."
Washington.
Leapfrogged from staffer to congressional assistant until the mayor of New York City came down to testify.
And he gave a speech that day that will stay with me for the rest of my life.
It isn't hard to find.
Is it true what the newspapers say?
That you never drive a car?
I never have to.
I was thinking of helping you... with communcations.
"Well, that should be fine..."
Now to test it.
Want to come with me?
"Yes, with pleasure, but what was the problem?"
Nearly nothing at all.
"Just old, I think."
The damned motor was stuck together with wire when I got here...
But it's been fixed.
I hope so.
"Enough, enough!"
Did General Cork send you to be my latin lover?
Enough!
- Confess.
"- Yes, yes, enough!"
"Forgive me, I was cruel, forgive me..."
Everyone is cruel sometimes.

Careful.
"Yes, five dollars."
"You're disgusting, stay away from me!"
You depraved animal!
"Cretin, pervert!"
How can they do it?
"My god, how can they sell their own children?"
They're hungry.
"Yeah, I do, too, but don't cling to it."
It'll make you lazy and angry.
- Your work will suffer.
- I'll keep that in mind.
And I don't believe you need to exacerbate these instincts in yourself more than you already do.
You got it.

- Yeah.
"- Oh, do you have any weed?"
"- No, can I have my mail?"
"- Hello, baby."
- Would you like to take Evie?
- Certainly not.
I can't afford to smell of vomit.
"- Yeah, I know, I remember."
- Maybe one of the other girls can take care of her.
- Is M free at the moment?
- Thank you.
- Um.
What did you do that for?
"- 'Cause it's not the first time a client's written me a love letter, Lily."
- Really?
Like what?
What kind of stuff do they write?
"Well, like what?"
"Roses are red, violets are blue,"
I pay you money and we fuck.

And so faithful.
You'd get the same at the pub.

"No protocol, Ludovic."
"Carlos, take the camera."

"- Passports, please."
Good morning.
Do the Serbian phones work?
- No phones.
How come the welcome concert?
- It is the Serbia In Ball dance campaign.
The state wants us to give a positive image of Serbia to foreigners.
Go for a walk.

It looks like Miss Serbia 2005.

Be seated!
This is my very dear brother.

My name probably appeared on the phone.
It only said 'dog' and 'bird' (wordplay for son of a b*itch).
'Dog' and 'bird'?
Son of a b*tch?
"Anyways, Eul cannot take the call right now, so call later."
"If the person calling right now happens to be Sin Joon Young,"
I don't think there will be a need for you to call back.

You're mistaken.
You mustn't let them find you here.
Men aren't allowed in this building.
"I know, I didn't want anything to happen to you, but I saw a white thing crawl through here, and it looked like Wilbur."
NANCY:
"Oh, that's ridiculous."
Wilbur wouldn't do a thing like that.
"You're very fond of him, aren't you?"
Very.
I wish he belonged to me.
"You could do with a little of Wilbur's manners, you know."
"I'm sure they must be very charming, but he certainly didn't have any trouble worming his way in."
"Well, no, he didn't."
"And he doesn't come climbing into people's rooms in the middle of the night, either."
What was that?

"Hold on, for Heaven's sake!"
"All right, all right!"
I'm all right!
But I don't really know the exact time.
Is it '84 now?
"It's half past four, if you please!"
"Just stay there, I'll fetch help."
1984.
"Floods in Italy, the Security Council is having a meeting..."
Everything fits.

Ashwini having driven it...
The windshield of the car having broken...
He seemed to know everything.
He threatened that he had evidence for it all.
Ashwini and I...
Ashwini immediately pleaded guilty.
"Ashwini is an NRI, right?"
"Yes, Sir."
- Hit-and-run case.
"If an FIR is filed, she can't go back."
You must help us!
"Please, Sir!"
I ensure that a case is not filed.
"But if any of his relative create a problem, we need to silence them."
That will cost you.
"No, Manoj."
"Sir, I killed him."
I accept my fault.
"Keep quiet, Ashwini!"
Sir...
What should we do?
Manoj.
Where is Ashwini now?
She didn't like me bribing the cop.
She felt guilty and left the same day.
I don't know where she went or what she is doing now.
- Goodbye.

I've got a masterpiece that you're going to hear right now.
You're going to flip out.
"Alicia, my dear, farewell."
Oh... dear...
Take care.
"You take care too, Katerina."
Though you look gorgeous.
"""Trenches"" must be made."
"Zelda, didn't you used to have a crush on Stuart Ramsey?"
Maybe when I was eight.
He might be interesting now.
He's done well for himself.
Practically runs the post office.
"Then why don't you be interested, Ellie?"
"Why, I hadn't thought about it."
[gasping] [giggling]
I hadn't thought about it but I possibly could be.
Zelda's got her hands full with Mr. Sellers.
And Mr. Fitzgerald.
[sighs] Don't you two have anything better to talk about?
"No, this is Montgomery."
[laughs]
"Oh, look, it's Bucky Turner."
[horn honking]
"We see you, Bucky!"
We're gonna tell your mama!
His mother's dead.
"Sorry, Bucky, about your mama!"
[giggling]
Livy:
"I know this is awful to say, but... sometimes I miss the war."
Livy.
You have to agree it was more fun.
"More men, more falling' in love."
Fallin' in love?
"Yeah, fallin' in love, pretty near every night."
- Not me.
"- That's because your daddy didn't let you go to the dances, but Zelda and I, we participated in the war effort."
Doesn't this take the cake?
Milton Grable.
She didn't even bother packing her bags!
How she was fed up with my poor cop father!
And he with her.
It killed her.
She wallowed with those pigs.
"In their dough, their drugs, their shit!"
"Mommy, mommy, my mommy!"
I followed.
"They fed me, they dressed me, they beat me, but they never sullied me."
"I'm like her, I'm like her,"
"I'm like her, like her..."
like her...
I'm like her...
"Mommy, mommy... mommy!"
My mommy...
Now that I am King... and that the Queen is Queen...
"""Impossible"" is a French word."
I'll never marry you.
Leave the ending to me.
I need this money!
I need this money...
It's too swell.
Expatriation!
What is that?
"Oh yes, I forgot to tell you, the big surprise!"
Your mother's corset exploded.
"Ambulance, firemen, four nurses, two obstetricians."
"Nine and a half pounds on arrival, incognito for seven months!"
A triumph!
It's all your doing...
Madam's my age.
"""From each according to his faculties;"
"Mickey, grab a cab!"
"Tom, bring his clothes!"

You got nothing to lose but your worries!

Hold it!
Okay!

- Never a dull moment at the Fun Palace!
"There's something for everyone, from 8 to 80!"
"Yes, sir!"
"Something to surprise the men and shock the women, or vice-versa!"
I thought you didn't believe him.
You convinced me it was all baloney and now what are you saying?
That Morn went to Paris in order to get pregnant?
I'd better kill myself now.
Maybe
Dad and her jumped in bed every time she got back?
"That makes sense too, doesn't it?"
What did she do?
Vacation.
Just vacation?
She'd show up at my house once a year and rest.
- Did she have someone?
- What?
Did she see someone?
How dare you?
!
"Aunt Rosa, answer us."
We just want to know if Mom had someone.
Before or after Dad.
- Why?
- Because!
Why can't just you tell us?
!
- Why are you shouting?
- Because you annoy me!
"If she shouts I won't tell you anything, not about Algeria or anything."
Algeria?
What about Algeria?
Did she have someone in Algeria?
Did she go to Algeria?
How?
They wouldn't let an Israeli in.
"I'm all right, thanks."
Just...
I'm all right.
"Built in 1972, then demolished the following year before being rebuilt in 85, the Bulwer-Lytton building is a classic example of the late modernist, post-Bauhaus development from humanist rationalist impulses from utility."
"Inspired by Alvar Aalto's signature style, the building is built..."
Psst!
In here.
Come in here.
"... Social interaction and the hyper relevance of volume as, er..."
I wanna talk to you.
"Come here, then."
What are you doing?
The idea is to walk across the room.
The room's full of shit.
This is a lab.
It's an experiment.
Come here.
For fuck's sake.
Fuck.
"Oh, shit!"
Bollocks.
Well done.
Well done?
"You got here, though."
What do you want from me?
Hey!
Who's in there?
Over here!
Better run.
Hey!
Stop!
"Come back here, you!"
Landlord says she lives alone.
"And it appears that Pamela or JMJ or whoever, has a predilection for white cotton gloves."
He saw white cotton gloves?
Through her bathroom window.
12 pairs hanging on clothes pegs from her shower curtain.
It's her!
She's the killer!
She's the killer!
Yeah.
The electronic scratch on those anonymous calls?
She used a device to make her voice sound like a man's.
"Sorry about the interruption, JMJ, it was rude."
My name is Pamela.
Pamela?
Do you have a light?
Hmm.
I'm confused.
Why does the lease to your apartment read JMJ Wilgis?
My lease?
"What do your initials stand for, JMJ?"
Pamela.
It's Pamela.
Then who's JMJ?
"Is she, what, your sister?"
Why does she have 12 pairs of white cotton gloves hanging on her shower curtain?
- Answer me!
- You can't treat me like crap!
- Sit down.
- Go to hell!
- Sit down!
- No!
Sit... down!
I don't understand.
How does that make you money?
Do carol singers have to pay you 10 percent?
"They should, but you can't always catch the little bastards."
It's on every Christmas album ever made.
Elvis did it.
The Muppets.
An American punk band called...
Remember where we live?
"Flat 2, 31 Craysfield Road, Islington, London, N12SF."
"England, the world, the universe."
Yeah.
We'd like to go to Planet Hollywood.
Jesus.
Really?
Yeah.
It's supposed to be brilliant.
Planet Hollywood is horrible.
Marcus?
This is hopeless.
Look at the length of the queue.
"It's probably because Bruce Willis is inside, or Sylvester Stallone."
They won't be in there.
"Yes, they will."
They're here all the time.
Unless they're working.
"Even then, they try to make films in London so they can come here for lunch."
I'm really hungry.
Does this place you're talking about have good fries?
Fantastic fries.
Come on.
Let's go.
Redemption costs.
"And on my watch, you fucking pay up front."
Everything you know about Latif.
Or I put a fucking bullet in your head right now.
Latif has a spy at the top of British intelligence.
"Neutralize him, and you'll stop the atrocity Latif has planned."
He can't finalize the arrangements without him.
Who is he?
I need a name.
When my daughter is safe.
Last chance.
"Oh, you need Clare safe, as much as I do."
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
People die.
I'm fine with that.
You fucking prick.
"Shoot, then."
(DISTORTED EXPLOSION)
Fuck.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)
"Hello, Maggie."
I'm Eleanor Grant.
Can I get you a drink?
"No, but can you can turn off the recording device in your pocket."
This conversation is off the record.
We never met.
Do you understand?
(DEVICE BEEPS OFF)
Damien said you were a ball breaker.
"Well, Damien Scott talks too much and to people he shouldn't."
He knows he can trust me.
I have to sent you to jail for one day.
Immediate execution.
"Your Honour, are you kidding me?"
"Your Honour, can you give me face?"
Hubby.
Are you kidding me?
"Your Honour, for what we've just heard, should we forget them too?"
"Since the statement is against legal procedure,"
"Jury, you should forget everything you've just heard."
Chan Mon-gut will be represented by Wu Man.
"Tomorrow, the final address should be presented."
Court.
Brother Foon.
Miss Shui.
Why are you here?
I come to save you.
"Alright, I'll pack up first."
I just want to prove your personality.
I am right.
You are a gutless coward.
What?
"If you leave like this, you will be sinful forever."
You can't live peacefully and you'd hide up for the rest of your life.
You would be a criminal forever.
I have decided to stay.
That's why I love you.
Creep!
"Ho Foon, someone comes to visit you."
Miss Shui.
Where did you cut your hair?
"Number 9, Nathan Road."
"Cut the crap, I won't go."
- Stand still!
- Get out.
All right.
No one will come in here.
Stay on the door.
The Frenchman.
What'd he say?
It's about us being revolutionaries like him.
The captain wants to see me about him now.
Got the petition?
Take care of him.
"We are revolutionaries, but they do things properly."
The French with the guillotine!
"We've had this ship, and Scott-Padget's still alive!"
Wait.
You can go now.
Come in.
"You wish to see me, sir?"
- Mr. Crawford?
- Sit down.
Where are we heading?
"Oh, my committee aren't decided yet."
"Caribbean, South America..."
Anywhere but England.
It's of England I wish to speak to you.
Colonel Giraud has vital information about an intended invasion.
- That's the truth.
- Invasion?
We got the landing places and the approximate date out of him.
But he knows a great deal more.
He must be handed over for questioning at once.
Handed over?
"- Oh, I'm glad you listened to reason."
"- Dad, wow."
"As of tomorrow morning, Julie will be the new Chief Executive Officer of the Newport Group."
"Who needs more champagne, hmm?"
"- Hey, thanks."
- Yup.
- Any Summer sightings?
"- Oh, no, not yet."
What if she doesn't show?
"What if, after all this, she never knows the blood and sweat and-and other people's pee that went in to getting her those tick"
"Well, then you'd be happy for her 'cause you're her friend, right?"
"Totally, yeah."
"Hey, you came."
- Where's Zach?
"- Oh, um, he couldn't make it."
"- Oh, that's..."
That's real... that's too bad.
"Um, let me show you to your very V.I.P. seating."
It's this way.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I wasn't planning on coming here tonight.
I'm here for Team Summer.
I'm here for Team Seth.
"So, what do you think?"
- Seth and Summer... star-crossed lovers?
- Or better off just friends.
- Destined to be together?
- Or just too dysfunctional together to make it work.
- I guess only time will tell.
"- Yeah, I guess."
"You want to go in, watch the band?"
I'm gonna miss that happy fat.
But you are a lot sexier this way.
"You know, I lost 10 pounds."
"Bob, you weigh exactly what you weighed on our wedding night."
- Right.
- Ah.
Where are you going?
"Oh, I'll be back... in 45 minutes."
- [Rings]
- Hello?
- 120 over 80.
"- Okay, Bob."
That oughta do it.
Good.
How's everything look?
"Everything seems fine: solids, liquids, triglycerides, cholesterol, blood sugar, E.K.G."
"Actually, it is one of the most boring physicals I have ever given."
"Now, you might be a couple of pounds overweight... but at least... we know where it is."
- [Giggles]
"- Are you, uh"
- Are you saying I'm fat?
Fat?
No.
Let's just say you're a little short for your weight.
"I mean, I think you're in pretty good shape for a 49-year-old man."
"I'm, uh-I'm 41."
"Bob, your chart says... 49."
"Well, I'm"
"- I'm definitely 41, at least I will be this Thursday."
Then why does your chart say 49?
"Oh, that's"
- The battery runs down.
"Now, what sort of a reduction are you going to give me on this room?"
- 60% if you turn it on.
- What?
My wife handles all such matters.
I'm sure she will be delighted to discuss it with you.
I shall speak to her after lunch.
"You heard that all right, didn't you?"
- What?
- Thank you so much.
Lunch will be served at half past 12:00.
Manuel!
Manuel!
Are you going to the betting shop today?
- What?
"- Oh, don't you start!"
You go betting shop today?
"Oh, sí!"
"Betting shop, sí!"
"Now, I want you to put this on this little horse,"
"Dragonfly, but... big secret."
Sybil no know.
"No, no, it's lovely."
It's just a bit buttery with my skin.
"I think I need something more... more... topazy, for my coloring, you know, more tonal."
Have you got...
have you got Cosmopolitan there?
"Page 42, you see Burt Reynolds?"
"Well, there's a girl standing behind him looking at James Caan."
That sort of color.
Mm.
Lovely.
There's no one else here.
You must be talking to me.
"Well, that was an antique."
Crap!
"Oh, yeah."
So good.
"Oh, that explains his mysterious trip to Holland."
And I had the greatest time.
"Mr. Burns's house has everything-- a hedge maze, a moat, bleached hardwood floors and a bottomless pit."
"a hedge maze, a moat, bleached hardwood floors and a bottomless pit."
- It couldn't possibly be bottomless.
- For all intents and purposes.
Hey!
"Mom, Bart's throwing peas!"
"Bart, don't throw peas at your sister."
Mr. Burns throws peas at Smithers.
Ow!
That was a big one!
"- Homer, say something."
- Okay.
"Lisa, quit getting in the way of your wealthy brother's peas."
- [ Groans ]
"- Oh, yuck."
Meat loaf.
My most hated of all loafs.
[ Gasps ] That was the end piece!
That's it!
Being abusive to your family is one thing... but I will not stand idly by and watch you feed a hungry dog!
- Go to your room!
- No!
This family stinks!
Mr. Burns nurtures my destructive side.
-No!
-You'd better take your boy and go.
"I've never, never been so humiliated and disgusted!"
Allison!
Come back here immediately!
"If you keep this up, someday I'll do what you keep accusing me of."
I don't doubt it.
You're just like your father about sex!
"In that way, you're just like him!"
Don't you say things about my father.
He was a wonderful man!
-Wonderful.
-Fine and good to you.
That's what you told me.
So don't blame him for anything!
"Wonderful, and fine, and good."
That's what I told you?
I lied.
I lied about him because I was ashamed of him and of myself.
-Then why did you marry him?
-I didn't!
And he didn't marry me because he already had a wife!
"-You don't mean that, mother."
-I do mean it.
-Don't you understand?
-No...
He had a wife!
No!
Nellie!
Allison!
"Connie, everybody reacts differently to suicide."
"With Allison, severe shock."
What could it be?
We're waiting.
Gamze came here too.
The three of us are waiting.
What's Gamze doing there?
May God watch over you guys.
Did we buy those devices so the three of could stand together?
I congratulate you guys.
Is this all you can do?
"Ok, dude."
Calm down a little.
"Now, put your phones on silent and wait until you hear from me."
We won't give up.
We still have time.
We will keep waiting.
Uluc says we'll wait.
Come on.
Hello?
They arrived at a shopping mall.
I am following them...
Is everything alright with you guys?
"Things are a little bit complicated here, but you keep following her."
"My dear Candan, it is such an untimely devotion to music."
Here's your mobile number.
"Now, I need an address for a recording company."
"Pick it up, pick it up."
Hello?
- Am I speaking with Professor Candan?
"- Yes, speaking."
"Professor, I am calling from Bemol Records"

-This is Cevat Ceyhan.
Sis!
Look!
You're right!
It's really beautiful!
"It's been a while since you have looked like this, Sis!"
Really?
Yeah!
You looked like this for a long time!
Was it really like that?
It looks lke you became her wind.
Eh?
"To that kid, your point of view is like a wind to the fog around her."
Sorry for keeping you waiting.
Don't worry about it.
"More importantly, did you bring what you wrote?"
"Yeah, I did."
I am still good friends with Saho-san.
Saho-san's smoke will never vanish.
It only disappears for a little while.
"It's weird, but I really feel like I understand your stories, Hibara-san."
Thank you.
"When we talk, Saho-san's smoke sometimes vanishes."
I am happy even if I can only become Saho-san's wind every so often.
"I really don't like when the seasons change, because they start to come out."
HA HA HA!
I'm not worried about it!
What's with that weird confidence you have?
!
"Could it be that it happened again, Mizuki?"
!
Yeah!
But this time...
(MAN) (SPEAKING GERMAN)
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
She's coming with us.
Eh!
Eh!
We have to do something.
"Yes, but in due time."
How can you be so calm?
"If you would be so kind, tell me the joke about the Spanish hell."
What are you doing here?
Thinking about how to get out.
Wait!
Wait.
Get me out of here.
I have an even more important secret for Himmler.
"Here inside there is a time door, only one."
I can show you hundreds.
Traitor.
(WHISPERS) You have no idea.
"I hate to disappoint you, but the Holy Grail isn't in Montserrat."
"Our only grail is our Blessed Virgin and our custom, to kiss her."

Tell him that I hope he enjoys his cyanide.
You speak German.
-I studied in Tübingen.
"Look, I know that I can't prohibit you from treading this holy ground but I can confine myself to my cell until you leave here."
Take care not to break anything.
Should we fear God's wrath?
-No.
You should fear mine.
Heil Hitler.
Fräulein Lola Mendieta.
- It's a little tight.
"- Yes, that's to correct your posture."
Soon you'll have a mighty hump.
Now you really are my son.
This calls for a celebration.
Let's fire some employees.
Excellent.
"Okay, let's make this sporting, Leonard."
"If you can tell me why I shouldn't fire you without using the letter ""E""... you can keep your job."
"Uh, okay."
Um--
- I'm a good work-- guy.
- You're fired.
- But I didn't say--
- You will.
Eeeeeeee!
[ Chortling ]
Let me try one.
Mmm.
Mmm.
"Hey, the trail of donuts ended."
- [ Gasps ] Bart!
- [ Gasps ] Homer!
[ Gasps ] What a coincidence!
And a perfect opportunity for you to prove your loyalty.
"Go ahead, Bartholomew."
You may fire when ready.
- [ Groans ] - [ Whimpers ]
Hurry.
Fire him now or I'll disown you.
You'll lose everything.

"Navy Cut for you, Mrs Turner, and for you, Mrs Ellis."
-
- Thank you.
-
"- You get worse, Granville."
-
"- Keep taking the pills, Granville!"
-
"- And who is she browning herself for, is a question that springs to the lips."
It can't be her husband.
Have you seen him?
It's the way he walks.
Nobody's going brown all over just for him.
Can you imagine him with nothing on?
I bet we'd have to if we saw him with nothing on!
He's fixed her up with some wonderful kitchen units.
Has he?
-
- What are you glaring at me for?
-
- What am I g--glaring at you for?
Look at all them opportunities you missed!
They only came in for cigarettes.
That's all they ever come in for.
What they come in for is up to them.
What they go out with is up to us!
Can't get a word in edgewise with them two.
They never listen.
-
Give it a thought.
Think about it.
It's my mistake to have had a tea without getting you one.
Have a tea in my credit.
Perumal...
Sir.
"If this program becomes a hit, your photo will become viral on social media."
People will praise you as the ideal cop.
"After which... promotion, salary hike..."
- Get lost.
Panju Sir!
Panju Sir!
How long will you be an underdog?
When will you rise to occasion?
I'm going to pee.
Step aside.
Sir.
"Okay, Sir."
Greetings.
Inspector asked to come here.
Didn't you bring your gun?
I wonder how you will manage without it!
Go upstairs.
"Hey, crow!"
"Perumal, one strong tea."
Make it two.
"- Okay, Sir."
"What's up, Sir?"
Would you like to have any fried snacks?
No tension!
I gave an idea to change your image altogether.
Now it's upto you.
Please.
You're frightening me.
"Can't you stop that, man?"
This is a hospital.
Abel to Security.
"Abel, are you down there?"
Abel to Security.
I'm not afraid of you.
I'm not frightened of you!
I'm interested in getting some hours in the sleep lab...
"I only sign off on the paperwork, Elmer, as I think you know."
Good luck.
Dr. Massingale.
I heard you need volunteers in the sleep lab.
"Elmer, that depends."
On what?
Whether you're interested in working or flirting.
"You've got a bit of a reputation, I'm afraid."
- As a flirter?
- And for being a practical joker.
I'll be the best sleeper in the house.
"Okay, but you..."
"What's going on, may I ask?"
"We waited, and then we held the meeting without you."
"Really, Dr. Hook?"
Very funny.
But regardless of what Dr. Hook says... the meeting begins when I arrive.
It ends when I leave.
Any questions?
Have a seat.
Any time.
Any admissions since yesterday?
"I'd rather not, to be honest."
Give it to me.
Let it go.
Let it go.
Thank you.
"Now, you, my palm, your arse, now."
Move it!
"I'll eat you alive, I'm telling you."
"Oh, bull's-eye."
Me tooth!
He's knocked out me hurty tooth!
"Well, I couldn't say no."
Ptolemy made me an absurdly generous offer.
What about that puppy you were carrying around?
"Oh, I put him down - in every sense."
That little dirt dispenser shat all over my mosaic.
"And Rambo, was he put down?"
Sadly not.
"He's now managing the family vineyard, which sounds like a monumentally stupid idea to me, but there you go."
Hm...and how about us?
Are there still jobs for us here?
"Oh, yes."
I've got some 'big jobs' for you.
Quick game of spongebucket?
"Yeah, go on, then."
"Previously on ""Second Chance""..."

"You're the first to journey all the way back, to get another chance."
I know you.
She can be.
We will see.
"You are more attracted by the comical gendre,... than by the dramatic."
By the master of erotica.
Back in your dress.
"You have a great future ""behind'."
-What actress?
-More.
All of you!
Leave a photo with my secretary.
"-Thank you, maestro."
-Thanks.
We will keep a picture of yourself.
"-Thanks, maestro!"
-Thanks.
Thank you miss.
I told him that was exceptional.
Thanking you too.
"Here it is, I recommend it."
"- Archive ""A""?"
-How did you guess?
What are you doing tonight?
As I said.
I am going to the movies with my boyfriend.
You expect to get it outside of yourself?
I see what you're getting at!
But why?
"Because it won't let you go, before first telling you something about yourself."
Anything?
What?
Something or the other.
An adventure for example.
The lady that went in the elevator...
Is that a student?
No.
I think that I know her family...
"No, no."
She's a teacher.
"Hi, sweetheart!"
Ready for cyberspace?
I just got in a very exclusive chat room.
A friend has just arrived.
She's an Internet virgin.
You do this every night?
No.
On Thursdays I eat at my mother's... then I come home and take a Valium.
Wouldn't you rather meet someone live?
In a real place?
Like at the beach?
And compete with those teenagers who live at the gym?
No.
Thank you.
By any chance... do you meet live people in real places?
No... but I don't want to meet anyone.
Everyone wants to meet someone.
I already met the person I was supposed to meet... and I married him.
Are you divorced?
No.
Widowed.
I'm sorry.
"No, Nadine."
It's not like I'm some traumatized madwoman.
"Okay, but I am."
Must be Gary.
Badly.
"Well, we see."

-You.
You.

"-Ah, very well, thanks."
"Yours no, cretino."
The one of the patient.
"Ah, yes."
"Professor, he does not think that he is embarrassed?"
It seems to you the moment for joking?
Cretino.
"It feels, feels."
You see it?
It is aerophagia.

"-Sir, want to come in?"
"-Yes, thanks."
"For the traditional, parents flanking their graduate child."
- Don't they look proud?
- They do.
Very proud.
What is that?
It's pictures of Sookie's high school graduation.
What was your high school graduation like?
"It was dignified, as most French ceremonies are."
"Poetry was read, a string quartet played, a ballerina performed."
Drank Boone's Farm out of a bota bag and knocked a beach ball around?
I don't understand half of what you say.
That's why we work.
- Hello.
"- Hey, Lor, how you doing?"
Christopher.
I'm good.
I'm excited.
You should be.
It's a big day.
Did you get my present?
- What present?
- A basket.
You should've gotten it by now.
- Did a basket come for me?
- It came.
It was heavy.
"I felt a twinge, so I dropped it for health reasons."
It's probably still intact.
My cracked staff has just informed me of its arrival.
I'm going to find it.
I put it together myself.
- And it's all for me?
Shepherd.
Might as well do it on your watch.
Grey's Anatomy Season 5 Episode 12 Sympathy for the Devil
Why do you have to live in Meredith's attic?
How am I supposed to sneak out of here with that frat party going on downstairs?
Don't you kids ever sleep?
They're cleaning the house for dr.
Shepherd's mother.
Mrs. Shepherd is coming?
- To Seattle?
- So?
"So that woman practically raised me, taught me right from wrong, and if she found out that I was..."
"With you, that we were..."
You're Meredith Grey's little sister.
You are forbidden fruit.
You are 25.
- You're a fetus.
- 24.
I skipped third grade.
I feel dirty.
10 bucks that she tanks in the first 5 minutes.
I have faith in Death.
She'll make a good impression.
She's holding that bottle of tequila like it's a life vest.
"Mer, don't listen to them."
- She's gonna love you.
- No.
Mothers don't love me.
Mothers like bright and bubbly and happy and...
Izzie.
Mothers love Izzie.
They do.
"I grabbed him by the lapels, I said,"
"""This is it."
Your time.
Bucky time.
"Go get her."""
He looked so cool walking over to her.
So brave.
[ Breathes deeply ]
She looked up and saw him and smiled.
♪♪
They were so fast.
[ Whispers ] Jocks always are.

It was a half a second before Bucky's pants hit the ground.
- [ Fabric drops ]
- He just froze...
- [ Laughter ] - ...standing there in his little white undies.
The laughs were deafening.
"He turned to me, his eyes pleading for help, trembling..."
I did nothing!
"- I couldn't even get out ""Bucky!"" - [ Gasps ]"
"He turned around and ran, his pants still at his ankles, until he was out the door."
And I never saw him again.
"Until Monday at school, when I saw him again."
But he was different.
He would never be the same.
The Bucky I knew was dead.
And now it's happening all over again.
Not if we stop it.
"I was excited about my prom, too."
I had the cutest vintage YSL jumpsuit.
"And when I got there, the nuns got all weird because my date was a 28-year-old Wall Street banker."
"Yeah, fuck you, man."
Hi.
Hi.
Goin' out?
"Twenty dollars for me, five for the room."
No.
"Fifteen for me, five for the run."
How old are you?
Twenty.
You'll catch a cold in that costume.
Nah.
Where's the room?
[Distant shouting]
You probably know the rules.
"Five dollars a half hour, five dollars each additional half, ten dollars deposit,"
I'll give you back five if you're out on time.
"Clean sheets five bucks extra, five bucks deposit on the sheets."
You want the sheets?
Yeah.
You want the sheets?
"Oh, yeah, yeah, we gotta have the sheets."
"Uh, what does that all add up to?"
Twenty-five bucks.
"These are clean ones, huh?"
Have a good time.
"God, what happened to you?"
Who did this to you?
Is that what you want?
"Dirty stories, is that how you get off?"
No.
But what kind of person would do a thing like that?
Some guy took me to a chicken place.
"-What you've always done, sweet boy."
Just what your mother tells you.
I was gonna mail it.
Yah!
Giddyup.
Well?
I have a message for you from the bride.
It seems to be a poem.
"""With apologies to Robert Herrick."
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may

What a woman.
It's breakfast and you're eating a piece of candy?
It's dessert.
There is no dessert with breakfast.
Maybe not where you live.
Will you at least take your vitamin?
"My God, you're a time bomb."
[Sighs]
"What you got goin' on there, bub?"
"Before I swallowed the vitamin, there was a lifesaver in my mouth."
Wow.
You're like the evel knievel of sucking candy.
Wish me luck.
I got it.
"And welcome back, butterscotch goodness."

"He tried to kill me, and I killed him first."
But you hid the body!
Why?
"Come in, Allison."
Allison!
I was never happier to see anyone in my life.
Are you all right?
"-Hi, Ted."
"-Hi, Allison."
"Mr. Partridge, I can testify about Lucas."
I saw him beat her.
"It will help, believe me."
We appreciate you coming for the trial.
-You're going to get her off?
-We're going to do the best we can.
But the jury decides on the one thing:
evidence.
"Now, it adds up to this:"
we have a murder and a defense that's too simple to be good.
It's open to attack from many sides.
"Selena, have you told me the whole story?"
I'm sorry!
There's no more to tell.
"Yeah, I'll take the dress shop before, okay?"
"Hello, Allison."
-You look well.
-With the drink in my hand?
Would you care for something?
I moved hoping I'd be left alone.
"-You haven't learned, have you?"
"-Oh, yes, I have, mother."
I learned to smoke and drink.
"Hmm, I see that you've been looking at the papers again."
Mm-hmm.
You want to tell me what's going on?
Okay.
Don't freak.
I got mugged today.
You got mugged?
!
"Not freaking, remember?"
I think someone's after the papers.
How do you know that?
Just tell me what happened.
"All right, since Mom couldn't help you with the encryption,"
I went to see Dad today.
Yeah?
He said that there might be something in the time capsule that could help me decode the papers.
Really.
It's--
It's under the bed.
Hello?
(Leo on phone) Angela.
"Hey, Leo."
I've been researching our artist.
He's got no money troubles.
No history of illicit or suspicious dealings.
He's clean.
Except for the fact that he was lying about something
"(Leo) Yeah, but what?"
Maybe it's time to have another conversation with Mr. Walker.
"I've already thought of that, but he's not answering his phone."
"I guess we're just gonna have to pay him a visit, then."
All right.
"That was a long day, wasn't it?"
I can't believe we've been working for 8 hours.
They could fly to Moscow without they mingle ice with ice flake.
"You know, Jocelyn, I gotta tell you one thing, I think you are... the best sprinkler I've ever seen."
"Indeed, indeed."
Marvelous!
I got a new calling.
Mom and dad are gonna love this one!
"Dad, I gotta follow my heart!"
"- Okay, my U$20.000 degree..."
- This is me.
I created the haze of Dublin in a Greenwich Village studio.
You want my vision?
You want my vision?
Where is Kathy Bates when we need her?
"- ""I'll never let go, Jack."""
- Send the life-boat...
"Paul, let's go."
I was just knocking around with Jocelyn.
"This is Jocelyn, your spritzer, you met her."
Hi!
I'm gonna be late for Patrick Tomarce's book party.
I gotta split.
Are you all right with your...
- what is that?
- Ribbon?
"Yeah, ribbon rapping?"
"- Jocelyn, I can help you."
"- Thanks, Alex."
"Well, I'll see you at the Carnival tomorrow."
"Don't touch me, you're all wet!"
"Jocelyn, I think we could get a cup of coffee after or something?"
"All three families lived within several miles of each other, but we never crossed paths until Lou's funeral."
- Do you remember this guy?
- Hell of a man.
"- Sure, I remember him."
- Did he ever ride in your cab?
"20, 40 times."
Who knows?
"He was a cab rider, strictly cab rider."
"- Yeah, he didn't drive?"
- Never.
He used to sit in front.
- He sat in front?
"- Oh, yeah."
- Really?
- Yeah.
"That was your dad, world-famous architect."
"Yeah, that was your father."
- Do you remember him at all?
"- A little bit, vaguely."
- Did he ever ride in your cab?
- Vaguely.
He loved the women.
"Not the young ones, but he loved the women."
Do you remember what he looked like or...
His face was pointed.
"Yeah, and his hair was..."
"his hair was, you know, very thin, like a blond."
- Like a what?
- Like it was blond.
Yeah.
"Oh, blond, uh-huh."
Do you remember that he had scars on his face?
EZRA:
Hmm.
Perhaps I could be persuaded to act as your advocate.
You?
[LAUGHS]
You're the one who had me locked up.
I don't find your story compellingly truthful.
"Well, I don't care what you think."
I know I'm innocent.
"All right, suit yourself."
Holler if you change your mind.
[EZRA chuckling ]
The judge says one of us needs to represent my father.
I don't think it should be me.
-Chris?
-What?
"Hell, Nathan, you know Chris don't say more than three words in a day."
"My apologies, Nathan, but I have legal issues of my own to deal with."
"That's all right, Ezra."
I wasn't thinking about asking you.
"Well, what you need is an honest, well-spoken..."
... handsomemanforthisjob.
"Fine, I'll do it."
Ain't nobody gonna listen to a youngster.
"Buck, you see a pretty girl in that courtroom, you're gonna be:"
I was thinking about Vin.
I get too nervous in front of a crowd.
What about Josiah?
He studied Cherokee law.
-That should count for something.
-And he's got a suit.
Josiah.
I`m looking forward to a Iong ride.
You get to see the kids all the time!
I see them two minutes in the morning two minutes in the evening and maybe three hours on the weekend.
Someday I`II wake up and realize my little babies are all grown up!
And then what?
I just thought it might be easier to fly.
"Nothing worthwhile is easy, ellen."
We know that.
Kids?
Who wants to see the trip plan?
"Dad, we`re playing!"
"Okay, shut off the video games."
"Come on, Russ."
Shut it off.
I know you`II enjoy this.
I worked out the trip on the computer so that we get the maximum amount of fun time at WaIIey world without missing any of the good stuff along the way.
Here we go!
There`s us.
And there`s WaIIey world!
"Now, Iet`s just take a look at Day One."
shall we?
"Honey, come on in!"
We`re going to do Day One!
"Now, there`s the family Truckster as we leave Chicago."
"Rusty, please, do not eat the Truckster!"
"Russ, do you mind?"
I`m trying to work this out here on the computer.
"Okay, Audrey."
"Thank you, Audrey."
That`s just great.
"Look out, Dad, here I come."
"AII right, that`s enough, Russ."
I know nothing about bullfighting but a lot about desperate women.
Yeah?
And who told you I'm desperate?
You gave me that impression.
You don't care about bullfighting.
You're interested in my relationship with El Nino.
"Tell ""El Pais"" the answer's no and leave me alone!"
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Get me out of here!
- What's wrong?
"Get me out of here, please."
There's a snake in the kitchen!
Give me the keys.
- The door's open.
"- Calm down, and stay here."
My purse...
Thank you.
Take me to a hotel.
I'm never going back to that house.
Which hotel?
"- The Eurobuilding, for example."
- Very well.
"Don't tell anyone about this snake business, please."
- Only my family knows about it.
- Don't worry.
One thing I respect is other people's phobias.
"After all you've done,"
I feel bad about saying no to the profile.
Sleep on it.
I'll call you tomorrow for your decision.
Thank you for everything.
The tourist is still on the loose.
But I have a hunch Daddy's gonna come back for his little girl.
So he's still alive.
"Not for very long, he isn't."
Don't screw up this time!
Motts!
You stay here with him.
Hey!
Do I look like I need a babysitter?
Sit down and shut up!
"Oh, shit."
Mr. President.
I..
NORAD is fully compromised.
Martin Walker now has the ability..
to launch missiles at any target in the United States.
Our satellites show massive troop movements..
"in Russia, Pakistan and the Arabian Peninsula."
"What are your orders, sir?"
"I swear to you all, I swear.."
that we are not beaten yet.
We are not!
No.
General..
how soon can you execute an air strike on the White House?
Sir.
We can have Raptors on target in 10 minutes.
Then do it.
Let's go to work!
Sir..
"Carol, we have to end this."
We have to.
I'm not like him!
Then I'll be the one who break your ribs if you are!
- Break my ribs?
- Beat you hard!
How are you?
"Times without you, are my wonderful times!"
"Sounds like, you do miss me!"
"But, what can I do?"
Seems like I don't miss you!
"What you have just said, makes me even happier than knowing you are a love child!"
Nice ring!
- Is that from your boyfriend?
"- Yes, it is."
You the first to know.
Engagement ring.
So I should congratulate you guys!
When will you guys getting married?
Hurry up!
- I can't believe that he is still shy!
- That's not related!
- Wine...
- Wine...
Let's toast for Yawang!
- Toast!
- For what?
"An early wish to you and Xiaotian, for eternal happiness in marriage, and have a baby boy soon!"
Great!
Have a baby boy!
Drink it!
I want to go to the toilet.
Hurry!
Whay do you want?
Damien looks after me too.
"Right, I'm going to need copies of all the photos."
No way.
But I will promise not to use any that compromise your team.
I think you misunderstood me.
All photos now.
You do not publish until this is over.
You make no mention of my unit or personnel.
Or what?
You're going to kill me?
CRAWFORD:
I can't see her.
"Christ, there's a lot of them."
They'll be heading out soon once they've juiced themselves up for the night.
(SHOUTING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
That's him.
"That's the one we kill, no matter what."
(SPEAKING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
Why isn't he leaving with them?
She's in that hut.
She's in that hut with him.
MATAK:
"I trust you have been treated appropriately, Major Sinclair."
Yes.
Thank you.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Colonel Grant.
(GREETING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
"Sit, please."
It is a tragedy how things have turned out.
- Then let us work to resolve it.
"- Indeed, yes."
That poor woman.
Father?
Yes?
I have to confess that my feelings were very hurt last year at the flower show.
"Ah, yes."
I am extremely sorry about that.
No.
"No, not just by you."
"When I looked at Edie's flower arrangement,"
I realised mine would never be as good.
And I think I've been punishing her for that ever since.
That was very brave of you to say so.
"And God, I am sure, will forgive you."
Thank you.
"Thank you, Father."
"Now, I'll see you back at St Mary's."
I just pray to God we're not too late.
"Me too, George."
Father?
"Good Afternoon, Lady Felicia!"
"Good work, Sid!"
George!
Father.
"How are you, Henry?"
"Mr Lee, the good news is we've got your man."
"Well, woman."
It turns out Iris Lightman did this to you.
Popped into your shed first thing yesterday and slipped hemlock in your teacup.
The one thing I don't understand is why she's tried to fit up George here.
"I've never met the woman, Henry."
"Don't have any thoughts on it, do you?"
I saw her at the shed... ..this morning.
"The truck is full, we'll have to do another round."
I'm coming.
- Let's go.
He's a private patient of Dr. Gertel.
"He started taking one more Fusid a month ago, he's had three attacks in the past year and he's allergic to penicillin."
- Alright.
"There's a list of his medications in his pocket, so take a look at it."
Okay.
The name's Ben-Shmuel?
"- Yes, Yitzhak."
"He was here before, gave me those candies..."
Licorice.
His pulse is down.
"- Okay, hurry up."
What's going on?
- Stay here.
"I'll come back later, Daddy."
It's okay.
I promise I'll come back.
Hey.
Are you moving in?
"It's a nice building, the neighbors downstairs are cool, so are the ones on the top floor."
"If you need anything, I live right here, just say the word."
What's your name?
Goni.
- I'm Sharon.
"Okay, bye, Goni."
- Bye.
"Life goes on, as the cliche goes."
There's a murder every 3 days and a robbery every hour
We'll arrive precisely on time
"Precisely, not approximately"
"No, I'm not going to force my opinion on you."
Because no one has the right to control another person.
"Hey, medicine seller."
How did today's wedding go?
"Come here, come here."
"Cat, cat."
Come this way.
"Come here, come here."
No one else has come out since you went in.
Hmm no.
(female announcer) Previously on Angela's Eyes...
Where's the box?
What box?
(Angela) The Anderson family time capsule.
"Oh, you mean that thing that we buried with Mom and Dad when we were kids?"
"I came here to, uh, to wish you a happy birthday."
"Great, you act like this is a birthday present."
This is our family time capsule.
"This is a clue, Ang."
"You know, I could never keep track of how many shirts were at the cleaner's."
Maybe you should check.
See if I left any there.
Oh.
"[laughing] Oh, my gosh."
Are you kidding me?
Angela got some papers from an old Korean cleaner.
They're in a bright red folder.
And I want them.
"What the hell are you doing, Dylan?"
Nothing.
"Cut the crap, dog."
There were three parts to the will.
Mr. Malhotra donated a huge sum to many charities... one million Euro to his staff and everything else to Tisha.
But that will was burnt.
"Which means, according to the law..."
Mr. Malhotra died without a valid will.
"And that means... his only heir, inherits all his wealth."
Tisha gets everything.
Correct.
How much exactly is everything?
10 billion Euro.
"Sia, it's Tisha."
She tried to kill herself this morning.
She did what?
"Attempted suicide, sir."
She's at St. Marks' hospital right now.
What the bloody hell is going on?
"Sia, you go to the hospital."
I'll meet you at HQ later.
Let's go.
"I'm sorry, but I need to question Tisha."
"- Any problem, officer?"
- No.
It's just routine.
I'll wait.
Dad...
"That's fine, thank you."
"Tisha, what happened?"
I...
I...
I don't know.
Why did you try to kill yourself?
What?
"Fine, okay."
"Sia, you won't believe it."
There was a call from the local police station.
Vikram Kapoor called the police to confess that he killed Maya.
What?
!
Just 70 rupees.
The latest from Bollywood.
August 22nd.
- He is dead.
Vikram didn't confess voluntarily.
He was forced to.
How does Neil figure in this?
"Sunil, who is the only one to have skipped surveillance?"
"Yes, sir."
"Where are you, Sia?"
"Mumbai, sir."
Vikram Kapoor is dead.
He was found in his house with slashed wrists... but his body has severe signs of violence.
"Sir, Neil Menon is on a killing spree."
Eliminating all the witnesses from that weekend.
Did I not give you a direct order to drop that case?
And to drop Neil Menon.
"Sir, if you could just listen to me."
"No, you listen to me."
I want you off that case.
Right now.
I will see you in my office tomorrow.
Sir...
"Sir, if someone in our department... is protecting Neil Menon..."
"That will be enough, Ms. Agnihotri."
What?
No soldiers or militiamen.
- And the people who live here?
- They've fled.
The bastards' last visit must have convinced them to find a better place.
I'm picking up radio messages about troop movement along the border.
All right.
Drive on.
- I'm sorry that we have to say goodbye now.
- We'll meet again.
"- Goodbye, Mariá."
- Goodbye.
- Come on.
- I want to stay with Mariá.
No.
You're going with Padre Julio.
You're staying with him for a while.
"As soon as this war is over, we'll be together again."
I promise.
"Come on, Pablito."
- Goodbye.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
- Don't drink so much Communion wine.
- We have a lot to do.
- It might be a small regiment.
They get scared when you say boo!
They're cowards.
Something must have happened.
They were talking about Ramírez.
It must be important.
Listen for as long as you can.
See you at the pass.
"This gun, found it from him."
"I think it's English, Chinese, Sir!"
But it looks like English.
Papa!
"Don't talk to him, he asked much questions,"
Sit!
Where do I sit?
On sofa or chair?
"On chair, There are lot of chairs,"
"Which chair, left or right?"
Lefts one.
Sir your left or mine?
"My metric's question paper, here."
"Here, on this chair."
"Really, you're such a daring man,"
"Thank you Sir, You come straight here."
"If I called you then you won't come, You were busy that's why I came her,"
"Anyway Sir, Shall we finish the work,"
Sorry Sir!
"Don't get me wrong, I am in hurry."
"I have to finish one more job,"
Mean?
"After finish my job, you'll go to finish for another job."
"Sometimes, I have to finish 5-6 jobs, I am kind of busy for 24 hours."
Marveles!
"Learn some, learn some, learn some thing from him."
Learn!
Learn!
"Excuse me, Sir!"
"Excuse me, Sir!"
Learn!
You beat us every time to the front of anyone.
He used to scramble around like a goddamn maniac.
Doug flutie?
He's the doug flutie of fire?
"That's funny, dad."
"Hey, flutie, where we you on 9/11?"
"Yeah, doug, where were you?"
"Don't give me that, you know,"
"""if only I knew that you were running into the second tower"" bullshit."
"I only ran in because-- well, because it was the next goddamn job."
"But you, i can't figure it out."
What were you waiting for?
Too much of a goddamn pussy to go in?
"First tower comes down, they're yelling, ""pull out!"
"Pull out!"""
"All I know is if you're a fireman and you ain't carrying someone else and you've still got 2 legs and 2 goddamn feet, you move on to the next goddamn job."
"Doug flutie, my ass."
Doug flutie would have run in.
"No balls, tom."
No balls at all.
"- I was looking for you, asshole."
"- Why, huh?"
- Jesus christ.
- Holy shit.
Don't tell me you were afraid.
- What?
- He was afraid.
- I was worried.
- About what?
- You.
- Me?
"600, 700 fire fighters in there."
Thousands of other people needing to be rescued.
Find Mrs. Cole!
I need to talk to Mrs. Cole.
Mrs. Cole!
Has anyone seen Mrs. Cole?
- Come on before they find us.
- Where?
I don't know.
I never come to the studio.
Mrs. Cole!
The boss wants to try a take without Uncle Frank's lines 'cause he says we are losing visual tension.
"Mr. Hilliard is talking about the integrity of the story, saying he will play the scene as you wrote it or not at all."
- Nobody's had any sleep and you're just--
- It's all right.
I'm coming.
No.
Let me deal with it.
"Once Hilliard gets his hands on you, he won't let you go for hours, and I was rather hoping to do that myself."
"Careful of big boy,"
- it's got a bit of a wobble on it.
Don't-
- Don't lean against it.
- Whoa!
Nobody move!
- Buckley!
"Nobody move, stay exactly where you are until we have some lights in here."
Stay where you are.
Back.
"Back, please."
Everybody get back.
Please take the girls away from the stage.
"Mr. Brown, please take them away."
Almost dawn.
"Die, you sucking pervert!"
"Dr. Corday, hi."
We need some Haldol here!
- You think that's necessary?
- Yes!
"Doctor C, looking good."
"Thanks, Malik."
"So, what's the GCS on this motorcycle trauma?"
"- Sorry, I didn't do the ride."
- Oh.
"Well, have the X-ray tech..."
- ... come down for portables.
- You got it.
- Hold the CT till we eyeball the patient.
"- Hey, welcome back."
Thanks.
So do you know any of the specifics?
"Sixteen-year-old girl, motorcycle versus utility pole, no helmet."
Carter's bringing her in.
- What's a chick doing on a motorcycle?
- What's anyone doing on a motorcycle?
"Have the rapid infuser primed and ready, draw her up 100 of fent four of Ativan."
Make sure the airway drugs are out of the box.
- It's like you never left.
- Yeah.
Vital sign.
- We need some O-neg.
- She got a rhythm?
- P. E.A. to agonal before arrival.
- Decreased breath sounds.
Intubated for agonal resps.
Didn't know you were back.
Right?
What?
Already expended it?
Just got 30 acres of vineyard.
Wine?
Yes.
"If I can make it, I'll send you some."
"That, will be a pleasure."
If we make through alive...
Today we will only look for garbage again?
"Bring a basket, a sandwich or something..."
It's like going hiking...
In a bleak place though....
A farewell to Arms ( Buki Yo Saraba )
Nice catch.
The UAV is back!
The camera!
The camera!
Prepare that one for the next launch.
Yes!
"Yankee, good job."
Under control.
Report status?
Arriving in about 5 minutes.
Before arrival we will launch an UAV.
Understood...
"About that protective suits... no matter how you look it, look awfully hot."
"It comes with aircon, you know."
You fool.
Look at the monitor.
"Take a look before you drop, idiot!"
I was looking down...
-Your town;
-My town.
"-Oh, maybe you'll do, huh, colonel;"
"Well, it's the same old place, same...."
-l'm gonna leave you here.
-Where are you going;
At Charley's.
Cards are pretty hot for me today.
You better not get fresh with Charley.
He can teach you.
Yeah;
"Charley said you were pretty good at cards, but I was better."
I can take Charley the best day he ever lived with you standing on his shoulders.
"Try it any time you say, colonel."
Any time at all.
I'll bet the women spoil him silly.
-Yeah.
"-Not only the women, either."
Jeff says he can charm the gold out of your teeth.
"How is Jeff, Papa;"
"Well, he's like everything else around here, lost his bite."
JEFF:
Not much like the nightgown you wore when I put you to bed.
"-Oh, Jeff."
"-Ha, ha."
How do you like the way I fixed up your room;
"-Oh, it's beautiful."
"-ls it, though;"
Got my idea from one them magazines.
"-Well, if you want anything, yell."
"-Oh, don't go, I wanna talk to you."
-l wanna know about Brock.
"You'd think if it had been anybody else's dog,"
It'd have barked or done something.
"My god, the dog's a monster who must weigh 125 pounds."
"Boy, I'll tell you, I wouldn't want to try to strangle anybody"
With that critter around.
No one saw or heard anything?
"Uh, nothing."
It was a total blank.
And the guy was by myself for only three minutes or less.
We timed the trip back to the tennis court.
"Doc, are you absolutely sure he was strangled?"
You want to come see for yourself?
"Oh, no, no."
There is another thing.
The victim apparently fought back.
How is that?
The knuckles on his right hand were bloody.
"OK, Doc."
This one I've got to see for myself.
Let's go.
[Cat meowing]
HESTER:
"Well, young man?"
RICHARD:
"Oh, yes."
Ms. Ramsey.
I was just looking for...
HESTER:
Snooping around?
"Uh, spying, I believe they call it."
"No, ma'am."
Nothing like that.
[chuckles] i knew the future looked bright.
i knew it.
- yeah.
"[clicks tongue] they didn't get along so well after, you know, the incident with... little tim."
- what happened with tim?
- [sighs]
"- hey, hey!"
what happened to tim?
- oh. oh. oh.
"so suddenly you care about tim, huh?"
- i've always cared about peepers!
- [sighs]
- what happened to my harley?
"- remember the phrase,"
"""i'd rather push a harley than ride a honda""?"
- yeah.
- that's for people who could afford them.
"you were too good to ride a honda, but too lazy to work to make the money to keep a harley."
"now, come on."
this is hurting me just as much as it hurts you.
- [sighs]
- makes me realize i was a bad mama.
"you never did learn how to cook, and wayne took to eating the pimento loaf at the dollar king all day long."
- dang.
wayne!
"[scoffs] wake up, you lard."
it's time for work!
- [sighs] it's christmas.
- so?
the dollar king ain't never closing!
- i quit.
- quit?
-Not with 10.2 million euro.
-Solenergi is the new oil.
They are doing groundbreaking research on nanocrystals.
They are close by cracking fourth generation code.
-It have I heard that before.
-I think it's worth checking.
"Leong, have I ever disappointed you?"
-I will send Degang.
"-No, I will go myself."
-I speak the language after all.
-Do you speak Norwegian?
"Yeah, I was born there."
-You have never told me.
You never asked.
All right.
Send me the numbers.
"And if I like them, you go in."
Do whatever you Vikings do.
-The press is waiting downstairs.
-Good.
I just want to coordinate a little with you first.
"I want us to tell them that we are dealing with new opportunities,  and we are optimistic."
"""Opportunities""?"
What the hell are you talking about?
You should not dictate what to say.
You do not get me juge.
"Of course not, Svein."
People are afraid. 300 men need to know what happens.
I know.
But I want them to find out from me.
Not read about it in the newspaper.
I beg you.
I don't like you!
Close cover before striking.
Close cover before striking.
My daddy told me never to play with matches.
My mummy told me never to play with matches.
"Oh, that's it."
He's gone too far.
"- I have to stop this, Al."
- Don't!
Ow!
There's someone here to see an Annabella Wilgis.
Annabella Wilgis?
- He's here!
"- Who's here, the killer?"
- He's coming.
- Sit down!
Who are you now?
"My name, young man, is Annabella Wilgis."
How dare you speak to me like that.
Here he is.
"Your interrogation of my client is over, Detective."
Your client?
"- Darren Russem, Ms Wilgis' lawyer."
- You're her lawyer!
- Miss Wilgis is not here voluntarily.
- She came in as a witness!
- Are you torturing my client?
- She came in voluntarily!
You don't seem to understand the scope of my client's disorder.
She asked you to meet her here?
You called ahead because you knew you'd need a lawyer?
"Five minutes, that's all I need."
I see eight Rolex boxes.
The guy's got two arms and eight Rolexes?
"Two arms, eight Rolexes and one safe he didn't use."
Genius.
Actor.
I remember running to the door and falling on the ground.
"And thinking,"
"""Why isn't Colin here?"
"""He should be here."""
Do you know where he was?
It's not like I know her name.
Got a friend you can stay with?
No.
I'm just the girlfriend from back home.
So I left The Edison with a buddy around 1:00.
And I just passed out back at his place.
His name?
What does that matter?
So I can confirm your whereabouts.
"Hey, come on, man, you can't actually think that I would..."
That's why I need his name.
Look...
I love Miranda.
All right.
Give me her name.
She's in the business.
I...
It wouldn't feel right to give you her name until my people talk to her people.
You do know I can ask anyone of a dozen photographers who you left The Edison with.
I didn't...
I didn't cheat on Miranda.
Colin cheated on Miranda with Chelsea Sennett.
"Clark, Cline, Clackey..."
"Culver, Jones, Charlie."
"Keep going right in, boys."
You boys are going to love the army.
-Elliot.
-Elliot.
Right.
"Hurry up in the back of the bus, all the way."
Nothing in this world is going to stop me from coming back.
"-I love you, Selena."
"-I love you, Ted."
"Hurry up, hurry up."
On the double.
"Let's go, boys!"
Cut them off.
"Hey, you!"
Snap it up.
"On the double, let's go."
"You know, you can write to her later on government stationary."
Good-bye.
Let's go!
"That first winter away from home, I took shape as an individual... and toughened."
With spring came the promise that perhaps I'd found my place in life.
But part of me would keepescaping.
"I'd find it running in memory back through Peyton Place's fields... orwandering down the streets, now emptied of young men."
I've got a couple of funny ones.
This is from Ted Carter.
He says:
"""The food they serve here must have been warmed over from World War I""!"
"-Oh, you remember Fred Cole."
"-Yes, I know him."
"He says: ""Dear Hyde, I joined the Navy because I liked the way... they kept their ships:"
Oh.
"He's very handsome, isn't he?"
I don't know.
He looks kind of hairy and slobbery to me.
Not that one.
The one playing the snarfblatt.
"Silence, silence."
"It is now my honor and privilege to present our esteemed Prince Eric with a very special, very expensive, very large birthday present."
"Ah, Grimsby, ya old beanpole, you shouldn't have."
- [Applause]
- I know.
"[Grimsby] Happy birthday, Eric."
[Gasping]
[Growls]
"Uh, gee, Grim..."
Ha!
[clears throat]
"It's, uh..."
It's really somethin'.
"Yes, I commissioned it myself."
"Of course, I had hoped it would be a wedding present."
"Come on, Grim."
Don't start.
You're not still sore because I didn't fall for the princess of Glowerhaven?
"Oh, my!"
"Oh, Eric, it isn't me alone."
The entire kingdom wants to see you happily settled with the right girl.
"Oh, she's out there somewhere."
I just...
I just haven't found her yet.
[Grimsby] Perhaps you haven't been looking hard enough.
"Believe me, Grim, when I find her, I'll know."
"- Well, it's about time."
Get me to that barricade.
"Thanks, Rocky."
This is Paige Grunion with Channel 17 Hard-core News.
I am coming to you live on the shoulder of the 5 Freeway.
And standing here with me are Will and Dale.
They are the drivers of the green monster van.
"- Tell me, gentlemen..."
- Monster truck.
Monster truck.
What possessed you to take such radical and desperate measures... to stop the BMWyourselves?
Oh!
Dude!
We are just doing our duty as Americans.
"Right, Will?"
That's right.
And that's not the first time we've had to take matters into our own hands.
"Mark my words, they'll be pulling over soon."
We really scared them.
Didn't we?
Didn't we?
- Did you see the look on their faces?
- Sure did.
- Whoa!
- And we'd be happy to tell anyone about it.
Anyone.
- Anytime!
- On-On Oprah.
Or Geraldo.
- Or SallyJesse.
Or any-any...
- Larry King.
I protect my sources.
That's why I'm here talking to you.
I want to protect him.
Why were you not arrested also?
"Nobody knew I was there, just taking photos."
Damien looks after me too.
"Right, I'm gonna need copies of all the photos."
No way.
But I will promise not to use any that compromise your team.
I think you misunderstood me.
"All photos, now."
You do not publish until this is over.
You make no mention of my unit or personnel.
(LAUGHING) Or what?
You gonna kill me?
Mmm-hmm.
(YELLING IN DISTANCE)
CRAWFORD:
I can't see her.
"Christ, there's a lot of them."
We're heading out soon.
Once they've juiced themselves up for the night.
(YELLING IN ARABIC) (GUNSHOTS FIRING)
That's him.
"That's the one we kill, no matter what."
(CONTINUES YELLING IN ARABIC)

(YELLING)
Why isn't he leaving with them?
She's in that hut.
She's in that hut with him.
"I trust you have been treated appropriately, Major Sinclair."
"-What's she got, anyway?"
"She's afflicted with a complaint, you know, a female-dog type of thing."
What's the full-court press on Santini about?
They got mail service now.
-What did you get off toxicology?
-This girl was a suicide.
"Trace amounts of narcotics in her system, not enough to stupefy anyone..."
... letaloneajunkie.
She pulled the bag over her head.
"Otherwise, we'd have found signs of struggle, resistance."
-The mutt from her apartment?
-Yeah.
-She's as much of a mess as that girl.
"-Hey, you ain't exactly Clark Gable."
"-John, what did the M.E. say?"
"-Suicide, Mike."
"-l told you I was clean, right?"
"-Yeah, you did."
"That's right, I did."
"Yeah, squeaky clean, Roberts."
LAURA:
"Yeah, thanks, I'll see you upstairs."
"Hey, congratulations on that Garcia homicide."
-Thanks.
-Yeah.
I was flat wrong about that.
-l didn't have my crystal ball.
-You were dead right.
"Yeah, well, I'm glad it worked out."
Nice job.
Thank you.
-Think that got you out of the woods?
Help!
"Over here, Indy!"
Get out of the way!
Move!
Move it!
Help me!
You can't do this to me!
I'm an American!

Marion...
Dr. Jones.
You looking for me?
Belloq.
"Good afternoon, Dr. Jones."
I ought to kill you right now.
Not a very private place for a murder.
"Well, these Arabs don't care if we kill each other."
They're not going to interfere in our business.
It was not I who brought the girl into this business.
"Please, sit down before you fall down."
We can at least behave like civilized people.
I see your taste in friends remains consistent.
"How odd that it should end this way for us, after so many stimulating encounters."
I almost regret it.
Where shall I find a new adversary so close to my own level?
Try the local sewer.
You and I are very much alike.
"Come on, I'm your older brother."
Ask me.
"Okay, big brother."
Which one would make your best friend want to do your little sister?
The red one.
Hey.
"I know you're depressed, so I brought someone to cheer you up."
"Right outside is a real, live, furry playmate."
I'm not sleeping with your friend Jane again.
"Hey, a dog!"
"Who, you gotta admit, looks a lot like Jane."
He's the happiest dog ever.
I borrowed him from my friend Wendy.
So you can keep him till he cheers you up.
I borrow him myself from time to time..
when I get depressed thinking about..
"world hunger, poverty.."
Not to trivialize your pain.
"Thanks so much, Pheebs."
We are gonna have so much fun!
"Oh, not that kind of fun."
Happy Valentine's!
I'm slipping into something a bit less comfortable and a bit more slutty.
"""Candy and Cookie""?"
Monica got me porn?
Girl-on-girl porn?
!
She really must love me!
"-Yeah, just relax."
"-I love you, St. Valentine."
"Whoa, whoa, that's not pretty."
Now push!
I give you a toast.
The Confederacy.
"You don't seem very happy over our victory, Mr. Campbell."
He's not.
He wants to kill all the Yankees himself.
[laughter]
- Sounds like a Kentuckian.
- We're all from Kentucky.
"You'll find plenty of action later on, sir."
"But before you go any further South, there's one thing we must teach you."
What's that?
Dixie.
- Sing it.
- May I?
[Innkeeper] Go right ahead.
"Come on, boys, gather 'round."
"♪ Oh, I wish I was in the land of cotton Old times there are not forgotten ?"
"♪ Look away, look away Look away, Dixie Land ?"
♪ In Dixie Land where I was born In early on one frosty morn ?
"♪ Look away, look away Look away, Dixie Land ?"
"♪ Then I wish I was in Dixie Away, away ?"
♪ In Dixie Land I'll take my stand To live and die in Dixie ?
"♪ Away, away Away down south in Dixie ?"
"♪ Away, away Away down south in Dixie ?"
"♪ Away, away... ?"

Away down south in Dixie ?
"Mr. Campbell, do you have something on your mind?"
I wanna know just one thing.
Do we have to be better Southerners than the Johnny Rebs themselves?
I went pretty far tonight.
But let me tell you this:
Do you really love him?
"He""s my family."
I just want my family back.
Then go home.
Go home and close your eyes.
This will all play itself out.
"But, Bobbi..."
"There""s nothing I can find out that""s gonna make you feel better."
Knowing the truth will only hurt.
And hurt and hurt some more.
"You""ll end up back where you are... which is still in love with the man you married."
Go home.
"I can""t."
"Get some rest now, Clara, okay?"
"L""ll call you first thing in the morning with my report."
"- Can""t you call me tonight?"
"- Okay, tonight after the dinner."
"Amy, you take her home."
Stay there until you hear from me.
"- No, I""ll call you."
"- No, Clara, you won""t."
"No communication with me when I""m on the job."
"No interference of any kind, or we back off the investigation entirely."
"It""s for our own protection."
Catching somebody in the act of cheating...
"- Well, things can get complicated."
- We understand.
- Thank you.
- Go home.
- Thank you so much.
"- You""re welcome."
"It""s not that simple, Jesse."
It ain't worth it.
I'd have done it for a tanner.
(Laughs)
Your moustache...
"Oh, yes, sir."
"I got the creeping alopecia, sir."
"It crept all over my lip, it did, sir."
"Yes, sir."
- Fetch Mrs Ransom.
"- Yes, sir."
I'm sure Mrs Ransom was after local colour for one of her romances.
Local colour is one thing.
Asking a publican for a Mickey Finn is another.
- I don't know Mr Finn.
"- Knock-out drops, sir."
Drugs.
"Oh, my goodness!"
"Then hurling abuse at a police officer, and giving a false name."
"- ""Lotus Blossom."""
- Good gracious.

"- Oh, never."
"No, Mumsie is totally teetotal."
"She was on port and lemon tonight, miss."
"Well, I'm sure she's very sorry indeed."
She's been under stress...
I shall write to my MP!
"You haven't heard the last of this, not by a long chalk!"
- Flora!
- Sit down.
Masquerading as civilians.
That oaf who arrested me hadn't even shaved!
- You mean the Veterinarian man?
"- Yeah, that guy."
I don't get it.
He sleeps with his patients.
His patients are probably cats and dogs and llamas and stuff
Why is that funny?
Back home we've puppy dogs and kitty cats.
I used to nap with all the time.
I think it's sweet.
"Actually, don't worry about it partner, there are plenty of other jokes in the universe we can share."
Let's just get ready for tonight.
Some well deserved vacation.

"It pardons, I have been mistaken."

-The sister of whom?
-Of the Left-handed person.
The Left-handed person...

Can't remember.
[Radio]:
By the obligations assumed at the Carno.
"He's so young, isn't he?"
"Yes, he is."
I think we can eat.
I'll take Andrea's tray up.
Perhaps he might want to try coming downstairs.
"Oh, no."
It's far too early for that.
I hope he's gonna like it.
"They look so sad, don't they?"
Not at all.
Don't eat too quickly.
Hmm?
Doesn't matter.
"It's very filling, isn't it?"
"You don't have to eat it, Ursula."
I'm sure Andrea will eat what you can't manage.
Perhaps I'll eat later.
He might like some of my bottled pears.
You didn't do anything.
You just freaked out and had a fucking seizure! rambling on like a lunatic.
So much easier for you.
Easier?
Jesus!

I'm such a giant disappointment.
You honestly derive no sense of purpose from what we're doing?

Hmm?
There is a young mutant sitting in our car.
I see that.

Does that mean nothing to you?

Mm-hmm.
"But i googled him afterwards, and..."
We met in a bar.
"He was funny and sexy,"
And we were both pleasantly drunk.
We got a hotel room that overlooked the ocean.
It was beautiful and romantic.
"Ahem, and then he..."
Changed.
What do you mean he changed?
He became extremely aggressive.
It was like he was operating
Some piece of machinery or something.
It was just so rote.
"I tried to resist, but..."
He was way bigger than i was.
I eventually just stopped resisting because...
Very good.

"Usually I just tell a woman it's over, hop on a plane, and suddenly she's the TSA's problem."
I could help you.
"Uh, okay, so you've broken up with tons of girls?"
[chuckles]:
No.
They've broken up with me.
I know more about break-ups than anyone except Taylor Swift and every person she has ever dated.
"I've been dumped by nine women, and I've only dated five of them."
"Wait, wait, so four strangers just walked up to you and said, ""It's over""?"
One of them was on a bike.
Calvin.
"-Well, not precisely a man."
"Hello, detective."
How is your investigation coming?
-I thought you were dead.
"-Technically, I was never alive."
But I appreciate your concern.
I made a switch.
It was an unprocessed NS-5.
"Basically, I fried an empty shell."
-I couldn't destroy him.
He was too--
-Unique.
It just didn't feel right.
You and your feelings.
"They just run you, don't they?"
"Two thousand eight hundred and eighty steps, detective."
"Do me a favor, keep that kind of shit to yourself."
No guards.
The override is disabled.
Robertson wasn't controlling them from here.
He wasn't controlling them at all.
"Oh, my God."
"You were right, doc."
I am the dumbest dumb person on the face of the earth.
Who else had access to the uplink?
Who could manipulate the robots?
Use USR systems to make Lanning's life a prison?
Poor old man.
He saw what was coming.
He knew no one would believe him.
So he had to lay down a plan.
A place to return to.
"""I'm home."""
"Yes, ""I'm home."""
Welcome home.
Two days ago we got a transfer request.
A graduate of the shaolin school of martial Arts.
currently a member of the lacrosse team.
The team requested permission to join the league.
apparently they have a new coach.
The beach volley team requests permission for an overseas tour.
Destination:
Australia.
First kneel down.
Hold the stick at an angle of 45to your body.
"Then, with one smooth movement..."
Don't rely just on force.
flow like water.
"Rin, this is fun!"
These are the basics of Shaolin Kung Fu.
Come for a sec.
What?
Standing Zen!
Don't do anything.
Alright!
The arms extend from the shoulder blades.
The force ejects the ball like a bullet.
The lower body is also important.
Its muscles control the speed.
This is Kung Fu.
"Alright, Minmin."
Give it a try.
OK.
"Hendricks is in hospital, Andre and the others are dead, so let's not fuck up anymore."
- And who are you?
- I'm Mr Crawford's CEO.
The code word for this is Scylla and Charybdis.
"Now move it, soldier, we have a package to collect."
"Go, guys."
"Crawford, wake up."
Look.
Government troops.
Army checkpoint.
"Well, that's good, isn't it?"
"I'll name drop Matak, we'll get an escort back to Khartoum."
- What?
- I don't know.
- What are they doing out here?
- Patrolling?
Who cares?
Maybe Matak has them looking for us.
Christ knows I've paid him enough.
"Matak set you up before, remember?"
And your men tried to kill him at the exchange.
Maybe he just wants to return the favour?
"I say we find a different route, just to be safe."
(SPEAKING IN SUDANESE ARABIC)
- What's he saying?
- Janjaweed.
Two jeeps.
Coming fast.
We press on.
We hit that checkpoint.
"If the soldiers are friendly, we'll have more firepower against the Janjaweed."
"Crawford, you drive, take it slow, but get ready to gun it on my command."
-You're a fine one to ask me how it went.
-blanche.
You're a fine one to stand there accusing me of it.
-I won't stay in this house.
-blanche!
-blanche.
"-I, I, I took the blows on my face and my body."
"AII of those deaths, the Iong parade to the graveyard."
"Father, Mother, Margaret, that dreadful way...."
"You just came home in time for funerals, stella."
And funerals are pretty compared to deaths.
How do you think all that sickness and dying was paid for?
"Death is expensive, Miss stella."
"And I, with my pitiful salary at the school...."
"Yes, accuse me."
"Stand there and stare at me, thinking I let the place go."
I let the place go?
Where were you?
-In there with your PoIack.
"-blanche, be still."
That's enough.
-stella.
"stella, you're crying?"
-Does that surprise you?
"Mitch, we gonna play at your house tomorrow?"
"No, not at my house."
My mother's still sick.
"-AII right, you bring the beer."
-Break it up down there.
-I made that spaghetti dish and ate it myself.
"-Now, honey, I told you and told you we were playing Jack's beer."
What's so funny?

"Well, unexplained things, secrets, occurrences that we're really not supposed to talk about?"
Oh.
Well...
"I believe that there are moments, experiences that someone like McGee, with his trusty computer, couldn't justify."
"When Gibbs left tonight,"
I... thought I saw it again.
Saw what?
The bounce.
"You know, I've been thinking about that."
Boss don't bounce.
"You cannot expect a person to keep things bottled up inside forever, can you?"
RYAN:
"Mm, charades."
Let's play.
Now?
(snorts)
It's as good a time as any.
(chuckles)
No.
Why not?
"Because I don't play games, Doc."
(laughs)
Like hell you don't.
"You know, people keep looking at their watch, usually means they're worried about something."
You got to run?
"Oh, I've been running."
Maybe it's time you stopped?
I wish I could.
You can.
Parker can.
You have no idea.
To the cemetary.
Your brother's grave.
My dead brother is not the problem.
Your mother is.
She might be dropping by just to say hello.
Mothers are like that.
So we're gonna go stake out a cemetary?
Until you come over with something better.
A.D.E.
What?
- After Death Experience...
- I know what it is.
My mom had one when I turned her.
Which means she saw you being turned.
By Marcus.
At the House of Chthon.
She's probably looking for me there.
"Please, please help me!"
I need to see my daughter.
I...
"Sorry, sir."
She came out of nowhere.
Not a problem.
Happens from time to time.
Is she?
Infected...
"Lane, this is Leon."
I've got a stray in the lobby who needs an immediate transportation to disposal.
"Ma'am, if you'd like to accompany these gentlemen through that door,"
I'll see to it that you receive all the attention you deserve.
"I want my daughter, where is my daughter?"
"Ma'am, we're gonna take care of you."
There's a pube right there.
I did that to trick you.
That's 100 percent beef you're staring at.
"Wait, why not just play rock paper scissors?"
"What are we, fucking ten?"

Did he at times use an alias that was known in certain circles as Godfather?
Godfather is a term used by his friends.
One of affection and respect.
"Mr. Chairman, I would Iike to verify the witness' statement."
For years many of my constituents have been of italian descent.
I've come to know them well.
They have honored me with their support and their friendship.
- How long will you be gone?
- At least till nighttime.
Nice.
Hello Miss.
I just wanted to deliver you a message from our friend Biberkopf:
He'll be home late.
Did he order you to do that?
Not exactly.
But I thought I might as well just see you and settle over what happened last night.
- Just what do you want?
- I already told you.
And there is nothing wrong visiting a beautiful young lady.
Nothing wrong with that?
It's a nice day and we will drive a bit around.
- Franz will join us!
- Franz?
Yes!
He'll meet us in the evening.
You know that we are friends.
Allright.
"It's an opportunity to have a talk with you, about Franz."
- Fine.
- Where is he?
"Freienwalde, Plumber-Karl is helping us out."
You wanted to tell me about Franz.
You've known him for quite a while.
I could talk for hours.
Great guy.
- A little weak but...
- Last night he cried in the hallway.
- What?
- He doesn't wanna go on like this.

"So, what are we talking about?"
"Maybe she was a good teacher when she was younger,"
"But now that she's older, she just doesn't care anymore."
Yeah.
"I'm a lot younger than her,"
And I don't really care anymore.
"She's jaded and burned-out, and the last thing"
"She should be doing is teaching kids that young,"
But does the school system care
That she is creating a hostile learning environment?
"No, because the school system is broken, mike!"
It's broken.
You're right.
Somebody should do something.
They should.
Where you going?
Bed.
But we're in the middle of a conversation.
Really?
I was at the end.
Night.
"Well, maybe mike could turn it off,"
"But I was too worked up to sleep,"
So I called my sister...
"I mean, when a kid as smart as Brick gets a d-minus,"
Something's wrong.
I called my mom...
"When a kid as smart as Brick gets a d-minus,"
Something's wrong.
"And at 3:00 in the morning, I'd had enough talk."
Hey.
What are you doing up so early?
I never came to bed.
"No, I really think that it would be good for me to know why you cannot live without this other woman."
"Well, we'd been together since college and she gave me an ultimatum."
"She said, ""Either we get married or we break up."""
So we got married.
Wow.
You caved.
It's complicated.
Really?
What?
You're a dick if you date a girl for too long and don't marry her.
You marry her and you're an asshole for marrying before you're ready.
"I mean, shit, I don't know."
[SIGHS]
You're really hot.
And I am obviously attracted to you.
So I think the best I can do is eventually find this piece of paper and call you and hope to just help you out in your career in some small way.
Hi.
Hi.
What's going on?
[HAMMERING]
Javier.
"Javier, I thought we talked about tarping the furniture."

"Hi, this is Gigi."
Is Alex there?
Hold on.
- Alex?
- Yo.
- Drinks are good?
MAN:
"Yeah, one more."
Alright.
What do you got to drink around here?
You don't have much time.
Soon they will come to harm you.
And I will not be able to stop them.
Unless you are able to give me something to placate them.
Some... piece of information...
Which I can use to protect you from them.
I already told you everything I know.
I have no loyalty to Jones.
He's brought me nothing but trouble.
"Marion, you are beautiful."
I don't think we need a chaperon.
"Steadily, steadily."
"Down, down, carefully..."
You're all right Indy?
"Gently boys, gently, gently!"
I told you it would be all right!
"Sallah, get down here!"
You pour.
Oups!
What is this stuff René?
I grew up with this.
It's my family label.
"Well, I have to be going now René."
I like you René.
Very much.
Perhaps we meet someday under better circumstances.
We meet again freulin.
"You Americans, you're all the same."
Always overdressing for the wrong occasions.
Now...
You can't possibly be.
Yes.
The new owner of the Standish Tavern.
Banks are delighted to sell paper on imminent foreclosures.
Foreclosure?
You don't have to thank me.
I knew that you'd just about die with embarrassment.
I just dropped by to make final arrangements.
I can't leave without ensuring that my interests...
... arelookedafter by someone I can trust.
"Oh, no."
Never.
I will never work for you.
"Fine, if that's your attitude."
I'll find another bartender.
Bartender?
Then who's the manager?
I came. I saw. I conquered.
Wait.
Just tell me one thing.
Why?
Why here?
Why me?
"Somebody's got to keep you sharp, son."
We're business people.
And we're the best at what we do.
Don't ever forget that.
"Yes, indeed."
Previously on Vanished...
Jeffrey's home.
Please never call here again.
"Dad, you've already hung him up for one whole day"
Let me release him!
Stop!
Betraying one's school is a serious violation
"This bastard, I'll teach him a good lesson"
Dad!
You don't need to beg me on his behalf!
I've invited some leaders here... to discuss how to get rid of the Three Devils
I'll also take this chance to clear up our school!
Clear up our school?
"Master, you mean..."
I'll dispose him of all his vital energy
"In front of everybody, so as to show the world"
My sense of justice!
Dad!
Dad!
I'm so itchy
"3rd Brother, I need some water"
"I'm so dry, 3rd Brother!"
I need some water!
3rd Brother!
"Quick, I need a drink"
What?
Better say your last wish fast!
I'm so thirsty!
Give me some water!
"Water, sure!"
Let me give you the best soup in the world
It'll surely soothe you!
Come down!
I'm high up here.
If you don't let me down
"Andjunk, dope!"
And they leave the gambling to last.
I want to run my family without you on my back.
I want those Rosatos dead!
-No.
-Morte.
I have business that's important with Hyman Roth.
I don't want it disturbed.
Then you give your loyalty to a Jew before your own blood.
You know my father did business with Hyman Roth.
He respected him.
"Your father did business with Hyman Roth, he respected Hyman Roth, but he never trusted Hyman Roth or his Sicilian messenger boy, Johnny Ola."
You'll have to excuse me.
"I'm tired, and I'm a little drunk!"
"I want everybody here to know, there's not going to be no trouble from me!"
Don Corleone.
"Cicci, the door..."
You want him to leave now?
Let him go back to New York.
I've already made my plans.
The old man had too much wine.
It's late.
How's the baby?
-Sleeping inside me.
-Does it feel like a boy?
"Yes, it does, Michael."
Kay?
I'm sorry about all the people today.
Bad timing.
"It couldn't be helped, though."
It made me think of what you once told me.
""" In five years the Corleone family will be completely legitimate. """
"No, sir, it's from that solar system ahead."
Any interference?
Resistance?
"No, sir, just scanning beams."
It's on an unusual wavelength.
Mr. Spock?
It would appear someone is curious about us.
"Mr. Sulu, is the alien still heading away from that solar system?"
"Yes, sir."
"We're closing, sir."
"Lieutenant Uhura, anything further on those scanning beams?"
"There's no hostility, sir."
"They're not tractors or weapons of any sort, just increasing in intensity."
Steady.
Regular.
"It's growing stronger, sir."
- Captain!
"- Yes, what is it?"
"The alien, it's slowing down."
"Warp 5, 4, 2."
"It's going sublight, sir."
Sir...
- It stopped dead in space.
- He may be turning to fight.
"No, sir."
They're just dead out there.
Are you sure?
"Yes, sir."
Unmoving.
Then we've got him.
Go to red alert.
Prepare to fire phaser banks.
So get out.
See the world.
Learn some new things.
I don't want to disappoint Simon.
He raised me after my parents died.
Helped me earn my Ph.D.
And I owe him so much.
But sometimes he can be so...
Demanding?
Hm.
More like tyrannical.
Kelly...
It's your life.
It should be your decision.
I wish I had as much confidence in me as you do.
"I shouldn't admit this, but when we were in Thera,"
I had the most awful crush on you.
Me?
Really?
Perfect timing.
That's odd.
What?
"Well, the Ark of Solon was made around the 6th Century B.C., in Athens during the Iron Age."
"But according to this, the tool that dented it was made from tin, and judging by these trace elements, it came from the mines in Cornwall during pre-Roman times."
Cornwall?
Isn't that near Exeter?
Yes.
"Why, does it mean something?"
I'd better get to the academy.
May I go with you?
Yeah.
So why do you think your grandfather's so hostile about Atlantis?
- Course not.
What?
"If we mess this up, they will find you dead of an overdose and I'll be back in prison waiting for someone to stab me in the showers."
"Better hope he hasn't gone far, Calum."
Iain?
"What do you mean, a runner?"
"Just took off, all of a sudden."
- Find him for me.
- And then what?
Operation Merlin's all but dead and buried.
"I want him dealt with, John."
"And this time, no guns."
"- John, I've finally cracked it."
It's churros.
- What are you talking about?
The Spanish doughnuts you dip in hot chocolate after you've been out.
- Churros.
- Good.
"Once again last night, the wife got a call at 10:30."
- The husband saying good night.
- Exactly.
He's always calling.
They must like each other.
"We need to get in, get the phone number, without her knowing."
How?
We need a woman.
"Like Mr Ray Charles says, we've got a woman."
- You must be joking if you think...
- How many other birds do you know?
We meet again.
Thanks again for everything you did to help me.
"Oh, don't just thank me."
- I am listening.
"We are after talented musicians at schools, especially after Candan..."
- Ercetin's popularity.
- Yes.
And we have come across your thing your name.
"You are very kind, Mr. Ceyhan."
"Of course, we can meet."
Is it necessary to meet today?
"Well, right away if possible."
The studio is free at the moment.
We could do some recording...
My partners are here too.
"So, we could sign a contract too."
"Well, if you say today is necessary."
I am listening to you.
Then ...
let me give you the address.
"Okay, I am writing it down."
"It's IMC Bazaar, opposite Zeyrek, Bemol Records, Cevat Ceyhan."
Which bazaar did you say?
"Ma'am, it's the IMC Bazaar, opposite Zeyrek."
"There aren't any mistakes with the address, right?"
Of course not.
What kind of a mistake can there be?
"Alright, sir."
"So, that's your place."
Come on.
We are waiting for you.
My accent always works within the music sector.
"Oh God, my voice is gone."
God damn it.
Hello?
The cosmetics in the bathroom cupboard and the electric toothbrush.
The first time those items appeared round here was last January.
"We got together at a Christmas do, I semi-moved in the next month."
"So, where do you sleep every Tuesday night and alternate weekend?"
I kept my place on.
Expensive.
I want to keep my independence.
Really?
Is that true?
"I'm sorry, I really do need to get back."
Will you tell him that we met?
Will you?
Are you kidding?
It'd freak him out.
"Best both keep quiet, then."
Pretend like this never happened.
I like that plan.
"Oh, do me one favour?"
Anything.
Change those sheets.
What do you think about having them over?
Who?
The neighbours.
We could make it a thing.
"Drinks, nibbles."
Do we have to?
I think we should get to know them better.
Find out what they're really like.
"Morning, Mr Sellers."
"Good morning, Michael."
We're having everyone over ours Friday evening.
A few glasses of wine.
It was a Halloween party at our house.
"And I walked in on him and our neighbour, Mrs. Hector."
She was a rough-looking woman.
"Bus driver hair, gap tooth, cigarette."
Voice that could match a Muppet.
"Anyway, do you want to know what was in my happy meal?"
You want to know what prize I grew up with?
Being raised by a single mom.
You know what?
I don't need red hair today.
I don't need that
"- distraction, please."
"- Hey man, why are you freaking out?"
I'm not freaking out This isn't freaking out.
I'm being normal.
I just need everything to be perfect so I can surprise Candace.
- Ooh.
Surprise me how?
- What the hell.
"Sweetie, remember when we, uh, first met?"
Remember that song that was playing?
"- Yeah, of course."
- ♪ You are my fire ♪
♪ my one desire believe ♪
♪ when I say I want it that way ♪
- ♪ tell me why ♪ - ♪ ain't nothing but a heartache ♪
- ♪ tell me why ♪ - ♪ ain't nothing but a mistake ♪

That's so awesome!
What are the Backstreet Boys doing here?
We're in Detroit doing a fundraiser.
You are independent.
"It is your nature, not a malady."
You are dissatisfied because your life constrains you.
You say it so plainly.
I'm ashamed to seem ungrateful for what I have.
But I just want...
You just want to be free.
Exactly.
Hmm.
Thank you.

Roderick.
My darling sister.
You are a sight for sore eyes.
How are you?
Have you settled in nicely?
I have.
It's everything that we hoped it would be.
And how is the famous doctor?
The medication is helping already.
I...
I already feel much more at ease.
"Uh, little bird?"
Where'd you go?
I'm sorry.
"Dr. cairn says it's a part of the healing process, a side effect as I adjust to the medication."
"Well, perhaps some, uh, fresh air will help."
Would you like to take a walk?
Let's enjoy the beautiful gardens.
You lead the way.
Whoareyou?
I'mEdith.
There are two more crates outside.
Did you tell them?
"He knows, too?"
"You know, too?"
I'm done for.
- He wants to talk to you.
- Big deal.
Have you considered how he feels?
A guy raises three kids and 30 years later he finds out he's not their father.
"Stop being his lackey, Ricky."
It's his fault that my mom's dead.
"He paid the surgeon $3,000 under the table"
- to make sure she'd be okay.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- The Arab took a bribe.
- How do you know?
He told me-
- You believe all his 1001 Nights stories?
He's waiting outside.
Really?
Why doesn't he come in?
Natanel!
Wait!
Natanel!
See?
I told you not to come.
"""...beyond any blessing, song, praise or consolation"
"""uttered in this world, and let us say Amen."""
- Amen.

- Mr. President.
- Bob.
"I don't know whatto say, sir."
"As soon as we learned from the secretservice you were en route, the directorwas notified."
- He should be here any minute.
- Oh?
Where the hell is he?
"Uh, well, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir."
"So, let's go."
"He told me to take you to his conference room, sir."
"No, his office."
I wanta very private conversation with him.
- I don'twanna be bugged.
"- Then, his office will be fine, sir."
Okay.
Hi.
"How's the job going, Bob?"
"Frankly, itstinks, sir."
I have no access.
We'll see to that.
"He's nervous, sir."
He's heard you're looking for a new director.
He certainly isn'tacting like it.
That's Helms.
He's the epitome of Sangfroid.
Aworld-class poker player.
Yeah?
"Well, I own the fucking casino."
"I'm honored, Dick, thatyou've come all the way out here to Virginia... to visit us at last."
"- My friends call me ""Mr. President."""
- And so shall I.
How?
"Secondly, the Church, before it approves an exorcism conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted."
That takes time.
-You could do it yourself.
"-No, I couldn't."
"I'd need Church approval, and that's rarely given."
Could you see her?
"Yes, I could."
I could see her as a psychiatrist--
Not a psychiatrist!
She needs a priest!
She's seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you !
Are you gonna send me back to them?
"Jesus Christ, won't somebody help me?"
You don't understand--
Can't you help her?
Just help her!
It wants no straps.
"Hello, Regan."
I'm a friend of your mother's.
I'd like to help you.
"You might loosen these straps, then."
"I'm afraid you might hurt yourself, Regan."
I'm not Regan.
I see.
"Well, then, let's introduce ourselves."
I'm Damien Karras.
And I am the devil.
Now kindly undo these straps.
"If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?"
"That's much too vulgar a display of power, Karras."
Where's Regan?
"""without my Blue Ivy, girl."
"""'Cause I ain't trying to get leg burn."
"Boom, boom, hey!"""
"And, Black women, some of y'all do this."
What the hell is this?
It's like y'all trying to pull a conversation out the sky.
"You know like, ""Hey, my name's Tammy."
"""I work at Walgreens,"
"""and I make 7.25 an hour."
"Ain't nobody got time for that, hey."""
You seen this person before.
You be at the McDonald's.
"You be like, ""Excuse me."""
"Let me get a Big Mac, McChicken sandwich."""
"She come out with an attitude, just dancing."
"""Pshh, pshh, pshh, pshh!"
"""We ain't got no Big Macs, no McChicken sandwiches."
"""So Big Mac your ass out the front door."
"""Big Mac your ass out the front door."
"Surfboard, surfboard, graining on that wood."""
"Look at some of the white people like,"
"""Yeah, I fired somebody like that earlier this week."
"Won't have to worry about LaQuifa anymore."""
"White people and people in the corporate world,"
I love to see how y'all react to folks that come in the office with dreadlocks.
It's so funny.
'Cause y'all get nervous.
"As soon as you see 'em, you be..."
"""Uh..."
"Hello."""
"That means, ""What the hell are you doing here?"""
"""Uh..."
- I don't know.
I can't tell.
- How about your legs?
- No.
I can't feel them.
"Gallant, need a hand here."
We' re talking smithereens here!
Have you ever seen smithereens?
I'm on Psych rotation.
I really shouldn't be helping you.
"- Haleh, this is a dead body."
- You ought to go to med school.
Can't take her to the morgue yet.
We' re waiting on family.
Why am I not exploding?
No movement below the umbilicus.
What's wrong with me?
Why can't I feel anything?
You might have bruising to your spinal cord.
"I need 30 mgs per kilo of methylprednisolone, IV bolus."
- Where the hell's X-ray?
- Behind you.
Start with the chest.
- Please.
I need Ricky.
"- Stay with us, Alma."
"Entry wound, left mid-sternocleidomastoid with a large hematoma."
There's blood behind the ear as well.
Be nice to hear about that ultrasound.
Morrison's is dry.
The pericolic gutters look good.
- Bladder is-
But i ain't got the money to pay it.
Josie... nick... she's a gilt-edged corporation.
"Mr. Boyd, we can get through to the hospital now."
I got a carriage for the colonel.
"No, i don't want any carriage."
Got a golden chariot comin' for me.
I wonder if those gates are really made of gold.
"Right, then."
Go straight to the office...
Don't dawdle on the way
Don't worry
I'll call in 30 minutes to check
"Oh, hello Fujio"
"Is your mother here, too?"
Why are you outside?
It's no fun listening to women's talk
"Well, why don't we go in together?"
I'm fine out here
"Right, you wait out here"
Aunty!
Tell mom...
"If she's not out soon, I'm leaving!"
I'll tell her
Mrs. Ishino has arrived
Good
Welcome
Please come in
I hope you're well
Been here long?
A little while
"You're very pretty, today"
Average?
And speed and endurance of a questionable nature.
Shoot!
"Now there's no way this specimen could complete, let alone compete in, the Iron Man competition... unless..."
Let me guess.
"Well, unless what?"
"Your boy gets a first-class, knowledgeable, certified trainer to guide him to a winning body."
"Yeah, but where do I get that?"
"I mean, a dude like that's gotta cost big bucks."
"Not a dude, T.C."
"A ""dudette."" Am I right, Barbara?"
"Modestly, yes."
The pride of Bayonne.
The top instructor at the Firmer Body in Ten Days Figure Salon.
"And in return for my services, Magnum continues to search for Roger... and then runs the Iron Man to pay his debts to you."
Deal?
You got it.
No!
And a one and a two... and a three and a four.
And a one and a two... and a three and a four.
And breathe.
And a one and a two and a breathe.
"Good morning, Barbara."
Very subtle.
You're wasting your time.
I don't want to play.
"Oh, now, Magnum."
"Now, the secret here, you see, is knees to chest."
Knees to chest.
Try it.
Now...
"I am heading for a swim, and when I get back, Barbara..."
- Yes.
"""owns extensive properties in Cambridgeshire and Suffolk."""
"""Cedar Chase has been the family seat since the 17th century."""
"""The grounds..."""
"""include a private lake and several hundred acres of manageable land."""
"Bugger me, they're loaded."
What's this sudden obsession with money?
It's not like any of us are paupers.
"Well, El's father filed for bankruptcy over the summer."
Shit!
I'm so sorry.
"Doesn't buy you happiness though, right?"
"I mean, look at Mr. Gimp, case in point."
"Oh, he's all right."
He's kinda cute.
"In a sweaty, loser kind of way."
"Uh, I know he brings out the maternal in you girls or something, but honestly, I think..."
I think he's a creep.
"Oh, you should write that in his birthday card."
"Did, uh, you just use the word ""maternal"" to describe me?"

"If she hadn't crashed, she'd been gone anyway, so what's the diff?"
She might have come back?
"Well, we'll never know, will we?"
"So, spare me the pity party."
I am over it.
Morning.
Correct.
"So, that's it then?"
That's the story?
"Yeah, for now."
Because Big Mac doesn't want his family dirty laundry aired in public.
"Ah, no, because most of what people are saying is hearsay and we don't print hearsay, George."
But it just seems so...
Underwhelming?
Yes!
There is a life attached to that body.
"Well, not anymore, to be accurate."
"Which we are, George."
The facts.
"So, an unidentified woman..."
Which everyone knows is Trina!
She hasn't been formally identified yet.
"So, until then it is not a fact, it is gossip."
"We print news here, George."
News.
Siouxsie?
"Ah, Siouxsie, is Monty..."
"Right here, George."
"She's, er, processing her grief."
"Were her and Trina close, then?"
Not really.
Trina didn't really like kids.
And shut up.
"Right everyone, your work-experience placements have been finalised."
"And as 99% of you left it to the careers officer,"
I don't want to hear whingeing about where you're heading.
Sir.
There seems to be some mistake.
"Is the mistake you choosing to ignore me saying ""No whingeing""?"
"No, sir, it says here I'm going to work at a garage."
Yes.
Come on.
Me.
A garage?
- Does that seem likely?
- What's your point?
I wrote to the local paper.
To shadow a journalist there.
Maybe even write a few pieces myself.
"Right, let me have a look."
"I don't get paid extra for this, you know."
"OK, it says here that Sutherland is expected at the newspaper."
- Case closed.
"- Well, then there's clearly been some sort of mix-up."
I don't mean to be rude but  look at him.
- No offence.
- None taken.
"What was your first choice, Sutherland?"
Airplane driver.
- And that is...?
- Someone who drives planes.
- You mean a pilot.
- Do I?
- What was your second choice?
What's different about it?
There's nothing different about it.
You're just like your father.
So easy to trip up.
"- So, how was work?"
- Same as always.
Although I had one customer come in looking for a makeover.
She needed one.
"Dyed blonde hair, blue eye shadow, ash brown foundation."
Hideous.
"Anyway, she was shocked when she found out how old I was."
Oh.
How old were you?
Sorry.
I ran into Mr. Jenkins again.
He cornered me in the elevator.
He wants to take me to some Alzheimer's benefit.
I said forget it.
I can't believe he still asks you after all these years.
Why don't you go with him sometime?
"Please, those days are over."
I raised two daughters.
I buried a husband.
That's my life.
I have no interest in starting another one.
"Besides, he knows my situation with you."
You're not seeing him because of me?
How would it look?
"The mother's dating, and the daughter stays home alone."
"Mom, who's looking?"
Hello.
Hi.
He...
"He saved Roger, didn't he?"
Hey.
"Hey, the race is on."
"Oh, hey, man."
Spare me.
I don't want to look at no race.
I don't want to know nothing about no race.
Shh.
Today's running of the famed Iron Man Classic drew a record number of competitors.
"The big surprise of the event came in the last leg, the 100-mile bicycle portion, when a rider sponsored by Island Hoppers... suddenly reversed field as he exited the famed Austin Memorial Gardens."
"We've got some footage of that Island Hoppers biker, who certainly lived up to his sponsor's name."
"Whoever you are, Island Hopper, we admire your style."
Yeeha!
Look at...
And that's the news from all of us to all of you.
Good night.
ANGEL GUTS:
RED PORNO
There are perverts everywhere nowadays.
Hello?
Come on Nami.
You're my best friend.
"Do my shift tomorrow, please?"
I've got a date.
What job is it?
Can just anyone do it instead of you?
Yeah.
As long it's a woman.
It's very easy.
You just have to stand there doing nothing.
is that necessary?
Herman will see you've slept with me.
- ls he jealous?
- You better believe it.
- And where'll I sleep from now on?
- l'll show you.
He's staying all next week.
It'll give me lots of time for the treatment.
What'll you say about me?
That you're a writer in need of some peace.
He knows I'm a member of the Literature Club.
"Isn't it a bit perverse, Christine taking in two lovers at once?"
Perverse?
You're going to help me with Herman?
You care about as much for Herman as for me: not at all.
A great deal.
"Take the keys, so you can come and go as you like."
We'll be back late.
Bye...
Give Herman my regards.
"I will, and you start your novel!"
Drive carefully!
Chapter One
When I arrived at V. yesterday...
"Damn... I'm wearing your shirt, Johan!"
Home movies?
Johan.
Henk.
Gé?
"Snip, snip, snip..."
Do you take Christine to be your lawful wedded wife?
What is your reply?
- So sorry.
Uh.
- Hi!
"Oh, it's you."
All of the research I could've been doing while chasing this Will-o'- the-Wisp Psychiatrist.
"- So, you hit someone?"
- With my cane.
I struck him across his fat face.
- It was fatter than mine.
- Why?
He had a leg tremor and Nystagmus.
- That's abnormal eye movements.
So?
- It was obvious he was in the advanced stages of Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome.
I told him as much.
That's a neurological disease.
It's brought on by excessive alcohol consumption.
- She knows what it is!
"- I don't, actually."
"Well, you should, seeing the company you keep."
I-I still don't understand why you hit him.
He called me a nosy old Jew.
"Jew, yes."
"Old, perhaps."
"Nosy, never!"
"Ok, well, uh, good for you."
- What is that?
- That's a flight tracker app.
"He should be in the air by now, if he got on the plane."
"Makes you wanna dance, doesn't it?"
I am so sorry.
I feel like I've been in this car for four years.
- Your keys.
"- ls it just the keys or along with the keys, the car too?"
"Along with the car, the driver too is there."
I have never seen a flower selling flowers.
"Will you just see, or buy something too?"
I will buy all your flowers.
How much do they cost?
Around 4000.
Give me the address.
Where do I send it?
- Your name?
- Nisha.
I don't want flowers.
I am at fault.
And the flowers are being punished?
The flowers are being punished.
And you are sweating?
Here...wipe off your sweat!
- Sweat?
!
- Please take it.
"If I were in Baba's place, I would have picked up the girl..."
- ..and parceled her right away!
- l would say...
Let Baba just mention it once.
I will pick up her entire family!
How would you know what love is?
One should go straight to the girl and ask her...
'Will you give me a kiss?
Or shall I slit your throat?
'
Rascals!
- The truth.
- Why?
Because he could come back!
They've got a right to know.
- OK.
I'm coming with you.
- No.
- Let me take the blame.
- No!
"I got us into this, not you."
Although...
I'm in so much trouble
I think they might actually eat us.
I'll see you next time I'm allowed out.
Which is probably in the next 50 years or so.
You could leave them in the den till they promise not to punish you.
"Yeah, I might just do that."
You sure you don't want to split the blame?
- Positive.
- OK.
I'll see you in 50 years.
"I can smell you out there, young lady."
You are beyond grounded!
"Open this door, Maddy."
Open the door!
"You and Rhydian gave Tom and Shannon, a picture of you in wolf-form!"
What were you thinking?
"In some parts of America, wolves are protected."
I'm going to get our wolves protected too.
"If you want the Government to start passing laws to protect them, you need..."
- proof they actually do exist.
- I've got it!
"You are Erik Berg, right?"
Hello.
I know you.
- I work in the law.
- Oh well. in section two?

Addons It's time to play.
You killed an innocent man.

Addons I disagree.
Involve friends when you break the rules.

- Of course!
- What is your name?
"- Biberkopf, Franz."
- I'm Sonja.
- Are you from Poland?
"No, Bernau."
But then your name wouldn't be Sonja.
It is based on my appearance.
- Are you allright?
"- Yes, sort of."
"- You're not getting any pension, huh?"
"- Sometimes I get some, but not regularly."
Will you take me along?
"No, I'd better not."
What's the matter?
I'll take you along.

The thought had crossed my mind.

Ahh...
Sorry I'm late.
I found the druid's noch
On an ancient roman map.
And I brought you those crumpets
That you like from marks and spencer.
"Thank you, karen, you're an angel."
You owe me five quid.
The noch was a small hill
That was significant as a place
Of worship for druids
In wales 2000 years ago.
Especially important is the warning to avoid conversations with the demon.
"We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous."
He's a liar.
The demon is a liar.
-You're Mrs. MacNeil?
-Yes.
I'm Father Merrin.
Come in.
Thank you.
-Is Father Karras here?
-Yes.
He's here already.
"It's an honor to meet you, Father."
-Are you very tired?
-No.
"I'd like you to go quickly across to the Residence and gather up a cassock for myself two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water and your copy of The Roman Ritual."

Why?
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
"Would you like some brandy in that, Father?"
The doctors say I shouldn't.
But thank God my will is weak.
He will lie to confuse us.
But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us.
"The attack is psychological, Damien."
And powerful.
So don't listen.
Remember that.
What happened all of a sudden?
I'm scared.
"I'm afraid of losing you, too."
But you're doing all you can to lose me.
Doborobon.
I was waiting for you.
- They released me.
- Isn't it too soon?
"Yes, but I insisted."
"Goodbye, Donna."
- What did you find?
- Nothing.
Did you speak to him?
What did he say?
Nothing.
"I just remembered how you once told me,"
"""Doborobon, it's a shame that your life is like water."
"""Clear, tasteless and odorless."
Change a little.
"Surprise yourself."""
But I never believed in that.
"People never really change, Mom."
They just start lying to themselves.
"You can go now, Morn."
I promise I won't bother you any more.
I just wish you could come here for a moment and explain to us why you did all this.
"Well, now I'm in your house."
I have a lot of spare time so I'm pondering.
I'll probably understand something in the end.

"Kiersten, where's Tony?"
[Kiersten] He's at the Mexican restaurant.
[Rossi] Is someone around him?
"Yes, uh, but I can't really make out his face."
What about his body?
Is it young?
Is it old?
"Uh, 25 maybe."
Wait.
He's wearing a mask.
- Like the kid?
"- No, no, no, no, no."
It only covers one side of his face.
"His ear is gone, and, um..."
[Rossi] What do you see?
It's a black guy.
He's black.
You make him sound like he's Freddy Krueger or something.
"No, but I do think he's severely burned."
Explains why he chooses this time of the year.
- He doesn't have to hide his scars.
- What about his victims?
He's punishing them for wronging him.
[Garner] Wronging him?
What about his second victim?
Have you looked at Josephine Davis' life?
She was the nicest woman in the world.
How did she wrong this guy?
"He's had interactions with all of his victims, some more personal than others."
So he's acting out of revenge.
Kiersten and Tony didn't even speak to him.
"Maybe not that night, but at some point in the past."
We got to get going.
Right.
Okay.
"Then later, at a club in Chinatown somehow located beneath a manhole cover, it got weird."
"God, I just love those tiny gray hairs in your eyebrows."
Old men are so sexy.
"All right, to be fair, some of those gray hairs were dried egg cream."
"Turns out, when you projectile vomit on skates, you roll right into the spray."
"Wait, how old does she think you are?"
"So, were you in Vietnam?"
Hold that groan.
Charlie was everywhere.
She's hot!
She likes old guys!
Don't judge me!
"Anyway, when we got out on the dance floor, th..."
"I swear, this is what all the 20-year-olds looked like..."
"I want to thank you for your service to this nation, Private."
Colonel.
Aw.
I got to end this.
"Yeah, seriously, Ted."
Pretending to be someone else just to get laid?
That's...
embarrassing.
Your Highness!
Let's go.
Ew.
"Marshall, take that off."
What?
I think it looks kind of cool.
Cool?
Naina and I have seen a flat for ourselves.
We will go there.
"And what about me, sister-in-Iaw?"
I am like a guest in this house.
"If not with you, then III live with brother and sister-in-Iaw."
"But you dont worry, sister-in-Iaw."
"III search for a room for you, brother and Jyoti."
"Yes, III have to pay the rent."
III pay it.
youll pay the rent!
people sacrifice their lives in orderto..
..keep their dignity intact!
Our house is getting auctioned..
..and you have no shame at all!
Even though you all are the brothers of..
"..such a kind man, you have stooped so low."
Sister-in-Iaw!
"Vicky, I beg of you!"
Dont let this house get auctioned!
I beg of you!
Listen to me!
This.. this is our house!
Do something!
Do something!
Dont let this house get auctioned!
Vicky!
Vicky!
Ravi!
"gentlemen, before starting this auction, I would Iike to.."
..tell you that Mr. Chaudhry will bid..
..forthis luxurious mansion first.
50 lakhs.
"- Oh, Mike."
- You'll see my head...
- There we go.
"You can hardly tell, but I thought..."
"When it happened, I was like, ""Great, that'll look like I did that on purpose."""
And then you can't tell.
It looks like I have a spastic neck movement.
- Tom Richmond.
- Tom Richmond.
"It hurt though, really."
I think I was bleeding.
I was actually bleeding from that.
They had to put makeup on it.
- Yeah.
- Mike.
"For the rest of the movie, whenever you see me, I had makeup on."
"No, that's not true."
- It's horrible.
"- Oh, God, that was real vodka."
- It's a controversial shot.
"- Whose voice is that, Pete, yelling?"
"That's Myron Kerstein, our editor's voice heckling Ari."
Those are good names there:
"Adam Brightman, Nathan Kahane, Joe Drake."
- We love Nathan.
- All those names are good too.
- Good names.
"- New York, we love."
- That's a good couple of names.
- Look how cute...
Mike.
I did not really drink alcohol in that previous scene.
Instantly regretted.
- Where did you learn that phrase?
"- It's true, sir."
"Threatening officers is serious, but given your clean sheet I'll be lenient."
Two dozen lashes.
- I said six.
- March him out.
Right turn.
Forward march.
There were many people who heard me say six.
It was not your decision to make.
- Did you take note of that phrase?
"- Phrase, sir?"
"""An impulse, instantly regretted."""
It may mean nothing.
"But in my opinion, he'd been drilled in it."
"- Drilled, sir?"
By whom?
- I wish I knew.
- He remembered his piece.
"- It didn't save him, did it?"
It helped.
Only two dozen.
Scott-Padget must have nigh run mad.
- You know what two dozen means?
- Shut your mouth.
It means a soft captain.
My old captain on the Swift he never gave less than six dozen.
"Yes, that's what he gave me."
Six dozen.
Look here!
All hands on deck to witness punishment!
"- Much better, Donna."
Thanks.
Listen I didn't thank you how I should have yesterday.
Going through all that with me at the hospital.
It's okay.
What'd your wife say when you told her what happened?
"Not too much, you know."
Did you talk with her about taking walks?
"Yeah, we may do that."
You didn't tell her.
I didn't want to worry her.
"Besides, it turned out to be nothing."
What happened yesterday wasn't nothing.
The doctor said I should take the treadmill test but he doesn't think there's a problem.
"What the doctor said was, you're under extreme stress, you need to relax and he suggests taking long walks after work."
"Yeah, yeah."
"Look, I'm okay."
I'm fine.
Thanks.
- Detective.
- Thanks.
My boss is leaving town.
He wants to hear your prep on the Ortiz testimony.
- He'll come here if necessary.
"- Yeah, all right."
Tomorrow at 2:00?
Tomorrow at 2.
Is Stan Heywood there?
"Stan, John Kelly."
I'm Robin's friend.
I got something for you.
Whenever you want me to drop it by.
I've got three kids.
Shut up.
I know he tripped the silent alarm.
I know there's a dozen cops out there just waiting to kill me.
Then how the hell do you think you're gonna get out of here?
Out the front door.
"Dawkins, you're surrounded."
Drop your weapon or we will fire.
Drop your weapon.
Drop your weapon now.
Fire.
What the hell is this?
His mouth is glued shut.
This isn't Dawkins.
"Flight 106, arriving from Los Angeles, please proceed to baggage carousel number two."
Commander McGarrett?
"This is about my sister, isn't it?"
She disabled a smoke detector on board in the bathroom which is a federal offense.
So we arrested her soon as she landed.
Great.
Jail?
Are you serious?
It was just a cigarette.
"Okay, officer."
I think we're good now.
"Steve McGarrett, from the governor's task force."
You can release her into my custody.
- Let me check with my supervisor.
- Thank you.
"I'm sorry, I messed up."
"I missed you at dad's funeral, Mary."
"Yeah, well, something came up."
(chuckles)
"So, what brings you to Los Angeles today, Toast?"
Waffles.
What?
(chuckles)
"Well, not just waffles, fried chicken too."
Have you ever been to Roscoe's in Hollywood?
"Uh, yeah, sure."
It's great.
"I don't know if I'd travel 3,000 miles for it."
"Yeah, well, clearly you're not as dedicated to excellent waffles as I am."
"But if you're free later, I'd love to take you to breakfast."
"You do know we land at 5:00, right?"
I don't do time zones.
"I do, however, very much enjoy a good breakfast, hence the name."
You're funny.
And you're mind-blowingly attractive.
"(coughs, clears throat)"
(clears throat)
You're gonna just pretend like you didn't see us or what?
Hey.
Jersey.
McGruff.
What a coincidence.
You guys going to LA?
No.
"No, and neither are you."
"Impeccable timing as always, fellas."
"Thanks to you, I am not having chicken and waffles with a bona fide ten."
DANNY:
"Hold on, hold on."
Stop.
I was actually afraid that he would kill me.
He finished...
"Got up, and, um..."
Said goodbye.
And i said bye.
That was it.
"Oh, my god."
"But he gave me my ziggy, so..."
Have you talked to anybody about this?
Like a therapist or a counselor or someone?
You're the first person i've ever told.
"Oh, honey."
"There was a point where i thought that i had moved on,"
"That i had worked through it and whatnot,"
"But, no."
I know that i'll never be over it.
"But i know that i have to keep moving forward, you know?"
That kid is--
He's gonna have a good life.
But the name of his father
Is not going on that fucking poster board.
You're never gonna believe this.
Hey.
The theme for the school party
Is elvis presley and audrey hepburn.
"Oh, dear god, no."
Exactly.
Where's amabella?
She's in her room.
I'm admiring how beautiful...
"Remember after the remodel, we just walked around,"
Staring at how perfect everything was?
... you'dforgetwhogot you here?
I don't forget anything.
You're developing a short memory.
Or a selective one.
You want me to refresh it for you?
"I'm sorry, John."
Here it is.
The off-ramp costs me five million.
Another $35 million for the subway stop.
You'll get some from me.
The rest I got to beg Albany.
I got better things to beg for from Albany.
I got a solution.
How about a spur...
-... offtheCanarsieLine?
-Are you crazy?
A spur is $1 20 million a track mile.
BankExchange is good for the poor.
It's good for the jobless.
It's good for the whole city.
"As for subway stops, infrastructure, off-ramps..."
... wecan'taffordit.
Then you'll have to forget the whole thing.
I love the second-act opener.
Then you won't wanna miss it.
"""""This was a real nice clambake. """""
I'm building up my lOUs with Albany.
The governor needs to step up with a new subway stop...
... orI won'tsupporthim  for re-election.
And the off-ramp?
Next year.
-lt's already in my budget.
Immediately?
I hate to trouble you... but there's something I want you to find out.
I heard there's someone who works different kind of jobs.
They say this person even works as a replacement driver at night.
Agent.
"Agent, chief, minister..."
Don't you have internet access?
Just go online and search.
What are you doing?
Why don't you drink more?
I know something more exciting than drinking.
Let's leave.
Do you still have a fever?
Yes.
"If your condition changes, just contact me at anytime."
Good.
Thanks for your hard work.
Get into the car first.
Are you the replacement driver?
Yes.
The call sounded really urgent.
Take us to the Ecstasy Hotel by Doosan intersection.
"Yes, sir."
Wait a second!
Miss Kim Mi Hee.
Let's have a little talk.
Do you know him?
"No, this is the first time I've met him."
How do you know my name?
I'm from the Seoul District...
I didn't bring it!
"Anyway, there's something we need to talk about."
"Okay, I think we got some things out in the open."
"Nathan, do you think that basketball is part of your families problem?"
- Part of.
- But you still like playing?
I don't know anymore.
"Great, nice break through Nate."
"Thanks, Doc."
- Dan.
- Hustle up!
No way this is helping.
"You're right, Dan, we don't need a shrink to identify this families problem, you just made it obvious."
"I'm not his only parent, Deb."
"- Hey why don't you ride with your old man, Nathan."
"- Stop it, Dan."
"Come on Nathan, lets go."
Let the kid make up his own mind.
"What do you say, son?"
Nate?
Nathan!
Here we go.
This is the writer I was talking about.
Somerset Maugham?
"Well its, ""Maugham"""
- Human Bondage.
- Bondage!
"Yeah, its not like that."
"So, you're good."
Are we done here?
"Well, I just thought that this was a better opportunity for us to spend some time, you know, hang out with each other."
"And it is, but can we maybe do it someplace that smells a little less funky?"
"Haha, it's the smell of old books."
Like I said!
You'd oversee security across all of North America.
"More power, more authority."
You'd never have to set foot in the Quiet Room again.
"I have to get back to work, sir."
♪ [device beeps]
[exhales] Jesus.
You got a gut feeling about who did this?
I have someone in mind.
"Hey, didn't hear you come home last night."
I didn't.
I fell asleep in my car.
- You what?
- [chuckles softly]
You're working too hard.
"I know you want that promotion, but don't kill yourself for a swimming pool."
You're right.
"I'm sorry, did Ben Larson just concede that his job isn't the be-all end-all of everything?"
Maybe it's time I put us first instead.
Why don't you come home early tonight?
I'll be here.
Unless you want me to sleep in the car again.
[chuckles softly]
Um...
"Ben, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about."
What?
[chuckles softly] What is it?
Um...
- [high-pitch squeal] - [groans]
Shit.
Migraine?
"Hydrate, aspirin, and caffeine."
- Lots of caffeine.
Come on with me.
"-ls that him there, kid?"
-No.
-How about him?
-Nope.
-That's the guy--
-Get him.
Excuse me.
-Scumbag.
"-Come here, you piece of shit."
-Know this kid?
-Yeah.
-Know where he lives?
-Yeah.
-You deliver mail to his house?
-Yeah.
"From now on, any letter from that school to that kids house comes directly here."
You understand?
"If another letter from that school goes to that kid's house in the fuckin' oven you're gonna go, head first."
That was it.
No more letters from truant officers.
No more letters from school.
"In fact, no more letters from anybody."
"Finally, after a couple of weeks, my mother had to go to the post office and complain."
How could I go back to school after that and pledge allegiance to the flag and sit through good government bullshit?
Paulie hated phones.
He wouldn't have one in his house.
Mickey called.
Want me to call him back?
"All right, make the call."
He used to get all his calls second hand.
Then you'd have to call the people back from an outside phone.
Is that you?
Why'd you leave so early this morning?
We could've shared an Uber.
[chuckles]
"Oh, I didn't want to wake you..."
Or talk more.
I've almost never been up to this floor.
Now I guess I have six-foot-four reasons to come hang out.
Boop!
"See you at lunch, bae!"
ALL:
Ooh!
I can't believe Amy works here.
And why is she acting like we're dating after one casual night of the best sex of her life?
Because you straight-up agreed to date her?
"Uh, don't you remember?"
"Uh, no."
"Oh, no, Jack, did you do that thing where you only act like you're listening and instead just say ""uh-huh"" and ""great"" to everything?"
So nice to put a face to the paycheck.
Uh-huh.
This has been fun.
You're a good listener.
Great.
"Look, I'm done sleeping around, but if you think we have something real here..."
Uh-huh.
...then let's go back to your place.
"Wait, what?"
"Oh, great!"
EMMA:
Wait.
So you only heard the part when she brought up sex?
"Isn't that gross, Clark?"
"Good afternoon, ma'am."
Will you be voting?
-You're running in the 6th District?
-l am.
"Well, 6th District is my district."
I'm very interested in who'll represent me.
I'm interested that you're interested.
"As Huey Long once said, and I quote:"
"""""lf you got a friend, you got a vote. """""
-Did he say that?
-He sure did.
He told me to move to the 6th District.
He said the people are special.
-So do I have your vote?
-You can count on it.
That's one.
No.
"More than one, actually."
I hear Elaine Santos is ready to stand up for you.
Sounds like a groundswell.
I wish I could tell you I won but I got thrashed by a Dominican from 104th Street.
"I got branded an outsider, and I was never in it."
"But I'll be back in 2 years, and I'll win."
You know why?
I'm willing to be lucky.
And if you're willing to be lucky New York will give you a chance.
English Subtitles by Gelula/sdl
New York City.
So many things have been said about it  but there's only one I really like.
"""New York  it can destroy you or fulfill you, depending a good deal on luck. """
No one should come here unless he's willing to be lucky.
- Mikhail's back.
- Bring him to me.
How can I bring him in when I've got my hands tied behind my back?
Let me deal with him my own way.
This is not a democracy.
You do what I say.
You understand?
Mikhail has caused no trouble.
"If FBI had the list, believe me... we'd have major war with Italians, with everyone."
"If he is here, then list is still in France."
I will convince Mikhail to take proper course of action.
"So, bring him to me."
I meant no disrespect.
I'm just worried.
Remember when you told me about Goradini talking to the FBI?
And Pietro?
And Andrea?
"I took care of them for you, Dimitri."
But Mikhail is different.
I know you feel like he's your son.
"Yes, Dimitri."
- is this also Mikhail's place?
"- No, my friend's."
Mikhail and I used for come here to escape.
You looked comfortable with that gun stuck in that guy's neck today.
That didn't scare me as much as when you tried to drown him in the Jacuzzi.
I lost it.
Sorry.
How long you been working at the Bohemia?
About a year.
I used to dance.
Nightclubs.
You nearly did.
- Shut up.
What was that?
"Nothing, I'm sorry."
"- We should begin, Dad."
"Okay, let's begin."
Sorry I can't stay.
You're all invited to the reception.
"Yitzhak, please come."
"I think the reading should be done ""mis en scene""."
Which means?
"Which means,"
"Monsieur Laroire, please come over here."
This is your clinic.
You're straightening the diplomas on the wall.
The wall is here.
"You're a plastic surgeon, you have diplomas, you took a lot of courses, straighten the courses."
"Mademoiselle Principale, please come over here."
Over here.
"Open the door, come in, and close the door behind you."
"Read, please."
"I don't have the text, I..."
"Not only did you not read the text at home, you think you know it by heart."
"Are you going to keep pestering me, Mademoiselle Principale?"
Yes.
"Well, what is it?"
"Well, I'm not going to give in, doctor, until you..."
"Until I what, miss?"
"Until you, doctor..."
Wait.
There's no point in just yelling at her.
You're in love with her.
"I will just have to take my frustration out... on your good friend, Sam, who is working here."
"Okay, I'll do it."
What do you think of our new owner?
Pretty tough broad.
"But, uh, I guess she has to be."
She's a cooler.
Serious?
Told ya.
Maybe I'm not a cooler.
Well played.
Only one guy's left Acme recently- a Richie Tomczak.
"Uh, but it was for medical reasons."
"His doctor said that he had some bad disease, only had a couple months to live."
"What did I ask you for, a medical report or address?"
"Uh, yes, sir."
An address.
Mr. Tomczak?
Richie?
Hey.
Holy-
I guess your doctor was right.
What did you tell the cops?
What do you think I told them?
I told them the truth.
"I mean, pretty close."
"Actually, I told them, uh, I went there to talk to Richie... about some possible counterfeiting problem we had."
"Anyway, I told them the door was unlocked."
Sit down.
So they'll focus on the murder.
Right.
You think Tomczak was involved with the chip counterfeiting?
There's a pretty good chance.
"Big, big jackpot on Monday."
Garfunkel?
"Yeah, I'm probably the biggest Garfunkel who ever lived."
"I mean, after all I've done for her."
"You know, I give her money almost every week."
But doesn't she work for you?
"That's not the point, exactly."
"Adrian, Natalie is a human being."
"Now, all this attention can throw a person off balance."
Especially if it comes suddenly and unexpectedly.
"You know, I once wrote a book on body language and it spent all of three minutes on the best-seller list."
"Now, I was very young and I'm sorry to say I became a bit of a diva."
I didn't like myself very much.
"So, now, you're on her side."
"The question is, why aren't you on her side?"
Why aren't you happy for her?
Natalie is your friend.
Maybe you're afraid she doesn't need you anymore.
Maybe you're afraid of losing her.
Or maybe I just feel insulted.
Insulted?
What I do is hard.
I am out there.
I am sweating out every clue.
I am putting killers behind bars.
What does she do?
What does she do?
91.
Number 91.
91.
Number 91.
91.
"and it said,"
"""Nuts."""
"Why did he say, ""Nuts""?"
"It means, ""Go to hell!"""
"Why didn't he just say, ""Go to hell""?"
"Because he said, ""Nuts."""
Nuts.
Peanuts.
Gail!
"Gail, my sweetheart, you look beautiful."
"Save it, Dad."
Was it your idea to get my son drunk tonight?
No.
No.
Right.
Okay.
Everybody back to the reception.
Come on.
But I'm hammered.
And I want to talk to you.
"Have a cup of coffee, Stanley."
Here.
"Well, what's this?"
"Well, as your brother's best man, you are required to give a toast, so I wrote down a few thoughts, some things that you might want to say."
You think I was going to wing it?
"Let's go take some pictures, okay?"
What's going on?
"Mr. Green, I have access to a keyhole military satellite that I can use to track New Bern's movements in the field today."
Beg pardon?
It's real.
The one restriction is that no one can know where you're getting this information.
Tell them I'm... scouting in the field-- tell them what you want-- but the satellite must remain a secret.
"- I was just making the point, sir, that you've been screwing every girl in here with your eyes since we arrived, which suggests that sex ranks higher than substance."
"And I'll pass, thanks."
"You see, I don't really find intellectual thrust that sexy..."
"Or fake tan, for that matter."
"Oh, you think that's funny, do you?"
- It's possibly funny...
- Possibly funny.
"The thing is, I don't actually have to put up..."
OK.
Cool.
See you!
I think you should join her.
"Don't you, Tony?"
Toodle-oo.
You.
You really fucked up in there.
I really fucked up?
"Wait, what are you even doing here, anyway?"
Same thing you are.
Wow!
Check it out.
Ah...
Shall we?
No.
No way.
"First of all,"
I can't really swim very well any more and secondly...
"Ahh, boo-hoo."
What the fuck?
!
"I told you, I can't..."
I can't...
I will reassess.
- I will signal in the usual way.
- No.
Absolutely no further radio contact.
You have to take photographs.
Deliver them personally to the Führer.
- Personally?
Why?
- He says he trusts you.
- He wants to hear from your own mouth.
"- Well, I'm flattered."
Admiral Canaris is sending a U-boat to pick you up off the coast of Scotland.
That's nice.
Have you been carrying this around?
Yes.
Why?
- Let's go.
- We'll get them both.
What's this?
Storm Island.
Two miles from the rendezvous.
- The U-boat will pick me up when?
- When you signal it.
From six in the evening until six in the morning.
Six in the evening till six in the morning.
Beginning when?
"A week from today, and for a week after that."
And you.
How will you get out of England?
I'm supposed to get to Liverpool somehow.
If they capture you and torture you?
- I have a suicide pill.
Mistress.
My Juliet?
"Oh, still fast asleep?"
"Come, lady."
"Come, lamb."
It's time to wake.
"Well, you'll profit from a few hours dreams."
"Tonight, Count Paris will have other plans."
"But if your marriage will not let you rest, just wait ten years."
You'll sleep all you want.
"Heavens, how sound you slumber."
I must needs wake you.
Lady.
Lady!
"Oh, no!"
"Come, is my bride ready to go to church?"
"Ready to go, but never to return."
"My son... the night before your wedding day, your wife was stolen from you."
What?
Are you saying she is dead?
Flower as she was...
Death is now my heir.
My daughter he has married.
I will die and leave him all.
"Life, living, all is Death's."
This day had promised all my happiness... and now it shows me such a sight as this?
"Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!"
The worst that ever dawned.
Most woeful day.
Never was so black a day as this.
"I am divorced... wronged... hated... killed by Death, but Death is my future."
He holds all I love.
"If I trust my employees, it's their duty to uphold my trust."
And not break it.
It's your duty to live up to my trust.
I understand.
It's simple.
"If I take care of people, they should also take care of me."
Of course.
So I guess.
A hand searches for another hand.
I hope you understand what I am saying.
I will see you in the office.
- Yeah.
Sure.
Bye.
"Sir, newspaper is here."
Keep it in the car.
You are the only one that can handle this.
Okay.
The officer was shot several times.
The wounded officer's condition would be serious.
Hello?
We have no money for the restaurant.
We can not meet you.
I'm sorry.
I'll call you back.
Despite the heavy night and morning in Gothenburg -
- The police management There are no comments.
But Police Chief Lena Tornell -
- Holds a press conference about the events.
"Vijay approves 200,000."
- Have you heard anything?
"- No, but anyone knows where he is."
How do you feel?
"Still dopey, otherwise I'm in the pink."
What I came to say is...
"Leave off, will you?"
It could have happened to anybody.
How are the boys?
"Well, they're fine."
Can I get you something?
Not a thing.
Sure now?
"Sure, I'm fine."
"Except, my feet they're very cold."
Do you think you could tuck that blanket in for me?
I can't reach it from here.
Sure.
"Ooh, that's much better."
- Madame Sand!
I'm melting with delight!
"Oh, and you've brought your two boys!"
- I'm a girl.
- Ah.
"Here, Master Delacroix."
I have given you my own studio.
"The light, you can see, is perfection."
When is Monsieur Chopin arriving?
Tomorrow.
Or so he wrote to me in his letter.
Here is the theatre!
Sometimes we indulge ourselves in little amateur productions.
"And here, Madame Sand, is your workroom."
"If you open the doors, perhaps our southern moonlight will inspire you to write those sublime novels which I so admire."
George!
"So, Aaron, what kind of career do you think I should go into?"
"I got into math and computers because there was this deep, dark..."
I don't know...
hole inside me and math filled it.
"You need to figure out where your hole is, and try different things until you discover what fills it."
"Wow, I was not expecting to say this, but this really might be your fault."
I got to find her.
I got to find Mary Webber.
I got to talk some sense into her.
- I started this.
I got to end this.
- Whoa.
Wait.
No.
"What about my ""pornado""?"
Yeah.
"Whatever, Neil."
"Yeah, everyone knows you're eating Marci's pudding snacks."
"Yeah, that's right."
"Yeah, I've seen you."
Son.
"Friends with Benefits The Benefit of Mentors August 26, 2011"
Where should we go for lunch?
Let's do vegan.
"I just bought a leather jacket, and I wanna balance it out."
Who are you talking to?
Some loser I can't get rid of.
He won't stop texting me.
So you're texting him back?
"Well, I can't just ignore him."
That would be totally rude.
"Plus, you never know."
Everything's cold cold cold.
"...can only destroy itself, with bourgeoise means, bourgeoise sets, bourgeoise costumes, bourgeoise acting, the bourgeoise at the bidding of the Revolution, in the name of wrecked humanity."
Their souls melted into one...
"the universal soul, it's me."
In me human consciousness blends into the animal instinct.
And I can live each and every existence through me.
This stuff sounds decadent.
"Alone in the universe, my spirit remains..."
She's fresh.
Simon's ham... she'll get you.
"It's beautiful, what she says."
I want the book.
Let go!
Did she get you?
Who got me?
Who got you?
You did.
I love you.
You.
I love you.
You.
I love you.
"You, I love you."
Maybe it would be useful to remove your pantaloons if you want to see the light.
Do you want me to?
Why?
Because people normally do it for me.
I can also tie up your feet.
Why?
"Because, usually I'm the one they tie up."
And why that?
Because usually I'm the ridiculous one.
You like it?
Mm-hmm.
"You know, it's funny--"
Yo.
Yo.
"I thought you were out with Sandra, the waitress."
"Sondra, the coffee server."
"Oh, well, maybe I'd know how to pronounce her name if you'd introduce me to her."
Stop it.
"Well, that's funny that you mention that."
What are you doing tomorrow?
Uh...
"Meeting Sondra, the coffee server."
"in what, uh, two years?"
Three.
"But, um..."
"She might be someone special, so it's important for me that she meets you."
"All right, bring her by."
"Oh, by the way, Grandfather called."
Lunch is at 12:30.
Day after tomorrow.
Does the guy have to have a birthday every single year?
"Come on, Jerry, you're the one that's always talking about letting go of the past."
He did the best that he could when we were kids.
That's easy for you to say.
"You only defend him because he likes you, and he loves hearing about your work."
Grandpa likes you.
[laugh] Wow.
It's amazing.
"And ironic,if I may say, what a bad liar you are"
"Okay, so maybe he likes me a tad more."
But that's only because you remind him so much of Dad.
What loud?
Obnoxious?
Forceful. I'm Patty Chase.
- H i.
- Angela's mom?
Angela.
Rayanne talks about her all the time.
She's in love with her.
She wants to be Angela.
Really?
Gosh they seem so different.
You know kids.
They find one person and they just can't get enough of them.
Like being in love only they are not allowed to have sex.
Right.
"No, don't you remember there would be like this one person..."
"who had like perfect hair, or perfect breasts, or they were just so funny..."
and you just wanted to eat them up.
J ust live in their bed and just be them.
Like everybody else was in black and white and that person was in color.
Rayanne thinks Angela is in color.
Major color.
Thanks.
"So, how is Rayanne handling this whole incident?"
- She's great. I'm the basket case.
- Angela's just the same.
"'Who's going to shoot me with this body, Mom?"
' She says.
They think they're immortal.
And they have other things in mind.
Speaking of which Jordan is unbelievable.
Your daughter has complete taste.
"Hey, where is he?"
He took my car.
- Kono.
- I'm on it.
"Shoulder wound, through and through."
- Dana?
- The surgeons are working on her.
"Listen to me, did Dawkins say where he was going after the bank?"
"I saw a passport and now that he has his money, he's gonna disappear."
Ha-ha-ha.
Whoo!
Damn it.
"Dawkins was on his way to the airport, saw our check point and made a U-turn."
"He's in the H-3 tunnel, headed into Halawa Valley."
Uh-oh.
"Uh-oh, what?"
We're about to lose traffic cam coverage in about two seconds.
He's gone.
"I'm sorry, there's no other cameras on that road."
All right.
Wait a second.
"Why, hello there, sailor."
"Cath, I need your help."
"I'm pursuing a suspect in a black Mercedes, he's headed west to the Halawa Valley."
- Can you give me a visual?
- You want me to access an IKON reconnaissance satellite for your car chase?
This guy has killed three people already today.
"Yeah, look."
This could raise some flags.
"Classify it as an NSA request from a black ops drop box, okay?"
"Come on, Cath."
I need this.
Come look at this.
You ready?
Look.
You see?
"Empty, right?"
I stayed the hell away from the mountains since that day.
Even put the store up for sale.
How is that proof?
What?
Damn you...
That's not the point.
"The point is, when I opened my eyes, there he was-stark naked except for a diaper."
A diaper?
That's right.
A grown man?
I'm telling you.
- Grown men can wear diapers.
- Get outta here.
Bladder control problems are surprisingly common in adults.
But why go into the woods to treat incontinence?
- Incontinence...
- Am I talking to myself here?
"Anyway, he had his face buried in the carcass, his body covered in blood... his eyes all bloodshot."
"Then he looked up, and all of a sudden..."
I haven't slept since that day.
- He was chewing on the guts?
- That's right.
- You saw him eating raw flesh?
- Yeah...
"Wait, look here."
See where the skin's broken?
Bastard even bit me.

"Okay class, we're done for today."
What do you think you're doing?
I...
I just want to take my notes back.
"Eonni, what are you doing?"
(Eonni - older sister)
Sorry.
Are you scared?
"If I only knew, I wouldn't lend it to you!"
Do I have to make it more obvious?
The President is my father!
It's not me!
Da Hye!
"Just now, sorry about it."
This is my first time as a security guard.
"When my father became President,"
I have expected these things to happen.
So I've never had any friends.
Take these.
They should be suitable for you.
"Now, I'm going to the nightclubs."
"You can't wear guard clothes when you go inside, right?"
I certainly don't want to show any surprising flaws.
We will be going to Jiaye Ban.
Ah.. noisy!
I'll fix that guy's wagon.
"I gotta go to town, but I'll be back tomorrow."
"- But, Patsy--"
- I gotta go change my clothes.
I'll see you in a few minutes.
"- Funny, right over--"
- It would've been nice--
- It's just a hair--
- See a beautiful life in this--
"- Hey, boss."
- What is it?
"Been doing all right for yourselves, haven't you?"
And Joe's been doing himself plenty of good.
"- Well, what do you say?"
- We thought you was through.
What gave you that idea?
"- You're a reformer now, ain't you?"
- Who's running this racket?
You was.
Who is now?
- Me.
"- Oh, yeah?"
You think I built this racket up for seven years to let you guys walk away with it?
I'm telling you all something.
You're through.
And as for you....
- Wait a minute.
- Dirty son of a--
Keep those gats in your pockets.
"- Come on, let's get out of here."
"- Yeah, go ahead."
Take care of that rat.
She took what she needed from me to survive... until I perfected the serum.
Father?
Father?
I'm so sorry.
She never fed on anyone after that?
No.
All right.
"Teyla, ronon, you're with me."
"The rest of you, stay here."
"Colonel, the retrovirus is acting quickly."
The human part of her is almost gone.
You said she killed the other wraith and saved McKay's life.
"Yes, but I'm not sure she knew what she was doing."
She's operating on a purely animal level right now.
Is there nothing you can do for her?
"I might be able to reverse the effects,"
"If you bring her back alive, but I doubt she'll cooperate."
She's also stronger and faster than any wraith I've ever seen.
Great.
All this time... we thought you were dead.
There was no other way.
They never would have accepted us... and I couldn't abandon her.
Why?
She... needed me.
"Colonel, this is Beckett."
Go ahead.
Addict's dead.
Understood.
She knows we're here.
She's watching us.
Ellia?
We want to help you.

Thank you very much.
Raise the lamp so I can see your face.
"I haven't seen Yossef, so at least let me know his taste."
You won't tell me your name and you won't let me see your face.
At least light the ground so I don't trip up.
How long did she study?
Who?
That woman whose poem you recited.
Forough?
I think she was in school until the fourth or fifth year.
"You know, writing poetry has nothing to do with diplomas."
"If you have talent, you can do it too."
How much do I owe you?
"- of course you can, baby."
"harley, make sure you get all the right ones, okay?"
- we get our own presents this year?
- yep.
and i didn't even use the claw machine. [chuckles]
- what about me?
- of course you.
"honey, come here."
come here.
but you know your daddy is away in yuma.
he had a match.
but i told him i'd take [singsong voice] real good care of you.
"- here, brandie."
- [chuckles]
"- so, you need to start dressing a little more respectable."
- this is really great what you did.
we are gonna be so happy together!
"- um, can i give this to you outside?"
"awesome. bye, baby."
come on.
"- come here, champ."
let me look at you.
"- look at me, dad."
- look at that!
"she made you stronger, too, huh?"
- [sighs] here. open it.

"What happened last night... you didn't have a choice, Phillip."
This is war.
You think they would've done anything less to us?
Reagan --
I don't need the speech.
I know it's war.
This is easier for you.
"You think it's easy for me, what I do?"
The FBI called me this morning.
They want to meet with me tomorrow afternoon.
"Well, could this be a routine security check?"
No one goes to DC for a routine security check.
Do you know if anyone else was called?
Everyone who was at the meeting in Alexandria.
"I could postpone the meeting, find out what they asked the other folks before going in there."
No.
No.
That would be suspicious.
All right.
"I'll just go in, then."
"Look, you don't have to worry about me."
I'll be fine.
Paul...
Emmett -
- Emmett taught me how to handle this situation.
"- Yeah, he was one of the best."
"- Yes, he was --"
"I miss him, too."
But we're working together now.
He said there was one person who ordered the hits on the five spies.
One person behind Mom and Dad's cover-up.
But Henry says he doesn't know who it is.
"Well, we have to find out."
But how are we gonna-- [phone rings]
Damn it.
Let the machine get it.
Hello?
Any closer to finding Gus Walker's killer?
How did you get this number?
"Come on, Special Agent Henson."
Why do I even ask?
You really should consider using me as a resource on Walker.
I don't need you as a resource.
"Well, for, uh, someone with no leads, you're quick to throw away free information."
What could you possibly know that I don't already have?
Something I'm unwilling to share on the phone.
Meet me at King Street Lounge in ten minutes.
"I'll be gone in 15, along with the info."
[hangs up phone]
I have to go.
But what about-- And don't go anywhere.
"We're gonna work on this as soon as I get back, okay?"
Okay.
Okay?
Would I lie to you?
"Um, Sondra..."
"I'm sorry, I gotta go."
But thanks for the cookies.
Bye.
Nice to meet you.
"(Angela) Nice to meet you, too."
"You being my new boss, I'm hesitant to point out that it... it might not be that easy."
Heartbeat looks normal for 10 weeks.
No evidence of bleeding from the trauma.
So the baby's okay?
Looks fine.
"Michelle, does this kind of thing happen often,"
"Darren hitting Tammy, hitting you?"
It was an accident.
I want to see my daughter.
"Michelle, look, I know this is hard to talk about, but you stabbed your husband."
"Now if you were protecting Tammy, if this was self-defen..."
"God, you're making us sound like..."
It was not like that.
Darren didn't do anything.
You don't have to make excuses.
I was cooking... and Darren and I started arguing.
"Tammy tried to stop us, and she got in the way, and Darren pushed her."
"It was an accident, but I got mad and I overreacted and I had a knife in my hand."
Please.
I need to be with Tammy.
I need to make sure she's okay.
"Okay, okay."
Michelle Larsen.
We have a warrant for your arrest.
What?
"No, no."
"No, officer."
Her husband hit her.
It was an accident.
"Okay, Michelle."
"No, look, she has a daughter who needs her."
She's pregnant.
"Have anything to do with the ""Gossip Girl"" blast?"
¶ science will just have to... ¶
Is it true?
Are you dealing?
¶ all right ¶
"I was,"
"When I was dating Damien, yeah."
"But, no, not anymore."
This could so easily get back to dad.
I I think it'd be better if he heard it from you.
Are you insane?
I
"- I mean, you and I both know that's a suicide mission."
Look...
"If you want him to have faith in you, Jenny,"
Maybe you need to have a little faith in him.
¶ how many times can this be repeated?
¶
"Yeah, all right."
I'll go see if I can dig out a dress from my old closet.
"Maybe I can catch him at the gala-you know,"
"Big crowd, lots of witnesses."
Oh.
"Uh, is everything okay with you and Vanessa?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, well, at least I think it is."
It's been hard to say lately.
"Maybe you need to have a little faith, too."
"¶ all right, given our history, what can you expect?"
¶
It's great to see you again.
"You, too."
Bye-bye.
"Hey, Danny."
"Listen, I'm telling you there's something not right about those two."
You mean something besides the fact that they believe in ghosts?
I don't know.
"Just check 'em out, all right?"
I already did.
"Neither one of them has so much as a speeding ticket, much less a criminal record."
You don't think the guy that lost the money clip was in with them or something?
Could be.
I'll look into it.
"Yeah, because there's something strange."
"I just got this... this feeling, you know, that something's not right."
"Maybe it's like a sixth sense, I think."
Mr. Harpel.
Hi.
I'm so sorry.
I thought we were supposed to meet at Opus.
My mistake.
Nice dress.
"Oh, thank you."
"Samantha Marquez, I presume."
Logan.
Paul Logan.
At last we meet.
Excuse us for a moment.
[Clears Throat]
"[Sam] I'm not sure how they do things where you're from, but here, stealing people's clients is considered bad form."
Stealing?
"Far as I know, Harpel was never your client."
Mmm.
Right.
Appreciate it.
Hi.
David Aceveda.
Vote for me.
That's an arm.
Went to Armadillo's place to talk to him about Tio's murder.
–What'd he say?
–He wasn't there.
Signs of a struggle though.
"Bloodstains, seared flesh on the stove."
–Pretty ugly stuff.
–That sounds like Armadillo's MO.
Checked Tio's phone records.
You were the last call he made last night on his cell before he died.
Yeah.
He sounded kind of agitated.
–We got cut off.
–Too bad.
What are you asking me?
"Look, I don't like these questions any more than you do."
I was with my guys all last night while Tio was being killed.
Feel free to ask 'em.
"Okay, then."
"Single blow, a heavy blade."
"–An ax, maybe a machete."
–How long ago?
"Based on core temp, I'd say recently."
–Three to four hours.
–So she's been dead since around 6:00.
Didn't say she was dead.
Skin lividity and clotting... indicate she was alive when this happened.
–Sadomasochistic torture ritual.
Really?
- Haven't you exhausted the subject?
- No.
"No, I wanna go deeper, you know?"
I want to understand why people were labeled as vampires.
"I mean, maybe there is such a thing as vampires."
Just different from the way we always thought they were.
What do you mean?
"Well, maybe they're normal and good, just outsiders, you know."
Um...
Misunderstood.
"You're kidding, right?"
Don't you think it could be possible?
You did give me all that info.
"Jeremy, I made it up, okay?"
"I mean, you were all cute and floppy and I wanted to make a good impression."
- Is there anything you're not good at?
- Double dating.
This is all kind of new to me.
I usually keep to myself.
I don't always fit in.
- That's because you're that guy.
- What guy?
The guy who seems like he has everything.
So the people that don't kind of run the other way.
- Is that what I seem like?
- Pretty much.
Hm.
- What a dick.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
"So, um..."
Yuuki-kun?
!
I thought the Supporter eliminated you!
I destroyed my Noblesse phone and disappeared on purpose so I could get revenge on him.
I have an urgent request.
Yes?
Move the third trailer to the front.
Of course.
Thank you.
Request accepted.
Noblesse oblige.
I pray that tomorrow you continue to be a worthy savior.
Juiz.
Juiz...
You were the best employee I ever worked with.
No. 09.
I can no longer be your guardian angel.
No. 01 is making a bid to win the game.
But I'm betting on you.
Don't forget your promise.
Promise?
I pray that you'll be a compassionate king.
Go.
Help him in any way you can.
Kuroha-san...
I'm going back to Japan.
Ato-san's not happy about it either.
the political fallout will be huge.
That's exactly why we need Iinuma-sensei's son as our scapegoat.
I have faith that in the end you'll prevail.
you're the man who launched 60 missiles at his own country.
You have my word.
"Thanks, Mike."
"Well, plus some of your other outstanding attributes."
Please.
Please!
Tell Miss Mancuso to talk to me.
This is Mike.
I'll be right down.
Two guys throwing' at Bella Petto.
"Look, man, read the sign."
"Read the freakin' sign, all right."
"Look, I am here."
"Get up, read the sign because-"
What is the problem?
That douche bag took a chair I reserved.
I left my magazine and sunblock on the table.
Only thing that reserves a chair is a towel.
"You don't know jack, pal."
"Sir, there are plenty of other lounges available."
"Okay, I get it."
"Uh, first of all, give it another 30 minutes."
There'll be 10 more just like her out here.
Trust me on this.
Looks like your brother from another mother beat you to it.
"So what you gonna do, hmm?"
"Relax, sit back and enjoy the Bella Petto experience."
"Believe me, there is nothing more important than asset management."
"And I mean that, really."
"Listen, why don't you- Why don't you call me?"
Okay?
Thanks.
All right.
You setting up shop here?
I still do.
Huge.
"So, are you gonna have sex with her?"
I was her mentor.
She was my mentee.
I am not going to take advantage of a girl that looks up to me.
"Dude, God has dropped a porn star into your lap, okay?"
Don't disappoint Him.
He can be a jealous and a vengeful God.
Mmm.
Amen.
I am officially done with this conversation.
"Aaron, I am with you."
"And right now, you can still influence her life in a totally positive way."
And it would be creepy and weird if you slept with her.
"Hey, hey, hey."
We all agree that it would be creepy and weird.
That's why we want him to do it.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Come on.
It happened on a doctors without borders trip in Indonesia.
A lovely woman was a few weeks from giving birth to a child with a heart defect.
I operated on the baby in utero.
"Fortunately, both the mother and child survived and are now thriving."
I found out later she named the baby after me.
Very flattering.
"Aw, little Dr. Lonsdale."
"Um, Everett, actually."
I know.
That was a joke.
Oh.
- Shut up.
How do you like the new you?
Did I interrupt the procedure?
Can Henry not talk yet?
"- No, he can't."
No.
"- Don't look at me like that, Henry."
"Your girlfriend here... might have rebuilt you, but I gave her the raw materials to work with."
"And I mean really, really raw materials."
- What's your name?
- Timothy.
"Nice to meet you, Timothy."
Did you see Henry when Estelle brought his remains here?
Yeah.
Would you please be so kind to describe them to better Henry's understanding of how good he looks now?
Sure.
His arm was shot off below the... below the elbow and the...
the leg shot off below the knee.
- And there was a football-sized dent...
- Did you happen to see his head?
- Yes.
- Do tell.
"Um, the skull was dented in and there was this, um... his eyes were missing and, um... the bottom half of his jaw was shred to pieces."
Just about right.
"I'm bleeding, too."
That was a little strenuous.
Stay close.
Henry!
Hurry up!
Close it.
"Henry, come on!"
"Henry, try to keep up!"
Enjoy the rest of your evening.
(pencil SHARPENER WHlRRlNG)
The principal wanted to see me?
No.
I did.
I'm concerned about the detention today.
How Allison ended up in there with you and Mr. Stilinski.
A sink was ripped off the wall.
You're lucky I'm here to explain that to people somehow.
You realize that?
Yeah.
I do now.
Good.
Are you having sex with my daughter?
(WHlRRlNG)
No.
I'm not having sex with your daughter.
I certainly hope not.
Hello?
It means he was born after his mom died by c-section.
They had to pull him out of her dead body.
"You okay, dude?"
So was it an accident or not?
"The word all over the report is ""inconclusive."""
Then his parents could have been murdered?
"If they were, then it falls in line with the Kanima myth."
You know?
It seeks out and kills murderers.
But for Jackson?
Or for the person controlling him?
We have to talk to him.
We have to tell him.
Send him in.
"- Would you come in, Mr. Rossi?"
- Yes.
Thank you.
- Good morning.
- I'm Leslie Harrington.
This is the school board.
Mr. And Mrs. Partridge.
He's a lawyer.
Dr. Swain.
Seth Bushwell.
He's editor of the Peyton Place Times.
"Mr. Rossi, here's our situation."
We're prepared to offer the job as principal to a qualified man with a minimum guaranteed five-year contract.
"Mr. Rossi is a graduate of Penn State, summa cum laude."
He holds a master's degree in English and literature.
He was an outstanding athlete.
He's single.
"Personally, now that I've seen him, I like what I see."
- Did I miss anything?
- I've been working in construction.
"If you're a teacher, why were you working there?"
I couldn't live on the salary of a teacher.
This job starts at 3000 a year.
Then we're all wasting our time.
That's only $5 a week more than I was making as a teacher.
But this offers you security.
A long-term contract.
Guaranteed poverty is not security.
I want 5000 a year and a raise of 500 in the second year.
- We can't do it.
- You own this mill.
Everybody knows everybody.
"Do you grow pot, Mr Trimbole?"
"Do you grow pot, Mr Trimbole?"
"Now, you wouldn't be asking me that if I was Mr Jones, would you?"
"Now, you wouldn't be asking me that if I was Mr Jones, would you?"
You're welcome to search my place.
You're welcome to search my place.

"The planet is actually controlled by a creature, which moves on four legs."

A car is used for moving from place to place.
The meaning of this moving is unknown.
"A car is noisy, comfortable... and gives off an intensive stench."
"Despite this, people live in perfect harmony with this creature."
They remove various obstacles from it's path... and build for it huge structures which are called highways.

People and their strange habits.
For instance... when people are having a drink and smoking at the same time... they always hold the glass in the non-dominant hand.
"Like Kabir Malhotra, I too am left-handed."
Oh my God!
You're right.
And if he was left-handed... why would he pull the trigger with his right hand?
He was murdered.
"But, who did it?"
There's a well known Latin phrase.
'Cui bono?
'
Who benefits?
'
Exactly.
We need to re-examine the evidence.
I'll see you at the airport in an hour.
Why are you doing this for Kabir Malhotra?
I'm not doing it for him.
"Neil, this is Mark and Aiden."
They're on the Malhotra case too.
Here are the details on the will you asked for.

Not yet.

"Can we know his range, Captain?"
We can take an educated guess-- at the point we entered their solar system.
Still no sign of pursuit.
"Instruments clear, sir."
Good.

"Yes, I think you might."

"Oh, the doc does not mess around when it comes to peoples' personality traits."
Gibbs smiled at her.
I saw it.
And the way he walked to the elevator-- it was...
It was what?
Bouncy.
Gibbs' walk definitely had a bounce to it.
"Yeah, happy feet."
I saw it.
Feet are the most honest part of a human's body.
"Eyes are not bad indicators, as well."
I saw Ryan's dilate when Gibbs walked into her office the other day.
"So, what do you think this means?"
"Oh, interest, excitement, you know."
It's a neurovascular response.
"The fact is, the only one who knows what a person is thinking is the person who's thinking it."
I thought you PsyOps agents could interpret everything.
No.
"And even if we could, we wouldn't tell you."
Mm.
"So, Dr. Ryan-- is she...?"
The best.
The annoying big sister I never had.
"I'd do anything for her, and if Gibbs hurts her, I'll kill him."

So we should have a friendly chat with the president and ask him to step down?

"- Good night, Padre."
"Hey, you've become friends."
But who's won over whom?
- We've both learned from each other.
- All right.
You could be dressed as a poor peasant and people would still respect you.
That must be to do with your charisma.
People believe what you say.
That's because I'm convinced of what I say.
"Sure, but that's not all, you know."
It also takes a lot of courage.
I'm not sure whether you're overestimating me.
"I'm scared like everyone else, but I fight it."
"If we know what we believe in and love our fellow men, we will find the strength to fight our fears."
Stop!
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
My name's Rafael.

"Mr. Khanna, it's critical that you do exactly as I say."
You'll never guess.
Tisha was attacked.
But she's alright now.
"Even so, you instructed Mr. Khanna that he should say that his daughter is dead."
How did you know that?
Because it's what I would've done.
"So, it's obvious that there is a killer hiding somewhere."
"Or, perhaps Tisha is lying so that we don't suspect her."
Perhaps.
It's possible.
What does anyone get by killing Tisha?
10 billion Euro.
Sunil... ask Mr. Malhotra's lawyer who inherits after Tisha?
Got that.

Mr. Blake had an excellent reason.
Yeah?
Yeah.

"Well, I wouldn't let him go alone."
"Undoubtedly, that will still impress you as being a very stupid reason."

"She, uh..."
"She was attacked by an animal, a bite to the neck."
She started acting crazy.
"You know, weird, and it seemed like drugs but then you showed me those articles."
And then I saw your face and how it changed that night in the cemetery when I kissed you.
Look.
"You know you can't tell anyone, right?"
Who would believe me?
You'd be surprised.
Why didn't you?
Kill me?
I don't know.

Lost.
Why would you confront me about it?

Might even live in the country.
"(chuckles softly) Boy, you got some kisser."
"Honest, you'll see."
This is probably the luckiest break you ever got that I didn't take you with me.
- Honest.
-All right.
Here.
Just sign this and I'll take the dog.
Everything's in order.
There you are.
Thank you.
There we go.
"Up you go, boy."
That's it.
(speaks indistinctly)
"Something I can do for you, mister?"
"No, no."
(clears throat)
"Say, tell me something."
I just brought a dog back here.
Uh... will somebody pick him up and give him a good home?
"Poached it, seasoned it, and covered it in Thorpe-andaise sauce, my friend."
"You should thank me, dumpy."
You're back in second place with your favorite view...
- Ugh.
- ...
My sweet behind.
Why does everything with him have to be so dramatic?
Why are we stopping?
Ohh.
"Oh, my God!"
I thought I lost you.
What's to tell?
"A truck runs a stop sign, I avoid it, everyone walks away..."
"Bing, bang, no boom."
"- Um, there was a truck!"
- That was crazy!
"- Okay, okay."
- Where did it even come from?
- You don't see that truck...
- Everybody calm down.
Calm down.
Let's not overreact.
- What?
!
- Dad!
- We were almost just killed!
- Yes!
Exactly.
"Almost, which means we're all just fine."
You aren't the least bit upset?
It's gonna take more than that to ruin a morning that started with a whipped-cream smile on my waffle.
"Okay, it may have affected me a little, but sometimes it's hard to know what you're feeling."
"Is that why last night, when I asked you to honka-honka me..."
- you only honka'd me?
- I didn't think you noticed.
Snap's been jealous of Crackle all day.
Just take the cuff off.
"No, but, baby, then all the sex will stop."
"Marshall, you don't need a cuff for me to find you sexy."
"All you have to do is smile, and I'm ready for you to hop on Pop."
"- Thanks, baby."
- Mmm.
Are you too woozy to do it one last time before we seek emergency medical attention?
Only one way to find out.
"I'm sorry, bro."
I totally overreacted.
You think?
I can't believe you're allowed to ship a dead possum.
He died?
That possum was supposed to be an olive branch.
Are you sure he's not just playing dead?
He smells like Marshall's hand.
And wait...
You-You forgive me?
Absolutely.
"Hey, I got a couple cee-gars."
Get over here!
"All right, so where are those cee-gars?"
We'll break 'em out in a minute.
"Hey, Barn."
- Ted?
"- Barney, what is your sister doing here?"
"Nothing, bro."
"Or should I say ""bro-in-law""?"
"George, this was found snagged on the shed where you made the tea."
Got any ideas?
Yeah.
That woman that Henry had a spat with at the party last night.
"She was wearing a cardigan, same colour as that."
Iris Lightman?
Is that her name?
"Thank you, George."
I'm sure we'll have you out of here very shortly.
"Of all the secretaries I know,"
Jean is definitely one of the most obliging.
Interesting?
I'm afraid so.
All right.
I did go to that flower garden this morning.
I wanted to punish Henry Lee for not speaking up.
"Punish him how, Iris?"
By hitting him with a spade.
A spade?
Yes!
"But as I stood there in that garden shed,"
"I realised it wasn't going to solve anything, was it?"
So I left.
That's it?
Yes.
OK.
So this is what really happened.
You put hemlock in Henry's teacup and then set up George Hammond for the crime.
I don't know any George Hammond.
"Come on, Iris, make this easier on yourself."
Where would I get hemlock?
How would I know which cup to put it in?
"OK, he admitted it but there was never any evidence."
"Oh, Mark, come on."
He was seen in the area the night Jesse went missing.
- He killed 4 other children.
"- No, no."
His other victims was older.
It's a different MO.
"- He admitted it, Mark."
- Tell me then why does everyone keep on talking like he's suddenly gonna turn up one day
Because of your mother.
Why do you think we don't live together anymore?
Because she can't move on.
"Now look, he is dead, Mark."
Jesse is dead.
And this is... ?
We have to do a 100.
"Every hour, on, the hour."
I need you to double-check these forensic results.
"Why, what's the problem?"
The problem is they don't make any sense.
Can you stop that?
We've had a DNA hit from the Missing person database.
- From a kid that went missing in 1995.
- What?
"Yeah, so how about you you stop pressing with your boyfriend and check it again?"
Thanks.
Is that Pru?
"Yep, under her married name."
Pru Carew.
"Yeah, it's unfortunate."
"Oh, to think she could have been Mrs. Mark Wells married to a hot-shot lawyer."
And we're back in the playground.
I thought you'd learned that lesson when you lost your daughter.
She made it as far as the tunnels before she was shot.
No!
So much tragedy for one man to bear... and now your foolishness has condemned another innocent woman.
Take the others back for questioning.
I'll interrogate this one myself.
No!
I won't let you hurt her!
Caylem!
Ralkana... he said you'd been shot.
"He was lying to you, Father."
I'm all right.
And your mother?
She's fine.
She was so happy to get your letters.
She wanted me to tell you something.
She forgives you.
We both do.
My sweet girl.
Captain.
I'm coming.
No one will forget what he did here today.
I'll make sure of that.
Chakotay to Transporter Room 2.
Do we have them?
"We're all back, Commander."
Take us out of here.
Gladly.
"Lieutenant, you heard her."
"The warp drive is functioning normally, and we'll have the main deflector back on line tomorrow."
"Yes, thank you, Mr. Kim."
"Captain, are you all right?"
"- It's an honor, sir."
- I've been meaning to have you up here for some time.
- Really?
Excuse me.
Willie?
"Thank you, Willie."
"Yeah, you betcha."
You unseated that old bastard Bettis.
He must've voted against me 70 percent of the time.
You know what this is?
That's a shark steak sandwich.
Fucking shark steak.
- You want half?
"- Uh, no, thank you."
- Are you a vegan?
Had lunch?
- No.
Uh...
So you choose not to break bread with the president of the United States?
Thank you.
"When I was in the Senate, Bettis could always be counted to leave half a grand at the poker table."
"Always stayed in, never folded."
Always wanted that miracle card.
"- That's good, isn't it?"
- Mm-hmm.
"Now, Truman, he was a poker player."
"Damn fine one, as I understand it."
"Son, I understand you may be making a mess of our plans... to put Laine Hanson into the vice president mansion."
"Right now, sir, I cannot see supporting Laine Hanson."
- How old are you?
"- Me, I'm 28."
"And at that age and experience, you think you're the one to sit and judge Mrs. Hanson?"
The wolf is by nature a pack animal and one of the few proud members of the animal kingdom that mates for life.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
"Hello, Jen."
"Welcome, Jennifer."
Thank you.
"For you, the noble honeybee."
The honeybee is committed.
"And though it may fly from flower to flower, collecting the sweet, sticky nectar' it has no choice but to return to the hive."
Congratulations.
Thank you.
That's a big-ass bee.
"Finally, Ronnie and David."
I have thought long and hard about this.
I could not decide with my mind.
I had to open my soul to the animal spirits.
"And, finally..."
"Okay, the build-up's killing me."
What do we got here?
Two cheetahs?
Couple of eagles?
You got two lions?
The ass.
You are the ass.
Stubborn and immovable.
The mighty ass tirelessly bears the heavy burden of others.
"But when the ass is on the move, nothing can stop the ass."
Be an ass for your marriage.
Be an ass for your children.
Be an ass for love.
"Thank you, Marcel."
I'm gonna be the biggest ass you've ever seen.
Come on.
It's not much farther.
We're not heading toward any businesses of any kind.
What?
- We have arrived.
- Arrived where?
You are without shame.
"Sookie, you do not have to do this."
What do you mean?
"Feeding my girls, making them happy."
I love doing this.
"Yeah, so feel the love and pass the salt."
- It makes me feel guilty.
- Eating can help drown that.
"Yeah, eat."
I'm gonna eat.
"Can the help sit at the table, too?"
As long as they don't sing folk songs or tell bawdy stories.
What's with Narcoleptic Nate over there?
He's not much of a morning person.
"Now say, 'I can't believe I ate the whole thing. '"
It takes him about an hour to become Jackson.
"- Hey, I had a good idea for the wedding."
- Cool.
Instead of wrapped Jordan almonds things at every place setting...
- what if we wrap up a few Aspirin?
- Aspirin?
For the morning-after hangovers.
- That's funny.
- 'Cause Jordan almonds are so done.
"Jackson, what do you think?"
Aspirin over almonds?
"We didn't quit until five in the morning, so I stayed over."
"Thank you, sir."
"This friend, sir, the lawyer, where can I reach him?"
SID:
Is this a grilling session?
What am I?
Some kind of suspect or something?
"Nothing personal, sir."
I have to ask these routine questions.
"Well, his name is Leo Hart."
But I think you're gonna have trouble contacting him.
He took the plane for Rome at noon.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
We're ready to roll.
"Let's do it then, huh?"
Mark!
Why don't you entertain the Lieutenant while we shoot this.
"I'm sure he's seen this, anyway."
Seen it?
He was in it.
"Yeah, you know, Ward is right."
"Time is my business, you know, and I always know it."
"Oh, boy, am I hung-over today."
I'll be glad when this day's over.
"Hey, what time you got, Lieutenant?"
11:00 on the dot.
Are you kidding?
"Jeez, I paid a thousand smackers for this watch."
I lost five minutes overnight.
"Do you mind, sir?"
I have never seen a thousand dollar watch before.
"Boy, that must be solid gold."
"Well, with any luck we may be in Krems by morning."
Maybe even catch a barge up to Linz.
Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.
Are you starting that again?
Anybody cover?
Somebody step on that crumb.
"We warned you, Sefton."
Sure you warned me.
You were gonna slit the throat of that stoolie.
Here's the knife to do it with.
Only make sure you got the right throat.
We're looking at it.
Hurry up on that door.
"What are you trying to do, gum up the works?"
That's right.
"Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the morning, like Manfredi and Johnson?"
"Look, Sefton,"
I had my hands full keeping these guys from tearing you apart.
"I called it last time, didn't I?"
Are we gonna listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
The Germans know where Dunbar is.
How do they know?
"You told them, Hoffy."
- Who did?
- You did.
Are you off your rocker?
Uh-huh.
Fell right on my head.
Sprechen sie deutsch?
"No, I don't sprechen sie deutsch."
Maybe just one word?
Kaputt?
It's Paul's nephew.
Punk.
- What happened?
- Don't know yet.
"Detective Santos was signed out, that we know."
"But he carried no radio, wore no vest."
- Any backup?
- Zero.
Total breach of department policy.
What was the guy doing?
Taking a meeting with a drug dealer?
You got me.
But it adds up to a dead kid and a dead nephew of the head of the Zapatti family.
"Here's a guy headed for Attica on a 10 to 20, and he cops probation."
Probation?
No jail time?
Probation's a sentence in New York these days.
Which he skips out on 2 years later.
We've been looking for him ever since.
The mayor will want to step up for the wife.
I wouldn't do that if I were him.
"And who are you, again?"
Internal Affairs.
Listen we can bury Santos.
"And if it turns out he was dirty, well good cop turns bad."
Happens all the time.
Sure.
"We'll give him a full-dress funeral, to boot."
Who is she?
A lawyer for the Detective's Endowment Association.
I guess she'll be representing Eddie Santos and his family.
- I was wondering when you'd ask.
I'm just trying to be normal for once but you ruin everything!
You fucking live to fucking embarrass me!
You don't need any help with that!
Whoring yourself!
No... because I learned from the very best
"Why you never strike me as the jealous type, Irina."
How dare you!
What?
She was crying.
I just sat next to her.
She's my daughter!
I don't want you anywhere near her.
"Oh, what makes you so upset?"
You were never the most trivialist mother.
It doesn't suit you.
I think you should leave.
"I'd like that very much, Jakob."
Leave?
"Yes, leave."
I'm sorry for our misunderstanding.
"Beautiful piece of work, kindly donated by Lorenzo Quid... with the added bonus that he will personally hand deliver it to your home!"
and maybe stay for dinner.
"Ezcellent, let's start the bidding at 90."
Do I have any advances on 90?
"So, any advances on 90?"
"Thank you, Madame!"
Do I see 95?
Why did you do that?
What?
Dominique...
I didn't do.
You know what I mean.

It's back to normal.
[Emma] Yeah.
Oh look.
[Emma] Everything looks great.
How is everything?
"Oh, uh, almost back to normal."
Now all we need is a teacher.
Where's Mr. Burley?
Yeah...
Let me take care of that.
Mr. Burley?
Mr. Burley!
Are you okay?
I'm good.
But my crypto-zoological prizes must be saved.
Here.
Let me help you with that.
Phew.
"Thank you, Noah."
How can I ever repay you?
You can get out there and start teaching again.
Your students need you.
Hey.
Mr. Burley.
"Around this time last year, I asked the question, which species will outlast all others?"
"One particular student said that if humans work together, they can achieve anything."
You all proved that to be true.
I could not be more proud of each and every one of you.
"It's very clear that when faced with great adversity, the human spirit will always prevail."
College for five kids won't be cheap.
We're having three.
It won't matter if you're not around for the honeymoon.
I'll be around.
It's gonna be the best years of our lives.

- Three.
"Okay, we've found them."
- You see anything?
- Besides two scoundrels in love?
"No, but they might have something off-site."
I'm gonna go toss their room.
Call me if you see them chewing on a rabbit's foot or adjusting a magic girdle.

- Careful!
- Stop yelling!
- Start listening!
- I'm so running over your toes.
- Just get it straight.
Not like that!
- Okay!
- Can you close the door?
- Got it.
You know what?
"Pull all the Dodgson files, would you?"
"And anything that's got a listed cross-reference, like Alice Liddell, Lewis Carroll."
- What are you still standing here for?
- I'm not your girl Friday.
What kept you?
Three pumpkin pies and a broken oven thermostat you keep promising to fix.
What's this?
- This is why I called you.
And I feel snake eyes.
"Krause, give Mr. Murdock back the dice he had bef ore."
"I'd be delighted to have you roll f or any part, or all of the 16,000."
Let's say all of it.
- Four.
"- A difficult point, Mr. Murdock."
"What man has done, Murdock can do."
"- Please, Rip, I'm 16,000 ahead."
- Bother you?
A solid winning every now and then is the best advertising f or any casino.
- Can't we have a nightcap?
- lt's your money.
We'll have it in my office.
"If it's all the same to you, I'd like that pair f or a souvenir."
Much obliged.
"With all that money on you, I'd better see you home."
Snake eyes again.
Krause is a f ool.
My cutting him in on the profits was a mistake.
He's becoming greedy.
I'll keep these to remind me never to stretch my luck.
"A judicious principle. I gather that you've been around, as the saying is."
- East St. Louis is around enough.
"- Ah, St. Louis."
"In what business were you, may I ask?"
"I owned taxicabs, but they got sunk at Pearl Harbor."
- Then you know Al Baretto?
- You know Al?
Were you in St. Louis?
"Many times, although my headquarters were in Detroit."
I thought Al's Detroit f riends were all mobsters.
Where's Mike?
Teach me secretly.
Training for the lower body builds strength and agility.
The arms extend from the shoulder blades.
The force generated there ejects your fist like a bullet.
A vertical axis extends through your body.
The basic principle is to be aware of it.
"feel the axis, relax and with smooth, flowing movements take a fighting stance."
Then...
One more time.
Stand still.
Keep the axis straight and the body flowing.
This is the most difficult and important exercise.
Since when have you...
Since forever.
I have a question.
What?
Why do you Iike wushu?
I've always loved it.
It's never been a burden.
shaolin Kung Fu makes people happy.
But Shaolin Kung Fu is a fighting art.
You're wrong.
It's the art of protection.
It's difficult.
That's why I need to know.
My mission is to spread the art of Shaolin.
Here?
"Yes, here."
This is my home.
Everything starts here.
Home?
"Yes, a home."
- Please.
Don't Varun.
You are the only friend that I have left.
I don't want your name in the moneylender's list.
Forget this issue.
Also ask your dad not to borrow any money for your wedding.
Because I have no demands from my side.
Don't get me wrong that I'm... taking advantage of your situation.
I was actually waiting for you today...
To propose.
All these arrangements were meant for that.
Deepa.
I'm visually challenged.
If that's the reason for your silence...
You can tell me frankly.
We can drop this right now.
And remain friends.
Other than that...
There can be no reason for rejecting me.
Because...
I'm handsome...
Charming...
I know it myself.
Hey!
"You did laugh, didn't you?"
I didn't.
Don't you think that we have reached here a bit early today?
"Don't play around, Varun."
It's getting late.
It's not fair to leave me halfway.
I'm going to be with you throughout my life.
"Okay, bye."
"Sorry, I already set the alarm for the night."
"But, Sadie!"
"I've been gone so long, and all the food in our house went bad."
And I'm just starving.
"Um, I think fish Pizza is still open."
I don't know if I'm hungry enough for a meal.
But you're starving?
"No, I'm dying!"
Blegh!
"Well, if you're dead now,"
I guess you can't come by tomorrow.
I won't be dead then!
What happens tomorrow?
"If you didn't know, we started baking our own donuts after that workplace-safety lawsuit got thrown out."
"So if you get here tomorrow right when the shop opens, you can have the very first, fresh donut of the day."
What an honor!
"First thing tomorrow, I'll be here right when the store opens to taste your first delicious donut of the day!"
"Yeah, sure."
"Later, Steven!"

"Mm, 6:55 A.M."
That should give me enough time to get to the big donut right when it opens at 7:00.

-Give them up for dead.
Silence!
"I have to admit, you've got balls, drawing at a time like this."
"-If I don't draw, I'll shit myself right now."
"Ah, no, then you'd better keep drawing."
The art still unpainted if I die now...
The museums won't be the same.
Have I ever told you that you're an egomaniac?
I said silence!
Don't touch her.
"Thank you, Juan."
I owe you one.
Where is Espínola?
What are we going to do now?
Go to plan B.
"But, has anyone calculated how history could change... if we kill Hitler?"
Yes.
But knowing what he did it might make it better.
Are you sure about doing this?
Yes.
"If the Germans are in the Ministry, there won't be too many here."
They're good soldiers.
"Relax, we aren't too bad ourselves."
(HABLA EN ALEMÁN)
He's wondering how everything's going out there.
(Machine gun fire)
I think he should be more worried about what's going on here inside.
(Machine gun fire)
Silence!
No one move.

"Uh, what-"
- Wait a minute.
Where are you taking them?
"Come on, Tyrus, what are you doing?"
I'm putting them on a bus.
Why?
What bus?
One that takes them back to Honduras.
"Hey, wait a second."
Wait a minute.
Th-Th-This was my idea.
Don't punish them.
"You tell Gus to blame me, not them."
He does.
"Give us a minute, will you?"
We won't be too long.
The crew that hit our truck gave away the cargo to a couple of local nobodies.
"Very disciplined, though, not keeping anything for themselves."
"It was all about sending a message, which they did, literally."
It was written on the bucket lid.
"""Ready to talk?"""
"That, I believe, is the English translation."
"I know you're not really asking for advice, but let me hire 10, 15 more good operators, and we hit them back, hit them hard, hit them where they live."
No.
This war stays cold for now.
What about their message?
What's the answer?
Set up a meeting.
Let's see what they have to say.
-l don't want your fucking gun.
"If I was gonna kill you, I would have done it a long time ago."
(sobbing)
MAN:
You'll do exactly what we want.
You'll broadcast my numbers because now you know every choice has a consequence.
(REWlNDlNG)
You'll do exactly what we want.
You'll broadcast my numbers because now you know every choice has a consequence.
My cell phone.
My cell phone's in your glove-box.
We can use it to call for help.
Doesn't help much with the guys waiting outside that door.
"Yeah, but there are three voices on the recording, right?"
"The one who attacked us, the one who was dead in the basement."
And one guy who will watch outside.
Maybe.
Yeah.
Lock yourself in.
It's the only secure room we got left.
(locking DOOR)
OPERATOR:
is she dead?
"Yes, it's done."
Come upstairs.
Leave the door open and drive away.
Welcome to early retirement.
"God, Meredith."
Please.
(sighs)
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God, these are them."
"Yeah, well, let 'em rumble."
We're in the clear.
"You trust me, right?"
"As long as the circle stays tight, no one can break us."
"We're family, right?"
What?
- Company.
- Take care of it.
Who are you?
!
Amanda Kane.
Reporter?
- I've been tracking you and your whole crew.
- How long?
- Six months... long enough for me to expose you and your circle of dirty cops.
North beach bribery scandal is about to blow wide open.
"No proof, no story."
"Oh, I've got names, photos, e-mails, drop-offs..."
The story's happening.
I've done my homework.
You're not like the others.
"Those cops are a disgrace to the uniform, but you were top of your class."
Where'd you go wrong?
You'll never know.
What was it?
Get out of here.
Go!
Townsend agency Today
"Oh, for a middle-aged mob accountant, you guys, that guy was pretty fast."
"Yes, but you did run him down in 6-inch Louboutins."
Color me impressed.
Why do I miss all the good stuff?
Worth 30000/- i though you would give at least 100000/-.
Whey?
"Did you knew, i will give you money?"
Yeah... do i look parrot from my face?
Parrot!
"Muna, Papu take all the stuff from this house."
"T.V., fridge, sofa... washing machine and every thing."
"Take that swing too, i like it"
"M.M. Munday, Murli Manhoowar Munday, not less not too much, take half... see she has bundle of cash... take all the stuff of this girl."
Leave the money and go you way.
You will scare me with that?
"I wont spare you, and you too."
One minute uncle... put finger in you ear.
Why?
Go ahead... sit...
why?
Yeah?
This girl is your sister from now on.
Understand Munday?
"M.M. Munday, Murli Manhoowar Munday, not less not too much,"

From today if she has any problem then i will beat you like hell.
How!
What are you talk brother.
Listen!
Last nail of coffin...
listen completely what i am saying.
What?
"If you ask her for money or ever threaten her... then i swear upon my mother, i will shoot from Mumbai, and it will hit on you back."
And on 26th July 2005.
You will be laying on the road like dead cow.
Understand?
- Now your turn.
- I Arthur.
I can't argue with that.
[Screams]
"Is that you, Arthur?"
- Yes!
- No need for raised voices.
"Look, Tick, there's this obscene monster who lives next door and wants to clone you and take over the world."
Are you sure you're the real Arthur?
"Oh, come on!"
"Tick, please let me go."
"- It's locked, Tick."
"- Stand back, Arthur."
I'll take care of the door.
Merciful heavens!
Too late!
Too late!
Too late!
Too late!
Euch!
[Whimpers] What horror is this?
"[Thrakkorzog] So, mighty Tick, at last we meet."
It's nice to finally get to know the neighbors.
"I am Thrakkorzog, evil ruler of Dimension 14 B."
Allow me to introduce your successor.
I was a bit worried at first.
"I mean, he is a little mucus-intensive, but you work with what you've got."
"Enough prattle, villain."
"I don't mind a little science, but no one mucks around with the Tick's membranes."
Prepare for swift justice!
Oh-ho!
"So, foul gelatin, you would do battle with the nose of your birth?"
"You think you hate it now, but wait `tiII you drive it."
I don`t want to drive it.
"I just want my old car back, okay?"
I`m not falling for this bit.
No way.
"Let`s go, Russ."
"clark, is that the right car?"
"No, it isn`t, honey."
I changed my mind.
They flattened our old car like a pancake.
Are you serious?
"Is this really our car, Dad?"
What happened?
I thought we were going to get the little Sportswagon.
"Oh, no!"
The Sportswagon`s much too small.
"Besides, I got a great deal on this one."
"If we`re taking the whole tribe cross-country believe me, this is your automobile."
Why is it still running?
"Oh, all new cars do that."
I`II take care of that in a second.
"You may think you hate it now, but wait until you drive it."
An air bag!
"You know, clark, it`s not too late to fly out to california."
We only have two weeks.
"Let`s not get into that again, sweetie pie."
please?
"Lots of families fly, clark."
especially cross-country.
The whole idea of a family vacation is to be together as a family.
"On a plane, you put on earphones and you`re lost in your own world."
"It`s a very long ride, clark."
We have a match and a name - Denny Lorton.
Calls himself Pica.
He has form.
Sexual assault 30 years ago.
"God, this being a detective is easy."
The dead boy is Benjamin Rigby.
15 years old.
He's been selling himself for 18 months or so.
Had he been reported missing?
Mum's a junkie.
That lane was his beat.
Is this Lorton?
Reckon they can make this room any uglier?
Probably not.
It's like they think no-one actually has to work in here.
Why do we settle for ugly like it doesn't matter?
"A bit of colour there, painting there."
Some flowers.
I'm wasted in this profession.
"Pick this creep up, will ya?"
Tommy. (Whistles)
Hmm...
Hmm...
"Strictly cash these days, Manos."
Since when?
Since I woke up in a strange hotel room with third degree burns on my arse and no idea how they got there.
"I owe you big-time, mate."
"If you change your mind, give us a tinkle."
(Phone rings)
Red.
Good morning's work.
You humiliate a young cop and keep that clump of sink hair out of prison.
- All for you.
A $25 savings bond.
That's a long-term investment.
"Don't touch it for 30 years, you're looking at $45."
- A youth hostel card.
- For the young girl... who doesn't mind sharing a bathroom with strangers.
'What Color Is Your Parachute?
A practical manual for job hunters. '
Helping you answer:
What you wanna do and where you wanna do it.
A DVD of The Graduate.
Got to have that.
The Portable Nietzsche.
"Light, cheery reading."
An application to join the armed forces.
"If your dreams don't pan out, it's a viable option."
And something in a nice little velvet box.
A necklace.
The pearl almost looks real.
"It better look very real, because it is."
- That's not funny.
- This is not a funny gift.
"Christopher, this is extremely not funny."
This is totally humorless.
It's beautiful.
"I think you're awesome, Lor."
"With everything you do, and raising Rory the way you did... you're superwoman."
Have a great day.
Wish I could be there.
Take lots of pictures for me.
The camera.
I forgot the camera.
Not much left of him.
It's gonna take 24 hours to get the DNA they got from Lau's body processed.
Harry?
Kalim intimated that Freddie Lau was going to be killed.
"- Kalim, owner of the Pleasure Palace?"
- Yeah.
Fenchurch's boss.
He hinted that someone was trying to muscle out Freddie but Freddie wasn't listening.
Maybe the two murders are connected.
"Kayleigh's murder was so precise - no DNA, they drop her in the Thames."
Freddie Lau's body is just dumped in an alleyway.
It's sloppy.
Check out the CCTV in Soho the night Freddie died.
We might be able to pick up his movements.
I've got a croupier to find.
"You're a hard man to track down, JC."
I need your help with something.
"Get lost, Harry."
It's my down time.
- Ah!
What the hell are you doing?
- I'm your new personal trainer.
Ah-ah!
"The tall guy the other night in the casino, the one that got chucked out - what's his name?"
"- You can't do this, Harry."
- This is just a warm-up.
What's his name?
The one that was screaming for Freddie Lau?
"All right, stop."
His name's Kevin Grey.
He used to be on the staff but he got chucked off a couple of months ago.
- Why?
"Oversteered a little bit, but that's why you gotta--"
Not let him drive?
"What, are you nuts?"
Oh.
"Oh, he was fine."
Dad let us drive.
We turned out okay.
You wanna rephrase that?
"Okay, uh..."
Dad let we drive.
Us turned out okay.
"Is that what you're looking for, grammar police?"
"Rusty, you can't disappoint a kid, then make up for it by stuffing him with ribs and taking him out to do something illegal and dangerous."
Oh. (Chuckles) Brick's happy.
"Sure, until the next thing comes along that you miss."
"Look, you're in and out of our lives, and I get tired of making excuses about where you are or why you're not around."
The kids ask about you.
"I say, ""oh, you know Uncle Rusty,"""
but they don't.
Brick.
"(Clears throat) Listen, uh..."
"You know, just 'cause I don't, uh, show up for things, well, that-- that doesn't mean that I don't care for ya."
"Hey, I got ribs, bowling, a driving lesson, and extra credit."
I'm all good.
(Chuckles) Yeah.
Same goes for you.
(Door creaks)
"(Switch clicks) Hello, mother."
(Gasps)
Is there something you'd like to tell me?
I'm sorry!
(Panting)
Your mom and dad have no time for you.
"On the other hand, grandma will make sure you never go wanting."
- What's this?
- A gift for you.
- Another one?
- Won't you open it?
What is it?
"I picked something different, to see if you like it."
You hardly ever play with your toys!
This old lady is yours.
"When you feel like hearing a story, she will tell you one."
We can get people as presents?
She is the greatest storyteller around.
Don't you like stories?
"When you're tired of reading, just say ""tell me"", and she will."
Isn't that great?
Talk to my grandchild.
Hello.
How do they call you?
The Storytelling Lady.
"Grandma, you can buy people?"
- Is it expensive?
"- Depends, I guess."
Are there people stores?
"There's no such thing, my angel."
So how did you-
You're impossible when you get something in your head!
"You want me to talk, right?"
"Talk, not ask."
It's time for grandma to get some rest.
Stay here and play with your new toy.
Don't be shy.
- Are you lost?
- Yes
"Here, with you ... is not like a movie or in books, where everything is clear ... expected ... organized ... with a clear purpose."
"Everything is chaos, unexpected ... pain ... disorder ..."
"So I try to have them in the order, fans of my mother."
I am missing one.
- Do you want stories?
- No.
Why?
To know my life.
There is no life.
There is only war.
Listen.
I do not feel anything.
Close your eyes.
Marie ...
Marie ...
"You fly, my friend, cadrai you."
We prepare the fall.
Do you have exaggerated.
"If I were human, the kill here, immediately."
But I will not be human.
I have a word myself.
"I do not want you to hurry, but there is a theater in precise time."
"Even the mail, on the other hand ... for parcels ..."
I am sending them.
The exact delivery time.
I still have ... for new addresses.
And I am always me ...
Get a little 'of breath.
We must start now.
"Do not take it, Leon."
- Everything's fine up here.
- OK.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
"José, could you come here for a minute, please?"
- It looks as if a whole army is rolling up.
- These are just the supplies for the base.
"- Shouldn't we hold off on the attack, then?"
- No.
How do you know that those bastards won't shoot when we show our faces?
Plenty of people in the valley know that we're going to blow up the dam.
- Why did you warn them?
- Because it's them that I'm fighting for.
Are you wetting yourself?
Nonsense!
- You'll be relieved in three hours.
- All right.
"Soon, all hell will break loose here."
Now.
Watch out.
That's Moreno over there.
We can't hold our position much longer.
Understood.
Headquarters are going to send us helicopters.
"You should get out of here, with the other engineers."
Attention!
Calling position...
We can go down now.
Come on!
The rope!
"Hey, careful."
Don't shoot.
"Which is good, 'cause we can use it."
We're going to have to get
My dad thinks we should get off the streets.
Why ?
Did he hear something ?
About aftershocks or looters or...
Zombies ?
"I know, that was my first thought, too."
"But no, it's just a precaution."
It's Ryan.
Is everyone okay ?
"Yeah, we just have to make a little change of plans."
Hmm ?
"* California, here we come *"
* Right back where we started from *
* California...
California... *
Your dad said to go home.
But I think we should all be together.
This is a bad idea.
We're almost there.
"No, we're not."
It's just a few more minutes.
"Well, I know where my house is okay ?"
"Look, I command you to stop this bike."
"I'm sorry, okay but I'm starting to get a little creeped out."
"Not that I don't want to play Pictionary by candlelight and raid Taylor's Apocalypse kit, but I think we should just go to your house."
"Okay, but I'm still awaiting on news of Pancakes."
Pancakes ?
You said Ryan said everyone was fine.
"I know, but I don't know that he included rodents in his head count, so I texted him to be sure."
And ?
Sorry.
"I'm just, uh, I'm just a little distracted."
Because?
Because the...
"""The None"" is launching, and Alexis owes me a draft of the third chapter."
It's four days late.
Julianne is breathing down my back.
"And, of course,"
I forgot to pick up the dry cleaning.
Again.
"Plus we got the hydro bill, and it's crazy this month."
Yeah.
Anything else you wanna stress about?
Point taken.
"Hey, I'll pick up the dry cleaning."
It's gonna be ok.
It always is.
Thanks.
"We think of them as solid, immutable."
"The world may change around us, but our relationships?"
They remain constant.
"No, and I agree."
"I think that the orgasm chapter is compelling, but I feel like it's coming too soon in the book."
"Uh, no pun intended, I hope."
And chapter three?
"Where's that one, exactly?"
"Uh, I'm hoping it's in my inbox."
"Hey, what're you doing here?"
"Just, uh..."
I didn't sleep last night.
I kept thinking about what you said.
And I realized that this was a big mistake--
We are stronger...
What are you ?
Some goddamn wind-up tin soldier ?
- This is my wife we're talking about.
- I know who she is !
And I have known her and cared about her a hell of a lot longer than you !
You can do whatever the frak you want !
I am going after my wife !
"Missiles are loaded, Admiral."
Open launch tube doors.
"Doors are open, Admiral."
What are you doing ?
Getting ready to nuke the planet.
Radiological detection.

- He's bluffing.
"- I can't let you do that, Sam."
- I am not asking you for permission.
Sergeant Mathias.
Load target package three-bravo.
Set ground zero for the underground structure.
Are we prepared to sacrifice Lee ?
They're loading a targeting package.
It's a bluff.
Don't let him rattle you.
The risk to us is unacceptable.
Turn back the Raiders.
The ships cannot turn back.
He won't launch it.
And D'Anna was explicit that she and Baltar make it to the planet's surface.
"So, is that what all this is really about ?"
"""And the heavens opened up, and they saw the eye."""
We don't live far from here.
thanks.
- That would be lovely!
My name is Dr. Rice.
But you can call me Zander if you like.
My colleague tells me you've been somewhat resistant.
He believes you've been dispensing delayed information to allow your friends to stay one step ahead.
I'm offering you the possibility...
Caliban. save your friends.
The girl is a rather small price to pay for that.
she's impure.
She wasn't made by nature.
She's a mistake of my own.
I did what I could and they burned me and beat me.
Your colleagues are savages.
I agree.
The Reavers were very ineffective.
But I'm bringing new tools to bear.
But I still need someone to point us in the right direction.
I can't help you.
breathe.
what does he have?
The old man.
Alzheimer's?
ALS?
A degenerative brain disease in the world's most dangerous brain?
What a combo.
you know we got company.
{\i1\cH80ffff}That's wonderful.
have a seat.
sit up.
why don't you sit at the end of the table?
"But that, no."
It isn't clean!
"You can catch germs in no time,"
licking just anyone like that.
What happened after that?
"After Touchy, Ducky and the Morin girl arrived."
They came from the hotel.
"We turned to look, we saw this kid crossing the street, he almost got hit and jumped into the field."
"Ducky got out of his car, all excited."
He came up to us and asked:
"Touchy, what was that?"
"- A black guy, I think."
"...Touchy said, coming out of his truck."
Ducky was looking all around.
"Touchy saw that I had gun, so flicking his hair, he said:"
I'm gonna go catch him!
And he ran in the corn behind the kid.
"Ducky stayed with us, saw the statue and went..."
"He looked at me, then turned to the field."
Nothing was moving in there.
"Nothing at all, at all."
Ducky started yelling:
Touchy!
No answer.
"He was getting scared, he said:"
Was he alone?
How should I know?
They hang out in gangs.
It was no joke.
We were all staring at the corn field... even the Morin girl... who was quite... quite drunk.
Ducky was getting more nervous.
"Touchy, did you catch him?"
"Wilson, Cats, let's go."
Christo.
Yep.
"When the footage comes in, overlay it on the gris map."
"We get lucky, maybe we can trace Valera's escape route."
You got it.
All surveillance cam footage from the 900 block of Shortridge.
Thank you.
Any idea just how many cameras big brother's got pointed on downtown Atlanta?
"8,200, give or take."
Excellent.
I need this.
Make it happen.
I'll download the SANs and work it up.
Graham.
"Max Collins said he didn't know his mother was in town, right?"
Lab just ran prints lifted from Jessica's hotel suite.
We got a hit.
"Max, it's your fingerprints."
This isn't what you think.
What were you doing in your mother's hotel room?
She wanted to talk.
About what?
About Sara.
"Whether you guys were still happy, same as always."
"Since when do you two have an ""always"" kind of relationship?"
"What do you want me to say, Dad?"
"She was a crappy mom, but for the last six months, she's been trying to make up for it!"
She wants to be a part of my life!
Okay.
Do you have any idea where she is now?
No.
"Anyway, uh, Serena might be a little upset."
"Well, you were right."
She can stay in Charles' room.
It's getting crowded around here.
No kidding.
"Throw in your ex-husband,"
And now we're a Nancy Meyers movie.
I hope you don't mind.
I know it's awkward.
"Well, I mean, it is a little unusual, don't you think,"
For a doctor to move in to his patient's building?
"Well, not if he's the father of the patient's children."
What are you getting at?
Is it possible that...
Will's also trying to get close to you?
Absolutely not.
I'm the one that told William to stay away
If he couldn't make good
On the promises he made to the children.
And I'm sorry if this is uncomfortable for you.
"But if William wants to move in to be closer to the kids,"
I'm not gonna stand in his way.
Mmm.
Holland?
"Hi, it's Rufus."
Um...
I have a favor to ask.
...And the social scene at N.Y.U. Was criminal.
"Ten freshmen, a keg"
And a tub of hummus on a card table isn't a party.
It's a tragedy.
Hmm.
- How very impressive.
- Would you like to buy it?
- Do you want to sell it to me?
- Yes.
- How much?
"1,000 kroner."
"That's the best 1,000 kroner I've ever spent."
My colleague is a quite the art expert.
He'll be very impressed.
"- Hi, Frank."
- Well?
- It's mouth painted.
- But why?
I bought it from a crippled lady who paints with her mouth.
Impressive.
"- But still, it's a shitty painting."
- I think it's very... mouthy.
"- But impressive, eh?"
"- ""Mouthy"", you said it!"
- I'm happy.
- But you can't hang it anywhere.
The office.
You've got that...
It's not really office material.
We have people coming by and...
I'm at a stage in my life where I'm fascinated by the orally competent.
- Why?
- Mia says my technique is dull.
- She says you give bad head?
- That's another way to put it.
"I'm like a fiery Arab, and you're more the dray horse."
You toss your long tongue into her beaver.
Great.
Let's go this way.
How do you know it's that way?
[âª]
"All this time,"
And I don't know where to begin.
You can't just decide to change your life
And expect to make up for
All the ruined years of mine.
"No, you're right."
"I can't deny my past, andreas."
"What I did, I did."
But you were a fool
To take on the gural nataz.
You had what you wanted.
You knew the dagger and sheath
Would lead you to the astronomicons.
And they had you.
You still don't believe that
"I had exchanged them for you, do you?"
I understand your doubt.
My misdeeds have led to this.
"Physical scars change my appearance,"
But nothing compares to what has
Happened to me on the inside.
"All those days facing death,"
I came to realize that
Nothing mattered more to me...
Than you.
[âª]
Hello.
These symbols may very well describe
I can see through... anything.
May I help you?
Where's Vanessa?
Vanessa?
What can she do for you that I can't do?
"I can do everything she do, honey, and a whole lot better."
"Walking around here, thinking she cute... showing them little pencil legs."
"Honey, I seen better legs on a pool table."
And another thing...
"Vanessa this, Vanessa that..."
talking about how cute she is.
I've seen something at the zoo cuter than she was.
"Come on, get in there with your half-dead self."
Thank you.
Let me tell you something.
Here's my phone number.
"Call me, sweetie."
"We can get together, have champagne at my house."
"The bubbly kind, you know?"
"And I got one of them little bikini nighties, you know?"
See-through.
"We now run the market in D.C., Baltimore... and Philadelphia."
"At the rate we're going, in three months... we'll be ready to make the move on New York... because if I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere."
Goldilocks.
"Hello, Mr. Byers."
How are you?
That's great.
The boat comes in tonight.
You brought me back something?
Nothing.
We're just about to have lunch.
Hey!
"- Well, I hope and pray it's not her."
I have so few quality girls left.
"Oh, um..."
How long did Belshazzar last?
Till the end of the night.
(CLEARS THROAT)
"The prosecution have painted the defendant as a jealous ex-husband, as a cruel man with a vicious temper."
A ticking emotional time bomb just waiting to go off.
"I like paintings, but pretty as they are, they have absolutely no place in a court of law."
(SIGHS)
"It's been a very long trial, hasn't it?"
Let me give you the good news.
This is the last speech you will hear on this case.
I just want to focus on one word.
Doubt.
(CHEERING)
BARRISTER:
See you on Monday.
I'll catch up with you later.
Harry!
You...
I...
Were we supposed to meet today?
"- No, no."
I was just passing.
- Oh.
Um...
You were very impressive in there.
The faces on the cops said it all.
"Yeah, well, they've been an absolute joke."
"Shit, sorry."
They're probably your friends.
I was thinking ifyou could talk...
- No.
"No way, Mr Daaga."
Vijay is a police officer.
And I am a lawyer.
It has happened many times before.
"He has arrested many criminals, and I have freed them."
But our friendship still prevails because he hasn't questioned me about my profession.
Nor I have interfered in his work.
And...
"Think ofthe devil, and here he is!"
We must leave.
Where were you all these days?
-Right here.
Shall we play a set?
ARer them.-l have taken one more case ofyours.
Balwant's.
You arrested him.
You are on to it?
- Yes.
Go ahead.
But his chances are grim.
- We'll see that in court.
Why did you take up this case?
-Come on!
It's my profession.
You know he's a first rate criminal.
Still you... lt's not for us to decide if he is guilty or decent.
Let the court decided over it.
You won't improve.
My client Mr Balwant Singh works for Roshan Electricals.
"On the 15th he was on his way to the bank to deposit 25,OOO in the company's account."
Okay.
"Oh, yes."
One minor note here.
Andy's birthday party has been moved to today.
Wait a minute here!
What do you mean the party?
's today?
His birthday's not 'til next week!
What's goin' on down there?
Is his mom losing' her marbles?
"Well, obviously she wanted to have the party?"
before the move.
I'm not worried.
You shouldn't be worried.
Of course Woody ain't worried.
He's been Andy's favourite since kindergarten.
"Hey, hey."
"Come on, Potato Head."
"If Woody says it's all right, then, well, darn it, it's good enough for me."
Woody has never steered us wrong before.
"Come on, guys."
Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
"But what ifAndy gets another dinosaur, a mean one?"
I just don't think I could take that kind of rejection!
"Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced."
This is Andy we're talking about.
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.
What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.
"That's what we're made for, right?"
Pardon me.
"I hate to break up the staff meeting, but... they're here!"
Birthday guests at three o'clock!
- I...?
Something's always the problem with you.
"Today, I've missed... the train, thanks to you."
- To me...?
I wish to make it to Zurich on time.
"So you go your way, I'll go mine"
Strange!
"We're fellow-travelers, on the same destination, same train"
Why split up?
"Besides, aman like me ought to stay with a girl like you"
Wrong!
A girl like me doesn't need a guy like you.
Stop pursuing me
I'll sew it up.
I have a thread and needle.
I'll buy you anew dress
What have you got yourself into?
I told you not to pursue me!
Who do you think you are?
What do you think of yourself?
I wasn't pursuing you
And I don't fancy touching you.
Thank your stars I came in the nick of time
"Else, you would've been in jail."
"I help her, and she says this"
"Hey, take her away"
What did you say?
I got carried away
"Never mind Senorita, never mind."
"In big places, such small things happen"
What's about this Senorita?
- My first girl friend was from Spain
"Now explain to me again why you're undercover in silk escada,"
- ...and I'm in itchy cotton work clothes.
- Life is so unfair.
"Yeah, well, next mission, we are so trading thread counts."
- Your drink miss?
- Thank you.
"- Eve, you in position?"
- Sitting tight by the pool deck.
"- Eve, that sounded like a mojito."
Piña Colada.
I take my cover very seriously.
"All right, guys."
Time to find out what happened to Amanda Kane.
- Who are you?
- I.T.
I didn't call I.T.
Of course you didn't.
You're not authorized to.
But let's not whip out our pay grades.
It'll only embarrass you.
I'm sorry.
I'm here to fix the bugs in your system.
There's no bugs in my system.
"Yeah, well, you might want to double-check that, sport."
"Yeah, I'm gonna need about 20 minutes to run a full diagnostic."
Might be faster if you sync up with me from the port side.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
"- Okay, Bos."
I'm in.
- Copy that.
Starting the download now.
"- It's because you're ill, isn't it?"
- What?
That you agreed to...
You know.
I never heard of someone killing themselves because they had angina.
"But it's not, though, is it?"
It's not just angina.
"So, what is it, then?"
- What?
"- All right, it's not just angina."
"So, what, then?"
It's terminal.
That's all you need to know.
"I don't want to die in some piss-stinking nursing home, surrounded by people dribbling and making farm noises."
"Whether I've got six months or six years, it's not gonna be some fucking golden age."
It'll be shite.
Every day worse than the last.
I won't have it.
"I'm going out when I say, not when they decide to pull the fucking plug."
"I'm a stubborn, selfish bastard."
I wanna choose when I die.
"Therearewarningsofgales in Forties, Cromarty, Forth, Tyne, Dogger,"
"Fisher, German Bight..."
Change of plan.
"Oh, look, Paul... no."
Wait...
listen...
- Eh!
How are you?
"- All right, yeah."
"It's not too loud, is it?"
Not at all.
And I would aid in the effort.
And be welcomed for it.
Come.
Keep him still until we return.
"A little wine, if seized by fit."
Drink.
Move Tullius' wine from sight.
"Apologies, Domina."
I would have permission to see Gannicus.
You ask this now?
I know he is to be sold tomorrow.
"I would have final words, before he departs."
I would share drink with an old friend.
Is that all I am?
A friend?
Gannicus...
I do not care for honey in my wine.
It serves only to mask bitter taste.
A blessing in such moments.
You are to be sold to Tullius.
Oenomaus warned of it should I fall to Crixus.
You let Crixus win.
Why would you do such a thing?
"Because I cannot stay within these walls, to gaze upon you every day and be denied your touch."
"I have never turned from challenge, yet I am without strength to face this one."
Then it is for the best.
"Because, despite my words,"
I stand as weak.
I want no wine.
Medicus gave order.
Drink.
Should help you rest.
Well...
"Well, Mr Diamonds said, ""Hey, go take the afternoon off."
"""Take a few hours off."
"You deserve it."""
You know what that's called?
It's called esteem.
Esteem for loyalty.
"I mean, I don't..."
"I don't need time off, cos anything could happen when I'm not covering his back."
"He could be talking to other bodyguards, for instance."
"Yeah, right?"
"I mean, I'm not concerned as such, I'm not concerned, because, well, I'm..."
"I'm that guy, that one-in-a-thousand kind of a guy."
I'm that guy that will go the distance.
I will go all the way.
They no respect for the dead!
"They no respect for nothing, Michelangelo!"
"Dorothy, Bonnie, they pass on!"
Poor babies.
They just babies!
Like you!
"My daughter, yesterday night, she say she see what you doing on internet."
She say she see me speaking!
"She say, ""Mum, you are famous!"""
But I do not want to be famous!
I want to be invisible!
Invisible!
So you stop now.
"Right now, Michelangelo!"
"Child, you go home."
Please!
Pray to lord for souls of dead!
I'm not from earth.
The people looking for me are getting close.
They also are not from earth.
-What do you...
What do you mean you're not from earth?
I don't...
"- Listen, I care about you deeply."
- Then why are you telling me?
- To protect you.
"-Uh... your ...association with me, I fear I'm putting you in danger as well."
-Danger?
How can you... how can you expect me to believe this?
"Please, just... make me understand."
-Alyssa... there are things... there are worlds outside of this one you have no idea of.
And I am from one of these worlds.
I knew I would never see her again.
I was devastated.
But we are more connected than I even imagined.
She could hear my thoughts.
She could feel my pain in losing her.
-You were... telepathically linked?
-Yes.
Without my intention.
It just happened.
"Soon, we found each other again, and we left together, heading west."
- Then what happened?
- My worst fear.
They found us.
"I managed to get away unharmed, but she was not so fortunate."
-So you're saying that she's...
- Dead?
No.
Sorry.
"Yeah, everybody's sorry."
Abner was sorry for dragging me all over this earth looking for his little bits of junk.
I'm sorry to still be stuck in this dive.
Everybody's sorry for something.
"It's a worthless bronze medallion, Marion."
Are you going to give it to me?
Maybe.
I don't know where it is.
"Well maybe, you can find it."
Three thousand bucks.
Well that would get me back.
But not with style.
I can get you another two when we get to the states.
It's important Marion.
Trust me.
You know the piece I mean?
You know where it is?
Come back tomorrow.
Why?
"Because I said so, that's why."
Ha!
See you tomorrow Indiana Jones!
Good evening freulein.
The Bar is closed.
We... we are not thirsty.
What do you want?
The same thing your friend doctor Jones wanted.
Surely he told you there would be other interested parties?
Must have slipped his mind.
The man is nefarious.
I hope for your sake he has not yet acquired it.
We live together like this.
I see.
I don't see it that way.
You don't call people merely living together a family.
I don't want to talk anymore.
"Get out, Big Brother."
Sure thing.
Sagiri.
What?
This illustration made me really happy.
"Let's do our best together next time, too!"
How stupid.
That was something I only drew out of a sense of obligation.
Yes?
I'm Megumi Jinno!
Is Sagiri-chan here?
Next Episode:
"Class Rep with a Normie Life, and a Fearless Fairy"
"Listen, if you're having any second thoughts, you want to call this off, now is the time."
I don't want to call it off.
"So no ""We're going anywhere"" last looks."
"No tears, no ""I'll miss you most of all, Scarecrow."""
Nothing that anybody can look back on.
"Look, I know how to play my part."
"After you force me to open up the safe, you can't go straight for the cash box."
"You got to grab some of the other shit, too."
Yeah?
Like what?
Anything.
It can't look like you got tipped off what to take.
Take the cash box last.
- Me too.
Tell Carrasco we have heard that Ramírez is planning to visit this province.
- When?
- On Thursday.
He will have half an army with him.
"No, he's taking a plane full of foreign industrialists, in order to show them that everything's quiet here."
- Tell Carrasco that.
- You can count on it.
"- OK, that's all."
Are you ready?
- I've never been readier.
Take care.
- Take care.
Don't let them get you down.
- I'll try.
"- Hey, thanks a lot for everything."
- Good luck.
- Get in.
I hope you can swim.
- Shit!
What's in there?
You've just said it.
"Shit, of course."
"Come on, don't be embarrassed."
Corpses smell worse.
What's the matter?
"I wonder if there will ever be a time when we can think of ourselves, Enrique."
I'm sure there will be.
We'll become two fat bourgeois and get bored.
History's full of revolutionaries who've ended their lives like that.
"Yes, I can picture us sitting on the sofa, watching TV and nibbling nuts."
Why not?
I have one of sprites and goblins.
Sit down and do your best to fright me with your sprites.
There was a man dwelt by a churchyard...
Bear the boy hen;
he shall not me about her.
What is this?
Sport?
Away with him!
Let her sport herself
"With that she's big with, for 'tis Polixenes"
Has made thee swell thus.
She's an adulteress!
"Should a villain say so, the most replenish'd villain in the world"
He were as much more villain.
"You, my lord, do but mistake."
"You have mistook, my lady, Polixenes for Leontes."
Away with her!
To prison!
"Adieu, my lord."
I never wished to see you sorry
Now I trust I shall.
I dare my life lay down that the queen is spotless.
Cease; no more.
"'I have despatch'd to sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple."
Though I am satisfied yet shall the oracle
'Give rest to the minds of others such as he. '
- How does the boy?
- He took good rest tonight.
'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.
"Go, see how he fares."
Away!
Away!
-Satisfied?
-That satchel has a false lid.
"Go on, look."
Somebody put those there.
I am innocent.
"Well, I am afraid we are left no choice."
"J.D., will you assist me in escorting Mrs. Standish to the jail?"
"Ezra, she's your mother."
EZRA:
"Now, you'll have to forgive the appearance..."
... butthemaidquit.
How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child.
"I'm cruel, only that I may be kind, mother."
"After all, you should know better than to steal."
"You know, perhaps some time spent behind bars will be instructional."
Preston Wingo put those cuffs links in my bag.
He's blackmailing me.
"Now, why on Earth would he wanna do that?"
MAUDE:
It's none of your business.
"Come on, judge wants us to ride."
"Well, sleep tight."
Don't let the... .
"Well, you know the rest."
What appears to be the trouble?
chris:
This boy just brought us a message from Judge Travis.
He's over in Eagle Bend trying a colored man for murder.
They're too het up for a fair trial.
Judge wants us to bring the prisoner back.
-All of us?
-Yeah.
He's in... (BLENDER BUZZING) ...The kitchen.
- But talking to him's not gonna be easy.
- Why?
"Walter, we have company."
"Oh, hello, Agent Dunham."
"Walter, hey."
I need you to tell me what you know about the man we call the Observer.
You once referred to him as your friend.
Seems he may have kidnapped a woman.
They called it the Strawberry Supreme.
PETER:
His favorite ice-cream store shut down.
He made me wait in line with him for four hours to get one last milkshake.
They have a secret ingredient.
"It's mundane, but it's..."
"Oh, it's sublime."
And I'm trying to stimulate my olfactory and gustatory senses to try to re-create it.
Walter.
Can you come with me?
OLIVIA:
We've recorded him at over three dozen Fringe events.
- Do you remember him?
WALTER:
Of course.
But there's nothing more than I've told you before.
Peter and I were in a car crash.
In a frozen lake.
When I was a boy.
"We were drowning, and he dove in and saved us."
But you say he's kidnapped a woman?
We think he may have.
Why?
What is this?
"This is the only reason why you're alive, Tris."
"Man, I love knowing stuff that you don't."
"Need you to open up that box, Tris."
The only way to open that box is to pass the sims of all five factions.
But the only people that have tried to do it so far have died. (LAUGHING)
Oops.
I don't think I was supposed to tell you that.
"Oh, Well."
No pressure.
JEANINE:
Remarkable.
"Chances of it being you, of all people."
Nearly defies the laws of probability.
As remarkable as the amount of people you've managed to murder.
Dark times call for extreme measures.
"You may find it hard to believe, but I am serving the greater good."
"Step up on the disk, please."
"Step up on the disk, please."
(PETER GROANS)
(PANTING)
Ma'am?
- Hmm?
-(PETER GROANING)
Oh.
Stop the suicides or I swear I will shoot him.
That's okay.
You can kill him if you want.
We have plenty of guards.
What?
(YELLS)
(GRUNTS)
It's not on?
- No!
When's the last time you let me do some real work?
Not just tidy up after you or James?
"Not merely dispense pills, but real work."
Nuts and bolts vetting.
"- When you're a qualified vet and have some conception of the responsibilities of our profession, which you have not-- you see?"
That's your attitude in a nutshell.
I've heard you out.
Now you hear me out.
You mend that fence.
I see.
"It's like that, is it?"
"You have 24 hours, and not a second longer to mend that fence."
Thank... you.
There's enough fruit in here to start a shop.
Ah-choo!
"- George, please."
"It's this bloody cold, a right dose of bronchitis."
"Would you move back a bit, please?"
"For heaven's sake, Mr. sowden!"
Haven't you ever heard of droplet infection?
"Infection-- you know, from coughs and sneezes."
It's no use fussing.
There's no escaping it.
"He started, all right."
He's off.
"Bronchitis, right enough."
Ha-choo!
Ha-choo!
Hee-hee.
Ah-choo!
- Countdown to show time.
- Yeah.
"- Wait, seriously."
- Look at your little face.
Are you sure?
"This is for posterity, you know."
Okay.
"Anyway, here's my face."
- There's Ari's face.
- I love...
"This is why I love Norah and Caroline, because they love each other."
- It's very sweet.
- We love each other.
That's a cool shot.
It is rare that you get real female...
True female friendship in movies right now.
"Because usually what we get is, sort of, mean girl behavior."
- Yeah.
- It's so true.
"Even, you know..."
"- I'm sorry, you go."
"- No, you go."
"No, I was just gonna say that with Tris, too I feel like even though she come..."
"In certain moments, she comes across as being like you know, antagonistic to Norah or whatever."
But she's just as vulnerable as Norah and Caroline and just wants to be...
- She's human.
"...accepted, like everybody else."
- That's pathetic.
- She does...
It's not like they're never gonna see each other.
"I mean, they all go to school together."
"Caroline and Tris are friends, sort of."
- Stay close to your sets.!
- Oh!
I'm gonna die!
I'm gonna die!
You're not gonna die!
Relax!
Keep shooting!
Think of my Emmy!
"Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape!"
Monkeys.
Fix this damn thing.
Whoo!
Hammond seems to be...
"Bill, Wendy, can you see this?"
Hammond is leading the pursuit in a giant game of ring-around-the-rosy.
"Jack, you anti-hero, if you're going to get away, get away now."
"Bill, this is really ridiculous."
"It's pretty clear now that this guy, Jack Hammond... is just toying with the police."
I hope they put him away for a long time.
- You are dead serious about going with me?
- Serious as a heart attack.
"You are absolutely, positively, 100% sure about this?"
I have never been more sure about anything in my entire life.
- We'll be fugitives.
- Sounds exciting.
- You won't be Natalie Voss anymore.
- Who the hell is she anyway?
I don't know.
I don't know.
But you're going to give up everything for me?
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm doing it for me too.
"- Wait a minute, you're seeing someone?"
- Who is this?
"Dad, this is the reporter from Manhattan Monthly."
"- Ike, this is my dad."
- Whatever.
"Honey, look, what I don't understand is what you see in this guy Scott."
You deserve somebody better than that.
"Someone like, like... like you."
Excuse me.
I really need to ask you a question.
"No, no."
No more questions.
I need to talk to my daughter.
- Are you eligible or not?
- Answer that question.
"Dad, I really want to talk to you about this, but not in front of him."
"Could you give us, like, five minutes?"
Molly has muffins.
And she's very eligible.
"Yeah, she told me."
"Look, last night you said that nothing would make you happier than if I found the right guy."
And you think Scott's the right guy?
No.
I don't know.
It was just one motorcycle ride.
That's it?
A motorcycle ride and a kiss.
And a kiss?
That's not what Johnson saw at the party.
"Yeah, believe it or not, he cracked."
"The point is, it's not serious."
"Like, Scott's going on a blind date tonight, with someone else."
Mmm.
Sorry.
Registration number?
Mmm.
Sorry.
"But I'd recognise the bloke, the driver."
"But I'd recognise the bloke, the driver."
Description?
Description?
"I reckon the bloke was mid-40s, he was wearing a suit."
"I reckon the bloke was mid-40s, he was wearing a suit."
A suit?
"Yeah, a suit."
A suit?
"Yeah, a suit."
"He was clean-shaven, around 5'7"", dark hair, that's it."
"He was clean-shaven, around 5'7"", dark hair, that's it."
Ever heard of a hitman walking into a country town
Ever heard of a hitman walking into a country town wearing a bag of fruit?
wearing a bag of fruit?
"I think we should shoot over there,"
"I think we should shoot over there, see if we can find ourselves a witness."
see if we can find ourselves a witness.
"Jerilderie's a three-hour drive, mate."
You'd have to overnight it.
"Jerilderie's a three-hour drive, mate."
You'd have to overnight it.
I'm game.
Boss?
I'm game.
Boss?
Any time you like.
The Treasure of Atlantis lies somewhere in that crater.
Looks inviting.
"The last time they had a major eruption, it destroyed half the island, along with Atlantis."
Beautiful.
Simon?
Simon!
"Oh, God, no."
This is Cleeve's doing.
"He has a concussion, possibly a subdural hematoma."
"I can do more when we get him to a hospital in Athens, but he's too weak to move."
All I can do now is make him comfortable.
"Well, don't worry."
I'll stay with him.
(speaks in Greek)
(speaks in Greek)
Looks like he's going to be all right.
And the doctor's going to stay with him until he's well enough to be moved.
But all the maps and the charts of the volcano have gone.
Damn.
Cleeve and Zavros are probably in the crater by now.
"Tonight the planets align, and they'll steal the treasure."
And it's all my fault.
I wish I'd never heard of Atlantis.
That's weird.
What?
The lid.
It's not magnetic.
How can that be?
"Well, I don't know."
W-what are you doing?
"Trust me, professor, trust me."
It's platinum.
"Yeah, well, I get that a lot."
"Actually, can you help me with one more thing?"
I'm not a very good typist.
I always feel like I have ten thumbs.
Is there any way you could type up an e-mail for me?
Don't be upset with me.
Arianna...
"Arianna, what are you talking about?"
What are you doing here?
That e-mail I had your little girl type...
It went to a crime boss named tom harper.
William gerwin got his parole by agreeing to testify
In an organized crime case.
He sent away one of tom harper's top lieutenants.
Harper never knew who the snitch was.
"That is, until now."
"Oh, my god, you do know"
"What that man is gonna do to gerwin, don't you?"
Absolutely.
"And by the way, he's already done it."
Gerwin is already dead?
It happened about an hour ago.
That man took everything from me.
There's no way I could let him take
"Everything from my dad, too."
I want what he did to remain a secret.
"Well, I'm sure it will."
Now...
Maybe...
Maybe there's no reason for anyone to know now.
Good.
But there is one person who deserves to know the truth...
My sources downtown are telling me they know who ann is.
L.A.P.D. Just identified her prints.
"We have got to turn her in now,ron."
Who's the homicide a.D.A. On duty?
"William matthew byrne,jr."
Ouch.
Byrne's tough.
"If we turn ann in now, byrne will be the trial d.A."
When does his shift end?
6:00 a.M. Then it's j.D. Keller.
Maybe we should wait.
"Hey,i am not afraid of byrne."
I'd rather go up against keller.
"Keller loves the media so much, he'll tip his trial strategy"
Just to get his name in the paper.
We'll know what he's gonna do in court before he does it.
"After he hit me,i landed here in the corner by the bed."
"He was here between me and the door,"
"And the cart was right here, where i grabbed the knife."
How?
Show me.
I just swung and ran past him.
So you had to use deadly force because he blocked your retreat.
Excellent.
Who's doing the investigation?
"It's a wobbler-- L.A.P.D.,"
Beverly hills p.D.-- Joint jurisdiction.
So they'll be fighting over who gets to make the arrest.
I love it.
Turf battles between cops always help the defense.
"The l.A.P.D. Will really want this one bad,"
So arrange to turn her in to the beverly hills p.D.
"Enjoy your meal, everyone."
Enjoy your meal.
Calm down.
Just calm down.
Was I not clear that the terms of your sanctuary here included nonviolence?
I can guarantee you nothing like this will ever happen again.
"Well, be that as it may, you can no longer stay here with us."
Your presence is just too disruptive.
Truth is that our sanctuary was never gonna last very long here anyways.
Was it?
With you not standing up to Jeanine.
(SCOFFS)
You don't understand us at all.
TRIS:
"No, I do understand you."
I understand that you think you can stay out of this.
But you can't.
One day she's gonna show up and Jeanine is gonna take whatever power you think you have away from you.
FOUR:
"Tris, Tris... (INHALES DEEPLY)"
FOUR:
"Look, Johanna, we need a little more time."
I need to find out where the rest of the Dauntless are.
Then we can leave.
And then what?
Attack Erudite?
I will not be a party to violence.
FOUR:
And no one's asking you to.
We just need a few more days.
One.
One what?
- Huh?
You about ready to take the wheel up here?
- Learn the how-tos of driving?
- Huh?
"I mean, you had your learner's permit about seven years, bud."
I'll just do that later.
"Hey, come on."
Changing subjects.
Who wants some waffles and ice cream?
"Oh, I know I do."
"But I'll take my ice cream first, because real men eat dessert first."
Dessert first!
All:
Dessert first!
Dessert first!
Dessert first!
Did you quit work?
Why would I quit?
You're not going to work?
I don't work on Sundays.
"It's Monday, not Sunday."
Do you have two Sundays on your calendar?
"Yesterday was the last day of your break, Sunday!"
What's wrong with you?
Is it a side effect from your painkillers?
Stop taking them.
Stop taking them and go to the hospital.
Isn't it Sunday?
You were complaining about how your break was ending.
You were so fixated on that that you didn't even know the day had passed.
"It's way past seven, you're already late."
"If it was me, I'd fire any employee who was late on the first day after their break."
"Oh, shit"
# There goes the charabanc... #
"Has anyone ever told you, you have beautiful tits?"
"Yeah, loads of people."
And skin so pale you can see the veins.
"Well, my Auntie Kim got skin cancer off the sunbed so I don't use them."
"And spray-on looks shit, so..."
- What's your game?
- It's OK.
Um... he's my brother.
There's something really wrong with him.
- He really should have mentioned it.
- What?
"Um, he's really, er... passive aggressive."
"Basically, he's just a knob."
I don't care.
"It's only for an afternoon and I've got a regular fella, anyways."
- So...
- Classy.
"Still, plenty more fish in the sea, eh?"
Come on.
You all right?
What are you talking fish for?
Is there anything we can get you?
He needed to feed.
"So, you're saying we should have let him tear that girl's throat out?"
"No, I'm saying he can't survive like this forever."
"OK, but we can't turn him out onto the streets."
He isn't safe.
"Mitchell isn't safe with another vampire in the house, not while he's feeding."
"Annie's right, I'm just about holding it all together, and he brings"
"- chaos here, I'm sorry."
"Oh, my God, dude, I got out of there like I had a fucking map."
How about a little bit of consideration for a dying woman?
"Oh, I'm not dying."
I'm just here for some tests.
"Okay, pipe down."
"Wait, where's Pierce?"
"Wait, where's Amy?"
"No, no, no, no!"
"No, no."
- That's Amy.
- Shit!
"- Oh, my..."
"- Yeah, what a shame."
We should use this finger to wipe your tears.
Whoa.
"No, no, no, no."
"Dan, get out of my car."
Do you think I want to be in this fucking Minecraft piece of shit?
I am an emissary of the president and I demand that you get out of my car.
You colossal fucking fanny pack.
"You don't get it, do you?"
They only sent you 'cause they knew that you would fuck it up.
"You're so stupid, you don't even know that you're being used for your stupidity."
"That's bullshit, Dan."
I can tell from your eyes and because it's fucking bullshit.
Where's Richard?
"- This isn't fucking over, Egan."
"- Just get in and drive, bitch."
- Okay.
Shit.
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- It's just a glitch.
(SIGHING)
Gaston has escaped the Bastille.
And the King and Aramis have not returned from the Mausoleum.
This is not a coincidence.
ATHOS:
We ride for Saint-Denis.
(GRUNTS)
And I would apologise for the surroundings.
"But I imagine, as a soldier and a priest, you are well acquainted with death."
More than I'd have wished.
"Yes, I too am acquainted with death more than I'd have wished."
Death has a grip on me.
One I cannot break.
I am so sorry.
I don't want your sympathy.
That's not why you're here.
"But there is something I need from you, Aramis."
"Without it, I will not find peace."
"A truth I need to hear from your mouth, and don't lie."
You and my wife may think I'm a fool but I am not a fool.
I know.
Say it.
It will serve... no purpose.
You are a musketeer.
You only exist to serve my purpose.
I am ordering you!
Why dredge up the past?
Admit!
Admit you slept with the Queen!
I slept with the loneliest woman in Paris.
Don't you dare make excuses!
This woman suffered years of neglect and betrayal from your part.
"Can you give me a second, please?"
Can I have some space?
"All right, listen to me."
"You're not gonna outshoot him, so out-D him."
All right?
Play it like it's football.
"Put a body on him, steal the ball away, put it through the hoop."
Huh?
"What's he gonna do, call a foul?"
We're in jail.
I can do that.
No.
No.
That's game.
"Let's have it, man."
"All right, badge."
Here it is.
"Couple weeks ago, we're in rec watching some tube."
"This Samoan dude walks by, he tries to change the channel."
Dawkins almost throws down there.
"You should have seen him, his eyes were crazy."
- Because he changed the channel?
"No, bro, it wasn't that."
It was something on TV that made him go crazy.
What was he watching?
"Dana, your luxury vacation includes first class airfare, seven nights at the Kahiko Hotel."
"All-access VIP passes to the annual Festival of the Islands, which kicks off two weeks from now, and since you'll need a little spending money while shopping on beautiful Kalakaua Avenue,"
- we're throwing in $ 1 million.
- Aah!
Aah!
She's the reason Dawkins broke out of prison?
She won a million dollars and a trip to Hawaii.
- What are you gonna do?
"Well, I have a plan, i do."
But I need money.
I need it fast.
I was thinking about that guy who wanted the snowmobiles.
- Yeah.
- You think he's still interested?
"Yeah, I think so, but you'd have to find some way to deliver 'em."
Set it up.
Set... it... up.
"- [ Dick ] $100,000?"
- That's right.
"You wanna sell me a lotto ticket worth $6.4 million for $100,000?"
Correct.
I want out.
"However, this is a one-time-only offer, Dick."
"I want the money, I want it tonight at the station."
"If I hear any excuses, any bullshit like, ""I can only get part of it""... or ""I need more time,"" the deal is off."
- Be reasonable.
It'll take days -
- Deal's off.
"- I'll get it, I'll get it."
- Good decision.
"[ Russ ] Now, I believe that i have solved all of our problems."
[ Crystal ] What century is this guy in?
"Put a motor on it, Jake!"
A year and a half behind this freak.
"One, I found a buyer for the snowmobiles, a guy in Colorado."
"I'm renting a trailer, and i'm gonna deliver them myself."
- But why Colorado?
"- But, uh, uh!"
Number two: the lotto ticket.
- Good and you?
- Not so bad.
Can we talk?
- Okay.
"- ""Talk."""
In your truck.
Okay.
Now that was just right.
(EXHALES)
"So how did you make out, super chief?"
Did you find the missing Goldi-link?
You falling' in Goldi-love?
"It's better to Goldi-let this go, before I Goldi-lose my shit."
"Oh, take your drink, you Goldi-lush."
Tread Goldi-lightly.
"So, that's no toe-curlin' then?"
It's impolite to kiss and tell.
Nothin' wrong with a little stank on the hang down.
Nothin' wrong with a little takesin' out in the trades.
A little hizzin' in the skizzins.
"No, I know there's nothin' wrong with a little goin' to the bone yard, I know that."
Nothin' wrong with a little bacon makin'.
Nothin' wrong with a little shot twixt winds and waters.
A little building the blanket monster.
I know there's nothin' wrong with a little pituitary poke.
- I know that.
- Nothin' wrong with a little making' the beast with two backs.
Makin' feet for children's stocking's.
Testing the tube steak.
"Look, I know there's nothin' wrong with a little crawl up the skin slide."
- I know that.
"- Nothin' wrong with a little,"
Why do you want him?
We have the two new guys.
Those cream puffs are useless!
Forget about 'em.
"Enough of your ""peep peep."""
"Mr. Biberkopf, my tie's come undone."
You got that patented tie holder?
Come to the Alexanderplatz.
They don't allow business in here.
"Franz, let's go somewhere else."
Take it easy.
Buy the real thing here!
Why do rich men on the west side wear ties but workers don't?
"One for 20, three for 50!"
Step right up!
"Shall I loosen my tie and sing a little song, boys?"
"Peep, peep, peep"
The dickey bird sings
Do you know where the dickey bird sings
In its cage
Where
On the wall Don't ask such stupid questions
Perhaps the honorable Mr. Biberkopf will sing something too.
You bet I will!
What should I sing?
Wait a minute.
What can the band play?
Wait a minute.
"Do you know ""I Once Knew a Comrade""?"
I once knew a comrade
You couldn't find a better man
But now it's all over and I've paid my dues
"Sid, what can I tell you?"
You know how I...
"How I felt about Claire, huh?"
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
"We're ready, Mr. Fowler!"
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'll be right there."
Whoops!
We're hooked.
I'm terribly sorry to have this happen at such a tense moment.
"Mr. Fowler, we're ready!"
"I said, I'll be there."
"I'd better watch this, Lieutenant."
Do you mind?
SID:
"What's the story, huh?"
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
"We're running a little late, Sidney."
"Let's move it, huh?"
"Lieutenant, what about this robber?"
Do you have any leads?
"Well, sir..."
"The truth is, it seems to be a little bit more complicated than a robbery, sir."
Oh?
What the Lieutenant is saying is that he's come to the conclusion that Claire may have been murdered and the robbery may be a cover-up.
Murdered?
That's insane.
"Don't you think you should have come to me first with this, Lieutenant?"
"Well, I tried to, sir."
I've been looking for you ever since last night.
I was with my lawyer last night.
"We meet for chess once or twice a month, and last night turned out to be a marathon session."
Let's see what else you could have got.
"A sidecar - cognac, Cointreau lemon juice, sugar, syrup."
And you could also found Negroni.
Don't think I've ever heard of it.
"Gin, red vermouth, Campari, garnished with an orange peel?"
I bet you could do with one now?
LAUGHTER
"So, at the end of that, you had one point, that's taken you to seven."
The Lutrophiles are on 11.
In round three you're faced with a super-hive.
"You're looking for a number of answers that fit a certain category, but your challenge is to use every letter to find one, perfect solution."
"Team Lutrophiles, we're kicking off with you."
"Would you like the A hive, or the B hive?"
I think go we'll choose the A hive.
You're choosing the A hive.
You are looking for...
"You have two minutes, reveal the hive."
So...
You've got...
Cowdrey's maybe somewhere?
"Yep, yep, yep."
"So, who've we got?"
Gower.
"Hang on, you've got Brearley."
Gower...
That's clashing with Brearley.
Put the other Y for Cowdrey.
"Oh, OK."
Put the other Y.
There we are.
And then put Brearley round it.
Right.
"Well, all right."
"You told me to my face you weren't a cop, man."
I feel manipulated.
I thought we were gonna hang out.
"We are hanging out, Badger."
You like Badger or Brandon?
"I like people who don't, like, abuse the Constitution."
"Badger, listen."
"I'm trying to help you here, man."
"If you just tell me who your supplier is,"
I think this can end very well for you.
What are you doing talking to my client without me present?
You Sneaky Pete!
Which is which?
"What, did the Academy hire you right out of the womb?"
You guys get younger every...
What'd you say to Baby-Face?
Did you say anything stupid?
"By anything stupid, I mean anything at all."
Look at you.
"Mouth open, vocal chords a-twitter."
We'll talk about it later.
"Right now, you out."
Ten minutes ago!
Go on!
"There are laws, detective."
Have your kindergarten teacher read 'em to you?
Go grab a juice box.
Have a nap.
Go on.
All right.
Who do we have?
Now you will know when the lenders..
..will come and ask you forthe money!
You will realize when your houses will be auctioned!
You will realize when your mills will be locked up!
What are you waiting for?
Go!
Leave!
Get lost from here!
Leave before my watchman comes here..
..throws you out of my cabin!
Just leave from here!
"I say, get lost from here!"
"Forgive me, sir!"
Forgive me!
"congratulations, sir!"
Congrats!
Why are you so sad at this happy occasion?
Now you have already revenged your enemies!
You have got back yourSwarg!
But still you are..
"Airport, heaven cant be a heaven.."
..unless God dwells in there!
"You are right, Krishna."
We have looked for him everywhere.
But we couldnt find him!
I am afraid that he might have..
"No, Airport!"
It cant be!
As long as I am alive nothing can happen to him!
He is not meeting me because he is annoyed with me.
"But tomorrow, I will visit a temple where.."
..he had found me when I was an orphan!
- Haven't you heard about Selena Cross?
"- No, why?"
"She killed her stepfather, Lucas."
"Her trial starts in two days, for murder."
"Lucas was always a bad joe, but she seemed to be able to put up with him."
Who ever knows what anyone's able to put up with?
"Well, that's true."
Sure took me a long time to know about myself and understand Peyton Place.
- Cigarette?
- Thanks.
I'm gonna go back and try and work things out with my mother.
Maybe we'll both be happier.
"If not, well, at least I've made the effort, you know?"
I always wondered why you enlisted.
"In the paratroopers, I mean."
I guess I wanted to get knocked off or something.
But as soon as I got away from my mother I realized how wonderful life really was.
Then I fought like a tiger to stay alive.
I was running away from my problems.
You know what I mean.
"Yeah, I know."
"Something's bothering you, isn't it?"
Yeah.
Can I help?
"No, you can't."
- Okay.
- I'd rather not talk about it.
All right.
"Hey, have you had dinner?"
"Would you like dinner, with me?"
- Okay.
- Okay?
"You know, some people might find it peculiar that I, a Muslim, am buying so much fertilizer."
OK.
"Well, enjoy your fertilizer and being a Muslim."
I'll get your change.
Aren't you supposed to go to Amaar's mosque kick-off press conference?
"Yes, I am."
"It's a town meeting, and I am the mayor."
And yet you're not moving.
I will.
Just waiting for Charles to call.
I just want to hear his voice.
We've hardly talked at all this week.
Hey!
"Stop ignoring me, I'm actually opening up."
I'm sorry.
I'm just lost inside my head.
I don't think I'm a Muslim anymore.
Have you eaten any bacon yet?
"I've toyed with the idea, but I haven't followed through."
I just keep asking myself:
Why am I a Muslim?
"I mean, is it because of Rayyan, because if it's because of..."
"Oh, my God!"
"OK, you win."
I'll go to Amaar's press conference.
Just stop talking.
[ sigh ] [ cell phone ringing ]
Mayor Popowicz's phone.
Oh!
"Hello, Charles."
"Well, I must say that's very descriptive, but this is Sarah, and I'm not nearly that flexible."
I'll let Ann know you called.
Do we have to?
Why?
No reason.
Is that all you have to say on the matter?
What is this need to have a reason for everything?
"Oh, of course, I forget, you're a pathologist."
You tend to be very literal about things like reasons.
"When you killed them, when you looked into their eyes, what were you hoping to see?"
Nothing.
Nothing?
Killers meet the same end as saints.
"There is no heaven, no hell no final judgment."
You hope'!
Aren't you gonna ask me if I had a troubled childhood?
try and unravel the meaning of it all?
I've got more meaningful things to do with my life.
Tom?
I'm still here.
I've been thinking.
"Not about work, I hope."
About you.
Really?
I've been thinking about you and your father.
You need to forgive him.
If you don't want to end up like me.
What do you mean?
Bitter.
Bitter about what?
Not marrying.
Not having children.
Buying my life in my work.
You have a father.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
(TASER ZAPPING) (SOLDIER GRUNTING)
(BODY FALLS DOWN)
(MACHINE BEEPING)
It's not my usual fantasy.
"Usually, you're wearing latex and a strap-on."
"Well, I see the bullet hasn't improved your sense of humor, then."
And Stonebridge?
You found his corpse yet or you're still looking?
We don't know that he's dead yet.
(GRUNTING) He's been looking for that bullet ever since Kate died.
"And, you knew that."
You fucking used it.
You knew he'd go the whole nine to rescue some damsel in distress.
"Too bad your perfect plan fucked up, huh?"
"I liked him too, Scott."
Yeah.
"But, unfortunately, I can only rescue you at the moment."
(GRUNTING) Lucky me... (WHISPERS) Bitch.
(GRUNTING)
(WATER DRIPPING)
Nothing.
I think we're good.
They're just chasing blind.
For now.
But we're still gonna have to keep moving.
(GRUNTING)
You can still have that morphine shot if you want it.
That's all right.
"It's okay, I won't think you're any less macho."
Someone else might need it more later.
Hmm.
"Molly, you up yet?"
Aw!
Out!
"Oh, look who's coming to the kitchen in his jammie pants."
Morning.
"Cop a squat, I'll get you a cup of coffee."
Thank you.
"Listen, uh, Mrs. Flynn,"
I really appreciate you letting me move in here.
"Oh, please, call me Joyce, and it really wasn't my decision."
Cream and sugar?
"Black, please."
You'll love it with cream and sugar.
That's the way Molly's dad drank it.
"I don't really process dairy well, but okay."
"And listen, if there's anything you ever need done, just let me know."
I want to earn my keep.
"We're talking chores, right, not some sort of plus- sized gigolo action?"
No.
"I'm pulling your leg, hoss."
Oh.
"If you're serious about helping out, a couple of those kitchen cabinets could use new hinges."
I'll take care of that today.
We could also use a new screen for the back door.
Victoria walks through at least one a year.
Consider it done.
And a new exhaust hose for the dryer.
Easy to do.
"Oh, and the pulsating shower wand upstairs has seen better days."
Three women in the house...
don't ask.
Wasn't planning on it.
What she put in a diary you take above my word?
"Everything that happened that day, Roberts."
Now!
-l told you.
-The super says you were there twice.
The super says.
The snitch says in her book.
"What about what Roberts says, huh?"
All right.
"I was there before she died, okay?"
Okay?
And I brought her something.
I was desperate to break it off with this girl.
"What happened, Roberts?"
Now!
I bought her a bag of quinine.
"I brought her a beat bag, looks and tastes like dope."
She's not going to know it's not dope until after I leave.
I needed to talk to her. I needed to tell her how things were gonna be.
She wasn't gonna listen to me unless I did... .
Unless I gave her something.
"So I gave her the stuff, told her we were done..."
"... shefreaksout,thisandthat."
I'm gonna do myself in.
"Believe me, for her that was like going to the crapper."
That's how many times she threatened that.
And that's it.
"I broke it off with her, and I left."
"Why did you go back, Mike?"
Because I was worried about her.
Because exactly what I was afraid of actually happened.
I get there...
"Well, we couldn't stand by and see you suffer for speaking your mind."
Mrs Cameron's loss is very much our gain.
"You're very welcome here, Claire."
I can't thank you enough.
- You just have.
"Well, here's to ""speaking your mind""."

"You're thinking about Joyce, aren't you?"
I can practically hear the pistons of frustration pounding in your head.
I'm not wasting any more mental energy on that woman.
But I am thinking about how we might resurrect the Institute.
Might not mothballing be for the best for the time being?
Given that everyone's looking inwards now.
That is not the same girl Chuck came home with last night.
"Has he, uh, come to talk to Lily yet?"
Do you want me to talk to him?
"No, I already tried, but thank you."
I'm gonna come to your lacrosse game after brunch.
Judge away.
Shame turns me on.
"Hey, man, she's going to Lily's for brunch."
Maybe a stack of waffles will help your hangover?
I find the cause is the best cure.
I gotta go.
"So I will see you later at the library,"
And I'm sorry about before
With the Tisch catalog.
It's fine.
"Dan, I don't know how to do this."
We've been tiptoeing around each other for days.
"Look, we're-we're two artists in a relationship,"
"And sometimes we're gonna be competing for the same things,"
"So, all right, we're- we're-we're smart people."
Let's come up with...
"Some rules,"
A list of topics that are off-limits.
Isn't that what got us in trouble with Tisch?
"No, no."
"This will be different,"
Because we'll know...
What we don't know.
"Hey, listen to me."
I'm quoting Donald Rumsfeld.
"Okay, until the sting of Tisch has worn off,"
I
- Isn't that true?
"- Yes, it's-- it's correct, but I-"
- I'm deeply...ashamed.
"So you get angry, and you take revenge."
That's what you do.
"You did it to a woman that you loved, and now you're doing it to the company that fired you."
- That's not a question.
- No.
Here's the question.
"Yes or no, the model on the blueprints that you were just talking about, did any of them have the Borns Tech name or any identifying markings on them?"
"Not that I know of, no."
They could have been made by anybody.
"I mean, for all we know, they could be Ryan Larson's design."
"I mean, yes, but that-- that wouldn't be feasible."
Yes.
I suppose so.
Nothing further.
[street noises]
[footsteps]
Hi.
I went by your office.
"I saw your stuff was still there, so I figured you might have come up here."
Clever of me.
Here.
It's liberating to do the wrong thing sometimes.
Most of the time.
What generation of feminism are we up to now?
Fifth wave?
Or sixth?
I don't-
- I've lost count.
I do know that it is still... really hard.
And thought why don't I come to your home... drink water in your house and... break their bones here.
Sir you know...
Don't interfere!
What do I care?
- All I want is to...
- Get water out.
Welcome Tauji.
I've invited him here specially... to tell him about your deeds.
And show him too.
Your man's taken our contract... and he's been beating up our men... instead of doing our job.
Enough!
My rule is we can sacrifice our kin... but never fail from completing a contract.
Sometimes... we make a mistake.
In life we often make small mistakes... as well as big ones.
They are 3D villains.
3 generous villains.
They gave me one chance to catch that scoundrel.
They'll give me a second chance.
Third... fourth... fifth...
Stop it.
Are you going to keep running after him all your life?
Mr. Pradhan.
Contract cancel.
What did you say?
What did you say?
We cancel the contract we gave you.
Cancel!
Cancel!
Cancel!
Uncle you heard.
They cancelled the contract.
When the contract's canceled... there's no question of betraying.
- where are you headed?
- to what i promised the last ghost i would do.
- [scoffs] clean up your mama's shop?
"no, you ain't."
- [scoffs] [snaps fingers]
- this ain't right.
this ain't the salon.
- this is like -  scrapbooking place.
- what the heck?
"- it looks god-awful, don't it?"
"[laughs] [coughs, laughs]"
"- hey, i know that laugh."
i know that laugh!
mama.
- [clicks tongue]
- you look terrible.
- well...
- what's up with the creepy black robe?
"- robe's part of the tradition for, uh, ghosts of christmas future."
"anyway, after you married wayne, you sold the place to bob and marge."
you never did get no job.
"- [scoffs] well, i actually think it looks kind of nice."
"- oh, you like the way this looks?"
it looks like a magazine or something.
it's got no soul.
"i mean, honey, look what you let happen to the salon that i built with my own hands."
- it's quaint!
- yeah.
then marge went even hog-wild after she got it all in the divorce.
- wait -- bob and marge got a divorce?
- yeah.
- see?
"Essentially, it's like feeding the beast-- this big, ugly, greedy beast that demands to be fed over and over and over again."
Is this your first meeting?
Hi.
"Yeah, actually, it is."
My name's Nick.
I'm Monica.
Hi.
Your words were an inspiration.
Thanks.
"Yeah, she's great, isn't she?"
This is Hillary.
"Hillary, this is Nick."
"Hillary, it's a pleasure."
Hi.
"Listen, if this is your first time, you shouldn't feel pressured to join this group."
There's others in the city you might want to check out.
Hillary's right.
It's really important that you trust the people you're going to be looking to to help you...
And who'd you rather look to for help than Monica?
"You come here to get off drugs, and you meet Monica."
That's a pretty good deal.
I'd marry her tomorrow if she'd give me the word.
"Henry, settle down."
You're going to scare Nick off.
"Well, that's the idea."
Less competition.
"We'll, um, talk later, right?"
Yeah.
I'm his sponsor.
"Look, why don't I take you over to Angie?"
She's got books and pamphlets.
"Nick, it's going to be rough, but we're all here for you, and if you need any help, just call me, okay?"
Little appreciation of my cooking!
I want us to work together to remove the obstacles to Griff being rehired.
"Allen, I'm the obstacle."
- Last word?
- Last word.
You like the kielbasa?
- New chief came to see me.
- Gillray.
"He's planning on eliminating supervisory and middle management positions, so..."
I'm a supervisor.
"Allen, you gotta do your best to protect me, I..."
This is not the Allen Conner I know.
- He's my son.
- Mm-hmm.
You're not even a little ashamed of yourself maybe?
A little bit?
"He's in trouble, Frank, I know it and you know it, and I just, I..."
I just gotta keep him close.
"If I can, if we can do that, I can..."
I have a chance to help him.
"Otherwise, I don't know where he is, or"
- how to find him or he could be dead in...
"- OK, OK."
- OK?
What does that mean?
- OK.
Griff gets his job back and I keep mine.
"I won't forget this, Frank."
"Yeah, well, I'm going to try."
"I just, when I started these classes I had this feeling that it was all part of my destiny, but I didn't know how,"
- but now I do.
"- It's so great that you're back in school, Tash."
"Archaeology is our religion, yet we have both fallen from the purer faith."
Our methods have not differed as much as you pretend.
I am a shadowy reflection of you.
"It would take only a nudge to make you like me, to push you out of the light."
Now you're getting nasty.
You know it's true.
How nice.
Look at this.
It's worthless.
Ten dollars from a vendor in the street.
"But I take it,"
"I bury it in the sand for a thousand years, it becomes priceless..."
like the Ark.
Men will kill for it.
Men like you and me.
"What about your boss, der Fuehrer?"
I thought he was waiting to take possession.
All in good time.
When I am finished with it.
"Jones, do you realize what the Ark is?"
It's a transmitter.
It's a radio for speaking to God.
And it's within my reach.
You want to talk to God?
Let's go see Him together.
I've got nothing better to do.
"Uncle Indy, come back home now!"
Uncle Indy!
"Next time, Indiana Jones, it'll take more than children to save you."
Uncle Indy!
I thought I would find you there.
"Better than the United States Marines, eh?"
I think it's just a question of joining them together...
legato.
Simplicity is the hardest thing.
It's the final thing.
"Well, er..."
"- Next week, then?"
- Yes.
"Good day, Your Highness."
"Monsieur, Baroness Dudevant is here."
Baroness Dudevant?
I don't think I know her.
"Well, send her in."
This is the first time I've found a use for my title.
You are incredible!
"I only need a minute of your time, then I'll go."
Very well.
I'll give you exactly one minute.
"I am leaving Pa... (PLAYS ""MINUTE WALTZ"")"
I am leaving Paris.
You can't have failed to notice I've been pursuing you.
I'm in love with you.
I don't know you at all...
(STOPS PLAYING)
"I don't know you at all, but I know this:"
you are great.
You have made a single instrument speak the language of God.
"And I wanted to learn it from your lips, you see."
"Anyway, you..."
"You don't want me and... it's become complicated, like everything between two people."
"It seems to me a pity, because it could have been so simple."
I'm begging you to give this up.
"I know that you're in need, with your children and your mother's funeral."
You scared me.
Hey!
You scared me.
"Hey, hey."
Why are you acting like this?
You came recently.
Yes.
"You were born in 1980, year of the tiger, right?"
"Your parents didn't register your birth early or late, right?"
Do you look at any half good-looking man with that kind of nauseating gaze...?
Are you a crazed fan of pretty faced men?
Fine.
"Watch, watch."
Watch as much as you want.
I'm going to sleep.
I'll hear the good news first.
The good news is...
Synced  ripped by bozxphd Subtitles by The Blue Sea @ Viki
Ah dah~
Ah dah~
"Say, ""hello"""
That's how we greet.
We've already forgotten that place a long time ago.
We can't remember that distant time long ago when life first sprouted in the sea to when we stepped onto the land to live. (THE LEGEND OF THE BLUE SEA)
What is the sea to all of you?
How many times a day do you think of the sea?
What are you doing?
Did you stay up all night like that?
How old are you that you've fallen for a celebrity?
Are you a crazy fan girl?
Stop watching and give it here.
Hello?
Somebody get the little dudes a snack and no hockey till I get home from work.
Your lover boy is here.
You better put that down before you hurt somebody.
You better come and take it from me.
Okay.
How was that?
"Little high, a little wide."
"Like you could do better, Zamboni-boy."
"Not in that butt-ugly uniform, I couldn't."
Did you get Hello Kitty to sponsor you?
- L'll just get Dad to fire you.
"- No way, your dad loves me."
"Besides, you like to stare at my butt when I'm working."
- That's disgusting.
- Is not.
I wash it every day.
Are you okay?
Okay.
Mess.
This lot is 40 acres.
"The owners were old time hockey players, the meanest goons to ever tie on skates."
Let's see how scary they really are.
"Welcome to Zenovation, one-stop shop for mind, body and soul."
"How may we help you, our sisters?"
"Love the robes, fellows."
I'm Bernie Frazier with Frazier Realty.
I'm here to talk to you about your land.
May I come in?
- Not interested.
- Bad karma.
Nice wheels.
"Okay, it seems the gooneys have gone loony."
That is nothing.
"I broke a chair, and I had a few words with him, that is all."
Don't you feel that you could be in trouble over Somers?
The way you talked about him over the phone to me--
Of course not.
That is not the trouble that worries me.
But you admit you are worried.
Don't make your lawyer's talk with me!
"Axel, have you been able to locate Edie Morrow?"
Who told you about her?
Lisa Pedersen.
Lisa is a snoop!
Listen to me.
This is not how Axel talks about people.
And yelling at his friends.
"That's all right, Axel."
"If you'll just explain the background of all this, perhaps we could help you find Miss Morrow."
If that's the thing that concerns you.
Ja.
"Ja, it is."
"And just one thing you must promise me, Mr. Mason."
"If you do find where Edie is, first tell me, not them."
Mr. Mason?
"Perry, this is Mr. Hadley."
"Sam Hadley, the furniture man."
"Oh, yes."
You were one of the bidders on the Norstaad Shop and trademark.
"- What can I do for you, Mr. Hadley?"
- Plenty.
"I was just talking to Axel on the phone, and he tells me that you're going to resolve this mess that he's got into."
"Are you assuming that now Mr. Somers is dead,"
Axel will sell his trademark to you?
Not a dime.
"Honest, Sarge, they all owe me."
"Listen, right next to Zimmerman's name, put ""KEOZ."""
"I'll know what it means-- ""Keep Eye On Zimmerman."""
"All right, dismissed."
"Hey, Sarge, I got a couple letters for you."
"Oh, those finance companies must have radar."
What's this?
"Oh, this is a joker."
"This is addressed to the house I used to live in way before the war, when I was still a civilian."
"Hey, Sarge, maybe you've been drafted, huh?"
"It's a little late for that, don't you think?"
"Oh, no."
Ten years.
"What is it, Ernie?"
It's just not possible.
Ten years.
"Hey, Ernie, come on back to us Earth people."
The squad I led in WWII-- way before I even met you guys-- they're having a reunion.
A reunion?
"Yeah, I forgot all about it."
"You see, we were pinned down on a beach in the Marianas, and we swore if we ever got out of it alive, we were going to meet ten years from that day for the biggest, fanciest banquet at the Waldorf-Astoria."
The Waldorf-Astoria?
"Man, what a crazy barrack."
(laughter)
"Oh, what a bunch of deadbeats they were."
"Wait a second, wait, hold this."
I got a picture of 'em in here someplace.
Get a load of that.
That's me holding the flag.
BARBELLA:
Let's see.
It's never felt like this before.
They're coming at last.
The unidentified object has crashed at Narita Airport.
It is still emitting light.
82% of the enemy's makeup cannot be analyzed.
What in the world is this adversary?
This is our true enemy.
Our true enemy...?
I'll explain later.
Can Dangaioh be deployed at once?
Yes.
"In another 30 seconds, it will be loaded onto the Saber Sonic."
It will be ready to go in 140 seconds.
I'll be there in 50 seconds.
Clear Route 7 for my arrival.
What's happening?
I don't know.
I only know that the temperature is rising rapidly.
Vice-Commander...
"We have no data, this time...?"
N-no...
"We know so little of its makeup, power source, armaments that we can't draw any projections."
And so... um...
"I'm sorry, please switch off the monitor."
I had no time to change.
"Listen to me, everyone..."
This battle will be like nothing before.
Anything can happen.
But...
Come on!
That's enough talk!
"I'm itching for a good fight, today!"
There's Tommy with that bitch Josephine.
She had the same clothes on last weekend.
And she lives in Virum.
I just saw Jonas Engberg and Nik Kragh.
MONEY
"We set the trend for what's ""in""."
If me and my sister are seen in things we bought in New York   everyone wants the same.
You can buy your way out of most illnesses.
You can always go away somewhere for a cure.
I spend my money on on sex and gadgets and drugs and booze.
My friends rate some of my friends rate money higher than happiness.
But I hope -
- I'II be happy.
Then money won't matter.
I use my credit card as a comfort blanket.
If I'm feeling low I feel I deserve that top or that bag.
I haven't found a door I can't open with my money.
Crying in a limo with shaded windows is always more fun   than smiling at the wheel of a Skoda.
- I don't get it.
- Get what?
Anja and Patricia.
"The biggest cock-teasers   with Tommy and Jonas, the biggest shaggers in town."
"- Yes, it's weird."
- I'm getting new rims.
20 inch.
Straight from L.A.
- Cool.
"- I want 22"" Chrome."
- As my graduation present.
"- You can't have 22""if I've got 20""."
- Another line?
- You know I can't take it.
That was really funny how that guy smacked you.
Give him his rights.
Now that we're spending all this quality time together... let me tell you about your rights.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court oflaw.
"If you do not have an attorney, one will be assigned to you."
Do you understand all the rights I have read to you right now?
- Yes.
- Good boy.
Now shut up.!
- How's it look?
How's it look?
- It's beautiful.
Know what happens to pretty boys like you when they go to prison after the lights go out?
"""Oh, girlfriend.!"
"Oh, girlfriend.!"""
Shots fired.!
- Uncuff him now!
- What?
What the hell?
What in God's name?
"Have you lost your mind, young lady?"
I said uncuff Jack Hammond now!
"Come on, Miss Voss."
Put the gun down.
You don't know what you're doing.
This guy's brainwashed you.
Now come on.
"- Ned, get a shot of this!"
"- Natalie, stop embarrassing me."
"Do it, or I'll blow his brains out all over live TV."
"Miss Voss, don't do it."
In ways that I often thought I had imagined.
"I used to love the smell of her perfume,"
The-the tenor of her voice...
"Even now,"
When she lied to me.
She doesn't want us getting married.
She will stop it.
We have to elope.
Today.
Now.
Bash:
"There's a church just east of the old village, by the quarry."
I wish that I could come with you.
Let me get it
All arranged.
"It might take a few hours,"
"And if we're both missing, people will notice."
"If I'm not back by midday, we have our priest."
Get on a horse and meet me at the church before sunset.
"Don't plan on sleeping this night, wife."
Marie:
At least you're moving about
Freely now.
"Guarded, but with the mobility"
Required to plan my death.
How was the dungeon?
Were there fleas?
"Were you paraded through the town, mocked?"
Hmm.
I was in the tower.
"I realize you're not happy with the turn events have taken,"
But must you paint a bleaker picture of my fall?
Ha-ha!
Boom!
You suck!
"Yeah, this is better than a cruise."
"I know you're disappointed, but we should be here in case Cleveland needs us."
Even though our bags are already packed and our non-refundable tickets are right there.
And that taxi's waiting outside.
(honking) 'Ey!
You vashlooks order a cab?
"Well, we could just take a ride in the cab with our bags, see where it goes."
We at least owe it to our bags to put them in the cab.
"Screw it, let's go."
"I guess everything I do is for him, just to hear him say, ""I'm proud of you."""
Your father?
"No, Bradley Cooper."
"Well, we've made some progress."
You guys are out of your minds.
I'm going to take a shower.
Anybody want to take a shower?
All right.
I do.
This is ridiculous.
I don't belong here.
(ship's horn blares)
I belong on that cruise!
We're getting out of here.
And here's how...
CLEVELAND:
The orderlies' shift change is at 12:32 exactly.
"Tim, that's when you'll hack into the mainframe, disabling the security cameras."
(cracks knuckles)
(roars)
"A buddy, someone who cares."
Joey?
You ever have... your best friend...
stab you in the back?
Not since the army became my best friend.
You ever... suddenly feel that you're...
lost... that there's no place left for you to go?
I used to.
That was before the army became my home.
- Oh.
Really?
- Sure.
Think about it.
"The army feeds you, clothes you... gives you a place to sleep."
Every guy in khaki is family.
"Oh, that's... beautiful, Joey."
- The army is beautiful.
- To the army.
Max... you've got character.
- I wouldn't make this offer to just anybody.
- What kind of an offer?
What you need is an anchor... something that won't run out on you.
You know what I'm talking about?
The army.
[Chuckling] Hey.
"You're way ahead of me, Max."
Did you ever think about reenlisting?
Where do I sign?
"Okay, I got somethin' to tell ya... and I don't wanna hear so much as a titter, a snicker..."
- or a guffaw from anyone.
"- You hear that, Charles?"
The subject of this meeting is... the army.
Find anything?
I've been over the entire school twice.
No sulphur.
"No sulphur, no demon."
"No demon, no case."
I don't know.
Maybe I was wrong.
"Well, it happens to the best of us."
"I say we hit the road, huh?"
But after lunch.
It's sloppy-jo day.
"Good hustle, Colby!"
Walk it off!
"Hey, I need to copy of your algebra homework again."
Hey!
Why?
"'Cause you're a stupid, brain-dead dick?"
"I'm gonna shove my fist down your throat, you little freak."
- That fist?
- Yeah.
What happened?
How's the nonviolence assembly going?
"Apparently, shoving a kid's arm into a cuisine art is not a healthy display of anger."
"So, the kid had ectoplasm leaking out his ear?"
Which only comes from a seriously pissed-off spirit.
It's got to be ghost possession.
"Yeah, but that's pretty rare."
"Yeah, but it happens."
"I mean, they get angry enough, they can take control of a person's body."
"All right, so, what, we got a ghost in the building?"
"Yeah, but where?"
"I mean, there's no EMF."
- Hey.
- What's up?
"Hey, have you looked at that Cat Lady sketch?"
It's still seven minutes long.
"Yikes, okay."
"Oh, and Standards has a problem with that Michael Jackson bit."
But why?
Apparently you can't say he's got a vagina.
"Oh, it's--fine, I'll just take the whole thing out."
"Hey, you gotta tell that NBC page to take it down a notch."
"Oh, you mean Ken?"
"Yeah, he just embarrassed me in front of a whole tour group."
I'll talk to him.
What is this?
"Ah, well, you know how I hate it when people cheat or break rules?"
"Yes, I do."
"Well, I just spent 150 bucks on wieners."
Atta boy.
Chumley.
The beverage situation around here is reprehensible.
"Oh, good morning, sunshine."
Surely our massive conglomerate parent company could spring for a samovar of coffee.
"Yeah, or like a big coffee dispenser."
That's what a samovar is.
"Are there other black nerds, or is it just you and Urkel?"
"Uh, Cerie, do you wanna get some coffee?"
"No, thank you."
No?
"Hey, Josh."
I need to change your Michael Jackson thing.
Didn't you tell me you had a Jay Leno impression?
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
- Explains no pulse.
"Okay, let's get a CBC, chem seven, dip a urine, chest and pelvis x-rays."
"Chen, give me your hands."
- What are you doing?
- Hold tight.
Ken!
Have you ever been to Hawaii before?
"- Well, pretend that you' re there now."
"- Pratt, wait!"
I can't believe you!
I feel better.
I feel totally better!
I feel totally sick.
Why would you reduce an ankle with no pain meds?
No pulse is no blood is dead tissue.
"In other words, I just saved your foot."
Thank you.
You' re wonderful.
- Subclavian's in.
Is that the film?
- Five hundred cc's are out the chest tube.
- He's holding his pressure.
- No pneumothorax.
Looks like a widened mediastinum and loss of the AP window.
Hard to tell.
The pulmonary contusion is impressive.
One of us should go with him to CT.
Not unless you' re ready to crack the chest.
"Flail chest, pulmonary contusions, and labile hypotension."
Could also be from a splenic fracture.
"Carter, I'd like an aortagram."
"Better yet, a TEE."
"I know who you are, so it's okay."
Who do you want to interview?
"I'd like to interview you, actually."
- Is it okay with you?
"- Yeah, sure."
"Well, okay, then."
But I'm answering only the ones I can.
Nothing too personal.
- I appreciate this.
"- No, it's my pleasure."
- Sounds fun.
- Thank you.
Do you trust people easily?
I'm a little over thirty now.
I changed when I passed thirty.
I used to trust people easily.
"Back then, I had to define everything that I do."
"But after thirty, I loosened up."
"If I can't define things right away,"
"I just think some day I will, and take it easy."
"Wow, we're really different."
"I've been uptight since second grade, and haven't rested ever since."
Do you like dogs?
- Who doesn't?
- I'm afraid of them.
What do you believe in?
Have anything you have absolute faith in?
"- Yes, myself."
- You believe in yourself?
I think only about myself.
"I'm not perfect, but it's still me."
It's up to me to improve myself.
- I gotta get a new suit...
- Mine's covered in blood.
- Really?
Wow.
Ok.
- Yeah.
Great.
Thank you for coming.
It's been crazy.
Um.
"My credits cards were damaged in the accident, do you think you could help me pay the motel and I'll pay you back?"
"David, they weren't actually damaged."
You're broke.
You told me that last night.
"I just wish that you would, you know, tell me the truth when you were sober."
"Ok, the important thing to remember is this."
"In that nightmare yesterday, you were the only person I called."
"I'm looking for a man, answers to the name of Dashiell."
"Middle-aged, tall, pale, sickly, ambiguous sexuality, seriously anxious, probably consuming enormous amounts of alcohol while he's trying to comfort another man who's likely crying."
"Oh, and they're both covered with blood."
Have you seen him?
- Is this ok here?
- Yeah.
You're gonna go park?
Yeah.
Ow.
I think he was wearing a ring.
"I can still see it, just here."
- You look good.
- Thanks.
- It's gonna go well.
"- Yeah, I think it will."
But she forgot us.
The money we had borrowed for the wedding... led us... into endless troubles.
"To help my dad,"
I started working.
Even after 2 years
We couldn't clear even a chunk of the loan.
Dealing with the money-lenders has become a struggle of our daily life.
But...
Today...
Today?
Some thugs came home... and insulted us very badly.
They said...
"If you can't repay the loan,"
Ask your daughter to...
"Unable to hear such things, my dad..."
In a haste...
He promised to clear the loan... in 2 days.
I surely know that it's not possible.
Either...
We leave the city.
Or...
My family should...
"Don't be foolish, Deepa."
Even the man with a million rupees on loan is sitting happily.
"Please, Varun!"
You could have asked me.
No.
I just felt like sharing it with you.
"So, I did."
I have some savings.
I don't have immediate expenses lined up.
I will lend it to you.
-The power of Christ compels you.
He brought you low by his blood-stained cross!
"Do not despise my command, because you know me to be a sinner."
It is God himself who commands you.
The majestic Christ who commands you.
"God, the Father, commands you."
"God, the Son, commands you."
"God, the Holy Spirit, commands you."
The mystery of the cross commands you.
The blood of the martyrs commands you.
"Give way to Christ, you prince of murderers."
You're guilty before almighty God.
Guilty before his son.
Guilty before the whole human race.
"It is the Lord who expels you he who is coming to judge both the living and the dead and the world, by fire."
Are you tired?
Let's rest before we start again.
Why this girl?
It doesn't make sense.
I think the point is to make us despair.
To see ourselves as animal and ugly.
To reject the possibility that God could love us.
"Will you excuse me, Damien?"
Why?
Why?
No.
No.
"Dimmy, why you do this to me?"
"Please, Dimmy."
I'm afraid.
You're not my mother.
"Dimmy, please!"
"- Oh, yeah, those are ""plow me"" heels."
Nice.
- Mm-hmm.
The knee bruise is encouraging.
Working our way up to those 20-year-old tatas.
Oh.
"Gravity's cruel grasp hasn't found you yet, my sweet perky miracles."
Now let's get a gander at Dirty Girl's face.
- Mmm.
- Hey.
"Her face says, ""Ready to bone."" Am I right?"
"I say again, am I right?"
That's my half sister.
Then you probably shouldn't scroll to the next picture.
No!
"- That's my sister, Ted."
"- Well, look, I didn't know!"
"None of us even knew you had a sister until two years ago, including you."
Thi-This is just some crazy coincidence.
"There are four million women in the city of New York, Ted... and you sleep with my sister?"
Why would the universe do that to me?
I don't know.
It's not like you've ever treated women in such a way... that would invite some sort of karmic retribution.
You banged my sister!
"- My sweet, little, innocent..."
- Pierced.
Really?
Where?
Don't answer that!
Now I know why I felt everything you did to her last night.
It wasn't a bronnection.
It was a sisnnection.
-Have you told the colonel;
"-No, I can't face him."
"I've gone that one time over, bringing him bad news."
Are you coming;
No.
"Then I'm finished, Brock, as far as you're concerned."
Too much for me.
One last word.
"I advise you to get in town, fast."
"Sarah Beth, tell your father I couldn't wait."
You can get out of this yourself or the way you got out of jail.
"What did Mr. McCurtin mean, the way you got out;"
"-He got you out, didn't he;"
-No.
-Who did;
-Chamberlain.
I guess he figures the young and foolish should have another chance.
"All right, Brock, you don't have to cover up with me."
I've known for a long time.
-When;
-For sure when I was 15.
-How;
-A lot of things put together.
"And before I went back to school the last time I knew you knew it, and I knew Papa did."
I could kill Chamberlain.
That's what the trouble was about.
"This fellow I was gambling with, he said a few things."
That's why I couldn't tell the colonel.
I couldn't let him know that I know.
"Oh, Brock."
"We've been around a lot together, the colonel and me and he never let anybody even think anything once, at least not out loud."
"Oh, don't I know."
"- Well, I guess I'll just sit with you then?"
- No.
"I mean, no, don't-- don't you--"
"No, that got pushed an hour, so that I can watch your web debut."
That's--That's... great.
"That--that--well, that worked out well."
So I'll follow you.
- Great.
That's...
"- Yeah, come this way."
"- Good luck, honey."
"- Okay, thanks, babe."
Thank you.
"- Oh, I--just-- - oh, don't worry about it."
I'm sure they'll figure it out.
Have fun.
The Cylons are jamming the wireless.
Every frequency.
"Okay, we need to establish our communications."
Work out a plan to defend this temple while Tyrol searches.
Defend it with what ?
"A dozen marines, maybe five more military ?"
We're gonna have to draft the civilians.
Can I make a suggestion that you won't like ?
Do you make any other kind ?
Use Sam to command the civilians.
You're not serious.
- Lee.
"- Hey, Sam."
Hi.
I heard you were coming down.
I guess it takes an emergency to get us in the same room these days.
"After he died, I came back here and lied."
And I've been lying ever since.
You want the truth.
"And when you get it, you're just like everybody else."
-They want anything but the truth!
-Connie!
Connie!
I told you once that the offer was always open.
I told you that I'm committing myself to you all the way... that I plan to worry about you and take care of you.
I meant that.
"Oh, Michael!"
-How's that?
-Fine!
I'll get it.
-Merry Christmas!
-Aren't you going to invite me in?
Not very friendly after practically breaking my back getting here.
"Hi, Joey!"
"Say, there's a blizzard blowing out, a big one!"
You got a drink?
I'm froze.
You're nowhere near froze with all you've got in you already.
I see the Navy hasn't managed to cure you of drinking.
Cure me?
"Honey, the Navy started me in tricks you never heard of."
Say!
"You sure made a lot of changes around here, ain't you?"
You bet we have.
"And, for a start, you can pick up your things and go."
Ain't nobody going to tell me what I can't do in my own house.
-This isn't your house anymore!
-I don't care what you did.
"Hey, you understand that?"
"Hey, Hayden?"
Oh.
Oh!
It's...
"It's really, really nice to you."
So this is a great restaurant.
It's got lots of health conscious options.
Great.
Cause you know uh...
I take care of myself.
As you can see.
I...
I did notice your pecs just now.
Oh.
Hey!
Are you flexing?
Gwyneth Paltrow eats here.
Really.
"We need options for something low carb low fat, low sodium, high protein."
"Which is better, the bacon cheeseburger or the other?"
Is it wild caught or farm raised?
Do you have chicken fingers?
"Organic, vegan, non soy, gluten free..."
Do you recommend the mac and cheese?
Can you steam that instead of grilling I don't want any crudamites in my food.
I'll have the crab cakes with butter sauce.
Extra butter.
Are these Swedish meatballs kosher?
"You're right, but people really are vain here."
"I mean, I'm not."
I'm self aware which is like radically different.
"Jack, he's here."

Mr. Wilson?
We know who you are.
You're hurt.

Are you crazy?
You do this every week?
"Agent Garrett, yeti or no, he is a monster responsible for many deaths."
This man is suffering from a neurological trauma.
Charging in and killing him is not justice.
We need to try to apprehend him.

If they are threatened.
Those are my agents up there.
They have this situation under control.
Tell your men.

This is bad.
The yeti myth is part of their identity.
Any move he makes will be seen as aggression.

A relative of the Emperor.
He wants to replace me.
I lost the Emperor's favor... because he badmouthed me.
I didn't think I'd meet you here.
Mr. Hwang.
"This is my brother, Prince Daeso."
"(Hwangjagyung, Han Emperor's relative)"
I've heard a lot about you.
The Emperor heard about the alliance and was very impressed.
Long time no see.
Hope you had a nice trip.
What brings you here?
Your request for more provisions has upset the Emperor very much.
He was so upset...
I volunteered to come and offer some help.
I'm here to help you out.
Tell me whenever you need something.
Thanks for the offer but I won't need your help.
I'll organize a small feast for you.
I hope you enjoy your stay.
Very well.
"I'll sail south as you want, but... make me an offer we can't refuse."
What are they doing?
They're racking their brains but I think they're lost.
How can he help Jolbon... when he can't even satisfy me?
I'm off to see Buwiyum.
Will you make an offer?
Yes.
Tell me what you have.

I'm not kidding you.
"It pays crap, but the sandwiches are free."
I could work on your boat.

Why am I telling you all this?
Because... you're hoping I saved you half a sandwich.

"Please, have a seat."
"Pam, uh, wants you to know that if there's anything she can do..."
I appreciate that.
We're... both completely devastated by all this which...
makes it difficult to ask.
Then don't.
I wish I didn't have to.
But I'm under a cloud.
"And you put me there, Jeff."
I think you owe me a little clarity.
Clarity?
That's what you really want?
How many years have I known you and Pam?
Since law school.
That's a half a lifetime.
And the fact that you're not out there leading the charge for my nomination...
I'm waiting for the hearings.
To learn what?
To spare you the humiliation.
To find you a way out.
What are you talking about?
- Why don't you?
Or maybe you're scared.
Takes a strong man to admit his fears.
Fine.
I'll go myself.

"Mr. Harpel is playing every table at the high-roller pit, hundred thousand a hand."
"That's way above pattern, even for him."
Mmm.
"It stings, doesn't it?"
You have no idea.
Cézanne.
You have a good eye.
Harpel is a collector.
"Yes, I am aware of the fact that Harpel's a collector."
So you bought him a Cézanne to get him to gamble?
Not fair.
Fair?
That's a quaint American notion.
"You realize you're going to have to subtract the cost of this painting from your clients' total winnings, which is going to make it next to impossible... for you to win our little bet."
What is that?
Hmm?
[Sniffing] Is that the scent of desperation?
"[Chuckles] Understandable, I suppose, the way Harpel's been playing."
I'd guess I'm up on you by at least half a million.
"Oh, I doubt that."
"Anyway, I didn't buy the painting for Harpel."
I merely borrowed it for him to enjoy while he plays.
"Oh, you just borrowed it?"
Friends at the Musée d'Orsay.
Oh.
That's terrified.

There's got a friend over there.
Field cards from a patrolman Rossi of the 11-6.

Me and my wife are big fans.
"Now, she promised she'd send me a picture."
"But after seeing how confused she was, I wasn't so sure she'd remember."
But sure enough.
In what way confused?
Like a lost kid.
She said she got on the J train by mistake.
She was wandering around for about an hour.
- Was she on anything?
- Not that I could tell.
"I mean, she knew her name."
She just didn't know how to get home.
It was kind of sad.
- See?
- Great.
"What, did you put her in a cab back to the city?"
"Uh, no."
"I called the bus, sent her over to st."
Jim's.
I gave her a bunch of my cards too.
"Next time she gets lost, she can call me."
"I'll come pick her up, I'll take her home."
Great artist like her.
"EMERGENCY ROOM SAINTJAMES HOSPITAL THURSDAY, MARCH 2"
You know I can't tell you anything about Ms. Booth without a waiver.
"You know, I don't think I phrased my question right, doctor."
So...
So...
How do I get my money back?
What do you mean get your money back?
"- My 40,000 euros."
The judge has to give them back.
You told me so.
Wait.
Why do you think you were freed from jail?
The workings of the Holy Spirit?
Do you think the affidavit from the casino appeared by magic?
Wait... you used my money?
But... what did you want?
You wanted me to use mine?
- What's left?
- Nothing.
Do you know how many signatures are needed to get someone out of jail?
"Between the clerk, the judge, the guards... 40,000 euros goes quickly."
This money wasn't mine!
The guys who entrusted me with it will kill me!
"Tell them that the cops took it, that's it."
"40,000 euros in cash..."
I don't know many who could resist.
"These guys will never believe me, they'll rip my head off..."
"Mr Zeppini, you are free."
That's the most important thing.
"And if you need me, you know where to find me."
"Good luck, Mr Zeppini."
Shit!
That's enough.
I'm losing my concentration.
"See, this is our sesame."
- Yes.
Keep up the good work.
Boy-O.
"- What's up, Felix?"
- Nothing's up.
- You should make a move.
- On Gemma?
"End of term, mate, anything goes."
"That's not true, actually."
"Certain things definitely do not ""go."""
No matter how much you may want them to.
It's just a matter of confidence.
And this is an area where I may be able to help you out.
I'm so horny.
"Come on, let's do it dirty, any way you like."
"- Hi, Gemma."
"- Hiya, Felix."
- Can I have a word?
- Okay.
"I mean, obviously, you're out of my league, but I thought I'd ask just for clarification purposes."
Ask what?
If you'd like to go out with me sometime for something like a coffee or a film?
Sit.
Paul.
I don't think of you in the same way as you suspected.
But I'm sure there's someone out there who does.
You just have to be brave and keep looking.
"Okay, great, thanks."
"Seriously, you're very sweet and polite."
Unlike certain people I know.
So why do you go out with him?
"Truth or Dare, everyone."
You liar!
Chick fight!
He loved me!
Get off of me!
Stop it!
Hey!
Get off her!
Get off her!
Get up.
"How'd this guy die, Doctor?"
"As I told you, when I know, you'll know."
Know faster.
Shaving off your moustache has brought back your usual impatience.
Good.
Means I'm doing my job.
I do have a potential cause of death.
But it's by no means airtight.
See this fracture?
"Well, yeah, you're pointing right at it."
"The brain revealed an epidural hematoma, verified by this CAT scan."
Though it's far from massive.
"Statistically, it's only fatal in about 17% of cases."
Blunt-force trauma?
Most likely.
"We're looking at a baseball bat or a golf club, perhaps wielded by a disgruntled fiancée."
You tell me how;
I'll figure out who.
Intelligence has placed La Grenouille in Nairobi.
That might mean a shipment to Somalia.
We'll continue to monitor these activities.
Just do your best.
Mission trouble?
And we got saved by a girl.
"We might as well cut our nuts off, and turn them in to the dude sheriff, 'cause we don't deserve these badges that we call testicles."
We should just give our balls to that guy.
- Yeah.
"- I mean, he's a man."
He probably has three balls.
He definitely had horrible B.O.
I think that's a sign of giant balls.
- Rank.
- Lucky.
Testosterone stinks.
I smell like flowers.
These hands of mine are so soft.
It's like Chinese silk ribbon.
It's weird.
They've never done anything manly in my whole stupid life.
Not one thing.
I pet a llama once.
That's the manliest thing I've ever done.
"That was cool, though."
We went to that petting zoo.
All those cute ducks.
They were scary.
"Guys, this is what I'm talking about."
We're going to petting zoos when we should be slitting the throats of those animals.
"Yeah, we should slit throats of animals."
"We should be hunting or, like, pulling marlins out of the ocean or, like, doing..."
What do men do?
- We should go camping.
- Yes.
- At the Brianna concert.
- Yes.
"- Come on, don't start again now."
"- Yeah, yeah."
Hidalgo!
Put him on the bed.
"Look, a message."
- He was one of us?
- Nonsense.
He's particularly bad.
- He demands a lot of money for this.
"- So, what does it say?"
They're going to let us escape tomorrow.
And you're probably the reason why.
That's insane!
"They would let us rot and die in here, but as soon as one of the Great Leopard's men turns up, everything's sorted."
- Of course.
They're afraid that I might talk.
- Would you do that?
I haven't talked yet.
But it's not impossible.
I'm a mercenary.
I fight for money... not for my homeland.
"Padre Julio, what have you got for us?"
- Look what he's brought me!
"- Help me unload the truck, children."
I want something too!
You mustn't put yourself at risk by driving around just so we have something to eat.
"Who else is supposed to do it, then?"
- Have you found out anything?
- Carrasco and his men destroyed a bridge.
The supplies for the troops have been held up.
"Oh, and..."
I didn't need this.
"Well, I am, sir, aren't I?"
"- Nothing to worry about, sir."
"- Oh, I'm sure there's not."
I'm inquiring about a missing cabinet last seen in her possession.
- I don't know if you know anything?
- I've no idea.
"Now, please..."
"- Well, won't you come in?"
"- Yes, thank you."
This is Lord...?
- How do you do?
"- And this is Miss, um...?"
This is a most genial gentleman from the police.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Will you have a glass of sherry?
"Well, I'm not supposed to on duty, if you'll pardon the... word... but a small one for medicinal purposes."
- Splendid.
- Yes.
"Well, for what we are about to receive..."
"Oh, Mumsie, need we flee the country?"
If we made a clean breast of it...
Murdering a stranger by mistake?
Go and finish off that trunk.
How you can use that of all trunks?
(Screams)
- Now what?
- It's...
It's Daddy Batty.
He would come!
Get rid of him.
"We're going on holiday, remember?"
"Well, let me in."
-I don't believe it!
-It's got to be fake.
It's real.
That's why he's called Superman.
"Hey, Freddy, where did you find this place?"
Johnny Ola brought me here.
"I didn't believe it, but seeing is believing!"
"-I see it, but still don't believe it!"
"-50 bucks, Pat."
"Roth won't go here, but Johnny knows these places!"
"-Watch, he'll break a cracker with it."
-I want to see him break a brick!
"Relax, we're taking you to the hospital."
...and you'll continue to get those.
I don't believe that President Eisenhower would ever pull out of Cuba as we have over one billion dollars invested in this country.
The American public believe in non-intervention...
Fredo!
Where are you going?
"I'm getting a real drink, because I can't..."
What kept Mr. Roth?
I understood he was coming.
"Reeves, what's the protocol?"
How long should we stay?
I think a half hour ought to do it.
Just long enough to bring in the New Year.
It's New Year's Eve.
"Come on, just for a minute."
There's a plane waiting to take us to Miami in an hour.
Don't make a big thing about it.
"I know it was you, Fredo."
You broke my heart.
You broke my heart!
"Julie will get bored after a day, anyway."
"Want to go to a cardio bar, fashion island..."
Do I get a raise?
"- So, um..."
I appreciate what you're trying to do with the...
"- Okay, I'm reading here."
"- Oh, uh, take your time."
- I just wanted to let you know that you didn't do a bad job.
"- Your work isn't terrible, either."
"A little rushed, maybe."
"So, I've been thinking."
Um...
I owe you an apology.
"Well, several, actually."
You have to actually say the words.
That's kind of how it works.
"I would like to extend... to you a formal acknowledgment that I... may have, um, unintentionally..."
I'm sorry.
"Me, too."
I'm sorry.
- I-I'm sorry about the coffee and the... black eye and the... tampons.
"- Well, you can see why I thought you were intellectually"
I'm just...
I'm really glad that you're not.
"- Your, uh, penmanship, however..."
"- Hey, what's wrong with my penmanship?"
"- Nothing, just..."
"Just, next time, don't hold the pen between your toes."
"Oh, well, um, next time, don't spell ""canceling"" with two L's."
"Yeah, that's wrong."
You want to... you want to fix that?
- I...
Uncle...
Perhaps I have worn it too long...
General...
It looks like the kid is telling the truth.
We just received report that
Kwon Yul's entire army moved out to Soon-chun last night.
The contents of that letter are true?
And there was my father-in-law's report as well.
He paid one thousand heads to Jin Lin for it.
It has to be true.
Yi Soon-shin has left Noryang open?
Is this assign from god?
Send a report to General Shimazu.
We must pass through Noryang tonight at full speed and strike Yi Soon-shin from the rear!
"Yes, sir!"
Yoshihiro!
Aye!
Check the assault team for readiness once again.
They have to be right there on Yi Soon-shin's command ship the moment that we attack his fleet and throws them into confusion.
Is that understood?
Aye!
Honey!
Honey!
Honey!
Honey!
My son!
We've decided to let you live.
"If we win the battle, your lives will be spared."
You will be our oarsmen!
Row the oars on the ships that will destroy Yi Soon-shin!
No way!
You want me to dirty my hands and row a Japanese ship?
It's a leopard.
Around here?
He's probably lost and hungry.
Thinks he has supper up that tree.
Over there.
That's Sally he's got treed.
"Ok, fellas, let's get that leopard."
Wait a minute.
This is leopard territory.
A gunshot could bring on 30 or 40 more of them.
Yeah.
Five of us could never handle that many deadly leopards.
But what about Sally?
"As long as she's in the tree, she's ok."
Jack and I will tranquilize the leopard.
Quietly.
"Ok, we'll keep you covered."
"Sergeant, you follow right behind Mr. Makula."
"Captain, I think it might be safer for all of us if you gentlemen stayed under cover."
"Look, we just wanna help."
What difference does it make what we do?
The difference is we're using tranquilizer darts.
You're using real bullets.
I have no desire to be a battle casualty.
Come on.
"Well, now, what have we here?"
Who is that fancy looking chimp?
"Why it must be Sally, the world-famous astro-chimp."
- What are they doing?
"- Sergeant, we're moving in."
Hold it.
"Well, if that's the case, we better keep pretty far away from her."
"All of a sudden you had to get this off your chest, huh?"
"To be honest, it wasn't really my idea."
"After yesterday, Mary found out that I was using again, and she hired a private nurse to come to my house and make sure I stayed clean."
Nice friend.
She demanded...
That I come down here and I-I tell you the truth.
"And what is the truth, Desmond?"
Mary.
"Mary, I was just about to call you..."
I'm in trouble.
What... what do you mean?
"Grady Burgess, Des's dealer."
I came to see to him to tell him to leave Des alone.
"Help me, please."
He drugged me.
He's going to kill me.
"Okay, stay on the line, okay?"
Keep talking to me.
Where are you?
1287 Monu-ment...
Monument.
Mary?
Mary?
Shit.
So you're saying Mary had...
nothing to do with this.
"Mm-hmm, that's right."
"The truth is, I couldn't pay my drug debt because of the whole lost license ordeal."
Grady knew about my work with the terminally ill.
"He said that if I gave him our client list that he'd forgive me my debt, which I did, which was... stupid."
Go to Grady's house.
"You'll find a vault full of drugs, including pentobarbital."
There were certain errors in your report of the incident.
Don't tell me the guys in Washington ref used?
Those guys decided to award the Congressional Medal to Drake and the Distinguished Service Cross to the officer with him.
How's that?
The congressional.
Won't you look pretty standing up there?
Maybe he'll even let you sit on his piano.
- With the newsreels grinding.
- ln Technicolor.
What's the gripe?
That's the best they've got.
You shouldn't have done it!
Sometimes you go soft-headed.
I'd like to see a blond do that to me.
- What's the gimmick?
- Basic grammar.
- l'll bet she talks beautif ully now.
- Think so?
You look like the first time you jumped.
"Look, kid, if it's trouble...."
"Yeah, we had some, didn't we?"
"Not like this, though."
Quit living inside there.
If you can't tell me-- l can tell you.
I just don't want any medal.
is that all you don't want?
- Captain Murdock?
- On the hoof.
Camera boys would like shots of you two.
Could you come out?
You only stop here f or 5 minutes.
- The city of brotherly love?
We'll make sure no one knows that you were involved.
"Oh, god, no, no."
Please.
"Mr. McGovern, you're under arrest."
- Stay here with your son until we get back.
"- Please, you can't do this."
- Where's Dr. Robert Swan?
- In the O.R.
"This is my son, please."
You can't go in there.
You'll contaminate the room.
Who the hell are you?
Police.
Please stop what you're doing.
"I have to close this man's incision, and you have to get out of here before he gets infected."
- Where's his kidney?
- Right there.
- And it's going into Kyle McGovern.
"- No, it's not."
It's evidence.
And you're under arrest for trafficking in human body parts.
Now close him up.
I've got less than 24 hours to transplant that kidney.
"Doctor, you're not transplanting anything."
"Just, please, get changed."
"I'm not going anywhere until that doner wakes up, and Kyle McGovern is transferred to a hospital."
- What happened to Kyle?
- He's in hypertensive crisis.
His blood pressure is through the roof.
He needs a kidney in the next few days.
- He's on the transplant list.
- I have a kidney for this dying boy.
I'll be right there.
I don't want Chris to see this.
"-Well, what's wrong?"
What is it?
-Shh.
You're convinced that it's genuine?
I don't know.
"No, not really, I suppose."
But I have made a prudent judgment that it meets the conditions set down in The Ritual.
You would want to do the exorcism yourself?
Yes.
Might be best to have a man with experience.
Maybe someone who's spent time in foreign missions.
"I understand, Your Excellency."
Let's see who's around.
"In the meantime, I'll call you as soon as I know."
"Thank you, Your Excellency."
"Well, he does know the background."
I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist.
"There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway."
What about the exorcist?
Have you any ideas?
How about Lankester Merrin?
Merrin?
I had a notion he was in Iraq.
I read he was working on a dig near Nineveh.
"You're right, but he's finished."
He came back three or four months ago.
He's at Woodstock now.
"What's he doing there, teaching?"
He's working on another book.
"Don't you think he's too old, Tom?"
So what does he like?
"Well, I kind of just gathered that so far he likes sitting on people's shoulders and sneezing on the top of my head, so..."
Okay.
"Well, um, I'm gonna go."
"Will, it was really nice to meet you."
Can I get a high-five?
- No?
OK.
- All right.
"Anyway, should we go show off to all of Detroit?"
My ring says yes.
Yoohoo!
"Dude, I can't believe you didn't tell me about proposing."
Give me a break.
I didn't tell anyone.
"Well, you told Backstreet Boys"
You didn't tell me and I'm your emotional guidance counsellor.
You know it's like I'm your sensei.
I don't speak Japanese and neither do you.
"Anyway, see this is the kind of thing we need to cherish."
Okay?
Our banter.
Our back and forth.
It's awesome.
"We've got to love this while we can because you're engaged and we may only be be living together another 7, 8, 9, 10 years."
- Who's engaged for 11 years?
- Turtles.
OK.
I didn't...
I didn't know 7-year-olds can improv like that.
"Actually, since Candace has her house we thought it might be romantic if I moved"
- in on Valentine's day.
Is everything a joke to you?
Hey...
"I figure one day we're going to be buried here ourselves, and I"
"think it would be nice if our kids came and, and joked around with us."
I hope that's not for a really long time.
How we doing?
We've got about 200 men.
That includes Dale's crew.
"We got more coming, right?"
"Oh, they're trickling in."
It's taking a lot longer than we thought.
Saying good-bye to their families.
"Jake, Eric, get on down to the pass."
Get everybody organized.
We don't have a whole lot of time before their advance unit hits.
Not you.
Why not?
Because these people elected you their leader.
We protect you at all costs.
"And, besides, in a few minutes,"
I'm going to need your help.
Help with what?
Arming our tank.
Our daughter is out there carrying a rifle and... and I'm in here.
Sam needs you here.
"You know, Allie's safe."
"She's been assigned to Town Hall, and the fighting is miles from there."
"Right now, there really isn't anything else you can be doing."
Here we go.
Jake?
"Jake, you are about to have company."
Already?
Looks like she didn't suffer.
Sometimes...
"For some, death is a kind of deliverance."
"That's it, a gun shot, 12 gauge... almost point blank She died on the spot,"
And... the young black man?
"At first glance, from what the ambulance guy said.."
brain dead... most probably.
"As for the lady... she'II be on the table around 1 1 :00am, so my report should be on your desk around 3:00pm."
"I can send it to montreal, if you prefer."
No big deal.
"We'II take it, to hell with the montreal guys."
It's a change from horse theft and conjugal violence.
"Are you sure, Gary?"
"Yeah, sure."
alright then.
"We'II talk around 3:00, 3:30."
Perfect.
Bye.
What more do we have here?
"There are 3, 4 witnesses inside, there's this."
The neighbors say it belongs to the victim.
There's this.
Three cartridges.
"One was found near the victim, another here, in the grass."
"One is part of those over there, probably shot at martial."
How is he?
Not so good.
Quite a shock.
Anything on what started it?
"Yeah, it's all over there."
It started here alright.
"could be the young black guy, we found his bicycle."
Maurice:
The king plans to behead her within the week.
Francesca:
He's accused you of adultery.
"Clarissa, dear, listen to me."
I'm your mother.
Let yourself be loved.
It'll take us hours to dig her a grave.
There's no one around to check us.
Catherine:
Make the blow sure and quick.
Remember I've paid you extra.
I don't want my children
To see you hacking at me.
Don't break the clasp.
I've promised this to one of my ladies.
Prawns?
My youngest daughter can't eat them.
The flowers.
"Full vases, cascading bouquets..."
Where are they?
We were told by the king to save them
For the actual day.
I need to see their placement.
What about the wine?
"100 casks, flowing freely."
The nobles will expect it.
"Yes, let them drink and swim in my blood"
And wonder who among them is next
Once that bastard sebastian takes the throne.
"Come in, please."
I'm nearly ready.
"And how he had, like, eight surgeries."
"This is in the middle of us trying to hook up,"
- she starts telling me that.
- Ugh.
"And I was just like, yeah, I can't."
I can't do it.
"And I'm sorry, but all I kept thinking was, is that gonna happen to me if I have sex with her?"
"Like, you're gonna catch her son's thing?"
"I know it's totally irrational, but that's what I kept thinking."
"Like, it's her vagina's fault and I'm not going anywhere near that vagina."
What's the oldest woman you would have sex with?
The oldest I've had sex with is 48.
How old were you?
17.
- Was that your virginity?
- Yes.
"- Oh, my God."
- Really?
- You lost your virginity to an older woman.
"- Oh, yeah."
You must be-
"- You should be great in bed, then."
- No...
"- No, there's no way."
- She was a real pro.
- Really?
"I couldn't keep up, yeah, and I think it scarred me."
That's why I would assume you were great.
"Was she a real pro, like..."
"I think she was a prostitute, but she didn't charge me."
Okay.

I do what I can to help.
I take care of the day-to-day things so he's free to focus on his work.
Try and keep him happy so his mind can focus on being creative.
Cook him his favourite food.
That sort of thing.
Tonight I've cooked him pilchards.
Hmm.
Bob loves pilchards.
There you are.
- There's a lot more than I'd expected.
We've been at it for hours.
"- We have, haven't we?"
I want to apologise for the other day.
- There's no need.
I should never have put Dr Campbell in that position... or said half the things I did.
I understand.
I can't imagine how it must feel to think of your child going to fight.
What...?
- It's heading for the village.
"If Will doesn't need me, I'll be straight back."
Do you want a lift?
Thank you!
What happened?
- I heard Bob shouting for help.
I found him being violently sick and doubled up in pain on the hall floor.
"We need to go, Doc!"
- Tell Pat.
Ah...
Pat?
Come in.
Will asked me to let you know Bob won't be discharged until tomorrow afternoon at the earliest.
My name's Tanya Chambers.

"I would have rather just brought him to a vet, to be honest,"

- Hooroo!
I'm here to fix your snake!
"Here, I brought Scandal with me to keep your snake calm, 'cause snakes like other snakes."
Whoa!
Did it die already?
"Oh, no, she's just resting."
"Thank you so much for coming, we're really worried about her."
Lizzie is the last gift that my mother got me before...
I'm sorry.
"I just think if she died, it would be like losing my mom all over again."
We really appreciate you being here.
"Cool, do you guys have any food?"
I feel like something hot.
"Um, we have some soup left over."
Does it have any meat or sausage in it?
- No.

"Uh, Lizzie means a great deal to Amy and I, so..."
Bloody hell.
You're Fozzie Bear who's been ripped up and used to smuggle heroin.
A Nazi doctor.
I don't even know what the fuck you are.
This is not about serving yourselves.
This is about serving the president.

Are you OK?
Yes.
Do you recognize him?
I don't.
I think I do.
He's a Haengin soldier we met on your first trip as our leader.
Why do they want me dead?
Even if he had a grudge... there's no way a soldier would attack a troop.
It could become a political issue.
You came back alone?
A bodyguard attacked us.
What?
You pathetic fool!
Forgive me!
Forgive me!
Forgive me!
- Call in my men!
"- Yes, sir."
What did you find out?
"The Haengin commander we traded with... (Sayong, Yuntabal's tactician) was Baemang."
His superiors caught him... trying to embezzle the gold he was supposed to pay us with.
They kicked him out of the army.
He and his men then became bandits.
Bandits?
"(Kepil, Yuntabal's assistant) You mean she was attacked by bandits?"
Yes.
I should've killed him then and there.
This is serious.
They used to be soldiers so they should be very well trained.
This really is bad.
We don't stand a chance against them.
Now they know our size and location.
I have the cat wrangler here for you.
"Oh, is it that horrible little--Hi."
Hey.
Greta Johannsen.
"It's short for ""LaGreta."""
"Hi, great to see you again."
You too.
I'm here to introduce you to feline actors you're gonna be working with tonight.
Okay.
This is Po-Po.
And this here is Captain Boots.
Hello.
"Uh, would you describe yourself as ""cat competent?"""
"Oh, yes."
I love cats.
I used to have two cats.
"But then I moved to this place with hardwood floors, so we had to put them down."
I'm joking.
"I've done several focus groups, on this show, and what I've gleaned--"
"The blonde, big-eyed girl is popular with women and older gays."
"Jenna, that's my friend Jenna."
"And the kid with the funny hair is liked by women, but you're missing men between 18 and 49."
"I'm not missing them, they're just not there."
I think I can fix that.
"So your job is, you take things that are already working, and you fix them."
That's a great job.
"Okay, let's-- Why don't we, um--"
You're missing that third kind of heat.
I want you to think about Tracy Jordan.
Okay--the black guy?
The black movie star.
"I flew with him on a private jet to the Super Bowl recently, and I found him very entertaining."
"He's our man, Leo."
"OK, so he disliked Dave Stubbs' world view?"
What about the others?
Why not?
Why stop at one?
Especially if you have a supposed philosophical justification for it.
I read his articles.
All that struff about the universe being indifferent to pain and suffering.
"And there being no point in using terms like ""good"" and ""evil""."
You remember the piece I told you about?
This is a guy who sees no objection to people suffering if it is necessary for the production of a great man.
I don't know.
Hello?
Tom?
It's Nikki.
Is this a bad moment?
"Ah, no worse than usual."
You sound like you're in a train station.
"Yeah, there's Lots of people coming and going here."
Listen.
The paper in Dave Stubbs' stomach.
It's an article he wrote for Ethics Today.
"Before he was buried alive, I think he was forced to swallow it."
Who would want to make him eat his own words?
The creep who doesn't need a crutch.
You shouldn't be using that in here.
It's police business.
Tom?
Where are you?
I'll tell you later.
I've gotta go.
sorry.
Welcome to Scabland.
"It was disgusting, but beautifully photographed."
- It was supposed to be disgusting.
- I'm sure it was.
"Mom, all this stuff."
Excuse me.
"All of this equipment, it can't be here."
We won't leave all of this equipment here for everybody to trip over.
We are not cretins.
She's handling it.
"Right, Mom, you are handling it?"
- This lighting sucks.
- Can we do something about the lighting?
"I don't think so, ma'am."
I don't know.
"It's a community college, we'll have to cope."
Think documentary.
"Mom, please."
People will be showing up here soon.
"Lorelai, I'm perfectly capable of handling this."
No one will be inconvenienced.
Okay.
I'm just gonna let everyone deal with all of this... because I need to relax and get a cup of coffee... and maybe hammer a nail into my head.
"You're not needed here, Lorelai."
Go get your coffee.
Relax.
"You're going to redo your makeup later, aren't you?"
Maybe an Irish coffee.
I haven't even heard of half these bands.
I love that about this place.
Lane would want to live here.
Who's Slint?
"Smart, sneaky girl!"
He will not return.
Varun knows everything.
"If he'd come here to catch me, even after seeing me, why didn't he come to me?"
Why should he follow me?
"That simple means, he has no concrete evidence so far."
He won't get any evidence hereafter as well.
But...
The important thing is that he should not reach Vikram at any point.
Vikram.
- Priya.
I guess you can sense that I'm not fine.
"Priya, don't worry."
I am not able to...
My mind is not at peace.
"Tomorrow, everything should go well."
The organ dealer should properly arrange everything.
The transplant for my brother should go well.
"With all these things running in my mind,"
I'm not able to stay normal.
I don't think I can stay alone here.
"If you are with me,"
I'll feel better.
I've been feeling the same way since I dropped you.
I shouldn't have left you alone.
I'll come there right away.
I'll be with you till everything ends well.
Okay?
"Thanks, Vikram."
Sir.
- Hey!
Where had you gone?
Miyu
Why are you doing this?
"You broke up with that guy, you should come home"
Why didn't you tell me?
I was planning on going home but thought I'd stay a little longer
Why?
Did you think that coming back home wasn't cool?
You were showing off like this amateur virgin?
Nope.
It's just more fun being here
You're having fun doing this job?
"Yep, it's very fun"
Why?
You won't understand
Why not?
Cause you're a virgin
Thanks for everything.
Now it's my turn to work for you.
There's something I want to do with you the day after tomorrow.
What?
Hold hands and walk together.
"Hello, package delivery for you."
"Sure, okay..."
Just a moment.
Coming.
"That'll be 1,280 yen, cash on delivery."
Thank you very much.
It's the book we ordered online.
Don't you think we're fine after all this time?
"No, just hang in for two more days."
"Well, 38 hours to be precise."
"Please, just be patient."
"That's why I'm even telling you guys this to begin with, because, you know, when things like this happen, sometimes people talk about them."
"You might hear something at school, or you might see Miles or even me on television, and I just wanted to prepare you for it."
I don't understand.
Why would you be arrested?
"Well, I don't know, and that's just it."
It's possible that some people connected with this project did bad things.
That you didn't know about.
That I did not know about.
- Why would you be arrested?
- l'm not going to be arrested.
I'm not going to be arrested.
"I do not want you to worry about this, all right?"
I'm just trying to prepare you in case people talk about it.
Okay?
"- Yeah, okay."
- Yeah?
Okay?
It's really okay.
I have to leave anyway.
"No, it's ready."
"If I could find the syrup... lf we have it, it's in that cabinet right there."
- Of course.
- [knock on door]
That's Mom.
- Hey.
"- Hey, sweetie."
- Are you all ready to go?
"- Yeah, I was, um..."
"- Oh, hi."
"- Hi, Karen."
They're ready.
I was just giving Jessie some waffles.
Who's this?
"Oh, it's the Director of Clandestine Operations Overseas."
Somebody's boss's boss's boss.
Somebody high up in the company.
Director Atwater.
Director Collins.
Templeman.
Keep going.
"Yeah, these are people being groomed for top slots in the corporation."
"Go back, go back."
I know that man.
That's my fucking boss.
Fifteen dossiers.
Fifteen broadcasts.
There it is.
"If I wanted to cripple the system in one fell swoop, these would be the 1 5 I'd start with."
"You kill these men today, you won't recognize the world when you wake up in the morning."
But they've already sent the broadcasts.
"I mean, what the hell do they want with us?"
They wanna kill us.
Make sure you don't cancel the broadcasts.
Grab that.
Let's go.
Here.
"That's all the information from the laptop, in case, uh... I don't know, in case we don't get out of here."
Drink that.
"""Of course we'll get out of here, Katherine."
"Don't you worry about a thing."""
You ever get used to it?
Used to what?
Bodies.
Dead people.
Which really is quite bloody strange.
But I'll take a shaving and test it later.
Come here.
I'm glad you're uh... moving on from Anna.
It's about time.
"Whoa, whoa."
That's not what's happening.
I still love her.
But does she still love you?
Course she bloody does.
OK.
"Look, I'm just saying."
Sometimes a broken Rolex is just a watch which won't work anymore.
"Right, Confucius."
MAN:
I am aware that my arrival has been the subject of speculation.
"It's no secret that in this department, in this police force, there have been sins committed."
And that's why I'm here.
And why my predecessor's enjoying an early retirement.
- Now I'm sure I come with a...
- (DOOR OPENS)
With a certain reputation.
But I like to think I'm fighting on the side of the angels.
It's just that I tend to hold a very big stick while I'm doing it.
I want London to be proud of its police force.
And I'll do anything to help make that happen.
(DOOR OPENS)
This is Kayleigh Fenchurch.
Former dancer at the Pleasure Palace.
"Yeah, I know who she is, Doug."
"Why's she next to my victim, Freddie Lau?"
Because she was strangled too.
This is Mukesh calling.
Sorry.
Who is there ma?
Somebody's got the wrong address.
What are you doing here?
Leave!
My husband can come anytime!
Did he hit you?
What else do you expect?
A trophy?
"My sisters are coming, I need my money."
Are you done?
They rescheduled my appointment for tomorrow.
Breakfast!
"Johnny bhai, I need a favour?"
What?
You will have to go to that lady's house the one that you met with me.
Why don't you go yourself?
My aunt lives in the same colony if she sees me there...
What work do you have with her?
Sleeping through the day begets bad luck my friend!
She says that your due has already been paid to you.
Your lady friend didn't even let me enter the house!
She started shouting and threatening me saying that she will call her husband!
They have given your number to the cops even filed a report against you...
What the hell are you upto?
You will get me into trouble as well
Screwed up my work.
Got me thrown out of the house.
And now she says she will not pay me!
Bitch!
Does she think I am scared of her and her husband!
"Yes, sir."
"And thank you, sir."
In view of the fact that the deposit was so small this procedure is a little unusual.
"Miss Howell, would you please leave my house?"
I have some very important business to discuss with Mrs. Ryan.
"Come into the garden, my dear."
How do you like it?
It's lovely.
All those wonderful flowers.
"Oh, that's nothing,"
I'm going to have some orchids flown in from Hawaii.
But what a beautiful setting.
"You know, a place like this inspires romance, don't you think?"
How long is it since you lost your husband?
Five years.
And you've been without a companion all that time?
I'm doing alright.
I want you to give a party.
Invite all your friends.
We'll celebrate.
Celebrate what?
My making $20.000?
That's nothing.
"Well, there'll be much more in the future."
Future?
I'm going to Europe soon.
Why go to Europe.
I've brought Europe to you.
"You're a fast worker, aren't you?"
In my country I'm considered a slowpoke.
We weren't even formally introduced yet.
I think we know each other pretty well.
The keys!
"Beautiful evening, Constable."
Beautiful evening.
Mr X was then pushed into the pond.
"I don't know why you did it, but if that isn't worth double what I asked, I'm a Dutchman."
It was a dummy.
We...
I was working out a plot.
"Pinching a plot, don't you mean?"
What would your chum say?
Therefore I suggest a contract making over 50 per cent of all your future royalties forever.
- Impossible.
"- Then I'll send an anonymous letter, telling police to drag the pond and name you as the culprit."
- Mumsie!
Mumsie!
- Go away!
"But, Mumsie, the keys!"
You've got the keys!
In my raincoat pocket.
Hurry.
Don't say there's someone else for the high jump.
What about the money you mentioned?
I couldn't get it.
It may be a few days.
"Well, the new deal will be £5,000 down in advance of the 50 per cent."
When may I hope to see the cash and contract?
"Why, you...!"
My agent is away.
Come the day after tomorrow evening at nine o'clock.
"Well, don't let me down this time."
- No.
- Good.
"- I'm going to get a farm, maybe something simple,"
"I'm going to start a practice, a fertility clinic"
"Dr. Conner, helping bring light into the world."
The only thing I need is Natasha.
Ah!
"I remember where it is, it's this way!"
Let's get a drink.
I'm so totally weirded out right now.
- It was so weird!
"- Oh, come on, it happens."
- Peter was defending him!
- Who?
- The jackass.
"- Oh, the jackass."
"He said it was an ""accident""."
"Well, that's a way of looking at it, or it's criminal negligence causing death."
Exactly.
Why didn't I say that?
"Well, my guess is that there's plenty of weirdness to come."
What?
You're moving to Dallas with a man you barely know.
"It's going to be a voyage of discovery, that's for sure."
I gotta get downstairs.
I'm going to try to get your brother's job back for him.
Anybody hear from him?
"Sandy hasn't heard from him, neither has Zoe."
"OK, it's just been a couple of days, give him some time to cool off,"
- then if I can just...
"- He's not cooling off, Dad."
He's in a crack den somewhere.
You don't know that.
None of us know that.
I feel so glamorous.
Damn it.
Jill's already with the Earl.
"Look at her over there, shamelessly flirting with him."
Maybe I should just go home.
"No, you can't."
That's quitter talk.
"If you don't go down fighting, what does that do for us?"
Who look up to you.
What's the use?
"Look, he's already interested in..."
Hello.
"You move like an angel, as if you were floating across the room."
"Thank you for remarking on my grace, your grace."
Ah.
"Beluga, my favorite."
- I simply adore beluga.
- I adore it more.
Mm-hmm.
Delicious.
"Poor child, have you never had caviar?"
You must be so sheltered and naive.
"Well, I'm certainly not as worldly and experienced as some."
Perhaps the Earl would like to hear a story of a woman who's been ridden by more men than the London underground.
Or perhaps the Earl would like to see a recent photo of a woman with a mustache.
"I'm not sure that I would, actually."
"Who do you want the Earl to end up with,"
Joy mouse or Jill mouse?
Of course I'm rooting for Joy.
"Well, obviously I'm rooting for Joy too."
- But it's gonna be Jill.
- Totally.
Great.
But what I'm getting at is what were the autopsy results?
Why do you people keep making me relive this nightmare?
Because you're the coroner!
Good point.
What was the cause of death?
Cause?
"Well, um..."
"Sir, there are so many causes of death nowadays."
"Um, murder, disease, loneliness - that's the real killer."
That's what finally got the roadrunner.
"Your honour, the witness is really pissing me off!"
"Mr. Diamond, answer the question."
"Well, I would if he would stop misleading me."
Come on!
What was the cause of death?
What?
What got him?
What?
"Come on, what was the cause of death?"
What was the cause of death?
"Well, I don't know the cause of death."
Because I never finished the autopsy.
There!
Satisfied?
"Fine, we'll just have to do it again."
This is good.
I'm ordering that the body of Mayor Bowman be exhumed first thing in the morning.
Very good.
"Oh, it's gonna be gross."
It's gonna be disgusting.
Is that the ring for the tipster hotline or the suicide hotline?
Safe?
"What do you mean, safe?"
Make her stop that.
She's making me nervous.
Get out of my way.
It's no time to do a thing like that!
Annie!
Take your foot off.
Annie!
Take your trunk off.
"Annie, please go back!"
"That's gold, bugler."
"Look at it, bugler."
That's yours and mine.
"Archibald Cutter, the blooming duke, look at me, and Rajah Gunga Din... pouring diamonds out of that there blinking water bag."
Bugle will be very satisfactory.
"Come on, Din."
The world is ours.
Kali.
"Sahib, come quick."
"Thugs, lift up your faces... to the light that shines from Kali's throne."
Brothers in Thuggee... we are the friendless of this earth.
Every man's hand is against us.
"We have been kicked, spat upon... and driven to the hills like wild things."
"My father was a Thug, and he was hanged."
His father was blown from a cannon's mouth.
"And what of your kinsmen, your fathers and their fathers... and their fathers' fathers before them?"
"My brothers, a new day is at hand."
"I have read the omens, and they are good."
"Three nights ago, a jackal screamed upon the left."
Another answered from the right at once.
"What does that mean, my brothers?"
That may help you at the bottom end.
"But at the top end, it means earlier, you know, David."
So I wish we could do better for you.
Your patience is gonna be tried.
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"There is, but it ain't-- the movies-- at least,"
"In our movies, the shooting schedule, it means very little,"
Because things happen.
"Shit happens, you know."
So you got to let me know if there's some problem.
You know what I mean?
"Hopefully, things will be better as we go on with this thing."
"But there are gonna be unexpected things, and--"
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
It won't happen.
I'd love it.
"No one would like it more than I,"
But I don't think we will get it.
I just am afraid we will not get it.
"This stuff, we had a lot of actors."
"So maybe, you know-- maybe tomorrow"
Will be a little easier.
I don't know.
[Laughs] He cant' leave.
I told him to dye his hair.
"I told you I needed to make his hair black,"
Because otherwise it looked like-- people
Was saying it's Tromaville.
But now I don't know where he is.
We're late again.
"Every day, it's late."
"It's fucking-- we're shooting exteriors, right?"
"Stenz worked for the CIA, right?"
Right.
If we can track the way that Walker contacted..
"these guys, we can figure out how to stop them."
How do you propose we do that?
Keep an eye on Caulfield.
"Wait, what?"
Hi.
I'm Carol.
I'm not supposed to talk to you right now.
Run a database search on the guys in that building.
"CIA, NSA, everything you've got."
"Okay, listen, Walker's not doing this for the money, trust me."
There is something else going on.
"I can't do that, ma'am."
On the worst day that our country has ever had..
you could be the key to figuring all of this out.
Couldotherwisenotaccomplishthat  is take back the White House.
I'm gonna have to get that out.
When did you become a doctor all of a sudden?
"Look, just talk to me, get my mind off it."
Talk to me about your daughter.
Emily?
She's completely in love with you.
She even tried to get me to vote for you.
You didn't vote for me?
Your daughter's smart.
You should listen to her.
She was like 3 when I enlisted.
And to be honest with you..
I was probably just running from my marriage.
"Right after I deployed, Emily was watching TV.."
Really?
"I sensed you in the forest, when you were watching us, and I knew even then that you were different."
Your father has raised you well.
He has taught you right from wrong.
You are not like the other one.
I don't let him in.
I don't like what he shows me.
"I know, but you have to try."
"Now, we need to find him."
You don't understand.
"I have tried myself, but I can get nothing."
Please.
All right.
Good.
"Now, concentrate."
Try again.
I saw a river.
Zaddik?
Is there a river nearby?
"Yes, just to the east."
"All right, let's go."
"McKay, stay here and help Beckett."
"Uh, medical research is not really my thing."
And hunting wraith?
"But, I mean, I can stay..."
and help Beckett.
Never could get into biology.
There's just too much information about the human body.
"One time, I took it as an undergrad,"
I diagnosed myself with half a dozen separate medical conditions before I had to drop the class.
Really.
"Yeah, believe it or not, back then, I was a bit of a hypochondriac."
People are concerned.
"You have been a rock-- stable, rational."
This case has tripped a wire somewhere.
Ahem.
"Oh, my God."
You are more like Billy than you realize.
You both need someone to fight and to hate and to destroy.
You can't just be.
I loved Billy.
I truly did.
Once.
We were quite a team.
"You couldn't stand him, Donald."
"Eventually no, but in the beginning I loved him."
- Until you didn't.
"- Until I didn't because he was weak, because he drank, because he never really stood for anything."
That's what you do.
"People fall, and you just let them keep falling."
"Oh, come on."
Are you going to help Lucy?
I know that you care about her.
She just might be the one thing to make you happy.
She made me happy.
But she was weak.
Ahem.
Lawyers are reminded-- opening statements are not arguments.
They're road maps to let the juries know what evidence they can expect to hear.
Plaintiff has the burden of proof and delivers the first opening statement.
Billy:
Cool.
"Um... okay, let's do this."
How are you guys doing?
He shut me down.
Boom!
Gone.
See ya.
It was cold.
Yet you found it hot.
"No,I mean,he was hot while he happened to be shutting me down, but it's not like the shutting down itself was hot."
I really think he's changed.
"Yeah,he's changed into a guy that doesn't like you anymore."
And it happened the same exact time he became more appealing.
Weird.
"Dude,he totally still likes me."
I don't know what you're getting so indignant about.
You won't even kiss me when I get my sideburns trimmed like a quarter of an inch too short.
"When they're too short,your chin looks huge."
I warn you about that before every haircut.
- Bella.
"- Oh,jeez."
didn't Vivian almost break up with me one time for wearing Crocs?
"I'm kind of still kind of asleep,Aug."
You're supposed to love me no matter what.
Anything I do.
Whatever.
That's ridiculous.
"So,if you put on 200 pounds and become a serial killer,"
I'm supposed to just roll with that?
"Like normal things,Augie."
"Like,what if I suddenly grew a disgusting mole out of my back,like Bella."
Ew.
You grew something.
Let me see.
- No.
I'm not done with you yet.

You'll have to forgive my boyfriend.
He's not accustomed to women talking to him like that.
Oh.
He should visit the states.
I'd like to see that.
"I have to say, you're not what I expected."
"Most of Simon's girlfriends want something from him-- trips, jewelry, marriage."
"Oh, I'm in no rush to get married."
And I don't like expensive jewelry.
I'm just enjoying the moment.
"Well, whatever it is, it must be something special."
I've never seen Simon this happy before.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Maybe a little later.
It's bad luck in Cuba to turn down a dance.
And I really would love to get to know your new friend.
"- Sure, it sounds fun."
- Okay.
I've never met a mid-level museum worker with so many opinions on international affairs.
"Well, I travel a lot."
It's a perk of the job.
"Well, what about your sister?"
What kind of work does she do?
Do they go out frequently?
Juan says he wants to live with Clara.
She's crazy.
He also says you're still in love with mom.
And that you'll always be.
I don't understand why all men are after her.
It was always like that.
Are you in love with mom?
Me?
No.
Love vanishes.
And it never comes back.
"When we decided to split up, my wife assumed that I was leaving and she was keeping the house."
That's what happens usually.
I think it's not fair.
But surprisingly I accepted that as something natural.
Someone had to leave.
"We could've flipped a coin, for example."
And where did you go?
To a hotel.
Even now I still ask myself what I was doing in that room all alone..
Awake and looking at the ceiling.
But wasn't there another woman?
"-Yes, Rosa."
It took some days until I told her I've left Clara.
Why?
I don't know why I didn't go to my parents house in the very beginning either.
And you had a woman..
And a house waiting for you?
And you went to a hotel?
I was there for a few days without unpacking the bags.
Then I reacted and I called Jacoba to tell her I was coming over.
That's what I keep telling myself.
Of course I'd do it again if I had to.
"I mean, it's my job."
- Hold that thought.
I gotta change tapes.
"- This is great stuff, guys."
"I mean, really, really, really good stuff."
Real true-to-life.
- I love it.
- Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
"All right, come on down.!"
Set it right here.!
That's good.!
"Move, move, move.!"
I want you over there.
Hey!

As you can see behind me... the San Diego P.D. and the C.H.P. are working feverishly... to create an impenetrable wall of force... here at the gateway into Mexico... in hopes of stopping this heinous chase from crossing the border.
Is such a radical measure safe for the captive Miss Voss?
"The San Diego P.D. says yes, the critics say no... but only time will tell."
"Hello, San Diego."
"Afternoon, Newport."
What are you doing?
- I was going to offer you a piece of gum.
- Oh.

- You could have mace.
"If I had mace, I would have used it by now."
You're not a smart criminal.

Not today.

Perhaps tomorrow.
May I ask you a few questions?
Very good.
What are you actually doing here?
You're very talkative.
Everything begins when we start to think for ourselves.
That's the basis for every change.
"The problem is, we have no idea about the products and goods, we continually use."

We all head out...

"This isn't about you,dad!"
You've humiliated yourself and your whole family.
It is about us!
"I am the one who's in trouble here,okay?"
Not you!
Everything's not about you!
What you do reflects on us.
"Gosh,would you just shut up and just let me talk!"

He was beyond disturbed

- Doesn't mean he'd take his own life.
"He was pretty rattled the last time I saw him, too."
He was desperate to give me something... a locket.
What does a locket have to do with lionel luthor falling 40 stories from his office window?
Mr. Luthor...

I'm waiting until she gets in a quieter condition.
-Try to understand her and be nice to her.

She wasn't expecting to find us in such a place.
-AII right.

"Ooh, hey, hey."
And a Pop Tart?
"Oh, well, if you want a Pop Tart,"
I do not have to go downstairs.
You have a problem.
"Hey, buddy."
"Oh, thank God it's you, man."
I was so scared to come out of my room.
But I really needed a drink of water.
I almost let Clementine get it for me.
Clementine's in your room?
N-No.
"All right, look, this is crazy."
You got your mom right where you want her right now.
You need to take advantage of it.
- What do you mean?
"- What's one thing you've always wanted to do, but your mom wouldn't let you do?"
Go to Tijuana.
Then you go to Tijuana right now!
How can she possibly say no when she won't even look you in the eye?
You really think she would let me go to Tijuana just to avoid talking to me?
Only one way to find out.
- (chuckles)
- Look.
I also want to clarify one thing
- about that text.
"- No, no, no, please..."
"I would be doing those things to your mother, and not the other way around, because... no, look at me."
You got to look at me.
But evidence does.
"Ah,good."
"Abby,have you lifted the dna from the shovel handle yet?"
"You know,from the sweat we discovered on the handle."
"Oh.Yeah,uh,right."
I-I've got it running.
I'm ready to check it.I just need a sample.
"Well,then... test it against the saliva on this."
You're right.
I tried to cover up her murder.
But I didn'kill him.
That cheating bitch did.
"Boss,Mr. Carvell re admitted to ducky he buried the body."
"Oh,my god."
It was you?
Who else cleans up your messes?
I was watching the two of you from the window.
You watched us make love?
That's not what I'd call it.
Then what happened?
"-They had a fight,she hit him on the head,and she ran."
-Rick... that he's lying.
All I did was bury him.
"Well,I'm afraid you did a bit more than that."
Right.
I unburied him.
Sit down.
A reexamination of the conjunctival and facial tissu revealed petechial hemorrhages suggesting asphyxia.
"So I looked for atelectasis in his lungs, which results from shallow breathing due to aobstruction such as plastic."
And there it was.
Lance corporal finn was buried alive.
He was dead!
BROOKE:
"Oh, no."
He's tuning out.
That's the look he gives me when I try to tell him...
"Well, just about anything."
We don't have that problem.
"Jack thinks every other thing I say is ""great""!"
"No, no, no, he's got this, just stay focused, Jack."
...and that basic bitch had the nerve to change the margins on my profit-loss statements?
Mm-mmm.
"Amy, I need to talk to you."
"Look, I jumped into this without thinking it through, and that's on me, so..."
What are you trying to say?
[mouthing words]
"What I'm trying to say, Amy, is..."
What are you doing with your hands?
[mouthing words]
"I realize that I have a lot of growing up to do, and you and I aren't going to make it."
Are you breaking up with me?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
AMY:
Wow.
"I appreciate your honesty, but when I look at the balance sheet of our relationship, you're still kind of a jerk."
[phone camera clicks]
"""Kind of a jerk."""
"""Kind of a jerk!"""
"- That's two steps above ""monster."""
- Mm hmm.
I'm proud of you.
"Yeah, I keep this up, by Christmas I'll just be"
"""sort of unpleasant."""
It's Jimmy.
We've only got a few moments until they run into they're onto us again.
"Okay, just give me your arm."
"Okay, just relax."
Here it is.
Here it is.
Bingo!
This little fucker is how they've been tracking you.
Toodle-oo.
"In a few moments, your mechanical parts are gonna start shutting down."
Your friend Akan's got an important Russian connection named Slick Dimitry.
Slick handles all Akan's cops/guns/ real estate/ a lot of other shit.
This helpful dot on the map... is Slick's place.
"All you gotta do is break in there... kill him... open up his ribcage, take out his beating heart... and fucking eat it."
I'm kidding!
I'm kidding.
You don't have to fucking eat his heart.
"Under his heart is his charge pump, yeah?"
Bring that to me.
Use this and I'll contact you on this.
That has gotta be the gayest jacket I've ever seen.
(SCREAMS
Henry.
Akan's already started.
"If we don't stop him, he'll have his army in days or sooner."
"You're half machine, half pussy."
"Wait, wait."
"I can tell you something very important, about the man who sent you here."
"Oi, Henry."
I'm at this high-class establishment.
Follow the dot and then just knock on the knocker.
Get it?
"""Because you are really starting"
"""to make us elf people look very crazy."
"""And what you need to do"
"""is sit your ass in the corner,"
"""enjoy your goddamn cookies,"
"""and have a good life in this raggedy son of a bitch."
"""'Cause I got all the edibles a pimp could want to eat."
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
"Pimpin', pimpin'."""
All right.
I know there's a few people confused.
"Some people are confused like,"
"""What the hell is a Katt Williams?"
"What is that, a negro feline or something like that?"""
Have fun.
"Kanye West, man."
"That short man complex, man, that shit transcends species."
That's why you'll see a Chihuahua trying to fight Rottweiler for no reason.
I know when I talk about dogs some people get tight.
"""Don't talk about the baby."""
Baby?
"Ma'am, your poodle did not come out of your vagina."
I don't know what you talking about.
It's not a baby.
It's a dog.
You know what I'm saying?
"And y'all be abusing the hell out y'all dogs, and I'm gonna tell you how."
Putting them little outfits on them.
They don't wanna wear that shit.
"""But he's cold."
"He's cold."""
He's got fur.
We'll go there.
Hold on.
Hold on.
"How do I know once I give it to you, you won't just kill me?"
Why should I trust you?
Ohhh.
"Mr. Sodor, if you help me,"
"I promise you, I'll repay the favor."
I'm a man of my word.
"But, uh..."
I lack patience.
"And suddenly, I'm overwhelmed with trust."
Could you stop...
loading your gun for a second?
Stop loading.
Just stop loading.
Just want to make sure that I heard you correctly.
You're sending that psychopath here?
!
"Yeah, that's the whole idea."
"Mike goes in, steers him to the house."
"Jabbar comes here, attacks the place."
We call the cops on him.
W-why am I hearing about this part of the plan just now?
T-the part where my last remaining possession gets chopped up by machine-gun fire and then turned into a crime scene?
!
Because we knew you'd get all whiny on us.
Whiny?
!
"Listen -- the good news is, you don't have to part of the fireworks this time, okay?"
Fi's gonna take you up the road to a nice little motel.
You sit tight there.
- Saul shouldn't have said anything.
- No!
You do not get to blame Saul!
"He had enough faith in me, enough respect for me to be honest, which is more than I can say for you or Tommy or Kevin."
Were you never going to tell me?
You've had so much to cope with.
It just didn't seem to be the right time.
I can just see Tommy spearheading this whole brilliant idea.
- He's so like his father.
"- No, it was my idea."
- It was your idea?
- Yeah.
I was the one who thought that we should keep this information from you.
"Your father made you president of our family business, Sarah."
Not our family.
You taught me to put family first.
I was trying to.
"No, it is not."
You were trying to do what was easy for you.
You think it's been easy keeping this a secret?
No one asked you to!
There is no justification for this.
"- Oh, God."
What?
- Hey.
You ready for dinner?
- May I speak to Dan Silk?
- Talking to him.
"If you're going to make a living tarnishing people's reputations, you may want an unlisted number."
Thanks for the tip.
- Do I know you?
"- No, you do not."
Often get defamed.
But I'm a minister.
If get defamed my party will be finished.
Vishwas fired a shot.
If Shiv's questioned... then me and my son will be in trouble.
The election's around the corner.
The media cannot be trusted.
Why don't you understand this?
Let's take care of Shiv permanently.
Let's burn him and bury his body.
I want to be on the top touch the sky... and you're still busy burying people.
I want to be a hit in politics not be on someone's hit-list.
- Mr. Pradhan...
- Enough.
You won't move a muscle.
I'll take care of things now.
If anyone asks say that Shiv's still being investigated.
The dog will definitely die.
But someone else will kill him.
Get it.
Let's burn him and bury his body.
Someone else.
Boss.
The inspector's here...
To inquire about Bajrang.
Go on.
Go to the dispensary.
Otherwise even the rats at home will fall sick.
Welcome Inspector.
For the first time...
an inspector's surrounded by goons.
- Boss...
"Yeah, felt all of it."
I got my head turned inside out.
JIM:
Jesus.
"Them Indians down Texas way they may rob you, but they ain't gonna take your topknot."
JIM:
When was it?
"Goddamn it, will you quit that noise now, will you?"
Quit it.
FITZGERALD:
I'mfallingfurtherback fromHenryandthe boys onaccountof tendingtoyou.
"Got to get up the damn mountain, but winter keeps chasing us down."
If you ready to take the sacrament I can do that for you.
"What you holding to, Glass?"
You know it would be better if you were to take that last breath of yours now... for all of us.
Now you hung tough.
And that's something.
I'm begging you.
Them Ree are so close I can smell 'em.
"You can smell 'em, too."
You got to think of your boy.
All right?
'Cause you're gonna kill him.
You'll kill us all.
(MUTTERING)
I can muzzle you if you like.
Take away this suffering quick and easy.
No one ever has to know that you give up.
All you have to do is blink if you want me to do that.
(GRUNTING SOFTLY)
Save your boy and blink.
You just have to blink.
Are you coming with me or not?
Molech.
"Molech, do you want another drink?"
It's Evan.
No thanks.
Sorry about Dante.
Gene.
They figure out what killed him?
What does it matter?
"He's dead, right?"
There have been people around here asking questions.
"You haven't said anything, have you?"
Of course not.
Good boy!
No thanks
I'm just trying to make you feel better.
"Yeah, well, it didn't do much for Gene."
You don't think this is what killed him?
He was doing a lot.
Yeah and he was sleeping it off in an alley.
Who knows what could have happened to him.
"Hey, I know how we can make each other feel better."
I have a new piercing.
Where are you?
There's evidence to indicate that Gene Hansen died of anaphylactic shock.
The pathologist found an unknown substance in his bloodstream.
"Yeah, an unknown substance."
I need you to be straight with me.
Are you selling drugs here?
I'm not even going to dignify that with a response.
"Coreen, tell her I'm not selling drugs."
"You have to tell her, whichever way it is."
"(normal voice) I don't think he knows that movie, honey."
"Mrs. Dunphy, you're trying to seduce me."
"Okay, let's just give him the gift, all right?"
"Okay, but first, gather around, everybody!"
Riddle me this...
"What has two hands, is wound tight, and has a lot of ticks?"
Alex?
- (laughs)
"- Good guess, but no."
"This was made in Switzerland, not in the Disneyland Hotel."
Awesome!
A watch!
We wanted to give it to you early so you could wear it to graduation today.
Yeah.
It's shockproof.
"Oh, good."
You can show it your grades.
- I love it.
- What time is it?
(voice breaking) Time for my little man to go out in the world and make his mark
- like the tiny trouper he used to be.
- (sighs)
Hold on.
I'll be right back.
"I remember when he was so small, we'd give him a bath in the sink."
Here we go.
"Dad, we really got to talk about the crying."
"When we graduated, you were a mess, and it was humiliating."
Showing emotion is part of being a sexy modern man.
Ask anyone who was raised on Alan Alda.
I don't think we have to worry about him going anywhere anytime soon.
He just installed a mini fridge and a hammock in his room.
All of 'em.
"Jack Donaghy, General Electric, George Bush, Karl Robe."
"Karl Robe, you say?"
"Affirmative action was designed to keep women and minorities in competition with each other, to distract us while white dudes inject AIDS into our chicken nuggets."
That's a metaphor.
Sure.
You should tell that to U S Weekly.
"Hey, Lemon, you like karaoke?"
I know a joint.
"No, I've got to wrap up this lunch meeting, Tracy."
[Horn honking]
I'll take you.
I'll take you.
I just got to make a quick stop first.
[Cheers and applause]
LIZ:
You know what?
"When people say they need to make a quick stop, they usually mean at the bank or at the store."
"No, thank you."
You know what?
This is for computer classes.
"You know why I should do this TV show, Lemon?"
I really don't.
To get you rich.
"'Cause you know if I'm on that TV show, it's gonna blow up."
How do you know I'm not rich?
Your teeth.
"You got to think like these strippers, Lemon."
They know the window of opportunity is only open for a moment.
"You got to get in while you're young, get the money, and get out."
"Yeah, well, I'm not a sex worker, Tracy."
I don't have sex for a living.
"- If he keeps giving us hundred dollars bills,"
- he can have all the vanilla milkshake he want!
- Ow!
I just don't understand why we have to do any of this.
"Well, if you want him to sign off, these are his terms."
"Yes, but it makes no sense."
It's not like she's asking him for anything.
"Sit down, love."
"So, Callie, we heard back from Robert Quinn's lawyer."
- Ok.
"- And he won't sign anything until there's a DNA test, to prove that you're his daughter."
So...
I seriously can't handle sharing the gym with the wrestlers anymore.
- The gym smells like feet.
"- Well, that's appetizing."
And all the boys ever do is stare at us.
Pervs.
"Well, it's not awesome for me either, hearing guys talk about how hot my sister is."
- Which guys?
"- Besides, I see the dance team checking us out too."
"That Hayley girl, can't take her eyes off me."
"Oh, yeah?"
"Hayley, the one with the college boyfriend Hayley?"
She dates boys in college?
None of the girls on the dance team date boys in high school.
- Oh.
We'll see about that.
- Better not let Emma hear you.
"Please, I can handle Emma."
What?
I pretty sure no one handles Emma but Emma.
"Hey, Brandon!"
"What God has joined together, let no man pull asunder."
What are you doing here?
We were to meet at the hotel.
I changed my mind.
I've always liked weddings.
Weren't you to see your sister before the fight?
"I called her, she'll be at the hotel."
I had to promise we'd have supper at her bar tonight.
Whatever you say.
"A lovely ceremony, isn't it?"
Beautiful.
Ididn't think she was so young.
I guess you came because you didn't trust me.
I came because we can't go another day without talking.
You needn't worry.
It's over with Angela.
I've got proof.
During the ceremony I didn't cry.
But you did.
That's true.
And you needn't.
Don't you believe me?
It isn't that.
"It took me ten years to get over it, but I swear it's over."
Marco...
"Believe me, it's over."
Angela and I traveled a lot.
"The excuse was to write a travel guide on some exotic place, but really it was to keep her away from drugs, to escape from Madrid."
Life in Madrid was hell.
Our relationship only worked when we got away.
"After trying for five years and seven travel guides,"
"I brought her here to Lucena, to her parents."
"- Unless Mary helps him, of course."
- Of course.
"Rotten for you, Christine."
I got the fright of my life.
Did you see him come after me?
"Writers can do fine things but when they crack up, they're a menace."
"Here, dry your tears."
An emergency.
"Sit down here, I'll phone you a cab."
I'll come back and tell you what Gerard said about you.
- Feeling sad?
- Yes.
Where do you live?
"Let me take you home, I'm going that way."
"- No, they're getting me a cab."
- That'll take ages.
Come on.
- You wind surf?
Any good at it?
"- Yes, out at sea and in the harbor."
- Among the big tankers.
- lsn't that dangerous?
It's child's play.
Want me to teach you?
"No, it's not my sort of thing, but I'll come and film you some time."
"Oh, any time."
"1938, when Sino-Japanese War was like a raging fire."
"And the countries were fighting each other,"
"Atomic fission was first tested by German Scientists, which would lead to the world's destruction."
"If this was exploited by Hitler,"
The entire human race will be annihilated.
"Well, with a diagnosis like mine, the goal is to keep the patient alive long enough for some new miracle drug to appear."
Daddy.
"Yes, my man?"
I want to play with you.
Okay.
"Well, I want to play with you, too."
Let's do it.
Oh.
Dad.
What's happening?
Take me back to the Cube.
The E.R. stopped the bleeding.
He's resting comfortably in his room.
What happened?
"Nose and mouth bleeds are common side effects of chemotherapy, but they can lower his platelet count, so your dad may need a platelet infusion."
That's... all it is?
Mm-hmm.
They'll run some tests to be sure.
"All right, come on."
Show me what you got.
Wait for it.
- There it is.
"- Oh, touchdown!"
- Right on cue.
"- No, no, no, what am I missing?"
"Spike in cerebral blood flow in his precuneus area, also known as ""the God spot."""
It's one of the several areas of the brain linked to spirituality.
"You see, as Jacob listens to music, his right brain is shutting down because he's entering a trance state."
"So, why is this happening to a man who's never been spiritual before?"
"- I don't know, but look at that."
- Mm.
"Oh, wow."
"Well, if I'm afraid, I'll call on you, you little slut."
Small since when?
I'm plenty grown up!
"More than is good for you, right?"
Not at all!
But I'm already outgrowing the clothes...
Everyone can tell that.
See for yourself!
Have a look.
"Well, what's already there..."
Don't be so sure.
- If you've set yourself up here...
"- Stop it, ok?"
"Can I come visit then, Bruno?"
This is no children's playground!
Can I have a drag?
Why are you shaking like that?
Give it back!
Just what I'd need - have people say that I seduced a minor into smoking.
Come over here...
What do you want?
Come here already!
It's my sister!
Take care that you're not caught here!
Maybe one could stretch a few clothes lines from pillar to pillar?
Or across here...
"Or at right angles so that the whole thing would get more class, become slightly more stylish."
So that things are not hanging around here like... in a pawnshop.
There are more 100 valuable costumes here.
He wants to unpack his stuff.
All the baskets?
Termination!
"No, mom."
Close but it's not what you think.
What?
"What are you talking about, marcus?"
Relax.
I'm talking about monica.
- Oh.
- She's doing really well.
"Yeah, and she's like a new person next to how"
She was when she went in.
And she's coming home soon.
"Oh, that's wonderful news."
I can't wait to see her.
"Yeah, and the good news is today is her pre-Release evaluation."
"So say a prayer that they feel she's ready to come home,"
Because i miss her.
And monica also had some news
"She wanted to share with all of us,"
But she wouldn't tell me what it was.
"Oh, that's wonderful, marcus."
Yeah.
I wanted to share the news with regina.
"I was hoping that it would make her feel better about monica and things,"
But i guess it's not gonna happen today.
I know this is not the right time for her.
"Well, i wouldn't get my hopes up if i were you."
She does have a lot of feelings
That she has to deal with about monica.
And we won't even talk about this new mess.
I know it's been hard for regina
"When it comes to dealing with monica and this situation,"
But i also know she loves her daughter very much.
Shopping with Sophie is like when I worked in a Thai massage parlor.
We are going down.
Not if we go before Sophie and hide every ugly bridesmaid's dress that Sophie would like.
"If she can't see them, she can't make us wear them."
How did you come up with that so fast?
It's the same plan I used in 2010 when I was a bridesmaid for Chelsea Clinton.
Bad dress and then her father followed me into the coat room.
"Oh, wow."
Look at this place.
It reminds me of that movie.
- Bridesmaids?
"- No, Nightmare on Elm Street."
"I don't know what you're worried about, Caroline."
I think they're all quite lovely.
"Nash, please."
You're a poor person from Ireland.
I'll ask your opinion when I need to know where to go to get free leg braces.
"You were right, Max."
"She can be a real ""B"" sometimes."
"I'm sorry, but I don't even know why he's here."
Bonin' O'Brien here... is gonna distract the sales lady while we hide the ugly dresses.
"Hello, ladies."
Same plan.
Who's the lucky bride?
"Or should I say, who's the lucky cradle robber?"
Don't mind me.
It's just my crazy sense of humor.
"Oh, the ladies here love it."
"The call me ""Crazy Carl."""
"[raspy voice] ""Did you hear what Crazy Carl said?"""
They just love it.
I'm Caroline.
So is there an echo in here?
Why him?
Because he's a hero!
So?
"Well, how do you know he's a hero, if he doesn't do anything heroic?"
"Well, he's called Johnnie."
Are you trying to put up a fight with me Mrs.Cole?
Johnnie can't go in the water!
He's injured.
Badly injured.
Manly slash on the biceps for Christ sake!
He's...he's not gonna be leaking spleen through his trousers.
"""Mrs.Rosen Lily story"" and you won't let them do anything."
Then go to Dunkirk.
And Johnnie pirates them home.
They are girls!
Here girls don't want to be the hero.
They want to have the hero.
They want to have by him!
Huh?
Tom?
Cab.
"And back in there if Viper just even gets her nose through the office door while we are out, you are sacked!"
"And don't think I won't know, I can smell her shaving cream on the wind."
Anything else?
"Since you're so keen to flex your femininity, you can tidy up."
I heard furniture.
"Angels of the sea, across the waves, two to Dunkirk, three to Dunkirk, Dunkirk O'bust, busts Dunkirk."
"Somewhere in the world, there is bullet with that man's name on."
Why hasn't he been called up?
Apart from Parfitt's too old.
"But, Buckley?"
"What's wrong, you're not getting in?"
Looks like I have to go in his car.
"Don't eat bread Mi Jin, or you may trigger your allergies!"
Please eat your meals when you are at Sunshine Welfare!
Sunshine Welfare?
Why are you telling her to not eat that?
She is allergic to flour.
"If she eats foods containing flour, she'll have reactions."
This time the infection got into her trachea which is making her show signs of asthma.
It is extremely dangerous.
"Because she's on welfare, she doesn't have to worry about the hospital fees."
Welfare?
They're not on it.
"I don't have a lot of time, so let's hurry."
They're not on welfare.
I think the nurse was misinformed.
Do you know those children?
They live in the basement of my apartment building.
"It's them, please stop the car."
What's wrong?
"Hey, you were told to not eat food having flour."
Why are you still eating that?
Hey!
What are you doing?
Chase after them!
Why do I have to chase them?
Hurry!
Didn't you both hear that she can't eat bread?
Are you okay?
Did you get hurt?
Go.
Are you all right?
Didn't I run fast?
That's fine.
"But you have the plates, don't you?"
"Yes, the plates are with me."
Kania is in for some complications.
Baba and Nawab have burnt down our godown.
That's destiny.
"If you say, I will blow apart both of them."
You are my younger brother.
I can sacrifice several such godowns in your name.
- l won't involve you in this fight.
- Then would we sit quietly?
Enjoy yourselves.
I am there to look after the business. I am your elder brother.
Nawab and Baba are the backbone of Uncle.
Everybody knows.
Only I know what the weakness of Uncle is!
Do you know what Uncle's choice is?
"He likes gold, Mona, and Mona along with gold!"
Please speak to Baba and Nawab about me.
Let me think it over.
I am your nephew.
I am your blood.
"By working as an ordinary driver in your business not just me, even you are insulted."
Please speak to Baba and Nawab about me.
I am constantly worried that because of your foolishness the two of them shouldn't have to face trouble.
What did I do to make such a thing happen?
So you have come?
"These are my two arms, my two tigers..."
Baba and Nawab!
What's the matter?
Why are you so sullen?
"You play my wife, you bastard, I'll kill you and all of you..."
Do you have permission to have this Noid mutated?
Delicious breast milk for your cookies!
"It's no noid, it's Sara."
"Do not waste it, I'm too old for the way I like it."
- I know where the rebel Noids are.
- Where are they!
"I traded with them, thinking I would trade enough."
Trade with fugitive humanoids?
Maybe you get only 30 years.
"And old Sara, she should be more than happy to return to the local palaces of pleasure."
"""And give milk... for cookies!"""
- It's okay!
I'll help you!
We have to wait for them at the meeting place.
They always arrive at eight.
There are only a few kilometers.
"Okay, biscuit."
Daddy's here now.
Is Dad.
I will protect you.
"Have you no manners, son of a bitch?"
- Do you have any more weapons?
- Pissing ice balls on the icebergs?
"This is all my team, long before your time."
"Sergeant Ulysses H. Cage, Spartan-3."
Retired after 30 years of service in the field.
Be my butt.
The Spartans do not retreat.
They die like a hero.
Or they pee like cowards.
Put this piece of gun away and I'll show you exactly how cowardly I am.
Lift it up.
Dump it back there.
Stop!
You put Butterscotch Betty down.
"Oh, we were just looking for a price tag."
I know what's going on here.
You're hiding the good dresses to make sure no one else can get them at our annual half-off sale tomorrow.
"Yeah, that's what we're doing."
We're hiding the good dresses.
"In fact, I just caught another Sneaky Sue."
"Oh, I'm Sophie."
"Oh, wow, wow, wow."
"Oh, look at the color."
That's not color.
That's radiation.
That dress is a one of a kind.
Meaning there's only one?
"No, we have two."
And I have two bridesmaids!
I love it when life works out perfect like this.
[indistinct chatter]
"(Public address announcement) Ladies, our half off sale will begin in a minute."
Look at this place.
There are more desperate women crammed in here than the splash zone at a Kenny Chesney concert.
I know.
It's like Black Friday at Walmart
"And like Black Friday, hopefully someone will trample me."
"Cause thanks to these dresses, my life is over."
"Max, did you hear me?"
My life is over.
You said that when the Chinese food place forgot the duck sauce.
"Well, I'm sorry, but I had a whole other scenario planned for my return to The Times."
All of my internal organs are women.
"Listen, I have an early surprise birthday present for you."
"- When is your birthday, by the way?"
- In about six months.
Then this is very early.
You know the director Jim Jarmusch...
"Down by Law, Broken Flowers?"
"- Yeah, I love his movies."
"- Well, I saw Jarmusch the other night."
"He has very good hair, just..."
"Anyway, he wants to meet with you, give you a script to read."
- Why does he want me to read?
- He loves your first novel and he wants you to do a revision of one of his screenplays.
You're gonna meet him at a film society party tomorrow sometime and I've set the whole thing up for you.
I don't know.
I really should be working on my book.
"And look, I don't know how to write screenplays."
You need a computer program or something.
- It's crazy.
- Don't be a milquetoast.
This is a very big opportunity for you.
It could be a life changer.
Can one screenplay really change a life?
Sometimes.
Do I want my life to change?
"Most people do, Jonathan."
"Oh, shit, there's Antrem and Priscilla."
Don't turn around.
Don't draw attention.
Just sit...
Just sit there.
Who are they?
Cripes.
You think he got enough film?
Hmm.
WOMAN:
What?
Do I even want to know?
When did we knock over the coat rack?
Maybe it was that night we played drunk charades.
You remember.
"No, he doesn't remember 'cause he passed out on the couch."
"Well, I guess this explains the green light we see over here sometimes."
"Yeah, but why is this thing bolted to the ﬂoor?"
"I don't know, but I don't like it."
I don't like the sound it's making either.
"Uh, or how about the half-naked photos of me on the wall?"
That's the one thing I do like about this situation.
(SIGHS)
I knew something wasn't right about that old man.
"Hi, Mr. Kendall, this is Finn from Sycamore Apartments."
I'm calling you back about Mr. Bezzerides.
"If you can please ring me when you get a chance, that would be great."
Thank you.
What did the landlord say?
I just left a voice mail.
Okay.
I'm off to work.
"I counted the cookies, so if any go missing, there will be murder in this apartment."
I'll guard 'em.
"Well, who's going to guard 'em from you?"
(GASPS)
(SCOFFS) it's a perfect match.
It's got to be a coincidence.
Friends?
Ha!
- You are fatally sweet.
- Hm.
I wonder if George will be there.
She has the most alarming way of turning up everywhere I go.
I'm beginning to find it unnerving.
She has a desperate purpose.
What do you mean?
A while ago she was out drinking and gambling... she leads a rough life... and she boasted that...
Let's not talk about it.
I fear I am about to commit a tremendous faux pas.
"Socially she is too bizarre, but somehow I find her very compelling."
I wonder if she is different when alone.
She boasted that you are to be her next lover.
Alfred was there.
He's still the love of her life.
He put money on it you wouldn't be seduced.
"Yes, they made you the object of a bet."
"Well, you know she's eternally in need of money."
Here we are.
You have the most priceless expression on your face.
There's Mallefille.
We can be sure George is here.
He's still following her like a tail.
"Darling, it's so good to see you."
- I didn't know you'd be here.
- I didn't either.
(CHATTER AND LAUGHTER)
Chopin hates my paintings.
No.
"Dear friend, I am just a musician."
"Let me see, let me see."
"Ah, the groaning board, the teeming table, the endless variety of God's bounty."
"Cheffing is a truly perfect art, far above mere painting or sculpture."
You can't eat a sheet of canvas or a lump of rock.
I don't know.
You could if you were drunk and had enough ketchup.
"- Morning, Richie."
- Do my senses deceive me?
Has Eddie Catflap emerged from the arms of Morpheus or perhaps an elephant has blown off?
No.
Right first time.
"It is I, smelly Eddie."
To whiff him is to love him.
"Ready for anything, as long as it's alcoholic."
"- Morning, Richie."
- Where's my shopping list?
Gas mask.
"Now then, shall we have seven courses or eight?"
Don't want do look ostentatious.
But don't want to look like a bloody pauper.
Better make it 12.
We could be like the Romans and throw up between courses.
Why should they get the credit for that idea?
I've been doing it for years.
"Morning, Richie."
"Twelve gas masks, clothes peg for nose, smelling salts and a ticket to Australia to get away from Eddie's whiff."
"- I said, morning, Richie!"
- Ah!
"I got you, then, didn't I?"
I got you.
"Morning, Eddie."
I trust you slept well?
He is not a man.
He is a woman.
He's all emotion and refinement.
He has very few defences.
You must win him as a man wins a woman.
"If anyone can do it, you can, George."
This is enlightening.
Tell me more.
How does a man pursue a woman?
"He flings himself at her feet, follows her everywhere."
"Wherever she turns, he is there, pouring into her ear only what she most wants to hear."
"His passion frightens her, but a woman will always bend toward a strong man, just as the vine stretches toward the wall."
A woman is always on the point of abandoning herself anyhow.
It only takes one firm push.
You are sublime!
A true friend.
Ah!
Yes.
Those are marvellous.
Yes.
This is from...
George Sand.
Thank you.
"And I want something with a much thinner, narrower line."
"Yes, that is good, I think."
"In fact, you could make this even more..."
"No, I don't want this."
"Take it off, please."
You are so good to escort me tonight.
People shun me unless I am on the arm of someone respectable.
I do not understand your concern.
You will find nothing but friends at Eugene's.
We must sink them!
Only Commander Yu Jong can issue such orders.
It will be too late if we wait for Yu Jong's orders!
"If they get away, you will be killed as well!"
Admiral Yi does not have the right of command.
He is not to take independent action.
That is the order of the King!
"Practice restraint, Admiral."
"Admiral, they have passed the big island!"
"If we don't act now, it will be too late!"
Very well.
I'll will go!
And I will assume full responsibility!
No one is to take hostile action!
What?
"Admiral, give me your command!"
Are you going to let it end like this?
Do not take action.
Your life and your men's lives are at stake.
"Admiral, we're running out of time!"
"If they pass Hando Island, they will be out of our reach."
It is high treason!
Admiral!
Go after them!
What happened?
They launched the ships.
Yi Soon-shin has taken action!
How dare he!
After them!
Don't let them get away!
Full speed ahead!
Don't let them get away!
Hey.
- Hey.
"- Any luck with the sponsor, hunt?"
Nobody's made a donation since Sonny Newman was alive.
"Check this out, bro."
They're back in town.
Been here a while I guess.
They came into the copy shop to design this for some kind of business that they run.
But get this.
"Back in 2002, they won the lottery."
Brought back the Chiefs for one season and then became these big time poker players.
- So are you thinking...
- They lived here.
They played hockey.
They got lots of cash.
"So when the Chiefs folded, we took our lottery money and we went gambling."
"Roulette, dice, poker, Vegas, Atlantic City."
We were high rollers.
"But it was an empty life, you know."
"Babes, booze, bar fights."
"Our wives left us, took our kids."
You guys have kids?
"- Yeah, we got three of them."
"- Yeah, one each."
"Yeah, the judge said we weren't good role models."
Said we have to find peace and balance.
"That night during wrestling, I saw a TV ad for Peace and Balance."
- So we bought a franchise.
- Zenovation.
- So how's business?
- Sucks.
- Real bad.
- Mm...
"Not a big chance, no."
"- Sarah, please."
In the name of all that's holy.
I am the one who bought you your first bra.
I'm not above playing the guilt card.
"Sorry, Mom."
- Who'd you tell?
"- Come on, Mom!"
You spent a night in jail for smoking pot.
This family should have a Bat-Signal for things that good.
Don't worry about it.
"If I were you, I would be trying to live great stories."
You've had too much responsibility for too long.
Yeah.
I know.
Being good for this family has been my sole purpose of existence for as long as I can remember.
I don't know.
"Maybe it's the residual cannabis talking, but what is the meaning of life supposed to be the rest of my life?"
To enjoy it.
However you want.
"Mom, you don't have to worry about being good."
You should just be worried about having fun.
You might want to draw the line at things that get you arrested.
Yeah.
"Well, if it's all right with you,"
I am gonna take a shower for about an hour.
- Here.
- Thank you for picking me up.
"Of course, Mom."
I know you'd do the same for me.
Sorry.
And why do we care if he's a deserter?
We've already talked about this.
- Hi guys.
"- Welcome, bro."
Don't call me bro.
We are now considered to be on the same team.
I'll go and think over this 5 strangers on the team business.
Enjoy your work!
What work?
"- Good morning, Uncle Metin."
- Good morning.
Can I borrow your lighter?
Perfect timing.
"Hey, we won't bring the subject up right away."
Okay?
We aren't going to mention anything about cheating or stealing.
I know the guy.
He'll start acting like a brother and will start lecturing us.
"First, we're going to go through the method of giving him a hard time."
Great.
We'll give him such a hard time that he will understand what...
- we have been through.
- Wait a minute.
Where are we going?
The road that leads to success.
Really?
"So, is this the road to success?"
We're the only ones walking this road.
Doesn't anyone know about it?
Exactly.
"See, these are your rivals."
Go and get your application form right away.
- Can't you just do what I say?
"- Of course, dear Anna."
Don't I always do what you want?
"Well, just get going..."
"Morning, Mrs Ziemann."
Is everything fine?
"Selma, you shouldn't place the child here in the fumes."
It's so unhealthy.
"Outside it's too cold, in the stairwell too draughty, and here it's too fumy!"
Where shall I take the little mite?
"Well, maybe you can make yourself useful at least!"
"Come, help Mrs Ziemann with the basket."
I need to lie down for a bit.
"Are you not feeling well, Mrs John?"
"Oh, Mr Hassenreuter, it's the usual, you know..."
The child is coughing!
It comes from smoking.
"Mother smokes all day and because the child coughs, she cannot sleep."
and I'm fed up with it all.
That's tragic!
It makes one ask oneself who the real mother is.
"Well put, Mr Hassenreuter, and so true!"
Sometimes it seems to me as if I gave birth to it myself.
"Are you looking for me, Anna?"
"Man, did you give me a fright, Bruno!"
Where have you been?
Upstairs.
What are you doing here?
As if I didn't suspect that we'd need rat poison again.
I've just brought some from the drugstore.
You lay it out tomorrow so we'll get rid of that plague.
"Using the Lisol, you mop up here."
"Hey, I need your help."
We need to go over to the medical center.
Is everyone in there?
Yeah.
We're just waiting for you.
How is it going out there?
They took Talbot's farm.
How many men?
I'd say 60... 70.
That's probably just an advance team.
I would imagine they got more than that up the road in reserve.
Constantino has us outnumbered and outgunned.
"If we split our force, and try to defend each one of these farms, he's going to overwhelm us."
So what are you saying?
I'm saying we don't split up.
"We choose a place to stand together, deliver a good, hard counterpunch."
"Let them know that, if they intend to take from us, it's going to cost them dearly."
How?
"Well, right here."
Stanley Richmond's farm.
"It's the last place before this road divides, and they start taking ground faster than we can keep up."
Plus which it's the highest point in the whole area.
There's where we make our stand.
Deputy Perkins just radioed back.
The Talbot farm is secured.
Let's go get the rest of them.
Let's go!
This one's alive.

"Grandpa, you're drunk."
There you--go.
[Spits out drink]
Warm.
You can't do anything right.
- Help me up.
- Where are you gonna go?
"- Shut up, nurse!"
- And don't bump it.
Fat bitch.
Why do you put up with that guy?
I've had it.
"Arthur was famous for two things, bad wigs and carrying a gun."
You've owed me money for 30 years!
Musicians!
Ah!
They're the scum of the earth.
"He raised his palsied hand, and took aim."
"Every one of you, you'll all die!"
Arthur!
"Put the gun down, Arthur!"
I'm the genius.
I made you!
[Screaming]
"By him shooting down at his own bottle, he hit the weakest part of the bottle, which is where the valve is connected, 'cause there's a hole in the bottle."
"That would've forced the valve up, the bottle would've opened up like a--a flower, instantly, blown all the oxygen out of it."
"It would have been a catastrophic, uh, explosion, and he was as close as you can get to it, so it would've taken him out."
Who are you?
Arthur screwed everyone he ever worked with.
I'm the genius!
I made you!
[Screaming]
"But in the end, he gave Jerry and the Atrics an ending to their song."
"- Yo, Graff."
Why don't you come driving with us tonight?
That would be exciting.
If I were in a coma.
You'll be excited.
Later.
- l could have handled that.
- Yeah.
You're doing great.
"No, no. I'm asking a particular question. ls it fair?"
- What does fair have to do with it?
- Fair has to do with what?
Anybody?
Fair has to do with the right to come to school...
"and be able to do your work, and not be terrified."
Not have your heart beating fast.
Not jump every time there is a loud noise.
The right to come in and be left alone.
No?
Maybe not everybody is left alone anyway.
Meaning what?
"You don't know what goes on around here, okay?"
Maybe some people have guns to protect yourself.
"Maybe some people who have guns are like victims, too."
And they're like forced to carry.
You think kids with guns are like gangsters or dealers.
Your saying that if someone is threatened it's okay for them to carry...
a gun in school?
You don't think the school authorities can protect them?
"Man, you don't know what goes on around here."
Yes. lf l was--
"Say I was threatened, and I'm not saying that I am..."
What are you talking about?
Welovethisidea.
"No,  you love this idea, and you love it so much that you made me love it, too."
How many people do you know that would actually pay money to party on The Mystery Machine?
A lot of people.
"There's Tom, my co-worker Sam-- he loves this idea."
"And, uh..."
Crap.
I'm an idiot.
Oh.
"No, you're not."
Come on.
Just because this idea isn't great doesn't mean the next one's not gonna be.
I believe in you.
Oh.
"Oh, now we're out of wine."
I don't want to go all the way to the store to get it.
Why can't wine just appear whenever you want it to?
- Bye.
- Where are you going?
"Uh, I just want to go look into something."
But I'll catch up with you later-- maybe when you're done sucking that cork.
Shut up.
I don't do that.
"[ Door opens, closes ]"
"Dang, sad pitt."
Why the long face?
I was dropping mad knowledge on these shorties till this wangsta scrub came in and ganked my crew.
"Oh, I was helping out with a children's music class till another teacher came in and took my spot."
"I mean, me and the kids were having so much fun-- you know, really connecting."
And then this guy just came in and took over.
I feel you.
Far too much flogging.
There was a man killed.
- Under punishment?
"- Yes, sir."
I can deal with Mr. Scott-Padget.
"Maybe, sir."
Do you know what happened to the Beedle's captain?
The lordships of the Admiralty broke him and his two previous captains.
Influence?
"When somebody of enormous power has a mistress and that mistress has a son, the son has great influence at his back."
- I see.
- He's a most brilliant young officer.
A future Drake with a vicious streak and a silver spoon.
"Sir, it could be his making."
Good evening.
Can I offer you some Madeira?
- Yes.
- I'll be going.
"Thank you, Mr. Goss."
Would you like to know our orders?
"We join the fleet at Corsica, report to Admiral Jarvis."
Convoy duty.
"Orders say ""with all possible dispatch."""
"We'll not put in at Gibraltar, but you'll have time to train."
I hope so.
I'd like to practice gunnery next week.
Good.
I know how hard it is working up a green crew but I'd like you to go easier on them.
"The first few weeks, we use methods none of us like."
- You're questioning me.
- I haven't said so.
I know the value of discipline.
Oh.
"Well, I-I guess we might have a minute."
Uh... is there...
anything you'd like to share with the students?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I got somethin'."
"They tell you you gotta learn your a-b-c's, but what they don't tell you is, you gotta learn them backwards while balancing on one foot with a flashlight in your face while some guy you went to high school with"
calls you a punk on account of he became a cop and you swerved a little and hit a fire hydrant.
Ha!
(Bell rings) Oh!
Look at that.
Time for lunch.
"Let's please form a line, uh, by the door."
Go!
(Children speaking indistinctly)
"Hey, come on."
I'll take you to lunch.
"Uh, I don't know."
I think I'm supposed to tell the principal if I leave the school.
"No, we don't need to bother the principal."
"You know, they don't want some stranger coming in, saying he's gonna take a small child. (Chuckles)"
Hmm.
"Bye, guys."
Gotta go.
Taking aunt Ginny to the movies.
"Of course, she calls it ""The Picture Show."""
(Laughs) (Chuckles)
(Door opens and closes) Isn't it nice how good mom is to the aunts?
(Scoffs and chuckles)
What?
You cannot be that big of an idiot.
You really have no idea where mom's going?
"Well, call me when you're free."
What are you doing?
I finally decided to get my act together.
"Wait, this isn't about your audition tape for So You Think You Can Dance."
"No, not that act."
"Ooh, although I did watch that tape the other day and I don't think I can dance..."
I can dance.
I have decided to get organized.
"You know how I'm always writing little reminders to myself on little scraps of paper, and then nothing ever gets done?"
"Well, from now on, everything I have to do is going on this board."
"Come on, help me."
- This one has gum in it.
- All right.
"Well, then skip it, give me another one."
"""Get dry erase board."""
Huh.
"What do I do, should I write it down then cross it out?"
"God, I don't know."
This has never happened before.
"Okay, give me another one."
What's a witch detective?
"Oh, that's my idea for a TV show."
"- Oh, that's really good."
- Yeah.
"All right, um, oh, here."
Grandparents' Day-- this Friday.
Write that down.
What's Grandparents' Day?
"Oh, it's another way Ritchie's school has of getting money."
"They invite all the grandparents for a pancake breakfast, and try to get them to include Westbridge into their wills."
"Wait... uh, Mom and Dad are coming here this weekend?"
You can't just spring this on me.
"Well, we still have power."
"Yeah, well, let's work quickly, Mr. Palmer, while we still can."
Abby said our dead fake air marshal's name is Norman Dopps.
Norman.
"There's a name, huh?"
"Well, the Normans were Vikings."
They settled on part of the coast of France.
"Yes, on what one day would become known as Normandy."
"See, now, that history is great, but I just couldn't do it to the little guy."
Norman is a bit too Psycho- ish.
You could always shorten it to Norm.
Norm?
Norm!
"Nah, see, I'd have to fight the urge to give the kid a beer."
Oh.
Here we go.
Ah.
Murder on the lavatory.
Bishop sent these in the second e-mail.
"Yeah, it's quite a... nasty and narrow puncture wound."
"From a plastic knife, or something that could get past security?"
"No, no, no, no, no."
"Something stronger, to pierce the rib cage."
A nylon dagger.
"Or carbon fiber, perhaps."
"And based on the incision, it seems to have been twisted, twisted on entry."
For maximum damage.
"Mm, clearly, an expert kill."
How soon till we get these up to Jethro?
Oh...
I can bring them on my tablet.
Do you know the meaning of the name Jethro?
How's he holding up?
Same as he always was.
"They wanna lock him up, he says, ""Yes, sir, lock me up. """
"They wanna put him on trial, he says, ""Yes, sir, put me on trial. """
He'd help tie the noose if they asked him to.
He's your father.
What's the matter with you?
When I was about 7 years old...
... ourownersdecidedtosell him and us kids away from our mother.
Put us on a wagon and we ended up going to Alabama.
She stayed behind in Georgia.
"And after a while, he had told me that she died."
"Now, I was just a little boy at the time, but all that time..."
... Iwaitedforhim tofind away  to keep our mother with us...
... oruswithher .
But he never said one word.
He didn't do anything.
"He didn't argue, he didn't even beg."
He didn't put up one damn ounce of fight to keep our family together.
Harsh.
He should have done something.
What are you doing with all that string?
Keeping my mind busy.
What's a white lady doing in jail?
My own son locked me up.
Sometimes they don't rightly appreciate what you do for them.
Truer words were never spoken.
[EZRA chuckling ]
"Well, well."
"My, my."
"It's a touch baroque, but I like what you've done with the place."
-What do you want?
Thank you.
Pushing more dye.
"Oh yeah, there we go."
Look at the shape there.
All squished up like a Takotsubo vase.
like a Takotsubo vase.
"See that, that's textbook."
"Um, Nik..."
"What you got baby, you got a broken heart."
"- Oh Sam, don't..."
"- No, baby."
"No, I'm serious, baby."
You have stress cardiomyopathy.
"Yeah, it's also called broken heart syndrome."
"It's associated with sudden, intense emotional or physical stress."
The muscles around your heart took such a beating when you got the news about Stephanie that they're just having a hard time keeping up now.
You really do have a broken heart.
But we can treat this.
"I can't lie to you, we've got to go through this entire night incident-free."
"If we can do that, you're gonna be fine."
Hey!
We need a doctor!
What the hell happened?
Kid started complaining of a sore throat in the car.
"- Started wheezing, choking..."
- Let's get him on the bed.
Pike!
No verbal or motor responses.
What the hell is...
That's bruising around his neck!
Looks fresh.
Sats at 90 and falling.
"All right, off to bed."
It's late.
Smells like a giant jock strap.
Maybe 30 years ago it would've been fine.
"Oh, my Lord."
"Okay listen, honey, try not to touch anything or breathe deeply."
There he is.
Should have worn a hazmat suit.
Those are some extremely nice skates for rentals.
We don't open till 10:00.
"You're Shayne Baker, right?"
Girl's league MVP?
I hear you're pretty good.
"What do you say, maybe sometime, you and me, we could go scrimmage."
I am good for girl's league.
Maybe you should just go scrimmage yourself.
Okay.
It's a very generous offer!
More than this place is worth.
This ice has decades of history for the town.
I'm not going to just sell it off because you wanna put some office building here.
"Well, actually, I was thinking more of a boutique mall and day-spa."
"Rick, history only matters if people care, and no one does around here any more."
This town belongs to me.
"And one way or another this ancient scrap heap you call an ice rink will be mine, too."
So think about my offer.
"Let's go, Kain."
Stay away from her.
"- Now, Kain!"
- All right.
"Well, Dad?"
- I said no.
- Lauren.
"- Oh, my God."
Don't get me started on that girl.
How could you be so cold and frigid?
- She's like a freaking speculum.
- She's here.
"Hi, Kenzi."
Hey.
"You know, as your doctor I should recommend against excessive intoxication."
Who's drunk?
"Well, we don't know the effects of cocktails on your abilities."
"Well, I am not a guy, so I can promise you booze does not affect my ability to perform."
"I wouldn't wanna be on the receiving end of a drunken Succubus booty call, so take it easy."
- No promises.
Keep an eye on her.
"Okay, I don't know if it's from the buckthorn hallucinations but that was some serious sparkage."
- I think she likes you.
"- No, it doesn't matter."
"It doesn't matter, because Lauren is human."
"I sleep with her, and she dies."
This guy-
"- This guy on the other hand, he has sexual chi to burn."
He's right behind you.
A woman as lovely as yourself shouldn't be alone.
"Well, I'm not."
There's two of you.
I'm Samir.
- Bo.
- I know.
Everybody knows.
"The one who won't choose a side, neither light nor dark."
Exciting.
"Hey, kid, over here."
"Hey, uh, listen."
You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do
"- I think, you need to ease off a little bit."
- Huh?
"Yeah, look, I know you think the kids in school like you but actually they all getting really annoyed."
They are?
"Yeah, you don't know 'cause you're just a thirdgrader but take it from me, you're driving everyone crazy."
I don't blame them.
"All that singing and dancing, I can't stand it."
You don't like doing it?
It's just don't me.
What I really wanna do is just-- play basketball.
- Basketball?
- I love it.
Always have.
I've missed a game on TV.
When my dad isn't making me rehearse.
I'd love to quit singing and dancing forever and just play ball.
Dude.
You should do that.
"You should join the basketball team, right now."
- I can't.
"- Yes, you can."
What's stopping you?
It's my dad.
He thinks basketball is for sissies.
"If I don't do what he wants, he beats me."
"No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your dad what you want."
- Really?
- When you grow up into a fourthgrader you'll understand that you'll have to be tough and direct with your parents.
Go to your dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing and join the basketball team.

"Dr. Jacobs, there's a private matter"
I wish to discuss with you.
"Um, nurse oaks?"
"- Yes, madame?"
- My apologies.
"Nurse oaks, please show them the garden."
Yes?
It would be my pleasure.
"Please, come this way."
"Yes, Dr. Jacobs, there is the private matter that I would..."
"Right this way, please."
You'll find this is a lovely spot to come read a book or just enjoy the view of the woods.
"The gardens are lovely, don't you think?"
Roderick.
"They're quite nice, I must admit."
"Yes, indeed."
What order shall be taken with the prisoners?
Shoot them in the head.
I suspect witchcraft in the beast.
Where the evil which thou has driven to mingle with my being will slip away like a dream.
"Lucy, this is not a good time."
"Like the fragrance of these poisonous flowers, which will no longer taint my breath in the garden of Eden."
Is that hawthorne?
What do you mean?
"You were quoting one of Mr. hawthorne's twice-toldtales, were you not?"
I do not know what you speak of.
Did he send you?
Is this a test?
"There you are, Lucy."
"My apologies, nurse oaks."
It won't happen again.
So...radio stations in here?
"Little kday, little old-school rap for me."
"Definitely the first person to check out the radio on the backstretch, which is the fastest part of the course."
"Oh, my God."
There it is.
[ Tires screech ]
A happy tire is a squealing tire.
"That's right, making stig proud."
Good speed on the backstretch.
"All right, coming through the last turn here."
"Nice and smooth, and across the line."
[ Cheers and applause ]
"Lake, come on up."
So lovely.
How are you?
"Have a seat, please."
"It's nice, right?"
How'd it go in the suzuki?
"It's fun to say the word ""suzuki,"" you know?"
[ Laughter ]
"- So, that's, like, good news."
- Right.
"But otherwise, in terms of fastness and times, all that..."
I hope I didn't let you down.
"Oh, come on."
"No, you didn't."
"Let's just get comfortable with being in the lower Echelon, and then I'll be more comfortable with it."
Do I look comfortable?
"Everybody's gonna be comfortable because you are a beautiful woman that loves cars, so they already love you."
I love cars.
I love cars.
How'd you get into cars?
"Sorry, don't think it'd be ethical to tell you their names."
Goodbye.
Marion.
- Thanks for today.
- Anytime.
"How about tomorrow, for instance?"
I can't remember when I've had so much fun.
"I've almost forgotten the silly, wonderful things there are for two people to do."
It isn't over yet.
"Mike, please."
"- I don't think we'd better, I mean it!"
"- Connie, listen..."
"All right, let's talk about this."
I don't want to talk.
I just want you to leave.
- Just like that?
- That's right.
"- We're not kids, we're adults."
- And we'll behave like adults.
"I kissed you, you kissed me."
"That's affection, not carnality."
"That's not lust, you should know the difference."
What do you call a man who thinks about nothing but...?
Human.
All men are alike.
The approach is different but the result is always the same.
"Sooner or later, we get to this."
"If all I wanted was a woman, I could get one in a bar, in a hotel lobby..."
Or in my home?
- I'm not gonna let you make this dirty.

I'll tell you a truth about yourself.
"Well, he's come back to life."
What are his paintings worth?
Depends on size.
"And artistic merit, presumably."
"Not really, just size."
(Mobile phone rings)
He used to go for anything up to 60 grand.
What's he done with all of it?
"Get him to exhibit here, maybe I'll forgive you."
"No, I won't."
"This is crap, isn't it, Flick?"
Complete.
"No, this time you've gone too far."
"I've spoken to the lawyers, you're never going to see your son again."
I don't know how you can look at yourself every morning without throwing up.
Am I going to get a look-in on this conversation?
"No, because I know exactly what you're going to say so you can spare me the smart remarks."
"I don't know how you could let this happen in your own apartment, your own son."
"Oh, that's what this is about."
"Wendy, he's 15 years old, alright, almost 16."
He's got a girlfriend.
"Oh, you are genuinely sick if you think this is appropriate."
All I did was save our son 50 bucks on a room in some flea pit.
He's a kid.
He's in love with another kid.
With another kid?
!
Yes.
It's a girl in his English class.
He told me all about it.
"The girl from his English class is his fucking English teacher, you moron!"
Oh...
-You don't talk much.
-Neither do you.
You've figured it out haven't you?
"The less you say, the more people will reveal about themselves."
"Until little by little, they have divulged every last bit of who they are."
Because what people want most...
Is to be known.
"So, do you use that knowledge for good or for evil?"
I use it for myself.
Kiss me.
Where?
"Well, put your hands here, like that, and then"
I go like this.
"And you pull me in like that, and close your eyes."
-You wanna smoke a J?
"-No, that's not really my thing."
"You said you had a headache, though."
This is perfect for that.
"Honey, I'm already on so many painkillers;"
I don't need anything else.
"See, that's where you're wrong - marijuana is the safe alternative to that."
"Plus, you inhale it, so it works faster."
What the hell?
"Live dangerously, right?"
Ugh... it tastes like shit.
"No, no - it tastes good."
Actually I got it from my friend and he got it from a friend from another friend off the coast of Madagascar.
I guess it came up on a piece of driftwood.
I do feel better.
Is that- is that normal?
"Oh yeah, that's normal."
"Well, in that case."
Push it!
No brandy!
But-- but the pain!
Maybe you'd better let your little brazilian butcher boy do it.
"You remove it, my boy."
I can't work runder these circumstances.
Forgive me.
"Well, community?"
Tonight we stuff ourselves and drink captain taylor's brandy!
Here.
Thank you.
Save your strength.
You're going to need it.
Captain taylor!
My name's crusoe.
Where'd you come from?
"I'm a castaway on this island, but I'm here to help you."
- Are you alone?
- No.
There's more than one of you?
Just.
You're an optimist.
"If I help you regain command of your ship,"
I need your word that you'll take my companion and myself off this island with you when you set sail.
"You have it, sir."
"Jacob moore, the leader of the mutineers, is as desperate a black heart as ever lived."
"A few of the men follow him through allegiance, the rest obey him simply through fear."
I'm working on a plan.
"Until I come back, you stay here."
I will return.
"Good, sir."
Is this an old cannibal trick?
"Uh, we're not supposed to have any of that."
The Mokra don't allow it.
They can't have control of everything.
Surely there's someone who has an illegal transmitter.
I know what you'd like...
some talsa root soup.
Can you at least tell me what happened to the other people
I was with on the street?
You really should be more careful out there.
Those Mokra will pick a fight for no reason.
I don't want you getting hurt...again.
But I saw the way you handled that ugly one.
I couldn't have done any better.
"I was so proud of you, Ralkana."
My two friends...
did the Mokra take them?
I'm afraid so.
Where would they have been taken?
A detention center?
The prison.
All right.
How do I get there?
Soup.
I'm forgetting the soup.
"I appreciate your hospitality, but I can't stay here."
I've got to get to that prison.
"You're right, the time has come."
"Now we're together again, we can't wait another day."
My beautiful and brave...
girl.
The Mokra won't stand a chance against us.
"You're very kind to offer, but I didn't mean we'd be going together."
- Giant oysters are the best.
- Some of them were humongous.
- Big oysters.
""" 15,000 kroner for legal assistance."" Okay."
- For what?
- That matter with the mouth painter.
- Fine.
You want the money up front?
- No.
We talked about it the locker room.
I thoroughly explained your options according to the law.
I'm afraid you're going to have to tell me again.
I didn't hear it.
- Weren't you listening?
- I didn't hear a word.
"Bloody hell, Frank."
"Casper, you were there."
I remember you standing there...
I couldn't quite concentrate because you weren't wearing any trousers.
- So...
- You're making me feel ill at ease.
There I was explaining things and you just stared at my crotch.
- You were very close to me.
- We're all guys in the locker room.
"Mads told me how to deal with the mouth painter, in the locker room."
I had his pecker in my face so I didn't hear a word.
"Oh, come on."
I quietly told you what to do...
"Save it for the locker room, please."
I'm going to take this and leave.
Nice to see you.

"And then the walls started making that noise, and I just had to get out of there."
"So I'm sitting in my car, and I'm just......"

Well that was a long trip for nothing.
How long have you known me?
Point taken.

Now get out of here.
No hang on.

I should tell him about Lola.

"Oh, Vera!"
"Come in, my dear."
"Or come out, whichever it is."
I wasn't expecting you till next weekend.
Then you don't mind my surprising you?
Still the same Vera.
Just the same.
You might have caught me making up to one of the nurses.
"Here, sit down, my dear, sit down."
"How are you feeling, John?"
I've quite taken to this sort of life.
It's rather pleasant.

"Of course, they'd..."

I'm sure Harold is doing excellently.
He's a very clever young man.
"A little erratic, but I dare say he's learning."
"Well, he's doing the best he can, but he needs help."

I don't see how I could do that.

Just about.
Too many things change in that time.
I don't know what conditions are.

He's canceling the regular monthly order for the shop.
Oh.
"Oh, that's too bad."
"Axel, you didn't buy all these years from Carl just because he's my brother."
You bought because he handles the highest grade of S and F hardwood.
"Sure, sure, but if Mr. Somers wants to buy somewhere else, can I stop him?"
You want me to tell you why he cancelled out?
I'll tell you why.
Because he wants to buy cheap commercial grades of lumber.
Nothing but spruce and hemlock.
"Carl, if Somers did like you say, he will cheapen trademark."
He would make it nothing.
Why would he want to kill goose that lays the golden eggs?
That's crazy.
But Carl loses his biggest account.
What can we do?

I'm personally very happy with my body the way it is.
"Well, that's very progressive of you."
But you pay me to tell it like I see it.
I see you both need help in this department.
- What was wrong with Kleenex?
"- They're lumpy, and these?"
These are light and comfortable and they have just the right amount of jiggle.
"See, I'm wearing them right now."
Would you like to feel?
"- Oh, no, no."
I'm good.
"- No, thanks."
To get their bearings.
Exactly.
"Once they go through here, they'll have a much better idea of where they're headed."
So that's why we release them up here.
And we can just gently release this.
How extraordinary.Here they go!
And notice one thing - they're headed straight towards the brightest spot.
They are - straight for the sun.
That is the most incredible sight.
Fantastic.
Look at them!
Look at him!
They're desperate!
"There's no hanging around, they're not nervous about it - straight in the sea."
"Notice as soon as they float, they change their swimming pattern."
Just like a clockwork toy.
"Look, there's one last one up here - look, Stephen."
"Oh, yes."
Come on.
"Come on, you."
"Oh, no, the crab grabbed it as it went over the hole."
Rescue it!
"I know you're not supposed to intervene, but hey!"
"That's it, go for it."
Good luck!
Yeah!
Made for the water.
"Oh, that's fantastic."
I've never seen anything quite so magical in all my life.
That's one of the best wildlife things I've seen.
"20-25 years from now, hopefully she'll be back laying eggs if she's a girl."
That was fantastic.
We need to show them an example.
An example?
"Yes, and we don't need many."
One should be enough.
Do you understand what I am talking about?
"Sir, you have to leave us with something to live on before you collect the tax."
Please don't be so cruel.
"Boy, there's not getting through to you!"
So what are you saying?
Are you not going to pay your taxes?
"We would if we could, but we can't afford to."
Don't you realize tax evasion is a serious crime?
Don't waste my time!
Please!
What are you waiting for?
Take the salt and load it up!
No!
You might as well be telling us to die!
Step aside?
"No, you'll have to kill me first?"
How are you interfere with government business!
What are you waiting for?
Arrest him!
"No, Father?"
Or they'll take you to.
Father!
Father!
Father!
"Chun-su's, Father?"
"What do you mean, Mother?"
"I don't know why, but I'm told they were arrested and badly punished by the officials."
It looked like he was unconscious when I saw him.
"- Where you going, dog?"
- Let me go!
- Calm down!
- I'm gonna kill those bitches!
You already did!
Repeat hemogram and update tetanus.
Keep your hand there and don't take it off until you get upstairs.
"- Dr. Corday, when you have a chance?"
- Be right there.
Make sure the blood bank sends type-specific straight to the OR.
Have the anesthesiologist call me with any questions.
- Are you the one...?
- A neurosurgeon will perform it.
He'll talk with you shortly.
- I'm sorry?
- Don't let me die.
"You' re one cold-hearted bitch, you know that?"
"I don't have any damn pity for you, whore!"
"I'm talking to you, pissface!"
"Don't you dare turn your back on me, you stuck-up little ass-shaker!"
Where the hell do you think you' re going?
!
Pardon me.
Coming through.
"Watch your back, sweetie."
Excuse me.
"- Doc, I'm gonna miss the season-"
- Keep your cup on.
I should have been off two hours ago.
You still here?
Can't leave till my patient gets a bed.
Them's the rules.
"Don't worry, they don't know who you are."
I didn't come here to catch you.
"Till now, your strength and my weakness were the same."
I didn't know who you were till date.
"But now, both our levels are equal."
Arresting you  killing you is not a big deal.
I won't do that.
Do you know why?
You are my special case.
"You are my partner, aren't you?"
I won't leave you so easily.
I will catch you red handed with evidence.
I will know your every move.
Forget about robbing.
"The moment you think of robbing, I will cut your nerves and pluck your heart out."
Rs. 500 crores.
Election fund.
Party office.
12 noon.
Tomorrow.
You challenged that you will catch me red hand.
Catch...you can never catch me.
This is the real kick.
Kalyan or Kalyankrishna...?
Check everyone thoroughly before sending them in.
Be it MLAs or Ministers.
Why so much security?
There is a terror threat to the party office.
I know.
I told you that.
Count fast.
- High command has entrusted me to distribute the election funds.
"does this mean ""no""?"
'cause i love you.
"- oh, wayne, you only love me because we live in this crap town."
"but when you get to where you're going, you're gonna find somebody that you deserve to be with."
you don't deserve to be in a trailer park.
you're gonna do big things in this life -- important things.
- you really think so?
- i know so.
"okay, so i have one more gift for you, but you have to turn around."
- hey!
"- well, now you're all ready for college!"
"come here, wayne."
merry christmas.
- oh. excuse me.
"excuse me, miss?"
[chuckles] yeah.
i-is the salon open?
- c-c-can you see that we're in the middle of something?
"- cind, you might want to... ma'am, i apologize for her."
she can be a tad on the abrasive side sometimes.
but her heart's in the right place.
- look at you using all these big college words already.
- i'm sorry.
i didn't mean to intrude.
"i just wanted to know if the salon was open, 'cause i wanted, you know, a redo or a rebirth."
"- you know, i've heard all the stor-  hey, listen, i really don't need to hear your life story, okay?"
"can you come back in an hour, and i'll fix that mess?"
- okay. an hour.
- [chuckling] cindy.
- what?
- you should be nice.
[sighs] merry christmas.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
"He said, he wanted to see it coming."
- When?
- While you're out.
- Did he say anything else?
- Like what?
"Like, why he wants to check out so bad?"
- A little.
- Well?
He's....got bad cancer.
It's in my pancreas and spreading.
Going to die and I'd rather not take the scenic route.
"I don't think he has anybody who loves him either, it must be even worse."
We should think about going to his funeral.
"You know, just so there's someone there."
What?
"At the end of the day, Donnie'll send surviving' members of his squad to finish the job either way."
"So if it's not us to finish, it would be somebody else."
"And besides, this guy's dead already!"
"In fact, it's way better if we're the ones to do it."
"Because unlike Donnie's punks, we're not gonna torture him for eight or nine hours first."
Did you hear somethin'?
What happened to you anyway?
You look a little mussed up.
What's with the it chilled?
- This?
- Yea.
I've been deputized.
"- I'm serious, Vi."
- Fine!
I had a little incident while I was out getting the bullets.
And if it backfires... what do I risk?
Don't ask what you risk... but if you'll be true to yourself.
"The prints of ""Weekend in Sochaux"" are booked all summer."
It's possible in September.
"For unions, it's free of charge."
Fine.
I'll send you the form.
For us the problem was how to incorporate their demans into a larger revolutionary context.
We were stuck.
So we gave the camera to the workers.
What they shot was pretty surprising.
Stronger that what we did.
Their perspective is truer.
They go straight to the heart of the problem.
I think we've gathered enough material.
They want to edit it themselves.
I'm not at all sure about this.
They need a minimum of technical skills.
We have to help.
Monique can go do the technical stuff.
Great.
That settles it.
I went shopping.
Tonight I work at the restaurant.
With the lesbians?
Not lesbians.
Feminists.
Did you pick up the print?
The phone was ringing all day.
But I need it for tomorrow.
So get it yourself.
I didn't mean that.
I've been dieting for a whole half a day and I haven't even lost a pound.
"Sabrina, I found that the key to losing weight is eating the right foods."
Who are you channeling?
The other day I saw you put sugar on bacon.
Lean bacon.
There's got to be something in here that will help me fit in my dress.
"Hey, look at this ad."
"""Thanks to Blubber-Be-Gone,"
"I lost 50 pounds in three days."""
That's ridiculous.
"What'd he do, lop off a leg?"
Here goes.
"""Thin my thighs, lose my roll, make me skinnier than Manute Bol."""
Ooh!
I see you called me in the nick of time.
I did?
Losing weight the Blubber- Be-Gone way is easy.
"Whenever you're hungry, instead of eating food, just mix yourself a shake."
Taste?
Not bad;
although I still prefer ipecac.
SALEM:
"Excuse me, but I think we've met before."
Weren't you selling that turn-your-eye-gunk- into-gold kit a few years ago?
"No, that must have been my brother."
Happy dieting.
This is great.
"I'm going to lose weight,"
"I'm going to look fantastic in my new special dress, and I'll be elected queen of the ball."
Right.
"And one of these days, my pink eye is going to pay off big."
"Oh, no."
"I still have to put her medicine in her food, but..."
... she's60percentimproved.
That problem with her fatigas.
Excuse me?
The dog's fatigas is better now.
That problem she had.
Was that a euphemism?
"Oh, boy, here we go with the Latin."
"You know, the fatigas."
It's like the female private parts.
"Boy, I tell you, I'm sweating up a storm here."
You're just a little nervous.
I'll come clean with you. I haven't had sex sober in about 20 years.
"You're not gonna scare me off, Andy."
"I know what you were like, and I know what you're like now."
And I think you're a good man.
"And in your own way, very charming."
So you want to hit the sack?
I'd like it if you kissed me.
I'm getting a new bed cover.
I've got it on order.
-Wanna fold that up or--?
-Sh.
"You realize that if I don't hold up my end, so to speak..."
... Imayhavetokill you.
Somehow it doesn't feel like it's gonna be a problem.

Here...you will have to do this part of the work.
I swear...if I had a physique like yours I would have bowled over all the girls in India.
"In such a big place, where could Kania have hidden the fake currency printing dyes?"
I hope you don't think what happened last night changes anything.
It changes everything.
You can't still be planning to go into business with that woman.
- I am.
- She won't be satisfied until she has destroyed everything we've created here.
"Don't be fooled, Tommy."
This whole nightmare is because of her.
"Sarah, there is enough blame to go around."
- Is that a dig at me?
- We lied.
Dad lied.
"In fact, right now, Holly's probably the most honest one of us all."
You can't be that naive.
I already told you!
I didn't start this winery for you or Mom.
All right?
I did this for me.
Building something for myself.
That was before the horror show landed on my lap!
"Look, it landed in our laps."
You want to control everything.
"God, you just thrive off of control."
- But this is out of your hands.
"- Spare me, Tommy, OK?"
"I already pay for therapy, I really don't need your amateur psychoanalysis."
Just let it go.
OK.
"Well, clearly I'm the only one who still gives a damn about Ojai, so you'll understand that I have work to do."
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Holly Harper.
She's not in her office.
I don't know where she...
You go from here.
I wont find the same situation again.
"You dad with me in this room, on bed... final the car's deal."
Car's deal when?
Now here on this bed... should i tell Sonu?
No...
why?
Youth dad wanted to hide from you.
Actually he bought the vintage car to sale his stuff... in 1000000/-.
1000000/-?
"What is all this Dad, we already have car, cancel."
"Cancel the deal, the deal is cancel."
"Laxmi Jee you told deal done, bed!"
But dad?
Deal is done.
But my advance of 100000/-
i and sitting in front of underworld don.
You know... why i have started undergarment business.
Because it has under like underworld.
I got this 100000/-
"Laxmi Narayan Jee, thank you, the car is yours, i should leave now, i have to make agreements papers."
Come at 4 o'clock and get 900000/- too yeah sure.
You saved me.
And you caught me.
I always wanted to marry some... some underworld don.
"How excited, how thrill there life is."
Husband go in the morning.
And wife didn't know if the husband will come back home or not.
In the night when husband come back and kiss.
It is feel like that's a last kiss.
Because don't know from where bullet can come.
And husband could have encounter.
Yes.
"It's a lot to ask of you, Alice, I know."
"But that's what families are for, right?"
"Yeah, he's just walked in, Jeff, as a matter of fact."
Yes.
"So, absolutely, I'll pass it on."
"Okay, if you can just watch your shooting ratio, love."
"Yeah, we'll see you then."
Cheers.
-How are things on location?
-Very hot apparently.
He said it's like a furnace in that room.
'Cause they're right under the flight path they've got to keep all the windows closed and there's bugger all ventilation.
But they're all thrilled with the material.
He said the whole thing's got a real buzz to it.
It's gonna be really different to the rest of the series.
And John's put together a bit of cut material for you to have a look at.
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
-What?
"-No, I've just... been getting a lot of static electricity today."
"Just after I'd polished the table, it was a combination, maybe, the friction and the weather."
"Anyway, what happened to you?"
You get whiplash or something?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
What?
What?
Tell me.
I went to an orgy.
"Yeah, right."
-What did I say?
I said you wouldn't believe me.
-An orgy?
"Well, I know you know."
"Now, I may have run across Mrs. Sellers at the grocery today."
And she just may have mentioned that
John was gonna give me his pin tonight?
Possibly.
"I have lots of pins from lots of boys, Mama."
"I know, Zelda dear."
"I've been followin' along lo these many years, but somehow this one's different, isn't it, baby?"
"How do you know when it's different, Mama?"
I don't know.
What kind of answer is that?
What kind of answer did you want?
"Well, he cares about you a great deal."
Anyone can see that and...
"You know, he'll certainly be able to care for you."
Those are not unimportant things.
I know that.
"You and Daddy never think I do, but I do."
It's what worried everyone so about Scott.
"But, Mama... you weren't happy marrying' Daddy."
"Oh, come now, Zelda."
I know there were other possibilities.
Were you in love with any of them?
You can find something to love about every man if you put your mind to it.
I don't want to have to put my mind to it.
"But you will, baby."
Whether you want to or not.
I'm just gonna run this laundry downstairs.
"I can do that, Mama."
"Oh, of course."
"Thank you, dear."
[ticking]
Did you two get into my four-quadrant popcorn tin?
Relax.
We were just sniffing it.
Stand up and show me your fingers.
"If I see any cheese dust, you're both grounded."
Dust-free.
You happy?
"Dude, you're unbelievable."
Popcorn is the snack of the people.
No.
It's a snack for dads only.
I get one tin a year from my armoire dealer in Cincinnati.
It's the only thing that gets me through the season.
"There are so many sad things in that sentence, but I honestly think the winner is ""Cincinnati."""
"Well, just keep your hands off the tin."
That's it.
End of story.
And the same goes for the thermostat.
"Yeah, I see you two looking."
That's 'cause it's colder in this house
- than it is outside.
"- Yeah, man."
Can't you spare like two more degrees?
"If you two are so cold, go out and shovel the walkway."
That ought to work up a sweat but good.
"Murray Goldberg had a lot of dumb dad rules, but nothing equaled his hard line on snow."
And no monkeying around out there when you're done.
- This weather is treacherous.
"- Oh, here we go."
Another lecture on the dangers of cold weather.
I'm serious.
It's not safe out there.
"Oh, you pretty things."
That's right - north for about 40 miles.
And then all we gotta do is-
"Oh, if you could only cook."
"Then all we have to do is find the knoll... upon which stands a tree, half-shattered by lightning."
And the cabin.
Near that knoll.
"Gee, I wonder what it's gonna be like... having things instead of wishing for 'em."
Hmm.
Not nearly so much fun.
"You're wrong, Claire."
Wishing never got anybody anyplace.
It's owning something that counts.
Taking it when you can't get it any other way - that's all right too.
It's the law up here
- The law of the Klondike.
"When there's something you need, grab it."
Take it away from the other guy.
It's a good law.
It works.
Nope.
It only works when you deserve to have what you take.
Otherwise it's stealing.
Perhaps that particular commandment isn't respected up here.
They all get broken.
That one gets splintered.
"Well, Noah... that boat manipulating's a little too tough for my delicate constitution... so if you don't mind, sir, I shall go below."
Good night.
"- Night, Shorty."
- Night.
"Good night, dice."
Summer's just around the corner.
"- It was a reunion, and they were great."
- They're okay.
"A couple of years ago, Mom drove us in to shop."
"She couldn't find a good parking place, and all of the lots were total rip-offs."
So she kept making u-turns and cutting off taxis... and we were being screamed at in so many different languages... that we just turned around and drove home... and bought a Hummel at the curio shop in Stars Hollow.
Very adventurous.
I'm just saying I'm no stranger to the Big Apple.
You are if you're calling it the Big Apple.
"So I don't have the lingo down yet, but I have the attitude."
- You do?
- Yeah.
When I was getting a locker for my backpack... at the bus stop there was this guy just standing there staring at me.
"And instead of ignoring him, I fixed him with a really withering stare."
- That I've got to see.
- No.
Come on.
Let me see your withering stare.
It's dangerous.
I could hurt you.
- I've been hurt before.
- No.
I'm disappointed.
"- So, your arm's okay?"
- Yeah.
It looks worse than it is.
I like this Emily chick.
A friend of yours?
She's a friend to all of us dispossessed.
- So here's our lunch place.
- A hot-dog stand?
I eat here everyday.
"It's nothing fancy, but..."
Cast off the bow lines.
"We're good to go, first thing."
"Bring her back in one piece, Joe, you're goin' without me."
Did you hear back from the city planner?
Yeah.
She confirmed that viaducts were built over the old rail lines.
What used to be on street level is now a subterranean ghost town.
"Well, Valera and his cohorts must have used that to hide Sara 'cause after we lifted our roadblocks, it would've been easy to move her."
"Yeah, well, we might've identified one of those cohorts."
"This Bluetooth you found, turns out the units are embedded with 48 bit identifiers."
This one's synced to a cell phone.
You got a number?
Better.
I got a name.
Marcy's boyfriend.
Ben Wilson.
- Ben.
- Hey.
I need to know what's going on.
What are you talking about?
Why was there blood on your sweatshirt?
"You took it, didn't you?"
"I need the truth, Ben."
"Believe me, it's better if you don't know."
Don't try to protect me.
I can't stand that.
Okay.
Someone paid me to deliver that money.
Who?
I didn't think it was a big deal.
The delivery went bad.
"A guy got hurt, but it was nothing to do with Sara and it was nothing to do with me."
Grab the steering wheel!
And go!
What do they want?
Stop.
This is the expected behaviour if they wave at us.
It must just be some sort of greeting.
They seem to be evolving in this respect as well.
It seems as if a simple movement of the hand replaced handshakes.
This is how they signal that they aren't carrying weapons.
And what do you know about this?
It must be some sort of routine check.
Prepare your IDs.
There's no point looking in the bag.
It's full of the items related to the fire.
"In the small box, doctor."
"Not a doctor, but a land surveyor."
Five o'clock.
"According to the Memoirs, the Bernaus' house is just starting to burn now."
You should be ashamed of yourself!
Your father and mother are working hard.
"While you... instead of practicing,"
"- But Mum, I was..."
- I don't care.
I know you can always find some excuse.
So.
Take it.
"And now, play something nice."
"There, at the window."
Down there.
Let me hear it.
Fido!
"Go down to your father, and apologize to him."
- Madam.
- What is it?
What are you doing here?
Please take me in.
I do not wish to invite trouble by taking in Master Yi's man.
Leave.
But you promised you'd take me in.
The situation has changed.
I must break that promise.
I mean to sever my ties with Master Yi.
You don't have to...
that tie is already severed.
The master is dead.
What do you mean he's dead?
Jang Bogo attacked and took the master's life.
Is Yum Moon also dead?
He wasn't at the base at the time of attack.
Please...
...take me in.
"If you don't take me, I've no place to go."
How can I trust a man who ran away to save his own life when his master is dead?
What?
Who's to say you won't betray your master again?
That will never happen.
I will give my life for you.
I will give you a chance to prove your loyalty.
Say anything.
I will do anything.
We need to recruit more people.
What do you plan to do by hiring more people when we should be letting people go to survive Madam Jami's advances?
I will send merchants all over Shilla.
I will trade cotton and salt at marketplaces where Madam Jami's influence hasn't reached.
"hen the most important thing for us at that stage for some reason, in our minds, was:"
What are we gonna wear?
So ridiculous.
e hadn't even thought of a name.
We didn't even know if we could sing together.
"NiaII did say, ""We all need to dress a bit like Louis."""
NiaII looked at Louis' shoes.
He was quite cool.
""" I Iike his shoes."
"We should wear his shoes."""
Green polo.
We like those jeans.
Let's all wear those jeans.
I Iook back on it now.
If we'd have dressed like that.... e first got together at Harry's dad's place.
e did not know each other at all.
e'd get together and sing a few songs in the nighttime around the campfire.
e were meant to be rehearsing but we actually ended up playing football.
Most of the time we just spent having a laugh really.
e were lik e.
""" Let's just have fun."""
"Let's just have fun and, Iike, see what happens."
t was vital that we made friends before we became colleagues.
The first act through on the public votes is:
One Direction.
Love you!
Outside the studio they've only sang once.
here's now 200 fans.
"And I thought at the time, ""This is unusual."
"This just doesn't happen after one performance."""
The crowds were starting to build outside the studio.
"Harry, get a picture with me!"
- Julie's webcam.
"It would be too bad if this film were to go around court, wouldn't it?"
"What do you mean, go around?"
"To avoid that, you need to help us."
What kind of help?
- Working for us.
Tell us exactly where Roban is in the Villedieu case.
I can't.
I'm sworn to secrecy.
"Speaking of secrets, you know that Julie is underage?"
"That's crazy, she's in the first year of law school!"
Look.
She's in high school.
You see?
"Must admit, she is pretty talented for a 15-year-old."
"If you refuse to help us, within 30 minutes this film will be sent to every magistrate's mailbox."
"When they realise the girl is underage, they won't do you any favours."
And you will be disbarred for life.
"Harsh, isn't it?"
Gilou!
Tintin!
What's going on?
The Crime Squad has found the guy Gilou argued with at the squat.
How do you know?
- I just know.
"If the guy talks, they'll be able to get to Patricia."
"- Knowing her, she'll talk."
- The Crime Squad can't implicate Gilou.
- The bullet doesn't come from his gun.
"- Wait, Bremont isn't stupid."
He'll know we covered up for Gilou if Patricia says she was with him.
He'll realise I tampered with the seal.
Striking lack of empathy or compassion for other people.
- Bordering between autism...
- Stop.
"You know, I didn't always do this."
This is my first station assignment.
I was on the other end of the numbers.
Looking at nine million black-book tax dollars.
Recruited me straight out of college.
Said it was the best opportunity I'd ever have.
"Told me I'd do special things, important things."
"Well, you're worth more than what some bureaucrat wrote down on a piece of paper 20 years ago."
All they're really talking about is what's real.
Reality.
They know how to use it.
They're good at it.
Why not quit?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"I knew a guy once, and he decided he wanted to quit."
"He squirreled away money for about 20 years and he opened up a bar and wanted to create a new life, and he survived about 37 months."
They killed him?
"No, I did."
See if you can get into those files.
Emerson gets here.
Get off me!
Get the fuck off!
Get it off me!
- How much longer?
- Little while still.
"Go on, David, tell her to come out."
Tell her to come out right now!
Fuck you!
Science is changing the way women age.
This next generation of women will all be GILFs.
[applause]
All right.
All right.
Calm down out there.
"Okay, so, Kiara, what're the kind of things that you might do now that you wouldn't have done in your 30s?"
"Well, for me, I didn't even know what good sex was until I turned 50."
(MURPHY SCREAMING)
ANDERSON:
Where did you learn that?
My father was a doctor.
Bridger!
FITZGERALD:
"Captain, we got a swarm of tree niggers out here waiting to finish the job."
Tell me you got some kind of plan.
Glass?
Missouri's no good.
Not while the Ree's running it.
We got to get off this boat.
"Oh, you want to get off the boat?"
"Then what do we do, huh?"
Take our furs and sit out there amongst the Ree like a bunch of ducks?
Only safe thing to do is track a new course back up on land.
That'll add weeks to the trip.
Better than floating where they can get eyes on us.
"They got eyes on you right now, son."
What I'm saying is we stay on the boat.
Chart a course toward the fort and take our chances on the water.
Glass knows this territory best.
It's his job to get us home safe.
Get us home safe?
You look like a gangster.
They shot me.
Help!
"Henry, shut the door."
That was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
Can't have that in here.
Jesus Christ!
I can't have that in this joint.
"I remember feeling bad about the guy,"
But I also remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.
I knew Paulie didn't want anyone dying in the building.
You're a real jerk.
You wasted eight fucking aprons on this guy.
I don't know what the hell's wrong with you.
I got to toughen this kid up.
It was a glorious time.
And wiseguys were all over the place.
It was before Apalachin and before Crazy Joe decided to take on a boss and start a war.
It was when I met the world.
And it was when I first met Jimmy Conway.
"He couldn't have been more than 28 or 29 at the time, but he was already a legend."
He'd walk in the door and everybody who worked the room just went wild.
He'd give a doorman $100 just for opening the door.
He'd shove hundreds in the pockets of the dealers and all the guys that ran the games.
"I mean, the bartender got $100 just for keeping the ice cubes cold."
The Irishman is here to take all you Guineas' money.
-Want a drink?
-Give me a Seven and Seven.
Jimmy. I'd like you to meet the kid Henry.
How you doin'?
Pleasure.
Thank you.
- Hey.
- Hi.
I drove by the park earlier.
"You said you were gonna be there with the kids, you know."
And I... stopped and watched you for a minute.
I didn't spot you.
No?
"Well, lucky you're not a detective."
Lucky you're not a comedian.
What d'you think?
About what?
The kids.
"Well, the big one sure knows how to hit a baseball."
"I know, but he's got this hitch in his swing."
He'll never get around on the really fast stuff.
He's like his old man.
Do you know that I'm the first male Felton in five generations to have his original front teeth?
- Thank you for sharing.
- You're welcome.
"Hey, Beau, did you ever take refresher course in interrogation technique that Professor Landriff teaches?"
I'm not much on refresher courses.
"Well, the first day, he writes on the blackboard,"
"""Let the suspect talk."""
"""The interrogation is not about you."""
That's good advice.
"I didn't ask you here to interrogate you, Beau."
Of course not.
"We don't have to try to make the other one say it, we can say it ourselves."
Sure.
It's over between us.
Isn't it?
Yeah.
- You know.
- Are you kidding me?
You know what?
"Forget it, okay?"
I'm gonna do this by myself.
"I'm gonna go find some classy, sophisticated people who can hold their booze, who don't talk about their bleached assholes, and who aren't obsessed with poop."
"Okay, bring me up to speed here, boys."
This is an interesting piece.
I love his use of space.
The space... that's what I loved about it.
What do you think the chunky earth tones represent?
"Look at the rich texture, the dimensions."
It's almost as if you can smell it.
"Oh, God..."
This is the piece I was telling you about.
"It's unbelievable... and so raw, so base, so utterly human."
It's almost as if it exploded out of the artist.
Well...
I think it's crap.
Crap...
Crap...
Crap...
Crap...
You know what?
"Guys, let's just wrap up the evidence and start again fresh tomorrow."
"You think they'll keep, or should we put them in the fridge?"
They'll keep fine.
You know what?
"You guys win, all right?"
Are you happy?
Win what?
Heart failure!
She must've overheard us talking about it.
I told Zaddik it might be the key to making her human.
"Please, you've got to find her before the villagers do."
"Look, Ronon says we're close."
"If we lose the trail now, we may never catch the wraith."
Rodney and I will find her.
"All right, but be careful."
Understood.
I'll come with you.
"No, I think it's best if you stay here."
"Look, is there anywhere that she likes to go,"
Any favorite hiding spots or favorite places?
"Yes, she often goes off for hours at a time, up into the hills."
"I don't like it, but she doesn't listen to me."
It's a start.
"You know, I thought it was pretty nuts when Ronon was trying to track a wraith through this forest."
"Now that it's just us, do you feel any better?"
"Oh, yeah."
Supremely confident.
Father.
Ellia.
Where did you go?
I was hiding.
I didn't want the others to know... to know what?
"Ellia, why did you take the retrovirus?"
Because I don't want to be this way anymore.
I hate what I am.
If you heard what dr.
"Beckett said, you know the retrovirus isn't ready."
I had no choice.
"When they kill the other wraith,"
I won't be able to pretend anymore.
I thought you were dying.
I thought so too.
The pain was excruciating.
"Julia, do you think if you asked him, Wilcox would give us champagne tonight?"
I hate champagne and Mr Ryder has already had dinner.
Mister Ryder?
Mister Ryder?
Charles drinks champagne at all hours.
"Do you know, looking at this great swaddled foot of mine, I can't get it out of my head that I've got gout, and that gives me a craving for champagne."
- Which way?
- This way.
Dinner was served in the Red Dining Room.
"While they dined, I ate a peach and told them of the war with my father."
"And he said to him ""Living in London, you must miss... your national game."" And Colin said What national game?""... and my father said ""Cricket, of course."""
I really think he's sometimes quite mad.
He sounds a perfect poppet to me.
And now I'm going to leave you boys.
- Where are you off to?
- The nursery.
I promised Nanny a last game of halma.
Dear Nanny Hawkins.
She lives entirely for pleasure.
"Goodnight, Mr Ryder and goodbye."
I'm leaving early.
I can't tell you how grateful I am to you for relieving me at the sick bed.
My sister's very pompous tonight.
I don't think she cares for me.
I don't think she cares for anyone very much.
- I love her.
She's so like me.
- Do you?
Is she?
"When I first had Geneva, it was like..."
"I recognized her, you know?"
"I mean, she had Dave's smile, and she had my eyes, and..."
What is it?
I can't say anything right with Dave these days.
I thought things were better.
We haven't slept in the same bed in months.
"And ever since the wedding, it's--"
"He's been acting even more distant, you know."
It's like...
I don't understand.
"Something just changed that day, and I can't tell if I'm pushing him away or he's pulling away, or I..."
I don't know.
It's just all...
"You still love him, right?"
"Well... if I didn't, would I be crying at this stupid chick song?"
"Look, your marriage is worth saving, so you gotta stop talking and start doing."
"- Doing what, though?"
- Being there for him.
Being involved in what he likes and what he's doing.
"If it's work that's absorbing his time, get into it."
"If it's something he cares about, you gotta care about it, too."
- I do.
I do.
- Don't tell me.
Show him.
"I really like you, Suzanne."
I want to work things out with Deena.
Nobody's stopping you.
I shouldn't even be here.
"You have a lot going on with your marriage, the launch..."
So why not just be in the moment?
"I don't like your manner, I don't like your style, I don't like your attitude."
But I do like your ideas.
"Stephens, I'm putting next year's entire campaign in your hands."
- You are?
- Yes.
We've been advertising the same way for 30 years.
It's not working anymore.
That's why I changed agencies decided we have to keep things up-to-date.
Get to work on that campaign right away.
"And remember one thing, gentlemen Waterhouse is my name and thumbtacks is my game."
He wants me.
"Darrin, you must have somebody watching over you."
"Larry, I just learned something."
"- When a man can't lose, he can't win."
- Where are you going?
"- To a bar, to drown my sorrows."
- Drown your sorrows?
You just landed a big account.
"Well, let's just say I'm a sore winner."
"Yeah, you came to the right guy for advice, Darrin."
I'm an expert.
I know everything about marriage.
That's why I'm still single.
I don't get it.
I'm married to a girl who can have anything in the whole world yet she chose me.
- Take my brother.
He's had four years of happy marriage.
"The trouble is, he's been married for 16."
She must love me.
Gave up everything for me.
But obviously she misses all those luxuries.
Who can blame her?
"He hit me with rod, non-stop hitting..."
He hit from the left and then from the right...
He wanted to use a pair of swords to kill me.
I haven't seen these evidence before.
They are our new discoveries.
"To kill a person, why should he bring along so many weapons?"
That strongly proved that he was well-planned to kill Chun.
He even wanted to kill innocent citizen.
"Even though, he didn't mind to die with all."
Bull shit!
You creeper!
"You are framing me, you will die a dog's death!"
Bastard!
You will go to hell!
"Your Honour, I request to charge Foon with some more charges... threatening judiciary officer, contempt of court, bodily injury, and throw rubbish in public place."
Chan Mon-gut.
"I didn't do it, I didn't do it."
Don't lose your mind.
Why did you throw my shoe away?
Give me back my shoe.
Take this first.
Super swords!
Capital Chopper!
I smell something weird.
What's this?
Cat's stool.
Why are you that hungry?
It may be very important clues.
"Brother Lone, what made you think so?"
Because of my name.
I made many clues.
How about that shoe?
When is a man safe from such wit.
if infirmity does not protect him?
If he is infirm.
then I am at death's door.
- He complained of rheumatism.
"- ""A slight ache"" was his phrase."
Edward said he would bring it himself.
"""It gives me great pleasure to restore this atlas to its owner."""
"""Business prevents my delivering it, which will hurt me more than you."""
"""Memories of your kindness must sustain me."
And I remain -
"- Your devoted servant, E.C. Ferrars."""
- Why hasn't he come?
"- He says he's busy, dear."
- He said he'd come.
Why hasn't he?
- I'm taking you for a walk.
- It is going to rain.
- It is not going to rain.
I fear Mrs. Jennings is a bad influence.
- You must miss him.
Elinor.
"- We are not engaged, Mamma."
"- But he loves you, dearest."
- I am by no means assured of that.
"And had he such a preference, there would certainly be obstacles -"
- To his marrying a woman of no rank who cannot afford to buy sugar.
- But your heart must tell you...
- It is better to use one's head.
- It can't be good for me.
- It is.
Stop complaining.
"""where moth and rust doth corrupt,"" Matthew, 6:19, but it's a handy little case is that."
And a record come with it.
Shall I put it on so we know how we have to do it tomorrow?
Are you allowed to play it?
Yeah.

Does it not matter what I say?
Get inside!
"Mam, we were just..."
You were just showing me up.
You can leave that.
What are you going to do with it?
I might put it in the bin.
"Don't, Mam!"
No... brother...
"Jeeya Jee is like my child no, not like child, she is my child."
"Muna, Papu what are you doing, when ever i call you, you come."
"Get out from here, don't you have any other work, Shut up!"
Now greet and get lost.
Or i will shoot you right here.
You don't worry your brother is with you.
And you never told me that you know big don of Mumbai.
"Not to worry, from today if there is any work for me, ask me."
"Here's the money, bubble gum... get lost!"
"Go Munday go... wow, you did well acting for a underworld don."
Munday ran away... but where this gum came from?
I am Bhai (brother) of Underworld for real... i am bhai (brother)
For real?
You are Bhai (brother)
Son...
Son...
Laxmi Narayan is my father and i am his son.
"Here Father, Son and Uncle... 3 type of Laxmi Narayan are here."
So which one you want Sir?
"Sir, can you get me to there room."
"God knows, after Sono's mom, i turned off all my feelings"
you have tune on them again.
"I call sister, every women."
"I told you the size of bra, by seeing but i have never seen anyone with bad eye."
You have left me for nowhere.
You has told to show it?
"So i am undergarment saler, what i elss i would look for?"
"You do business in car, right?"
Yeah i do business in car!
Is it wrong?
Selling undergarments in car?
- No.
[Grunts]
You'll never find them again.
What the hell?
[Growls]
[Breathing heavily]
He's not himself.
He's been acting weird.
"I'm just, you know, worried about him as to what he saw."
Has he said anything?
"No, but I can tell there's something not right."
Hank's got to be shook up about this in some way.
"You know, I mean whether he's talking about it or not, when I saw him looking up at me, he was freaked."
- Aah!
- [Groans]
"And it's a look I've seen before, let me tell you."
"I'm sure you're hoping it will just go away, and he won't say anything, but look."
"This is not, like, your ordinary nightmare, okay?"
He knows he was awake.
And his brain is trying to process the unprocessable.
"I mean, what did you think when you first saw one woge?"
[Snarls]
- I thought I was going crazy.
"- Right, well..."
"Hank's probably going through the same thing, you know?"
"You know, with you, it was one thing."
He was hit.
He was knocked out.
He was a little dazed.
"But I mean, he saw Brinkerhoff change."
That is so not going to make it any easier.
"Trust me, mental hospitals are chock-full of people who have spent their lives trying to wrap their minds around things they've seen and can't explain."
Are we going to make a cake?
You going to make a fucking cake?
You got anything good in there?
is it good?
"Bye-bye, dickhead."
"See you in Attica, dick."
I spoke to Jimmy.
He offered to give me some money.
He wants to know what's happening.
He just wants to talk to you.
Fuck Jimmy and his money!
"I told you, I gotta straighten out everything with Paulie or I'm dead."
Then you're better off staying in here.
They could whack me in here as easy as outside.
They're afraid I'll rat them out.
People are already walking away from me.
I'm dead in here.
You got to get me out.
Karen finally got her mother to put her house up for my bail and I was out.
I remember I had this feeling I was gonna get killed right outside the jail.
I knew Paulie was still pissed at me and he's such a hothead.
And I was worried about Jimmy.
"See, Jimmy knew if Paulie found out he was in the drug deals with me Paulie would have Jimmy whacked even before me."
This is the bad time.
I didn't feel safe until I got home.
"So, now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope the cops never found, then disappear until things got straightened out."
Fuck!
"Where's the stuff I left, Karen?"
I flushed it down the toilet.
You what?
What was I supposed to do?
They were all over the house.
"Hello, dear."
Are you all right?
"This is a terrible, terrible time for us, Michelangelo."
"Actually, I'm really not sure that you should still be here."
Poor Dorothy.
Poor Bonnie.
Even if she was a little difficult...
Well...
"She made the people in the backroom suffer, you see, at her fittings."
"The lateness, the screaming, the insults."
"She insulted me, too, often enough."
She had to have this and she had to have that.
Whatever you did was wrong.
"Whatever you paid her, it wasn't enough."
It was a nightmare.
"Of course, it was galling to think that in one day, a so-called day, she earned more than some workers earn in six months or even a year."
"It doesn't seem fair, does it?"
"Well, but then there she was the next day on the front pages."
"You know, dear, my father, he started this business from nothing."
My mother worked all hours.
They both did.
And I was their only child.
I wanted to go to law school.
I wanted to be a politician.
I wanted to change the world.
But how could I let them down?
I couldn't do that.
And now it all seems irrelevant.
Bonnie's family are flying in.
The whole thing is unbearable.
I can't even bear to talk about it.
Not even to you.
I was thinking of re-upping.
Nothing else you'd rather do?
No.
I was recruited by a software company in college.
The kind that makes apps for phones.
What's wrong?
Pay is no good?
"No, it was great, actually."
"Obscene, to be honest with you."
"Why didn't you do it, then?"
I don't know.
"I don't know, I guess I just felt like it was silly, it wasn't really that important, you know?"
I guess I like the idea of serving my country.
Even if I don't know exactly what it is I do.
What about you?
You never wanted to do anything else?
"There comes a time when you do a thing long enough, you can't really imagine doing anything else, you know?"
"So, if I stay here, I'm stuck with you forever?"
Yes.
Be careful what you wish for.
(laughing)
katherine:
"You're doing it again, aren't you?"
What?
You have that look that you get.
What look?
You're squinting one eye as if you're taking aim with a gun.
-You're gonna be late.
-lt's horrifying.
I'm sure you're great fun at parties.
"Seriously, you don't have to think about killing everyone that you ever meet."
-l don't.
You should be starting at the bottom.
"BOYD OUTPATIENT DIALYSIS CENTER 155 LAFAYETTE STREET WEDNESDAY, MARCH 16"
I'm number 37.
I've been waiting for five years.
But the sicker ones keep moving up the list past me.
"You having any problems, Carmen?"
Not yet.
But I'd like to get off this thing and have a life.
"In Peru, you can get a kidney in 48 hours."
People line up around the block to sell them.
Surprised you're not on a plane right now.
I would be.
If I had 100 grand to pay for transplant.
"Here, I'll probably die waiting."
"I've been waiting seven years, and I'm sick of nurses and doctors and hospitals and praying."
Man of your means has other options.
Buy a kidney?
No.
I've had a good life.
No regrets.
I'd rather leave the money to my grandchildren.
But you'd know where to go if you changed your mind.
Everybody does.
We used to talk about it all the time in my dialysis group.
Can you give us a name?
"I could, but it would only be a rumor."
And I don't necessarily believe it's wrong.
Then why didn't you do it?
Because we spent 90 grand on our wedding.
There's nothing left.
Now she's gonna die because I can't even afford to save her life.
Staying positive is better for Kyle.
Read that.
"You know, I'd like to say something big and brave right now but.."
I can't think of a thing.
How about this?
(Patricia) 'You may be down but not out.'
Sharp one.
Well.
"There's, um.."
"""They think they have me licked, but I'll show 'em."""
Here's one.
"""In the fell clutch of circumstance"
"""I have not winced nor cried aloud."
"""Under the bludgeonings of fate my head is bloody, but unbowed."""
Magnificent!
"You display a bit of histrionic talent there, my boy."
You should have been an actor.
"Of course, I perform best in my native surroundings."
"- You know, the open fields."
"- Oh, I hate the country."
- I'm afraid of wild flowers.
- Yes.
I've heard that one.
"Tell me, were you ever born in a big white house surrounded by a high green hedge?"
"With an orchard, a patch of woods and a natural spring."
- 'Yes.'
- No.
What?
No big house with little thatches growing all around it?
There's nothing like going out in the morning and picking yourself a nice fresh bunch of thatches.
"Boy, am I glad I got rid of that house."
"And now, you haven't a care in the world."
No.
I spent a fucking fortune on mine.
Did you?
I mean...
Have you been married once?
Twice.
Was that on the first one?
"No, I spent nothing on the first one."
I'm so relieved.
And I actually hope she's watching.
It should have been Vegas.
It would be actually easier to kill them.
Than get a divorce?
I like you.
I'm just saying that.
I'm not advocating killing anyone.
Sure you're not!
"I'm not saying that, but when you've been on the phone to British Gas for six hours,"
"""Just take his name off the fucking gas bill!"""
You just go...
"""I fucking killed him."
"I fucking shot him."""
That's what you want to say.
Do you know what I mean?
Can you tell us about your Top 30 hit?
"About seven years ago, I decided I wanted to try and have a hit in Ireland, but you don't want to be..."
"You don't have a Top 10 hit, because people will remember, cos I do music as part of my comedy."
"It might be one of the things like the Chicken Song, where people shout it at you for years to come."
For the rest of your life.
Yeah.
So I decided number 27 would be the correct number to aim for and February is the month where no-one buys singles.
"It used to be the month, anyway."
This is pre-downloads.
But you stuttered yesterday and the day before.
It was on one word.
It was on one stupid little word.
And you know what the word was?
Country.
Country.
And you know why I probably hit that word?
"It was because I was in the presence of Callie, who's a card-carrying c-c-cunt."
[chuckle]
Good for you.
You no longer have a speaking part in the trial.
"Okay, first of all, if I were to stutter in court, which I won't, but if I were, that would only serve to humanize me in front of the jury, which could run to the benefit"
of our very inhuman- and monstrous-seeming client.
"You put me on this case because I'm smart and I'm talented, and I have done great work, thanks to you."
"I've done it-- behind the scenes, maybe, but I-"
- I deserve to be seen doing it.
Shaken confidence does not serve the client or the firm.
My confidence is not shaken.
Mine is.
Come on.
I'm ready for this.
Let me do it.
Please.
You'll still be a valuable member of the team.
And a dear friend.
Are you breaking up with me?
[click]
- Good night.
- Good night.
Callie.
I hear you're back on top with Borns Tech.
Not surprising.
He must die in jealous.
And I must watch it.
What if our parents know it.
"I'll not tell, you too don't tell anyone."
I'll play with his life taking him to home.
"This bracelet was made in India, buyer's details are taken before selling it to them."
First find the jewellary shop.
"If you give this bracelet number, they will give the buyer's details."
"Kinsman, our children have agreed to marry, I'm very happy."
"Yes, I never felt so happy even when I made billions."
That's why I'm throwing this party.
"You said your son-in-law lives in Malaysia, where's he?"
They are also beautiful!
"Didn't I say, I'm Jiguru Jingania?"
"I didn't tell my name, right?"
'Run' Prakash Raj.
"Dear, didn't your short man come with you?"
What's this dad?
"All can't be tall like you, look down, dad."
"Have you come, son-in-law?"
"Why did you come so late, brother-in-law?"
What's this new get up?
That is...
"Kinsman, my son-in-law."
Nobody knows when I'll come.
Do you know why you're here?
Just a joke.
"Jokes apart, why did you change your name?"
That is...
"It seems you're here for a year, and refusing to go to India."
What's the matter?
I made an attempt to murder.
They kidnapped Amanda because they wanted something from him.
"And when he didn't give it, they killed her."
And he never told anyone.
You think the senator's going to make the same mistake?
"No, I'm not going to let him."
But he's holding back and I want to know why.
I hear you're having a lousy day.
Now is not the time.
"Before you get the wrong idea, I liked McNeal."
He was the first politician I covered and the last one who came out clean.
That's good.
Maybe you should put it in his obit.
Maybe I will... if you tell me why you were with him when he killed himself.
That's a good question;
"you come up with an answer, why don't you give me a call."
"Speaking of calls, do you care to comment on this one?"
"Mom, it's Sara;"
I need to talk to you.
About Jeffrey.
"It's important, so call me as soon as you can."
Where'd you get that?
We both met with Sara's parents.
I guess they liked me better.
They'll get over it.
"The Senator and Sara-- the marriage wasn't as perfect as everybody thought, was it?"
Off the record.
On the record.
No one's is.
"Ice machine's ready, Cap."
How 'bout you?
"Last beers, boys."
You're dating nothing but swordfish for the next three weeks.
Shoot him.
I've got a gun in my desk.
Last thing on my list would be to lie to my boss about it and then give the bastard everything he wanted.
I'm not here for foreman.
I'm here to save myself.
"Even with a needle stick, your chances of infection are pretty slim."
That's why you're wearing the suit.
You wanted to be here.
He just gave you the excuse.
What does that guy have to do to make you hate him?
Give me the bag.
Mildewed dish towel.
- To retest for staph.
"What is that, mouse droppings?"
Hamster droppings.
Could carry toxocara.
Explain the blindness.
"Now, that I recognize as oven crud."
Could be meat with trichinella.
Would explain the high fever.
What's with rye bread?
"Mold could be responsible for ergot poisoning, which would explain the contractures."
There are three loaves.
- So?
You're going back in there.
Guy who lives on take-out pizza does not buy three loaves of rye.
That's looking too far into the future.
Unless he cares about something a lot more than his diet.
You on the roof yet?
"Yeah, I'm here."
I don't see any birds.
Whistle or something.
"I'm quitting you and this, and, you know, all of this."
"Olive, you don't have to quit."
Calm down.
You want a drink?
"Lily, hand me your purse."
I'm not thirsty.
"I'm tendering my resignation and resigning my tenders to the cold, harsh reality of what's not meant to be."
But you can't just leave.
"Vivian, go wait outside."
- But...
- Haven't you caused enough trouble?
This is your home.
Where will you go?
I know a place.
Aunt Vivian used to always say there's nothing sadder than an empty birdcage.
Is Olive ever gonna come home?
She didn't say.
"She said her apartment was paid to the end of the year, and she asked me to water her plants."
I feel like I broke her.
I enlisted her to spy on my aunts and then turned her into a homeopathic drug mule.
What homeopathic drugs was she muling?
I baked antidepressants into pies to get them out of the house.
"It's something I've always wanted to do, but never had the chance."
I guess it worked.
I got them out of the house.
Olive got them out of the house.
They got out of the house.
"I mean, Vivian took the bus."
She never takes the bus.
She thinks it's too intimate.
I wish there was a way I could thank Olive.
You know today's my first day at Betty's Bees?
They did it by mail.
- Mail?
-That's right.
"Little love notes between our security officer and von Scherbach with Schulz, the mailman."
Here's the flag.
They used to put a loop in the cord.
Did you ever notice?
And here's the mailboxes.
Hollow black queens.
"Cute, huh?"
"They delivered the mail or picked it up when we were out of the barracks, like for appell."
"And when there was a special delivery they'd pull a phony air raid to get us out like last night, for instance."
There wasn't a plane in the sky.
"Or was there, Price?"
"Brother, were we all wet about you."
Forget it.
What are we gonna do with him?
Don't you know?
Because I got my own ideas.
Let's have that civilian stuff.
"I'll look pretty stupid in this, yodeling my way across the alps."
"Now, let's have the wire cutters."
- You taking Dunbar?
-You betcha.
There ought to be some reward money from mama.
"Say about 10,000 bucks worth."
"I told you boys, I'm no escape artist."
"For the first time, I like the odds, because now I got me a decoy."
- What's the decoy?
-Price.
When I go I want you to give me five minutes.
Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank.
"Soon-shin, talk to me!"
What went wrong?
"Why, sir?"
I must know why you made such an unfair decision?
Are you really oblivious as to why you failed?
Ask your father.
How dare you even think to apply for the exam!
There is no place for descendents of traitors in the royal court?
Good hunting today.
"Here, it's your share."
"I was the lead today, isn't that right?"
Then my share is larger than that.
"Why are you sitting out here, wife?"
"Oh, you're back."
"It's been months since the exam, and Shoo-shin is yet to find peace."
I'm concerned.
Will he ever be all right?
One must hit the bottom to bounce back.
He must undergo what he must.
Let's just watch him.
I shouldn't have encouraged him.
I had resented you.
A part of me was angry with you for not allowing the boys to pursue their studies.
And I had hopes.
I believed that someone in this world would give my boy a chance... that their spirit and talent would be recognized...
Innkeeper!
Innkeeper!
Bring me more wine!
More wine!
I'm coming!
Stop this now.
Stop!
"And then there was Mo Black's brother, Fat Andy."
"And his guys, Frankie the Wop and Freddy No Nose."
"And then there was Pete the Killer, who was Sally Balls' brother."
Then you had Nickey Eyes and Mikey Franzese.
"Jimmy Two-Times, who got that nickname because he said everything twice."
"I'm gonna go get the papers, get the papers."
What is this?
Coats?
"I need suits, Henry, not coats."
Suits are up on Thursday.
"I know, but this is the middle of the fucking summer."
What am I gonna do with fur coats?
You don't want furs?
I'll take the furs away.
"No, don't take them away, I want them."
We'll hang them in the freezer with the meat.
How's that?
"For us, to live any other way was nuts."
"To us, those goody-good people who worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks and took the subway to work every day and worried about bills, were dead."
They were suckers.
They had no balls.
"If we wanted something, we just took it."
"If anyone complained twice, they got hit so bad, believe me, they never complained again."
It was just all routine.
You didn't even think about it.
"Frankie, what the fuck does 520 have to do with 469?"
520 ain't even close to 469.
What he fuck does that got to do with anything?
Piece of cake.
It's all there.
Don't worry about the alarms. I just gotta find a way to get the key.
-No problems?
In her purse.
At the bar.
"Jules, I know I'm not like her."
I just...
I wanna be a great mom so bad that...
I'm afraid I'm never gonna be able to have fun again.
Of course you can.
Just because you have a kid doesn't mean you have to change who you are.
All you have to do is...
Girl: - [ Giggles ] Let's go dance.
Girl #2:
- Yeah!
Trust your instincts.
Mm.
"Laurie, you're a mom."
And not just because you have a baby.
It's because of who you are and the love that you have in your heart.
I've seen the way you hold him.
"And even when you go out and you get a little crazy, the thing you're gonna be most excited about is to get home and see your son."
All my mom ever wanted to do at the end of the night was go to an airport hotel and see if any hair bands were staying there.
She once took her top off in a hot tub and caused a fistfight between Kip Winger and the lead singer of Quiet Riot.
Please don't tell me that you--
Poolside in her purse.
"If I close my eyes, I can still hear them arguing."
"My God, she was not a great mom."
"It sounded like she had great boobs, though."
- She did.
- Mm.
"But you're right, Jules."
"The end of tonight, the thing that I am most looking forward to is getting home and being with my baby."
I know.
- Come here.
Buy it!
"It will save you time and money, it'll save both because time is money!"
"You can't tie a tube around your neck each morning, that's impossible!"
You need this completely prepared thing.
If there is anything that the Dawes Plan didn't take it's your head... and it should tell you that you need this.
"Well, ladies and gentlemen, buy this, buy!"
You'll purchase cheap and genuine here.
"1 piece 20, 3 pieces 50."
Look!
It doesn't tear or grind nor break.
"Don't laugh, ladies and gentlemen, don't laugh."
I just wanted to show how unbreakable such a small piece can be.
"1 piece 20, 3 pieces 50!"
Buy this really genuine piece!
Buy!
How nice that you showed up here!
"- Wait a moment, I gotta get my stuff."
- I'll wait right here.
"Franz, you'd make a great dad."
A man needs a daughter and a son.
Why not?
Would you mind?
You're not getting anywhere.
Just wait and see.
Others are off much worse with their jobs or locked up in Tegel.
"What is it, girl?"
You can sit in a warm and dry place and do whatever you please.
I got something for you.
What do you have?
Nice.
- Where did you get all this?
- Thrift store.
"Phan, where you been hiding?"
"Over in Maui, chilling."
Bought a piece of golf course.
Get out of here.
What?
You get a couple of holes.
"- Come over, I'll take care of you."
- I'm coming at Christmas.
"I saw you were in the shooting in Seattle, so I thought I better get back, keep an eye on business."
"There's something going on, we don't know what."
Bob's got a theory.
Will you stop it with that!
You create this atmosphere of paranoia.
It's ridiculous.
"If it's real, it ain't paranoia."
"Get hip to what's in the air, it's called atmosphere."
You can smell it.
You can taste it.
"Come on, you can see it."
You're scaring me.
We're just talking about this American crew trying to make a push.
- I'm hearing the same thing.
"- So, what about these Americans?"
Couple of guys were round my place when I was gone.
Americans trying to buy whatever weed I had available.
I heard that maybe you were gonna get out of the business.
"Yeah, we've been talking about it."
"So, do I get a chance to buy a piece of it?"
- Make an offer?
- Maybe.
- What piece do you want?
- The contacts out of the East.
Like you'd say to somebody:
"""You'll like this guy."
He's all right.
"He's a goodfella, he's one of us."""
You understand?
We were goodfellas.
Wiseguys.
But Jimmy and I could never be made because we had Irish blood.
It didn't matter my mother was Sicilian.
"To become a member of a crew, you've got to be 100% Italian so they can trace your relatives back to the old country."
It's the highest honor they can give you.
It means you belong to a family and a crew.
It means nobody can fuck around with you.
It also means you could fuck around with anybody just as long as they aren't also a member.
It's like a license to steal.
A license to do anything.
How many years ago since you were made?
- I'm an old-timer. 30 years ago.
- Thirty years?
Brings back a lot of memories.
"Pike's Peak was a pimple then, wasn't it?"
"As far as Jimmy was concerned, with Tommy being made it was like we were all being made."
We would now have one of our own as a member.
- Who's this?
- This is Vinnie.
Vinnie.
What happened?
Did we get straightened out?
"No, we had a problem."
We tried to do everything we could.
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
Wow drama in a wedding that's shocking.
Yeah well Jill wants this chapel filled with eight thousand red roses and some like...
Eighty thousand dollar wedding dinner and seven thousand dollar wedding dress.
And her dad won't cover the entire tab.
Wow I'm very glad that I'm not Drew right now.
Or her dad.
"Yeah but that's just Jill, you know?"
Only love her for it she's extravagant.
You know I've known her since I was eleven.
We went to boarding school together.
You went to boarding school when you were eleven.
Did you miss your parents a lot?
Yeah... it's complicated.
When did you get home to see them?
"Well on the holidays, or you know the occasional odd long weekend."
I liked boarding school.
It was what I needed.
How do you mean?
Well my parents died when I was a kid.
I told you that right?
No I'm very sorry I didn't know that.
How did they die together?
No they actually died separately.
Um my was when I was 5.
My mom when I was 11.
"Oh no, no, no it's not sad."
It was a really long time ago.
I just don't talk about it much because...
Um what about your parents?
They're... still together right?
"Still together yeah, after 30 years."
And totally in love with each other.
He's opening up about himself.
Maybe.
"We need to verify what he's saying, though."
Speak.
"Garcia, I need you to check something for me."
I'm looking for a stray bombing in a bazaar somewhere in Egypt approximately 30 years ago.
"Okay, great."
That's not too obscure.
I don't need you to give me details.
We're just trying to set a baseline for Jind Allah's truthfulness.
- I need to know if it happened at all.
"- When I know, you'll know."
- Thank you.
- When the rubble was cleared... half... of my family was dead.
It was on that day that I swore my life to vengeance for Allah.
"And for that very reason, those holding you here can never let you leave."
Your only hope is to tell me so I can hopefully one day share your struggle with the world.
Your government won't even admit that I exist.
How possibly can you tell my side of the story?
"Hey, guys, we want silence tonight."
No coms.
Let's be careful.
We don't know what to expect.
- Ready?
- Ready.
Let's do it.
Clear!
This place is completely empty.
We missed them again.
"You got Gideon, Prentiss, and me."
It's Hotch.
We're at cell location number 2.
Suppose we take a little drive this afternoon and make further inquiries.
- I guess we'll learn something.
"- Hello, hello!"
How are you today?
Why did you run away?
- Sorry.
I don't think we've met.
- Nonsense.
Of course.
- You spent last night with me.
- This lady says she doesn't know you.
"Yes, she does."
You mustn't forget old friends so soon.
Most unflattering.
I haven't the slightest idea who you are.
You can't have forgotten Brighton and my brother.
- Never been to Brighton.
"- Well, makes us even."
I haven't a brother.
You're evidently making a mistake.
This lady spent last night with her aunt.
Don't you think you ought to apologize and leave us?
"Well, if that's the way you see it, I'll toddle off and give it thought."
"I say, what's that dreadful thing you're playing?"
"- They call it ""The March of the Hussars. """
- Nothing like it.
"It so happens, my bovine friend, that ""The March of the Hussars"" is my favorite piece of music."
"I know every note of it, and you haven't played one of them."
"Well, how does it go then?"
Those are the drums.
Play it.
Those are the trumpets.
"Yes, one."
From which point at the airport will we shoot it down?
Only I know that.
"That way, none of you can betray our plan."
Our friend Silveira knows many ways of loosening silent men's tongues.
I know that all too well.
- But what if they arrest you?
- Then the plan falls through.
They're at the gate.
- That's definitely the president's car.
- No doubt about it.
The information was correct.
Ramírez is here.
- Can you hear me?
- Loud and clear.
We've received an encoded message saying that the plane will land on runway 3.
I will disrupt the electricity at the end of the runway for 20 seconds.
- Stand by.
- All right.
We must get to that sewer over there.
"If he doesn't manage to cut off the electricity, that's it."
Exactly.
That would be it.
Sánchez Granstev.
- Hello.
I'd just like to check something.
- Is anything wrong?
"No, everything's fine."
There just seems to be a minor problem with the transformer.
We'll have it fixed in no time at all.
It will only take a few minutes.
I'll go back to my post.
- Is that not okay?
"- It is, but I might have a date."
"Well, what do you want me to do?"
Should I cancel our trip so you can go on the date you might have?
"No, obviously you should go."
- What's that sound?
"- I don't know, Rob."
- You should be in bed.
- Mom?
That always happens at this time.
You just were never up this early.
"It's the lights, Robby."
See these street lights?
They're run by a big computer that tells them when to go on and off.
That's what that sound is.
"So, forthe purpose of this role-play, Shamus is holding a grenade."
"The juice is a grenade, so the worst thing we can do is act afraid."
"Because Shamus is already scared, and he's taking his cues from us."
We will want to exit in an orderly fashion... telling Shamus with our actions... that he cannot get our attention in this inappropriate manner.
Hey.
Hi.
"So, do you have anything new in the chest?"
"You know, the hope chest?"
- What's the hope chest?
- It's... nothing.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Ellen broke up with me.
What?
Why?
She thinks she's gonna die this week.
No.
"Out of everyone at Saint Tod, she is the least likely person to die."
Okay.
"Look, you stay out of Vegas, and we'll be fine."
"Come now, Samantha."
"If your clients are truly happy, then I pose no threat."
"But when your service is less than exemplary, like with Mr. Harpel there, who I'm sure would have met you at the appointed time... had you only picked him up yourself in a jet, as I did,"
then you become vulnerable to competition.
"Oh, see, now you don't have to teach me how to service my clients."
I happen to be the number one host in Las Vegas.
A meaningless distinction.
What?
"You might be number one at the moment, but you've never had to compete with the best."
"Now that I'm here, you won't be on top for long."
Wanna bet?
A friendly wager might be in order.
Hmm.
What do you propose?
I bet that I can bring in more money than you can in the next 24 hours.
"And we'll even do it on your home turf, the Montecito."
Nice.
And the winner would say that she...
Or he.
Would be Vegas's best.
Why don't we make it interesting?
Please.
"Winner gets bragging rights, loser leaves town."
Deal?
Deal.
[Chattering]
Hey.
Is that the infamous Paul Logan I see at blackjack 22?
Yep.
He seems so...
"You know, the passports were a gift from me."
"Least you could do is cover my shift, you rat bastard."
Thought you were gonna ask carter.
I was.
I did.
She acted like I was waving a sock in front of her face.
I'm sure you were polite and respectful as always.
"You sweet on her, sousa?"
Don't you have enough women in your life to worry about?
"All right, I'm gonna give you"
"A nickel's worth of free advice, pal."
"No girl's gonna trade in a red, white, and blue shield"
For an aluminum crutch.
Your knowledge of waste removal rather surprises me.
I spent a week down here in the winter of '42.
It was...
"another time, perhaps."
"After all, we all have secrets."
I was wrong.
I need to know.
Miss carter...
"If we're going to be working together,"
"Risking our lives together,"
Then I must be able to trust you.
"On my honor, you can."
Your honor is not enough.
Mr. Stark deemed me worthy of his trust.
I would hope that would suffice.
Mr. Stark would trust a shark to not bite him
If it was wearing a short enough skirt.
That's not entirely relevant.
Would it satisfy you to know
- What did Mr. Somers say to that?
"Told me to help myself, that they'd all be looking for a job next morning."
I told him that Axel would blow his top.
"I think that'll be all, sir."
Thank you.
Cross-examine.
Just where at the Somers factory did this conversation take place?
"Well, it was in the parking lot that I ran into him, actually."
You share a common parking lot with Somers' factory?
"No, no, of course not."
Then how did you know you'd be able to reach him there?
I called him at his office.
They said he'd be leaving.
- You called from where?
- From my home.
"- Really, I don't see--"
- You went home and then you decided?
"No, no, I'd gone home for an early bite because I knew I had to come back to the office that evening."
It was on my way.
"Really, Your Honor, I don't see--"
"May it please the court, I ask permission at this time to recall a witness."
"Yes, Axel told me to put in calls long distance-- one for you and one for Mr. Hadley."
"The call to Mr. Hadley, what time was that?"
Right after you hung up.
About 8?
8:30?
Was the call completed?
No.
"The phone rang and rang, but no answer."
All right.
So I drove up to the Valley.
It was there at the motel that I spoke to Somers.
"I will sit here, but I am not supposed to be anywhere near this woman."
Why?
I've taken out a restraining order on her because she will not leave me alone.
What are you talking about?
"It's phone calls, it's faxes, it's emails."
You have got to get it in your head it is never going to happen!
APPLAUSE
"If she promises not to bother you, will you join us?"
Don't touch me!
I won't.
"Now, I have to ask you..."
"Sarah, Sarah..."
Let's not involve the authorities.
You're winding me up.
Whoa!
The first thing I have to ask you is what's in your bag?
"Well, in the bag tonight, I've got all sorts of rubbish."
I've got...
I've got this which is me.
So you don't get recognised?
"I just bung it on people's faces like that, then I've got some idea of what it's like to talk to me."
LAUGHTER It's good fun.
"Now then, I know you through Vic and Bob."
Yes.
How are they?
I don't know.
I don't see them.
We do not socialise outside of the show because I have not forgiven them for tricking me into doing it in the first place.
How have you been celebrating Christmas?
What would be a typical Christmas for you?
I would celebrate Christmas usually with me family.
With me mum and me dad and me four brothers -
"I'm starving, too."
There's probably something in here.
Karen's ziti?
It's the last one she made.
And it was like 300 degrees in that Minnie Mouse head?
"So I took it off, you know?"
I was gonna have a cigarette.
- And some kid took a picture of me.
"- Come on, girls."
These gentlemen have things to discuss.
Let's go.
Okay.
Thanks.
- Nice meeting you guys.
- We'll see you at the bar later.
"Look, Carmine."
You basically know what's going on with your dad and Johnny... and us over in Jersey.
"First let me say, I understand."
I appreciate the respect you're showing me by coming here... and reaching out to me at this time.
Always.
I will also go on record as saying...
I know my old man can be a tough nut to crack.
"I don't want to crack nuts, but I will."
I feel the anger.
"When I try, for the second time... on a separate issue entirely, to reach an accommodation... and he don't even make a counteroffer, where's his respect?"
I don't know what kind of advice he's getting from Johnny.
Johnny's always usually a voice of moderation.
"Me and him, we get along good."
"So, all due respect, let's not jump in and blame Johnny."
True.
John's a pragmatist.
But he's also a greedy motherfucker.
"If the d.A. Finds out ann dated him,"
He'll use it to make ann look like a prostitute.
Don't worry about al stirling.
I'll take care of him.
"I said we'd get paid for this case,didn't i?"
"Alden, handle the physical evidence."
See if the knife wounds are consistent with self-Defense.
I'd rather work with ann.
Her testimony will be our whole case.
"No,do the scientific evidence."
You do that better than anybody.
"Besides, you think she's a hooker."
"No,i don't,ron."
I've seen her place.
I think she's just a college girl that goes out
"With rich men so she doesn't feel like a loser... and she's hiding a gawky past, which i understand."
I've been that.
Okay.
Let alden take ann.
I'll take the physical stuff.
Ann's parents are coming in from nebraska.
I hate the families.
You handle 'em.
I'm going to see al.
"That was nice, him pardoning you,al."
"Well,if you'd handled my tax case,"
I wouldn't have been convicted.
"I told you, ""stop stealing from people."
"But if you're going to steal, pay your taxes."""
"It was free advice, but did you listen?"
So you know ann diggs.
I took her to some laker games.
Keep it to yourself till you die.
For me.
Should I not say it?
What's wrong?
It's no crime to date them...
Changwook will not take this well.
- Did you date them?
- Yes.
How many?
I've had maybe two or three serious ones.
- That's quite a lot.
- I told you not to say anything!
I was lonely.
"Yeah, they love Asian women."
They just go crazy about them.
Even if the women are ugly.
It's not necessarily like that.
But there's a premium if they go there.
Not many Asian women in Europe.
Western men have a fantasy about them.
Many Korean men seem to think so.
"Frankly, it's rather a disgrace."
Unpopular women here are considered pretty over there.
Don't you think it's a disgrace?
"Well, that's not how I feel."
Look here.
It's a person meeting another.
It's not like what you said.
"Oh, you might think that I have an inferiority complex about my dick size compared to Western men, but that's not it."
"You have to live where you were born, whether you're ugly or not."
Why do unpopular girls here go over there to live comfortably?
That's really not cool!
He's not like any Mokra I've ever met.
I can't believe he'll really help us.
"If there's any chance for a diplomatic solution, we have to pursue it."
"In the meantime, I want continuous scans of the surface."
Standard search pattern.
I advise caution.
There's a control circuit there.
I can see it.
"If only we knew that Neelix made it back to the ship with the tellerium, then at least this would be worth it."
I regret I have no such reassurance to offer you.
We don't even know what happened to the Captain.
She might have been killed out there on the street.
That is possible.
It is also possible that she has safely returned to Voyager.
We have insufficient evidence to dismiss either conclusion.
I guess thas the Vulcan way of telling me to hope for the best.
Look who's awake.
Just rest.
You must be thirsty.
Maybe hungry?
For a little something?
"Oh, what shall I make?"
"What, what can I make?"
"What, what?"
Oh...
Where am I?
"Oh, it hasn't been that long."
I wish I had some...
There.
This will do.

- To drink.
""" Pete, don't worry about it. """
You weren't the first licensed practioner that sleeps with one of your patients and you won't be the last.
"Besides, you're single."
Let it go.
"But then , just when he was almost over with the guilt and all, another voice would bring him back down to reality and said, "" Oh Pete , but dude, you're a veterinarian! """
Vi !
Let's go !
What are you doing ?
I don't get it.
Don't get what ?
What's so funny about the vegetarians ?
I don't get it .
You mean the veterinarian man ?
"Yea, that guy."
I don't get it .
He sleeps with his patients .
His patients are probably cats and dogs and llamas and stuff.
Why is that funny?
Back home we had puppy dogs and kitty cats
I used to nap with all the time.
I think it's sweet.
"Actually, don't worry about it , partner."
There're plenty of other jokes in the universe that we can share .
Let's just get ready for tonight.
Some well deserved vacation.
"I got a good one for you, Violet ."
Lay it on me!
Oh damn!
What?
I think I forgot it .
"But that's the good thing, Daze;"
I'll be here when it comes back to you .
Right.
What were you doing there in the first place?
"She had called the office looking for me, so I was just following up."
I see.
So you didn't actually speak with her?
No.
No.
Bad timing.
I assume she had something to tell me about the trial or her testimony.
- So it's not a total loss.
"Not to be insensitive, but it is lucky you found her body when you did."
"I'm looking into the possibility of a mistrial or better yet, if the police find anything suspicious,"
I'll argue for the charges to be dropped altogether.
"So good work, Danny."
That's not why I brought you in here.
Rodriguez bank robbery case?
- It's yours.
I thought Burke was handling it.
- He was.
Now you are.
- Burke was first chair.
"Danny, you've earned it."
Plain and simple.
Now get out of my office before I change my mind.
"Yes, sir."
Thank you.
I will not let you down.
I bet you won't.
"But that is a big case, so you better get to work."
I'll have Burke bring the case files to your office.
"Thank you, sir."
"Danny, that's wonderful."
Was that fight was about you?
"I didn't want to tell Caleb over the phone, but... he called right after he got off the ship, and he wanted to come over, and I said no."
What time was that?
"Just after 11:30, I think."
I told him I was sorry.
"I didn't mean to hurt him, but I couldn't help how I felt."
I told him I was in love with Brian.
And he... lost it.
"Next thing I know, Caleb's dragging me behind some store."
Starts pounding on me.
"I fought back for a little bit, and finally, I pushed him off me, then I ran."
Never saw him again.
Then where'd you go?
"Walked around for a while, cleared my head."
Got to Meredith's around 6:00.
That was seven hours after the fight.
You just walked around clearing your head?
"Caleb was my best friend, all right?"
I would never hurt him.
"We grew up together, went fishing every weekend."
We were practically brothers.
"Look, I know I'm a bad person for betraying Caleb that way."
But I didn't kill him.
The last time Caleb called he was rambling.
"Saying that he was gonna win me back, buy me a ring."
He sounded so out of it.
He was slurring like he'd been drinking.
Caleb hardly ever drank.
And that was the last time you spoke?
I can't believe
I'm never gonna hear his voice again.
"Meredith, look at me."
"- No, Ben, it's safe."
Very safe.
You think you can beat the system?
"This is the system, beating you back."
"You wanna count cards, you do it in Atlantic City."
- Get him up.
"- Come on, kid."
Count to five.
- Count to five!
- What?
"Count to five so I know you don't have brain damage, you can go home."
Start with one.
"One, two, three, four, five."
Good.
"Now, stop counting."
Let's go.
"You're crazy, everybody knows to split eights."
My grandmother splits eights.
Not against a 10.
It's a sucker play.
"Look, you're choosing to play two hands against the highest up card a dealer can have, right?"
"Against a five or a six, it'd be fine."
"Against a 10 or an ace, it's a sucker play."
"Yeah, Kianna, save it, all right?"
Jill's right.
All right?
"Choi, why don't you explain to Ben how we do?"
"Oh, all right."
"So, our team is divided into two kinds of players, spotters and big players, right?"
"So if you think that this table is the casino floor, then salt and pepper shakers are your spotters."
Spotters are just sitting at the various blackjack tables and they're betting the table minimum.
They never fluctuate their bet.
"Now, I think we..."
"and by ""we"", I mean the two of you..."
Might be able to find something on there that'll give us a lead to find his West Coast counterpart.
"Rick, we need to talk."
About what?
I'll give you two the room.
[Door closes]
You remember when we first met?
How could I forget?
You sucker-punched me in the face.
No.
"No, we'd met before that."
"A year and a half earlier, to be precise."
You mean this whole time you knew?
Who the hell are you?
I'm Hayley.
Didn't lie about that.
"Technically, I didn't lie about anything."
"I misrepresented, sure, but I-I didn't lie."
But why?
"Because a year and a half ago, you asked me to."
"In fact, you begged."
I don't understand.
"So ages ago, I did some freelance work for MI-6, and I met an American spy on an op."
"He was an older gentleman, very handsome, smart as a whip."
My father.
Jackson Hunt.
"Year and a half ago, he calls me, asks me to keep an eye out on you here in L.A."
Said you were sticking your nose where it didn't belong.
What did he say I was doing?
"[Sighs] I didn't ask, he didn't say."
"But I do know that after your two weeks in Thailand, your undercover mission for the CIA was over and you were supposed to go home."
It won't change the way I feel.
"I've tried steroids, fluid restriction."
Nothing's working.
Neuro says he's not a surgical candidate.
I'm gonna take Tammy into surgery now.
Okay.
How's she doing?
She'll be fine.
"Yeah, physically, but she will not forgive herself, and nothing I said was gonna get her... you guys think that when we die,"
"There's like a bookkeeper, and he tallies up everything we did... all the lives we saved, all the people we helped, and if we've done enough good in the world, that it makes up for the times that we just completely fail?"
No.
I don't think anyone's keeping score.
"I think we do what we can, we hope for the best, and that's all anybody can do, right?"
"I think, uh, I think that we..."
"we do what we can do when we know how to do it, and it hurts."
It just... it hurts.
Violet's in the kitchen.
Hello.
Hi.
Come here.
Hi.
Yes.
Yeah.
Hmm.
"So I have this 11-year-old patient, stabbed her father."
"Turns out she has a pheochromocytoma, which made her... aggressive."
"Um, Addison's gonna remove it, but this girl just can't forgive herself."
Maybe she needs more time.
Time?
So should I offer her time?
"Well, what do you want, Cooper, a magic pill?"
Bad things happen.
- We were miserable together.
"- Yes, I kind of feel that way myself you know, Marie and I."
"See a couple of months ago, we had this big set- to and I moved out for a couple of days."
And I just found that--
I just couldn't imagine being separated.
"But I think I gotta really try to imagine it even with the kids, because we're really unhappy."
I'm not telling you it's easy.
It's not.
I'm not having a great time.
"With you, there were no kids involved."
"That's true, and I do miss her."
"But the interesting thing is, I found out a lot about myself."
"I mean, it doesn't make you happy."
Divorce doesn't make you happy.
"But in a weird way, it's made me eligible to be happy more than I ever have been in my life."
Does that make sense?
Yeah.
"I don't know if that will help you or what, but...."
Yeah.
It helps a lot.
"- Thanks, John."
- Yeah.
[COUGHING ]
You gotten the cold from hell yet?
- Maybe after we've spent time together.
- Let's get through this.
- They'll hit us hard on probable cause.
- Let's do it.
"On October 7, did you have occasion to arrest Julio Ortiz?"
- I did.
COSTAS:
Tell us the circumstances.
"No, there's no time."
"- Listen, I need a favor."
- What?
I need money.
How much money you talking about?
$2 million in cash.
"How about I throw in a Ferrari, man?"
"I'm serious, Isaac."
"Don't matter if you are, I don't have it."
Is there anyone else you know who might have the money?
"Well, ain't nobody got more money than the cops, so try them."
They busted a big heroin deal last week.
I heard they ceased 100 kilos and the money for the buy.
They got $4 million in cash.
"All right, so where would the cops be keeping the money?"
"No, I wasn't being serious."
"Where, Isaac?"
It's at the main precinct on Third.
"It's probably in some evidence lockers, but, look, ain't no way you're getting it out of there."
"Yeah, we'll see about that."
"No, look listen, listen."
"That money is surrounded by a hundred cops, all right?"
All kinds of security down there.
"Isaac, I got no other options, man."
So Nicole was right.
What?
"She, um, said you've been having issues since you got out the army."
That you're not happy.
She told you that?
Yeah.
"She thinks you miss what you was doing over there,"
"All the fighting, killing or whatever."
- Officer.
- Come on.
"Let's go, will you?"
"No, wait a minute."
What seems to be the trouble?
"Good morning, sir."
"Officer, this man stole a quarter from my purse."
Make him give it back.
"Now, miss, does he look like a man who would steal quarters?"
- That's just what I said to the lady.
- Imagine...
I don't care what you think he looks like.
I know he stole my quarter.
"Now you run along, sister... before I run you in for disturbing the peace."
"But, Officer, he took my..."
That'll be enough.
"Run along now, you're obstructing traffic."
"Why, you Cossack."
"Officer, you had no right to speak to that little girl that way."
I suppose you're going to tell me what my duty is.
"Not at all, but..."
"Listen, guys like you pay me to protect them from screwy dames."
"That's fine, but in this instance I'm sure you were wrong."
So now I'm wrong.
You ought to thank me for what I've done.
"- All right, thank you."
- All right.
What did you say?
"I said, look out for the great big ditch."
"Pop, why didn't you tell me you had it?"
In front of the cop?
I would've been accused of stealing it.
"Amy, you are going to love the kitchen, but first I'm going to show you guys the living room."
It has a wall-mounted flat screen and a gas log fireplace.
You won't believe how easy this is.
One push of a button...
Isn't that cozy?
"Make sure you capture the back of his head, too."
- If you would be so kind.
- You got it.
-Sorry.
- Sorry.
"There's no rush, gentlemen."
Our patient isn't going anywhere.
"I don't know, Ducky, the old Gibbs is back."
The old Gibbs?
"McGee, over here."
Hands and knees.
On the floor.
"Okay, um..."
"You're not going to step on me, are you?"
Footprints.
It's a pretty tight weave.
Looks like sisal.
It's a naturally stiff fiber woven from the leaf of a cactus plant.
"It doesn't mat, trap dust, build static."
Makes it ideal for carpeting.
"Personally, I prefer a good shag."
From a criminal-investigative standpoint.
I don't see any dirty footprints.
I think it's safe to assume that our friend didn't stroll in here on his own.
"You look happy to see me, boss."
"Oh, the coffee."
Ran the military ID our local LEO's got off the body.
"He came down here Monday morning, asking for something to match his skin tone."
He didn't tell me what it was for.
"Well, we just left him."
His hands are pale.
"His face is, uh... tan."
- Which tone were you trying to match?
- More tan.
And he wanted it waterproof.
Waterproof to cover a wound?
Maybe it's not for nothing he's wearing a turtleneck.
We need to find someone who's seen him without his shirt on.
Unless you wanna take a shvitz with him.
They don't pay me enough.
So you do Gillian Booth's makeup?
- She always looks so radiant.
"- Oh, thanks."
Sad to think of her alone at a time like this.
The maestro must be a big help.
I know he was in her dressing room Sunday night.
Philip was the first friend I called.
He came right away.
"So Philip's a special friend, isn't he?"
Did he spend the night with you?
"Well, it's only natural that you wouldn't want to be alone with your grief, right?"
"Well, if that's what you mean... yes."
He held me while I cried.
We fell asleep.
Did you happen to notice if he had any wounds or scratches?
On him?
"What, you think we were naked?"
"I might have been very vulnerable, but Philip is no cretin."
All he did was encourage me to talk about Laura.
Don't get close to me!
"If you do, I'll jump!"
Miss.
Please move away from there.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Let go of me.
Will you be responsible if she jumps?
Don't come close!
What's the problem this time?
No one loves an ugly girl like me.
I have to die!
I understand how you feel.
But how could you throw your beautiful body into such a sewage-infested river?
But you put me into a box and humiliated me.
I wanted to start a new life in the circus.
"All I do is eat and sleep, so I've gained weight."
"Look, do you know how many people envy you?"
Why?
Because you're human.
Being human is a special right.
You know how many things try so hard to be human?
A werewolf.
A vampire.
And that's not all.
Even foxes.
"Yes, even foxes."
"In order to be human, they've withstood other's mockery, being called a goblin or monster."
"They've endure so much for a long time, almost 1000 years."
But you're giving up your humanity merely because of your appearance?
You know how precious your life is?
And you have one thing you have left to do.
"You need to fall in love before you die, right?"
"Your Honor, it would take two years to go through all the discovery they dumped on us,"
"Plus, I'm dealing with this police matter right now."
It is not my concern.
My concern is this case.
You're not getting two years to try this case.
"I'm not asking for that, Your Honor."
"Listen, this case either moves forward, or it stops."
"It's time to either put up or shut up, counsel."
What's it going to be?
"Did you hear me, sir?"
"Yes, sir, I heard you."
Put up or shut up.
The plaintiff chooses put up.
- I beg your pardon?
- [click]
We call ready for trial.
[whisper] What are you doing?
[whispering]
"We're not ready for trial, Your Honor."
Why not?
You've got about a million lawyers working on this.
- [scoff]
- I call ready for trial.
"This is a dangerous game you're playing, Mr. McBride."
You haven't gone through the discoveries.
You haven't deposed their witnesses.
"Well, I have a pretty good idea what they're gonna all say."
Judge:
Do I understand this correctly?
"You're ready to proceed to trial now, today."
"Yes, sir, that's correct."
- Miss Senate?
"Besides, I need you."
You're the one who's going to tell me where Doug is.
Oh.
Here.
Your car is in the campground parking lot.
What are we gonna do to resolve our problem?
"Well, I think our problems are a little different, but, yes, let's resolve them."
"You know, you and I have a very special connection."
- I'm not even sure who I'm talking to.
"- Oh, we met... in a manner of speaking."
"Istanbul, about six years ago."
July.
Seven years ago.
You took out those two diplomats.
Yes.
You know how close you came to catching me?
That was impressive.
"And ever since then, I've kept tabs on you."
You might say I've become a fan.
"I heard you got burned, and I got this gig in Miami, so... the stars just kind of lined up."
I like the new look.
And your bruise- it healed.
Yeah.
"Well, that was temporary."
I've been studying up on you.
"It's not easy with someone as secretive as you are, but, uh... of course, things got a lot easier when you got burned."
- Not classified material anymore.
- Lucky you.
I learned something about your early years.
Your daddy was mean.
Mmm.
"So I figured an abusive husband and a troubled but gifted son- well, that would be motivating."
Yes.
The evenings are the most beautiful ones at us.
There is not warmth at this time.
And the blackout?
"Ow, oh my God!"
Do not have yourselves disturbed.
Go to bed.
I am a bad sleeping.
Well it because of that maybe not.
"Appropriate, that we wait for it, the major lord falls asleep."
Why is this girl so sly?
It is not possible to get used to it.
What is an idea under the piano.
"Ow, Gyula."
There is warmth here after all.
"Open it a little the door, Ágika."
what's up dear Tót?
How do you feel?
"Thank you, very well, respectable major lord."
I envy you.
You have lucky nature.
Tell Tót.
Would you not play chess with me?
"Major lord, I am really sorry for it, but i can't."
And a card game?
"I am ashamed of it very much major lord, but..."
I not know the cards.
Then we play with dominos.
"Respectable major lord, I...not know any kind of board game."
Tell it quite openly.
Do you not miss something for you if you are this here sit with your wife and your daughter in a beautiful night?
My pipe was made of the sour cherry tree only.I lost it somewhere unfortunately.
He wants to destroy the whole world.
Unalaq is gonna destroy the world?
He really does have a doomsday device?
"He's trying to release a powerful dark spirit during harmonic convergence, which is only a few days away."
"If he succeeds, the world as we know it is over."
"Sir, we desperately need your help."
"I'm sorry, Korra, but my answer is still no."
There are lives on the line!
And my daughter is one of them.
"Raiko, you must reconsider."
"I'm aware that lives are on the line, and that's precisely why my troops are staying here."
"If the world is going to be thrown into chaos, like you claim, I need to protect my citizens."
I'm sorry.
Sir...
Nuktuk needs your help.
I know you love helping people.
"Son, I appreciate you saving my life, and I'm a big fan of your work, but my decision is final."
I never should have saved that guy.
"If you guys need help, I'm here for you."
"Yeah, me too."
Thank you.
It's so good to see you guys again.
"Wait, where's Mako?"
So how was the big premiere?
I saved the president!
In real life!
"Wait, what?"
You were right about Varrick.
He tried to kidnap Raiko!
I knew it.
"But it didn't work, because of you."
And because of me.
"When it's done,"
- do you think you're gonna fly home or...
- I-I-I don't know.
"Look, you don't have a fear of flying."
"You're afraid of something else, but the thought of flying triggers that fear."
"Maybe you're not afraid of flying, you're afraid of going away."
- What do you mean?
I-I don't get that.
- Just...
Ace that presentation.
Ok.
Seniors...
How can we get them to use the Internet?
"In the past, we have simplified it, restricted access, dumbed it down."
But I think that's the wrong approach.
I don't think seniors are any more confused by the Internet than I am.
I think they're afraid of it.
"Watch this video, please."
My name's Al Jordan.
I'm 82 years old.
- Do you ever use the Internet?
- I wouldn't want to mess it up.
We created a mock form that's really a search engine.
"Each time you enter a term, it takes you to a related website, then you have to find your way back."
- The form has changed.
- Yes.
"Now I'm looking outside those,"
- put in Saskatchewan.
- Yes.
So I'm gonna leave you for about three hours
"Wait, wait."
What if I break it?
Looking for some cell service.
"Hey, why don't I sit in your lap and you can drive me around?"
"Two birds, one stone?"
I wasn't that attracted to you anyway.
I'm gonna go try to find some reception.
Seeing Randy miserable is the only thing that'll cheer me up right now.
Maybe he's crying.
"One vodka for the gentleman with the neck tattoo, and two vodkas for the lady who's into that sort of thing."
Thank you.
Your catfish tower's on its way.
It takes two to carry the cocktail sauce lagoon.
Everything on double-zero.
Which has to be the Yelp rating of this boat.
Excuse me?
Could I get a white wine spritzer?
"Oh, come on, Vera."
We share a locker.
"Oh, double-zero."
Winner.
"Yes, I'm a winner again!"
"Suck it, river people."
What is going on over here?
Employees are not allowed to gamble.
"Or, as of last week, sexually harass each other."
"Thanks a lot, Craig."
Ugh.
Poindexter in the radio room wouldn't let me use the satellite phone.
"Also, I broke your satellite phone."
That is it.
You're fired.
"That's the worst news I've heard since you said ""you're hired."""
There's a tug coming to swap out the toilet tanks.
"At the time, I had no idea that he was going to build a crazy boat."
It's a weird-looking thing.
"Yeah, we saw that coming in yesterday."
"""What the hell is that thing?"""
"Yeah, it looks like sort of a, you know, Jules Verne thing."
Lou built this boat out of steel.
It's a music barge that motors up to small towns all over the world and opens up into a concert stage.
"It was commissioned by a man named Robert Boudreau, who is both the ship's captain and the orchestra conductor."
I didn't tell him that I was Lou's son.
- Hi.
"- Hi, Robert."
Hi.
- Nice to see you.
"- Hi, there."
What are you up to?
Put that damn thing down.
"- Yeah, how are you?"
"- Hi, nice to meet you."
- Quite a boat you have here.
- Thanks.
This is that symphony boat to that cruiser in front of us.
I think it might be a good idea if you just moved out until we went in to dock and then came back in.
"So, Robert, this boat is very futuristic."
"Oh, yeah, people say this thing's from Mars, you know?"
"You know, I love this boat."
"This is my boat, I created it, with Lou."
- So you loved him?
"- Oh, yeah."
"That's a Louie Kahn doorway for sure, isn't it?"
You don't get 'em any better than that.
Isn't that amazing?
"Well, take a look."
Her life and half of humanity.
If the Nazis find that door they will come to the present.
and obtain weapons and modern technology.
Do you know what that would mean?
They will win the second World War.
and they will eliminate anyone who doesn't conform to their ideas.
You don't have to tell me.
"I have experience in that area, I assure you."
What are you going to do with me?
We'll figure it out.
Now leave.
May I take the photo?
(ANGUSTIAS) May I come in?
-Like you need permission.
Do we know what will happen to him if he returns to his time?
No.
I'm trying to locate Espínola.
I call him and it cuts off or goes straight to the machine.
-Espínola?
Things must be bad...
Sorry about the wait.
We weren't expecting you so soon.
Typical.
The guy who brought us must have a date later.
He's crazy.
"We call him ""Offroader""."
"So, how's 2015?"
Good...
"I hope it's better than now, when there's nothing to eat."
"We're headed that way, don't doubt it."
And then they say that humanity is evolving.
Evolving my ass. (SCRAPING)
"When you worked f or Martinelli, did he take stuff home briefcase, papers or did he leave them locked up in his office?"
"I don't know, ex cept he kept my contract in his office."
Why?
"Last night, Louis the bar man had a letter f or me that Johnny gave him."
- What did it say?
- l don't know.
Martinelli got it.
- How do you know?
"- When your phone call woke me up Louis was in my room, lying on the other bed with a broken neck."
"- Oh, Rip."
- Yeah.
I'm a guy that likes to get his mail.
Martinelli would have destroyed it by now.
"No, he'd want to read it first."
Johnny would have written it in code.
"My guess is, he's still trying to figure it out. i'm going after it."
- Not back there?
- Yeah.
I just had my f riend Baretto on the phone.
He gave me the name of a safe expert.
He was so good the law took a little slice out of his life.
- He's retired.
Lives in this town.
- What good is--?
I don't think Johnny killed your husband.
- Why?
- l knew him like my own birthmark.
"Rip, there's something I didn't tell the coroner because Johnny wouldn't let me."
I was right there when it happened.
"Johnny was af raid they'd blame me, tie us both up."
Ex-nightclub singer and young college professor murder her husband.
- But that wasn't the way it was.
This is 2007.
And I have a friend who worked for the Irish chart-compiling company.
"He said, 200 copies, if you buy them in the correct stores that are chart-tracking that month."
It will get you to 27?
"That's all you need for 27, yeah."
So I recorded a song in two hours.
"It was called Orange, about ladies who wear too much tan and we burned it."
Rude.
It's rude.
"Oh, really?"
But you know...
I love a tan.
"You know the one that stops there on the jawline, where it's just complete whiteness."
"What, you mean me about twice a month?"
"Hey, really?"
"Yeah, there's no shame in it."
Sometimes you put it on when you're a bit drunk.
You end up with one big orange hand.
Yeah.
My first husband had...
An orange cock.
LAUGHTER
My first husband had no true idea of my actual ethnicity until well after we got married.
He just thought I was kind of a Mediterranean dusky beauty until about six months.
"He just pulled back the duvet one day and went, ""Fuck!"""
"And I was kind of like a pale blue colour, like a pale, white, porridgy colour."
"""Hello, I'm from Cumbria."" That's exactly it."
"Sorry, I get..."
"So we recorded this song, we burnt 200 copies on my laptop and made a cover."
You just need a barcode.
It isn't very hard to get.
And registered me as a label.
Ok I already told Becca but since you asked... girls...
Jill you can just tell me later.
Stacy I'm so sorry...
I don't mean to spoil your special little moment.
But I have a huge announcement to make...
I'm getting married!
Isn't it gorgeous?
Do you love it?
It was the most amazing night you guys.
I don't want to just be your girlfriend anymore!
It's not that I don't...
love you...
"It's not fair, I can' take this limbo!"
I know...
You either marry me or you leave me!
It was the most romantic night of my life.
"What can I say, he's the best."
You've got to be kidding me!
"Drew, I'm sorry but he was hitting on me less than two months ago."
"Ok... he wasn't hitting on you, Hallie."
He was flirting with you.
"Guys are allowed to flirt, it's a human condition."
It's natural.
You think everyone is flirting with you.
I don't know I just think it's weird if a guy is ultra flirtatious... and in a committed relationship.
And not to mention that he's in the business.
Men in the entertainment industry are instinctively douche bags.
No?
No I like Drew.
I don't think he's a douche bag.
Well...
Who came up with the term douche bag anyway?
It's a marked trail.
It's a trail.
So we're going through The middle of bum.
The only trail there.
Those are a lot Of mights and maybes.
We might find a trail.
It may be marked.
There's supposed To be a path.
"When they find The access point to the claim,"
They'll have to Bring in a dredge.
"Built specifically To launch from riverbanks,"
One that brad's commandeered For the mission.
You know what?
We really should've came here One day of scouting.
Without the boat And everything.
It doesn't matter.
It's here now.
"We need it here, Regardless of what we do."
"I know a few miners around Town, And my buddy let me use."
His dredge.
"- Good, take it forward."
- There we go.
I bring a lot of Different things.
"You know, always trying to Inspire the other family Member."
That's what We try and do.
"You know, maybe we do it In an unorthodox way,"
But we're trying To inspire each other.
"To become better citizens, Better people overall."
And probably better Gold dredgers.
"Now, hopefully, The river claim."
Is only an atv ride away... find us the easiest Road down there.
Or the kellys' plan Could be washed away.
"Oh, my God, this is gonna be so crazy."
Wow.
Has anyone made noise in here yet?
- We get pretty loud.
- Do you?
"Yeah, yeah."
"No, don't be worried about the volume."
- Okay.
- Yeah.
How much has it changed?
- Zero.
"- ""Zero."" Really, zero?"
It was how my parent...
"You know, they wanted to keep it just like they walked into it."
- Yeah.
- And that's what they did.
"They just said ""We're never gonna change..."
"Change it from that experience,"" you know."
Rad!
"Well, I'm going to Pat O'Brien's."
I'll see you guys.
This place is so thick with vibe.
You know?
"You just feel like, the sweat of generations you know, pouring off the walls."
"To see all our gear in there is a trip, you know?"
It's so out of...
It just seemed out of place.
"Like, ""Fuck, I hope we don't rattle the fucking building down or whatever, with the volume,"" you know?"
Originally it was built as a Spanish tavern.
And then over the years it's been a lot of things.
It was a photo studio where most of uptown aristocracy would come downtown and get their photos taken.
So you'd go into people's houses on St. Charles Avenue and you'd see their portraits in their Mardi Gras gowns and they're in the courtyard of Preservation Hall.
"It's glorious, isn't it?"
I'm surprised that it arrived so soon.
Yea.
Terrific.
I'll just have a go at the gears.
Then you can take her out for a spin.
"Double-time it, Magnum."
Swimsuit on.
"Mr. Higgins, if you could have it ready by the time Magnum finishes his swim, that would be perfect."
No problem.
"Actually, Magnum, I quite envy you the bike race... because the course cuts through the Austin Memorial Gardens, which are normally off-limits to visitors."
I've been there.
You have?
Yeah.
"Well, Roger wrote about the Austin Gardens a lot, so it was the first place I went when I landed."
He worked there when he first came to the Islands.
Why didn't you tell me this?
I'm your investigator.
I don't know.
"Well, he wasn't there."
They didn't know where he'd gone.
But they said he was wonderful with tropical flowers.
We have got to talk.
"When you've had your swim, then we'll try out the new bike."
"Barbara, I have the feeling you're stringing me along, and it's going to stop now."
What?
You don't think Roger proposed to me?
Oh.!
Or...
Or you think I'm the kind of girl that never gets proposed to.
"- No, that's not what I mean."
"- Well, I'll have you know... that in high school I was voted queen of the Friday night dance... twice."
Of all the fucking people.
She gave up everybody.
"Jimmy, me."
Even her brother.
It took the jury six hours to bring us in guilty.
"Judge gave Jimmy and me ten years, like he was giving away candy."
Ten years in a federal penitentiary.
You will now be turned over to the U.S. Attorney Generals office.
"Toast, guys."
"Good trip, good life."
Get out soon.
"Good trip, sweetheart."
We'll watch the home front.
"Say hello to those blow-job hacks, huh?"
Motherfuck them every chance you get.
"I'll call you, uh, when I get a chance."
Now take me to jail.
"In prison, dinner was always a big thing."
"We had a pasta course, then we had a meat or a fish."
Paulie did the prep work.
He was doing a year for contempt and he had a wonderful system for doing the garlic.
He used a razor and sliced it so thin it would liquefy in the pan with just a little oil.
It was a very good system.
Vinnie was in charge of the tomato sauce.
Get that smell?
Three kinds of meat in the meatballs:
"veal, beef, and pork."
You got to have pork.
That's the flavor.
"I felt he used too many onions, but it was still a very good sauce."
Don't put too many onions in the sauce.
"I didn't put too much onions in, Paul."
Just switching things up a little bit.
"You know, it's like having breakfast for dinner."
Mmm!
"Now, about this van, I mean, it really is a super-cool idea for the future."
"- I mean, it's like the perfect plan."
- I haven't told you the plan.
"Great, cause I do not understand it."
"I think I've found an untapped market that, if properly assessed, may be poised... to explode."
"Okay, I get it."
"It's like you have a huge pile of dynamite, and you just lit the fuse."
I can see it right now--
I still haven't told you the idea.
"Great, 'cause I still don't understand it."
I'm gonna show you.
"And, mom, trust me, this isn't some, like, get-rich-quick plan."
"Oh, like your dad's idea for the reverse microwave, where it makes the food cold?"
Reverse microwave's a good idea in a world where a freezer doesn't exist.
Mom...
"[ Sighs ] you believe in me, right?"
Of course.
[ Both laugh ]
You think you maybe want to put on some pants today?
Pants are for closers.
I'm a bum.
What are you doing?
I always do that.
It turns me on.
Ooh!
Ooh!
What is it?
I was thinking about how you lost your mayor's job.
Stupid city council impeached me.
It was my fault.
- What you sorry about?
I am not.
Then let's just say that we were foolish and next time we'll drink to one another's health.
I suppose it was all in fun when you kissed me.
Yes.
It wasn't all in fun then.
I know that.
"Well, goodbye and good luck."
"Come on, John."
Don't be stuffy.
"After all, the lady wasn't injured, nor was anyone else."
I imagine she might be a tempting morsel in an off moment.
"- What do you mean, ""off moment""?"
"- Yours, according to your theory."
"I imagine what I just witnessed was the momentary triumph of the evil in your soul over the good, huh?"
Correct?
"Yes, yes."
"I don't think it was a triumph, but it was an attack."
"But one which would have been repulsed even without your help, John."
Wouldn't you run less risk if you confined your experiments to the lab?
That's where you'll find me from tonight on until I get what I'm looking for.
"I'm worried, John."
- He ought to have let us know.
- He'll be along.
"Maybe it's all for the best, Dr. Jekyll."
That wasn't my son in there.
It was as if the evil one had crept into his heart.
My poor Sam.
"- Burke, take Mrs. Higgins home."
"- Yes, sir."
- I'll walk.
I am an Allied agent and I need your help.
- Is Major George Stirling here?
- That's me.
It's an honor to meet you.
"I have colleagues on the outside, right now, helping me plan a breakout."
The men who escape with me will help train Resistance fighters from here all the way to the Northern Coast.
I'm not risking these men's lives for anything less than a solid plan.
"If we're gonna turn things around, we need to do something now."
You can't just wait here to die.
- We're digging a tunnel.
- Danny.
You can trust me.
"I broke in for you, didn't I?"
- We're clearing a foot a day.
- When do you expect to finish?
"Three months, give or take."
Then we're all getting out.
- We don't have that much time.
- Time 'til what?
I can't say.
"But we have weeks, not months."
It's an important operation.
It could make the difference.
We need your most experienced men.
"Your strongest, to help train civilian recruits."
So what's your plan?
Next time on work detail
I'll give a signal.
My team will provide covering fire while we break for the woods.
Ahh!
They said you told them nothing at the gate.
"You are a mystery, and I am a curious person."
Uh-huh.
"That money was for the poor, John."
"Look, I'm not saying I took the money, but maybe the kid that did..."
And I'm just spitballing here...
Maybe that kid needed a new mitt.
"And maybe his mom didn't have the cash to get him one, so, you know, if you think about it, that kid was kind of poor too."
"That box is for the people who don't have food to eat, John."
"Listen, I heard about your dad, and we've been praying for him."
I appreciate it.
Thanks.
"You know, those candles don't work unless you put $3 in them."
"Oh, yeah?"
Oh.
You have change for a 5?
I do not.
But I'll take the fiver.
We'll consider it down payment on the 40.
"Of course I took the money, Brian, but that mitt was sweet."
"Rawlings, heart of the hide."
- The gold glove model?
- Top of the line.
I spent the entire off-season working that thing in.
"Rubbing oil on it, tied a baseball up in it."
"My first game back, I made this sweet diving catch on a liner right up the middle, oh!"
"But then you left it on the bus or lost it somewhere 'cause you were subconsciously trying to punish yourself, right?"
"Hell, no."
I used that mitt all the way up to college.
Still have it.
"23 years, it's the longest relationship I've ever been in."
- Hmm.
- I love that mitt.
We should go out and throw sometime.
[tense music]
His readings could triangulate when wind and sound
- make contact with an object.
- How does that help us?
"If we can pinpoint the precise point of impact every time wind hits that object,"
I think I can build a 3D outline of what the crime scene looked like.
You can get me a face?
"If his data's reliable,"
I'll be able to show you who killed Roger before you're done with dinner.
You just signed your new client.
Give him what he wants.
[computer beeping]
[footsteps approaching]
"Dad, what're you doing?"
I was thinking we might go camping.
Like in the backyard?
"Uh, no, a little further than that."
I thought we could head up north.
Thought we could sleep under the stars just for a while.
Doesn't that sound fun?
We'd go outside the wall?
"Well, yes."
Would we have to go through the Red Zone to get there?
Since when have you been worried about the Red Zone?
"My Spiga Scout leader says bad people live there, and they hate us."
That's why we have the wall.
"Hazel, your scout leader is a dummy."
"Now, come on."
We'd be together the whole time.
We'd share an adventure.
You and me.
"- I don't wanna go there, Dad."
"- We're all gonna die, Elliot."
The only question is when and how?
What?
You pulled Bianco's LUDs?
Swell.
- Fin?
- Yeah.
Amy Solwey's been calling Bianco.
Everyone who needs a kidney knows about Russ Bianco.
What's the big deal?
"Well, you called him a couple dozen times over the last two months."
You're at the top of the NTCC list.
What do you need a guy like that for?
Insurance.
In case my next transplant doesn't work.
Really?
What is Bianco paying you to find buyers for his hot kidneys?
I do it for nothing.
"Going to jail for assisted suicide didn't teach you a damn thing, did it?"
Sure it did.
Now I help people live instead of die.
"Amy, you're still breaking the law."
Arrest me.
"We don't want you, we want the surgeon who's performing the transplants."
He's saving lives.
"Give us his name, or you're going back to jail."
No jail's worse than living in the prison of a sick body.
You'll be living in both when they take your name off that transplant list.
That would never happen.
"When the NTCC finds out that you've been trafficking in black market kidneys, they're gonna cross you right off the list."
You'd let me die?
Give us the surgeon's name.
"You have motive, the insurance money."
Or not giving Gus his cut.
Gus and I have been friends since college.
He did me a favor by showing here.
I would never betray him.
"Okay, um, let's say I believe you."
Who else has the password?
"Besides myself, my assistant and Gus."
Why would Gus have it?
"He's been working around the clock, putting finishing touches on his pieces for the exhibit."
He was taking photos as late as last week.
Are you looking for suspects?
I'll give you suspects.
"What about the guy who wrecked my work three years ago, huh?"
Or what about those jerks that stole my painting from the museum last month?
Why aren't you guys out there looking for them?
"Because you're lying about something, Mr. Walker."
I don't e.
"I don't lie in my life and not in my work, got it?"
Someone besides me wanted my art off these walls.
Go find them!
(Colin) Are you okay?
"Yeah, I'm fine."
He didn't hurt us.
It's just that I don't think it was random.
What do you mean?
"Well, the mugger went for my bag first."
He only seemed to take Sondra's purse as an afterthought.
You know that thing Angela got from the cleaners?
I think the mugger thought I had it in my bag.
"You know, luckily, I didn't."
There's part of it I just--I can't--
- Go.
- Ain't you joining?
I joined last month.
"- Hey, I wanna ask a question."
- Yeah?
"If we joined up, don't we get a uniform or something?"
"Man, the Black Legion's got the doggonest uniform you ever laid eyes on."
"One that will throw fear into the hearts of all them rotten, ungrateful foreigners."
One bar ain't enough.
It goes to prove it.
The man was hungry and there should be two bars a day because--
He eats as much as we all do.
"Say, are you gonna let him bust in on me like that?"
"What do you mean, talking to the judge like that, you mug?"
"I'm sorry, Your Honor, but let me explain something."
There should be two bars a day.
One in the morning and one in the afternoon.
Do I have to put up with that little slug interrupting all the time?
You two guys better get along together.
I'll kick you both out of court.
"Okay, the state rests."
What do you do?
"Oh, we rest too."
Then the jury will retire and consider a verdict.
"- Hey, Butch."
"- Yes, sir?"
Come here.
- When did you see Jim last?
"- Oh, about an hour ago in the dormitory."
Yeah.
I'll look him up and have a talk with him.
Didn't I tell you everything would be all right?
Right.
You pointed the finger at Cole.
You led everyone up the garden path.
"Meanwhile, we've got two coppers murdered."
I'm not saying another word without a solicitor.
"Fine, we'll continue this conversation at AC-12 under caution, a date to be appointed by us."
Thank you.
Sir.
You have to shut this down.
I will not let anyone put you on the spot about Cole.
We both know why.
Shut this down now.
You know the secrets I can spill.
"Why don't you come into AC-12 with your solicitor, you tell us you heard the Caddy rumour about Cole off some old lag, dead or lost his marbles, and you leave me to do the rest?"
And?
There's always an and.
And... you turn over all the stuff you've got on me.
End of.
End of?
"The incriminating item I've got on you, that's my only insurance."
You need me to shut this down.
I'm small fry.
You're the big fish.
So what'll happen when they find out about all that evidence you've been sitting on?
Hm?
The contacts in that phone.
The call history.
"All in my past, mind."
"Now, that isn't something anyone could shut down."
"Now, you're what?"
Six months off retiring?
Four and a half.
"And then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud."
He'll draw every light from every goon tower.
It's our only chance to cut through.
"What do you say, barracks chief?"
"He's right, Hoffy."
It's either Price or Dunbar.
"He killed Johnson and Manfredi, didn't he?"
It's all yours.
"What's the matter, Price?"
"You said you were gonna save Dunbar, didn't you?"
So now you're getting your chance.
"So long, Cookie."
"You can have the department store, what's left of it."
"So long, Sefton."
"You're not disposing of those Russian broads, are you?"
Tell you what to do.
Get yourself 100 cigarettes for the Kraut guards.
Then get yourself another face.
- You could use a new one too.
-Ha-ha-ha.
Let's synchronize the watches.
It's 11:42 sharp.
Check.
Just one more word.
If I ever run into any of you bums on a street corner just let's pretend we never met before.
Shut off the moaning or you'll have the machine guns on us.
"Shut it off, lieutenant."
My legs are frozen.
You'd better get that blue blood circulating because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly one minute and 20 seconds.
- Sefton.
"-What'd you expect, a St. Bernard dog?"
- Not you.
I'll be right back.
John.
It's disarmed.
Thank God you're all right.
Where's the president?
"He didn't make it, sir."
I need to address the nation.
"General, get on with the Joint Chiefs."
We need to move our troops into the Middle East to stabilize the region.
You wanna move troops in?
When they find out that we almost launched a nuclear attack..
there's gonna be chaos.
We have to contain it.
Can I ask you a question?
Of course.
Yeah.
When did you and Walker cook this whole thing up?
Excuse me?
How'd it go?
You gave Walker the launch codes and he made you president?
You can prove this?
"Well, Walker had to get the launch codes from somewhere.."
and you were the only person with those codes.
And I found this pager in Walker's pocket.
I only know one other person that uses one of these.
That doesn't prove anything.
Two old guys use old technology.
So what?
"Why don't you call the return number on that, Carol?"
Would have been better if the evidence had been destroyed..
in the air strike that you ordered.
"You're a goddamn traitor, sir."
"What are you looking at, say thank you, and give the payment."
"Son, tell me one thing."
Is there any good corner in this hotel?
Why?
Because you payment is very big.
"If i will give it here, everyone will see it."
"Yeah, there is a corner, let me show you, come... why are you beating me Bhai?"
"Hit him... if you don't want to give the payment, forget it, but why you are beating me i am cheep, and i will wear this?"
Tell me where is the diamond?
Here's your diamond.
The diamond which was snitch from me and took my honor.
Honor can be destroy by snitching this too.
Diamond which shines...
Bhai see this how shiny is this.
The diamond which was stolen by Yadave.
Now who is Yadav Bhai?
"Yadav, that's Yadav."
I have come to shoot him Bhai.
Now what is he?
"He stole you diamond, Diamond was stolen by Yadev."
Then you did you send his photo.
"Not his, i have send you his photo in the envelope."
Then why this photo came out.
"You are lying... you are lying, you have send this photo."
"And that diamond photo too, and after this you are beating me too."
You didn't got his photo?
"No, otherwise i would never spear him."
I even beaten him too.
"When, where?"
He was running from the street.
So where he is right now?
"But the one who he was following, is in the same hotel."
"You know, instead of adding someone... maybe you should think about weeding out a few."
Like you and you and... you.
- I'm your son.
- I can't play favorites.
"You know, if you're looking for a new friend, how about Lance Crawford?"
He's such a nice boy.
"Mom, Lance Crawford and I hate each other."
You're just obsessed with getting his mother's peach cobbler recipe.
"Well, what kind of a woman keeps a recipe a secret?"
"If that recipe were the polio vaccine, we'd all be in wheelchairs!"
I don't like Lance Crawford.
He's always staring at me in this really creepy way.
"And this one time, I saw him fiddling around in my locker."
"When I opened it, there was a rose inside, and my gym socks were missing."
"Donna, a little advice."
You're not gonna want those socks back.
I can't think of anyone new I wanna hang out with.
All the girls I know are either too snobby or too slutty.
"Yeah, I'm not good with the snobs, but slutty's my bread and butter."
"You know, what we need are people with stuff to offer, like Mark Herman."
He's got that dirt bike.
I always liked him.
- Sold it last week.
- That punk.
He's out.
"Hey, Carrie Gerber has a trampoline."
"Carrie Gerber also has a big, hairy mole."
I don't wanna be bouncing around and get tangled up in that.
Eric.
Eric.
"Honey, there's someone here to see you."
"Mom, if it's another one of Dad's Marine Corps recruiters, I'm gonna run away."
"Shut down, always trying to be the tough guy."
Do you know how many times I cried in a helmet?
I'm fine.
Your engagement broke off last week.
Now you're sleeping on the couch of a guy whose middle name you probably don't even know.
Patrick.
"Fine, we're best friends."
But you can't tell me you're not hurting right now.
"Look, honestly, I don't know how I'm feeling, okay?"
"There's a lot of things going on in my mind right now, and I just need to sort some things out."
"We will, I promise you."
Two nights on my couch and I will get inside of you.
Feel like we got off to a weird start.
It's so nice out.
I know.
"Walking outside, in the fresh air..."
We should get a treadmill.
"You know, it's so weird that lily and Neal actually broke up."
"I know, it's a classic story."
"Couple falls in love, decides to get engaged, disaster and heartbreak follow."
What kind of fairy tales were you read as a kid?
"My favorite one was called ""eviction notice,"""
where the princess had to move to a new castle.
- Ah.
- Mm-hmm.
Did your dad ever hug you?
"Aw, come here."
"Mm, not like that."
"Well, I can think of some other things your dad never did to you."
"- Okay, first of all, ew."
- Mm.
"Second of all, ew."
"That, and the fact that she speaks English."
- You didn't have to do this.
"- But it's teatime, and I wanted to..."
"Oh, no."
"Beatrice, I told you to doily-line the plates."
You don't have to doily-line the plates.
- Hello.
- We're in the dining room.
"- Rory, you're already here."
- You're out of breath.
- I ran over from the office.
- You didn't have to run.
Your grandmother said you had something to discuss with us.
That certainly justifies a run.
"All right, everybody, sit."
"Pour the tea, Beatrice."
"Actually, Beatrice, could you hold off on... pouring the tea for just a minute?"
Thank you very much.
"Grandma, Grandpa, I would like to propose an idea to you."
You can go for it or not.
It's entirely up to you.
But I would like for you to promise me that you will not get upset.
We won't get upset.
- And you will try to keep an open mind.
- All right.
And you will let me finish my presentation completely before you respond.
She's been hanging around you far too much.
"Rory, we accept your terms."
Please proceed.
Thank you.
"First, let me start by saying that Mom doesn't know I'm here."
"She'd probably be mad if she knew that I was, but I feel this is important."
Do you have no pride?
"You're like a cheap whore who'll do whatever her man wants, you know that?"
What about the honeymoon?
Did the director say anything?
"Come on, cooperate with me."
That man was mine since I was sixteen.
That can't be.
Have you been here before?
Have you been here?
I just passed by it on the way to a company workshop.
I'm really a bastard.
"Ever since that day, I think about having you half the day, every day."
I think that's all that's occupying my thoughts.
"Sometimes I wonder, how can I be less of a bastard and still hold you in my arms?"
"I was always like, ""What should I do?"" ""Can I make a move first?"""
But I was afraid that I would be embarassed.
Aren't you taking too much meds?
Why are you taking meds so often?
It hurts.
Is something bothering you that I don't know about?
There's no such thing.
-Why does it hurt so often then?
- I don't know.
Maybe something's growing inside.
Don't even say that!
It just comes too often.
-Could it be really brain tumor?
-Stop saying that and go to a hospital.
It will stop.
"Sis, did you go out?"
I thought you said you weren't going out.
"I said, ""Your fat ass gonna die, man."""
"Now I used to work in the back, washing the plates, the knives and the forks with my white friend, James."
"Now, there was an old Black dude named Fred, he used to wash the pots and the pans."
Now Chris Rock said it the best about old Black men.
"He said it the best, he said..."
"""Old Black men"
"""are the most racist people in the world."
"""Who the fuck are you?"
"Who the fuck are you?"""
"""Who the fuck are you to talk about..."""
"""They don't even fucking fight you."
"They just shoot you, ahh."""
"So they decided to send rolls to the back, right?"
I thought it'd be funny to pick up a roll and throw it at Fred.
'Cause I like messing with people.
"I picked up the roll, I threw it at Fred."
"It hit him, hit his water."
The water splashed him in his face.
But he thought that James threw the roll.
"Yeah, ""Oh, shit,"" right?"
"So in the back of Golden Corral,"
"I kid you not, he had a civil rights flashback right there."
"And it's like he turned back into a slave as soon as it happened, man."
"He said, ""Woosh!"""
"""Hey, cracker!"
"""You's throw another roll, and I's gonna fuck you up."""
"Now, New York, I had a decision to make."
"But I ain't no punk, I'm a survivor, so I was like,"
"""Yeah, throw another roll, cracker."""
And I was like... ¶ Wade in the water.
¶ Wade in the water.
¶ Whoa wade in the water.
- That's always a good sign.
It had to be them.
I know where they are.
"I'll get back to you, Frank."
"Here, show me on the map."
I figured I must have been around here.
But I couldn't understand what Edgar was doing there.
"Then I realised, if he was fighting the weather, and wound up somewhere east of the mountains, about here, he'd have a straight shot over the mountains into Pasco."
He must have took the chance that he had enough gas.
You always take chances like that?
"If not, the mail wouldn't get through."
- This is Capital Peak.
- They must be on this ridge.
"About halfway down the big saddle, there's a clearing in the timber."
What I saw must have been wings.
Get the mail out by train.
He'll take out number eight.
Go as quickly as you can.
You'll have company.
I'm sending everyone up as soon as they refuel.
- He comes through after all.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Maybe our luck is changing.
Jim.
- We could get married.
- What makes you say that?
I cancelled the letters out in our names.
You ever do that?
"You write some boy's last name and then yours underneath, and you cross out the letters that are the same."
"If there are a lot of crosses, you can get married."
A lot of ours do.
But you're wasting your time.
I didn't kill Bob Keaton.
"But you did process the scene, which means you do know who did kill him."
I'm not at liberty to say.
"Mr. Park, what can you tell me ?"
That this case doesn't exist.
And neither do I.
"Well, then, how do you explain me ?"
Lieutenant Caine... nothing good comes from waking ghosts.
I think you know what I mean.
"But if you can wake them, then maybe... they're not ghosts."
"Hey, Alexx."
"Hey, Ryan."
Did you determine the cause of death on my quarterback ?
Blunt-force trauma was the cause.
And I may have also found the person who caused it.
I found this in his pants pocket.
"I know about the curve, you're a dead man."
"""Curve..."""
What kind of curve ?
"Whatever it was, guess it was something worth killing for."
That's weird.
Note has perforated edges.
It looks like dot-matrix printer paper.
Who uses that kind of paper these days ?
Exactly.
I didn't write any note to Patrick.
You pulled me out of the reunion for this ?
"Yeah, we did."
You wrote the note 15 years ago.
You can't prove that.
The paper was the first indication.
And you?
I trusted you.
I had to do what was best for my family.
- Don't you ever call me again.
- I'm sorry you feel that way.
Not sorry enough.
What are you reading?
Seeing with Serenity:
How to Cope With What Life Deals You.
I took a trip to the self-help section at the bookstore.
"So far, it's just pages and pages of vague platitudes."
"Mom, you've been avoiding my calls."
I didn't know what I wanted to say.
I wish I could turn back the clock and make a different decision.
- But I can't.
- I know.
You seem angrier at me than Kevin or Tommy.
Am I wrong?
Probably not.
You hold me to a different standard than anyone else.
That's not fair.
Yes.
"You're right, it's not fair."
I just always felt this connection with you.
You raise a boy and you don't expect them to tell you anything.
You're lucky if they acknowledge you on their way out the door.
But you always confided in me.
I felt like you trusted me to handle whatever came along.
I never had that relationship with my mother.
I always thought I had it with you.
"Mom, we do have that relationship."
The last thing in the world I wanted to do was hurt you.
This is a high treason to the Federation!
Go to hell!
That gave me luck.
"It was almost a palette, until I met my new friends."
"It's good to see you alive, brother."
Who put us in charge of the world?
How did our lie become our truth?
Nobody cares to remember.
The cold heart of nature now forms honest men on the ice.
"And under the area of death, life comes."
"After 300 years of slavery,"
The humanoids are walking towards their freedom.
"We did it, Mara!"
Thank you my love.
I'll see you upstairs.
In a world invaded by cowards.
The only thing left for a man is to fight.
"Fight, until hell freezes."
Then fight them on the ice.

You're going to die in a year...
"You'd only have a year left, is there something you'd like to do or see?"
A year is too long.
Let's do just 3 months left.
Okay then.
Let's say you only have 3 months left.
"I'll live recklessly, and take care of people who backstabbed me."
I'll kill the bastards I don't like.

Look at the size of the diamond he's holding.
This same old scene takes place in every story.
One dude makes a last minute entry and the engagement goes for a six...
You and your intense look.
Don't worry.
This won't happen to you.
Do you know why?
"Because women don't fall for the man, but the mansion."
Right?
You ditcher...
I left for a week and you left me.
Only if you had been a little more crazy... you would never have left me.
You remember what I had told you?
"You can give her a ring, but I'll be the one taking her home."
Remember that.
Stay for dinner.
I was only playing with destiny.
"Anyway, he will die as destined."
Go find him.
What's the angle?
Why have you come here?
Vampires.
I do envy true believers.
I do.
I wish I could get out of my brain and... experience a real...
Spiritual ecstasy or...
That's what Tequila's for.
You really feel that way?
I do.
I would love to feel God's presence.
"Ah, so you admit the possibility that God exists."
"Well, it can't be proved, but it can't be disproved, either."
"So, therefore, I..."
I think God may exist.
"This is the last of the cinnamon, by the way."
I'll pick you up some tomorrow.
Thank you.
"See, this... this may be proof that God exists."
Must have cinnamon with with Will's special hot chocolate.
"Not work, I hope."
"No, it's Esme."
I gave her a jacket today to impress a boy.
"""Jacket worked."
We hung out after school.
"Miles is awesome."""
I'd forgotten how macabre this office is.
"Well, under the circumstances, the decor seems appropriate."
"Well, you know, I'm just one of those guys."
I'm not...
I am simply not afraid of death.
I don't know why.
"I see it as either a beautiful release or a start of a great, unknown adventure."
That's easy for you to say.
"Trust me, give all yours to him, you'll be safe."
"I don't know about others but I feel like seeing the thief once, only then I can be happy."
"You'll definitely see him sir, you've seen me, haven't you sir?"
You've seen him!
"From now onwards, I'll give the kick of life for all of you."
"Previously on ""Being Erica""..."
Is it true that you're taking Friedken's book from Julianne?
"Julianne's ship is taking on water, fast."
She gave me my shot.
"She's a friend, and I'm not just gonna abandon her."
"I'm disappointed in you, Erica."
The feeling's mutual.
That girl is my daughter.
I don't feel like you want me to have a life.
"We had a fight this day, and it was one of many, but this day I said some things that I later regretted."
You're hurting me!
And this was the last time that I saw my daughter.
"I mean, I didn't know if she was dead or alive... and I still don't."
So... you sing really well.
"You're like a barista by day, a rock star by night."
"I do have feelings for you, Kai."
"I wish that I didn't, but I do."
"Relationships-- they're like pillars in our lives, providing support, defining the space in which we live."
Good morning.
"Hey, you."
Is everything ok?
Yeah.
Everything's fine.
Why?
"You know, you're the worst liar on the planet."
Uhh...
You're lost on this e?
Puzzled.
"They barely knew finn, yet they let him move in,loaned him money."
They trusted a man who took advantage of them.
"If you're in a relationship and the other person is keeping secrets, how would you know?"
You'd know.
I didn'T.
Who lied to you?
You did.
"Not exactly lied,but you just didn't tell me the whole truth either."
You're comparing me to finn?
I'm just saying that you can be involved with someone without fully knowing them.
How could you not tell me about your family?
Finish your e-mail.
You wanted my advice.
Just don't be too hard on the fiancees.
Finn duped them.
And I shouldn't have brought up the past.
I know you had your reasons for not wanting to tk about it.
We're talking about it now.
Now is not paris.
Your priorities were clear on paris.
I had a job to do in europe.
"If I had told you about my first wife, would it have made a difference?"
"We'll never know,will we?"
yeah.Gibbs.
You went home early.
Stayed until 2130.
That's early for you.
"You called to talk about my work hours, Dr. Mallard?"
"No,agent gibbs."
I had a hunch which led me to trim lance corporal finn's nose hairs.
I got a text from my daughter last night.
Chivonne?
I guess her auntie finally told her I was out.
She wants to see me.
What'd you tell her?
I told her yes.
"Okay, Doc, you can say it."
"Look, I know that she's the reason why you're doing this, that you want to be someone that she can look up to."
But seeing her right now could be really dangerous for both of you.
"I know, but she asked to see me."
"After all this time, she came to me."
"If I turn her down, I might not get a second chance."
Just be careful.
Always.
"Hello, olá, and Eoh, wasseo, gamers and gamerettes."
It's O.G. Pwnzr coming to you live from New York City with your daily dose of...
(imitates explosion) knowledge.
"Today I'm gonna introduce you to the newest champion for Skystrike Titans, Vadrus Typhon."
"He is a complete badass, which is why all you rug rats are gonna pay big bucks for this upgrade, so you can do this... (laughs)"
"""But how do I execute that combo?"" you ask..."
"Okay, admit it, this guy's hilarious."
He's old.
"He's got to be, like, 30."
"Yeah, but, like, that's the whole point."
"He's been playing forever, so he knows all the tricks."
He's gonna be at the VGU Open this weekend.
I'm gonna play him.
I'm gonna kick his ass.
I can't believe you're wasting an entire weekend playing video games with sweaty nerdcore dweebs.
Not all of them are dweebs.
"Challenge Uncle O.G., but be warned-- you will be wrecked."
There will be pwnage.
"We have a huge viral campaign push with cell phone cross promotion, playable demos that can be e-mailed with an embedded link to the site."
"We even posted game samples on Youtube, pointing towards the pre-purchase 10-day trial link"
- Brian.
- All right.
"I just wanted to add that Dave and I are scheduled to be on ""Game Gab"" tomorrow."
"Oh, that's great."
Half a million hits per day.
"Um, and where are we with your deal?"
"We haven't heard from your lawyer, Adam Hillman."
Right.
Uh... we're on it.
What about the bugs in the game?
"Dave, how are we doing on the bug thing?"
Dave?
The level three bugs?
It's bug.
Singular.
"It means, uh, it's all being resolved."
- We'll be ready for the duplicators
- Without a doubt?
We--we--just I.M.Ing the guys at the--at the shop.
It's gonna be fine.
It's all under control.
"""All under control""?"
That's the best you got?
It's a glitch in the code.
We'll figure it out.
"It could tank the whole game, Dave."
"Yeah, kinda like the fact that we don't have a signed contract which we would have if you actually talked to Adam instead of sticking his face under the sofa."
"Well, he started it."
"""He started it""?"
"What are you, 12?"
Show him your cardigan.
"Do something."""
"I've got to say something to Jay-Z, so I said this, ladies and gentlemen"
"I said this to the world's biggest rapper. ""Jay-Z!"""
LAUGHTER
I went for a high five with the world's biggest rapper.
"I'm thinking ""You look a right knob now!"
"""You look an absolute penis here!"
"He's not going to give you a high five."""
But he did.
"He gave me the high five Bang, yeah, pretty good!"
APPLAUSE Come here.
Come here.
"Come here, look."
Whoa!
"Feel pretty good now, don't you?"
"It's in a sort of six degrees of separation way, right?"
You have just touched the hand that's touched the hand that has touched Beyonce's knockers.
"Yeah, pretty good, eh?"
Have another go.
"Go on, go on."
"Get lost, she's not a slag."
She's not a slag.
"If you liked it, you should've put a ring on it."
It's your own fault.
"I've been in pantomime, but the one thing I did learn, and I'm going to teach you tonight, is the three secret moves."
There's three secret dance moves.
They're brilliant.
You'll go to any panto this Christmas or any am-dram show and you'll see these three moves.
Here's the first move you require if you want to be in any amateur dramatics dance show - the side sway
LAUGHTER
The second one is a bit more difficult.
I can't afford that.
"Afford it you will, Mr. Newman or this court will see that your car is impounded and sold at auction."
"Well, don't you worry, Your Honour."
He's in my custody.
"Well, what do you think?"
I really can't say.
"- No, say."
I want you to say.
"- It's not good, okay?"
It's not good.
You look stupid.
I'm sorry.
You have to realise this has not been custom-fitted to his scalp.
I really think this looks pretty good.
"Why not get white shoes, move to Miami Beach and get the whole thing over with?"
Maybe you could show me something else.
"As I said, it'll be different once we design something specifically for you."
But I don't think your friend here is being very helpful.
"Oh, hey."
I'm being helpful.
I am the only one being helpful.
I don't think you're being helpful!
You're being disruptive.
You make it difficult for your friend to improve his life.
I'm preventing him from becoming one of those guys people snicker at because they look ridiculous.
No offence to you personally.
You people with hair think you're so superior.
You have no idea what it's like.
You ever look in the tub and see a fistful of hair?
Start your day with that!
All right.
Take it easy.
"Did that not occur to you?"""
"She said, ""I didn't-- I didn't realize that."""
I swear that's how she talks.
"""I didn't realize that."""
"I was like, ""That's 'cause you mixed."
"""Okay, you're Black and white."
"""You don't have survival skills, you don't."
"Mm-mm."" She don't."
'Cause I'm gonna tell you something.
"Had it been like a Black chick from the hood,"
"Brooklyn, something--hey!"
"She would've been in the water with a pistol, just swimming around, you know what I'm talking about?"
Now she would have been doggy-paddling.
But she would have been swimming around.
"She would have been in the drink just like this,"
"""I will fuck a shark up."
"""Don't you touch my baby."
"""Somebody gotta pay for the hotel room."
"I ain't doing the shit."""
"And she would've had her head up like this the whole time, so her hair didn't get wet."
She's my baby.
Back to Kanye West though.
"Called me up, he was like,"
"""And, you know, I didn't call you up"
"""to, you know, knock your craft or, you know, anything,"
"""because it would be weird for me to call up"
"Richard Pryor or Jamie Foxx or one of the greats."""
"I'm like, ""Richard Pryor's dead."
He's dead.
"You can't--you can't call him."""
This is what I'm thinking in my head the whole time.
"Okay, I'm listening to this man talk about himself for 11 minutes straight."
Why?
I don't know!
"I was with Jonesy, and we were just looking Felix up on the net, just a something to do."
And his family was so stinking rich.
They just wound me up!
"People like me have to duck and die, for these blue-blood types have got it all!"
"It was just a laugh, you know?"
A little note to remind him that he wasn't so important after all!
"Not that he felt that way, as it turns out."
- You utter prick.
"- Oh, it was just a postcard!"
How was I supposed to know he'd bloody kill himself?
You couldn't have known.
He must have been unstable... like his brother.
It wasn't your fault.
See?
- Did you do that?
- Let go of me.
- Truth!
Did you do that to him?
- He did it to himself.
"I sat by him for days, weeks."
I knew that he was still alive inside.
"I knew that he'd be ashamed of what he did, ashamed of his weakness."
I knew that he'll tell me who's to blame
"Imagine being like Felix... paralysed, powerless!"
You'd hurt whoever you could!
You wanted Felix to name names.
We were the last people to piss him off.
But it doesn't justify his suicide.
And it doesn't justify this revenge.
Perhaps you're right.
- This in an eight and a half.
- Nothing for Sylvie?
No.
We don't have the coral in an eight and a half.
So I brought the taupe and the black.
And this is a similar style in ivory with a strap.
"Oh, I don't want the strap."
I didn't think you would.
I just wanted you to see it.
"Yeah, I would just feel silly with the strap."
I'm a grown woman.
"Well, sure."
But I'm contractually obligated... to at least try to sell you shoes.
How are the boys?
Are you guys all settled in there?
My boys are great.
They're great at being boys.
Kids are so adaptable.
- Am I adaptable?
- Yes.
"Yes, well... they have absolutely no control over their own lives, so-"
"But if things were reversed... you know, like that movie Freaky Friday... you can be sure Pam and I would be sent to our rooms for all our fighting."
"Yes, they would give us a time-out... and tell us we could not come out until we had really thought about what we had done."
What have we done?
But... there are no time-outs.
There's not enough time fortime-out.
"Is the sale just for clothes, or is it for other things too?"
It's a storewide sale.
"Fifteen minutes, Sylvie."
How do they feel?
Where are the Braun handheld blenders... that were advertised in the Sunday supplement?
- Is it a classic instrument?
He'll be in anton's blindness soon.
"Run hourly checks, because when he does go blind, he won't be able to tell us."
We'll use the data to construct a timeline so we can see how far behind joe he is.
Why are you still here?
You're being cautious.
You're being... common.
When you don't give a crap about... how many of your guys have caught cancer from their patients?
Let me know when that happens.
Then we can have this conversation.
"It's just another case, huh?"
"Gee, I bet you can even have unprotected sex with your cancer patients without catching a damn thing."
"Boy, I wish I had your job."
Biopsy showed nothing.
How can there be nothing?
You cut out a piece of my brain.
It's nothing personal.
We just didn't find anything.
Can you up his morphine for god's sake?
"He's already maxed out,20 milligrams per hour."
What about toxins?
Everything was negative.
There was a cupboard above the stove.
Did you see it?
"I didn't check all the food, but could be listeriosis."
We didn't go back.
Follow right.
Who did?
House said we shouldn't go.
Too dangerous.
The answer's gotta be in that apartment.
Not going is too dangerous!
I'm sorry.
"Excuse me, but what is your deal?"
I rather not discuss it.
- Why not?
"- That's my business, that's why not."
What's the big...
I thought for sure they'd send professionals.
They did!
Then why is it matter what I don't want to discuss?
Wouldn't you be curious if you were us?
There's a place around the corner if you need more ammo.
- We got ammo.
- Then let's get this show on the road.
Expecting company.
- What kind of company?
"- Rather not say, except to say we probably don't wanna be here when they arrived."
- They?
"Who's ""they""?"
- Is this an interview or a hit?
Whatever man.
You got anymore cookies?
"Maybe, maybe not."
"How about this, if you shoot me, I'll tell you where they are,"
- and I'll throw in the recipe.
- How are you gonna do that dead?
- Start shooting and find out.
- Hardy har har.
"Excuse me, I need to confer with my colleague."
- Again?
"- Yea, again."
Don't worry I won't move this time.
"I'll be right here, when you get back."
"I know we gotta off this guy, cos that's what we gotta do."
"""Nobody walk around with your shoes off."""
Are you sure?
"When I heard the glass break, I immediately threw on my bathing suit."
Was that for nothing?
Where's the glass?
Yay!
"Get these ""save the dates"" for people's weddings."
You guys know what I'm talking about.
"The ""save the dates."""
When did this start?
Why did this start?
"Why was someone like, ""You know what?"
"In advance of the invitation, let's send our friends a ""save the date,' as to say, ""Psst!"
Heads up.
Invitation on the way.
You're one of the chosen ones.
That's right.
Identical information on both pieces of paper.
"Except on that save the date, you're gonna get a pretty cool, insecure picture of the two of us."
That's a magnet.
Put that on the fridge.
"Decorate your home with our faces.'"""
"You see those pictures, you're like, ""Oh, fuck."
"I can't go to this."""
"They're just looking at you like, ""This is what love is, right?"
"We're in a field in the middle of nowhere, standing next to an abandoned barn."
Come to our wedding.
Look at us.
"We're spooning backwards while standing, laughing about something one of us brought up."
Be at our wedding!
"Look, we're on a dock in the middle of a lake."
We don't even live near a lake.
I've been through all my clients and there's lots of prospects.
There's something about a group of tree hugging horsey people on a mission.
But have you even thought about what's gonna happen when all these people start showing up?
Matt's gonna know.
"I mean, they have to deal with him."
"Well, I've got time to talk Matt around."
"Actually, you don't have any time at all."
I just heard.
Meat truck's coming... tomorrow.
Hi there.
"Um, nice to see you again."
Will-will Clint be joining us today?
"Actually, my boss is on vacation, so all twelve of your emails were forwarded to me."
"Judging by the content of some of them, I'm sure you weren't aware."
So how would you like to go about these interviews?
"Well, protocol states that I should start with you and Peter."
Of course.
"Um, separately."
Oh.
Okay.
"Um, who would you like to..."
interrogate first?
You.
"And Mrs. Morris, this is not an interrogation."
This is for the good of your child.
It's okay.
There you go.
"That doesn't hurt, now, does it?"
You don't think I'd hear about what you're up to?
It's a small town!
You're just supposed to make sure these horses are healthy.
Not break them.
"Yes, you heard me."
Of course you won't believe it as you're seeing me here talking nicely.
I can assure you at that time I'd see those news in which..
"A man kills his wife while she sleeps, you know..."
And I could understand them completely.
I surely would've killed her.
We got along pretty well...
Well I congratulate you because for me it was real hell.
Thank God!
Thank God I divorced on time.
"If not, I don't know how could have ended."
"I'm telling you, I had these terrible thoughts... tremendous!"
Did you manage everything patiently?
More or less.
Believe me I'm jealous.
She told me that if I was leaving she'd bring charges for abandonment of the home.
Do what you want!
That she'd get the children custody...
It's alright keep them all!
Look.
In my wrist.
Can you see a little sample of what happened the last day?
She almost break my arm!
She hit me with the iron machine and I thought she broke my arm.
"Actually, she tried to hit me in the head, so I took the iron machine from her and I hit her!"
I left her lying on the floor.
It was all messed up.
We fucked up everything.
I remember wondering if she was dead...
But not at all!
She just got some stitches.
Of course I didn't see her.
I feel a lot of pressure Right now.
"I mean, building a legacy For the pomrenkes."
Is what it's all about.
That's why I get out there And work as hard as I do.
That's all that's On my mind right now.
70 miles northwest...
I left my gun on my table.
I love that gun.
We got all the dredging.
That's the more important Than my gun.
"The fighting Kellys Are rolling the dice,"
Going where many believe They'd wind up anyway...
I've never River mined before.
I've wanted to do this For a long time.
Up a river.
I know we're going up against A lot of unknowns today.
And I know that It's gonna be a bitch.
So far this season...
I was wondering If it'd be a possibility.
If I could get My family on your claim.
I just don't think I want to Take a chance on you.
"Due to their Less than stellar reputation,"
The kellys have struggled To gain access to claims.
"Well, I haven't heard Any kind of good."
From anybody on you guys.
"Okay, well, thank you."
And even when they have...
Seriously?
It hasn't lasted long.
We don't have Anywhere else to work.
Could you imagine The old miners.
Having to walk out here Back in the day?
"So, since god planned for us to have peace and happiness in this life right now,"
why are so many of us hurting and angry inside?
It's because we refuse to believe in god's unconditional love for us.
God created us in his image for one reason only -- so that we could know him personally and have a joy-filled life.
That's it.
There's no catch.
There's no hidden agenda.
"The lord sacrificed his only son for us, paying the penalty for our sins so that we might know true contentment."
"Sounds too good to be true, but it isn't."
God's provided the way.
We must make the choice.
Excuse me.
Paige!
"Hi, sweetheart."
Wow.
You look so beautiful.
You must be Paige's parents.
Such an honor to meet you.
Your daughter has been such a blessing to us.
"She's a blessing to us, too."
Paige says you work in travel.
Yeah.
"Well, we take a mission trip every year."
We should talk.
"Yeah, we -- yeah, we should."
We'd love it if Paige could join us on one of our trips -- see all the good her generous donations are doing.
We'll definitely talk about that.
Martha.
I was just about to ruin your sunday and call you in to help me.
"Well, Agent Gaad beat you to it."
What do you need?
There was a meeting between the D.O.D.
That and breast-feeding.
It just comes natural to 'em.
"So, Hadji's girlfriend finally came to her senses."
What happened?
She didn't wanna be a fifth wife?
[Laughing]
- Hadji.
- All right.
"Well, it's her loss."
The girls in my Friday night cribbage game... will be thrilled to have Fez back at the table.
You know what?
At least Fez has a social life.
Look at us.
We're hanging out with my parents.
"Yeah, about that."
Feel free to get the hell out.
"Well, we can do better than this."
"You guys, we're gonna graduate in two months... and there is a whole town out there just waiting for us."
"We just have to, you know, grab the bull by the horns."
"Okay, but I tell you this from experience."
"If we're gonna mess with the bull, we better have an escape plan."
"Well, what are the popular kids doing tonight?"
"Well, I'll bet they're not hanging around with their parents... giving them snarky looks."
I remember when the Brady kids got bored... and then that fat kid Oliver showed up.
[Chuckles]
It just all turned around.
They got in a pie fight and everything.
You know what?
Kelso might actually be onto something.
Maybe we should look for someone new to hang out with.
All right!
We're gettin' a fat kid!
It wasn't the right code.
Tell me you killed the girl before you figured that out.
What?
Fuck!
They got to the emergency phones.
Just let me think.
"No one even knows we're in trouble, do they?"
"No, they don't."
"- There has to be a safety measure, right?"
- No.
- Something or someone?
- There's nothing.
Someone who cancels the broadcast when something like this happens.
There's no one.
"There has to be some kind of back-up, like an emergency back-up..."
Something like this doesn't happen.
"Seventy years, the code's never been breached."
Somebody has to be out there who can...
"Katherine, there's nothing but the goddamn numbers!"
"If we do our job, we get out of here alive."
I promise.
"You kill her for me, I let you live."
No.
We've gone to a lot of trouble here with these broadcasts.
We can't leave anything to chance.
We can't let the girl cancel the broadcasts.
She's the only one who can undo what's been done.
"You understand that, you're not a fool."
Go fuck yourself.
"Look, your bosses won't let her live."
She knows too much.
Either you or me or the Agency pulls the trigger.
Talking snow.
I love new things.
You are not of this world.
Takes one to SNOW one!
"Right, let's see."
"Multi-nucleate, crystalline organism with the ability to mimic and mirror what it finds."
Looks like snow.
Isn't snow.
You must leave here now!
"Shut up, I'm making deductions, it's very exciting."
"Now, what are you, eh?"
A flock of space crystals?
A swarm?
"The snowmen are foot soldiers, mindless predators."
But you - you're the clever one.
You're Moriarty.
"So you turn up on a planet, you generate a telepathic field to learn what you can, and when you've learnt enough, what do you do?"
You can't conquer the world using snowmen.
Snowmen are rubbish in July.
You'll have to be better than that.
You'll have to evolve.
"Sir, it appears to be stuck!"
What have you done?
Have you locked the doors?
"You need to translate yourself into something more, well, human."
Kick it down!
To do that you'd need a perfect duplicate of human DNA in ice form - where do you find that?
Get in here!
Quickly!
"I've got a master key somewhere, sir."
Let's see.
Most opened file...
Let's see what we find here.
"All right, looks like your basic super model diet."
"Diet pills, vodka, cigarettes."
Gabriel.
At least this confirms that she was here.
- No sign of a struggle.
- No sign of anything.
- What about blood?
- No.
All right.
"Well, I guess we're done here."
Somebody's coming.
Hey!
Hi!
"If you guys were planning a party, you could have at least put me on the guest list."
"All right, who's going to tell me what's going on?"
- It's best if you don't know.
- Best if I don't know what?
Telling you would kind of defeat the purpose of 'it's best if you don't know'.
"Okay, you two have been skulking around the city for two days."
I want to know what's going on.
I can't believe neither of them would tell me what was going on!
This is a little hard to picture.
Mike and Henry are hanging out..
"No, not just hanging out, they're working together."
They're investigating that fashion model murder.
You know what drives me crazy?
They didn't even want me involved.
"They didn't want my help, nothing."
"Yeah, there's nothing worse than when you find out somebody close to you doesn't trust you."
"It's not the same thing, Coreen."
Of course not.
Bend closer to each other!
"I can't, that paunch..."
"Mummy, look how she dances."
Dad's like a sea wolf.
So slow?
You could do one of those amorous dances.
I wouldn't have anyone to do it with.
So that's what you mean by an amorous dance?
"Yes, on the same spot."
You see!
Then this hand must go somewhere else.
Like this?
In my pocket?
"Yes, to get your purse."
They teach you to dance that?
Then show us how you think it should be.
"You must stand on the spot, just slowly moving and swaying..."
Then I'll be your boy.
I'm the boy and you must slowly sway...
Do you remember how we practised that polka with Mi?
ka?
I didn't like her then.
Then she wanted that tango.
"Goodness, she was encouraging me to get so close, so amorous, body to body."
Seriously!
Some shake-up dance like the tango suits her better than a polka.
"Goodness, what do you see in it?"
"There are emotions in the tango, the impression of being in love."
"Heavens, what emotions are you talking about?"
What do you know about being in love?
"Not me, but I think it applies to her."
"Goodness, you'd do better to buy her that material for a dress!"
You got to listen to that shit all day?
You get used to it.
"Yeah, we're gonna go ahead and put you in this air cast."
It's gonna keep everything stabilized until the doctor can examine it.
"Zach, I wasn't trying to hurt you, dude."
"I thought I heard you yell ""all clear."""
"Oh, and this has nothing to do with the fact that I've king to Ashley?"
"I'm sick of your passive aggressive bullshit, Nate."
I'm sorry she likes me more.
We have common interests.
Deal with it.
"Hey, hey, take it easy, buddy."
Don't tell me to take it easy.
I'm seeing clearly for the first time in ages.
My ex-best friend just broke my leg.
I think I might break my own leg if I had to listen to this song all day.
- Right?
"- Take me away now, please."
I've got some thinking to do.
"Yes, sir."
I can't get that goddamn carousel song out of my head.
Torture.
"Yep, that's the one."
"Okay, okay."
♪ I am riding on a little pony ♪
♪ Both my friends are sitting right beside me ♪
"♪ One's on a zebra, one's on a lion ♪"
"♪ Boy, this carousel sure is flying ♪"
"T, I would just die if somebody that I cared about was maybe dying and I didn't really have a chance to tell them how much I loved them."
Yeah.
"You know what we got to do, T."
"Starting right now, we got to tell people right in the moment how much they mean to us."
"We got knocked down, but we got right back up."
"You can see that my right arm's gone, yet here I stand tall on my own two feet!"
"The Berolina Statue, the old symbol of Berlin, high above the Alexanderplatz ― they tore it down."
It's no longer standing.
Why?
"It was metal on the outside, but hollow inside."
But... this little gizmo here ― this gave me the idea.
They can knock it down and turn it on its head ― it always gets back on its feet.
That's right.
It has metal where it counts.
"Think about it, folks."
Metal where it counts.
"You get knocked over, but you'll always get back on your feet ― as long as a man's got two legs to stand on."
"But it's not a man's legs that matter, or his arms, but what he's got in here!"
The Story of Franz Biberkopf
Administration of Tegel prison
"Good luck, Biberkopf."
"Come on, leave."
What's the matter with you?
I don't know.
I just can't keep up with this.
"Come on, we'll go and drink some korn."
Even such things are still around.
Where did he go with my suitcase?
I think you got mugged.
They even stole that one.
There is nothing left for me now.
But that doesn't matter.
- At least you can't lose anything.
Haven't seen you in a while.
A beer and two rissoles.
Because I didn't think anybody would be here!
I thought that Jabbar and his men would be trying -- trying to kill me!
"Look, I have millions invested in here!"
I was just trying to salvage something!
"I thought they were gone, and then a couple of guys came back."
How many?
How many guys?
Three?
Five?
I don't know!
Just get down here!
"That doesn't sound good, Sam."
I know.
"When planning an escape, patience is key."
"Someone without training might jump at the first chance to strike, but that's exactly the wrong time, because that's when your enemy's most alert."
"In fact, the best time to make your move is after you've let plenty of other opportunities go by."
The other advantage of patience is it gives you a chance to find out if the situation has changed.
What happened?
"We were on our way to his house, and my -- my men called."
He snuck into his warehouse.
"He was hiding in his office, crying like a woman."
We got the pig.
Now you'll get to see him bleed.
I been waiting for so long.
It's been 10 months since you helped my whore of a wife run away from me.
10 months.
Now I think...
My waiting is done.
"Look, I-I don't -"
"- I don't know where she is, okay?"
That's a lie.
"No, l-listen, okay?"
Could we please just turn those lights down a little?
You need them for the public-access cameras.
I know.
It's unfortunate.
Nobody looks good in high def.
"You know, if you would like to address this council as a citizen, you can go ahead and wait at..."
Could you stop with the fucking spotlight?
"Celia, check the language at the door."
Families are watching.
"You know, I know what you're trying to do."
"I know what you're all trying to do, and it's not gonna work."
I don't need you to like me.
How about we put this to a vote?
"All those who don't like Celia, say ""aye."""
Aye.
The public has spoken.
Damn it!
"- Saturday's Dad's birthday, you know."
- I know.
"Well, we have a lot to do to get ready."
Maybe we'll scale down on the party a little this year.
- Last year was kind of a lot.
- What did you guys do last year?
"Ate his favorite food, watched his favorite movies, and beat the shit out of a piñata."
That's right.
He always did have a thing for piñatas.
"- Did he ever hit you, Nancy?"
- I'm not filled with candy.
"So, what's the plan?"
"We'll do something, maybe just not the full-on, all-day celebration."
Why can't we just do what we did last year?
I'm not sure I can handle it.
"And I thought, ""Well, this won't go well, I probably shouldn't."""
"But I thought, ""Well, what would my mother say?"""
LAUGHTER
"I thought, ""Well, she'd say, 'Yes'"", so I said, ""Yes"", and I snorted this not overgenerous line, and I realised, as soon as I'd done this,"
"that this wasn't cocaine, as we know it."
"It was burning at the back of my nose, and I said to this man, ""What was that?"""
"He said, ""Oh, it's crystal meth,"""
and crystal meth...
Phone your mum.
LAUGHTER
"I mean, it makes you very, shall we say, uninhibited."
And I realised I'd been groomed by this man.
"He'd sent his friend along, cos then he was able to approach me."
They were working in tandem?
I was more receptive.
And I went off with this man...
and I'll just jump ahead three days.
LAUGHTER
Please don't.
"No, you don't want to know."
"Oh, we do."
I came too in a multistorey car park in Harlem.
"Oh, what bad luck, Julian."
"Well, there's a..."
You know...
LAUGHTER
"You go to a club, have some drugs with someone you've never met before and then all hell breaks loose."
It wasn't what I was expecting.
Were you in a car?
"I was near, shall we say, an open boot."
Were you?
"But, there's a sequel to this."
Mr.Smith. Mr.Hilliard.
"Ambrose, you must see, you, me, the industry, we are all at the service of the war."
"""The War""? ""The War""?"
Damn bloody war.
The war has skimmed off the cream and we are left with the rancid curse.
I'm sorry I took so long.
There was a bomb crater on the Millibar Road.
Oh!
No one told me there was a meeting.
No.
We rather tried to keep this under wraps at present.
"It seems that there's someone in this disdain department, who knows there's someone who says that the Starling sisters never got to Dunkirk."
That their engine broke down before they even were out of British waters.
Pity.
Pity all around really.
Your first draft bore it so well.
"Actually, the Starking sisters lied."
What difference does it really make?
God sake!
Of course it makes a difference!
It's not the truth!
"The truth is, they stole a boat from a man, who terrified them and... set out to cross 50 miles of open sea into a war."
They never got there!
Because their engine failed!
Now that's a truth we won't be telling.
Moral sapping apparently.
We pick our truths.
Isn't that the point?
"We are saying, this is based on a true story."
We don't!
For Christ above man!
You are supposed to be a propagandist.
"My padre, which is Spanish for father..."
Oh.
I see.
[ Laughter ]
Owns and built racecar tracks.
"So ever since I was a little girl, we'd go to the auto shows and, you know, he would show me about cars."
And I always pretended that...
"I mean, this was our big bonding moment all the time in the year."
"So, I get really into it, and then I realized as I got older and he'd be like, ""why don't you want to race?"""
"You know, I'd be like, ""I'm the actress."
"I'm not gonna do that,"" you know?"
"But really, I think I was just really scared, which is why today is so tough."
"So, I just was always interested in them, had an opinion a about what I liked, what I didn't like."
"So, if you know what you like in a car, what is it?"
What makes a great car to you?
I am definitely attracted to...
"We're talking aesthetics, too."
I drive a mini.
I've driven a mini.
Now I've had three minis.
And what kind of driver would you say you are in that mini?
"Yeah, I drive really aggressively."
"It's like a video game to you, right?"
"Yeah, it's tetris."
I call it tetris driving.
Oh.
[ Laughter ]
"It's basically, I love traffic-tetris driving because you have to make traffic fun."
Right.
And traffic out here is awful.
Yeah.
It's so bad.
That's my business.
But you...
I don't know what the hell you think you're trying to do.
"Well, I'm trying to fight a war."
I'm trying to get these people off this rock in one piece.
"Anything for the cause, Major."
"Gaius, I am on the verge of seeing the faces of the final five cylons."
Maybe the face of God himself.
"... the five lights of the apocalypse rising, struggling towards the light..."
Scenes revealed only to those who enter the temple.
Only to the chosen one.
The chosen one.
The chosen one.
The five await me.
"Gaius, I'm so close to knowing the truth."
What truth ?
Caprica.
I'd like to think that we three have shared something.
Transcended the barriers that separate people.
"And yet, somehow, the more time goes on, the more I find myself on the outside looking in."
"Well, that's not the case at all."
Is it ?
"Because we three, we're integral."
We're part of...
We're finished.
"Baltar's and my destiny lie separate from yours, Caprica."
The five lights will be revealed only to those who enter the temple.
We have to go down to the planet.
"Only you and I, can see this through."
What are you after ?
What is this secret that you keep pursuing ?
You have to tell me the truth.
"Not modern, just something better, we're not so poor we can't afford it."
We paid for it and what happened?
Did I need a dance for that?
It was all your fault.
is this how one imagines life will be?
is this what you prepared for us?
"You invited me, so I went."
"We did, but what are you telling me!"
Then where am I to go with you?
It wasn't the expense I minded.
Should I go to the cemetery with you?
That won't cost anything.
And you can be sad there!
And you can be quiet there.
It'd be just the right place for you.
"All my youth, with you..."
What did I get from it?
Youth!
Did you think you'd always be young?
When did I have a good time?
When did I go to a party?
When could I afford anything?
I came from Prague during the Protectorate.
First I went to school and then...
You could add that first you were born.
Let's begin at the beginning.
"Go on, say it was a pity we went there."
So we were there.
That was all we experienced and then it was over.
Nineteen fifty-three came and we went broke.
"But you kept saying, it'll be all right..."
"You philosophized, speculated, until you overdid it and lost all."
Away from all the problems of the world.
I think I might have brought my problems with me.
Away you go then.
It's just that I want to write something.
"Well, then write it!"
About Trina.
"Ah, right."
"A life must be worth a few well chosen words more than just ""Body found in car."""
"Yeah, but there are so many rumours flying around now."
You can't even see the ducks from the trees.
I think you might find the expression is 'wood from the trees'.
It doesn't even make any sense.
Trees are made of wood.
"Yeah, yeah that's the point."
"Nah, I still don't get it."
"But anyway, back to your problem."
"Which is essentially that if I, if I write only the bare facts,"
I feel like I would have done her and injustice.
"Yeah, but on the other hand you don't want to upset anyone and you know, go into messy, gory details."
"No, I don't want to do that."
I was out here the other morning and right before my eyes
I saw two dolphins mating.
It was beautiful.
Beautiful!
But also a bit disturbing.
"Yeah, I can imagine."
"And when they get, you know, quite passionate, they actually bite each other's fins."
Quite badly.
It can scar them for life.
Is that what happened?
"Nah, nah, nah, a killer whale appeared and chased them off."
And me.
"Mondale and Ferraro, path to equality."
"No, thanks."
"What are you, a Republican?"
"Oh, I'm sorry, did you catch it from your parents?"
I hear it's hereditary.
I guess I did.
"Well, if you don't want a pamphlet, here, have a pin, on me."
"I might wear it, but only because it's stylish."
"You know, if you're not a pamphlet reader, I could take you to coffee tell you all about why Mondale and Ferraro are gonna lose."
"If you're so sure they're gonna lose, why bother?"
"I don't know, it feels right."
So... coffee?
KIRSTEN:
I guess I had fate on my mind when I got you this gift.
Where on Earth did you find this?
I turned the house upside down.
"If it hadn't been for Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro, there never would have been a Seth Cohen."
There wouldn't be a Ryan.
And whoever this is going to be...
All because of that one day.
My lucky day.
My lucky day.
"Okay, I admit it-- I put way too much stock into that poem."
I'm not the girl that you thought I was.
You're not.
"You, Summer, are better."
"See, back then you were just this fantasy."
"You were this little girl, who, when I would see, you would either ignore me, or make an obscene gesture and keep on walking."
"Yeah, I kind of remember that, sorry."
But now look at you.
You fight for sea otters.
You've befriended Taylor Townsend.
You will be put to work on the harbor expansion project.
We will do anything you tell us.
We will find you a way to make a living after the pirates are suppressed.
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
"Head Chief, how could you do this to me?"
What have I done to deserve this?
Shut up!
"I know you tried to take your men, and surrender to Jang Bogo."
Slit his throat.
We also need to build a warehouse to store cargo.
Find a suitable place not far from the harbor.
Yes.
My lady.
I hear that many pirates are surrendering.
Why don't we hire them to work for us?
"Father, how can you trust them?"
What will you do if they steal from us?
No one was born a pirate.
They were forced into pirating to feed themselves.
"You should hate the crime, not the man."
They are skilled martial arts experts.
"With the right guidance, they will make good traveling merchants."
"Isn't that right, my lady?"
You are right.
- Find a way to hire them.
"- Yes, my lady."
Why are you so late?
I had to run some errands for Lady Chae-ryung.
Why did you wish to see me?
Why else?
Because I missed you...
"Well, then why were you staring?"
It was hard to miss.
"Trust me, Salvadore is the least of our problems."
It's freezing in here.
Why would they make a room like this?
You should have seen my masseuse.
She was so hot.
You're supposed to be relaxing out here.
Why do you think I wanted to get a full release?
You know what?
I don't even want to get into this with you.
Into what?
I don't want to get into this conversation with you.
Why is that?
"Because I don't want to be put in a position where l,d have to lie."
Why are you getting all high and mighty on me?
"No, I'm not so high and mighty."
"Joey, I'm not judging you,"
I'm just not asking anything because
I don't want...
I don't want to know.
"Because that way, if someone asks me..."
You won't have to rat me out.
I would never rat you out.
Of course I wouldn't't rat you out.
"Right, right."
"But this way, I don't have to make that decision because I really don't know."
"All right, let me ask you something, then."
"Could you honestly say that after seven years together, that you get turned on by the same woman?"
I do.
Without going to the highlight reel.
You're playing a verbal shell game.
Do i get flowers even after a rehearsal?
"Well, i've got to send them here until i'm able to hand them to you over the footlights."
"Well, you've always got some excuse."
"Oh, jim, really, you're spoiling me with presents."
Every day it's something new.
No wonder mr.
Boyd criticizes me.
"Oh, now, he doesn't."
"Oh, yes, he does."
"No, he criticizes me because he thinks i don't know anything about women."
"Do you, jim?"
I know all i want to know about one.
But why does he avoid me?
"If i bring him here, will you be nice to him, josie, for my sake?"
"You know, it kind of worries me, the way you two have always got your claws out."
"No, i don't think you'd better... let's forget about mr."
Boyd.
Here he is!
We looked for you at the theater and the rehearsal was over- we knew sooner or later we'd find you here.
"Well, stop moaning and tell me what's up."
Vanderbilt's got the law on us.
What?
He got an injunction so we can't print any more stock.
An injunction?
It's worse than that.
We've sold more stock than we can deliver.
We're cornered.
I told you to watch out for that.
He that sells what isn't his'n must pay it back or go to prison.
"Oh... don't worry, everything is fine, josie."
Certainly- we're in a fine fix.
And this is a fine place to do business.
The harm's already done.
You behave... like a hooligan.
That's what I had in mind.
You might have warned me.
"Since you were there, it's all right."
You really have changed.
I thought you were a good citizen... like in the days we were studying.
You change according to your place.
"Because of your job... private companies,"
you work hard...
"Balla, you should never treat a friend so badly."
I've never been so serious.
"Private companies, then... you work hard... and make nothing."
Who told you that?
You've never worked... for the public sector.
You work very little and make ten times more... than in the private sector.
"If you don't believe me, then that's that..."
Listen!
You know very well... that while not in the public sector... my salary is more than enough... and I don't need more to get by.
You disappoint me.
"Hi, Tiekoura!"
"Hi, boss!"
How are you?
Any news?
The young ones came to tell me about a meeting.
Organized by the new engineer?
We have no confidence in him.
"With or without your confidence, let's listen to him."
We'll judge him by his actions.
He doesn't have to be like the ones before.
For sure.
Let's go and listen to him.
"It's sad, really, to see a once-mediocre realtor reduced to this."
"Gil, please, let's keep this civil."
"Oh, by the way, if you ever speak disrespectfully again about my wife, I'll kill you."
Sorry.
That sounded like a joke.
I will actually kill you.
"Anyhoo, when you guys wake up and smell the sulfur, here's a list of other realtors, and if you need me, I'll be in the office at 9:00..."
"Uh, 10:00."
I have the dentist.
Where did that come from?
Life's too short to be ruled by fear.
"What do you say we get you the right dryer, princess?"
"Oh, my."
"I mean, Phil is usually just so..."
"But then he was just, like, so..."
And then he got even more...
There's nothing I can do.
- I can't go for that.
- No can do.
Cameron here bought an eggshell dryer.
"Not white, not oatmeal, not Swiss-coffee, not baby-powder, not bone."
Eggshell.
"Look, Rob, is it?"
That's interesting.
Here's how this is going down...
We don't leave without that eggshell dryer.
"Not swan-feather, not Chester-pig-white."
I think we've covered the colors.
I sell houses to people every day who ask me where they should buy their dryer.
I don't think you want me giving them any... static.
I may have one in the back.
"But it takes two guys to load the truck, and it's just me today."
"From then on,any time he was in town, he was with me."
How often did you see him?
He would come and go a lot.
But I understood.
That's how it is with special ops.
Lance corporal finn's record does not indicate he was involved with special operations.
He said his missions were top secret.
"He wanted to tell me more, but he didn't want to put me in danger."
When'd you last see lance corporal finn?
Six months ago.
Before he left for iraq.
- How'd you meet?
- At a bar.
Two years ago.
"I was there with some girlfriends, and when I got up to go to the ladies' room, he blocked my path, said he couldn't keep his eyes off me."
And that worked?
"What worked is that when we talked, he had something to say."
"Most guys won't shut up about their online war games, but this guy,he had seen real action."
"And I was feeling patriotic that night, so I invited him to come home with me."
The sex was fantastic.
When did you two get enged?
About a week before he left.
"James wanted to borrow $30,000."
Did he tell you what the money was for?
Gambling debts.
"And if he didn't pay,they were gonna hurt him."
Who?
He said it was better if I didn't know.
Because of the danger.
"Look,didn't give him the money."
I loaned it to him.
So you drew up a gal document?
- Bastard!
I command you by the judge of the living and the dead to depart from this servant of God.
It's the power-
- Holy water.
It's the power of Christ that compels you.
-The power of Christ compels you!
-The power of Christ compels you!
-The power of Christ compels you!
-The power of Christ compels you!
-The power of Christ compels you!
-The power of Christ compels you!
-The power of Christ compels you!

"Idiot, they must be looking for us."
In one or two days...
Until then we'll have to put it somewhere no one can see.
"I have an idea, What?"
"This is gas, Why did you put it in here?"
See nobody can see it here.
"This car is here for sale, what if somebody comes to buy it?"
"Nobody came to buy it for seven months, who will come now..."
A man's death and another woman over a woman.
"Once catches up with you, it never lets go."
And Yadav's death is catching up to him.
Kill him.
Who shall we send?
"After Heera's murder, Police in Pondi is alert."
I've heard that you have a vacancy for a shooter.
Give my son a chance to do a murder.
I want him to get settled before I'm dead.
His career gets developed.
Give this target to my Laxmi.
I'll do my best.
Give me one chance.
"And if he fails this time, he's not of one father, I tell you."
A sparkling rose and loose motion never stays forever.
This time I'm sure that Laxminarayan will come back with job done.
"Bhai, I won't forget your kindness."
Bullet will go off so neatly even you won't be able to notice.
But who's the target?
"Poets have poetry, walls have ears."
Leave for Pondi.
Your room will be booked in blue diamond hotel.
You'll get a envelope there.
Whoever's address and photo is in the envelope.
"At this moment, I can't say."
I will be in touch.
Thank you.
She's gone!
"I came back from the Station House to set up for the show,"
- and she was gone.
- Has this happened before?
She's never been set free.
I don't know what she's capable of.
"This lock, it's faulty."
Did you not notice?
"Sure if I noticed, I would have fixed it, wouldn't I?"
This means the girl could have gotten out the night of the murder.
(indistinct chatter)
Constables will pair off and search for this girl in an orderly fashion.
The local farmers who are upset about their dead livestock will be joining us.
"The armoury has been opened, but only use force if necessary."
"Having said that, be cautious."
This girl could be vicious.
"Crabtree, bring the lads up to speed."
(small chuckle)
Our little man doesn't seem too harmed by his day with the nanny.
I won't be staying for dinner;
I'm joining the search for the missing young woman.
You think she could be the killer?
"I don't know, but I'd rather a mob didn't decide."
- Still have no idea who she is?
- No.
"But in spite of Mr. Travis' claims, she wasn't always feral."
"At the very least, she had a mother who gave birth to her."
"Yes, she did."
"- Are we ready, men?"
Is that what your girlfriend's gonna do?
Alice isn't being called.
Alice ain't your girlfriend.
"The therapist,dr."
"Thorpe, or didn't she tell you she was being deposed?"
Of course she told me.
"You're sleeping with her, so she'll say nice things about you at the deposition.Smart."
"See,I don't have that option."
A--we're not sleeping together.
Sad but true.B-- she's a therapist.She's got privilege.
She can't say anything.
I don't trust her.
I'm not paying.You lost it.
You pay.
"Kids,kids,kids!"
I'm not gonna support you!
We have them dry-cleaned.
"Well, not this one."
Someone was filling these jugs with something.
There's fresh teeth marks from a wrench here.
I pull the damn pipe out.
"What, do they wash the costumes in the sink?"
Drain the liquid into the jugs?
"Ms. Brandt, we need to see the, uh, bills of lading for the costumes from the tour."
And we're gonna need the outbound and return bills.
I didn't see Laura backstage.
I was busy with costume changes.
You were in South America with her.
With the whole company!
"Anyway, I didn't even know her."
"Every time I did see her, she was in one of those rehearsal rooms, by herself, practicing."
People told us you had a bug problem with your costumes?
!
"If you want this to finally end, yes."
"No, I can't do that."
I got pride.
I'm strong.
No woman wants a man who files a restraining order in the face of danger.
I want an erection!
"How many times in life do you get a second chance, granddad?"
A chance to fix your biggest mistake?
Fine!
I'll find someone else to make me a master swordsman.
"Riley, look up ""master swordsman."""
Private lessons.
"You know I don't like a lot of people around me when I'm sweating, oh, and not too expensive."
"Uh, we're broke."
"Oh, somebody's calling me on Skype!"
Nobody ever calls me on Skype!
"What's good, nigga?"
!
Bet you weren't expecting this face!
"I'm surprised you can still see after what I did to ya, you bitch-ass, faggot ass, bitch-ass faggot!"
"Damn it, how'd you figure out how to call me on Skype?"
!
I don't even know how to use this shit.
"Hey, nigga, I just wanted to let you know that if you not too much of a pussy-ass nigga, you can meet me tomorrow in the parking lot for a rematch!"
"Oh, and I put the word out to the whole world, so if you don't show, well, you know what that means."
You's a bitch-ass nigga!
Bitch-ass.
You's a bitch-ass nigga!
"Yeah, rock with me, Robert!"
Come on!
Something's wrong.
"Well, I thought you might need a friend."
Come and sit.
You realize that she may never talk to me again?
"I told you, 1 9 is too young to be settling down."
"You're driving me crazy, Alex, you realize that?"
Can't help it.
"I've told you, I take getting what I want for granted."
I thought you said you were trying to change that about yourself.
I believe that people should listen to their urges.
"You are a very determined woman, aren't you?"
"Everybody already thinks you did it, Pacey so why don't you just do it?"
This is great.
Too bad we have to stop.
-We have to what?
-Stop.
But what about the heat?
"Well, just knowing that we could do it, it's enough."
It is?
It is.
It would just be inappropriate.
Could you guys get a room?
It's a library.
Check this exam out.
"It's dated May 1 0, 1 982 and it's graded by my same professor."
Multivariable calculus probably hasn't changed much since then.
"Yeah, well, based on these years' notes neither has the way that he's been teaching it."
"How did you do this, get all this stuff out of the house?"
"Well, I just put it in my backpack and just walked on out of there."
What about the bylaws?
What if somebody finds out?
"Well, then, I guess I get expelled from the house."
You're willing to risk that?
Well honey nothing stays the same forever.
It's kind of like a mullet.
A thing of beauty in its day.
But I tell you what sooner or later even the party in the back has to end.
Are you telling me that I need to give up Hannah Montana?
No.
I could never do that.
Neither could Jesse or Lilly.
The only one that could ever answer that would have to be you.
Please don't say listen to my heart.
-Darling it's just...
-Or my kidney or my spleen.
Or any other vital organs.
Then what do you want me to tell you?
I want you to tell me that...
"If I give up Hannah, everything will be okay."
But I can't do that.
What I can tell you is you'll be able to go to that school with Lilly.
You'll be able to go out with Jesse without half the world hating him.
You will have to give up your privacy.
No matter where you go peoples are gonna recognize you.
And they're gonna treat you different.
Is it worth it?
Only you can decide that.
[Door closes]
"[""I'll Always Remember You"" playing]"
I always knew this day would come.
We'd be standing one by one.
With our future in our hands.
"So many dreams, so many plans."
I always knew after all these years.
"There'd be laughter, there'd be tears."
I don't need a lawyer.
I answered all the questions.
I think I've got a headache.
I wish you'd go away.
[groans]
Mom.
I don't know what got into that police officer... but don't be upset.
Everybody knows you had nothing to do with it.
Do you still want me to sit for you at the Blakes tonight?
Are you sure you're gonna be all right here alone?
"I'll be back as early as I can, Mom."
[door closes]
(Lottie) Dear Mr. Nash... the time has come when I need you.
I'm all mixed up... especially after what happened the night of the murder.
I like to keep myself busy when I'm baby-sitting.
Makes the time go by quicker.
"It was a good book, very romantic."
I couldn't wait to find out what happened.
So after I finished the book I looked around for something else to do.
You've no idea how empty the life of a baby-sitter is.
And how quiet.
It's not as if I were a teenager... with lots of friends to keep me company.
Bobby was sound asleep.
Such an angel.
And with a mother like that.
"But again, you're his father."
"I guess it takes two to tango, if you get what I mean."
That woman sure was some housekeeper.
Never saw such a mess.
"But then, I guess she didn't have time for such things."
"Dust, just like I expected."
It was funny seeing the two of us hanging there.
"Somehow her energy, her essence..."
Even they weren't sure how it happened.
"Wouldn't it have been nice, Leena, if these Warehouse field agents had bothered to figure it out before she killed one of them?"
"Lot of loose ends here, okay?"
So I'm not...
"That is why, Claudia, taking inventory is so important!"
So what are we saying?
What are we saying?
Are we saying that just Myka's image got melded with the crazy essence of Alice?
"Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying."
Looks like Myka.
Isn't Myka.
"And if we give voice to that thing, it'll trick us somehow to try to get out and that is not gonna happen."
We've done enough.
We promised each other we'd stop at $5 million.
"I'm a lying, convicted thief, Gary."
I'm breaking the promise.
"No, we're so close."
We're just a few thousand away.
It won't make any difference.
You need to see a doctor.
We don't have any insurance.
Please.
We'll be paying out of pocket.
I won't go unless we offset what that'll cost with an hour's worth of betting.
- Listen to yourself.
- You listen.
My hand can rot off.
I'm not going to any doctor.
We should take it now.
Take what?
Whatever it is they've got.
- I hope you'll let me stay with you.
- Sure.
Go and eat something first.
Good idea.
Let's go.
"Now, let's talk about you."
"Go on, tell me what happened."
What do you think happened?
The usual.
It wasn't pleasant.
"Listen, I know from a reliable source when and where Ramírez's plane is going to land."
We've been waiting for something like this.
- We'd have no problems at the airport?
"- No, I'll deal with that."
The place will be teeming with soldiers.
We'll never get close to Ramírez.
"You're not planning to shoot down that aeroplane, are you?"
- What else can we do?
- You want to kill all those innocent people?
I don't want to fight for our cause in that way.
"If we do something like that, we're no different from them."
The other passengers are as bad as Ramírez.
But they're not fighting the world.
"I agree, but sometimes you're forced to do things you abhor."
It's either the death of a few innocent men or the suffering of a whole people.
Hold on a second.
The whole thing might be a large-scale trap.
That's a risk we must take.
There will only be three of us.
I'll take Smithy and Hidalgo with me.
We'll meet just before the operation.
Any questions?
You seem so different.
- We're not.
- l think you are.
"I mean, come on, Malakai's scary."
Very scary.
What you mean by scary ?
"Kai's tough, he has to be."
But he's still got a good heart. I know.
Maybe you only think you know.
"Look, Malakai may not be the boy next door, but he's still my boy."
"He does some shit that I'm not down with sometimes, but I ain't never going to cross him offand be like everybody else."
"So, you're not down with the stuff he does, but you are down with him ?"
- That makes sense. I understand.
"- He's my friend, Sara."
You don't have to understand.
You don't have to understand.
"Listen, me and him got into some shit awhile back-- some bad shit."
Broke into a liquor store and cracked open the cash register.
"Somebody peeped us and called five-0, and we barely made it out of the store."
The cops were on our asses.
We split up and ran in different directions.
"Now, I must have been going in the wrong direction, because the cops were closing in on me."
"So, Malakai, he smashed in some car windows, set off the alarms... and turned the heat from me to him."
"I kept running, and he got caught."
The DA offered him everything but a Rolls Royce to turn my name in.
"But he didn't, and he never will."
"I stole a hat once, when I was 12."
But my Mom found it and made me give it back.
Gangsta Sara stole a hat.
Call the F.B.l.
Are you gonna turn me in ?
I think I'll wait for you to surrender.
Time tames the strongest grief.
"My father's bitter grief, rage against the world that crushed me."
I put it all behind me and forgot about them.
And I had hoped that world would forget as well.
But the world was not so kind.
"The same shackles that tied me down have now tied you down, and I am powerless to free you from it."
Father...
That jerk.
I'm the fool for having thought of him as a friend!
What are you mumbling about?
"What are you doing here, Father?"
Didn't I tell you to stay home and rest?
I can rest when I'm dead.
I should work as much as I can when I can.
"If you keep that up, you will be dead!"
Don't worry.
It's sick men like me that live to be seventy!
I won't die until you're married-no.
I mean until your children are married!
What?
!
The people are refusing to pay their taxes?
"Sir, there are riotous protests."
Imposing another tax so soon after the last collection is...
Then are you going to pay for them?
They protest bee use they don't realize the severity of their crime.
Isn't that so?
"Yes, sir."
Then what should we do?
Pardon?
You're so dense!
Think!
"Jesus Christ, Emma."
Now you listen to me.
While we were goofing around... another woman got murdered.
I am gonna get someone to take you home... and you stay there with the cop who's assigned to you.
Please don't palm me off on somebody else.
I have to talk to you.
I got to work on this full-time all the time.
Ridgely's a good cop.
He's gonna look after you.
"Is Ridgely gonna take over fucking me, too?"
Did you enjoy that?
What the hell am I to you... one of your little conquests?
I've seen your friends smirk at me.
You think I'm stupid?
What do you tell them?
You give them a full report?
Listen to me.
I'm a little bit busy right now... to be playing Romeo to your Juliet.
I have one or two minor things on my mind... not the least of which is finding this killer... before he finds you... so simmer down and stop acting... like some love-crazed teenager.
You are such a prick.
Emma...
I like you.
You're a very interesting... unusual woman.
You're so full of shit.
Don't you dare treat me like we just met in a bar.
"Well, we did, didn't we?"
Fuck!
"What do you want me to say, huh?"
You want me to say I love you?
Is that what you want?
Look at us.
You think we have some kind of future together... some kind of suburban bullshit?
Go.
"Well, Juliet..."
I will lie with you tonight.
"As to the means, I will not wonder long."
I do remember an apothecary who lives not far from here... if it is life... where there is neither gold... nor food... nor rest.
"Hey, there!"
Apothecary!
Who calls so loud?
Come over here.
I see that you're poor.
There is no crime in that.
"Nor pleasure, neither."
"Now, listen, I seek a kind of poison so powerful that swallowed in one dram, it stops a man and drops him in his tracks before he may but mark the consequence."
"If this be murder, the answer's no."
The victim's one I have right to kill.
I have such mortal drugs.
But Mantua's law brings death to any man who issues them.
"Are you so thin and full of wretchedness, yet scared to die?"
Famine is in your cheeks.
The world is not your friend.
"You will not find that cherishing the law makes you rich, be not poor, and break the law for this."
"My poverty, not my will, consents."
I pay your poverty and not your will.
I'm looking for Lord Romeo.
He is gone.
Gone?
And in great haste.
Back to Verona.
What purpose had you with him?
Nothing now.
You've had a wasted journey.
Who can say?
I don't want such a husband.
Whose hands are bloodied.
I don't want such a love.
Whose basis is on someone else's shoulder.
This bloodied war had orphaned me when I was young.
"If it is in my destiny to part away from you,"
"Then, I accept that."
"""Holding on to the dreams, we shall walk ahead""."
"""If ever you are lost, I shall find you out""."
"""To be lost and found, and lost again""."
"""To laugh and cry, in love""."
"""Let the victory be of both of us and the loss be only mine""."
"""Let the victory belong to you and I loose""."
I could have crushed you under the vehicle.
- Not scared?
- Scared for what?
Scared of losing what?
Everything has been lost now.
You think I have won.
"But for the first time in life, I lost even after winning."
Sheen shall marry me.
Her body shall be with me.
But her heart will remain with you.
"Till now, I have got what I wanted, completely."
"Sheen became mine, but only half."
And I don't accept half victory.
Shadab!
"Even if you were to bury me... alive, yet the flowers on my grave would be of Sheen's name."
"""In this game of love, in this union of two hearts""."
"""Let the victory be of both of us and the loss be only mine""."
"""A palm of yours and the other be mine""."
"""A palm of yours and the other be mine""."
He already told you he doesn't know anything.
No.
You're the one that said that.
He hasn't asked a damn question.
"Look, I know it doesn't look good, but there's not a law against having a dead snitch in your trunk."
So that's why you killed him?
Because he was a snitch?
"Yeah, that's it."
Yeah.
"Yeah, I killed him, I threw him in my trunk, and then I called you guys."
God damn.
"Be real, man."
"Look, he has an alibi."
All right?
All you have to do is call Donald Cooperman.
That's it.
"We called, and his assistant says he doesn't want to get involved."
"Great, but you still have the photos that show that he was serving Cooperman a subpoena at the exact time that this guy was getting stabbed and put in my client's trunk."
- This guy.
- That's right.
What time was that?
Uh--
You said you knew the exact time.
- Did I?
- We don't know the exact time that this guy was stabbed.
Cool.
Neither do I.
But I would like to know why are there people sticking dead bodies in your client's trunk.
"To frame him, obviously."
We have motive.
Karl Stoltz was investigating two of your clients on a drug deal.
You want me to give you some more motive?
Now I'm turned on by a sale at Target.
"If I could just get a guy to touch me at Target, I'd be gold."
So have sex.
I can't.
It's complicated.
"You know, I'd have to find a boyfriend who likes kids, and then I'd have to make sure that Ritchie likes him, and what if he has kids?"
"I mean, whose house do we stay over at?"
"You don't need to have a boyfriend to have sex, Peggy Sue."
Have a one-night stand.
Get one under you belt.
Do you know that you are the second person to use that expression.
Ever?
"No, not ever."
"God, a one-night stand."
I wouldn't even know where to begin.
"I mean, where would I go, what would I do, go to a singles bar?"
You could.
But that would mean hopping in a time machine and going back to when singles bars existed.
"Well, I mean, where do you go?"
I get most of my action at the grocery store.
Really?
God. 'Cause I go to the Ralph's on Pico and it's all skateboarders and lesbians.
That Ralph's is dead.
Try the Whole Foods on Fairfax.
I can't remember the last time I left that place alone.
"I have to say, I feel really uncomfortable about this."
"Well, I need company."
It would seem too whorey if I came to a grocery store to pick up a guy alone.
And bringing your brother along makes it seem wholesome?
And why are you even doing this?
I just want to feel like a woman again.
"Help me be a woman again, Matthew."
"All right, he shouldn't have gone up there."
He hasn't got it in him.
You take it from me.
I want him back.
I'm afraid you're going to have to wait.
"No, you don't understand."
I need him now.
"They're asking for boats-- fishing boats, ferries, clippers, you name it."
We're going across where the army's stuck with the Germans bombing them and tanks moving in and God knows what.
They've put together a whole fleet of boats.
"And we're going over there, and we're going to bring back our boys."
It's already begun.
"They say there were nearly 30,000 of them saved yesterday, and there's going to be 30,000 more today."
I can pick up 20 men in my boat.
"A drop in the ocean, you'd say?"
But there's hundreds of boats all along the coast doing the same-- hundreds and hundreds of them.
Only I can't do it without David.
Lady rose is too much for me to handle on my own.
So you have to let him go so we can leave together.
"You let my boy out, and I promise you--"
I swear on everything I hold sacred--
I'll bring him back to you.
I won't let him run away.
We'll do this journey.
"We'll go there, we'll come back, and then you can keep him for as long as you need, as long as it takes you to realize that he's innocent-- as innocent as you or me."
[Men shouting commands]
Dunkirk.
Do you think you'll ever see him again?
Foyle:
Yes.
He'll be back.
[Horn blows]
I don't understand.
What happened ?
You just woke up one morning and decided to waste your talent ?
How do you know I have talent ?
'Cause you saw me do some leg trick?
I saw the look on your face when you did it.
"The same as I saw tonight-- goofy, happy."
"So, if you're gonna tell me something about not dancing, at least tell me something real."
"Well, what if I don't want it to be real ?"
What I want is to wake up and see my mom again;
for things to go back to the way when my life made sense.
"But that's not gonna happen, and it's all my fault."
- All of it.
- What's your fault ?
"My mom, the accident, the fact that she's dead."
She got scraped off some highway because of me... because of my stupid audition.
Because she was rushing because I made her promise to come.
"And when they called my name, I was mad at her because-- because I needed her to be there and she wasn't."
"She was dying while I was dancing, and I was mad at her."
And I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- l'm so sorry.
- Listen.
It is not your fault that she died... or that she was rushing.
She cared about you.
She just wanted to be there for you.
That's what makes it so bad.
She always wanted what was right for me.
I wanted to be the prima ballerina.
I had to be.
And I didn't care if it took all of her money and all of her spare time.
"It was my stupid audition and my stupid dream, and it killed her."
"Now then, Rhys, do they have Christmas in New Zealand?"
We do.
Yeah?
"We do, of course."
"Big Christmas, family?"
"Yes, of course."
It's like it is here.
It's...
It's very confusing in New Zealand on that side of the world because it's summer.
Yes.
"As you can imagine, it's the opposite of what's going on here."
"It's the opposite of winter, isn't it?"
Yes.
LAUGHTER
"And yet our culture is the same, so we get all the same Christmas songs and all the same sort of festive affair that you have here with the snow."
Which makes it even more confusing.
Exactly.
So we have people that spray fake snow on all the windows and it's a bit sad.
You have your own children now.
"Two, is that right?"
Do you put out a little carrot for the reindeer?
"Well, yes."
I do that as well.
"We had to move houses because our first house didn't have any chimney and so the younger son Finn who was four at the time said, ""Santa can't get here."""
So we had to shift.
"He's one of these kids that says, ""There's no logical way Santa could get in here"
"""and I'm going to miss out."""
"We said, ""He comes through the door of houses that don't have chimneys."" ""No, he doesn't."""
So we had to actually shift which was a shame because we had a great house.
"Now we've got a much smaller house, but it's got a massive chimney."
"He gets loads of presents, so he's happy."
"What people may not know about you, I was amazed to find out, is that you were in the New Zealand Army."
That's enough from you.
Come here with me instead.
With you?
All right.
They can no longer speak!
We have to help them.
You're the only one who can help them.
I will save you.
I will give you back peace.
You needn't be afraid of us.
The ludicrous costume helps keep the villagers away from the ruins.
"As for me, I'm the keeper of this tomb."
Try to tell me how I can assist you.
Revenge.
You are free to take your revenge
The one supposed to be in this tomb is trapped somewhere in these ruins.
"He can only be liberated by innocent hands, by victims of evil."
Tonight he will call you.
He knows you are here.
It's up to you whether or not you want to set him free.
Only he can give you the means to take revenge and find peace again.
"But he's a black angel, a demon wearing a habit."
"If you set him free, you will also release his dark forces which have been locked away for a century now."
The entity imprisoned in these ruins can be very dangerous.
Right now he's possessed.
Evil lives within him.
The one behind the door is two-faced!
"You can find peace there, or death"
It's up to you now.
You can expect him to call you tonight.
Stop fidgeting.
I know they will return.
- Hit by a tram on shore leave.
- Oh!
It must make it so much worse that it wasn't for anything.
- Poor Mr. Baker.
- It's never for anything.
Why do you think people like films?
It's because stories are structure.
"They're a shape, a purpose, a meaning."
"And when things turn bad, it's still part of a plan, you know, it's..."
There's a point to it.
Unlike life.
"You don't believe in much, do you?"
I believed this was gonna be a good picture.
How did you get to do this?
"Writing, I mean."
Parfitt.
He was making comedies for Baker.
"I used to collect gags I heard in the street and sell them to him in the pub, penny a time."
Phyl thinks that you were born in the pub.
I certainly spent enough time in them as a kid.
"He was a soldier, my dad, in the last one."
"The thing about men who get sent away to war, Mrs. Cole, is that some of them don't come back at all, some come back as heroes... and some of them come back drunk, squalid bullies."
I was better off out of his way.
- In the pub.
- Or the pictures.
I liked the pictures best.
"Once in a while you just need to make one that's worth it, worth the hour and a half of someone's life it's gonna cost them to see it."
I really thought this one would be.
The bloody Yanks.
It would be all right if all you had to do was look at him.
We strip Lundbeck's dialogue down to essentials and use a voiceover.
"""I wasn't there at the beginning of the story, but it all began in a little fishing village in England."""
In every way
It's getting better and better

Hi!
Keep practicing.
I missed you.
Changed your hair.
It's pretty.
Let me walk you to the lecture hall.
That's okay.
Hey...
Took three months just to grab your hand.
Feels good!
Looking for Ji-hwan?
Yes.
I don't see him anywhere.
Hasn't come to practice.
Doesn't answer the phone either.
Hmm...
Do it for love of movies.
"Hi, how are you?"
"Good, how are you?"
"Excuse me, but..."
Can you hand me the tissues?
Damn!
Stop!
I'll kill you!

I see her often
"Mom, I'm fine Don't worry"
Leaving you alone like that
Sure you're okay?
"I'm so sorry, Yu-ri"

Okay
Take good care of Mom
"Okay, talk to you soon"

Someone told me
Yes
"Practice at home, will ya?"
"She's abnormal, that girl"

What now?
Where are you going?

Hi Victoria.
Did you work here at Western illinois University or somewhere else?
Victoria:
"I worked at Iowa State University, and I worked for the plant-introduction station at Iowa State University."
Beth Seaton:
"And this was on his US Department of Agriculture grant, correct?"
Victoria:
"Yes, it was."
Beth Seaton:
"So were you working with pennycress, too?"
Or were you working with a different crop?
[Text on screen:
"Victoria, student intern]:"
I was working with a bio-soil plant called camelina.
"And I was basically taking the diomorphic differences, which is the difference in the leaf shapes, and the morphologic measurements of camelina."
Beth Seaton:
Tell me about your internship.
What would you say was the most exciting part of it for you?
Victoria:
I got to work a little outside of my major.
I'm a biology major and chemistry.
And I'm focused more on the animal aspect.
"But I got to work more with the plant aspect of it, and I really enjoyed it."
Beth Seaton:
Hi Josh.
Josh:
Hello.
Beth Seaton:
Tell me a
little bit about your internship that you had with Dr. Phippen's
USDA grant this summer.
Josh:

Didn't you prepare the table yet?

"1051 01:28:55,025 --&amp;gt; 01:28:58,547 Everything is wonderful but how can these come here?"
"1052 01:28:58,576 --&amp;gt; 01:29:01,826 Ender is humiliating your party."
"1053 01:29:03,300 --&amp;gt; 01:29:08,200 A fair needs for street's colors you know..."
"1054 01:29:20,275 --&amp;gt; 01:29:23,021 Ok mom, I will take care of it."
- Are you in bad terms with Mira?
"1055 01:29:23,100 --&amp;gt; 01:29:26,100 No!"
- Why you're not with her then?
"1056 01:29:26,756 --&amp;gt; 01:29:28,967 Don't suffocate the kid!"
"1057 01:29:30,268 --&amp;gt; 01:29:33,457 I will find the boys."
"1058 01:29:41,494 --&amp;gt; 01:29:43,825 Straighten your face now, please!"
"1059 01:29:46,029 --&amp;gt; 01:29:48,186 The night you left me and went because of this blighter 1060 01:29:48,238 --&amp;gt; 01:29:51,536 :"
I didn't go for anyone.
I left because you annoyed me.
"1061 01:29:51,600 --&amp;gt; 01:29:55,100 Don't blame the others for your mistake!"
"1062 01:29:56,264 --&amp;gt; 01:29:58,864 In fact, do you know which our problem is?"
"1063 01:29:59,727 --&amp;gt; 01:30:02,661 We encountered very early with you"
"1064 01:30:03,751 --&amp;gt; 01:30:05,910 So..."
"1065 01:30:07,312 --&amp;gt; 01:30:09,583 I mean.. 1066 01:30:10,500 --&amp;gt; 01:30:17,200 don't ever leave from my side tonight,don't allow anyone to come between us ."

"I paid his caution 765 01:02:41,200 --&amp;gt; 01:02:45,400 She will be staying with us until his mom is released."
"766 01:02:52,830 --&amp;gt; 01:02:55,106 Who's that women?"

-Thank you.
"773 01:03:52,496 --&amp;gt; 01:03:58,155 I am afraid that this talent will fall away between these four walls"
"774 01:03:59,400 --&amp;gt; 01:04:02,000 But the music in my heart will never keep silent."
"775 01:04:02,100 --&amp;gt; 01:04:05,800 Because of I knowing that , I did something without asking you 776 01:04:05,942 --&amp;gt; 01:04:11,106 I wrote a reference letter for you to the New York Conservatoire."

You are very talented.
"779 01:04:21,600 --&amp;gt; 01:04:26,600 But I don't want to be a concert pianist 780 01:04:26,700 --&amp;gt; 01:04:32,100 I just want to sing."
I want to do my own music.
"781 01:04:32,200 --&amp;gt; 01:04:34,800 Do what you want!"
"782 01:04:34,900 --&amp;gt; 01:04:38,800 Please don't set up dreams which will never come true."
"783 01:04:38,900 --&amp;gt; 01:04:41,000 It will make me unhappier after."
"784 01:04:41,100 --&amp;gt; 01:04:46,500 Are you going to be happy studying in the financial department of Asim Sekip Kaya University ?"
"785 01:04:46,700 --&amp;gt; 01:04:51,700 My agenda was programmed, you know..."
"It's impossible to fight with my mom 786 01:04:51,900 --&amp;gt; 01:04:56,200 I will study for finances at Asim Sekip Kaya University, later masters in America."
"787 01:04:56,300 --&amp;gt; 01:05:01,000 When I return, I will work in one of the companies until I get married 788 01:05:01,100 --&amp;gt; 01:05:08,600 Of course this is not a bad program but you you will be happy if you do what you like."
"789 01:05:15,428 --&amp;gt; 01:05:18,251 15 missed calls..."
"Orkun (5), dad (2), mom (5), Mert (3 790 01:05:18,251 --&amp;gt; 01:05:21,668 Ohh there is the fair!"
"791 01:05:26,500 --&amp;gt; 01:05:29,000 What happened that he took back his complaint?"
"792 01:05:29,024 --&amp;gt; 01:05:31,404 We don't know."
Then you will die
These men are loyal to Antony
"Yes, but they will follow your lead"
Antony!
Antony!
Stop him!
Move!
Get after him!
He's wonderful with the child
"I shouldn't wonder, he's a child himself"
You would do well not to disparage Antony is my presence
Are you that much in love with him?
ls your judgement that clouded?
"I am in love, Olympos, but my mind is clear"
Egypt needs him We need Antony's strength
You haven't really tested his strength Only his weaknesses
What do you mean?
"You are strong, my queen"
You have the metal to seize and heel the world
"But Antony, he wants only to seize you"
And that makes him weak
"You're wrong, Olympos"
Antony does share the vision
And he's not weak
Grattius!
What is it?
Why are you come to Alexandria?
Your Lordship
Octavius has stolen your legions in Gaul
General Cornelius?
Dead
He's deliberately flaunting me!
Which proves all this
"Look, my memory is perfect."
I can remember anything even if it was 30 years ago
And you can ask Sheheibar and Abo Doma
Who are Sheheibar and Abo Doma?
My children
You mean Sameh and Karim?
Isn't that what I said?
You said Sheheibar and Abo Doma
No I said Sameh and Karim
Are you sure you didn't say Sheheibar and Abo Doma?
Who's the one forgetting now?
"Ok Mr.Mahmoud, Thanks"
This case is closed for now
You may go
What did your dad just do?
We all know he doesn't have alzheimer's
Maybe the medication he's talking is affecting him?
"Talk, Shaker"
Didn't you say the medication would only make him unstable and confused?
"Yeah, that's the medical evidence we know"
"But with old age, maybe the medication has affected his memory"
You mean he actually got Alzheimer's?
Even if he did get Alzheimer's
That's what we wanted
Ofcourse not
"We just want to win this case, not hurt dad"
It's the same result
"You won the case, what else do we want?"
"You're right, that's the most important thing"
"If you're gonna empathise, remember prison and all that"
"Once you get the money, just cure him using it."
SPEAKER 28:
"I don't really have to worry about it that much as a guy, I feel like, so."
SPEAKER 29:
"Being a guy, I feel like it's less of a concern."
SPEAKER 23:
And I'm not scared of personally being assaulted.
SPEAKER 20:
"As a boy, I would be less likely to be sexually abused or something like that."
SPEAKER 30:
To protect myself?
I don't really feel like I'd be too much of a victim.
"I'm more focused on my girlfriend, my female friends."
SPEAKER 31:
"Yeah, I don't think there's much I actively do or at least consciously do to protect myself [INAUDlBLE]."
SPEAKER 32:
"Um, I don't really do anything."
SPEAKER 29:
I probably don't do anything on a day-to-day basis to protect myself from sexual violence.
SPEAKER 31:
Essentially nothing.
SPEAKER 33:
Nothing.
SPEAKER 34:
This video is not intended to demonstrate what women should be doing to protect themselves.
"Rather, it is intended to highlight a social reality."
100% of women experience the threat of sexual violence every day.
This is a lived reality that most men never personally experience nor are aware of.
SPEAKER 35:
"Additionally, women are often blamed for the violence committed against them."
"She should have worn a longer skirt, or she shouldn't have drunk that much are victim-blaming phrases."
Rape is never the victim's fault.
SPEAKER 34:
"Rachael: "" I don't want to !"
"I'm happy here, and I didn't say I want to do those things ! """
"Katia: "" In your society you have to obey the rules of that society """
"A person like that, will destroy us all"
"Katia: "" Yes, it will !"
"It's dangerous on society """
"Katia: "" once she puts horns on her head, and other she wear animals """
"Rachael: "" And now animals are wrong, too ? """
"Katia: "" Defend animals in an organization """

Sometimes she uses Devil symbolisms
"Mark, you say you imitate Lady Gaga, When have you done this ?"
"Mark: "" When I spread her message to everyone """
And in the looks ?
"Mark: "" On Halloween, not more than that """
What happened in Halloween ?
"Mark: "" I wore .."
"Yeah so what ? everyone wear different things ! """
"Mark: "" I wore a Gaga costume, like anyone does on this earth """
"At those parties, Girls and boys .."
All of them are ..
Lady Gaga !
"What I really love about her, is her Courage .. she does things, no one else has done before ! and that why I love her, I want to have this courage"
"I love her, she gives me this power to live !"
She pushes you to be crazy and live your life that way you want to live it

And in Halloween ?
"Nadim: "" Last year, I made a Gaga look """
When you went out in Gaga look
How did you free yourself ?
There would still be music left to write
What else could I do
I'm so inspired by you
That hasn't happened for the longest time
Once I thought my innocence was gone
Now I know that happiness goes on
That's where you found me
When you put your arms around me
I haven't been there for the longest time
"Oh, oh, oh, oh"
For the longest time
"Oh, oh, oh"
For the longest
I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall
And the greatest miracle of all
Is how I need you
And how you needed me too
That hasn't happened for the longest time
Maybe this won't last very long
But you feel so right
And I could be wrong
Maybe I've been hoping too hard
But I've gone this far
And it's more than I hoped for
Who knows how much further we'll go on
Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone
I'll take my chances
I forgot how nice romance is
I haven't been there for the longest time
I had second thoughts at the start
I said to myself
Hold on to your heart
A man who no longer believes in himself?
Stand up!
Stand up and fight!
Be a man!
You want me to be a man?
"Yes...Antony, look at me!"
Look at me!
We'll fight!
"You may tell your Queen, Rufio, that I've received her tokens of submission and am most grateful"
As to the request to spare her son
I can not answer that for the moment
Why are you still loyal to her?
Has she enchanted you as well?
I'm under orders from Caesar...
Caesar is dead!
I am Caesar now
You could be my ears in Alexandria
"Very well, then"
"Tell her that, before I can accept her offer,"
I would require some gesture of sincerity...
tell her to deliver to me... the head of Marc Antony
You may go...
Provide Octavius with what he requires and you'll find him most grateful
No
You must
"Your Majesty, in the name of lsis, please, do not forsake your country, your own child"
Not for love
It would be like stabbing my own heart
Better Antony than Egypt
Better that than your own son's life!
Take the knife
I want to share something with you
The guys haven't finished the cake.
The was 1 whole piece and and one piece already bitten
The birthday party was interesting and joyful!
INTERESTlNG AND JOYFUll!
When the guests left the pupil was alone and he started to think
First he thought:
"""Where should I look to?... yet... to all the sides: upwards and downwards, in breadth and deep down to the left and to the right, forward and backwards expands a pointless space of our arythmic efforts and claims"
"So, which side sould I look at?"
MOTHER
THANK YOU
MOTHER
THANK YOU
MOTHER.
Mother gave 1 rouble to the pupil.
"And told him to buy 3 packs of milk 16 copecks each and 1 long loaf of ""RlGA"" bread, if there will be one."
AND WHAT IF THERE WON'T BE ANY???
"Then, buy a half of any ""black"" (rye) bread, but a fresh one!"
The pupil has done everything as the mother told him.
"He has bought 2 packs of milk and a half of ""Borodinsky"" bread"
"Since the ""RlGA"" bread WASN'T THERE!!!!!"
When he came home the pupil has given the purchase to the mother and the change left from 1 rouble
But not all of it!
The mother has allowed him to keep the copper coins
The pupil took a place near the window and started to think
First he though:
"""Twelve per night!?"
"Around 100 - 120... """
Then he thougt:
"""The circle is outlined."
"And nowere to go..."""
"""But if to think properly, the is always one correct solution"""

"Mahmoud should be with you tomorrow morning at court and you're ready, right?"
Ofcourse!
Today's case will really help us and I've made a deal with the officer
"I'd love to know, where has he been for 2 weeks"
"It's just like you see it, his actions are odd"
I'm very worried for him
What's the reason for this confusion?
Let's hope he stays that way till tomorrow!
What if he doesn't get confused tomorrow at court and told him everything?
How would we solve that?
We're ready for everything Mr.Sameh
"Medical statements, the guy who got hit yesterday."
Everything!
These will really help us
As long as he's at court tomorrow
"Mr.Mahmoud, what do you have to say for what's being said about you?"

Scientists are still mystified by how we retrieve our memories.
Each one of us has about 500 trillion synapses in our brain.
"If we could access all of them, it would be like having an entire Library of Congress in your head."
So could solving the mystery of Jill Price and her memory turn us all into living libraries?
"Once again, Diane Sawyer."
"As we now know, Jill Price has a unique brain that can, in effect, relive her life day-by-day, including watching the TV shows she loved."
I tested her memory with random clips.
"This is ""All in the Family."""
Can she guess which episode from a few seconds?
You ain't ugly.
1975.
"She had her baby on the 22nd of December, 1975, and this was right before."
She's right.
"By the way, she once helped work on a retrospective for CBS."
"Like, ""Who shot JR?"""
"And I would explain what was going on, and when it happened, so it is useful in that respect."
What was the date of that episode?
"""Who Shot JR?"" was on March 21, 1980, but we found out who shot JR on November 21, 1980."
[GUNSHOT]
And I could tell you what I was doing in both of those instances.
"The final episode of ""M*A*S*H""?"
"February 28, 1983, and I could tell you what I was doing that day, and it was raining that day too."
And what about theme songs?

We brought one to try to stump her.
"And they—that is, the Middlesex County Correctional Department were forced to place her in a women's facility."
But that was a horrible situation amounting to torture.
AG:
"Your case went to the Supreme Court, how you were treated in the court?"
LH:
"Well, there's the illusion—you know, I wrote a book called illusions of Justice."
There is the illusion that we have justice in the United States.
"I made the mistake of thinking that lawyers enjoyed a First Amendment right, and I called a press conference, and I criticized the trial judge at the trial and said that the case was a legalized lynching."
"And before you know it, I was facing disbarment."
They attempted to disbar me by bringing charges against me.
And they asked me to come and explain myself.
I refused.
I sued the judge.
I sued the prosecutor.
"And I sued all of the members of the Ethics Committee, forced them to come to my office."
I took their depositions.
And the case went all the way up to the United States Supreme Court.
"United States Supreme Court said,"
"""Well, Hinds could not have understood the seriousness of the charges; otherwise, he would not have made that sort of statement."""
They sent the case back to New Jersey.
The New Jersey Supreme Court agreed and tossed it out.

I love the whole thing.

TOM BEARDEN:
Do you ever get mad about this?
DANlEL BELL:
It gets frustrating.
It definitely does.
TOM BEARDEN:
"Bell says the ranch has become a much more dangerous place, too."
Do you fear for your life out here?
DANlEL BELL:
"Yes, when we're out in places like this, where we don't have communications, and you're always thinking, what am I going to do if something happens?"
TOM BEARDEN:
Have you ever come across armed people coming across the border?
DANlEL BELL:
"Yes, I have, on several occasions."
And the most recent one was actually when we were building this fence.
"We were hauling material in with a mule and we came around on a trail that's used by smugglers, and ran right into a group of about 10 people."
I have two daughters now.
That's Ida and her baby sister Rosa.
And to the junk food industry I say this: my children - all of our children - are none of your business.

Thank you.

And so the students take full advantage of those opportunities.
The learn a lot from it also.
Beth Seaton:
"You have a lot of international type of things going on in the department also, don't you?"
William Bailey:
We certainly do.
"For many of our students, they have not had the opportunity to go overseas."
"Some of them, frankly, have not even been to Chicago or on an airplane."
But we take them and have taken them to China.
"Last year, was to Australia."
We have a trip to Brazil coming up.
"A trip to Russia, which was very successful."
"And the students understand that it opens up a whole new world for them, which they were not aware of before."
Beth Seaton:
I remember reading in the newspaper about the trip you took to Australia.
You were on that trip.
William Bailey:
Yes.
Beth Seaton:
I was surprised at how many students you were able to take with you.
William Bailey:
"It's always a concern, because the students pay for it themselves."
"We keep the cost as low as possible but at the end of the day, it is a wonderful experience, and the students uniformly get their moneys' worth."
And we have many students who will go on every trip we offer.
Beth Seaton:
Thanks for taking the time to talk with me today about some of the things going on in the School of

Now we are going to look at the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and it's role on heart health.
The Mediterranean diet has certainly been around for millennium and yet there is no one Mediterranean diet.
"It refers in general to the way the people in the countries of the Mediterranean diet, have traditionally eaten foods."
"There's a hypothesis that there are differences among these populations, for whatever reason."
The way that these populations have eaten for centuries has actually lead to lower rates of heart disease that you might see in other parts of the world.
So the first person to really study this relationship and to scientifically prove that eating a certain way impacted your heart health was an individual known as Dr. Ancel Keys.
Dr. Ancel Keys lived to be 100 years old from 1904 to 2004.
"Jack had a bucket in his hand, a chicken under his arm, and a pitch fork and a rope at the end of which there was a goat."
"And Jill said, I am feeling very nervous."
"Jack said, Why? I am afraid you may have your way with me."
I am alone with you.
"He said, What do you mean?"
I didnt do anything and my hands are full?
"So she said, You may put the pitch fork down, plant it in the earth, tie the goat to it, put the chicken down and put the bucket over it, couldnt you?"
(Laughter)
"And in the process of holding a relationship, the first moment of meeting the expectations may be common."
"But as every step that we take in life, the expectations may become different."
"Because these expectations keep changing in people, they are not consistent and they cannot be."
One person may be consistent with the same expectation throughout their life; another persons expectations may be changing because his perception and experience of life is changing.
Now relationships become great conflict.
(Applause)
A while ago an old client contacted me.
He was having some trouble at work and he was asking me for coaching
"It was in the early days of August, he was telling me he had some time issues, but I agreed,  so he sent me a message asking me,"
"""Can you make it on Tuesday  at 20 and 8 minutes?"
"The first thing I thought was,  ""At that time of the night?"""
"Plus, he was cynical, he asked for 20:08."
Couldn't it be at 8:30? or 8:00?
"Fine, I forgot about it."
"Ok, I texted him"
A week passed away.
"Next Monday  I sent him a confirmation message,"
"""Where do you want us to meet?"
"""At the office..."""
At that time in the office?
8pm?
Generally they're closed.
"Fine, Ok I tell him, ""I'll see you tomorrow."""
"Automatically he sends me a message,  ""Tomorow?"""
It spent most of its time in Algiers. ...and recently turned up and it went to Switzerland.
Now we have it.
It's a major discovery.
It's a unique piece.
"There is no other cast of it in bronze."""
The buste comes with its original wooden case which is covered with masonic symbols.
"It's on sale for 680,000 euro."
"Other gems at this year's Tefaf are paintings by El Greco, Auguste Renoir and Frans Hals."
This Rembrandt is the most expensive piece on exhibit.
The asking price is 35 million euro.
New York-based art dealer Richard Feigen says the global art market... ...remains buoyant as a result of continuing financial uncertainty.
"""There is a lot of liquidity, a lot of money out looking for art... ...and less and less art to buy with it."
"I think that reflects that art has effectively been monetized... ...and now seems to be regarded as an asset class, a place of refuge."
"People don't like the dollar, they don't like the euro, they don't like sterling."""
Security at the Tefaf art fair has been stepped up considerably this year.
"Last year, on the final day of the art fair, one visitor walked away with two pieces of jewelry... ...worth 860.000 euro."
Without paying.

Hello everyone and welcome to another edition of Inside Leathernecks
I'm your host Nick Spinozzi today we are with
WlU Men's Golf Head Coach Mel Blasi.
Mel thanks for joing us today.
[Mel Blasi]
Thanks for having me.
Coach why don't you start by telling me a little bit about yourself.
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Well I'm a..a..46 years old
I guess maybe you don't want to know that but I have a family a young family here in town a wife and 3 children.
I've been coaching here at the university for 13 years and I'm also a graduate of Western illinois 1987.
[Nick Spinozzi]
This is your 13th year coaching 12th or 13th?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
"Even better, just sweep."
You know what I mean?
(Laughter)
And I am energizing myself  while I am doing that.
"I don't know whether it is helpful, but I think finding times during your day, standing in the copy room... (Bell) (Laughter)"
Thank you brother.
(R. Brady) One bell.
That's fine sometimes.
"Sorry, I'll go a little more faster."
"So, I think there are ways to ... (Laughter) (R. Brady) Outline the summary."
"Okay, thank you."
(Laughter)
(Bell) (Laughter)
"(R. Brady) Thank you Jon, I think this brings up a question that many of us have, which is if we bring mindfulness into our classroom, will there be less time for the other things?"
(Laughter)
So the answer is no.
Katherine Weare is a professor at the Exeter University in UK.
"She has been very involved in social  emotional learning, creating curriculum, and more recently, has been involved  with the creation and evaluation of the .b (dot-be) Mindfulness Curriculum which is developed for secondary students in England by mindfulness practitioners who  are teachers in secondary schools."
"- (R. Brady) So, Katherine ..."
- (K. Weare) Thank you.
Thank you for inviting me here.
"As you get that I am from England,  so I hope you'll understand the accent."
(Laughter)
It is great to be here and looking at these great crowded people can make you feel quite jumped-up really about yourself and feel you are very important  to be sat on this stage.
I went home once after a do like this and I said to my son- he was in the kitchen-
"""I had a great time."
"Somebody came up to me afterwards and said, 'I could listen  to you talk all day'."""
"He said, ""Only because we don't have to."""
(Laughter)
"But I am afraid you have to, for 7 and half minutes, whatever I have left."
"Like everyone here, I have a mindfulness story and it is very similar actually, to some of the earlier ones."
"I was sailing along as a very successful, in inverted commas, academic."
Because that's where I am going to be

I'm sure you're feeling uncomfortable
"Sir, with all due respect, sitting on a red hot poker is uncomfortable."
This is excruciating.
Maybe we should just put it on the## backburner for a while
I was kinda hoping you could explain that picture.
"Well, I was asking for change."
How was I supposed to know he was a prostitute
"So, what does### she look like to you"
She reminds me of that woman Stuart brought to the governor balls
"Thankk goodness, we can explain this whole situation"
I think I can handle it without bring my mother into it.
I was wanting to save subjecting her sex life to the scrutiny of the new York press for her Christmas visit.**
"Oh, she's coming for Christmas?"
"Sir, if you don't mind."
My mother is in there. i was kinda hoping we'd### have a little mother-son bonding
Can I at least say hi?
I think you have your quality time
"Honey, I'm so unbelievably sorry"
Just a minute
Still bonding sir
Good morning

Mr.Sameh
"The people were asking, do we stay or do we leave?"
Their presence now isn't really important I guess...
Pay them and let them leave
What?
Nobody is gonna leave
Assume he suddenly returns
He has to return to find everything the way it was
Yeah I agree
"If he returns, treat him just like you did at first"
Got it?
Okay
"Let's go, looks like we wont find anything here"
"It's no use, we've been looking for 2 weeks"
Now what?
We're doing what we can
All this is useless
The court meeting is tomorrow
And now what?
"It's a difficult situation, if the father isn't here, we'll lose the case"
We'll be jailed for at least 5 years
"No, we can't wait that long"
"Karim, Sameh, you have to decide on something"
Can't we get another guy to pretend he's dad?
"This situation has other arrangements, we have no time"
And we can't postpone tomorrow's court session?
That was the final postponal
Can't you lend us money till we find dad?
"If I had money, do you think I would've been helping you now?"
"Listen, when it comes to the bank we all took that loan"
Which means we'd all go to prison
"Don't say that, hopefully nothing bad will happen"
"Ok, well, the moment we've all been waiting for.. this is what I'm getting Judy for May Day, these cool underwear things."
I'ts a new style for panties.
They were my mom's when she was little.
So I'm pretty sure Judy'll be really happy to wear my mom's used underwear.
Here I go.
"Judy, happy May Day; here's your new panties."
"Judy:Ew, get away!"
"Fred:How could you say that, Judy?!"
"Oh, my God!"
I'm so embarassed!
"Oh, my God, this is so embarassing!"
This is so embarassing!
I didn't get it on video tape but Judy put the panties on my head.
She's so mean!
Yet so attractive.
"Whatever, I guess I'll give them back to my mom."
I'm going inside my house and never coming back out.
Nobody understands me.
(singing) My May Day didn't turn out
How I wanted it to
Everything went wro-o-o-o-o-ong
I hope next year is better
I can't believe Judy threw panties on me (high-pitched note)
"Fred:Okay, well, that's all I have for you guys."
"I hope all you guys' May Day was better than mine, okay?"
"No need to rub in how good your May Day was compared to mine, no offense."
"Okay, well, see y'all."
(high-pitched note plays again)
The early detection of the risk of suffering from depression during or after pregnancy may reduce the negative effects in both the mother and the foetus.
"Researchers from the Universitat Jaume I in Castelló and from the Universidad de Zaragoza have developed the computer application 'Mamá Feliz' [Happy Mum], which enables to anticipate depression."
-The main objective of our project 'Mamá Feliz' is studying the risk factors which the scientific literature has proven to be related to the greater probability of developing depression during the pregnancy or after birth.
"Therefore, we have created a computer application, 'Mamá Feliz', which includes these variables."

The murderer is caught.
He confessed everything.
Read it and maybe you'll realize how unfairly you treated me.
Ferhat killed the man's son.
And he waited for the right time to get revenge.
Unfortunately there are no such churches in Taiwan.
And then Bee went to Hamburg.
To the musical.
"When we planned our journey to Somalia, the media reported about a humanitarian catastrophe."
Back then 20 000 people starved to death.
Half a million Somalis fled to Kenia from the draught.
And I saw a photo in a newspaper report.
"There is a small child on the ground in a bent position, about 4 years old, naked."
"Next to it, there is a vulture, waiting for the child to die."
The photographer waited 20 minutes for the vulture to spread its wings.
I would like to stage a play in the National Theatre of Somalia.
It should be like this.
"So good, that the whole audience would be so enthusiastic, that suddenly there would be peace in the whole country."
Then I made one more attempt.
On the rehearsal stage I focused all the lightning on one place.
I lay down there.
"I wanted to see, how long it takes that I get really thursty, and how long I could endure it."
I made a performance as well.
I wanted to feel the earthquake of tsunami 2005 in my body.
I fell to the floor.
I slipped over the stage with tap-dance-shoes.
There were ugly scratches on the stage and it sounded ugly.
And then much more text.
Bee is still in Hamburg at the musical.
I went to drink some water first and turned on the radio.
In the National Theatre in Mogadishu a suicide-bomber blew herself up at an anniversary.
"Mogadishu doesn't need beautiful arts, but hard life."

The city swings and 200 dancers from 20 nations are swinging with it.
At the first Jazz festival in Heidelberg [Germany] over the weekend.
This is the first dance of my life;  I used to boycott the dance school
It is extremely multisided as you can be extremely creative and playful.
Because it is fun and you meet people; for example somebody like this.
There are nearly no rules.
You can't make mistakes.
Everything is  just a variation.
You can do what you want.
It is really the best dance that I know.
"Katja and Ali are dance partners, but also married couple."
They teach Lindy Hop all over Europe.
With the first Jazz festival here in Heidelberg they both realised themselves a dream.
"Swing is for the vice european vice champions not only a music and dance, but also an attitude towards life and limitless."
"It is like a language; first you learn the grammar in class and then everybody can ""speak"" with each other on the dance floor."
"New York, 1927:"
"Black and White, poor and rich,  meet on the dance floor in Harlem."
"At the Savoy ballroom the Lindy Hop is created, the most original way of swing dancing."
There are no written rules.
Lindy Hop thrives on improvisation.....
...to this day!
"That makes it so exciting, fun, sexy, full of energy!"
"The atmosphere is boiling in Heidelberg's town hall when the Shim Sham song comes on, one of the highlights of the evening."
But what would Swing and the 20s be without Big Band and dresscode.
"Part of it is a proper hair-do, the adequate outfit."
"It also makes you dance differently, compared to dancing in jeans and T-shirt."
"Katja and Ali met in Paris, dancing on the banks of the Seine."
And their enthusiasm is as fresh as on the first day.
"Okay as usual, are there any questions or comments about the talk this evening on emotions?"
"Yeah, okay."
Man 1: ...[difficult to hear]
"(if we point one finger at someone, three point back at us)..."
Ajahn Brahm:
"Yeah, you're talking about that one."
That's the old story.
"See three, you don't know what the thumb is doing, but one's pointed that way."
Man 1:
[difficult to hear]
Ajahn Brahm:
"Yes that's right, so if you criticise somebody else.."
This was actually a saying of the Emperor Ashoka.
"Who was a Buddhist, was it it 200 years before the birth of...about 22 hundred years ago or something."
"And he wrote in stone, we know what he said because those stone monuments are still there."
"Usually in museums now, some are in their original place."
He said this wonderful thing that anybody who criticises another person's religion thereby criticises his own faith.
"That's a wonderful thing to say 22 hundred years ago, what a beautiful way of tolerance."
"You criticise somebody else's religion, then you're showing that your own faith is not really up to scratch."
It's not just religion - if you criticise somebody else then you're showing your own understanding of life is lacking.
How can you criticise others?
"How much do you know about them, why they did that?"
How many times have you been criticised - unfairly?
So why do you go criticising others?
Give them the benefit of the doubt.
And you have a happy life.
And there's much doubt to give people the benefit of.. [laughter]
Okay thank you for that Eddy.
"We've got a question there, and then over there, yes"
Man 2 [hard to hear]:
"Your Holiness, I was intrigued by your labelling of grief as a negative emotion."
The way I see it negative emotions are destructive.
Now where was she living and where were you living at the time?
Sal:
"She was based in New Orleans,which is where I grew up."
But I was in Boston at the time.
"And we agreed that she would go home, and we would get on a conference cal,l and we'd figure out something."
I used Yahoo Doodle to tutor her.
"And a couple months later, that worked out."
"Then I started tutoring her brothers, a couple other cousins."
"The whole time, I still had a day job."
"And about a year later, it just became hard for me to scale myself:"
I had trouble scheduling with all my different cousins and family friends and all the rest
And I had a buddy who I was talking to over dinner.
And I said:
"""You know, I'm really enjoying this tutoring thing that I'm doing after work."
"But it is getting difficult."""
"And he said ,""Why don't you just record your lectures and put them on YouTube?"""
"And I said; ""No, YouTube is for dogs on skateboards."
"It's not for serious mathematics, """
"But I tried it out, and, long story short:"
My cousins said that they liked me better on YouTube than in person.
"And other people did too, and they just kept watching it."
"So, it's about 2.5 million people a month are watching the videos."
Tom:
And you've got about 2200 videos.
Sal:
"It is now pushing 2800 videos, on everything from basic addition to vector calculus, and biology, and chemistry, and whatever else."
Tom:
Is this a commercial enterprise?
Are you doing this just to keep the country better informed?
Sal:
No.. a lot of my buddies from the very for-profit investment world are wondering what happened to Sal.
But I decided to make it a not-for-profit.
But this is the only rivet that we found between this lentoid and the previous lentoid that was cleaned.
And you can see that the rivet is resting on top of a small silver divider and that's something that is a feature that is also present on the previous lentoid.
And I am right in thinking - you were telling me at the other side you can actually see the holes where these pins may have been?
You can.
So if I pan over the central gold foil...
You can see that there are two large rivet holes present on this side as well.
And one small rivet hole sort of tucked in the corner
looks like maybe they made a mistake!
So what are we looking at here Ellen?
You can see here the clean garnets and some of them are quite lovely and you can still see the inter play of light with the backing foils showing through.
And I'm presently working on writing up a little blog for the website about this treatment so that you can see the before and after of images.
hey guys how are y'all doing
"I was hanging out with a friend yesterday and he said something that ""REALLY"" hurt me!"

My friend:
No
Me:
"Just go, don't be scared My friend:"
Noooooo
Me:
Why not?

"If I ask you, apart from Violin do you know what other instrument can be played on the shoulder?"
That's Right!
Is a VlOLA~
If you have no idea what a viola is it actually doesn't matter....
"Since, most of the violists are used to it and not only viola but many other instruments or  music genres are being misunderstood or neglected."
That's why I am here making a mini series  about music knowledges that you may not know.
[ The E Symphony ]
The 1st episode of the E Symphony will be about the viola
The English name of the viola is viola.
(nice translation)
"Some people pronounce as ""viola"""
Viola with other string instruments are all evolved  from a Baroque instrument called the Viol
"You may have now notice that, compare to the violin, cello or double bass, you have less opportunity to hear the word ""viola"""
"But this is pretty normal, this already happened since long time ago"
The structure of early music is
The top part (treble) makes the melody.
The lowest part (bass) makes the basic harmony
"And so, that's the exciting thing about pennycress."
It's a brand new crop.
"No one has actually done much research on this particular crop, and so the possibilities are endless on pennycress."
And it's exciting to have students involved in this type of project.
And the employment opportunities are tremendous.
You're starting to see a lot companies starting to talk about green energy and green production.
"And so these students are going to be positioned very well, in terms of getting positions at these companies,"
"looking at new crops, and breeding new varieties, and things like that."
Beth Seaton:
"It's really exciting that we have these opportunities for students here in Macomb, illinois."
And I really appreciate you showing me your lab and talking to me about your project.
Win Phippen:
That's great.
Anytime.
"You know what, later on this week, we're actually having a Field Day about pennycress."
"It will be out at the research farm, and it's opportunity for not only producers, but also, say, for potential students and other students to come out and see what we're doing out in the field."
Beth Seaton:
"Okay, great!"
I would love to come out if you would be willing to show it to me.
Win Phippen:
I'd love to.
Make sure to bring your boots!
Beth Seaton:
"Okay, thanks."
Win Phippen:
It should be fun.
Win Phippen:
All right.
Thanks for coming out.
This is the field plots for the pennycress research.
We've got several studies out here.
"The one to the north here is a planting density and planting methods study, where we are trying to answer the question of how many seeds do we need to put in the ground to get a decent yield."
Okay.
So what have we got on this
left-hand side?
A linear combination.
"It's a linear combination now of three vectors,"
and they happen to be -- each one is a three dimensional
"vector, so we want to know what combination"
of those three vectors produces that one.
Shall I try to draw the column
"picture, then?"
"So, since these vectors have three"
components -- so it's some multiple -- let me draw in the first
column as before -- x is two and y is minus one.
Maybe there is the first column. y -- the second column has maybe a
"minus one and a two and the y is a minus three, somewhere,"
"there possibly, column two."
And the third column has --
"no zero minus one four, so how shall I draw that?"
So this was the first component.
The second component was a minus
one.
Maybe up here.
"That's column three,"
that's the column zero minus one and four.
This guy.
"So, again, what's my problem?"
What this equation is asking me to do is to combine these three vectors
with a right combination to produce this one.
"Well,"
"you can see what the right combination is, because in"
"this special problem, specially chosen by the lecturer,"
that right-hand side that I'm trying to get is actually one of these
(Laughter)
Anyway --
"When our dino-chicken hatches, it will be, obviously, the poster child, or what you might call a poster chick, for technology, entertainment and design."

"Hello and welcome to Freshly Served, the healthy vegan cooking show."
Iím Heather and tonight we are going to make some maple Dijon glazed carrots and parsnips.
This is something that I love to make as part of appetizers night.
Phil and I sometimes
like we were having a celebration to just do a whole dinner of appetizers but it is also be a nice side for other dish or whatever you like.
"So for those of you who have not seen parsnips before they look like a white carrot, they usually have a very fat end as suppose to carrots which are usually fairly uniform just getting skinnier at the tip."
So you wanna have the same amount of parsnips as carrots.
"It doesnít really matter how much youíre doing but anyway with carrots I donít peel them, I just trim off either end and give them a good scrub with a potato scrubber brush."
"Odysseus sends back the message, not yet."
Let's wait until nighttime.
Very interesting exchange of messages there.
"They're, they're easy enough to take on the plain surface level and may well be that all that's happened is Penelope has said, yeah, sure I'd like to talk to this stranger."
I could find out about my husband.
"And this stranger says, well let's do it later on."
It's more convenient for me.
"But, there's something also, the, the, the forwardness of Penelope may, asking to make an audience with this stranger whose nothing but a beggar."
"And then the stranger coming back and saying, rather than just sort of dropping everything and saying, oh my gosh the lady of the house is willing to speak with me."
"But rather, saying, hold off, wait."
"Let's do it at nighttime, when we can do it in a different kind of setting."
"Both those things I think are, it's possible that there's a subterranean back message being sent in the message."
"So, kind of like, metadata built into the message that's being sent that says ""I want to pay some attention to you"" on both sides."
We'll see what that attention's going to be in the coming books.
"So, things start to unfold rapidly and quickly in seventeen through twenty."
"Lots of the good stuff starts to, unpack itself here."

She was that powerful.
One day she had a question for the class.
I'm sitting there.
Let's go back to the 1970's.

Tom Brokay:
Who says that CBS has got a corner on the Amazing Race?
We've got our own going on here on Education Nation.
"I'm joined now by Sal Khan, who, in a fact, is one of the leading innovators of the country, but kind of stumbled into it,"
You were a computer science enthusiast.
Sal:
Yes.
Tom:
You got into the venture capital business.
But you had a niece across the country who was having some difficulties doing her math.
What happened then?
Sal:
"Yes, it was 2004, they were visiting me right after my wedding."
It just turned out.. it came out while we were just talking about it that she was getting tracked into a slower math class when she was going into 7th grade right after the summer.
And I talked to her.
"I said ""Nadia, you are clearly a bright girl --"
And we share a certain amount of DNA --
"There is no way that you should be tracked into a slower math class."""
"And so, she agreed that we would tutor each other, or I would tutor her when she went back."
Tom:
Khan's lessons are unscripted and unadorned.
His voice over a black screen as he writes or doodles!
His style has changed little since this all began back in 2004 as
Youtube videos to help his young cousins.
9 times the 6...!
"He's now recorded more than 2,400 lessons on everything from simple arithmetic to college-level biology."
Anyone can watch for free!
People are more likely to say thank you when it's free!
And thank you is worth a lot!
But what are Khan's lessons worth?
The Los Altos school district is trying to figure that out.
"Last year, the district used Khan lessons in five classes."
"The students did well enough that this year, the Khan method is in 40 classes to be used by every fifth and sixth grader in the district!"
We found that the students are really engaged in this type of learning.
It was a great addition to what we were already doing.
You might say this California school has flipped!
"Students get their lectures at home and come to school to do their homework, fundamentally changing the role of the teacher!"
The kids can really move through in their own pace.
And then I can see who is struggling.
"At home, students listen to Khan's online lessons."
"In the classroom, they practice what they learn while teacher Courtney Cadwell works with those who need help."
"When they're having fun and they're wanting to do math, that tells me that this is a good thing."
This educational overall comes from a man who was working as a hedge fund analyst until 2009!
Khan has a Harvard MBA and three degrees from MlT.
"You're kind of a math geek, I guess."
Aren't you?
"Yes, in the best form of the word!"
"In the beginning, he financed the Khan Academy from his own savings, until he was discovered by some people with money."
"Well, it's amazing!"
I think you just got a glimpse of the future of education.
Thank you!

"So, what do you get and if you get a lot of money basically, you get two million dollars, 2.59 million dollars, arlight."
"Its two, five, nine, zero, five, six, five."
"So, what does this tell you?"
"This tells you that if you invest $10,000 in a bank 40 times, the future value of that will end up being 2.59 million dollars."
"So, what"
"I'm going to do, I'm going to try to talk you through the problem again."
"So, just, so that we are working together."
What did I do?
I calculated Future Value.
"So, in order to calculate Future Value of something that I don't know, I have to use the Future Value function in the calculator or in the spreadsheet."
"And out popped, I gave this information $10,000 was the PMT, 40 was n."
But most importantly eight percent was r.
"So, I gave all this information to Excel or a calculator, whatever you choose to be using, simply because it's a very complicated calculation."
"Conceptually, it's not that difficult."
And we got 2.59 mil.
"And I'm going to just use it approximately because I'm not going to calculate, write all the digits and so on."
"So, what has happened here?"
Let me just walk you through this problem.
"First of all, remember yesterday, remember I asked you, what is the answer to a Finance question or anybody asks you what, what should you say?"
Compounding.
But you always have to pause because you want to
"look smart, right?"
"So, you take a pause, and you say compounding."
"And so, so let me ask you the following question."
"Suppose there was no interest rate or, in other words, how much of the 10,000 are you throwing in?"
And suppose the interest is zero.
This problem is very simple to do.
Why?
"Because you do 40 times 10,000."
"You have $400,000, right."
"So, the interest rate, time value of money is zero, you will have a lot of money in your bank account but how much will it be?"
"400,000."
I have the dream that one  day everyone will be able... ...to walk around safely without  worrying about being bullied.
When we think about bullying... ...we typically think about one child bullying another on the playground.
But bullying is far more pervasive.
"People get bullied in  school, their workplace... ...on Facebook and  sometimes even at home."
"People get bullied because  of the clothes they wear... car they drive, music they  listen to or their profession."
The question that comes to my  mind when I think of bullying is... ...What does it achieve?
Does bullying bring inner-happiness?
Does it result in lasting power?
Does it really build self-confidence?
"On the contrary, it is simply a reflection of the bully's own lack of self-worth, ...dissatisfaction and fear."
There are many ways that we can address bullying.
Supporting others is a great preventative strategy.
"If EVERYONE were supported, it would help others be strong and proud of who... ...they are so that THEY  can pursue their dreams."
I dream of a world where EVERYONE can get the support they need to thrive.
Where they are NOT put down by others.
Where they can proud be of who they are and proud of who they want to be.
[applause]
Thank you.
[applause]
Thank you.
"Becuase of bullying, many great ideas have been lost."
"People have become depressed, inflicted pain on themselves... ...committed suicide, or turned  their hurt and anger on others."
They have been permanently scarred and... ...hurt because of the  words and actions of others.
"They question their existence, their self-worth."
All because of bullying.
I have a dream that one day all of this will be gone.
No more ideas lost.
No more hurt feelings.
No more suicides.
"No more ""let bullying be gone forever."""
[applause]
We can do it if we start taking  the issue of bullying a priority.
We're imaging that we're going be able to create a function T that is going to give us the answer to that.
Let's just leave it at that for now.
"Finally, in the case where a is odd, it's going to execute the condition of this if statement, the condition of this if statement, both of which will fail."
"Then it will recursively compute the product, and then basically execute the returns."
A total of 3 statements plus however long it takes to do the recursive call-- so 3 statements plus this particular kind of recursive call.
This now is a mathematical specification of a function.
"We don't know at the moment what the relationship is between a and T(a), but at least it's fully specified."
"It turns out that you actually can solve this pretty easily by using what we already worked out about the number of times you can divide a number a in half, rounding down if it's odd, before you get down to 0."
See if you can put that together to try to answer the question what does T(a) equal from these set of choices.

Aish!
What happened yesterday?
Cell phone!
I am really disappointed!
Why on earth did you go to a place like that?
Leaving all the nice places aside?
"Ah, I don't know, I don't know."

Now that's what I'm talking about!
Let's bring it in.
"You know, Brandon, Rollercoaster Day's not just about the thrill of g-forces and riding coasters with your friends, it's a lot more than that."
"It's about taking a day off work, taking a day off of school, and just going and having fun."
We don't have to go and fulfill our commitments.
We can take a day off and just ride rollercoasters together.
"Rollercoaster day this year falls on Wednesday, April 27th."
That means you're gonna have to ditch class and call in sick for work.
"Rollercoaster Day is an international event, so here's what you're gonna have to do."
"If you're in the Los Angeles area, over here,"
Join as at Six Flags Magic Mountain!
"If you live over here, find a theme park near you and go there."
"If you live over here, your theme parks might not be open yet so you gotta do some other fun activity"
"like snowboarding or ice skating or something, I dunno."
"If you're in the rest of the world, I'm gonna be honest -"
I have no idea what your weather / theme park situation is but the point is that you have to abandon your commitments and have a day of fun wherever you are.
All of these details will be up at http://facerocker.com/rcday2011.

"The best excuse, of course, is to retroactively show your teacher or boss this video."
That's probably -

"At 877 pounds, he is CRlMINALLY light for his size."
"Take a look at a real blue whale, which can grow to be up to twice as long as a Wailord."
"They weigh around 150-170 metric tons. or something around 350,000 pounds."
The difference in weight is so astronomical that it's absurd!
"In fact, at that weight and that height, if you estimate Wailord's volume with around a 20 by 48 foot cylinder,"
Wailord is actually less dense than air.
"Like, he'd float! in the Air!"
Like a Blimp! and that's when you realize
Wailord's the- the what?
The FLOAT whale pokémon.
AUGHHHHHHHHHHHH!
The official pokédex is a strange one and it usually crushes my dreams every time I learn about a pokémon's true size.
I might not ever be able to ride a Charizard but it's okay bec-. . .(begins sobbing) who am I kidding?
T n T (sniffles) This isn't okay at all!
I hate my life!
Thanks for watching today's video.
I encourage you: find your favorite pokémon in the pokédex and find out exactly how long they are and what they're weight is.
"I guarantee, 9 times out of 10 you'll be surprised."
Let me know in the comments section below if one of your favorite pokémon was a size you NEVER would have expected.

He became a recluse.
"Dodged by death, he spent much of his time in his suite at the Waldorf-Astoria."

"We're logged in as Gordon, Vice President of Sales."
Let's see how well he's doing in reaching revenue goals for the current period.
"We want to see the four-quarter period for 2013, so let's change our view."
We'll display forecasts for all four quarters of the 2013 fiscal year Now we'll click the plus symbol to expand the current quarter to see what we have.
(You'll only need to expand a period if you're a forecast manager.).
You can see the individual amounts you have in each forecast category.
You can see opportunities that make up the totals in each category in the bottom pane of the screen.
So then we're in trouble.
If the three columns of my matrix -- if those three vectors happen to lie
"in the same plane -- for example, if column three is just the sum of"
"column one and column two, I would be in trouble."
That would
"be a matrix A where the answer would be no, because the combinations --"
"if column three is in the same plane as column one and two,"
I don't get anything new from that.
All the combinations are in the
plane and only right-hand sides b that I could get would be the ones
in that plane.
So I could solve it for some
"right-hand sides, when b is in the plane,"
but most right-hand sides would be out of the plane and unreachable.
So that would be a singular case.
The matrix would be not invertible.
There would not be a solution for every b.
The answer would become no
for that.
Okay.
I don't know -- shall we take just
a little shot at thinking about nine dimensions?
Imagine that we have
vectors with nine components.
"Well, it's going to be hard to"
visualize those.
I don't pretend to do it.
"But somehow, pretend you do."
Pretend we have -- if this was nine
"equations and nine unknowns, then we would have nine columns,"
and each one would be a vector in nine-dimensional space and we would
be looking at their linear combinations.
"I'm Moopheus, and I know a lot about you."
Have you heard of the Meatrix?
The Meatrix?
Do you want to know what it is?
OK.
"The Meatrix is all around you, Leo."
It is the story we tell ourselves about where meat and animal products come from.
This family farm is a fantasy.
"Take the blue pill and stay here in the fantasy, take the red pill and I will show you the truth."
Welcome to the real world.
Whoah!
What is this horrible place?
"This is a factory farm, Leo."
"Places like this are where most eggs, milk and meat come from."
How did this happen?
I'll show you.
"In the mid 20th century, greedy agriculture corporations began modifying sustainable family farming to maximize their profits at great cost to both humans and animals."
Factory farming was born.
Animals are packed as closely together as possible.
"Most never see sunlight, touch ground or get fresh air."
Many can't even turn around.
These cruel conditions cause fights and disease amongst the animals.
"To fix this, the corporate machine began systematic mutilation, practices such as de-beaking chickens."
"And they started adding a constant dosage of antibiotics to their feed, just to keep these poor wretches alive."
This overuse of antibiotics breed super strains of resistant disease-causing germs.
Every day we get closer to an epidemic that cannot be stopped.
Eeeuw!
What's that smell?
12 million pounds of excrement!
This pollutes the air and ground water.
That's why communities near factory farms often suffer from high levels of related sicknesses.
"Well, it smells like shhhhh ..."
"Well, now that you do know, would you think it's possible... ...that Emily, in her psychotic state... ...might have activated both sets of vocal cords... ...so as to achieve the amazing effect we heard captured on your audiotape?"
Her state was not psychotic.
"Father Moore, you told us that in the exorcism we heard... ...you actually saw, once again, this black-robed figure... ...or demonic apparition, am I right?"
- Yes.
"But we couldn't see him when you played the tape, correct?"
"- No, of course not."
- Of course not.
"So that would be another supernatural aspect of the exorcism... ...your tape doesn't prove, correct?"
- Yes.
"Where is your dark figure, Father?"
Is he here now?
Do I look like your demon ghost?
- Your Honor.
- Counselor.
I have nothing further.
Does the defense wish to redirect?
"No, Your Honor, but we reserve the right to recall the witness later."
Very well.
The witness may step down.
"Your Honor, my next witness must have been detained."
If we could take a short recess so I could...
"You've made this court wait before, counselor."
I'm inclined to...
"Your Honor, please."
Dr. Cartwright came to us in good conscience... ...as an eyewitness to the exorcism on Father Moore's tape.
He can substantiate all of my client's testimony...
"Your Honor, the defense has already presented its exorcism testimony... ...in dramatic fashion."
Do we really have to..?
We have absorbed some extraordinary testimony today.
I think we'll take some time to consider it.
Court is adjourned until 9:30 tomorrow morning.

Here are all the Tweets from everyone that I follow.
It looks like my friend Maggie just posted a Tweet about the Cove.
Let me see what else she's talking about.
Oh wow!
It looks like she just posted a reply to my friend Ed.
I didn't know he was on Twitter!
I think i'll go ahead and follow him.
I'm going to check out who else she's following 'cause there might be some interesting people in there.
It doesn't appear that I know most of these people.

"But with Jill, she's right there."
"For instance, her mother, a dancer, remembers saying the usual one or two things about her daughter's weight gain."
Jill has the days and dates.
She'll not realize that she said 500 times.
She'll think she's said it one time.
"And it has caused a weight problem for her, but there's nothing I could do about it anymore."
"Jill wants us to know that too much memory, living in the past, is paralyzing."
It's uncontrollable.
"I actually probably should be in a mental hospital because this makes me crazy, but I figured out a way to live with this."
Think about your junior year in high school.
Now what can you remember?
Doctor Cahill and Doctor McGaugh of the University of California
Irvine say there's something else they've
"learned about that mysterious part of Jill's brain, which is larger than usual."
It's an area associated with OCD.
We believe that she has strong tendencies towards obsessive-compulsive.
"Could her brain be storing an infinity of memories, just as some OCD patients hoard things?"
We don't think it is an accident that the tendency to collect is both for objects and for memories.
"We think these are related, and we think the brain does it, and we want to figure out how."
"Do you save things, hoard things?"
"I don't like the word hoard, but yeah."
I have the first doll that was put in my crib.
I have the first gift that was given to me when I was born.
This is my notebook from senior year in high school.
Have you tried drugs?
What kind of drugs?
Antidepressants.
That doesn't work either.
There is only one thing they did make a dramatic difference.
There is a book called  'Buddhism Boys'.
It's about a teacher who taught mindfulnes to high school football players.
"I think, boys particularly can see the relationship to sports."
That's a big inroad.
(R. Brady) I don't think we will have time to answer more questions right now.
"But, there are going to be a lot  of opportunities to raise questions of various kinds  throughout the rest of the week."

"It's not a very busy web service, you do not need to worry about being flooded with emails. but it's very thoughtful."
"So, I want to encourage all of you  to pick up a flyer."
We also have a conference annually.
"We have Canadians who come to our conference, that gets announced."
It will be March 14 to16  in Washington D.C. this next year.
There is a lot of resources on our website that you will find also listed here.
(J. Bell) I'd like to do one plug for a book that I found very nourishing.
It's called 'Teaching With Fire'.
"Two teachers asked teachers to sent them poems to guard them through hard times,  to remind them why they taught."
They talk about courage.
There are about 100 poems in here.
On one side is the poems sent by the teacher.
On the other is the teachers' own story about why this poem is important.
"I have used this in my teaching, in my training work and for my own personal use."
"I've used poem to cry through, beautiful collection of poems, some of them written by famous people, some by teachers themselves."
'Teaching With Fire'.

"If the only nuclear DNA that goes into this hybrid cell is thylacine DNA, that's the only thing that can pop out the other end of the devil."
"OK, if we can do this, could we put it back?"
This is a key question for everybody.
"Does it have to stay in a laboratory, or could we put it back where it belongs?"
"Could we put it back in the throne of the king of beasts in Tasmania, restore that ecosystem?"
Or has Tasmania changed so much that that's no longer possible?
I've been to Tasmania.
I've been to many of the areas where the thylacines were common.
"I've even spoken to people, like Peter Carter here, who when I spoke to him, was 90 years old, but in 1926, this man and his father and his brother caught thylacines."
They trapped them.
"And when I spoke to this man, I was looking in his eyes and thinking,"
"""Behind those eyes is a brain that has memories of what thylacines feel like, what they smelled like, what they sounded like."""
He led them around on a rope.
He has personal experiences that I would give my left leg to have in my head.
We'd all love to have this sort of thing happen.
"Anyway, I asked Peter, by any chance, could he take us back to where he caught those thylacines."
My interest was in whether the environment had changed.
He thought hard.
It was nearly 80 years before this that he'd been at this hut.
"At any rate, he led us down this bush track, and there, right where he remembered, was the hut, and tears came into his eyes."
He looked at the hut.
We went inside.
There were the wooden boards on the sides of the hut where he and his father and his brother had slept at night.
"And he told me, as it all was flooding back in memories."
"He said, ""I remember the thylacines going around the hut wondering what was inside,"" and he said they made sounds like ""Yip!"
Yip!
"Yip!"""
All of these are parts of his life and what he remembers.
"And the key question for me was to ask Peter, has it changed?"
And he said no.
The southern beech forests surrounded his hut just like it was when he was there in 1926.
The grasslands were sweeping away.
(R. Brady) Thank you.
(Woman in the audience) You mentioned that singing about flowers may not necessarily reach teens effectively.
"So, I was wondering if one of you can express what might be the best way to mindfully communicate with teenagers."
(K. Weare) I was not trying to say that nobody should sing songs about flowers with kids.
"But again, just taking the Mindfulness  in Schools Program from the UK, which is a Teens Program, it basically does things that are quite edgy, and exciting."
"For example, tasting."
It's chocolate but it's also hot chili which excites some of the kids.
"The next workshop, we use a shock ball, which gives an amount of electric shock to illustrate aversion."
(Laughter)
"It's very mild, I would say."
(Laughter)
We haven't lost too many yet.
(Laughter)
"But things like using clips, some films, some current pop music, and so on."
"And using language,  so you won't use mindfulness."
"We use MindLab or Emotional Warrior, or something of that sort."
"You talk about sports, you talk  about surviving life in a club."
You basically stop where they are.
It comes down to knowing your teens and working how you talk to them about anything really.
Translating the work of mindfulness  into the examples and language that you would use.
"There is a lot of stuff in pop music  that you could choose to play if you want to talk about being  in the moment, and ethics and so on."
"There is just a lot out there, you just need to get the head on, which is seeing the world  from the teen's point of view."
And use the teen themselves to tell you  what works with that group.
"So there is a lot, it's really  about the spectacles you put on before you start teaching more than sort of specifics."
(Woman) I am speaking from a parent's perspective rather than a teacher's.
"I would get someone else to teach, then."
(Laughter)
"(J. Miller) Just bringing the mindfulness to boys,"
I think one of the things is sports.
There are lots of people  in the sport world using this.
"The classic book is Phil Jackson's, who was coach of Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers."
He brought mindfulness right into a working coaching.
"I think this graph is the most important graph in all of health policy and I'm not lying or exaggerating, okay."
"There are at least two important lessons to be drawn from this graph, three important lessons."
So the three points of this is we're on another planet when it comes to health care spending.
"This is, the characteristic of a"
luxury good not in necessity and we could get down a considerable amount without the necessity for rationing.
That's why I think this graph is.
The most important graph in health care policy.
"I would also say for those of you who are a real nerds,"
look at these hours squares.
You don't get this kind of correlation.
In any other social science.
You just don't.
You barely got this in the biological sciences and you really have to go to Physics to get these kind of co-relations.
A perfect correlation is 1.0.
"We're spending $7,300 per person in 2007, corrected the next highest country as I mention, Norway."
"Switzerland is number three, $4,763."
Okay?
"So, compared to that, over 50 percent higher than they're spending."
"Now, some people and I won't get in this today will say, well, a large part of that is prices."
We pay more so our MRls cost more.
Our doctors have turns out have higher salaries than doctors in Europe.
Our nurses get paid more.
A day in the hospital in the United States is more expensive than a day in France.
"All true, doesn't eliminate this gap, okay."
"Might reduce it by half, doesn't eliminate it."
Plenty of rich otherwise healthy countries are down below the average.
"New Zealand, right?"
"Korea, South Korea, okay?"
"So, you don't have to, you know, even Finland is just [inaudible]."
You could be a perfectly fine country and spend a lot less than you're spending.
"I mean, these are countries spending a third of what we're"

But if you ask Swedes if everyone in India should have a washing machine many would say that not every Indian household should.
They don't get that people are all the same.
"If I have a washing machine, so should everyone else."
People think Indians shouldn't have washing machines?
Not if they think about it.
But that's the general reaction.
Isn't it really that they're poor and can't afford one?
Consider the planning for how much electricity is needed on earth.
"Work out what we need for lighting, a washing machine, radio and TV."
That gives you the power we need.
None of my students have suggested that the world should be planned for that consumption.
"They hope ""those"" people will be playing flutes under the mango tree."
Isn't that a very generalized image of the students?
"There's a lot of variation, but a surprisingly large number hope that development will stop."
They think it's unsustainable.
We often hear that we already live beyond our means.
"""Everyone can't live like us."
"All Chinese people can't have cars."""
That's what we usually hear.
But the world can't function if we don't all live about the same.
How can the world unite if we don't live in the same conditions?
There's such appeal in having electricity and having some kind of holiday.
I dropped out of high school  with a baby on the way.
"I had no home, no money  and no help."
I put my hope in the crime on the streets.
"At the time, that scene  was my only option."
Crime on the streets eventually led me to jail.
I came close to death many times.
The lost that changed ...
"The lost that changed my life was the violent death of my younger brother."""
"It was 1967, Mike found his way into Youth Build program in Columbus, Ohio."
"And today, 14 years later, he is the director of his own Youth Build program, he is a minister of his own congregation, he is the owner of his own  construction company."
He has a family and 4 children  and he owns his own home.
"There are millions of young people who have this aspirations, they want  the same thing that you and I want."
"They want to know their true nature,  they want to know their value, they want to make a contribution, and they want to be able to support their families and be happy and safe, right?"
"Yet, because of poverty and racism,  they have been denied that opportunity."
And the schools have failed them.
You all who worked in some of those school have tried your best to counteract that.
Youth Build is developed  as a place for them to land.
"We started,my wife and long-time partner,  Dorothy Stoneman, who is right here, started Youth Build in 1978  at East Harlem, New York."
We as young people had some adult  back-up and some money to do.
"So, I stared across the street and said, ""I would like to fix up that building""."
It took us 5 years to do that first building.
"Starting there step-by-step,  there are now 273 Youth Build programs in the country's poorest communities and 16 other countries like South Africa,"
"Serbia, Haiti, Mexico."
"They asked us to come  by Afghanistan lately, I said:"
"""Wait!"
"Get your things together first, then we'll think about that."""
"They spent about a year in the program,  going to school, getting the GED diploma."
"Half the time they add and had the time building affordable houses for lower income people, learning leadership skills."
In this process they reclaim their lives.
Here are some elements that I think will work and we know about them here.
One is caring and love.
They come in pretty beat-up  by racism and poverty.
"Coleen knows that I'm giving a message to her, and she can open that message and know that it goes to Alice."
It doesn't require the first one.
"If Bob see me talking with Coleen, presumably that's not a problem."
It doesn't require the second if Bob sees Coleen talking with Alice.
That's also not a problem.
"If Bob sees both of those and sees them in quick succession, especially if he sees the envelopes being handed on, then he's got a good reason to suspect that I'm talking with Alice."
So we need both of these properties.
"We need to know that Coleen can be trusted, and we need to know that Bob can't see both of these transactions."
Those are pretty high security assumptions.
"We don't want to have to trust Coleen completely, and we don't want to rely on the fact that Bob can't see these two conversations."
The way to make it more secure is to add a third person--
let's say we know Edgar as well.
"Now instead of giving the message directly to Coleen, what I'm going to do is take the envelope for Coleen, put that inside an envelope for Edgar."
We need to fold things a little to make them fit.
Now I'm going to seal this envelope with a very secure seal that only Edgar can open.
Now I'll give this to envelope to Edgar.
"Edgar will open it, see that it has an message for Coleen."
Edgar will give the message to Coleen.
"Coleen will open that, see that it has a message for Alice, give the message to Alice."
Alice will open the message and see that she shouldn't eat the onion.
This has more protection.
Now Coleen doesn't know that I'm communicating with Alice.
Because the message is going like this:
"It's going first to Edgar, then to Coleen, then to Alice."
"Neither Edgar, nor Coleen knows that I'm communicating with Alice."
Edgar knows that I'm sending a message through him that goes to Coleen.
"Coleen knows that she's receiving a message from Edgar, and it's going to Alice."
Neither one knows both endpoints.
"If we add enough hops, this can start to be quite secure."
This is actually called onion routing.
That's why the message is to not eat the onion.
The name comes from the idea that an onion has all these layers.
And so there's a couple of ways we can think about it.
"If this leg is supporting 35 Newtons and we have a total weight here of 120 Newtons, our total weight, the weight at the top of the table plus the bookshelf, that's 120 Newtons."
So the balance of this must be supported by something or someone.
So the balance of this is going to be supported by this leg.
So it's 120 minus 35 is what?
[PHONE RlNGS]
"Oh, my phone is ringing."
120 minus 35 is what?
120 minus 30 is 90.
And then 90 minus 5 is 85 Newtons.
It's so disconcerting when my phone rings.
I have trouble focusing.
"Anyway, it's probably because my phone sounds"
like a freight train.
"Anyway, so there you go."
"This type of problem is actually key to, as you can imagine, bridge builders, or furniture manufacturers, or civil engineers who are bridge builders, or architects, because you actually have to figure out, well, if I design something a certain way, I have to figure out how much weight each of the supporting structures will have to support."
"And as you can imagine, why is this one supporting more weight?"
Why is this leg supporting more weight than that leg?
"Well, because this book, which is 100 Newtons, which is a significant amount of the total weight, is much closer to this leg than it is to this leg."
"If we put it to the center, they would balance, and then if we push it further to the right, then this leg would start bearing more of the weight."
"Anyway, hopefully you found that interesting, and hopefully, I didn't confuse you."
And I will see you in future videos.
One day a one-eyed monkey came into the forest.
Under a tree she saw a woman meditating furiously.
"The one-eyed monkey recognized the woman, a Sekhri."
She was the wife of an even more famous Brahmin.
"To watch her better, the one-eyed monkey climbed onto the tree."
"Just then, with a loud bang, the heavens opened."
(Claps)
And the god Indra jumped into the clearing.
"Indra saw the woman, a Sekhri."
Ah-hah.
"We're going to have to draw a lot of things, we're going to have to draw a lot of states."
That's kind of difficult.
And the answer was yes.
That's the point.
"It's these little pieces and these little touches that don't necessarily have a practical purpose that demonstrate to people that hey, if they thought that much about this, then think about how much work they put into the actual search results."
"Now, you have to be careful with this because it's a very, very strong message to send."
You have to make sure that your product backs it up.
So how do we apply this to thinking to products?
"Well, it doesn't have to be the large things."
"The Pac-Man example, the effort to actually make the game was a lot smaller than to produce the search results."
But simply ask yourself this question.
What are the things that I can do that I don't have to?
"So that said, here's a couple pieces of reading that we recommend that you look into to find out more about some of these topics, like affordances and natural mapping, an in Don"
"Norman's book, or the mental models in Alan Cooper's classic, About Face."
"And for typography and layout, one of my favorites is The"
Elements of Typographic Style.
"Tomorrow, there a number of design sessions relating to"
"Android development, so take advantage of those."
ALEX FAABORG:
Let's move onto questions.
[APPLAUSE]
"And it was supposed to be on the slide, but tomorrow at 5:30 PM at the W Hotel in the living room, we're going to be having drinks with the Android Design Team."
"So if you guys want to stop by, that should be a lot of fun."
And we're really eager to take your questions.
We've got quite a bit of time.
So go ahead.
AUDlENCE:
"I don't actually have a question, I just want to say that was the best presentation I've had since"
"I've been here, so thank you guys."
ALEX FAABORG:
You're welcome.
CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
"So, instead of, you know, looking for new sources of water, we can look for this source we already have."
"So getting into Greywater, one of the first questions is, is this legal?"
Like can I do this legally?
And the regulations around Greywater have been changing over the last couple of decades.
Greywater used to be viewed as sewage.
"It was part of just the whole water stream going down out of the house, considered sewage, dangerous, you can't reuse it."
And certainly over time it's been shifted to be seen as a resource to be able to be used for non-potable sources.
"So in California, we were the first State to have a code."
It was written in 1992.
"And it was a code, it's a plumbing code designed to allow people to reuse Greywater."
"But the way it was written, it really was more of a disposable code and so people weren't able to do that--to use"
--actually reuse it.
They were kind of asked to dispose of it deep under the ground.
"And so, between 1992 and 2009, pretty much all Greywater Systems were done without a permit, which were--they were technically illegal because the code really wasn't in line with why people want to use it, how it was practical to use."
"And so, there's millions of un-permitted systems."
"And last year, a bit--a lot of--there was drought, there was a lot pressure of reducing water."
"And so, there was a big push to rewrite the code and make it actually fit with Greywater being a resource."
"And so, the Department of Housing and Community Development wrote a new code."
And a lot of people were involved in that to really make it so we could use
Greywater as a resource.
"And so, from last year and onward to the future, Greywater is seen as a resource."
And we're going to show you some simple and legal ways that you can reuse it. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Better safe than sorry. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
Yeah. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; What's the legal way [INDlSTlNCT] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
We'll get to that in one second.
Yeah.
Good.
It's actually right here.
"So,"
Greywater--who has heard of Greywater?
All of you.
"So, anyone have a Greywater System? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Not yet. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:"
Not yet?
"It was accepted, but they, they said, you know, do you have something on cancer?"
[laugh]
"So, naturally, he was younger and needed publications more than I did."
"So I, I sort of fell on my sword."
[laugh].
"Withdrew my paper from the Annals of Epidemiology and, and combined it with his and the New England Journal took it."
"Wow, yeah."
So even I was faced with a salami problem as an author.
"So those our the, the things Yeah, sorting those things out Yes Early can be very helpful."
And what do you think is if you have to point to one thing that number one mistake that scientist make when submitting their paper for publication?
I think it's overconfidence in how important.
And how good there study is.
[laugh].
"You know, you've worked on it really hard."
Yeah.
And done your best to write it up.
And this was an important topic or question that was really important to you.
"And you think, oh gosh, this is really an important finding, but others may not value it so I. [laugh]."
"So if it gets rejected I would do this, some factor like that."
"I would persist, I think it's important to persist and submit it elsewhere."
Fix it and submit it elsewhere.
"Yeah, finding the right journal for it might be the."
"Might be the key, yeah."
Right but you know just because you've devoted a year or two to this project you think its really important don't assume that other people will place it as high priority as you do.
"Yeah, yeah that's a good point and I have to profess you go give some advice to authors about writing style because you've written a number of editorials in American Journal of Epidemiology dealing with writing."
Mm-hm.
Right.
So what advice do you have to the writing?
"Well, I guess clarity and conciseness are what I would put as the highest priority."
Characteristics of writing avoid repetition.
Sometimes people will say something in the introduction and then repeat it in the discussion.
"Avoid that or they'll say something in the method section, which gets repeated in results."
"For six months, heavy rains cause rivers to rise."
Forests to flood.
The Amazon and its tributaries overflow an area about the size of California.
Which poses real problems for ants.
Their homes can be covered with over 30 feet of water for months at a time.
"To survive the flood, ants need to build an ark."
It's a raft.
A miracle of biological engineering.
"None of the ants are submerged, or even get wet."
"Their water-repellent bodies push against the surface, shaping it into a bowl-- without breaking the surface tension."
Nature's Noahs are number 8 in the countdown because the ant's ark can ride out the flood for months.
It holds millions of passengers with zero casualties.
Unless it runs into pirates.
Heat is another killer.
"Out of the shade of the forest, the larvae are suffering."
Workers carry them to the edge of the raft and dip them in the cool water.
The fight for survival doesn't end when the colony runs aground.
Scouts race ahead to find a new nest site.
Others unload the women and children.
Soon the ants will be safe in a new nest.
Until the next flood.
Drought is deadly.
"Without water, some animals are forced to leave."
Others do something unbelievable.
Tiger salamanders become cannibals.
"In the shallow ponds of Arizona, juvenile tiger salamanders come in two types-- both with feathery gills."
Mom has no gills and lays eggs.
But not all eggs are created equal.
Scientists discovered the tiger salamander has a unique way to survive drought.
Some eggs carry the genetic blueprints to become harmless plankton feeders.
Others become cannibals.
"A month after hatching, they transform into killers, with big teeth and big heads."
In order to keep all of this running smoothly it's important to establish the clear roles and responsibilities for maintenance of the shared drives.
That brings me to the end of the presentation.
I just want to say thank you.
Paulette Murray:
It looks like you answered any questions people might have had.
Did you want to say anything else before we close out?
Beth Cron:
"No, just thank you for attending today and I'd like to hear any comments or questions that you have."
Paulette Murray:
Okay.
Thank you so much Beth.
You did a wonderful job.
I think a lot of people appreciate it.
Looks like you have some applause coming from the crowd.
Actually we do have a question from Walter before we do that.
"""How many files / bytes did the NARA project take on?"" Good question Walter."
Beth Cron:
Yes that is a good question.
"Off the top, I know there are several shared drives at NARA."
"A couple terabytes, I think, each."
I don't have the exact numbers.
But they were getting quite large.
Hence the need for a cleanup project.
I can answer any questions about the shared drive bulletin.
"But if you do have specific questions, it's best to talk with your NARA appraisal archivist, who is more familiar with your agency and can better answer any specific questions you might have."
Paulette Murray:
"Alright, once again thank you Beth for a great presentation."
Thank you to everyone who had questions or participated in the discussion.
"We'll be hosting other upcoming online briefings, so please keep your ears out for the fliers that we send out so that you can register for those."
And please look for updates about other online things we're offering here at NARA.
"We have the new fiscal year 13 online course schedule online, I believe."
I will put that link into the chat box after I'm done.
That's classic thylacine habitat.
And the animals in those areas were the same that were there when the thylacine was around.
So could we put it back?
Yes.
Is that all we would do?
And this is an interesting question.
"Sometimes you might be able to put it back, but is that the safest way to make sure it never goes extinct again?"
And I don't think so.
"I think gradually, as we see species all around the world, it's kind of a mantra that wildlife is increasingly not safe in the wild."
"We'd love to think it is, but we know it isn't."
We need other parallel strategies coming online.
And this one interests me.
"Some of the thylacines that were being turned in to zoos, sanctuaries, even at the museums, had collar marks on the neck."
"They were being kept as pets, and we know a lot of bush tales and memories of people who had them as pets, and they say they were wonderful, friendly."
This particular one came in out of the forest to lick this boy and curled up around the fireplace to go to sleep.
A wild animal.
And I'd like to ask the question.
We need to think about this.
"If it had not been illegal to keep these thylacines as pets then, would the thylacine be extinct now?"
And I'm positive it wouldn't.
We need to think about this in today's world.
"Could it be that getting animals close to us so that we value them, maybe they won't go extinct?"
"And this is such a critical issue for us because if we don't do that, we're going to watch more of these animals plunge off the precipice."
"As far as I'm concerned, this is why we're trying to do these kinds of de-extinction projects."
We are trying to restore that balance of nature that we have upset.
Thank you.
(Applause)

"And I would ask her, I would say,"
"""Man, why are you saying this?"
There are people that are listening in.
"I mean, I got 30, 40 thousand peopel listening to me at one time."
"You mean to tell me that there's nobody listening to the ideas I'm trying to convey and you know, things I'm trying to do,"" and, no."
"No, she said."
So...
"I mean, and now that all this--"
"It's not the first time this kind of shit has happened, so I kind of gotten closer to mywife because of that man."
"Even though she didn't believe what I was doing, she still stood by me."
"She still, you know, accepted the fact that I was in another room while she was attending to whatever she was attending to and it just puts life into perspective that I don't want to end up like"
"Bright Bart and all these other people that, they made small dents in an attempt to... to try to..."
"I guess, make some kind of change or expose some sort of contradiction or expose hypocracy, but I just want to live life, baby."
You know aht I mean?
"I just wanted to live life, that's all there is to it, man."
So... anyway.
"Open mic, not in my office."
I'm talking about when I was outside my office work.
"I'm talking about when I spent time in here, you know what I mean?"
"I've been spending a lot of time in the chatroom here outside of the show, you knwo what I'm saying?"
"So, I mean that's time away from my wife."
"I mean, look, you know, my traditional office hourse are my traditional office hours, but when I'm at home at, you know, 8, 9 PM, 3 AM, early in the morning,"
"I mean, you know... she's here, she's here now."
You know what I mean and you know she's...
"I just feel bad that I sat here and neglected her unconditional companionship and instead, being politcally, but not really political, but I guess romantic in another direction, you know aht I mean?"
"So, I think I'm gonna spend a lot more time with her, man, and not only that, my family, my family that I've discussed, you know what I mean?"
"So, in my personal opinion, it's over man."
There's nothing I can do.
"There's nothing I can do, I've done everything."
The world is the way it is.
"I've got a few years left, a few good years left,"
"I've got some pretty good years left in me, so might as well-- like I said,"
"And then I want to add this 2p minus 1 here, so plus 2p minus 1."
And what do I get?
These cancel out.
These cancel with that.
And these guys cancel out.
So there's a total of p squared possible A's where the determinant of A is divisible by p.
"Now, we're very close, but this isn't what they're asking."
They want the total members where the determinant of A is not divisible by p.
"So all we have to do here is take our total membership, which is p to the third, and subtract from that the members whose determinants are divisible by p."
And we just figured that out.
We subtract p squared.
And now we'll get the number of A's where determinant of A not divisible by p.
"Now let's see if that's one of the choices, and it is."
"D, p cubed minus p squared."
Mary Shelly wrote Frankenstein.
"If there is one monster that you know by name, you may think its Frankenstein."
"Of course, if you remember the book, Frankenstein is actually the name of the individual who brings the creature to life."
The monster is unnamed entirely.
Not every memory is 100 percent reliable.
"For example, the most common image of Mary Shelley shows her as a mature woman."
"While you read the book, it might be worth bearing in mind that she was only eighteen years old when she began writing it."
"Also, there are two introductions to the book in most of the available editions these days, one written in 1818, one written in 1831, both nominally by Mary Shelley."
"Some people feel that the first one was written by her husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley."
"But since he died in 1822, the 1831 preface is certainly hers."
These are not random additions to the novel.
I ask you to read those before you read the text itself.
"Finally, as you read the book, you might be wanting to keep in mind that the book is constructed with different narrative voices, speaking to us, through each other."
Are all of those voices equally trustworthy?
Is every narrator truly reliable?
"What are their motives in saying what they say, and the way they say it?"
"They do, after all, live in a world with monsters."
"I'm the trouble starter,  punking' instigator"
- Why do you think it appeared to you?
"I believe the demonic can appear as an apparition... ...much like a ghost, in an attempt to excite our fear."
"- Did it excite your fear, Father?"
- It scared the hell out of me.
"So this night, when you began to prepare Emily's exorcism... ...was it your first encounter with this demon ghost?"
- Yes.
- Have you seen it again?
I've seen it ever since.
No further questions at this time.
"Redirect, Your Honor."
"Father Moore, after you received the bishop's authorization... ...when did you proceed with an exorcism?"
October 31st.
On Halloween.
Isn't that a bit dramatic?
Halloween tradition is based on legends throughout history... ...that indicate a real increase in spiritual activity on that night... ...and I thought we could use the occasion to draw them into the open.
"- The demons, you mean?"
- Yes.
Father Moore... ...can you identify this?
It's my tape recorder.
I used it to record the exorcism.
Inside is the tape I made that night.
Why would you make such a tape?
Ever since the technology has been available... ...exorcists have used tape recorders to authenticate the ritual... ...and provide a record for review.
I offer into evidence this cassette recorder and audiotape...
Objection.
The people were not aware of the existence of this tape... ...until last night.
- Neither were we.
This tape is new evidence that came into our possession yesterday.
We provided counsel for the people with a transcript of its contents.
You mean this tape was not given to you by your client?
"No, Your Honor."
"We received it from a reluctant witness... ...Dr. Graham Cartwright, who will also be called to testify to its authenticity."
"""If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things."""
May we ever continue to do so.
I thank you for your faith and devotion to the gospel.
I thank you for the love and care you show one to another.
I thank you for the service you provide in your wards and branches and in your stakes and districts.
It is such service that enables the Lord to accomplish many of His purposes here upon the earth.
I express my thanks to you for your kindnesses to me wherever I go.
I thank you for your prayers in my behalf.
I have felt those prayers and am most grateful for them.
"Now, my brothers and sisters, we have come to be instructed and inspired."
Many messages will be shared during the next two days.
I can assure you that those men and women who will address you have sought heaven's help and direction as they have prepared their messages.
They have been inspired concerning that which they will share with us.
Our Heavenly Father is mindful of each of us and our needs.
May we be filled with His Spirit as we partake of the proceedings of this conference.
"This is my sincere prayer in the sacred name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, amen."
"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen."
"My name is Art Benjamin, and I am a ""mathemagician."""
"What that means is, I combine my loves of math and magic to do something I call ""mathemagics."""
"But before I get started, I have a quick question for the audience."
"By any chance, did anyone happen to bring with them this morning a calculator?"
"Seriously, if you have a calculator with you, raise your hand."
Raise your hand.
Did your hand go up?
"Now bring it out, bring it out."
Anybody else?
"I see, I see one way in the back."
"You sir, that's three."
And anybody on this side here?
"OK, over there on the aisle."
"Would the four of you please bring out your calculators, then join me up on stage."
Let's give them a nice round of applause.
There's an not a decade long period.
Where you have health care expenditures less than the growth in GDP or equal to the growth in GDP.
"And you can see in almost every year, here it's almost two%."
"Here it's almost three%, it is three percent 1990s last and we'll talk about this in a second."
An d you can see in this period 2-1/2%.
"Overall, 2.4 percent for 40 years.You're on, you're on, those of who have understood the idea of compound interest."
"That makes a grow, grow, grow."
"But I do wanted, draw your attention."
"There is one year there, one year, one decade, the 1990s where it only grew 1.3 percent above GDP."
What was happening do you think in the 1990s that did that?
"Could, empower, that's right."
So 1993 he takes office in January.
He attends to introduce health care reform and get
National Health Coverage and what happens?
"It was defeated, that's right."
"Lots of reasons why it was defeated and we'll talk about that on the first session of the ACA why, what some of the differences are but it was defeated."
One of the reasons it was defeated was.
The passed Congress.
"Yes, that's correct."
But that means it wasn't a coalition.
Who pulled out of the coalition?
Businesses.
And they pulled out because they thought they could get a better deal somewhere else and the thought was the manage care companies came to them and said we can hold your cost down.
You don't need the government.
And the way they were going to do it was with manage care and then what happened.
So one thing that happened is that reduce choice and
Americans rebelled because at that time the main mechanism that manage can control the cost was to reduce what they paid doctors but also restrict choices of the population.
"There was a line going around in the 1990s, one 800 just say no."
That's what happened.
Men's care company gave you an 800 number if you didn't like their decisions and all that happened at the other 800 number just say no.
And the consequence was.
Manage care was able to control cost for a short period of time and we'll see about five years but then towards the end of the 90s cost went up.
That's all going to be possible in just a few months.
"Now, we have the Sony Bravia over to my right just to simulate the Google TV living room experience."
"And for the sake of all of your eyes, we'll be projecting Google TV back on the screen behind me."
Let's see if we can get it started.
There we go.
"So, everyone clear on everything?"
We're going to get started with the demo.
You notice here I'm watching TV as if I normally would in my living room.
I can change channels;
I can do all the same things I usually would.
"With one button, I can press the search button and bring down this box."
"And for up here, I can type in any URL."
So let's go straight to YouTube.
"In just a few seconds, YouTube.com is going to be loading."
"Now, you notice this transition between TV and web was completely seamless."
"I didn't need to change my input channel, I didn't need to use a different remote; the web just became an extension of my TV."
So I'm here on YouTube and I can do any of the same things I could do in my computer.
So let's search for something to watch.
The Salt's video trailer came out just a couple of months ago; let's see if we can find that here.
"Again, just like on my computer, now"
I can see it and I can go click on the link and watch the video.
"Now, one of the great things about YouTube is that as camera technology has improved, more and more people are uploading high resolution video."
This means that it makes a great experience when you navigate into full screen.
So let's try that now.
"So, the video is rendering and we're actually"
"going to be using hardware acceleration in the Google TV devices to make this rendering happen very, very fast."
Let's see if this actually is rendering.
All right.
"Well, let"
"me show you another example of YouTube, oh, this is what happened; the play button was not started."
Minor details when you're watching a video.
There we go.
"But I think, for obvious reasons, we can just skip that particular punchline and instead, silently ponder why"
Megan made the poor decisions that she made.
"Joking aside, it should now be burnt indelibly into your brains that I am the best man."
"But I hear some of you asking, ""Why would Bayley, somebody so obviously filled with bitter jealousy and feelings of inadequesy, pick somebody as awesome as David to be his best man?"" The truth is, I am as stumped as you."
"Don't get me wrong, I am Bayley's best friend in the whole wide world - closer to a brother, really."
"But Bayley, he is just my ..."
"I don't know... what is closer than a stranger, but still shy of pal...?"
"""Casual work acquaintance""?"
"No, I would need a job for that to be the case... ah well, we'll come back to that."
After all...
I can't ignore his lovely bride!
Heh heh heh...
"Megan, I actually want to use this time to appologize for the way we have treated you."
"To be mocked about your height for so many years by me, my brothers, friends, family, strangers on the street, well, it simply isn't fair to you."
"And to know that you've actually looked up to me all this time, metaphorically speaking, of course..."
"Well, I'm sorry for all of it."
I will try and be more respectful from here on out.
"That's a lovely dress, by the way."
Does it come in an adult size?
"Darn it, I didn't even make it a full 10 seconds into my resolution."
"Here, to make it up to you, I will now improvise a touching poem, just for the two of you."
"Now if you notice that I am still scrolling down my speech, understand that I am simply doing that for continuity."
"Ugh, starting is always the hard part."
"I dunno, uhh... roses."
Roses are... red!
Violets are... violet?
"No, I know there is something better."
"Come on David, you can do this."
"Roses are red, Violets are blue,"
"Today we learn what they already knew, This beautiful couple makes their official debut, Put themselves up for their familiar review,"
"Verdict comes in, it was worth the pursue,"
"Pastor asks, ""Do you and do you?"""
But there are 100's and 1000's of you taking this class currently.
"Your talking to each other is going to be more powerful, a learning tool."
"So say, for example, I make an error, and actually I have made errors in the videos, but I don't try to fix them and, you know, cut out that clip, simply because we all make mistakes."
"I correct them in real time with you, and usually they're small."
And I guarantee you they will be small.
"But is you find something don't say, Oh, you know, Suwarth Gottum made a mistake."
"Well, you make mistakes, I make mistakes."
Your attitude should be sorting out what that mistake is.
Finally.
This class is about ambiguity and learning.
And I would encourage you to take that attitude towards it.
Okay?
"One last thing, which I feel compelled to talk about because I have prepared most of the class, and I want it to share with you."
Why did I say yes to it?
Why did I choose to do something online?
The first reason is I believe education should be accessible to all.
Why do I believe that?
Because I believe education almost is like a right.
It's almost like a right to breathe.
"I do have strong views about it, but I genuinely believe that education makes you become empowered."
The most valuable investment you could ever make is education.
What do I mean by that?
"Remember, if you want electricity, which is good, you're willing to burn coal."
"However burning coal leads to some problems, some costs on society, and on you too."
Education is an investment that
largely gives your benefits.
Why wouldn't you want to do that?
Why wouldn't you to make an investment in yourself.
"My goal, in this investment, is to empower you not to be dependent on a coach like me or any other person."
"But to take this class and say, I can do it too, and that's the beauty of education."
I'll make couple more points and then we'll see each other in about a week.
This has been a real challenge for me as a teacher.
The correct answer is:
"When evil is legal, become a criminal."
"When oppression is enacted as ""law,"" become a law-breaker."
When those violently victimizing the innocent have badges become a cop-killer. so the next time you hear of a police officer being killed in the line of duty take a moment to consider the very real possibility that maybe in that case the law enforcer was the bad guy and the cop killer was the good guy.
"As it happens, that has been the case more often than not throughout human history."
Stephen:
Come with me in the airplane and you are
looking at the instrument panel and you are flying in the clouds.
You can't see a thing.
Imagine.
"Now you are born deaf, profoundly deaf."
"If you have never heard anything in your life, how is it that you can fly airplanes?"
How is it that you can hear people teach you how to talk?
I am that person.
Announcer:
"""The guy just blew me away."" ""One of the best speeches I have ever heard."""
"""He's funny, poignant and he's lived it."""
That's what people are saying about Stephen Hopson.
A passionate and entertaining speaker.
His message about overcoming adversity comes from his heart and his own experience.
"Deaf since birth, Stephen never let his disability become an obstacle to achieving his dreams and reaching his goals."
"In February of 2006, Stephen became the world's first instrument rated deaf pilot."
A dream which began in childhood.
Stephen:
"When I was 4 years old, I begged my mother to take me to the airport so I could watch planes take off and land."
Did you ever do that?
"OK, so you know what I am talking about."
"Remember, I am 4 years old!"
My mother would park her car by the fence and I would be so eager because I wanted to be a pilot.
I would hop out of the car and I would run up to the fence and I would put my fingers on the wires of the fence and I would wait for a plane to come out.
"The minute a plane came out, I would put my head on the hood of her car, like this... and then I would wait for an airplane to take off."
"And as soon as that plane took off, the car would vibrate."
"Let's say that I have a 5-Newton force, and its moment arm distance is 4."
The distance is equal to 4.
That's enough for that side.
And let's say I have a I'm going to switch colors.
"Actually, no, I'm going to keep it all the same color and then we'll use colors to differentiate between clockwise and counterclockwise so I don't bungle everything up again."
So let's say I have a 10-Newton force here.
"And, of course, these vectors aren't proportional to actually what I drew."
50 Newtons would be huge if these were the actual vectors.
And let's say that that moment arm distance is 3.
Let me do a couple more.
And let's say I have a moment arm distance of 8.
"I have a clockwise force of 20 Newtons, And let's say at a distance of 10 again, so distance is equal to 10, I have my mystery force."
It's going to act in a counterclockwise direction and
I want to know what it needs to be.
"So whenever you do any of these moment of force problems, and you say, well, what does the force need to be in order for this see saw to not rotate?"
"You just say, well, all the clockwise moments have to equal all of the counterclockwise moments, So clockwise moments equal counterclockwise."
I'll do them in different colors.
So what are all the clockwise moments?
"Well, clockwise is this direction, right?"
That's the way a clock goes.
"So this is clockwise, that is clockwise."
I want to go in this direction.
And so this is clockwise.
What are all the clockwise moments?
It's 10 Newtons times its moment arm distance 10.
"So 10 times 10 plus 5 Newtons times this moment arm distance 4, plus 5 times 4, plus 20 Newtons times its moment arm distance of 8, plus 20 times 8, and that's going to equal the counterclockwise moments, and so the leftover ones are counterclockwise."
"So we have 50 Newtons acting downward here, and that's counterclockwise, and it's at a distance of 8 from the moment arm, so 50 times 8."
"Let's see, we don't have any other counterclockwise on that side."
"This is counterclockwise, right?"
"We have 10 Newtons acting in the counterclockwise direction, and its moment arm distance is 3, plus 10 times 3, and we're assuming our mystery force, which is at a distance of 10, is also counterclockwise, plus force times 10."
And now we simplify.
And I'll just go to a neutral color because this is just math now.

Charlie says that helping youth learn skills is a source of pride and inspiration.
"Maybe not so much for his grandson, Andrew."
But for other local champs like Billy Bugenig it just might be.
I worked with him on some ranches when I was growing up.
He taught me a lot.
He always knew the way the cattle were going to move.
I learned a lot by watching him.
I met Charlie at a really young age when I was just learning how to rope.
You knew that every time you went and you roped with Charlie you had a chance to win.
When I started team roping and stuff when
"I got into high school, he was always there to help and he was always someone that I looked up to because he knew how to do everything."
And I always enjoyed and still to this day would rope with Charlie any time or anywhere he wanted to.
Champs.
"Those kids, I tell you."
They're good.
"Ya, he still should have a good shot."
He's always able to catch something.
What we're gonna do is to look at the difference between cooking with the regular old-fashioned range and an induction cooktop.
So what we're gonna do today is focus on what happens when you cook it on a regular conventional range.
"What we've got is a GE (if you want to show that, Honey)"
We've got a GE range that's maybe three years old.
"And it has this glass cooktop, which we're told is about as efficient as the old-fashioned kind with the radiant elements."
"So I'm just going to pull our Lodge cast iron skillet out of the cabinet, put it on this main eye that we use, and I'm going to set it on a range from zero to (I guess) an imputed 10 because it's like 2-4-6-8-high,"
I'm going to set it on 8.
And you can see here what's happening here is as the element heats up it's going to heat up that skillet.
But it heats it up very slowly.
"Now I'm going to get some olive oil, which we use when we're cooking our eggs."
"What we're cooking is a frled egg for Amanda and a scrambled egg for me, with a little bit of veggies and some cheese in it."
We'll get that ready for Amanda's egg.
[Cabinet door closes]
"Oh, and I didn't notice when I turned it on; it's probably been on now for maybe 15-20 seconds (Note: actually about 45 seconds)"
"One day I was recommended a book written by an American (then was not none), named ""the shack"" (the refuge)."
I do not regret not having it published.
"Has been very successful, lots of publicity, and ..."
Q: don't you regret?
A: absolutely not.
"Q: does not earn much money, you don't have an actual team, you're not popular, sell little, why continue?"
"A: because my definition of success is different, our success is guaranteed because in Christ are blessed."
"Many colleagues have started at the same time our and have already given up, because they have earned as they wanted."
"Of course, I want to give the best to my family, but what about the great success, I believe that we have already."
"Because when we see God's hand at work, I am the first to be blessed and happy, I and my whole team."
Q:
So you believe that God will rejoice at what you are doing?
A:
Yes.
"Many times when I lose myself moods,"
"I know that God is happy to me, and therefore makes me feel its presence in continuation."
"Q: isn't always of great comfort, however your economic life, with your wife, but God there is always arguing."
Q:
"If one day you Strait lacked necessary, what would you do?"
"What would you think about the project ""harvest time"""
Rimangeresti you all?
A:
"No, absolutely not."
"Would not ever, because it is always a great joy to know that God is with me."
"We try to remain simpler as possible, we do not use branded clothing and other luxury items, since it would be so far from our reality."
"We don't need these things to have joy, we have the Lord and we are already super pleased."
"Look, I'm not preaching a false moralism, we are truly thankful for what God has given us!"
"And in the little things, like an outing at mcdonald 's, we're more than happy."
"Q: what message do you want to leave it to those who want to sell Christian books with only the intent to earn a lot of money, success and fame?"
A: do you want to earn money?
Go to sell chewing gum!
"Who or what do you aggrapperesti then in moments of crisis, eh?"
"I mean, that's -- that's definitely genetic modification."
Or any of the other funny-looking little dogs.
We also have transgenesis.
Transgenesis is really cool too.
That's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one.
That's how people make GloFish.
"You take a glow gene out of a coral or a jellyfish and you stick it in a zebrafish, and, puff, they glow."
And that's pretty cool.
And they obviously make a lot of money off of them.
And now they're making Glow-rabbits and Glow-all-sorts-of-things.
I guess we could make a glow chicken.
(Laughter)
But I don't think that'll satisfy the sixth-graders either.
But there's another thing.
There's what we call atavism activation.
And atavism activation is basically -- an atavism is an ancestral characteristic.
"You heard that occasionally children are born with tails, and it's because it's an ancestral characteristic."
And so there are a number of atavisms that can happen.
Snakes are occasionally born with legs.
And here's an example.
This is a chicken with teeth.
"A fellow by the name of Matthew Harris at the University of Wisconsin in Madison actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene for teeth, and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth in chickens."
Now that's a good characteristic.
We can save that one.
We know we can use that.
We can make a chicken with teeth.
That's getting closer.
That's better than a glowing chicken.
(Laughter)
"A friend of mine, a colleague of mine,"
"Dr. Hans Larsson at McGill University, is actually looking at atavisms."
"And he's looking at them by looking at the embryo genesis of birds and actually looking at how they develop, and he's interested in how birds actually lost their tail."
Those would be things like...
Our release engineer at the time had the keys to the server room where the Mozilla machines operated.
"These are small details but they were really important at the time and we knew that if he could do it he would help us keep Mozilla operating and we knew that Chofmann was running the engineering organisation and we knew that he would be helpful as it turned out, we needed him."
And Marcia had the keys to the closet that was our single supply of Mozilla t-shirts.
Which I bought with my own money.
"Oh, no."
"That was later, nevermind."
The ones I bought later.
But she had that key and she had access to some other things.
"So we would sit and think how many machines do we need, how many employees do we need."
"If we have one employee, is it Leef who runs the build machines?"
"If we have one employee, is it Brendan?"
Who is he?
And what's the best way to keep Mozilla operating?
But when it came to it I was the only one who was fired and so the rest of the Mozilla folks were left and Chofmann provided a haven for us to try and continue to be effective as well.
So this was this first era.
"So after I was fired there were a bunch of people still at Netscape, working on Netscape navigator."
As part of that we finally managed to ship our first product as Mozilla.
Mozilla 1.0 we called it.
And this had been a long time in coming.
That was in 2002.
We started Mozilla in 1998 and expected to have a product very shortly afterwards.
"But it turned out, when we got into it that the technology was pretty old."
Brendan made the decision to really build the new technology base.
That technology base is Gecko.
It cost us years to get the rendering engine to a point where we could really build a good application on it and ship it.
We finally did that in 2002.
It was Mozilla 1.0 and it was technically a good product.
It was technically a shockingly good product.
"Across the open source space, where people knew it they were retelling us they were really shocked to how good a product it was."
But it was not a consumer product.
"It was really built by developers, for developers."
"So, if you look at this graph."
This is how much health care is growing projected based upon the growth in the past and you can see sixteen percent in 27 going up in nearly 50 percent in 75 years.
Now we're not going to get the 50%.
We have a major crisis before we got there but you can see what impact the growth of Medicare and Medicaid are having.
Medicaid roughly and this is before healthcare reform.
But Medicare huge increase over that time and will get a wide that it is shortly 2009 and 2010.
Just one year.
"That's the year, the year for which we have the latest data that arise 300 billion, 200 billion, 100 billion, 50, billion, 25 billion."
"Now this is all health care spending, not just government."
"So, we got a tag 200 billion, 200 billion."
"You guys are a little more pessimistic, I already, I must have scared you, it's a 100 billion."
A 100 billion dollars change in one year.
"Now again, you are not used to thinking about billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars but a 100 billion dollars, that's how much it's costing us to expand health care to everyone."
Per year.
"So, if we could hold health, healthcare inflation and zero for one year, we could pay for the expansion in the healthcare system."
Think about $100 billion in almost any other context that you know of.
Right?
It's a huge amount of money.
"It's $300 for every woman, man, woman, and child in the United States."
We're talking about the payroll tax and all of that.
That's less than this level of inflation.
Benefit to a family of four of changing that payroll tax is less than just one year increased in health care cost.
"Here, you have from 1960, 147 this is for the per cap of spending so it's controlled for the growth and the population."
1968 was spending $147.
Now it is true this is nominal so.
"Up to, in 2009, $8000 per person."
"Again, a phenomenal and then if you look over the decade of the 2000s, you can see going from 5200 to 8000."
60 percent increase in spending.
This is the change in.
"Each decade comparing in the green bar, the growth in the GDP and the growth in the health care, NHE stands for National Health Expenditures, right?"
"First thing you can see is every year, every decade."
Healthcare expenditures exceed the growth and GDP.
To find out why Sarah Lee is suddenly tongue tied in class the school's resource teacher takes her to see speech and language specialist Donna
Orloff.
I'm going to read a sentence to you.
Orloff starts by testing Sarah Lee's basic language skills.
Look at some pictures and you can start up here at A.
"Lion, horse, mouse."
She has very good language for single words.
"She knows a lot of labels, a lot of nouns."
And she uses them and she understands them.
But there are other words that were associated-- not the direct label-- but associated with the pictures.
And that posed difficulty for her.
Perfect.
Point to swine.
So we get to swine.
She had no idea what swine is.
She's heard it.
She's heard it from reading Charlotte's Web.
But she doesn't have that rich storage system that enables her to tap the vocabulary and to retrieve the words that she needs.
"Our brains are basically a very complex storage and retrieval system where every piece of information that comes in to you, you put it someplace so that you can refer to it later on."
"If you see a Saint Bernard walking down the street, your retrieval system goes to your storage system, pulls out all of the note cards that it has on dogs, go through it until it finds Saint Bernard, and says, oh"
"look, there's a Saint Bernard."
All this happens in a millisecond.
And then you take that card and put it back where it belongs so when you need it next time you can find it.
The problem with these kids is that the storage and retrieval systems are very complicated and generally very confused.
So they will go and take the card out and then put it back in the wrong place.
"That ability to make mental connections, to go from one file drawer to the next also affects the way kids think abstractly."
"A student talking about a trip says, it's still up in the air."
Probably he's talking about a trip going around the world.
This is the child who only sees the picture of the pig is the pig.
The picture of the train is the train.
"If it's up in the air, he's got to be on an airplane."
"Language is never that one to one, rigid, concrete correlation."
You gotta miss me though
Let's turn his room into a gym
We ain't putting no gym in my media room.
Who's media room?
Our media room
"Okay, US health care cost."
"In 2010 which is the last year for which we have reliable data, we're two years behind on these data."
"We spent, the United States spent 2.6 trillion dollars on health care."
"Now, I have gone through lots and lots and"
lots and lots of places and talked about this spending and one of the things I have noticed is no matter where.
I go.
People have a very poor grasp of the word trillion.
And how big this number is.
So we have a few mechanisms to put this in context for you.
It's great for cocktail parties or frat parties or any place else you need to talk to someone and raise irrelevant topics and just show how smart you are so here is the first question for your audience response thing.
"If you convert health care spending, that 2.6 trillion dollars, how many years ago is 2.6 trillion seconds."
"40 percent said 80,000."
"Twenty, 100,000, 28%, you guys got it right."
"It's 80,000 years ago, 2.6 trillion."
Do you know how long ago that is?
"When was the first human that left the African continent, modern human that left the African continent to explore the rest of the world?"
"They didn't go out to explore, they went out looking for food that was 60,000 years ago."
This is before human being migrated out of the African continent and we're measuring this in seconds.
"So, how big is a trillion."
"Well, a million seconds [inaudible] actually it's about twelve days ago."
"One billion seconds is the year I graduated college, you guys can figure that out for yourself, okay? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; And it, there you go. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [laugh]. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I got to fix that slide."
"A trillion in seconds is 30,000 PC, 2.6 is around 80,000, alright?"
Just a huge number.
"Now, I know seconds is not what you think about and 80,000 years ago is a little too much at some ways."
"So, we're going to the moon."
"Single dollar bills, nice, crisp bills gotten right after the federal reserve and printed them, stacked up."
"You can see a 100 million crisp bills is pretty [inaudible], 6.8 miles. $One bills, right?"
The clocks are set at different times and moving at different speeds.
So the clocks are totally out of sync with each other and the child is generally out of sync with his environment.
"But the law of averages will tell you, if you take three clocks, set them at different times, and move them to different speeds, eventually-- bingo, bingo, bingo-- there will come a time when the three of them are all telling the same time."
"And when the clocks are in sync, there's this incredible forward movement on the part of the child-- for a day or week or a month if you're lucky, this incredible forward movement and progress."
And then the clocks get out of sync again.
The moment of truth called demystification.
You are like a wonderful car like a Mercedes or a Jaguar.
"But it has a very small gas tank so that when you try to think or do a lot of work, it runs out of fuel pretty easily."
"Demystification, I think, may be the most important movement in this field in the last 10 years."
And that is explaining to the child what the problem is.
"If you have a child with diabetes, one of the first things you do is explain to the child this is what diabetes is."
These are the foods you can eat.
This is what's happening to your body when you don't eat the proper food.
And explain line and verse.
"Yet when a child has a learning problem, we try to protect the child from it."
"I've had parents say to me, he doesn't know he has a learning problem."
"Indeed, he does."
"And sometimes a child takes great comfort in the diagnosis, in knowing"
I'm not the only person that has it.
I'm not stupid like the kids tell me in the school bus.
I'm not lazy like the teacher tells me every day.
There's really a name for this.
The second problem you have is what we call a graphomotor problem.
You don't have very good control over the very little muscles at the ends of your fingers.
And you know what you do because of that?
You try to get rid of them.
You know how you get rid of them?
By putting your thumb over these two fingers.
And you bear down real hard.
And you end up writing with your wrists.
And that's too slow.
And then you know what happens?
"They have free weights, they have machines."
The exercise machines are awesome.
I'm involved in the U.R.I. marching band.
I definitely love being at the football games and really channeling the school spirit.
You have the football team here.
The games are so much fun to go to.
Alot of students get into it.
We have a real close team.
The basketball is great.
My favorite sport is college basketball.
Lots of great rivalries.
You kind of just really get into it because everyones energy is high.
It really gives me that sense of school spirit.
I really feel like I've
learned alot and gotten alot of life lessons from all of the activities outside of my classes sometimes.
You're gonna gain a really great education.
"I think it's a really great option, especially financially."
They really focus on making sure that you get the bang for your buck.
I feel like I'm getting a good deal.
Get the most out of your college career because it goes by quick.
The education I'm getting here is great.
They prepare us well for the real world.
"Wow, I really have gotten alot out of the University."
I love U.R.I.
"For this question, we do a little recap of our packet protocol."
If we look at this wave form here you have the clock at the top.
"We have the valid signals that says, we are transmitting data."
"And then, the valid signal goes low the"
last cycle of the packet we are sending out a parity.
"In the second packet here, packet 2, you can see that while we're transmitting a packet, we can suspend that packet by asserting the suspensd signal."
"And therefore, the data transmissions will be delayed and the packet will not transmit until the suspensd signal goes again low."
This is a waveform.
This is very important.
"Every time I put up a problem and you're reading it, please recognize that this is an opportunity for you to learn the stuff by doing the problem first and then starting the video and doing it together with me."
"This is my main advice to you, take every opportunity to do the problems in the videos."
"So you have lot of testing, self-testing opportunities."
"Having said that, video is the main resource."
What do
I mean by that?
I am not going to give you Powerpoint versions of the video.
"To me,"
"Powerpoint is great, but it also makes you go to sleep."
"Online learning, has huge advantages."
"You can make your own class notes, and I encourage you to, from the video."
"But be an active listener, not lay sitting back having a coffee."
And you can do that too [laugh].
"You know, I am too."
Of course I can possibly watch.
"But I would encourage you to make, be an active participant in the video and hopefully if"
I am interesting enough right?
"But I will provide you very few notes, and these are"
largely geared towards stuff that you need to know at one place.
So two or three of these.
"Review of Statistics, some notes on how to use Excel or a Financial calculator, and some formulas put together to."
"But I must emphasis, don't go by the how to do things."
"First understand what the heck is going on, and why."
Another resource I'll give you is there are many textbooks written on Finance.
Finance took off in the late 50s.
"And for the next 30 years, there were a lot of really great breakthroughs."
And those breakthroughs from the fundamentals and great textbooks are available.
"And I'll give you some, I'll give you references."
"But there is one textbook which you may want to look at, which is free on the web, written by a colleague who allows you to read the stuff free not download."
And so on.
"So please when you use this textbook, don't try to download the stuff."
Or the way we went to describe that later: manifest destiny.
"Now, which would you rather be?"
"A grid, or manifest destiny?"
Manifest destiny.
(Laughter)
It's a big deal.
"It sounds big, it sounds important, it sounds solid."
It sounds American.
"Ballsy, serious, male."
And that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time.
"I mean, it goes on in our private lives, too, every single day."
"We all want to go out and buy an Audi TT, don't we?"
"Everyone here must own one, or at least they craved one the moment they saw one."
"And then they hopped in it, turned the little electronic key, rather than the real key, zipped home on their new superhighway, and drove straight into a garage that looks like a Tudor castle."
(Laughter)
Why?
Why?
Why do you want to do that?
Why do we all want to do that?
I even owned a Tudor thing once myself.
(Laughter)
"It's in our nature to go ricocheting back and forth between this technocratic solution and a larger, sort of more romantic image of where we are."
So we're going to go straight into this.
Can I have the lights off for a moment?
"I'm going to talk about two architects very, very briefly that represent the current split, architecturally, between these two traditions of a technocratic or technological solution and a romantic solution."
And these are two of the top architectural practices in the United States today.
"One very young, one a little more mature."
"This is the work of a firm called SHoP, and what you're seeing here, is their isometric drawings of what will be a large-scale camera obscura in a public park."
Does everybody know what a camera obscura is?
"Yeah, it's one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world -- it's sort of a little movie, without any moving parts -- and projects it on a page, and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it."
"This is just the outline of it, and you can see, does it look like a regular building?"
No.
"I feel the energy, the heart filled, I see all of your faces, really just brightening up."
We are going to end here and remind everyone to come back  to the basic practice.
Because I know we have been stimulated.
Don't let that pull you from who you are.
"I think we have touched that, the truth of who you are and your practice in the present moment."
"Don't let anything tempt you and lose that, even if it is about teaching  and education and all that."
"We just come back to our breath,  our steps, basic things that will..."
"Actually all the things that we need  are already in us and with the practice, we can trust that."
"With the mother and... as parents too, the teenagers."
I work with a lot of teens and the mindfulness has helped me a lot to really call out what it is that is really happening in present moment.
You only can do that calmly  if you've done your own homework.
So there is nothing that  you cannot solve or deal with.
"Mindfulness is just an energy, is not a technique, an energy we can cultivate."
"Just in present moment, you can recognize and call out to the teenagers to the students, what it is, what is happening."
"But calmly, with a lot of love  and compassion, miracles happen."
We all have experienced that  wherever arena we are in.
"So that encourages you for the next hour, or as we eat lunch."
"Don't think about this,  let it go."
"Come back to your steps, come back to your dinner."
"What it is that you are looking for, it is already in there."
"I think we all know that already, that's why we're here,to actually cultivate that."
"So we learn the teaching mind,  a teacher's mind which is... more things, more pieces of paper."
"We just let go, come back."
"So, we'll end here  with three sounds of the bell for us to really enjoy this moment and to let this happiness and what we touched here for the sharings, giving us a lot of energy."
"We let that dissipate  into all the teachers, all the students, all the young ones, all the parents  out there, all doing their best."
(Half bell)

May we end here?
Can I teach you a song?
"I'll sing the first line, okay?"
"For example, I can do something,"
I can cut my hair short to minimize my shampoo consumption.
"I can reduce my footprint by, for example, taking the elevator."
"Because when you take the elevator, you can be five time less bad"
"Because it takes, for a vegetarian, five times more energy to lift somebody by taking the stairs, than taking the elevator."
"In calories, it's five times more energy intensive than taking the elevator."
"So, whenever you want to protect the environment, take the elevator, because it takes so much less energy when you have an elevator, because you use calories so much."
"We can do a lot, for example, never drink sparkling water."
Because it's three litres of carbon dioxides.
"We can do a lot; we call it ""sustainability""."
"When I ask you, ""How is your relationship with your girlfriend?"
What would you say?
Sustainable.
(Laughter)
"Then, I am really sorry for you."
(Laughter)
"So, this is not about minimizing being bad; it's about being good."
We talk about reducing carbon dioxide emissions; but two thirds of all the carbon is in soil?
"Not in oil, not in coal, two thirds of all the carbon is in top soil."
"So, we want to be carbon neutral, but why don't we make a footprint which is beneficial, instead of carbon neutral?"
"People try to be ""less bad""."
"You will say, ""Oh yes! 'm 90% bad, 80% bad,"
"I make all zeroes carbon neutral""."
"For example, Europe has a goal to be carbon neutral in 2050."
You can only be carbon neutral when you don't exist.
This is the only way.
"Just by thinking, you are not carbon neutral."
"So how could you say, ""My biggest goal is to be carbon neutral?"""
"Out of all the environmental disasters,"
"- Seveso, Bhopal, The Love Canal, Chernobyl - the generated feeling is, ""it's better we're not here""."
"And when you are in, say, Amazon, we think, ""We are a pain for the planet""."
This is why we try to be less bad.
I need super computers.
"So, what does Google do here?"
What does--why do we do this?
"Well, partly, at the end of the day, it's paradoxical."
We want to give people time back.
We want them to get you to an answer quickly.
"We want you to be more productive so that you can get back and give us the things that, that--the things that you enjoy, which"
I would argue or relay around people in society and culture and the things that all of us appreciate so much.
"So in our case, a new definition of Google would have--we're trying very hard to get you something fast."
"Never underestimate the importance of fast, quick, quick, quick."
We want it there.
We want it now.
We want to help you right now.
Speed matters because your time matters.
We make hundreds of improvements to search every year.
You see them gradually all over and over again.
The accuracy gets better.
The index gets much bigger.
You'll see some of the facilities in a sec now that we've done around translation and other kinds of annotation.
"We have one of the largest infrastructures now which we just introduced, which is internally known as Caffeine, which basically allow us to handle even greater, greater indexes and many more information."
"Now, what are we going to do with search?"
"Ultimately, search is a personal activity."
"So, ultimately, where search goes is it searches not just the web, but literally all of your information, your email--the things that you care about."
"This is with your permission, I might add."
"This is personal search for you and only you because ultimately, search is about finding what you want right now."
"And the next step of search, of course, is doing this automatically."
"So when I walk down the street of Berlin, I love history, what I want is I want the computer--my smartphone to be doing searches constantly."
Did you know?
Did you know?
Did you know?
Did you know?
This occurred here.
"Preached in many churches can say, but only on the outskirts of Fortaleza."
"Probably the major ministries do not know me, to tell the truth I am alone, like a drop in the middle of the desert."
"I'm just a man who does what he believes God has put in my heart, and I do not care about what others say."
"I don't care that God knows my heart, this is the most important thing."
Q: the big ministries missionaries know Gap?
A:
"No, I think not, I can't guarantee it."
Sometimes we try to establish contacts but ...
"Q: can't you feel kinda saddened because nobody pays you for what you do, for your sacrifices?"
A:
No.
Q: why don't we have been called to become famous.
The word says that we cannot be more than our master.
One of the things that most are horrified me is this idea of the Ministry set up blindly ...
"Watch, the helmsman's not you ..."
But the rower!
What obeys.
"Are not entered in the missions looking for earnings, but conscious of the sacrifices."
Got It?
"Usually we say that no one can be sure to be a servant of God if he has not first explored the depths of the disenchantment of oneself and the world, because the treasures that gives the world not a blessing but a priming."
There is one thing that happens sometimes ...
"God gave us the grace to spread the word about Gap for Fortaleza, but few have heard of me."
I see it as a gift in many ways because there is something in us that ...
It is difficult to explain.
The Bible doesn't say that to get something from Christ we need to deal with him.
It is he who tells us what is our call.
We trust in him then!
"There is a phrase that says ""join in the boat with God and return to port with him."" In short, don't you dare even to start without him, we do ours that ""dying"" expressed by Christ on the cross, dying to our dreams, and everything that we thought they needed ..."
I wish to remain clear that God has never abused my will.
"It was always patient, as in fix I've often complained."
"But I felt in these 12 years as say the Scriptures, that his goodness is perfect and good, I only had to align my heart closer to Her to figure it out."
"I don't know where I will go, whether I'll live a humble life."
"So, let's take the extreme case scenario, you are doing a regular job and you know 40 years from now, you are going to retire."
"My point there is, you have more control on that, but sometimes people don't."
People have jobs where they are dependent on their employer on how many years they work?
"But forgiven, I mean you won't go to a financial advisor and say, how many years do I retire?"
"The person will give you an answer but [laugh] , you know, will charge you a lot money for giving the answer, right?"
"So the 40 is also information that you should know, 10,000 is the information you should know and now the eight%."
I'm going to violate the assumption that I said make at the back of your mind.
"But to be fair, I never said assume is not there."
"I said, I know it's there, keep it in the back of your mind, but for convenience's sake, ignore it."
And that is risk.
"So, let me ask you this, who determines the eight%?"
"And if you can answer that, you have arrived."
And the answer is simply nobody.
"If, if anybody knew what the interest rate was in the future for the next 40 years or something, you know, they would, they would be omnipresent."
They would know the future.
We are wanting to be like that.
But I think the beauty of
life is nobody knows.
"And in fact, one of the most profound developments in Finance in recent years, I, I should recent say last 40, 50 years that gets challenged because it's a good idea."
"Bad ideas don't get challenged, right?"
Good ideas get challenged.
"So, the notion there is that nobody in a good market should be able to tell the future because everything we know is already in the marketplace, right?"
That's why I said competitive markets at the beginning are extremely important to what we do.
"So, quick question."
Who determines the eight%?.
And the answer is you.
And this is where I have to bring in risk a little bit.
Why?
"Because eight percent let me tell you, if you get over the next 40 years, may the force be with you."
[laugh].
Because it is not going to be easy.
"You have to take risks to get high rates of return, and with risk comes volatility."
You're violating copyright.
I also encourage you to look at the other textbooks and don't worry about which edition it is.
The fundamentals are the same.
"So choose a reference for yourself, but please recognize I'm not following any specific textbook, page by page."
"If I were, this class wouldn't be very useful you know."
So I am doing the
"Essence of Finance at an introductory level, but you need to have some references and there are several options."
So make a choice soon.
Finally the material that is kind of come second in importance to the videos is all the assignments and I've talked enough about them.
But I would encourage you again to do the assignments.
Try them even before looking at the video.
"You k now, that's a, that's a kind of a challenge to try to understand what's going on."
Test yourself all the time.
"I'm going to now, talking about this thing, I'm going to move over to how do we evaluate."
Why are we evaluating you?
"Because we will give you a certificate, and the certificate has to have some criteria, right?"
I'm not a big fan of grading.
"In fact, I feel that's the least enjoyable part of my life, and partly because it's kind of boring, but also because who am I, You know."
"I mean you are learning, you should be able to grade yourself, and so on."
But the world is complex so lets talk about evaluation for a second.
"It'll be pass, fail."
So how do I determine pass or fail?
"You'll get a certificate if you pass, you will not get a certificate."
So my grading philosophy is very simple.
"It's not mine, it's borrowed from my reading of grading in particular."
"And basically the notion here is, do you know enough?"
Rather than do you get 100%.
So in each assignment.
You have to get 70%.
"If you don't get 70 percent on any one assignment, you cannot get a certificate."
"Similarly you have to get 70 percent on the final, which is in the last week."
"You don't have an assignment in the last week, but you have a final."
"I'm on the, on the, on the course forums or in whatever social media hangouts you're using."
"And, if you haven't joined a group yet to work with and discuss the questions with,"
I strongly advise you to do that.
The only one I want to look up from
Assignment one is question eight because this one has a little bit of mathematics in it.
It relates to that proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers.
And you'll recall from a lecture that a key part of that was taking this number N that you get by multiplying the first
little n primes together and adding one.
"And at the time, I actually mentioned that this number is not always prime, well, how do you prove that?"
"Well, you prove it by exhibiting a sequence of prime numbers for which it's not prime."
"So, you start by looking at the primes and you sort of say, well, two x three + one, in that case, you get seven."
Then seven is a prime.
"So, let's go one more, two x three x five + one, you get 31."
That's also a prime.
"Well, let's do another one, two x three x5 x seven + one, that's 211."
That's also a prime.
"Well, at this point, you might beginning to lose heart, but if you keep going just a couple more until you get two x three x five x seven x eleven x thirteen + one, then in that case you get 30,031, which is equal to 59 x 509, which is not prime."
"And so now, we've exhibited a number of this form."
Let me put parenthesis in here.
Just to separate things out.
Oops.
"You don't actually need them, because of the conventions that multiplication dominates over addition."
But let's put them in anyway.
"And in this case you check one, two, three, four, five, the first six primes, add one, you get a composite number."
"That shows that this number is not always prime, okay?"
And that takes care of assignment one.
First we'll deal with the controversial bit.
This car belongs to Ferrari.
And I'm probably not supposed to be driving it.
But I'm not going to dwell on that.
"Someone kind of subcontracted it to me, let's say."
I am doing my best.
Please don't be long.
Your absence makes it even more unbearable.
- I'll be on my way soon.
- When is your flight?
"Okay, dear."
See you tomorrow.
"- I love you, my love."
- Me too.
I love you too.
Your grandma is saying hello.
- Vural?
- I've heard.
Thank you.
They won't rob our truck I hope.
He said the park is open 7/24.
"It not only has audio, video and images, but for the first time, it's a broadcasting medium that can except a whole lot of text."
"So, there's a whole lot of stuff typically going on at once."
Its also a great interruption system.
"It's feeding us messages, alerts, our access notices, tweets, Facebook updates all the time and again that's one of its powers as a medium, but it's also very distracting."
"And finally, and due to many of those, its encouraging a constant multitasking, constant juggling of visual stimuli as well as actual jobs."
So I think it's all those things combined.
PETER NORVlG:
"Now one of things that stuck me, you cite Maryanne Wolfe, whose an expert in this area, and she says 'the web returns us to the time of scritura continua', which is like the Latin script where there are no spaces in between words and supposedly its an additional cognitive task to be able to separate that out into spaces and so deciding not to click on a link is this additional cognitive blow."
"Now ironically, that paragraph had a footnote at the end of it."
And looking up that footnote took me about twenty to thirty times longer than it would've taken if I would've had that book online and really got me out of the flow and I got really distracted.
(Laughter)
"And I also wanted to say that from what I know of the task of word segmentation, it's really not that difficult."
That Chinese and Japanese don't have spaces between words; they have no problem doing that.
I have a little example from my text book where I have a ten line program that does word segmentation with ninety percent accuracy.
So that not really so bad and maybe hyperlinks are so bad either.
"And maybe, its that we have to train ourselves that"
How much commercial relationship do we have?
There's the point of maintaining our values and doing things in a way that represents our values and be where people are.
There's often no easy answer.
In the past we had voted we will go where people are.
That's how we have impact.
We could be an open source project.
We were a very successful open source project in 1999 where we had thousands of people already contributing to Mozilla.
We were irrelevant to the marketplace.
We were irrelevant to consumers' lives and irrelevant to citizen's lives.
And we changed that with Firefox by consciously deciding to go where people are.
"We even did a commercial relationship with Google and Yahoo, which of course turned out after the fact to be what sustains us going forward."
But we did those commercial relationships because we wanted their searchs and we thought that they would be good.
"Now, after the fact, it turns out they generated the money that allows us to grow."
So sustainability is also an important piece.
How do you build those relationships in a way that have Mozilla values in them?
We've done that before and we'll continue to do that.
And now I'm trying to think about...
Do we wanna have questions?
Has everybody asked the questions they have?
I can keep talking or we can go on to questions.
"I do wanna close at the end, but go ahead."
[Question]
So we knew that... so we shipped Firefox 4...
"Firefox 1, in November 2004 and we had a goal of, I don't know, 10 million downloads in 30 days, which we past in 10 days."
So we knew by December that the amount of money we would be getting was beyond our expectations.
We didn't know how far it would go.
"So we had been hoping to be able to generate enough revenue to sustain those 10 people, or 12 people."
"At the time, we didn't even know how to sustain those."
"By January 1st, we knew that we would be able to do that."
The response to Firefox 1 was sort of the stuff of dreams.
"Now, it turns out, those were also stressful times."
What happened?
We discovered it last year at WOWODC.
It's basically telling Oracle to work in the 8I mode.
You lose all your 10G features.
"OK, next one I'll go through pretty quickly."
"Awake from insertion, it's the EO constructor."
If any of you have ever tried to use the actual Java constructer in your enterprise objects you probably quickly discovered that wasn't really a good thing to do.
"If you want to do your initialization in awakeFromlnsertion, it's the place to set defaults for your enterprise objects."
The little known fact that I want to point out today is that it can get called more than once.
"Two cases have been pointed out recently, Java client and nested editing context can result in this getting called more than once."
In order to protect yourself the best practice is to check to make sure a value is null before you set the default.
"If not, then probably something else has been done with that object and you don't want to go back to the default."
- There is also the init method you can override if you're using Wonder which checks whether it's a temporary global ID or not.
If you deleted an object from an editing context and do an undo on the editing context it gets reinserted.
"- Oh, that's another good point, yeah."
- You want to set up the default values there.
Use in it or check whether the global id is a temporary global ID or a non temporary.
"- OK, now a few quick Java ones, exception handling."
Don't do this.
How many times have I seen code...
I thought somebody would like that.
Don't write code like that.
Just don't do it.
"I've seen so many people do that and it's just,"
"""Oh, it will never happen."
"Don't worry about it."""
"Sooner or later, yeah, it does happen."
- What if you expect it and it won't hurt?
- Whatever you want to do in the privacy of your own application is fine with me.
- He's right.
That does occasionally happen.
"For me when that happens I always put a comment in that catch, and explain why I'm doing that."
Because someone is going to come back behind you and wonder... they'll think you're a bad programmer.
These URLs are eligible for the feature because they come in key value pairs or name value pairs.
"What it looks like is ""key equals value"" and then perhaps an ampersand."
"And then ""key two equals value two."" And Google, when we see these parameters will treat this URL as equivalent to this URL."
Because the ordering in the parameters doesn't matter.
URLs that are ineligible for this feature are those that don't use the key value configuration.
So if a site uses a bunch of plus signs to separate their parameters.
Or they just use a directory structure.
Or they use their own type of encoding.
None of these types of URLs can actually be used.
Because this feature requires the name value pairs.
Alright.
I know that was a long intro.
But now let's get started with the feature.
Step one is to specify parameters that don't change the page's content.
"So you can ask yourself,"
"""Do I have parameters that don't affect page content?"" Things like a session ID."
An affiliate
ID.
Or a tracking ID.
These types of parameters don't change page content.
"And so in the feature, you can actually mark them as ""does not change content."" And once you've said that, Webmaster"
Tools will put one representative URL as the setting.
And then Googlebot will act accordingly.
"Once step one is completed for all the parameters that don't actually change page-content, then"
let's move on to step two.
Which comes in two parts.
The first part is to specify the parameters that change page content.
So you'll select.
"""Yes, this changes, reorders, or ""narrows"" page content."" And then you can have a type of page content effect."
"Whether that sorts,"
"""narrows"", specifies, etcetera."
And we'll cover more of this in depth.
So you've essentially gone from hundreds of channels in your TV line-up to millions of channels just with the implementation of a browser.
How do you search all of this content?
"Well, we thought of that, too."
"So I'm going to bring down the search box again, and from here I can type in the name of a channel and"
I could see that right now this is a show that's playing.
"With one click, I tune there and I'm done."
People don't have as much time as they used to.
We want to get them there quicker.
"But the search box is interesting not just for channel searches, but we can search for anything."
Let me search for Star Trek.
You'll see here that we're integrating
TV search as well as pages from the web.
I can even search TV and video content and this takes me to a page where I can access all the content about Star Trek that I ever want to watch.
I can browse movies.
"I can go to specific shows, specific episodes, and even clips from the web."
"Now, it doesn't matter what's on right now."
What matters is what do I want to watch?
Google TV lets me watch it.
And this is--some of this is free and some of this is paid.
We're doing integrations with different video on demand providers to allow users to pay for things instantly and watch them immediately on their TV.
"So now you have all your TV, you have all of the web, and you have a way to search it all."
It gets even better.
I'm going to go to my home screen really quickly and navigate to one of my recordings for Top Gear.
"Now, this specific episode of Top Gear is all about the Ferrari."
And let's just say for a minute that I was so captivated by this show that
I wanted to buy a Ferrari.
Check this out.
"With one button, I can collapse the screen into a smaller screen size and I do a search for a ""buy a Ferrari""."
"Granted, this is just a demo, I'm not really going to buy one today."
"Now, I can go online and do that just now."
"Now, you can imagine all of the use cases where this can be very compelling."
I'm watching a breaking news story and I want to go see what people are saying on Twitter or Facebook or I'm watching a game show like Jeopardy and I want to go cheat and get the answer before the people on TV do.
The suitors are doing all the wrong things when it comes to xenia.
"When they cross this threshold and act so ugly, in such an ugly way to Odysseus."
"Yeah, they're, they're treating a beggar poorly, and they should have treated a beggar better."
But they're also running afoul of this critical code that is built into what it is to be Greek.
You ought to treat strangers well.
"So, it's not just that you're doing something that's a little bit rude to this one person, you're violating a core social custom of what it is to be a Greek."
So these suitors are violating something quite strong here and being quite so rude to Odysseus.
"Also, they are violating a code that is a strong, strongly knitted into the Greek cultural fabric."
But it also comes from Zeus himself.
So they are committing a kind of offense against Zeus by not treating a stranger well.
And this comes out.
Gods arrive and disguised in every way.
We hear again at page 370.
Gods arrive disguised in every way.
That person who you don't who it is could be god.
You should treat them well.
"And if you don't, you are violating even the great authority of Zeus."
"Looking forward to book twenty, one of the suitors comes up and says, you want a guest gift, you beggar?"
"Fine, I'll give you guest gift."
"And takes an ox hoof and he hurls it, hurls it at Odysseus."
Further perversion of the custom of the xenia.
"What you are supposed to do is not take the hoof which can be used as a weapon, but take the meat which is nourishing."
"Give it to somebody who comes to your house, take care of them but they're not doing that."
"As this book, you know, carries forward book seventeen."
We see further Eumaeus develop in his role as messenger.
He brings a message from the stranger to Penelope at 371.
"Then comes back and, and talks to Odysseus and Odysseus asks then Eumaeus to bring a message back to Penelope."
"That message of Penelope, hey, stranger who has just washed into my house."
I'm so far away from my husband.
Maybe you'd like to have a private audience with me?
And invites him to go ahead and come on in and talk to her.
"Already a little bit forward, that maneuver."
That's what I think the drawing implies.
"They say the inside of a rectangular carton is 48 centimeters long, 32 centimeters wide and 15 centimeters high"
OK.
So that's the inside.
Kind of from the other wall.
This is the floor of the inside of the container and then there would be another up here.
But I think you get the idea.
The carton is filled to capacity with k identical cylindrical cans of fruit that stand upright in rows and columns as indicated in the figure above.
OK.
So this is like a top view of it.
"So we could say that this side up here, this is 48 and then this is 32."
"So we don't care so much about the height, I think."
"So, let's see, the carton is filled to capacity with k identical cylindrical cans of fruit that stand upright in rows and columns as indicated in figure above."
If the cans are 15 centimeters high--
"OK, so each of the cans are exactly 15 centimeters high."
So they literally are exactly as high as the carton.
"If the cans are 15 centimeters high, what is the value of k?"
So we have to figure out how many of these cans will fit in this area essentially?
And then they tell us point number one: each of the cans have a radius of 4 centimeters.
Radius is 4 centimeters.
"Well, if we know that each of them have a radius of 4 centimeters then we know exactly how much square area each of these circles will take up, assuming that they're packed exactly like this, right?"
"Because if you think about it, what is this area right here?"
"Well, there's a bunch of were different ways you could think about it."
"The easiest is that if the radius is 4 centimeters, that the diameter right here is 8 centimeters."
"So if this is 8 and you have a 48 length, you can only do 6 of these, right?"
6 times 8 is 48.
So you can only do 6 that way.
"And then if the diameter is 8 this way and this length is 32, you can only do 4 this way."
"So statement number one, alone, is enough to figure out how many you can put."
It would actually be 4 times 6.
"You could put 24, k would be 24 cans that you could fit in."
"So statement one, alone, is enough."
"So, it looks like this."
"The story can be told in multiple ways, but in English we have a phrase, ""What goes around, comes around."""
"On the religious side, there's the golden rule, ""Do onto others..."""
"And the story we heard earlier on the Polish farm, basically internalizing in economic systems, what is otherwise thrown away,"
literally makes certain or ensures that the resources that we have are reinvested in our present and our future.
"You wear, as I do, the same phosphate molecules that were in Socrates, that were in Copernicus, that were in Tyrannosaurus Rex."
"We're breathing the same carbon dioxide, the carbon cycles unrestfully pass through us."
"And we either reinvest the carbon in the landscape, we reinvest the resources, or they are gone."
Here's my sampling 100 points.
I'm going to turn off the light just to highlight this.
I want to highlight some regions here.
"Look I've got some sampling here, notice in here, I don't sample at all."
"Do you think I'm going to be able to get signal in there, because you don't want to go by Shawn's theory."
Shawn said.
"There is no way you have any business making a statement about what's going on in that, right?"
"You got no information there, how are you going to get frequency content when you've not sampled the ups and downs?"
"Oh, look at this region over there!"
"I got a huge stretch, 1.2 and I got all this stuff going on Okay?"
Nyquist would say you're screwed.
You're done.
"Like, why, what are thinking about?"
Like seriously?
Drop math now.
"Compress sensing would say wait a minute, but you told me that this is sparse signal."
Which means I have a constraint on the number of freq uencies that might be active which means.
I might be able to get it.
And I'm going to try to get it that optimizes the fit to what I have with a small number of frequencies that are consistent with the data I have.
"You get it, okay?"
"Actually, in this case you're, you're right at the edge of reconstruction, okay?"
"But still, it's we'll, we'll come back to this."
"It's pretty impressive, still, what you can kind of."
"Get out of this, piece."
lignified carbon sequestration fertilization.
And if every farm in America practiced that we would sequester all the carbon that's been emitted since the beginning of the industrial age in fewer than 10 years.
Wow!
That's how efficacious it is.
"So when you eat your grass finished steak, not only is it good for you, it's good for the whole ecology."
"Is there also a movement in the beef raising industry towards this, because of the increasing demand?"
"Yes, and this is probably growing faster than the pastured poultry, the pastured pork."
Beef is probably growing faster.
"I don't know why, except that probably the beef industry has not been vertically integrated"
like the swine and the poultry industry.
There are still a lot of independent operators out there.
"Whereas the swine and the poultry industry have been, you know, Tyson's and Smithfield, they've vertically integrated it."
"So there's a lot more ability to be creative and move in the beef industry, and for sure there's a tremendous increase."
"And to increase the awareness, what should consumers look for?"
Should they look for grass finished?
Or is that term being bastardized too?
"Well, what they should do is go visit the farm and see."
But many people aren't going to do that.
"Well, they should."
"So that's the first step, visit the farm."
"Yes, visit the farm, see if there's any grain around and ask the farmer, ask around."
"But mainly, visit the farm and see if you see any grain."
"Cause most farmers will say, yeah, they're grass finished but we grain them the last 30 days."
It's more common than not.
"If you hear those terms, that is the cue to find a new farmer."
"That's exactly right, that is the cue."
"The question is, have they ever gotten any grain in their lives?"
Period.
"If the answer is yes, then find a new one."
"I mean, you know, not that there might not be a, for example, we buy a lot of calves."
"We don't know, some of these calves probably got a little bit of grain maybe when they were weaned from the cow, for a week of two."
"But that's way, way back, 12 months ago."
We just showed that at least one player can gain by changing strategy holding others constant.
The same would be true if we went the other way around.
"If we held B constant at 25, A could gain by changing his strategy, could go right over there."
This is not a Nash equilibrium.
"Then regardless of what state we go to, if we go to this state, it's still not a Nash Equilibrium."
"If we hold A constant,"
"B could improve by increasing his production; or if we hold B constant, then A can still improve by cheating even more."
None of these are Nash equilibriums.
"From any one of these states, if you hold A constant,"
"B could produce more; or if you hold B constant,"
A could produce more and get some gain.
"Over here, A's going from 130 to 160 and getting some gain."
You can imagine this keeps happening incrementally.
They keep producing more and more and more.
"We kind of go there, then we go there, then maybe we go there, then we go there."
"Then maybe A cheats some more, then B cheats some more, then A cheats a little bit more,"
"B cheats a little bit more, maybe a little bit more past that, then A cheats a little bit more."
"The whole time the whole economic profit pie, which is the sum of A and B, is getting smaller and smaller until finally A finally cheats and they're at zero economic profit."
Now let's think about whether this is a Nash equilibrium.
"Clearly, they won't want to move backwards."
"If you hold A constant,"
B would not want to move down.
Then he would
lose economic profit.
That doesn't work.
He doesn't gain by doing that.
"If you hold B constant, A wouldn't want to move to the right."
A would also lose economic profit.
Now you might say what if they produced beyond 37.5?
Why can't they keep producing and go beyond there?
"Holding A constant, if B were to produce more than 37.5 from this state right over here, then the total pie will get negative and it doesn't matter if B's getting a larger or smaller chunk of that pie."
B's chunk is going to be negative.
"He's also interested in the transformation of the arm, the hand, to the wing."
He's looking for those genes as well.
"And I said, ""Well, if you can find those,"
"I can just reverse them and make what I need to make for the sixth-graders."""
And so he agreed.
And so that's what we're looking into.
"If you look at dinosaur hands, a velociraptor has that cool-looking hand with the claws on it."
"Archaeopteryx, which is a bird, a primitive bird, still has that very primitive hand."
"But as you can see, the pigeon, or a chicken or anything else, another bird, has kind of a weird-looking hand, because the hand is a wing."
"But the cool thing is that, if you look in the embryo, as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand."
"It has the three fingers, the three digits."
But a gene turns on that actually fuses those together.
And so what we're looking for is that gene.
"We want to stop that gene from turning on, fusing those hands together, so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand,"
like the archaeopteryx.
And the same goes for the tails.
Birds have basically rudimentary tails.
"And so we know that in embryo, as the animal is developing, it actually has a relatively long tail."
"But a gene turns on and resorbs the tail, gets rid of it."
So that's the other gene we're looking for.
We want to stop that tail from resorbing.
"So what we're trying to do really is take our chicken, modify it and make the chickenosaurus."
(Laughter)
It's a cooler-looking chicken.
But it's just the very basics.
So that really is what we're doing.
"And people always say, ""Why do that?"
Why make this thing?
"What good is it?"""
"Well, that's a good question."
"Actually, I think it's a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things."
"And quite frankly, I think if Colonel Sanders was to be careful how he worded it, he could actually advertise an extra piece."
"I used to spend a lot of time on commercial fishing boats, and I remember fishermen saying they can tell when a basking shark has been caught in a net, because it leaves a black slime behind."
So that must have come from the shark.
"Now, we had an interest in getting tissue samples for genetics because we knew they were very valuable."
We would use conventional methods;
"I have a crossbow -- you see it in my hand there, which we use to sample whales and dolphins for genetic studies as well."
"So I tried that, I tried many techniques."
"All it was doing was breaking my arrows, because the shark's skin is just so strong."
There was no way we were going to get a sample from that.
That wasn't going to work.
"So when I saw the black slime on the bow of the boat,"
"I thought, ""If you take what you're given in this world ..."""
So I scraped it off.
I had a little tube with alcohol in it to send to the geneticists.
"So I scraped the slime off and sent it to Aberdeen, and said, ""You might try that."""
And they sat on it for months.
It was only because we had a conference on the Isle of Man.
"But I kept emailing Les, saying,"
"""Have you had a chance to look at my slime?"""
"And he was like, ""Yeah, yeah."
"Later."""
He thought he'd better do it because I never met him before; he might lose face if he hadn't done the thing I sent him.
And he was amazed that they actually got DNA from the slime.
"They amplified it and they tested it, and they found, yes, this was actually basking shark DNA, which was got from the slime."
So he was very excited.
"It became known as ""Simon's shark slime."""
"And I thought, ""Hey, you know, I can build on this."""
"So we thought, OK, we're going to try to get out and get some slime."
So having spent three-and-a-half thousand on satellite tags ...
"I then thought I'd invest 7.95 -- the price is still on it -- in my local hardware store in Kilrush for a mop handle, and even less money on some oven cleaners."
And I wrapped the oven cleaner around the edge of the mop handle and ... (Laughter)
I was desperate to have an opportunity to get some sharks.
"And this was into August now, and normally sharks peak in June, July, and you rarely see them, or rarely can be in the right place to find sharks into August."
"We was at the Leoncito, working for my dad, and then we started riding horses, probably when I was 5 or 6 years old -- getting on some horses by ourselves, and my brother and I would go to the corral and rope the milk cow's calves and ride them."
Put the rope on and ride them.
We wanted to be cowboys.
The skills Charlie was acquiring to manage cattle and horses would later help him to compete in rodeos.
"When we were marking lambs, he used to tell us"
"leave 10 or 12 lambs outside, and talk about fun"
"I had for Welsh horses, and they were good."
"They'd just follow a lamb like a dog, you know."
"And we had those little maguey ropes and we used to rope them, and put one lamb in front of your saddle and rope another one, and then get two and take them to the corral and then go rope some more."
Rodeo is a Spanish word that referred to the semi-annual roundup of cattle borne from the Mexican ranching tradition.
I must have been 16-17 the first time I went on the roundup.
When they started the roundup they would call to see who was going to go.
They would come to town and ask you if you wanted to go to the roundup for 40-45 days.
"If you said yes, they would tell you what day they would pick you up."
"So you had to roll your bat, and have it ready."
"And your saddle, and they would come in the truck and pick you up."
"By the time we got gathered and getting close to where the camp was going to be the cook had lunch for us, coffee."
We changed horses to start sorting.
You always kept the best horses to sort cattle because you always used the best horses for the cutting.
You ride the broncs in the morning.
My uncle says that on the 06 ranch you could ride on horseback from dawn to dusk and never see a fence.
He started working in the first grade to help support the family and had dreams of buying the perfect horse to take him to the main event.
He learned quickly that if he didn't have a good horse there was no use in showing up.
They had this rodeo in Fort Davis.
There were college boys and I'm working on ranches.
We used to rope a lot of baby calves.
"I had the rope in my hand and this guy who used to go to Sul Ross, he says what are you going to do with that rope, Charlie?"
So I told him...I says
I'm going to beat you guys in the calf roping tomorrow.
This other guy had a nice calf horse and I used him.
So I went out there and roped this brahma calf and I went out there and flanked him and tied him.
And won the calf roping... with that raggedy rope.
"So we went back to these specimens and we started digging around, and particularly, we looked into the teeth of skulls, hard parts where humans had not been able to get their fingers, and we found much better quality DNA."
We found nuclear mitochondrial genes.
It's there.
So we got it.
OK.
What could we do with this stuff?
"Well, George Church, in his book, ""Regenesis,"" has mentioned many of the techniques that are rapidly advancing to work with fragmented DNA."
"We would hope that we'll be able to get that DNA back into a viable form, and then, much like we've done with the Lazarus Project, get that stuff into an egg of a host species."
It has to be a different species.
What could it be?
Why couldn't it be a Tasmanian devil?
"They're related, distantly, to thylacines."
And then the Tasmanian devil is going to pop a thylacine out the south end.
"Critics of this project say, hang on."
"Thylacine, Tasmanian devil?"
That's going to hurt.
"No, it's not."
These are marsupials.
They give birth to babies that are the size of a jelly bean.
That Tasmanian devil's not even going to know it gave birth.
"It is, shortly, going to think it's got the ugliest Tasmanian devil baby in the world, so maybe it'll need some help to keep it going."
Andrew Pask and his colleagues have demonstrated this might not be a waste of time.
"And it's sort of in the future, we haven't got there yet, but it's the kind of thing we want to think about."
"They took some of this same pickled thylacine DNA and they spliced it into a mouse genome, but they put a tag on it so that anything that this thylacine DNA produced would appear blue-green in the mouse baby."
"In other words, if thylacine tissues were being produced by the thylacine DNA, it would be able to be recognized."
"When the baby popped up, it was filled with blue-green tissues."
"And that tells us if we can get that genome back together, get it into a live cell, it's going to produce thylacine stuff."
Is this a risk?
You've taken the bits of one animal and you've mixed them into the cell of a different kind of an animal.
Are we going to get a Frankenstein?
Some kind of weird hybrid chimera?
And the answer is no.
The letting go one is the hardest one for people to understand because they don't know what they're supposed to let go off.
"It's not letting go of the grief, it's letting go of the person that doesn't want the grief."
It's letting go of the controlling.
"Because sometimes when people have grief, disappointment, broken heart, anger, fear, when we try and do letting go we think letting go means destroying those emotions."
That's disrespect to those emotions.
"Instead, we let go of that person inside who's trying to do something about this, the controller, the one who says ""I don't want these emotions, I have to get rid of them""."
That's the thing we have to let go of.
The control-freak.
"So if you have those emotions inside of you and you try to suppress them, get rid of them, destroy them, of course what happens - they get worse."
"If you're fed up and you say ""I shouldn't be fed up"", that's what we call being fed up about being fed up."
[laughter].
We have something called suffering - the word for suffering in Buddhism is dukkha.
We call such things double-dukkha.
It's like I'm angry
"- ""I shouldn't be angry!"
"I'm a monk!""."
You're getting angry at being angry.
"You're depressed, and I'm fed up with being.., I don't want to be depressed anymore!"
You're being depressed about being depressed!
Or you're afraid of fear.
Those are called double-dukkha.
Double-suffering.
And of course from double-suffering we go into the next stage of treble-suffering.
[laughter].
I'm angry about being angry about being angry.
I'm so sad about being sad about being grieving.
Now this is actually what people do.
"They actually build it up by their reactions of trying to get rid of things, controlling things."
"The first part of the Buddhist reaction, the wise reaction, is just accept this is your reality."
"Let it go, let it be if you like."
"So stop messing around with these emotions in this moment, stop adding negativity to the emotions you're experiencing right now."
"If someone is grieving for the loss of a child, or they're disappointed because a relationship they cherished is no longer viable, or if they're afraid - be honest to that fear."
"I don't know, I feel like my mindfulness practice brings me closer to this conversation."
"I have to teach, right."
The curriculum is not outside of this.
"There are ways that we can definitely skillfully use curriculum, the choices that we make, so that they nourish the young people."
"We don't just cover them with stuff,  this is the thing, we just deliver the lesson with this type  of languages that we have in the school."
I am just sharing here.
I think there is this moment where touching and  really looking clearly at what is there.
"And then, that also begins to tells us  what is not there."
That begins to inform our practice in terms of other ways of being that we can occupy and  what we can offer into the classroom in the midst of the essay and  the pre-writing and the brainstorming and all the things that we are doing.
"I work in an English reading  and writing classroom, so I have been looking at how mindfulness is an expression of literacy of reading."
"What do you see,  what do I see as a teacher."
Do I see just a student?
Or do I see somebody that I don't like?
"Do I see my own perceptions,  and live through those perceptions?"
What am I listening to?
What can I hear?
Do I even have the space to hear?
Maybe I feel really overwhelmed.
So I just hear the noise and I get aggravated and I lash out.
"I think, I am using my professional practice and the language around teaching or the educationist things and trying to disrupt that a little bit,  to try to wrestle it back."
Just like we are doing here.
"We are trying to reclaim walking  so that it is nourishing for us. and not just this thing that ends up  wasting our energy, aggravating it."
"So, in your classrooms, all the things that you do in your classrooms, so many tests right, just to even started in the day."
"When you get into your classroom, what are some things you can do to re-purpose, re-energize, re-use, re-strategize,  deal, adapt that moment for yourself."
"So for instance,  we just got new computers, so I have to check them everyday."
So I can make that really aggravating for myself.
"Or I can sit, get my chair and sit there and breathe and take my time, right?"
"I sweep in my classroom, this is one thing I have to do."
"But you know,do I get angry, ""The kids, they don't know the trash can"", etc."
(Laughter)
"Or I take my time, I don't have to think, right?"
Even better.
"I can go only one way, there's 2 exits, there's one in the lower left corner and there's one in the upper right."
"And as you saw, the maze itself will turn according to where the ball is positioned, so you have a better view of where you are and where you're going to."
You will also notice there are green cubes and there are red cubes.
"The red cubes are those that can't be accessed, and the green cubes can be accessed."
"What I didn't put into this maze but is possible, are one-way cubes: you can go into them one way, but you can't come out of them the same way (you can't go back)."
What I didn't put into them are prison cubes: you can go into them but you can't get out.
"And what I didn't put into the maze are rewards, where I need to hunt through the entire maze, to collect rewards before I am allowed to leave."
That's all possible in the proof of concept.
"And of course, I can go back to the original position of the ball."
"In the mean time, there's a position counter here that says where I am, that shows in which bar and cube I am."
"I'm now in bar 18 cube 1, when I go up I'm in bar 19, still cube 1."
I go back:
I wind up in cube 0.
"I go up: and I wind up in 0.0, which is exactly where I need to be."
That's it.
I hope you enjoyed this.

This discotheque owner is also DJ in order to save money.
The only cost for music is the two percent to composer and lyricist.
A cost of no more than SEK 200 a night.
A popular orchestra would cost tenfold.
-Most of them refuse to play disco music.
The play socially critical music you can't dance to.
They are welcome to play that but then they can expect to be unemployed.
-We've tried the last two or three years to play seventy percent disco music but it is apparently not enough.
-The new technology is here to stay.
"It has many advantages in terms of stimulating the music scene, interest in music and so on -"
- but it can't serve as an alternative to a job outcompeting the live music.
"Beer to thirsty disco dancers, but now the Musician's union want to retract liquor licenses to dance halls who don't play live music."
-I refuse to play music my guests at large does not want to deal with and then some bastard blackmail me and take away my rights.
It is the part of Swedish society today that I must strongly protest against.
Also amusement parks begins to stop using dance bands.
This weekend saw the premiere of the dance to video discotheques and the Musicians' union advice all artists to not participate in these kinds of video recordings.
No aunty I can't do it
What is it that you're worried about and can't do? you will go on stage and sing the songs that you know say couple sentences and you will be done she's right we will do what we usually do in weddings
No..
I can't do it
The stage is ready sister
"Ok they will come, you go"
- get up - No
Get up the stage is waiting for you get up with your right foot
Let's go my sister! who told you where we are?
My mother told me what you're doing?
All what is happening to us is because of Cobra
If you want I will go on stage.. you can't do it
No don't intervene in this matter.. we've everything under control just sit here
We'll spin and shake our waist twice then we'll be done how can this happen Aunt kadriyeh it can.. it can
Everyone is waiting for you sisters they didn't die yet! you don't leave an artist speaks two sentences here..
Oh God!! come on go..
And then this 1 is right over here.
"So now, I think we are ready to think about what would happen if we wanted to make 50 houses."
So let's try to do that.
Let me do that in orange.
This right over here is our 50th house.
So this is the shared left wall it has.
This is the 50th house right over here.
So how many total toothpicks for 50 houses?
"So if we have 50 houses, well, we can use the pattern that we came up with."
"It's going to be equal to, starting with our 6, the first house requires 6."
"And then we're going to add 5 for each incremental house, so plus 5 for each incremental house."
And how many incremental houses are there going to be?
"Well, there are going to be 50 minus 1 incremental houses."
Why minus 1?
"Well, you already built one of them with the 6."
Then for every extra one-- so there's going to be 49 extra houses-- you're going to add 5 toothpicks apiece.
So this is going to be equal to 6 plus 5 times 49.
And that is 245.
So 6 plus 245 is equal to 251 sticks.
And what's really neat about this pattern we just came up with is you could use it to figure out how many sticks you would need for a million of these little toothpick townhouses.
What is hypothesis testing in the constant expected return models?
So what are the kinds of things that we can test hypotheses about?
"So our model says continuously compounded returns are equal to a constant mean return plus a random, noise component that represents news that enters the market."
"This noise component is assumed to be, independent identically distributed as a normal random variable with mean zero and a constant volatility."
"And we also assume that covariances, contemporary covariances between assets are constant."
As well.
So there are a number of things that we could test in this model.
So here are some examples of. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Possibly interesting hypothesis test.
We can test for specific values.
"For example, we can test hypothesis that the mean return is equal to some particular value."
For example we can say we want to test hypotheses that the mean return on
Microsoft is two percent per month.
And we did find a lot of stuff.
"We found a lot of Tyrannosaurs, but we found one special Tyrannosaur, and we called it B-rex."
And B-rex was found under a thousand cubic yards of rock.
"It wasn't a very complete T. rex, and it wasn't a very big T. rex, but it was a very special B-rex."
"And I and my colleagues cut into it, and we were able to determine, by looking at lines of arrested growth, some lines in it, that B-rex had died at the age of 16."
"We don't really know how long dinosaurs lived, because we haven't found the oldest one yet."
But this one died at the age of 16.
"We gave samples to Mary Schweitzer, and she was actually able to determine that B-rex was a female based on medullary tissue found on the inside of the bone."
"Medullary tissue is the calcium build-up, the calcium storage basically, when an animal is pregnant, when a bird is pregnant."
So here was the character that linked birds and dinosaurs.
But Mary went further.
"She took the bone, and she dumped it into acid."
"Now we all know that bones are fossilized, and so if you dump it into acid, there shouldn't be anything left."
But there was something left.
There were blood vessels left.
"There were flexible, clear blood vessels."
And so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur.
It was extraordinary.
"But she also found osteocytes, which are the cells that laid down the bones."
"And try and try, we could not find DNA, but she did find evidence of proteins."
"But we thought maybe -- well, we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground."
We thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast.
"And so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18-wheeler trailer, and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples."
And we did.
We got better material.
The cells looked better.
The vessels looked better.
Found the protein collagen.
"I mean, it was wonderful stuff."
But it's not dinosaur DNA.
"So we have discovered that dinosaur DNA, and all DNA, just breaks down too fast."
"We're just not going to be able to do what they did in ""Jurassic Park."""
like it was quickly ported over.
"It doesn't convey that level of effort, and people are going to see that and make judgments off of how much effort you put into it."
It's kind of a negative note to end it on.
"All right, well thank you for coming."
Hey there.
I'm Paul Irish.
I'm a Developer Advocate on the Google Chrome team and today
I'm going to show some advanced uses of the core Chrome Dev Tools features.
"First, let's enter into the dev tools."
It's common to use the app's menu.
"And you can also use a keyboard shortcut, like Ctrl-shift-I on Windows or Cmd-option-I on Mac."
But I prefer to open them by right-clicking on an element and choosing Inspect.
"Now that we have this open, I can navigate the DOM by clicking on the arrows, but it's much quicker to use the keyboard arrow keys to traverse up and down the DOM tree."
"You'll notice as I'm selecting these elements, I get an onscreen blue highlight, but I also get a css selector that represents that element, along with its current width and height."
"Sometimes, I like to zoom out of the page with ctrl - to get the full view while I do this."
"Now, over in the Console tab, I'd like to share a few things."
"Let's say that you have a big string coming from your app, and you want to copy it into your clipboard."
"While you certainly could highlight the entire string with your mouse, it's much more effective to use the console's built in copy method."
I can now paste this wherever I am going.
Sometimes you get too much text in the console.
You can use the clear() function to clear it out.
"Or, of course, the clear icon below will do just the same."
"Now sometimes, you have a reference to a DOM element, and you want to inspect it."
"Right now, I have a reference to the big headline on the page."
A simple way to do that is the console's inspect function.
"Now, let's say you have the reverse:"
You're
"looking at an element in the Elements tab, but you want to access it via scripts."
What
I used to do is add an ID onto the element and use getElementByld.
You'll notice I brought up the console right here.
"In fact, I can toggle on a console on every tab of the dev tools with the escape key."
"So if I had the buffer contents A, B, C, D, E, right, and if I could slam those into a vector, and then I would need one other little bit of information here, which is where is the cursor in any given point because the cursor is actually where the uncertain lead operations take place relative to the cursor."
"The buffer's also going to manage that, knowing where the insertion point is and then deleting it and inserting relative to that."
"So I say, okay."
I need some index.
The cursor actually is between two character positions.
"This is like slot zero, one, and two."
"And the cursor is between, actually, one and two."
"And there's just a minor detail to kind of have worked out before we start trying to write this code, which is do we want the cursor to hold the index on the character that's to the left of it or to the right of it."
"It's totally symmetric, right."
"If I have these five characters, it could be that my cursor then goes from zero to four, it could be that it goes from zero to five, or it could be it goes from negative one to four, depending on which way I'm doing it."
I'm going to happen to use the one that does zero to five where it's actually recorded as the character that's after it.
Okay.
So that's just kind of the staring point.
I'm going to write some code and make it happen.
So I'm going to remove this.
"Reference it, that's okay."
And then I'm going to add the things I want to replace it with.
So I put in the editor code and to put in the buffer code.
Was buffer already in here?
I think buffer's already here.
Okay.
Let's take a look.
I get my buffer.
"So right now, let's take a look what's in buffered."
I think I have the starting set information.
"So it has move cursor over, you know move the cursor around, it has the delete, and it has - let me make it have some variables that I want."
I've got my cursor.
I've got my vector of characters.
"Right now, it has a lot of copying, I think, just in anticipation of going places where copying is going to be required."
"Right now, because it's using vector and vector has deep copying behavior, I'm actually okay if I let windows copy and go through."
But I'm actually going to not do that right away.
All right.
"Oh, no."""
I'll happily trade off some FDP upload time for manage dependencies.
- OK.
Two comments on that.
"Most embedding framework,"
I would encourage you to embed a jar version of the frameworks.
"If you look at since 5.2, I think."
"You can actually jar your framework, and they would work just the same."
"You can just dump them in your application in content extensions, and they're going to get loaded exactly like any other framework."
"It's very compact, it works really well."
You cannot [indecipherable] jar.
You can have flat jars which are the same.
"The other comment that I would say on the size of the app, is that gziped your app, before you upload them, you will save more time."
"It's incredible, I have seen so many people trying to upload a .woa not zipped."
It takes forever because the protocol are usually very inefficient on starting and stopping files.
"You are going to upload hundreds of small, tiny files, which is crazy."
- Yes
"- gzip's them, you'll be surprised you can save one, if not two order of magnitude in the upload."
"- If I can continue with that, once you have zipped it and put it up once, use RSync to sync it after that, because then you only move differences."
- Don't do that.
The reason you should not do that is because you will have a running app on the old version.
"If you have multiple instances, you really should upload it into a different folder and do a version swap so you have..."
"- To be clear, you should shut down the production site prior..."
"- No, no."
You don't want to shut down the production site.
You want to keep it running.
"- You just Rsynching the zip file, not the app."
- Then you have to unzip it on the server.
"- No, you're proposing unzipping the WOA, I think."
"- I was Rsynching the WOA, right?"
But I shut down the site.
- If you don't want to shut down your production site and you don't want to be replacing your WOA in line.
And are you any more intelligent than a small little novice.
Why is it that these emotions they catch us.
And why is it?
"Because we don't see them coming, we encourage them too much."
"Every time we think negatively,"
"""oh, the ghost is going to come to us"" or we think negatively ""I'm going to lose my job"" or we think negatively ""I'm going to get that cancer."
I'm going to get it.
I know
I'm going to get it.
"Now I'm fine but I am."""
"When you think negatively like that you're building up the emotions, the emotions you get are built up by many many moments of unskillful attitudes and thoughts."
But now we have them.
So once you know where they come from you know they're actually created.
"At least if you know that you create them, you actually bring them together, even like grief.."
Why do you have to have grief when somebody dies?
Why can't we just celebrate that fact that we've known these people for such a long time.
What a wonderful time we had together.
Now we just let them go.
"You never cry for the person who's died, you always cry for yourself."
At your loss - nothing to do with them..
So when we understand that we can do something about these things it gives us a possibility to actually to transcend those negative emotions.
"Because when you think about it, reflect upon it, what good does grief do?"
It doesn't help the person who's dead.
It doesn't help yourself.
It's not what the dead person really wants from you - they don't want you to be unhappy and to cry all those hours and days.
"If someone really loved you and you loved them, they want you to be happy, to live your life in as much fullness and joy as you possibly can."
If you really revere their memory surely that's what you should do.
Not to grieve for them but to be happy for them.
"For you to be happy, for them."
"So when we can change our attitudes that way, when we can actually do something about our grief, or like our anger - what good does anger do?"
"Every time you get angry at your partner they don't do what you want them to do, they don't get better - they usually get worse!"
So why get angry and shout at them for?
"Now, what I want to think about is how these characters will change their state due to their incentives."
Then we'll talk a little bit about Nash Equilibrium as well.
"On this axis, up here, lets' say this is one of the competitors."
"This is where they produce 25, and let's say on the ultimate cheating quantity of 75, and this is somewhat close to the market, or that is the equilibrium quantity if this was perfect competition, they produce half of that, so this is them producing 37.5 units."
"As we go from 25 to 37.5 units, they are cheating more."
"This is more cheating and over here, this was no cheating."
We can do the same thing for the blue player.
I'll write them as B. This is them producing 25.
This is them producing 37.5.
"As we go up and up and up, they are cheating more."
"This is a lot of cheating, or more cheating."
"To think of it in a Game theoretical way, this is the Pareto optimal state right over here."
It's optimal in many ways.
This is they've maximized the total economic profit here.
There's no other state that one person would benefit without making the other worse.
"Now, let's think about whether this is a Nash equilibrium."
Let's remind oursleves what Nash equilibrium was.
"This was a state where holding all the other players constant, so in this case there's only one other player, a player can't gain by changing strategy."
"In this case, changing strategy is changing your output."
Let's see if that is true of this state right over here.
"Well, let's hold A constant."
"If A is constant, we're in this column right over here."
"Is there something B can do, is there change or strategy B can do, that would allow B to gain?"
Sure.
B can increase production.
That's what we saw in the last video.
We would go from this bottom right state to one right above it.
"Now B's economic profit is 280, A's is 200."
"The pie has shrunk, but B has got a larger chunk of it."
That was not a Nash equilibrium.
"There is, holding all others constant, there is a player that can gain by changing their strategy."
"The Nash equilibrium definition, just to make sure, they say it's a state where holding others constant no player can gain by changing strategy."
"They had a server tag which resembled their script tag, which caused stuff to run on the server, and they had a write function which would cause the insertion of whatever text you were writing into the HTML output stream."
So it had all of the vulnerabilities that PHP has.
"It had all the disadvantages of the other template system plus, at the time, a pretty slow JavaScript engine."
That product was eventually withdrawn and replaced with J2EE.
"What if we did it right, instead, this time?"
We have one of those opportunities in history where we can try it again and this time get it right.
What if we had server side JavaScript with an event loop?
Not a template system but an event loop.
"Well, it turns out we've got it."
We already have it.
"It's node.js, which runs on top of V8."
"It implements a web server in a JavaScript event loop, and it is brilliant."
It is a very high performance event pump.
"It can take events and move them really fast through its event queue, in and out and across the world."
"Not only that, it got READ right."
"Here's the final system read from node.js, and it has a callback function."
"The callback function receives the data that you ask to read, and that's right."
"I mean, we finally have a correctly implemented, correctly designed read function."
"Everything in the node.js API is non-blocking, or should have been."
There are a couple of exceptions.
"One is, it has some synchronous functions which do block."
That's really unfortunate.
I wish they weren't there.
"There are non-blocking versions for most of them, but there shouldn't be any."
It's just too big a hazard.
"The other is, there's a require function that blocks, which is used for loading script."
"That's really unfortunate, I'd like to see that fixed too."
"But otherwise, node.js is just really good stuff."
There are a lot of advantages that come from it.
One is that you can run the same stuff on both sides of the network.
We can take YUI -- the same YUI that you're running in the browser -- and run it in the server.
That means your applications can run on either side.
"I'm saying that when you ask teachers, ""What do you mean when you tell your students to 'pay attention,' 'focus,' 'concentrate.'"""
"You know, just like a camera, hold that image still."
I go to the students.
"So when your teacher tells you, ""Pay attention, focus, concentrate."""
What is she telling you?
Hold that image still as if you were taking a picture?
"I ask people at work, old people, young -- everybody says the same thing."
"Well, in fact, the only way you can really pay attention, most of the time, is to vary the image."
"So, whey don't you sort of look at your finger."
Do -- look at your finger.
"Now, if you want to stay attentive to your finger, you have to notice new things."
You can't just see it as the same way it was yesterday.
"I say, my goodness, this finger is different from an hour ago."
I notice a little piece of dirt here; there's a wrinkle I wasn't aware of...
That noticing these things is what keeps you attentive.
Right.
"So, in fact, we have all these people who are trying to pay attention..."
So we assume it's just a finger.
"Well, when you assume it's just a finger; (it can't change) that there's nothing new that by not looking for newness (right), it fades from view."
It's a very hard thing to do.
"When you're noticing new things about it, which is the essence of mindfulness and mindful learning, is that it becomes interesting to you."
Even something that might seem so uninteresting as (a finger!) the tip of your finger.
"Now, but this has tremendous implications for things like"
Hey!
"For today's illustration, I'm going to be using some pieces of paper."
"Now, if I take these pieces of paper and try to juggle them..."
...it doesn't work very well!
I can't do it!
"But if I take the paper and mold it into the shape of a juggling ball, it becomes something I can work with and use."
We need to be kind of like these pieces of paper -- we need to allow God to shape us and mold us into what He wants us to be.
"See, God wants to do all kinds of awesome things through us, but if we don't allow Him to shape us and mold us into what He wants us to be, then how are we supposed to be of use?"
Isaiah 64:8 talks about God as our potter and us as the clay.
"Suppose you want to represent sets of strings, well you basically just generalize the hash function."
I think one of the classic ones for strings is called the
Rabin-Karp algorithm.
And it's simply the same idea that you have a mapping from your import into a set of integers.
"Wow, OK, maybe not so wow, but this is now constant."
This is constant time access.
So I can do searching in constant time which is great.
Where's the penalty?
What did I trade off here?
Well I'm going to suggest that what I did was I really traded space for time.
It makes me sound like an astro physicist somehow right?
What do I mean by that?
"I have constant time access which is great, but I paid a price, which is I had to use up some space."
In the case of integers it was easy.
"In the case of characters, so I have to give up a"
"list of 256, no big deal."
Imagine now you want to do faces.
"You've got a picture of somebody's face, it's a million pixels."
Each pixel has a range of values from zero to 256.
I want to hash a face with some function into an integer.
"I may not want to do the full range of this, but I may decide I have to use a lot of gigabytes of space in order to do a trade off."
"The reason I'm showing you this is it that this is a gain, a common trade off in computer science."
"That in many cases, I can gain efficiency if I'm willing to give up space."
"Having said that though, there may still be a problem, or there ought to be a problem that may be bugging you slightly, which is how do I guarantee that my hash function takes any input into exactly one spot in the storage space?"
She give any reason for discontinuing these appointments?
"Yes, she told me she was convinced that her condition was a spiritual one."
"It was the conviction of her priest, she said, and she shared his beliefs."
Was it your impression that Emily had placed her care... ...entirely..?
- Leading the witness.
Sustained.
After the end of October... ...did you ask Emily why she had stopped... ...filling her Gambutrol prescriptions?
Yes.
"Back 1 in x, we go down 3."
Just like that.
"So if we connect the dots here, it'll look something like this."
I'll do my best to draw a straight line.
"So the second graph, 2y plus 4 equals 6, we put it into slope-intercept form and we graphed it."
"Now, the whole point of this question was to identify the number of solutions that it has, the system."
A solution to a system of equations is an x and y value that satisfy both of these equations.
"Now, if there were such an x and y value that satisfied both of these equations, then that x and y value would have to lie on both of these graphs."
Because this blue line is all of the pairs of x and y's that satisfy the first equation.
The red line is all of the pairs of x's and y's that satisfy the second equation.
"So if something's going to satisfy both, it's got to be on both lines."
"When you look here, are there any points that are on both lines?"
"Well, no."
These two lines never intersect.
A point of intersection is a point that is common to both of these lines.
"No, they don't intersect."
No intersection.
So there is not a solution to this system of equations.
There is no solution.
We know that because these two lines don't intersect.
And you didn't even have to graph it.
The kind of giveaway was that these are two different lines.
"They have different y-intercepts, but their slopes are identical."
"So if you have two different y-intercepts and your slopes are identical, then you have two different lines that will never intersect."
"And if they represent a system, or if they're the graphs of a system of equations, that system has no solution."
We tried talking to him about the hot topic right now.

And the soundtrack tells us the story.
It begins with a romantic score.
"But then, as he begins to doubt and explain his reasons, the track will change."
"And we'll slip closer into that mysterium score we had, which is associated with Finn and the ghost ship. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; I expected a different response Will."
"I thought we were both waiting for this. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; I had waited, I wanted this."
"Now this what I do and say, I'm afraid. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Afraid of me?"
"A very important scene, because it's our only exposition on his past."
"And it's our first insight into his mind, that he is questioning himself."
"[music] &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; It was awful, Helen, I've never forgotten it."
We were run down in a fog of the coast of.
"Now, of course, the audience is meant to be paying attention to the performance and the actors and the characters and maybe not notice the sound directly."
But it's there and it's working on us.
And it's one of the ways that this film chips away at happy surfaces and shows us that underneath.
"There's despair, there is fear and death."
I mean this is a man who's already been consumed by his job who can no longer love. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; By this morning when the boy testified against me I could barely keep my seat.

"Give me a chance to get over this, this feeling that I don't know myself."
"And he's going to try to make ammends, and offer a happy future, but we know better."
"And so he can try to make a moment offer a happy future, but we know better."
"We know, I think by this point that he is beyond, beyond hope."
"Now Ghost Ship is actually more innovative by using sounds within the film world to comment on and undercut the surface story to show the dark side while the rest of the crew seems to think things are, are going well."
And I think this is mainly how Sir Lancelot works who plays Billy Radd.
He's the calypso singer.
"And watch how it works in, in this particular moment, we're going to hear that theme of blow the man down come back in."
"And its coming in, right as the radio man is talking about how he keeps his nose clean, and he is going to ignore [crosstalk] the danger's by putting on his headset."
"Life is easy for him, now we have this."
[music]
Way blow the man down.
Roll up your white canvas jib spanker and all.
Give me some time to blow the man down.
Then the breeze it blew gaily a terrible gale.
"It's actually a scene that's a simple ellipsis showing the ship traveling, right?"
But I'm going to look at the hook scene now because it's a fabulous example of how sound and image can create a monster where there's no monster there.
"Innocently enough, with a little hook, actually a big hook, swinging on a chain and the sailor noticing it."
Just a little sound.
"Right, and so our hero mimics exactly what his officer told him."
[inaudible]
Now we cut to the sinister scene on the bridge and this lighting is just mad.
"We got this low lighting that comes right on their faces, the sound of the bells which is a motif across the film and quiet talk."
"So, we're going in to a dark, dark world here and that setting up the attack of the monster watch."
"Still in gentle sling, but now it's a massive beast that's intruding into the frame, and in the first attack of the hook."
"Watch by Stone using passes, and in-communicative and stern, and also simply wrong."
[crosstalk]
"Now, the it's going to, to become the monster at night, attacking the night watchmen."
"We hear the crashing, off screen sound."
"We don't see it and he's going to use his flashlight to track it, there it goes."
It explodes across the foreground.
We can see its distance of the swing by how he moves the flashlight.
We don't actually see how much it's swinging.
And now the crashing becomes more complex.
We hear it swing and then crash into something.
"And then swing again, but we don't see it."
So sound is mapping the movement before we see it.
"Then we discover it, right?"
"We discover all the parts, too."
"We see it swing past the man out over the deck, and then come back to hit this ladder."
And any ladders that sound to crash[SOUND].
The climax that this is the boat and it illustrates the power of this things.
"Finally, we get it done to control that just variable."
"Disaster is averted, there really is too much potential energy to tie down this hook."
Which mean this is not really about the hook at all.
There's something on this ship that must explode.
"There is something troubling that will break through the surface, and harm men no matter how hard they try."
"And by using sound, I think what Lewton and Robson do is make it more than a hook."

-And that will conclude Elmo's order.
Let's say I have an n-by-n matrix that looks like this.
So let me just see if I can do it in general terms.
"In the first row and first column, that entry has a 1, and then everything else, the rest of the n minus 1 rows in that first column are all going to be zeroes."
So it's going to be zeroes all the way down to the nth term.
"And then the second column, we have a 0 in the first component, but then a 1 in the second component."
And then it goes zeroes all the way down.
And you keep doing this.
"In the third row, or let me say third column, although it would've applied to the third row as well, the 1 shows up in the third component, and then it's zeroes all the way down."
"Essentially, you have the ones filling up the diagonal of this matrix right here."
"So if you go all the way to the nth column or the nth column vector, you have a bunch of zeroes until you get-- you have n minus 1 zeroes, and then the very last component, the nth component there will be a 1."
"So you have essentially, a matrix with ones down the diagonal."
"Now, this matrix has a bunch of neat properties and we'll explore it more in the future."
But I'm just exposing you to this because it has one very neat property relative to linear transformations.
"But I'm going to call this the identity matrix and I'll call this I sub n, and I called that sub n because it's an n-by-n identity matrix."
"I sub 2 would be equal to a 2-by-2 identity matrix, so it would look like that."
And I sub 3 would look like this:
"1 0 0, 0 1 0, 0 0 1."
I think you get the point.
"Now, the neat thing about this identity matrix becomes evident when you multiply it times any vector."
"We can multiply this guy times the n-component vector, a member of Rn."
So let's do that.
"""You're doing so great!"
"Keep going!"" ... and a bad self on the other side saying, ""Aw, come on ... just one won't hurt."""
And sometimes ... in a moment of weakness ... the bad self wins.
Having a slip-up can make you feel guilty and disappointed in yourself ... but that's not helpful.
"In fact, those bad feelings could set you up for another lapse."
"The truth is, slip-ups happen ... and they happen to almost everyone who quits smoking."
So forget the guilt and disappointment.
What's important now is to
learn from your mistake so a lapse doesn't turn into a relapse.
"Chances are, you slipped because of one of three things: your environment ... your cravings ... or your social support system."
So let's take a good look at each one.
First ... your environment.
Think about the slip-up.
When did it happen?
What were you doing?
Who were you with?
Maybe you're used to smoking when you drink coffee or alcohol ... when you go to certain places ... or when you're around people who stress you out.
Keep track of the things that trigger you to smoke.
"It can help you see patterns, which can help you plan how to deal with your triggers ... or avoid them ... so you can stay strong."
"Next, if your cravings got you to light up again, think about nicotine replacement."
Using medicine can more than double your chances of quitting.
Never tried it?
"Consider an over-the-counter product like the patch, inhaler,"
"lozenges, or gum."
"If you're already using nicotine replacement, keep using it ... even if you slipped up ... and ask your doctor if there are other medicines that might help you."
"Finally, how's your support system?"
It's harder to quit if you're around people who aren't ready to quit with you.
"So when you're with people who aren't ready to quit, ask them not to smoke around you ... and spend more time with people who want you to succeed."
"If you could use more people on your side, join a support group ... find an online quit program ... or call a quitline."
"If you have a smart phone, quit-smoking applications are another way to get encouragement."
Some let you record video messages from loved ones that you can watch when you're tempted to smoke.
Other apps can connect you with friends on social networking sites so they can cheer you on.
It just doesn't solve the problem and doesn't actually fulfill its promises.
"And just was it in January, when I was going off to Indonesia to give a series of talks I got to Perth airport and found that the Garuda flight was cancelled."
It was actually delayed by about 18 hours.
"And I was a monk so I just went up to the counter and said, ""Oh is it delayed?"
When is it going to leave?
18 hours.
"Okay, thank you very much,"" and I sort-of called the monastery and got a lift back to the monastery."
"But the people behind me they were thumping the counter - ""You can't do this to us!"
"I've got all of these arrangements and plans!"" I had arrangements and plans as well - thousands of people were waiting to listen to my talks."
But I couldn't do anything about it.
And you know all that anger and all that thumping and all that shouting.. it didn't make the plane leave earlier.
It didn't do anything good at all except making people upset.
"Themselves upset, and other people upset."
So really what is the use of anger?
You can intimidate somebody for a short time but they will always want revenge.
They won't respect you.
"And if you're a boss they'll only do what you want, they'll only do what you want for the time being, only because you're there."
They won't do what you've asked them out of respect.
Just out of fear.
And that's no way to have any sort of relationship or any sort of business.
Really anger doesn't make any sense to me.
So anger and fear and grief and depression these are negative emotions.
So first of all when these happen what should we do about them?
There's something in Buddhism called the second factor of the eightfold path.
The eightfold path is a way to happiness to enlightenment and the second factor is one of my favourite factors of that path.
It's called right intention or right attitude.
And I love that because it is an attitude which we have to everything we deal with in life.
Whether it's the physical world or the emotional world.
The path to enlightenment hinges on our attitude to things.
"So if you have depression or anger or grief, what should one's reaction be?"
"And the three parts of right attitude in Buddhism - second factor of the eightfold path - is letting go, kindness and gentleness."
The three factors.

There is an edit mode that lets you go into a replace mode and it'll actually give you suggestions for a given misspelled word.
"But you can't do a document check for all of your errors like you can, with, you know, more sophisticated spell checkers."
I've never played with that.
"And when I get home, that's something I'm going to mess around with."
It sounds like it would be a good thing for me to know about.
[Apple software speaking voice reading letters of the alphabet]
"Alright, so now ... [Apple software speaking voice]"
Someone is saying I have two spaces.
"And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what's confusing."
"And this is something, it takes a little bit getting used to."
For those of you who are Windows screen reader users-- when you are move letter by letter or word by word you are always on the character that you are landing on.
"And if you type, you're always going to push that character to the right."
"So whether you're moving three words or ten letters, it doesn't matter."
Your cursor is always going to end up on the character that will be pushed to the right if you type.
"With the i devices, the difference is significant, in that, if you arrow to the left you're before the word or letter."
"If you arrow to the right, you're after the letter."
"And one of the things I keep doing now is I'm hitting the Option Right arrow-- um, and I'm thinking I'm before the word, but I'm actually ending up after the word."
"So, I'm actually finding that a little confusing myself because I've been working on a Windows PC all week and this is a little bit different for me, cuz I haven't taken notes with this maybe in a week, week and half."
"So, let me see if I can quickly get this word fixed here for you guys."
"[Apple software speaking voice reading letters of the alphabet, speaking some words]"
"And what I'm showing you guys, and this is very interesting, you can tell, all the notes I take"
I email to myself.
I don't edit them on this device.
I email them to my PC.
And I edit them using Windows.
They don't take money from these various companies so you can trust that they are going to be honest in their evaluation.
So some good sites to use when you are making some purchases.
But there is information gathering.
"Phase Il, Evaluating Some of The Alternatives."
Let me tell you on page 195 there is What Kind of Spender Are You?
An excellent exercise.
So excellent I even made this a part of your assignment.
"So, when you get to your assignment and it sends you to page 195 and then it asks you to answer 1, 2 and 3, that right there at the bottom where it says 1,2 and 3 that is what I am referring to in that assignment."
Then this book is talking specifically about vehicles.
"So, when you are doing your comparison type shopping several things you need to look at when buying a vehicle."
"Now you would use similar type things on other major purchases, but look at used vehicles, new vehicles, and then also look at the other option of leasing a vehicle."
Lots of different things weigh on which one you need.
If you are on the road all the time and you put lots and lots of miles on a car it may be that you need to purchase a new vehicle.
We never purchase a new vehicle.
When you drive off the parking lot with a new vehicle the value of that vehicle goes down thousands and thousands of dollars because once you buy it it becomes a used vehicle.
"So, let someone else lose all that value on it."
"The average used car is $10,000 less than a new one."
We buy low-mileage used ones.
"Usually they are cars where either someone buys it, they don't drive it a lot."
The last one we bought was from an elderly couple.
She was actually ill and it was her car.
She never drove it.
"So I got a nice luxury car for the same thing I could have paid for an average new car, but I have a nice nice car."
If I would have bought a new car
"I would have a new car, but I wouldn't have had all the luxury."
It would have just been an average car.
"So, I prefer to buy used."
They have gotten all the lemon bugs worked out of it and we have just always found that to be a much better option for us.
Of course we drive our cars until they are worn out.
"So, you know we are not trading it in every year."
"If you like to drive a new car and you can afford to drive a new car all the time, that is wonderful."
You might look into purchasing.
"Let's say what this actually means, divide and conquer."
Divide and conquer says basically do the following: split the problem into several sub-problems of the same type.
"I'll come back in a second to help binary searches matches in that, but that's what we're going to do."
"For each of those sub-problems we're going to solve them independently, and then we're going to combine those solutions."
And it's called divide and conquer for the obvious reason.
I'm going to divide it up into sub-problems with the hope that those sub-problems get easier.
"It's going to be easier to conquer if you like, and then"
I'm going to merge them back.
"Now, in the binary search case, in some sense, this is a little bit trivial."
What was the divide?
The divide was breaking a big search up into half a search.
"We actually threw half of the list away and we kept dividing it down, until ultimately we got something of size one to search."
That's really easy.
"The combination was also sort of trivial in this case because the solution to the sub-problem was, in fact, the solution to the larger problem."
But there's the idea of divide and conquer.
I'm going to use exactly that same ideas to tackle sort.
"Again, I've got an unordered list of n elements."
I want to sort it into a obviously a sorted list.
And that particular algorithm is actually a really nice algorithm called merge sort.
And it's actually a fairly old algorithm.
It was invented in 1945 by John von Neumann one of the pioneers of computer science.
"And here's the idea behind merge sort, actually I'm going to back into it in a funny way."
Let's assume that I could somehow get to the stage where
I've got two sorted lists.
How much work do I have to do to actually merge them together?
So let me give you an example.
"Suppose I want to merge two lists, and they're sorted."
"Just to give you an example, here's one list, 3121724"
"Here's another list, 12430."
"I haven't said how I'm going to get those sorted lists, but imagine I had two sorted lists like that."
How hard is it to merge them?
"Well it's pretty easy, right?"
And you can confirm that I found for these numbers that theta 1 is about 7.5 degrees.
This is now for maxima.
And so roughly at an angle which is half that value you will find silence.
Silence means that the two radio waves will kill each other.
Essential for the maximum to be here is of course that the two transmitters are in phase.
We could have rigged it up so that they were 180 degrees out of phase in which case there would be silence here.
Silence in this case means that the radar would kill the radar.
"But I do use the word silence for a good reason, because the way we rigged this up is the same way we did it before."
We modulate this 10-gigahertz signal with a 1000-hertz audio signal.
We call that amplitude modulation.
And the receiver which is here receives the 10-gigahertz radiation which is modulated at 1000 hertz.
We feed it to an amplifier.
We demodulate it and you will hear the 1000 hertz.
And so we can also move it along this track here and find the location X1 whereby we have our first maximum apart from the 0.
And I found that that is very roughly at 15.5 centimeters.
And you should confirm that using those equations.
Equations are the same.
"Whether you deal with sound or with red laser light or with gigahertz, makes no difference."
And so let's turn now to this demonstration.
I will turn on the -- the two transmitters and here is the receiver which is exactly at angle theta 0.
So there's a maximum.
"I'm now going to close one transmitter, [tone] put my hand in front."
[tone]
And you think about what will be the reduction of intensity of the sound here.
[tone]
"If I close one, it's substantially down."
You may think that it is down by a factor of two.
Because we have only one transmitter instead of two.
You're wrong.
"If you think that, you do not understand interference."
It is 4 times lower when I hold my hands over one.
Figure it out for yourself.
But all three that you can tell are leveling off.
"We in Computer Sceience, about seven years ago, hit a ledge and it was a problem."
"We couldn "" t make the computers any faster."
"We couldn't make the frequency faster, we couldn't use more power, we couldn't make the computers as we thought we could."
They couldn't follow this exponential curve anymore.
"What happen was we were making too much heat, way too much heat."
And we'll get to that.
"But, we solved this problem by making multiple cores."
"If we have multiple cores, they could do multiple things at the same time and that's increase of speed the same way."
"And as you can see the Parallell, the"
Parallel Thread Performance has increased and while the Single Thread stays the same
Awesome.
"So, heat, computers have this 0's and 1's transistors,, and every time you change it, it wastes heat, and capacitors, we'll get to that later."
"But it wastes heat and you can see this graph that over time we had some hot ones, and cold ones and so far we've been able to cool them with heat sinks and fans."
Nothing too special.
"Around 2000, we started making really hot computers and back in 1995 [INAUDlBLE] was as hot as a hot plate."
"Loves this example, that if it's as hot as a hot plate, and you had an egg that size, you could fry the egg on your computer because it's that hot."
Wow.
Come on.
"So, computers have only gotten hotter."
They've actually gotten to the heat of a nuclear reactor.
"Of course it's not gigantic, it's just the size of a quarter."
But it makes as much heat as a nuclear reactor.
And soon we're actually even close to rocket nozzles and the sun's surface.
They're just going to get so hot.
"And we've made all kinds of cool cooling systems with hydration and water and air and just really crazy cooling systems, and we've found that we just can't keep this up."
There's no way about it.
"So it ws like a game of chicken, who's going to give up first, and around 2004, 2005, we gave up and we got to the heat of a nuclear reactor and after that we just gave up."
"We can't cool it anymore, So we just moved to multiple cores."
Cool.
So let's see why this actually helps.
Well having multiple cores actually makes it more power efficient.
And let's say its mass is 500 grams.
And let's say that I can accelerate this vehicle at an acceleration of-- I don't know-- 3 centimeters per second squared.
What's the force that I need to apply to this mass to accelerate it at this speed?
And we want the answer in Newton's.
So what's the force?
So we're just going to use Newton's second law and
Newton's second law tells us force is equal to mass times acceleration.
"So you might want to, or you might be tempted just to multiply mass times acceleration and you'd get force is equal to-- let's see, 500 grams times 3 centimeters per second squared."
"And you would get force is equal to 1,500 gram centimeters per second squared."
"And if you did this, you would be right."
"Although your answer would not be in Newtons and now you would have to somehow, try to convert this set of units to Newtons."
And what are Newtons?
"Well we learned when we did Newton's laws that a Newton, so 1 Newton is equal to 1 kilogram meter per second squared."
So somehow we have to convert the gram to kilograms and we have to convert the centimeters to meters.
"We could do it after the fact here, or what I find it easier to do is actually to convert the mass and the acceleration units first and then just do the F equals ma."
So what's 500 grams in kilograms?
"Well 500 grams is half-- well, a kilogram as a thousand grams."
So 500 is going to be half a kilogram.
"1 kilogram is a thousand grams, so 0.5 kilograms is 500 grams."
"Similarly, 3 centimeters is how many meters?"
"Well, 1 meter is 300-- sorry."
I think I'm dehydrated.
"1 meter is a hundred centimeters, right?"
So 3 centimeters is 0.03 meters per second squared.
Hopefully this make sense to you.
3 centimeters is 0.03 meters.
And now we already.
We have our mass in kilograms and we have our acceleration in meters per second squared.
"And if this is confusing, you should watch the unit videos because this is all I'm doing; I'm just doing unit conversion."
So let's go back to force equals mass times acceleration.
"So the force was equal to 0.5 kilograms times the acceleration, which is 0.03 meters per second squared."
And this equals--
"[INAUDlBLE] just take the cost of the machine and estimate the amount of time we want, and then divide it?"
JON GRUBER:
Sure.
"No, and I'll cover that later."
"You could think of the rental-- if I bought the machine today and sold it tomorrow, that'd be like I rented it."
And this would be the cost difference between what I paid for it and what I'd sell it for.
"But it's just easier to think of it as the rental, because the flow measure-- like the wage-- is a flow measure."
"Now, in the short-run, capital is fixed."
"So in the short-run, our fixed costs are rk bar."
"That's our fixed cost, the rental rate times the fixed amount of capital in the short-run."
"And our variable costs are w times I, which is a function of q."
"That is, the more you produce the more labor you use in the short-run."
"So total costs in the short-run, short-run total costs, are rk bar plus wL of q. k is not a function of q because k's fixed in the short-run, but the amount of labor used is a function of how much you produce."
"This implies that the marginal cost, the key concept we want to work with, marginal cost, which is the derivative of total costs with respect to quantity."
"So dc dq is going to be equal to w-- or, let's do it in deltas, because we're not doing calculus here."
Delta c delta q is going to be w times delta I over delta q.
That's going to be the marginal cost.
The marginal cost-- so I'm just differentiating the total cost function-- is going to be the wage times delta I delta q.
"So the marginal cost of producing the next unit is going to be how much labor I have to produce to produce the next unit, times the wage I pay per unit of labor."
"Now, does anyone remember what we call this?"
"I know this wasn't on the exam last night, so you may not-- cast your mind back to the lecture on Monday."
Do you remember what we call delta I over delta q?
Anyone?
Bueller?
No?
It's the marginal product of labor.
Remember from Monday?
So this is the wage times the marginal product of labor.
So what we say is that the marginal cost is equal to the wage times the marginal--
I'm sorry the wage over.
"I'm sorry, it's one over."
That delta q does-- I was the marginal product.
"To find the median, or middle, begin by crossing out the least and the greatest  numbers in the set until you reach the middle."
The median of this data set is three.
Now let's review finding the mean.
Here's the same graph again.
"To find the mean, we need to add each of the values together and divide by how many numbers are in the set."
"The numbers total seventy, and we divide by fifteen because there are fifteen data points."
"So, the mean is approximately four and seven-tenths."
That squiggly equal sign means approximately.
"A common mistake that students make  is confusing the mean, median, and mode because they all begin with the letter ""M"" and they do sound a lot alike."
"One way to remember is that the median is the middle,  like the median of a highway."
"The mode is the most,  they sound alike."
"And mean, or average, is the meanest because it requires the most calculation."
Let's look at this graph again.
"We decided earlier that the mode was two, so let's put a line here."
We decided the median was three; we'll put a line here.
And the mean was approximately four and seven-tenths.
These three lines show where the three measures lie within the data.
Which of these looks like the best way to describe the data?
"In this case we have an outlier, or a number that is much less or much greater  than most of the other responses."
"One student read twenty one books, and that's great, but it makes our mean much higher than it would be otherwise."
"The mean is probably not the best measure here because only four students read more books than the mean of four and seven-tenths, while eleven students read fewer."
"On the other hand, the mode of two was the most common answer but does it reflect the data set as a whole?"
Probably the median would be the best measure here.
Let's look at another data set.
Students were asked their favorite number from one to ten.
There were four different answers that all got two votes.
"So, the mode is one, four, five, and nine."
"In any data set there can be a single mode,  many modes (like there are here), or even no mode."
This is why the mode is not used very often to describe data sets.
"When we find and measure a center, we want to use a single number to describe the data."
"So, the mode here is not good."
Let's find the median by crossing out the least  and the greatest until we find the middle.
And I'm just going to begin to pass the tube in.
"And I just want to keep passing it down and the patient will swallow, until I get to that mark that told me I was in all the way."
All right.
"Once we've gotten so that we've passed the tube as far as we want to, we've gotten to the mark that we wanted to get to, and we can secure the tube in the patient's nose."
"And there's a couple of ways you can do that, but we'll use kids tape here."
Make a little flag.
Secure that in the patient's nose.
And then I need to check for placement.
"I'm going to add this Lopez value here, at the end."
"It's a stopcock that is designed to go onto, for tube feedings and for naso-gastric tubes."
"So I'll put this on the end of the Levin tube and then I need to, there's a couple ways that I can check that this tube is in the right place."
"I can have this patient x-rayed, to make sure the tube is in the proper place."
I can withdraw some of the gastric contents and check for pH.
Those two are considered the best gold standards.
The x-ray placement and then the pH.
"PH should indicate that it's very acidic, being in the stomach."
The third mechanism of placement is to add some air in here and to listen with a stethoscope to see if you hear a whoosh.
So you can listen here.
That's the third mechanism.
"It's not as accurate, but it is used a lot in many institutions if they don't have the bedside testing."
"So know what your unit protocol is, what your hospital protocol is."
"So this would be the third one, and I would be listening with a stethoscope here and listening to hear a whoosh from the air."
"Once I know, once I have confirmed placement by either pH, x-ray or air sounds, then I'm going to turn the Lopez valve so that I shut off here to the patient so that it doesn't drip out and then until I'm ready for my feeding."
"Now, depending on which type of feeding it is, it can set up a little different."
"If the patient is going to have an intermittent feeding, every so many hours they get so many cc's of fluid, and you administer it all together, I'm going to need an irrigation tray."
"And this, because this tray has a bulb type syringe, I'm actually going to use a catheter tip syringe also."
So I would have gotten that extra.
And then I have my tube feeding that I'm going to use.
Tube feeding.
Okay.
Okay.
"So I'm going to pour my tube feeding in here, whatever the prescribed amount is."
Find operation requires a little more work.
"So let's look at the Implementation, a demo of that one in operation first."
"So again we, we start out the same way but now the idea array entry really means that every one of these things is a little tree where the one node each everyone pointing to itself."
"It's the root of it's own tree so now if we have to put four and three in the same component, then all we do is we take the root, of the component containing the first item and make that a child of the root of the component, component containing the second item."
In this case we just make four as parent three.
So now three and eight.
"So again, we take the first item and make it a child of the root of the tree containing the second item."
"So now three, four, and eight are in the same component."
Six and five six goes below five.
"Nine and four, So now four is the root of the tree containing four is eight."
And the root of tree containing nine is nine.
And so we make nine a child of eight.
"Two and one, that's an easy one."
"Now if we get our, our eight and nine connected, we just checked that they have the same root and they both have the same root eight and so they're connected."
Five and four 4's root is eight.
5's root is five.
They're different.
They're not connected.
Five and zero.
Five goes to be a child of zero.
Seven and two seven goes to be a child of 2's root which is one.
Six and one.
"6's route is zero 1's its own route, so zero becomes a child of one."
Each one of these union operations just involves changing one entry in the array.
"And finally, seven and three."
"So seven's root is one, three's root is eight, one becomes a child of eight."
Okay and now we have one connected component with all the items together.
"Alright, so now let's look at the code for implementing Quick-union."
The constructor is the same as the other one.
We create the array and then set each element to be it's own root.
"Now we have a private method that implements this process of finding the root by chasing parent pointers until we get to the point where I is equal to ID of I, and if it's not equal, we just move I up one level in the tree, set I equals ID of I and return it."
"So starting at any node, you just follow ID equals ID of I until they're equal and then you're at a root and that's a private method that we can use to implement the find operation or the connected operation."
"X, 1, 2, 4 and whatever but what we need to do that is that organize them like date and time and course and what not."
"And so whenever video editors wrote script, weÃ¢ÂÂd just kind of the programming that you got from here and a little bit previously to do this automatically."
Whenever we record videos we just give it to her and she sorts it automatically and saves the video editors hours of time.
"Okay, thatÃ¢ÂÂs great and I think people once you get a little experience with programming youÃ¢ÂÂil see things like that every day that youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing people could be yourself but itÃ¢ÂÂil less often be yourself spending their time doing tedious things that are not fun for humans."
That you could write a few
"lines of python code to solve and so I hope, at the end of this class and I think by this point in the class many of you really should be at a level where youÃ¢ÂÂre instead of just solving the problems that weÃ¢ÂÂre giving you in the homeworks, youÃ¢ÂÂre finding real problems in your life and in your friends lives that you can solve by writing a little bit of code."
"So, I hope everyone will be doing that and spreading the value of programming literacy beyond that, beyond just yourself."
Second thing we want to talk about building big matrices.
We're gonna build our that big A matrix today and I'm going to teach you how to use.
"Okay, so today, you know, a lot of people use FFTs And there's nothing special about that, they're just means you're a player in the game."
We're gonna learn SP Diags today.
That takes you up a level.
Cuz not a lot of people know that.
"They don't even know what you're talking about and you're like dropping on them,"
"like you don't even know that, yeah."
That's what I walk around doing all day on the ave.
I'm one of those crazy guys.
"And turns out that those dudes don't know SP Diags All right so here's what we are going to do, we're going to make this matrix, and we're going to make it to be."
We're going to chop it up to five points.
In each direction.
"In the x direction five points, Y direction five points."
So our matrix remember is not a five by five.
Remember we're going to restack out data.
It's gonna be five by five times five squared right.
So this is going to be our discretion So that is going to be the size of the matrix we are working with.
Okay.
"So first of all, let's talk about this matrix A. And let's talk about what we want to put in here."
"So first I want, I'm going to make a vector of 1s."
Big vector of ones.
"And what I'm going to do, is I'm gonna make this, what's called the spdiags command."
"And what this is, spdiags, means sparse diagonal."
Diagonals.
"Now, the next thing we have to do is that we've got to relate this probability of backscattering."
We are going to have to relate it to the diameter of those nuclei.
How do we do that?
"Well, the probability of a particle backscattering is simply going to be the total area of this crystal, there's our crystal, the total area of this."
"Now, you've got to ignore these aluminum blocks here because this piece of equipment comes from my laboratory."
And I pressed it into service for this demonstration.
This has nothing to do with the demo that we're going to put here.
It's just structural because this is my manipulator puller-outer from our machine.
"So you've got to ignore those, but that whole area there is equal to 2,148 square inches."
And now the probability of that backscattering is this total area of the nuclei to the total area of the crystal.
"And the total area of the nuclei then is just the sum over all nuclei, and there are 119 of them here."
So i=1 to 119 of the area of each one of the nuclei.
"And so that is just 119 times the cross-sectional area of these nuclei actually, which is pi d squared over 4, and this is all over 2,148."
That's the probability.
This is the diameter of the nuclei.
And now I am going to rearrange that and solve for the diameter.
And when I do that I get 4.79 times P to the one half.
"If I measure the probability of backscattering by this, measuring the number of backscattered balls over the total number we throw at it, then I can calculate the diameter of the nuclei, the diameter of those Styrofoam balls."
That is the idea.
"Now, you're going to do this experiment."
And so now the TAs are going to give you all a ping-pong ball or two.
Come on.
We need to distribute the ping-pong balls.
Here's the deal.
What you have to do is you have to aim to hit this lattice.
That's all you've got to do.
"Then you have to watch your ball, and you have to see if it scatters back to you."
"Now, what doesn't count is if you hit these steel bars and it scatters back."
"That doesn't count, okay?"
It also doesn't count if the ball hits the Styrofoam but it continues going in that direction.
Your ping-pong ball has to actually scatter back at you to count.
"And then, when we get all done, I am going to ask whose ball backscattered."
Please wind stop blowing.
Please wind stop blowing.
Now it's all in the past.
What should I do if I miss you.
I'm just crying like a fool.
Please wind stop blowing.
All right so QuickFind is too slow for huge problems.
"So, how are we going to do better?"
"Our first attempt is an alternative called, Quick-union."
This is so called lazy approach to algorithm design where we try to avoid doing work until we have to.
It uses the same data structure or array ID with size M but now it has a different interpretation.
We are going to think of that array as representing a set of trees that's called a forest as depicted at right.
"So, each entry in the array is going to contain a reference to its parent in the tree."
"So, for example, 3's parent is four, 4's parent is nine."
So 3's entry is four and 4's entry is nine in the array.
Now each entry in the array has associated with it a root.
That's the root of its tree.
"Elements that are all by themselves in just, in their own connected component, point to themselves, so one points to itself but also nine points to itself."
"It's the root of the tree, containing two, four and three."
"So, from this data structure we can associate with each item a root, which is representative, say, of it's connected component."
"So that's the root of three is nine, going up that root."
"Now, once we can calculate these roots, then we can implement the find operation just by checking whether the two items that we're supposed to check with are connective where they have the same root."
"That's equivalent to saying, are they in the same connective component?"
"So that's some work, going to find the roots of each item but the union operation is very easy."
To merge components containing two different items.
Two items that are in different components.
All we do is set the ID of P's route to the ID of Q's route.
"Let's make P's tree point to Q. So in this case, we would change the entry of nine to be six to merge three and five."
The components containing three and five.
And with just changing one value in the array we get the two large components emerged together.
That's the Quick-union algorithm.
Because a union operation only involves changing one entry in the array.
What about a?
"Well, this one is big A, little A, and almost all healthy."
"This one's also a, big A, little A, and almost all healthy."
"This one's a, a and all diseased."
"This one's a, a and almost all diseased."
"So clearly in this case, A, the genotype at the A marker, is more predictive of whether you have the disease, than, than the genotype at the B marker."
"So we can assume that A is probably closer to this, disease causing [inaudible]."
And we haven't said whether it's between A and B or not.
"It could be in that little area above A, as I said before."
All we can do if and this is assumption if this is a simple genetic trait that is fully explained by a single gene having a very large effect.
"What we can do is we can split this section up, this whole section over here and just infer what's going on at the disease causing mutation."
So we are saying these ones are healthy and this one is diseased.
"Or if you only get the disease when you have the mutation then this one must necessarily be little C and little C. And this one over here, must necessary be big C, little c, right?"
"Because these ones are carriers, they're healthy, these ones are diseased."
"So, let's break that up."
"Again, we have another gene causing disease, so we're just splitting this row up."
"So we're taking this original problem that we were looking at two markers and basically now looking at three, the third being what we're inferring to be happening at the disease-causing gene."
"I split this up relative to disease status, and that was it."
"So what we can do is we can split up all these other ones, like this one right here."
"These ones, necessarily are there aren't any."
These ones would be and we can continue the same process that I just did.
So I just broke up everything here.
From the previous slide into this set of individuals.
"And again, we're assuming all big C little C are healthy."
"They're carriers of the disease but they do not exhibit, actually exhibit the disease."
"And little C little C in this case are, are, are all healthy.'Kay?"
"So, without doing any math."
"Without doing any math at all, I want you to tell me the order of the genes here."
"Is the c of disease causing mutation between a and b, is it off past b, or is it off past a?"
It's very simple.
What you do in this case is you just try to figure out which one is the double recombinant.
And from that and since you know the phase you can figure out which one is in the middle.
"Because with purchasing you just, it is kind of like renting or leasing a house, you are kind of borrowing that car for three years and you pay lease and with that lease you can use it so many miles a year and if you go over that it costs you more."
"You do have to pay some money up front but, some different options."
And I want you to look at the different options.
"On page 197, here is Check Out A Used Car."
And it gives you some suggestions on some things that you will want to look at before you decide to purchase a used car.
"On top of page 198, Figuring It Out."
This explains how to determine whether you should buy versus leasing an automobile.
And it shows you how to get the total cost to buy and how to get the total cost to lease.
And I am calling that to your attention because you are going to do one of those in your assignments for today.
"So, it is extremely important that you know that what is on the top of page 198 will give you the information to enable you to do that problem today."
I love that your book gives you information on bargaining.
Throughout this course one of the things I have told you is that my husband and I because we take cash in when we buy a car we have a lot of bargaining power.
"I mean when you say I am willing to write you a check right now today for $8,000 so I will give you my car and I will trade it for that one for $8,000."
"And what I tell them is that it is $8,000 total."
"That includes the taxes, the title, all your little bitty fees you add on."
I am not doing any of that.
"I am giving you my car and $8,000."
Are you willing to do that?
"And you know when you lay it out there in black and white, ha."
And you can do that.
I mean first you can let them...
I will tell you what they try to do that really drives me crazy is instead of talking price of the car they want to talk monthly payment.
"Guys don't fall into that trap. $100 a month, and usually it is $400 a month or $300 a month for six years, is a lot of money!"
Figure out what that car is costing you!
"You know, if you are going on 60 months and I think come people don't realize 60 months is five years!"
"So, if for the next five years you are going to be paying $300 a month and I am trying to just do this in my head, but you are paying $300 a month times 60."
"You know, what is that car going to eventually cost you?"
"And I know right now interest rates are very low, but are you going to be satisfied with a car over five years."
"Because, what tends to happen with a lot of people when they finance for a long period of time"
like that is then when they get ready to trade their car in it is not worth what they owe for it.
So they are what we call upside down.
"And we talked about upside down in another chapter earlier in the book, but that means you owe more than it is worth."
"In it's a particular kind of hashing, called modular hashing."
It's just a particular way of computing a hash function.
"It's easiest to think about in terms of numbers, although it, it works in all kinds of situations."
"Because remember everything in a computer is encoded as a byte, which can be treated as bytes which could be treated as binary numbers."
And so what we are going to do is in this case We saw a pattern characters are decimal digits.
"And so, we'll treat a sequence of pattern characters as the decimal number."
"And modular hashing is, just take a big prime."
And compute the remainder when you divide your number by that prime.
"So in this case, 613 is the remainder that you get when you divide 26,535 by 997."
So you can check that.
So that's what we're going to use as the hash function.
And that.
This type of hashing is widely used.
"You have a prime number, we talked about it when we talked about hashing."
"It satisfies, it seems to satisfy something like the uniform hash assumption under various circumstances."
"So that's our pattern, a five character pattern, and we're going to keep the small hash values 613 and this is going to generalize to longer patterns, and we'll talk about that in a minute."
"So now, suppose we have this text."
And our pattern happens to occur here in the text.
And what the method is built on is the idea of you take the first five characters in the text and compute its hash value.
"In this case, 31,415, mod down 97, is 508."
So that's different so that's not the pattern.
"Maybe take the next five characters, that's 201."
That's diffent It's not the pattern.
Take the next one.
"That's 715, different it's not the pattern 15,926 by 97 is 971, it's not the pattern."
"Eventually, when you have the text characters that are the same as the pattern characters you're gonna get the same result, it's a match."
"If the pattern hat, hash equals the text sub-string hash you, you have the potential for a match."
And that's what the algorithm is based on.
"Now it seems like, we're doing a lot of calculation, with, making numbers out of these things."
"And, and keep doing modular arithmetic on it."
"But actually there's, a really, simple way to, severely limit the amount of calculation."
"And give a quick linear algorithm for, search."
"Finally, another definition that's important is marginal cost, which is the change in cost with a change in output."
"So the marginal cost is just like-- remember, we want to think in terms of marginal decision making in this course."
"So the marginal cost is the change in cost with the change in-- actually, that should be a little q."
The change in a firm's cost with the change in the firm's output is marginal cost.
"And then finally, average cost is just what it sounds like."
"Average cost is just c over q, it's just the average."
"So the difference between marginal and average cost, is basically average costs is the average over the whole set of goods produced."
Marginal cost is the cost of that next unit of production.
So those are our key definitions.
"Now with those in mind, let's ask how do we get costs?"
And the answer is we get them from the production function.
"Once we do a production function, we can derive costs."
"So if we have some production function, q equals f of I and k, then we can say the cost of producing q is equal to f of wl plus rk."
"Where w is the wage rate, or the rate you pay per unit of"
"labor, and r is the rental rate, or the rate you pay per unit of capital."
"Now, let me just pause here for a second to talk about pricing capital."
"It's easy to think the cost of an hour of labor, it's the wage you pay for an hour."
It's harder to think about the cost of a unit of capital.
"Because we buy the machines, right?"
So how do we think about the cost?
"I'm going to cover this later in the course, for now imagine all machines are rented."
Imagine you rent every machine you use.
And think of r as the rental price of that unit of capital.
"So with buildings it make sense, firms often rent the buildings they're in."
"Think of r as the rental price of that unit of building, or that unit of machine."
We'll come back later to see why that's a sensible way to think about it.
"The key point is, the reason we have to do this is the wage is a flow measure, every hour I pay you a new wage."
"If I use the cost of buying the machine, that be a stock measure, so you couldn't really compare it to wages."
So we want to use a flow measure.
The flow measures is what we have to pay every period to rent the machine.
Yeah?
AUDlENCE:
We want to go find things in some data set.
And I'll remind you that we sort of a separated out two cases.
"We said if we had an ordered list, we could use binary search."
"And we said that was log rhythmic, took log n time where n is the size of the list."
"If it was an unordered list, we were basically stuck with linear search."
Got to walk through the whole list to see if the thing is there.
So that was of order in.
"And then one of the things that I suggested was that if we could figure out some way to order it, and in particular, if we could order it in n log n time, and we still haven't done that, but if we could do that, then we said the complexity changed a little bit."
But it changed in a way that I want to remind you.
"And the change was, that in this case, if I'm doing a single search, I've got a choice."
"I could still do the linear case, which is order n or I could say, look, take the list, let's sort it and then search it."
"But in that case, we said well to sort it was going to take n"
"log n time, assuming I can do that."
"Once I have it sorted I can search it in log n time, but that's still isn't as good as just doing n."
"And this led to this idea of amortization, which is I need to not only factor in the cost, but how am I going to use it?"
"And typically, I'm not going to just search once in a list, I'm going to search multiple times."
"So if I have to do k searches, then in the linear case, I got to do order n things k times."
It's order k n.
"Whereas in the ordered case, I need to get them sorted, which is still n log n, but then the search is only log n."
I need to do k of those.
And we suggested well this is better than that.
This is certainly better than that. m plus k all times log n is in general going to be much better than k times n.
"It depends on n and k but obviously as n gets big, that one is going to be better."
"And that's just a way of reminding you that we want to think carefully, but what are the things we're trying to measure when we talk about complexity here?"
It's both the size of the thing and how often are we going to use it?
"And there are some trade offs, but I still haven't said how"
"I'm going to get an n log n sorting algorithm, and that's what I want to do today."
One of the two things I want to do today.
"To set the stage for this, let's go back just for a second to binary search."
At the end of the lecture I said binary search was an example of a divide and conquer algorithm.
Sort of an Attila the Hun kind of approach to doing things if you like.
"So let me say -- boy, I could have made a really bad political joke there, which I will forego, right."
"Just tell us whether you are her, or not.""*"
"*""We'll find out now.Vural, pass the bottle here.""*"
"*""Pour it on her."" *"

You casted upon me the vilest violenceand the heaviest injustice.
You soiled my life with your own filth.
You brutally pillaged the life of someone you didn't even know.
Now look into my eyes and say your lies.
What the world wanted to see was how you would react.
And you all have reacted with joy and resolve.
"You've shown that your power will not be intimidated by any power that they have, and that's the most important thing that's happened here this week."
Because everything that went on inside that building tried to convince me that I was alone and that I was weak.
They tried to convince me that I was like a little finger out there on my own that could easily be broken.
"And all of you out here where the reminder for all of us that I wasn't just a finger all alone in there, but that I was connected to hand with many fingers that could be united as one fist, and that that fist could not be broken by the power that they have in there."
That fist is not a symbol of violence.
That fist is a symbol that we will not be mislead into thinking we are alone.
We will not be lied to and told that we are weak.
We will not be divided and we will not back down.
That fist is a symbol that we are connected and that we are powerful.
It's a symbol that we hold true to our vision of a healthy and just world and we are building the self empowering movement to make it happen.
"All those authorities in there wanted me to think like a finger, but our children are calling to us to think like a fist."
"And we know that now I'll have to go prison, we know that now that is the reality."
But that's just the job that I have to do.
That's the role that I face.
And many before me have gone to jail for justice and if we're gonna achieve our vision many after me will have to join me as well.
[People shouting:
"""I'll join you"" , cheering]"
Nobody ever told us that this battle would be easy.
Nobody ever told us that we wouldn't have to make sacrifices.
We knew that when we started this fight.
"Every wave on the ocean that has ever risen up and refused to lay back down has been dashed on the shore, but it is the very purpose of a wave to rise up, because once it rises above the horizon it finally has the perspective to see that it's not just a wave, that it's a part of a mighty ocean."
[Cheering]
And you can just do a little Math to get to xi+1 you take.
"Xi, we don't care about the first digit anymore, so you subtract it off."
Multiply by r and then add the new digit.
That's like one step of Horner's method.
"Now, then you have to take that computation and you can do mod q all the way through."
All you have to do is pre-compute r to the n+1 mod q And so here's the computation for one example.
"If we're at this position 41592 and we know 41592 mod q we can compute 15926 mod q by subtracting off 40,000."
"The TiR-1 and that gives us just the four digits, multiply by the radix add the new trailing digit and that's the new value."
And if we just keep that all mod q then we can with just a multiply and an add at each step we can keep a running total of the Modular hash value of the five digit thing.
"So, for example, this is the case that, that we just did 4152 on 997 is, is done by ex, exactly as we said we subtract and then add and then multiply by the radix mod 997."
"So, doing those calculations all the way through the search, we eventually get to a match."
That's again remarkably small amount of code.
We're going to keep a long random prime.
Just keep it a little smaller than the biggest long value to avoid overflow.
So we pre-compute r to the m - one mod q
'cause that's the little calculation that we have to do.
We compute the hash function.
And for the pattern.
"And then, with those pre-computations, the search is extremely straight forward."
So we take our current hash value.
"And this is just, add a q make sure it's positive."
And subtract off rm times the first character in then add in the next character mod q.
And that gives us the text hash for the current position.
And then we compare to see if that's equal to the pattern hash.
Now there's this is an introduction to the idea of randomized algorithms.
There's two ways to proceed from here.
One way called Monte Carlo version.
"Where we guaratee that the algorithm is gonna be quick but with low probability, it might get the answer wrong."
In that version we don't ever bother to check whether the go through and check all digits to see if there's actually a match.
"We take queue large enough so that we're confident the probability of the, to, two digit numbers or two m digit numbers having the same hash value."
"And so low that we're not gonna worry about it, that's called the Monte Carlo version."
The Las Vegas version is guarateed to get the right answer.
The price-- I get nervous when I'm running out of time.
So I'm going to do this in the next video.
See you soon.
"So in this problem, we're going to try to build up a given row of Pascal's triangle."
"So you could solve this problem recursively, and that's what I did my first time, but I feel that the iterative solution is a bit simpler and more intuitive to understand."
"This isn't always the case, but this is how I'm going to explain this problem."
"What we're going to do is, we're going to start with a list that's row 1, and then we're going to build the next list by adding the 2 numbers above it."
"More precisely, let's say we're doing the last row, and we have the previous row already made, we're going to start an invisible 0 here, and we're going to say, 1 is going to be the sum of the 0 number that I just made up and the 1 that's the first element of the previous row."
"We're going to update our pointers to move over by 1, and we get to the element 4 by adding 1 and 3."
I'm going to repeat this process all the way through.
6 is 3 + 3.
4 is 3 + 1.
1 is 1 and 0.
"So that's pretty easy to explain, and that's basically how you would do it if you were building it out by hand, but putting it in a code may be a little bit more complicated and have alluded you."
So let's see how it's done.
So if I initialize the first row in the triangle to 1.
"We don't have anything for a result yet, so that's an empty list."
"I'm then going to iterate through the process of building each row 1 at a time, n times."
That way we can get to the nth row.
We're going to append the row that we just discovered onto the result list.
The first time around it will just be the list of 1 because that's how the triangle starts.
"We're then going to find the next row, which I haven't defined yet, and then repeat this process appending the current row onto the result list."
"Once we're done, we're going to return the result."
"So this is a good outline of what we're doing, but we're missing the most important part, and that is the makenextrow."
So a row is going to start as an empty list.
"As I had the 2 pointers before, we're going to have the previous one and then we're going to have one that I'm going to call e."
"So as I said in the description, we're going to start out with 0."
"That way when we add 1, we get 1, which is the sides of the triangle."
We're going to calculate the new entry in the current row by adding e--that's our right pointer--with the previous one that we start at 0 so that we get 1.
"We're going to update the values in previous and then the next iteration, e will update to the next value in row."
This last line basically includes the 1 on the right-hand side.
"Once we return result, triangle can use makenextrow accordingly, and we're done."
We know it's not a sink vertex cause we're assuming there aren't any.
So there's an outgoing arc so let's follow it.
"We get to some other node, by assumption there's no sink vertex so this isn't a sink vertex."
So there's an outgoing arc.
"So let's follow it, we get to some other node."
"That also has an outgoing arc, let's follow that, and so on."
So we just keep following outgoing arcs.
"And we do this as long as we want, because every vertex has at least one outgoing arc."
"Well, there's a finite number of vertices."
Right?
"This graph has, say, N vertices."
"So, if we follow N arcs, we're gonna see N plus one vertices."
"So, by the pigeon hold principle, we're gonna have to see a repeat."
Right?
"So, if N plus one vertices has only N distinct vertices, we're gonna see some vertex twice."
"So, for example, maybe after I take the outgoing arc from this vertex."
I get back to this one that I saw previously.
"Well, what have we done, what happens when we get a repeated vertex?"
By tracing these out going arcs and repeating a vertex we have exhibited a directed cycle.
And that's exactly what we're assuming doesn't exist.
We're talking about directed acyclic graphs.
"So, put differently, we just proved that a vertex with no sink vertex has to have a directed cycle."
So a directed acyclic graph therefore has to have at least one sink vertex.
"So, here's how we use this very simple observation now to compute a topological order of a directed acyclic graph."
Well let's do a little thought experiment.
Suppose in fact this graph did have a topological ordering.
Let's think about the vertex that goes last in this topological ordering.
"Remember, any arc which goes backward in the ordering is a violation."
So we have to avoid that.
We have to make sure that every arc goes forward in the ordering.
"Now, any vertex which has an outgoing arc, we better put somewhere other than in the final position, all right?"
"So the node that we put in the final position, all of its arcs are gonna wind up to all of its outgoing arcs are gonna wind up going backward in the topological ordering."
That adding to the back of the queue is easy.
"We saw how we did that with the stack, right, so that the End queue operation doesn't need that tail pointer and it already kind of wasn't a problem for us."
"Now, the D queue operation would mean, okay, using our tail pointer to know where the"
last close value is tells us it's ten.
"But we have the same problem I had pointed out with the stack, which is, we can get to this value, we can return this value, you know, we can delete this cell, but what we need to do, also, in the operation, update our tail pointer so a subsequent D queue can do its work efficiently."
"And it's that backing up of the tail pointer that is the sticky point that given that ten doesn't know who points into it, the single link list if very asymmetric that way."
"But you only know what's follows you, not what proceeds, but backing up this pointer is not easy."
"It involves the reversal of going back to the beginning, walking your way down to find somebody who points to the last [inaudible]."
So it seems like this tail pointer didn't buy us a lot.
"It helped a little bit, you know, to get some of the operation up and running, but in the end, keeping and maintaining that tail pointer sort of came back to bite us."
"In the case of the Strategy A, the tail pointer gives us immediate access to the back, which we're going to need for the end queue."
"If I go to end queue of 40, in this case, then what I'm going to need to do is make a new cell, attach it off of the current cell, and then update the tail, right, to point to that cell while that update's moving forward down the list, right."
"If you're on the third cell and you add a fourth cell, you need to move the tail from the third to the fourth."
Moving that direction's easy.
It's the backing up where we got into trouble.
"So in fact, this suggests that Strategy A is the one we can make both these operations manipulate in constant time in a way that this one got us into trouble."
I think we can do it.
Let's switch it over.
I've got an empty queue here.
"Also, it is empty in size."
"This is the same problem with size, which is either you have to go count them or you have to cache the size."
"I will build the same exactly structure, in fact."
"Now, I'll type next."
It's going to have both a head and a tail pointer so we can keep track of the two ends we've got going.
I think I'm missing my [inaudible].
Slip over.
Okay.
"And then I will make the same comment here about, yeah, you need to delete all cells."
So I set the head and the tail to null.
"I'm now in my empty state that tells me I've got nothing in the queue, nothing at all, so far."
And my Y is empty.
Oh.
Eat me!
"Calm down, dad will be back soon"
"Ok well it seems like your dad's going to leave us without food again you're wrong Federica -dad, dad. come on did you bring us fish this time, dad? erm, fish? no, well I found a few but they were all wet and full of bones what's more, seen as you kids have always loved coconuts I decided to bring you coconuts coconuts? for 4 years now since the plane crashed the only thiong we've eaten is coconuts don't lie Junior, we've also had coconut milk, coconut skin and the house speciality 'crazy coconut on the beach' hey dad...."
"Ludiquito, you're dad's not as stupid as you think this time I just stabbed myself in the foot with the... good at least your dad can say he's stabbed something on this island arg I hate being here don't start this again, saying you want to leave the island"
"-get used to the good life, -the good life?! give me 3 good things about life on this island that I don't have to wash, I don't have to go to work, and our marriage is better than ever better? what are you on about? how long has it been since we've argued about leaving the toilet seat up yes because now you just pee like a dog under palm trees and it still gets to that you walk around in pee-soaked sandals ok but it's been ages since I've complained about you emitting toxic gases in the night yes because we pretty much sleep outside and the wind blows them away excuses, excuses, I can't make you happy with anything plus, you take for granted that I'm giving you all you ever wanted... to live by the beach ahh yes on the beach, but on a civilised beach idiot, in Puerto Vallarta or Xtapa"
I miss banana boats and paragliding and here there's no bananas and definitely no Paragliding well how's it fault that we landed on this island? don't you remember whose fault it is that we're here?
-Nacho doesn't live here -sorry
-who is it?
"-Capitan, the kids are here to see the cabin come on in here are the kids Capitan"
"Welcome to the cabin my little friends, do any of you have any questions?"
How high up are we?
"We are flying at 36,000 feet kids' feet or adults' feet? -he snook in - any other questions, kids? and this screen with little lights on it, what's it for? it's the main computer which controls all the plane's systems"
"-and it's fizzy-pop proof? -no, it's not fizzy-pop proof who's smart idea was it to ask that? the idiot's who spilt his pop on it it was only a little bit... and it was diet! well anyone could have spilt that you didn't drop a drink, stupid, you dropped a plane with 95 passengers well yes but it doesn't count  because nobody died plus they were all cowards who decided  to run away instead of forming 'Ludovic-Land' with us we should have done the same and gone to the other side of the island to get help but why if they never came back? they were probably eaten by cannibals!"
I don't think there's cannibals on the other side
"Bibi, why wouldn't there be cannibals on the other side, if there's actors on the other side modistos., even politicians. why wouldn't there be cannibals on the other side?"
Why aren't you a normal castaway girl?
"But dad, seriously, you have to get us off of this island, now! -yes -yeah ok ok I promise I'll have a plan before nightfall, a plan to get away from here this is the plan, look."
"ludoviquito, shut up with your drum hurry up dad, tell us the plan!"
"look, the plan is to wait until a Russian submarine goes by, one of the old-fashioned ones when they stick the peroscope out  ludoviquito is going to smash the viewing glass with a stone and then they'll have to get out to repair it, AND WHlLE THEY DO THAT..."
Junior will distract them dressed as a woman and while he gives them a lap dance...
"I'll get in and nick an atomic bomb, which is when you'll enter Federica you'll talk to ... and say 'gentlemen, we have kidnapped your atomic bomb' and then they'll send us a raft/wooden boat to get off the island and you'll drive the submarine in circles until it runs out of petrol and blows up into millions of pieces how's that? wow what a great plan! or we could just wait for the sea to freeze over and we could skate off ahh, how did I not think of that? oii dad, and if the sea freezes can I skate off dressed as a woman? kids, will you give me a minute with your dad?"
(Right) Now!
"Ludovico P.Luche, we can't stay here! what will we eat when the coconuts run out? -have you thought about the kids? -eat the kids? what a brute! think about them, about what's happening, the poor things"
Ludoviquito for example now has...
"-Pelicans! -now he has his first few chin hairs he's a teenager now, and Bibi has grown... coconuts, the coconuts have run out already."
Now what are going to eat?
"I don't know, ask your dad -Dad, what are we going to eat? ask your dad, you're adopted remember"
"Ludovico, Ludovico -yes, I heard."
"It's the... again what do we do? -......... no, don't worry. sleep, I'll keep watch."

History.
The Herald.
"""The Herald"" was started on 3 January 1840 by George Cavanaugh as ""The Port Phillip Herald"". In 1855, it became ""The Melbourne Herald"", but a week later became ""The Herald"". From 1869, it was an evening newspaper. Colonel William Thomas Reay was sometime literary editor and later associate editor, before becoming managing editor in 1904."
The Sun News-Pictorial.

The merger.
"""The Herald"" once sold almost 600,000 copies, but by the time of its 150th anniversary in 1990 it had fallen below 200,00. This was caused by the impact of evening television news and more people using cars to get home from work.'This was much less than that of the morning ""Sun""."
"As a result, The Herald and Weekly Times decided to merge the two, and so after one hundred and fifty years, ten months and two days of publication, ""The Herald"" was published for the last time as a separate newspaper on 5 October 1990. The next day, ""The Sun News-Pictorial"" published its last edition. The Sunday editions of the two newspapers had already been merged. The resulting newspaper had both the size and style of ""The Sun News-Pictorial""."
"With sales still falling, the afternoon edition was cancelled, the last edition being published on December 21, 2001. The News Limited now produces ""mX"" a free afternoon paper that can be picked up from stands throughout the Melbourne CBD. It is not available outside that area."

Organolithium reagent
"Organolithium compounds contain a direct bond between a carbon atom and a lithium atom. They are an important class of organometallic compound. The bonding between the carbon and lithium is highly polar due to the difference in electronegativity between these atoms, which effectively makes the carbon negatively charged and capable of acting as a strong base or nucleophile. These compounds are similar to Grignard reagents, but are much more reactive. Organolithium reagents such as butyllithium are widely commercially available. Due to their highly reactive nature, they must be handled under a protective atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon as they will catch fire in air."

"Fall Branch, Tennessee"
"Fall Branch is a census-designated place (CDP) in Washington and Greene counties in the U.S. state of Tennessee. The population was 1,291 at the 2010 census. Some areas in Sullivan also use the Fall Branch ZIP code."
History.
"One of the earliest settlers at Fall Branch was Isaac White. He was a Revolutionary War veteran who arrived in the area in 1781. He eventually established a farm at what is now the intersection of Interstate 81 and State Highway 93. Another early settler, Gabriel Morgan, built a grist mill at Fall Branch in the early 1800s. The mill stood until the 1930s, when it was torn down."
"By the early 1800s, Fall Branch was known as ""Crouch Town"", after a family of early settlers. The name had changed to ""James' Cross Roads"" by 1830, when a post office was established. The name ""Falls Branch"" had been adopted by 1854, and the ""s"" was dropped from ""Falls"" in 1883, giving the community its current name. The name was inspired by the waterfall the community's main creek, also called Fall Branch, spills over just before it empties into Horse Creek."
"In 1836, Fall Branch was designated as the county seat of the proposed ""Powell County"", which would have consisted of parts of Washington, Greene, Sullivan, and Hawkins counties. While voters approved of the new county, it was rejected by the Tennessee Supreme Court on the grounds that it failed to meet the minimum size required by the state constitution for new counties."
Schools.
"A school, Fall Branch Seminary, was established at Fall Branch in 1842. Fall Branch High School, initially a two-year school, was established before 1900. The high school was consolidated with several other smaller schools to form Daniel Boone High School in nearby Gray in 1971."

History.
"According to the Thalon text, Pureiromba () was one of the 5 gods of 5 different places of the Selloi Langmai Hill (Nongmaiching Hill). Before the Meitei King Ura Konthouba (c. 7th century CE) killed all the Selloi Langmai people, the cults of these five gods were put together into that of a single God with the name ""Langmai Ningthou"" (lit. ""King of the Langmais""). The personal names became the other names or various forms of the God. With this, the tribal society of the Selloi Langmai people became one chiefdom. This chiefdom later became the Angom clan."
Description.

"Quorn, South Australia"
"Quorn is a small town in the Flinders Ranges in the north of South Australia, 39 km northeast of Port Augusta. In 2011 there were 1206 people living in Quorn. Quorn is the home of the Flinders Ranges Council local government area. It is in the state Electoral district of Stuart and the federal Division of Grey."
It is also the home of the Pichi Richi Railway.
History.
"The town was surveyed in 1878 and named after Quorndon in Leicestershire, United Kingdom. It was a railway town, part of the railway line being built from Port Augusta. The railway line from Port Augusta to Quorn opened in 1879. It reached Government Gums (Farina) in 1882, Marree in 1884, Oodnadatta in 1890 and Alice Springs in 1929. This railway line later became known as the ""Ghan line"" or Central Australia Railway."
"In 1917, Quorn became the crossroads of the north–south Central Australian Railway and east–west Trans-Australian Railway between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie. This made Quorn an important town, as everyone travelling east–west or north–south in Australia passed through Quorn. As a result, many fine buildings were built as the town expanded."
"Quorn's role as a crossroads was lost in 1937 when a standard gauge railway connection was opened between Port Pirie and Port Augusta. However, during World War II, Quorn was a vital service point for trains heading north to Alice Springs. Over one million soldiers passed through on their way to Darwin and on to Papua New Guinea. There were over 50 trains eaxh day during and immediately after World War II. The trains also carried coal mined at Leigh Creek to the new Playford A Power Station in Port Augusta."
"During the 1950s a new standard gauge line was built which did not pass through Quorn. It was built on the western side of The Dutchmans Stern, Mount Arden and Mount Eyre. This line went from Stirling North to Brachina and then followed the original narrow gauge route through Leigh Creek and to Marree. Trains no longer went through the Pichi Richi Pass or Quorn. The only services now operating through Quorn was freight from Peterborough and Hawker. As a result Quorn lost its important railway business and in the 1980s the railway was completely closed as freight was moved to road transport. One unusual aspect of the railway working from Peterborough to Quorn and then on to Hawker was the need for the engine to be turned and joined to the opposite end of the train when arriving at Quorn, as it was not a ""through"" station for the trip from Peterborough to Hawker."
"In 1973 the Pichi Richi Railway Preservation Society was formed to keep and protect the unique bridges and stone work that formed the railway through the Pichi Richi Pass between Quorn and Stirling North. At first they only wanted to preserve the railway through the Pichi Richi Pass, but they later got railway carriages and locomotives to provide a tourist service through from Quorn to Port Augusta. TheThey have written a book showing the railway in its heyday."
Tourism.
"A main attraction in Quorn is the Pichi Richi Railway. There are also a self-guided walking tours in the town, included several based around the town's historic old buildings, the railway yards and other historic locations. The Flinders Ranges Visitor Information Centre / Pichi Richi Railway in the Quorn railway station provide visitor information, bookings for the railway, accommodation, tours and souvenirs."

Student leaders.
"Sir Richard Timothy Hunt , (born 19 February 1943 in Neston, Cheshire), is an English biochemist. He is usually known as Tim Hunt."
Hunt shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on cell division.
The prize was shared with Paul Nurse and Leland H. Hartwell. They had discovered the molecules which control cell division.
"Cyclins are proteins that play a key role in regulating the cell-division cycle. Hunt found that cyclins begin to be synthesised after eggs are fertilised. He also found that cyclins are present in vertebrate cells, where they also regulate the cell cycle."
Early life.
"At the age of eight he was accepted into the Dragon School, where he first developed an interest in biology thanks to his German teacher, Gerd Sommerhoff."
"When he was fourteen he moved to Magdalen College School, Oxford, where the science prizes now bear his name."
Career.
"In 1961, Hunt was accepted into Clare College, Cambridge to study natural sciences, graduating in 1964 and immediately beginning work in the university Department of Biochemistry."
"He finished his PhD in 1968 and went to New York to work on protein synthesis. Tiny amounts of glutathione inhibited protein synthesis in reticulocytes (immature red blood cells), and tiny amounts of RNA killed the synthesis altogether. After returning to Cambridge he continued work on substances which started or inhibited protein synthesis."
"In 1982 at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, he used the sea urchin (""Arbacia punctulata"") egg as his model organism. He discovered the cyclin molecule."
Hunt found that cyclins are present in vertebrate cells where they regulate the cell cycle. His group showed that cyclins bind and activate a family of protein kinases. One of these had been identified as a crucial cell cycle regulator by Paul Nurse.
"In 1990 he began work at Imperial Cancer Research Fund. In 2001 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Leland Hartwell and Paul Nurse for their work on cell division. Other honours followed, and he was knighted by the Queen in 2006."
Personal life.
Hunt is married to Mary Collins. The couple have two daughters.

Stratosphere
"The stratosphere is one of the layers of the atmosphere of the planet Earth. It extends from about 8 km above the poles (18 km above the equator) to about 50 km. In the stratosphere, the temperature rises with increasing height. This makes the stratosphere very stable. This temperature gradient is caused by the ozone layer which absorbs some UV radiation from sunlight. The absorbed radiation is converted to heat."
"This differs from the lower layer, the troposphere, where temperature declines with higher altitude, and from the next higher layer, the mesosphere, where the temperature again declines."
"Airplanes that are going far usually fly in the lower stratosphere, because the engines are more efficient in cold air and drag is small in low air density air."

Match fixing
"Match fixing, in organized sports, occurs as a match is played to an entirely or partly pre-determined result. This violates the rules of the game and often the law. The most common reason is to get a payoff from gamblers."
"The major motivations behind match fixing are gambling and the future team advantage. In Eastern Europe, mafia gangsters are linked to illegal gambling and match fixing. In Russia, people have disappeared or died after acting against bribes in sports."
"Many sports have tournaments where the result of one round determines tFheir opponent in the next. By losing a match, a certain team can face an easier opponent in the next round. This makes them much more likely to win."
Sports betting
"Sports betting is the activity of predicting sports and placing wagers on the outcome. Some suggest bets were placed for the first time in Ancient Greece, while others insist there is evidence of similar betting activities even before that."
"The frequency of sports that is bet upon differs with culture. Most of those bets are placed on basketball, baseball, mixed martial arts, boxing and auto racing at both professional and amateur levels."
"In many parts of the United States, sports betting is illegal. It is legal in several other states. They include Iowa, New York, Rhode Island, Colorado and Nevada. In countries like Australia, New Zealand, and Sweden sports betting winnings are not taxed. Other jurisdictions, like Germany, impose taxes on wagering profits, but naturally the percentage varies from one country to another."
Sports betting can be done on several Internet websites or in public.

But through a Mongolian who contacted Islamic culture did this kind of alcoholic beverage and the distillation techniques of making such a drink come about to the East."
"As soju became prevalent throughout Won Dynasty of China, it eventually spread throughout Korea Kingdom, where it became so popular that numerous kinds of soju were created. Because soju created at that time were made from pure grains, it was very tasty and clean. It was also not so strong. However, it was very expensive simply because it was distilled."

"The legend of the nation's birth is that Jumong was born out of an egg and brought up by King Gumwa () of East Buyeo. The name, Jumong, means a person who is good at archery. Because of his archery skills, Prince Daeso () envied him. So, Jumong felt death threats and decided to escape from East Buyeo with three friends. He went to Jolbon Buyeo and married Sosuno () who was the princess of the nation. Jumong succeeded the king and changed the nation's name to Goguryeo after his surname."
"Since the first king, King Dongmyeong (), Goguryeo had been invaded by several enemies such as the Chinese Han Dynasty, and Xianbei.

Webster-Hayne debate
"The Webster-Hayne debate was a famous debate in the United States between Senator Daniel Webster of Massachusetts and Senator Robert Y. Hayne of South Carolina. It happened on January 19-27, 1830. It was about protectionist tariffs. The speeches between Webster and Hayne themselves were not planned. They had burst forth from arguments about a decision by Connecticut Senator Samuel Foote. Foote had temporarily stopped land surveying until land already on the market was sold. Webster's ""Second Reply to Hayne"" (1830) was widely seen as ""the most eloquent speech ever delivered in Congress."""
"Webster described the US government as ""made for the people, made by the people, and answerable to the people"". This influenced Abraham Lincoln later. He spoke the words ""government of the people, by the people, for the people"" in his Gettysburg Address."
Point Hicks
"Point Hicks, once called Cape Everard, is a coastal headland on the east coast of Victoria, Australia. It is now a part of the Croajingolong National Park."
Name.
"Point Hicks is where, on 19 April 1770, the continent of Australia was first sighted by the men on Captain Cook's ""Endeavour"" voyage. Cook wrote that it was Lieutenant Zachary Hickes who first saw land, and Cook named the point after him. Hickes spelt his name with an ""e"", Cook wrote both ""Hicks"" and ""Hickes"" in different places. The spelling ""Hicks"" is now in use for the point."
"When George Bass sailed past the area at the end of 1797 he did not locate the point. It did not appear on the charts Matthew Flinders made of their voyages, and the name fell into disuse."
"The point came to be known as Cape Everard. The first use of that name is said to be by hydrographer John Lort Stokes who surveyed the coast in the ""Beagle"" in 1843. It is thought he named it after fellow naval officer John Everard Home, but his maps do not use the name."
"The first map showing Cape Everard was by surveyor George Douglas Smythe, made in 1852 and published in 1853. If he thought of the name, he may have named it after William Everard, commissioner of crown lands."
The name Cape Everard was used until 1970. There has been doubt and arguments about exactly what Cook saw. The actual latitude and longitude he gave () is a location many miles out to sea.
"Point Hicks was renamed as part of Cook's bicentenary. Victorian Premier Henry Bolte announced the new name in a ceremony at the point on 20 April 1970 (this was the 200th anniversary; Cook's 19 April was by nautical time, i.e. not adjusted for the International Date Line)."
Lighthouse.
"A lighthouse was built on the point in 1887/8 and started operation in 1890. It was built from concrete and with wooden lighthouse keepers houses. It was connected to mains electricity in 1965, and then to solar power recently. The keepers' cottages are today used as holiday houses. With 37 metres of height it is the tallest lighthouse on Australia's mainland. Its light is a double white flash every ten seconds, from a height of 56 metres above sea level."

Gülen condemns terrorism, supports communication between people of different religions, and has initiated such dialogue with the Vatican and some Jewish organisations. Until 2013 he was an ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who later blamed him for the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt. He operates a worldwide organisation called the Gülen Movement also known as FETÖ."
Teachings.
"Fethullah Gülen's attitude towards hijab has changed over time. In the past, Gülen, who regarded the unwinding of even a strand of women's hair as a great sin, suggested that women should cover their whole body by using veils and gloves. In his last speeches, Gülen evaluated the headscarf as a füruat (minor details)."
"For Fethullah Gülen, to allow views opposed to belief in creation is a devastating delusion and evolution, a Darwin fallacy."
"According to Gülene, the creation of Adam as the first human and Eve from Adam's file bone are miracle creations that should not be addressed in the context of cause-effect relationship."

In 1948 Funatsu Village and Shin-Yokoe Village became a part of Sabae Town. Since then Sabae Town was gradually growing until it became Sabae City.
"Gozaemon Masunaga, the ""ancestor of domestic eyeglasses,"" started  manufacturing eyewear frames in Fukui around 1905. At that time, most people in Sabae were working in the farming industry. Farming was challenging in winter, since the Fukui region experiences a lot of snow.  Masunaga started this industry because the eyeglass industry does not depend on the season. He invited craftsmen from Osaka to try to spread the industry as a side business of a farmer in Fukui. At that time, education and the development of printing technology were spreading so people started to read prints such as newspapers. The demand for eyewear has expanded. In 1935, the eyewear industry spread to Sabae and Fukui. The industry succeeded in manufacturing the titanium-based eyewear frames in 1981 for the first time in the world. After that, a large military factory was converted to an eyewear factory after the end of World War II made Sabae’s eyeglasses industry famous."
Edo period.
"From the beginning Sabae was ruled by Manabe Clan. The Sabae area used to be the gate town of Jōshō Temple. In the Edo period, the West-Sabae Jin'ya (administrative headquarter for a small province) was under the direct control of the Shogunate. At that time, Sabae was the gate town until 1871. In meantime Sabae Jin'ya became Sabae Han (historical term for the estate of a daimyo in the Edo period) (1720-1871)"
"Manabe Akikatsu (1804-1884) is known as the most famous Sabae's feudal lord, who in 1856 opened Kyōyōkei - a place where the lords can relax. Kyōyōkei was the foundation of the current Nishiyama Park."
"When Sabae became Han there was a plan to build a castle. However, the Sabae Castle was never built. There were many problems such as financial difficulties and the occurrence of famine. Instead, Manabe Akikatsu took the money that was meant for the castle and gave it to the villages that were suffering from famine."

"The kererū (""Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae"") is the only type of pigeon native to New Zealand. It is very big and easy to spot, and its wings make a loud sound when it flies. It is the only still-living New Zealand bird which can eat large fruits whole, and so is important for spreading the seeds of many native trees. Kererū were an important type of food for Māori. There are much fewer kererū now than before the Europeans arrived in New Zealand, mostly because the Europeans brought meat-eating animals like cats, ferrets, stoats, possums, and rats, and cut down a lot of the forest. Because there are not many kererū any more, it is against the law to hunt them."
Name.
"'Kererū' is the most common name for this bird, but in some parts of the North Island it is called ""kūkū"" or ""kūkupa."" Kererū are also called ""wood pigeon"", but they are a different type of bird to the wood pigeon (""Columba palumbus"") of the Northern Hemisphere."
Description.
"Kererū are big and generally weigh between 550 and 850 grams. They have a white underbelly and dark green/blue head, shoulders, and wings. The green/blue colour is iridescent, meaning it is shiny and shows lots of different blues, greens, and purples in the sunlight."
Henotheism
"Henotheism is the adherence to one particular god out of several, especially by a family, tribe, or other group."
"Henotheism is sometimes defined as a monotheistic belief within a polytheistic world - believing that one god, or articulation of God, is better or clearer than others. Alternatively, henotheism is the worship of one god above an acknowledged pantheon. An example of this second form is the worship of a tribal god."
A henotheist would admit that many gods have real existence and are able to be worshipped. However the henotheist chooses to worship only one of these gods. This sets the henotheist apart from the polytheist who worships many gods.

Risks.
"Bulimia nervosa can cause many health problems. Because vomit has lots of acid in it, purging frequently can burn the person's mouth, throat, or teeth. One can lose nutrients or fluids in their body. Glands in one's throat and face may get larger and hurt. The immune system is weakened, as well as the possibility of muscle or heart problems."
Sometimes bulimia can cause difficulty breathing. This is because the acids that are in your mouth go to your lungs and damage the bronchioles. There is also feedback to the ego and a social stigma that may cause further psychological impact.
Statistics.
Most people who have bulimia are between the ages of 10 to 25. It is more common in females than it is in males. People who have had past trauma are more likely to be bulimic. People with obsessive compulsive disorder or perfectionism are also likely to have bulimia.

Lineal championship
"In combat sports where champions are decided by a challenge, the lineal championship of a weight class is a world championship title held initially by an undisputed champion and subsequently by a fighter who defeats the reigning champion in a match at that weight class. In professional boxing, the lineal champion is informally called ""the man who beat the man""."
"Champions recognized by sanctioning bodies such as the World Boxing Association (WBA), World Boxing Council (WBC), or the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) may vacate their title voluntarily, or be stripped of the title for breaching the sanctioning body's regulations or contracts. There will thus be a breach of continuity in the list of sanctioned champions which the lineal championship is intended to prevent. However, there is no single canonical list of lineal champions at any weight class, because there is no agreed upon method of determining the starting point for each lineage and conflicting opinions on what to do when the current champion retires or moves to a different weight class, although there is agreement that any stripping of a title be discounted."
ASMR
"Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR, sometimes auto sensory meridian response) is a tingling sensation. It often starts on the scalp, and moves down the back of the neck and upper spine.

Economic changes.
"Britain began ruling its trading colonies in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. The British Empire now extended all over the world. It used new technologies like the railways and electric telegraph to communicate across these regions. Many British citizens moved to the colonies to make their fortune."
"Industrialisation brought with it a rapidly growing middle class. They were not aristocrats and landowners, but on the other hand they were not unskilled workers. They were the people who created, managed and ran the new industrial factories."
Social changes.
"In the Victorian era, the middle class people owned their own houses. The family home often included three generations. The concept of ""privacy"" became a mark of the middle class life. What went on in those homes was the themes of many mid-century novelists."
"The printing press became faster in the nineteenth century and paper was cheaper too. The ""taxes on knowledge"" on newspapers and printed advertisements were lifted. This made magazines and newspapers cheaper. The government tried to improve literacy rates by starting schools for the poor. More books were written for, and read by, the newly educated middle classes."
Entertainment.
"More theatres opened in London. Orchestras and symphonies played, and operas were widely attended. Gambling at cards and new casinos became popular during the period. In the middle of the 19th century saw The Great Exhibition of 1851, the first World's Fair, and showed the greatest creations of the century."
De-Stalinization
De-Stalinization is the way that the Soviet Union tried to undo Joseph Stalin's politics and the heroic image he created of himself using propaganda.
"After Stalin died, a group led the Soviet Union for a while. Georgi Malenkov was the Premier of the Soviet Union; Lavrentiy Beria, head of the Ministry of the Interior; and Nikita Khrushchev was First Secretary of the Central Committee."
"Because Stalin had so prominent a control over the Soviet Union, he was placed on a pedestal both at home and among communists abroad. In the years 1953–1955, a period of ""silent de-Stalinization"" took place, as the revision of Stalin's policies was done in secret, and often with no explanation."
Revisionism.
"In 1954, Nikita Khrushchev became the leader of the Soviet Union. He attempted to reform the Soviet government and change how socialism in the country should be ran. In order to do this, he had to change the way the public thought of Stalin, this is called revisionism. He removed Stalin's corpse out of the mausoleum in Red Square and he changed the name of Stalingrad (which was named after Stalin) to Volgograd. Some people disliked Khrushchev’s reform and those who oppose revisionism are called anti-revisionist."

"The capital city, Road Town, is on Tortola, one of the islands in the group. Most of the people live on Tortola, but the other main inhabited islands include Anegada, Virgin Gorda and Jost Van Dyke."
History.
"The islands were originally lived in by Caribbean Indians called Arawaks. By the time the first European explorers discovered the British Virgin Islands all of the Arawaks had left. The first Europeans to try and settle in the British Virgin Islands were the Dutch, but the English came soon after and the English and the Dutch settlers used to fight. The Spanish also claimed the islands, but no Spanish people ever tried to settle there. But the Spanish did attack the British and Dutch settlers."
In 1672 the British took control of the islands during a war against the Dutch and they have held on to them ever since.
"During the early years after European settlement the British Virgin Islands was a plantation economy which relied heavily upon slave labour. After slavery was abolished in the British Virgin Islands there was a long period of decline and many people left. Those who remained were mostly descended from African slaves, although many of them also left to try and find better lives elsewhere."

Byner immediately became an assistant coach after his playing days were over."
Generic drug
"A generic drug is a drug that uses the same active ingredients than another drug, which is already on the market. This second drug often uses a brand name. The German company Bayer developed an analgesic based on acetylsalicylic acid in the late 19th century. It marketed the drug as ""Aspirin"". The drug is no longer under copyright, and anyone can produce a drug with the same active substances, but they may not call that drug Aspirin, because that is a trade name. Very often, such drugs are marketed with the name of the main active substance, and the name of the company producing the drug. In most cases generic drugs are cheaper to buy than the branded alternatives."
Super Bowl XXV
Super Bowl XXV was the 25th Super Bowl played. It was between the New York Giants and Buffalo Bills. New York beat Buffalo 20-19.

Book of Enoch
"The Book of Enoch is a book claiming to be written by Enoch. He was the great-grandfather of Noah and son of Jared in the Bible. However, scholars consider it to be Pseudepigrapha. It is not part of the Bible canon and only the Ethiopian Orthodox Church says it is part of the Bible. The Book is an old Hebrew text, likely written in the 2nd century BC, and contains material on the origins of demons and giants, why some angels fell from heaven, an explanation of why Noah's Flood was morally necessary, and a description of the thousand-year reign of the Messiah. It is interesting to many Christians because the ninth verse of the first chapter is quoted in the Epistle of Jude 1:14-15."

When the carnival was not active, he played organ in burlesque houses. He then worked as a police photographer in San Francisco, though this has been questioned."
Church of Satan.
"In the 1960s, LaVey began giving lectures at his house to a group of people he called his ""Magic Circle."" A member of this Circle told him that his ideas could become a religion. He agreed, and founded the Church of Satan in 1966. In 1969, he published ""The Satanic Bible"". ""The Satanic Bible"" was a collection of writings he had published in the past years that outlined his philosophies and the basics of the religion. It was influenced by Ayn Rand, Friedrich Nietzsche, H. L. Mencken, and other authors and philosophers. In 1971, LaVey published ""The Compleat Witch"" (later released as ""The Satanic Witch""). ""The Satanic Witch"" was a manual of magic. In 1972, LaVey published ""The Satanic Rituals"". This contained instructions for performing rituals.

It was the sixth-costliest Atlantic hurricane in U.S. history. Hurricane Ike was the ninth named storm, fifth hurricane, third major hurricane and the most-intense hurricane of 2008 in terms of pressure. Ike may have caused up to 195 deaths. Most deaths happened in Haiti and the U.S. together. Haiti was still recovering from Tropical Storm Fay, Hurricane Gustav, and Hurricane Hanna."
Storm history.
"The storm that eventually became Hurricane Ike started near the west coast of Africa on August 28. The storm grew quickly as it moved to the west-northwest. On September 1, the storm formed into Tropical Depression Nine when the storm was over the central Atlantic Ocean. Later that day Tropical Depression Nine became Tropical Storm Ike."
After the storm.
"In spring 2009, the name ""Ike"" was retired due to severe damage it caused, particularly in Texas. It was replaced by ""Isaias"" for the 2014 season."
"Ayden is located at (35.470973, -77.420740)."
"According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land."
History.
"In 1891, William Henry Harris asked the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad to build a railroad depot on a portion of his farm in order to create a village. A parcel of land was divided into residential lots surrounding the depot in ""Harristown"". Harris owned every other lot in Harristown. Within the next several years, lots were sold and homes were built. Businesses began to open up to support the new residents, and on February 3, 1891, people in the town created a local government as ""Ayden."" Within a few years, the Carolina Christian College and the Free Will Baptist Seminary were established. By 1919, Ayden had full-time electricity supplied by the Ayden municipal light plant. In 1922, the Mutual Building and Loan Association of Ayden was organized to help families obtain mortgages (or loan) to build homes in Ayden."
"After experiencing tough times during the Great Depression, and after the Second World War, the town began to grow. As the town got bigger, they made commercial, cultural, religious, and other establishments within and around Ayden. The community is still growing today, thanks to the continued development of Greenville. Because Greenville is an industrial and economic center for eastern North Carolina."
The Ayden Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.

Strokkur
"Strokkur is a geyser in Iceland. It is located in the geothermal region near the Hvítá River, east of the capital Reykjavík."
History.
"Strokkur's activity began in 1789 following an earthquake. Strokkur continued to :wikt:erupt until 1896, when another earthquake blocked the geyser's water pipeline."
Tourism.
Strokkur is famous throughout Iceland and regularly attracts many tourists. People go there to see the geyser erupt.
Sequence of the eruption.
"The water present at a depth of 23 meters has a temperature of about 120 ° C, but cannot transform into a gaseous state due to the high pressure, due to the overlying mass of water. When this water reaches 16 meters deep, a certain amount can reach the boiling point and this induces the chain reaction that we see."
Miquelot de Prades
"Miquel de Prades ( Balaguer ) ? 1462? - Belvedere Marittimo coast 1505), known by the name of Miquelot de Prades, was a Catalan soldier famous for his skill with the sword and various military deeds. There is no certain evidence that confirms whether three documented facts (about a fencer, about a murderer and about a soldier who died at sea) can be attributed to the same person."
Documented facts.
Assassination of Joan Borja in Rome.
"The historian Jerónimo Zurita explains the assassination of Juan de Borja, son of Alexander VI in Rome, in the year 1497. The death was attributed to Michalot de Prats, who was at the service of the victim."
Famous fencer in Italy and Montserrat.
"Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés, in his work ""Las Quinquagenas de la nobility de España"", spoke of a Catalan soldier (Michalot de Pradas) who roamed Italy, winning all the duels with a sure thrust to the opponent's neck. Repentant of his life, that soldier went to take refuge in the monastery of Montserrat. One bad day an Italian soldier with two swords showed up and challenged Miquelot (saying that he wanted to see the secret thrust, claiming that he would know how to counter it). Miquelot flatly refused to fight but the other's insistence forced him to do so. The Italian ended up dead, with a thrust to the neck. There was probably no better way to teach it. Repentant of the new death, he went to Rome to ask for forgiveness. The pope incorporated him into his troops."
Soldier at the service of the Pontiff.
"There is a Michalot de Prats who with an armed caravel in Naples chased and made some corsairs flee near Belvedere Marittimo (a priori, without any relationship, with the previous events). Michalot's ship, some ships that accompanied him and the captured privateers suffered a sudden storm and sank (year 1505). All the crew were drowned."

Hades
"Hades (, ""Háidēs"") is the god of the dead and the king of the underworld in ancient Greek religion and myth. He is the eldest son of the Titans Kronos and Rhea and brother to Zeus, Poseidon, Hestia, Hera, Demeter and Chiron."
"As the lord of the dead, Hades was greatly feared by the Greeks, and he had few temples or shrines dedicated to him. He was married to the goddess Persephone, the daughter of Zeus and Demeter. Hades’ symbols were the cornucopia, a sceptre, the cypress, narcissus, poplar and his Helm of Darkness; the screech owl was his sacred animal. His sacred fruit was the pomegranate, the fruit that Persephone ate one- third of when she was kidnapped and in the underworld."
"Hades’ Roman equivalent was Pluto, whose name is merely a Latinization of the Greek ""Plouton""."
Superlative
"A superlative, in grammar, is an adjective describing a noun that is the best example of a given quality. In other words, a superlative describes a noun that has more of some quality than any other."
Some examples:
"In English, most superlatives can be formed by adding -EST to an existing adjective, like the examples above. (For adjectives that end in ""-y"", like ""crazy"", you often change the ""y"" to an ""i"" before you add the -EST on the end.)"
"Some adjectives have irregular superlative forms, which do not follow the rules, such as far (""farthest"") and bad (""worst"")."
"Other adjectives have no superlative form at all, and the superlative is made simply by adding the adverb ""most"" before the adjective. For instance, you do not say ""funnest,"" or ""interestingest"". Instead, you say ""most fun,"" and ""most interesting."""
"This way of making the superlative is used for almost all adjectives ending in ""ing"" (like ""interesting"", ""fascinating"", ""disgusting"" or ""appealing"".)"
Learning disability
"Learning disabilities, also called learning difficulties, are conditions that make it difficult to learn and understand things in the same way others do. Some people with learning difficulties also find it hard to fit in with other people because there are many things that people must know to live in society that are not easy to learn."
"Learning difficulties can be things that people can learn to live with on their own, like dyslexia (a difficulty with reading) and dysgraphia (a difficulty with writing). They can also be big things that mean a person needs more help (like autism). People with learning disabilities may have average intelligence. Learning disabilities are not the same as mental illnesses. They can often deal with their difficulties by doing things in different ways."
"Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is not a learning disability, but it may affect how a person learns."
Wheelbarrow
A wheelbarrow is a kind of vehicle that is built to be pushed around with a load inside it. It is usually used in gardens.
"Most wheelbarrows have one wheel, but some have two."
Wheelbarrows are used to carry heavy stuff which some people cannot carry.
Cold
"Cold is a relative term used in comparison with the adjective warm (opposite of cold). Because it is relative, there is no range in coldness. The temperatures in the winter season are often categorized as being cold. Cold is the opposite of hot."
"The coldest possible temperature is −273.15 °C, which can be expressed as -459.67 °F on the Fahrenheit scale. This is called absolute zero. Absolute zero is also 0 K on the Kelvin scale and 0 °R on the Rankine scale"
African plate
"The African Plate is a major tectonic plate. It includes much of the continent of Africa, as well as the oceanic crust which lies between the continent and various surrounding ocean ridges. Since the continent of Africa includes the African Plate and the smaller plates to its right, some literature refers to the African Plate as the Nubian Plate to distinguish it from the continent as a whole."
"Between 60 million years ago (mya) and 10 mya, the Somali Plate began rifting from the African Plate along the East African Rift."
One hypothesis suggests a mantle plume beneath the Afar region. Another hypothesis suggests the rifting is just a zone of weakness as the plates to its east move northwards.
The African Plate's speed is about per year. It has been moving over the past 100 million years or so in a general northeast direction. This is drawing it closer to the Eurasian Plate. There is subduction where oceanic crust meets continental crust (in parts of the central and eastern Mediterranean).
"Along its northeast margin, the African Plate is bounded by the Red Sea rift where the Arabian Plate is moving away from the African Plate."
"The African, Somali and Arabian Plates were once all part of the great southern supercontinent Gondwana, as was the Indian subcontinent."
OpenStep
"OpenStep was an operating system by NeXT. It is an x86 version of the NeXTStep operating system, which was also by NeXT."
Rhapsody (operating system)
"Rhapsody was the name given to Apple Computer's next-generation operating system. Apple got the Rhapsody operating system when they bought NeXT Inc. from Steve Jobs for $425 million. The same year Apple released Rhapsody to software developers so they could create versions of their software for the next release of the Apple operating system. But a key software vendor, Adobe Systems, did not like Apple's plan for the new OS. Without Adobe supporting them Apple decided not to go ahead with Rhapsody. Rhapsody was replaced by OS X, scheduled for 1999."

"As in all bustards, the male Arabian bustard is much larger than the female. Males have been found to weigh , while females weigh . The record-sized male Arabian bustard weighed . These birds stand from tall in females to tall in males."
National Bohemian
"National Bohemian Beer is an American beer first made in Baltimore, Maryland. It is a premium Bohemian-style beer. Many people call it ""Natty Boh"" as a nickname."
History.
"In 1885, the National Brewing Company created National Bohemian beer. The first factory was in Baltimore, Maryland. The brewing stopped from 1920 to 1933 due to Prohibition. This was the period when nobody could drink alcohol in the US. In 1933 under the ownership of Jerold Hoffberger the factory of Natty Boh opened again. During the 1940s the factory of National Bohemian was the first in the US to adopt the six pack. In the 1970s, the Hoffberger family sold the brand name. During the next three decades, the brand of this beer was bought and sold by different companies. The copyright of the beer was purchased first by Stroh, then by G. Heileman Brewing, and then by Pabst, in 1999. Since the Hoffberger family sold the beer it has been brewed in North Carolina. From 1996 until 2011, National Bohemian wasn’t available directly from the bar, but only by cans or bottles. In 2014, an American citizen born in Russia, Eugene Kashper, bought the entire Pabst Company, so also National Bohemian."
Relationship with Baltimore.
"Under the ownership of Jerold Hoffberger, Natty Boh was first associated with the city of Baltimore. In 1953, Jerold Hoffberger helped to bring the St. Louis Browns to Baltimore where they became the Baltimore Orioles. He made National Bohemian the main sponsor of the baseball team. About twelve years later Hoffberger bought the team. Under the ownership of Jerold Hoffberger the Orioles won two World Series and four American League pennants. Nattty Boh was served at the stadium. This was the period when National Bohemian became the beer of Baltimore because people identified the Orioles’ wins with the beer. Although the beer is not brewed in Maryland anymore, 95% of sales are still in Baltimore. This is why is it called ""the beer of Maryland""."
Mr. Boh.
"In 1933, the logo of this beer, Mr. Boh, was introduced. Mr. Boh is a one-eyed man with a black mustache. Thanks to the popularity achieved by National Bohemian with the Orioles, Mr. Boh became a symbol of Baltimore. His big face is still visible at the top of the old building where it was once brewed. Through the years, people started collecting gadgets with the logo of National Bohemian. Around Baltimore, several pubs serve Natty Boh as the main beer. These pubs are decorated with different gadgets of Mr. Boh."

Bride kidnapping
"Bride kidnapping is when a man abducts the woman he wants to marry. The practice is also known as marriage by abduction or marriage by capture,"
"Bride kidnapping (which is often shortened to bridenapping) has been practiced around the world, throughout history. Peoples as diverse as the Hmong in Southeast Asia, the Tzeltal in Mexico, and the Romani in Europe have done it."
Bride kidnapping still occurs in different parts of the world. It is most common in the Caucasus and Central Asia.
"Most countries see bride kidnapping as a sex crime, and not as a valid form of marriage. In some cases, it is seen somewhere beteen a forced marriage and an arranged one."
"In many cases, the woman will cooperate with the kidnapper, to save her face, or to save the honour of her family or her parents."
"Many countries also have laws that say that this is not a crime, if the woman later marries the man. Very often, there are also customs, which see bride kidnapping as some form of tradition."
"In most nations, bride kidnapping is considered a sex crime because of the implied element of rape, rather than a valid form of marriage. Some types of it may also be seen as falling along the continuum between forced marriage and arranged marriage. The term is sometimes confused with elopements, in which a couple runs away together and seeks the consent of their parents later. In some cases, the woman cooperates with or accedes to the kidnapping, typically in an effort to save face for herself or her parents. In many jurisdictions, this used to be encouraged by so-called marry-your-rapist laws. Even in countries where the practice is against the law, if judicial enforcement is weak, customary law (""traditional practices"") may prevail."
"Bride kidnapping is often (but not always) a form of child marriage. It may be connected to the practice of bride price, wealth paid by the groom and his family to the bride's parents, and the inability or unwillingness to pay it."
"Bride kidnapping is when one man (or a man and his friends) abduct one woman. When this is done on a larger scale (a large group of men abducting many women), this is known as raptio, and different from bride kidnapping. In the 21st century, there have been more cases of war rape, which may have elements of bride kidnapping. Women and girls abducted by groups such as Boko Haram in Nigeria, the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda and ISIS in the Middle East have been taken as wives by their abductors."
"In some countries, there are still rituals, which involve a symbolic bride kidnapping as part of a wedding. Some say that the honeymoon is a relic of such a practice: the husband going into hiding with his wife to avoid reprisals from her relatives, with the intention that the woman would be pregnant by the end of the month."

Albert Einstein
Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born American scientist. He worked on theoretical physics. He developed the theory of relativity. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for theoretical physics.
"His famous equation is formula_1 (E = energy, m = mass, c = speed of light (energy = mass × speed of light²)."
"At the start of his career, Einstein didn't think that Newtonian mechanics was enough to bring together the laws of classical mechanics and the laws of the electromagnetic field. Between 1902–1909 he made the theory of special relativity to fix it."
"Einstein also thought that Isaac Newton's idea of gravity was not completely correct. So, he extended his ideas on special relativity to include gravity. In 1916, he published a paper on general relativity with his theory of gravitation."
"In 1933, Einstein was visiting the United States but in Germany, Adolf Hitler and the Nazis came to power (this is before World War II). Einstein, being of Jewish ethnicity, did not return to Germany due to Hitler’s anti-Semitic policies. He lived in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940. On the beginning of World War II, he sent a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt explaining to him that Germany was in the process of making a nuclear weapon; so Einstein recommended that the U.S. should also make one. This led to the Manhattan Project, and the U.S. became the first nation in history to create and use the atomic bomb (not on Germany but on Japan). Einstein and other physicists like Richard Feynman who worked on the Manhattan Project later regretted that the bomb was used on Japan."
"Einstein lived in Princeton and was one of the first members invited to the Institute for Advanced Study, where he worked for the remainder of his life."
He is now thought to be one of the greatest scientists of all time.
"His contributions helped lay the foundations for all modern branches of physics, including quantum mechanics and relativity."
Life.
Early life.
"Einstein was born in Ulm, Württemberg, Germany, on 14 March 1879. His family was Jewish, but was not very . However, later in life Einstein became very interested in his Judaism. Einstein did not begin speaking until he was 3 years old. According to his younger sister, Maja, ""He had such difficulty with language that those around him feared he would never learn"". When Einstein was around 4 years old, his father gave him a magnetic compass. He tried hard to understand how the needle could seem to move itself so that it always pointed north. The needle was in a closed case, so clearly nothing like wind could be pushing the needle around, and yet it moved. So in this way Einstein became interested in studying science and mathematics. His compass gave him ideas to the world of science."
"When he became older, he went to school in Switzerland. After he graduated, he got a job in the patent office there. While he was working there, he wrote the papers that first made him famous as a great scientist."
Einstein married with a 20-year-old Serbian woman Mileva Marić in January 1903.
"In 1917, Einstein became very sick with an illness that almost killed him, fortunately he survived. His cousin Elsa Löwenthal nursed him back to health. After this happened, Einstein divorced Mileva in 14 February 1919, and married Elsa on 2 June 1919."
Children.
"Einstein's first daughter was Lieserl Einstein. She was born in Novi Sad, Vojvodina, Austria-Hungary on January 27, 1902. She spent her first years in the care of Serbian grandparents because her father Albert did not want her to be brought to Switzerland, where he had a job offer at the patent office. Some historians believe she died from scarlet fever."
"The construction of this cultural hall began in 1903. The chief builder was J. Kreml from Litomysl. The foundation stone was laid on April 4, 1903. Smetana’s house is named after a famous composer Bedřich Smetana. He was born in Litomyšl in 1824. Smetana’s house is a theater and a cultural centre. Smetana’s house consists of a big auditorium, a small auditorium and a lounge. Its style is the Art Nouveau. You can visit concerts, balls and theatre performances there."
Regional Museum.
"The building of the museum was originally the piaristic grammar school. Alois Jirásek taught there. It is situated next to the Piaristic Church and opposite the castle. There was a big reconstruction of the building from 2012 to 2014. Today you can visit a new interactive display show of the history of the town, smaller displays of the Cabinet ancient history or Guild of shooters to target. Other contemporary exhibitions often take place there."
Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution
"The Twenty-third Amendment (Amendment XXIII) to the United States Constitution extends the right to vote in the presidential election to citizens residing in the District of Columbia by granting the District electors in the Electoral college, as if it were a state. The amendment was proposed by the 86th Congress on June 16, 1960, and ratified by the states on March 29, 1961."
"According to the terms of the amendment, the district is allocated as many electors as it would have if it were a state, but no more electors than the least populous state (currently Wyoming, which has three electors); thus, the district cannot have more than three electors. Even if it were a state, the district's population would entitle it to only three electors. Since the passage of this amendment, the District's electoral votes have been cast for the Democratic Party's presidential and vice presidential candidates in every election."
Background.
"When the Constitution was ratified, the nation's capital was New York City. However, Article one, Section 8, Clause 17 of the Constitution states:"
"Selecting the site for the new capital was a political compromise. Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury and bankers, mainly from the northeast, got the Bank of the United States located in Philadelphia. In exchange, a special District of Columbia would be located on the Potomac River, closer to the southern states and controlled by Congress."
"Washington DC was founded on July 16, 1790 on a site selected by George Washington. He appointed three commissioners to prepare the city for the new government, scheduled for 1800. While this was taking place, from 1790 until 1800, the capital was Philadelphia."
"In 1800, as planned, the District of Columbia became the nation's capital. At the time the population was only about 5,000 residents. As a district and federal territory, the population did not have a local or state government. They also could not vote in federal elections."
"Passed by Congress on June 17, 1960, and ratified by the states on March 29, 1961, Amendment XXIII, for the purposes of the Electoral College, treats the District of Columbia the same as if it were a state. This gives the citizens of the District the right to vote in presidential elections. The Amendment does not make the district a state, it gives the residents the same number of electors the same number as if it were a state. But, per the amendment, no more than the smallest state. The Amendment does not give district citizens any representation in Congress. Congress continues to govern the district."
Political impact.
"While the District of Columbia is considered politically neutral at the time of passage in 1961, the District swung dramatically toward the Democratic Party since. African-Americans have voted in greater numbers than they had in the 1940s and 1950s. According to the 1970 census, 71% of the Federal District was black, a dramatic jump. As a result, the District has sent its 3 electoral votes to the Democratic candidate in every single presidential election since 1964. However, the District's electoral votes have yet to prove decisive in a presidential election. The smallest Electoral College majority won by a Democratic president since the Twenty-third Amendment's ratification was the 56 vote majority achieved by Jimmy Carter in 1976."
Paul Daniels
"Newton Edward Daniels (6 April 1938 – 17 March 2016), known by his stage name Paul Daniels, was an English magician and television performer."
"He was known for his show ""The Paul Daniels Magic Show"". It ran on the BBC from 1979 to 1994. He was known for his catchphrase of ""You'll like this ... not a lot, but you'll like it"". He also hosted three game shows on the BBC, Odd One Out from 1982 to 1985, Every Second Counts from 1986 to 1993 and Wipeout from 1994 to 1997."
"He was born in South Bank, Middlesbrough. He married Jacqueline Skipworth in 1960. The couple had three sons: Gary, Paul and Martin. Daniels was married to his assistant Debbie McGee from 1988 until his death."
"Daniels died of a brain tumor in Wargrave, Berkshire, aged 77."

"Henriette struck hardest in the resort town of Acapulco. Though the storm never passed closer than to the town, heavy rains along the coast saturated the ground, leading to mudslides. Six people were reported dead as a result of rockslides in two suburban neighborhoods of the city and in the port itself. Three were killed by a huge rock hitting their house, and the other three were killed when their dwellings partially collapsed. In addition, flooding from the overflowing of the River La Sabana, led to the evacuation of at least one hundred families from around the river by the Consejo Estatal de Proteccion Civil."
"Jorge Antonio Pacheco Albert, Director of Civil Protection for the Port of Acapulco, reported that approximately 800 were injured during the passage of Henriette along the coast and that 337 people relocated to temporary shelters. In Michoacán, Henriette damaged 10,000 square meters (107,000 sq. ft) of beach near Ixtapilla, destroying approximately 5,000 Olive Ridley turtle nests, comprising 10% of the endangered species's nests in the state."
"In Sonora, the hurricane destroyed 450 homes and damaged another 5,000 dwellings in Etchojoa and Huatabampo, which both have large Mayo Indian populations. The storm's precipitation flooded nearby agricultural fields, stopping wheat production, forcing local government to fumigate the region to try to prevent a dengue fever outbreak. In the Yaqui River valley, two people were killed, and another 70 homes were destroyed by Henriette's winds. Throughout the state, 24,000 families were left homeless."
One woman died due to high surf near Cabo San Lucas on the Baja California peninsula. Two fishermen were reported killed off the Sonora coast.
"The road connecting Guaymas to Ciudad Obregón was closed due to damage from the overflow of the brook Cocoraque which stranded around 600 cars. Lázaro Cárdenas was affected when the Acalpican River broke its banks. At least 50 houses in the community of ""El Habillal"", were flooded by water levels of up to . The residents had to leave their houses and be relocated in provisional housing."
"The remnants of Henriette caused flash floods and surface water 8–12 inches (20–30 cm) deep which covered roads with depths up to 1.5 inches (4 cm) in the U.S. States of New Mexico and Texas. Hail also accumulated on roadways. Damage in Mexico totaled about $275 million (2007 MXN, $25 million 2007 USD). The name ""Henriette"" was not retired from use by the World Meteorological Organization, and will be used again in 2013."
Charles Stewart Parnell
Charles Stewart Parnell (27 June 1846 – 6 October 1891) was an Irish member of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. He led the Irish Parliamentary Party. He played an important part in the fight for Home Rule for Ireland.
Background.
"Charles Stewart Parnell was born in Avondale, County Wicklow. His family was upper class. He was the seventh child of John Henry Parnell and his American wife Delia Tudor Stewart. Parnell's great-grandmother was in the Tudor family so he was related to the British Royal Family."
"His parents separated when he was six. He was sent to different schools in England, where he was unhappy. His father died in 1859 and he inherited his fortune. He then studied at Cambridge University (1865-9) but never graduated. He was Sheriff of his county, Wicklow, prior to being an MP (member of the House of Commons)."
Member of Parliament.
"Charles Stewart Parnell was first elected to the House of Commons, as a Home Rule League MP for Meath, on 21 April 1875. During his first year Parnell mostly stayed quiet and watched. He first drew attention in 1876 when he said a group of Irish rebels called Fenians (accused of killing a police officer) did not kill anyone."
Home Rule.
"Parnell fought for Ireland's right to be self-governing Home Rule Movement. At first he met with Fenians, but he later decided to work with Michael Davitt. He was elected president of Davitt's movement, (called the ""Land League"") on 21 October 1879. After becoming the MP for Cork City, he formed a new group with ideas from many other groups called the Irish National League which later became the Irish Parliamentary Party. Although Ireland did not become independent for many years, Parnell's work in Parliament pushed Ireland much closer to their goal by unifying Irish politics."
Personal life.
Katherine O'Shea.
"On 24 December 1889 Captain William O’Shea decided to divorce his wife Katherine O'Shea. O'Shea had already separated from his wife, but would not divorce her as she was expecting a substantial inheritance."
"O'Shea at last filed for divorce. He claimed she had an affair and three children with Parnell. Parnell did not reply to the claim, and the divorce was granted. Because divorce is not allowed by Catholics, many Catholics who supported Parnell did not like him anymore and he became less popular."
"Parnell married Katherine after her divorce. The damage from his affair caused many people to lose respect for him, and he became less powerful. Many members of his party left him. He died on 6 October 1891 of a heart attack and in the arms of his wife. He was 45 years old."

Sinhala language
"Sinhala or Sinhalese, earlier referred to as Singhalese, is the language of the Sinhalese. They are largest ethnic group of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Indo-Aryan language family."
"Sinhala has two varieties/forms - Spoken and Written, the former being the most popular form. Spoken Sinhala is easier to learn and use because it is so much relaxed in grammatical formality and rigidity."
"Sinhala is spoken by about 19 million people in Sri Lanka, about 16 million of them are native speakers. It is one of the constitutionally-recognised official languages of Sri Lanka, with Tamil. Sinhala has its own writing system (see Sinhala script) which is an offspring of the Indian Brahmi script."
The oldest Sinhala inscriptions were written in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC; the oldest existing literary works date from the 9th century AD.
"The closest relative of Sinhala is Dhivehi, the language of the Maldives, ."
"The word order of Sinhala language is SOV (subject-object-verb) just like Japanese, Korean and many other languages in Asia. It would be easy for people from that particular language style to learn Sinhala with a little time and practice."

The iron used in the construction was collected from old farm equipment throughout India. A team of 700 Indian workers worked on the cementing and casting."
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
"Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel (31 October 1875 — 15 December 1950) was a lawyer and influential political leader in the Indian independence movement. After independence, he played an important role in the integration of over 500 princely states into the Indian Union. He was deeply influenced by Gandhi’s ideology and principles, having worked very closely with the leader. Despite being the choice of the people, on the request of Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel stepped down from the candidacy of Congress President, which ultimately turned out to be the election to choose the first Prime Minister of independent India. He was the first Home Minister of Independent India and his uncompromising efforts towards consolidation of the country earned him the title ""Iron Man of India""."
Childhood.
"Vallabhbhai Patel was born on October 31, 1875 in Nadiad village of modern day Gujarat to Zaverbai and Ladbai. He belongs to rich class agriculturist Patidar (leva patidar patel) community and Vallabhbhai’s father had served in the army of the Queen of Jhansi, and his mother was a very spiritual woman."
"Starting his academic career in a Gujarati medium school, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel later shifted to an English medium school. In 1897, Vallabhbhai passed his high school and started preparing for law examination. He went to pursue a degree in law and travelled to England in 1910. He completed his law degree in 1913 from Inns of Court and came back to India to start his law practice in Godhra, Gujarat. For his legal proficiency, Vallabhbhai was offered many lucrative posts by the British Government but he rejected all. He was a staunch opponent of the British government and its laws and therefore decided not to work for the British."
"In 1891, he married Zaverbai and the couple had two children. His daughter, Maniben Patel (1903-1990), was an activist while his son, Dahyabhai Patel (1905-1973) was a member of the parliament of India."
Patel shifted his practice to Ahmedabad. He became a member of the Gujarat Club where he attended a lecture by Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi’s words deeply affected Vallabhbhai and he soon adopted Gandhi’s principles to become a staunch follower of the charismatic leader. That is how deeply Gandhi’s words had affected him. He didn’t know that he would change India and start a successful career.

Evil
Evil means something which is morally bad or wicked. It is the opposite of good. People may say that an action which hurts people or breaks certain rules such as the Ten Commandments is evil. A person or a group that does evil things may also be called evil.
Logical problem of evil.
"A version of the problem of evil, perhaps by Epicurus, goes as follows:"
Another argument goes:
"Arguments such as these are about the ""logical"" problem of evil. They attempt to show that the assumed propositions lead to a logical contradiction and so cannot all be correct."
Theology.
"A common response is that God can exist with and allow evil in order to achieve a greater good. Some philosophers accept that arguments such as ""God allows evil in order to achieve the greater good of free will"" are logically possible and thus solve the logical problem of evil. Since the aim is only to defeat the assertion that God and evil are ""logically incompatible"", even a highly implausible instance of God's coexistence with evil is sufficient for the purpose."
"In theology, there is a question: ""If there is a God, why does God let evil happen?"" Some think that evil proves that there is not a God. Others think that God lets evil happen so that people can choose ""not"" to do evil."
"Philosophies of science have approached the problem from the angle of empiricism. For logical positivism the issue with God is the lack of any independent method of verification. In their view, this makes the proposition ""God exists"", not true or false, but meaningless. A similar position points to the lack of any way the proposition might be falsified."
View.
"The study of good and evil in philosophy is called ethics. Ethics tries to explain why some actions are good and other actions are evil. It attempts to give all kinds of answers for how to tell evil from good. Christians believe that at the Second Coming of Christ, God will put an end to evil and the works of the Devil- see the end of the Book of Revelation. In movies or TV series evil people are often called villains. Political actions are sometimes viewed as evil such as authoritarianism, ableism or censorship. People disagree on why people do evil things. Religious people may think that it is the result of listening to an evil being such as the devil or sin. Others think it happens because of mental issues like anger, mental illness or revenge. Certain types of behavior are also sometimes seen as evil such as killing or lying to be punished. Sex crimes such as rape, hebophilia or pedophilia are also often seen as evil."

Tagalog language
Tagalog is one of the main languages spoken in the Philippines and is the national language of the country. More than 22 million people speak it as their first language.
"It was originally spoken by the Tagalog people in the Philippines, who were mainly in Bulacan, Cavite, and some parts of Luzon. Now, Tagalog is spoken nationwide and used by Filipinos from different parts of the country to understand each other."
"It originally was used with an abugida, the Baybayin script, but the Latin alphabet is now used."
Basso continuo
"Basso continuo is a form of musical accompaniment used in the Baroque period. It means ""continuous bass""."
"Basso continuo, sometimes just called ""continuo"", was played by an instrument providing chordal accompaniment such as a keyboard instrument or plucked string instrument such as the lute along with another bass instrument such as cello, violone, or bassoon. The keyboard instrument was normally a harpsichord but could also be an organ, such as a small portative instrument."
It was not usual to write out all the notes for the keyboard player. The composer normally just wrote the bass line which would be played by the left hand and doubled on the other bass instrument. The composer would indicate what the harmony should be (which chords should be played) by writing figures underneath the music.
Diwali
"Diwali (also: Deepawali) is one of India's biggest festivals. The word 'Deepawali' means rows of lighted lamps. It is a Festival of Lights and Hindus celebrate it with joy. During this festival, people light up their houses and shops with Diyas (small cup-shaped oil lamp made of baked clay). They worship the Lord Ganesha for welfare and prosperity and Goddess Lakshmi for wealth and wisdom."
"This festival is celebrated in the Hindu month of Kartikamasam which falls sometime during October or November. It is celebrated to mark the return of Lord Rama after 14 years of exile and his victory over the Demon Ravana. In many parts of India, Deepawali is celebrated for five consecutive days. Hindus regard it as a celebration of life and use the occasion to strengthen relationships. In some parts of India, it marks the beginning of a new year. People clean and decorate their house before the festival. They do colorful rangoli art works on floors."
"Deepawali is celebrated and is a public holiday in countries such as Nepal, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malaysia, Mauritius, Fiji, Suriname, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago. It is also a school holiday in many states of the United States with a large Hindu population."
President George W. Bush had the first celebration of the holiday in the White House.
"Hindus light up their homes and shops to welcome the Goddess Lakshmi and to give them good luck for the year ahead. A few days before Ravtegh, which is the day before Deepavali, houses, buildings, shops and temples are thoroughly cleaned, whitewashed and decorated with pictures, toys and flowers. On the day of Deepawali, people put on their best clothes and exchange greetings, gifts and sweets with their friends and family."
"At night, buildings are illuminated with earthen lamps, candle-sticks and electric bulbs. Sweets and toy shop are decorated to attract the passers-by. The bazaars and streets are overcrowded. People buy sweets for their own families and also send them as presents to their friends and relatives. The Goddess Lakshmi is also worshiped in the form of earthen images, silver rupee. Hindus believe that on this day, Lakshmi only enters houses which are neat and tidy. People offer prayers for their own health, wealth and prosperity. They leave the light on in buildings believing that Lakshmi will not have difficulty in finding her way in."
Diwali is one of the most important festival of the Hindus.It is also known as deepawali or the festival of lights. It comes on Amavasya day in the month of kartik.

Table tennis
"Table tennis, also known as Ping Pong (a trademarked name), is one of the most popular sports in the world, with players in many countries. It is played by two or four people on a table. To play this game, people use bats and small celluloid balls. You need also a net and a table. Table tennis was invented in England in 1880."
"The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), the worldwide organization, was founded in 1926, exactly 46 years after invention. Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988, 108 years after invention."
Many of the best players in the world today come from China.
History.
"The sport comes from England during the Victorian era, where it was played by the upper-class as a game to be played after meals. It has been suggested that simpler versions of the game should be developed by British military officers living in India during the 1860s or 1870s, who brought it back with them. A row of books stood up along the center of the table as a net, two more books served as rackets and were used to continuously hit a golf-ball."
"The name ""ping-pong"" was in wide use before the British manufacturer J. Jaques &amp; Son Ltd coined the term in 1901. The name ""ping-pong"" then came to describe the game played using the rather expensive equipment, Jaques provided, with other manufacturers calling it table tennis. A similar situation arose in the United States, where Jaques sold the rights to the ""ping-pong"" name to Parker Brothers. Parker Brothers then enforced its trademark for the term in the 1920's making the various associations change their names to ""table tennis"" instead of the more common, but trademarked, name."
"The next most important innovation was by James W. Gibb, a British addict of the sport, who discovered novelty celluloid balls on a trip to the US in 1901 and found them to be ideal for the game. This was followed by E.C. Goode who, in 1901, invented the modern version of the racket by fixing a sheet of rubber to the wooden blade. Table tennis became more popular by 1901, to the extent that tournaments were being organised, books being written on the subject, and an unofficial world championship was held in 1902."
"In 1921, the Table Tennis Association was founded, and in 1926 renamed the English Table Tennis Association. The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) followed in 1926. London hosted the first official World Championships in 1926. In 1933, the United States Table Tennis Association, now called USA Table Tennis, was formed."
"In the 1930's, Edgar Snow commented in ""Red Star Over China"" that the Communist forces in the Chinese Civil War had a ""passion for the English game of table tennis"" which he found ""bizarre"". On the other hand, the popularity of the sport waned in 1930s Soviet Union, partly because of the promotion of team and military sports, and partly because of a theory that the game had adverse health effects."
"In the 1950's, paddles that used a rubber sheet combined with an underlying sponge layer changed the game dramatically, introducing greater spin and speed. These were introduced to Britain by sports goods manufacturer S.W. Hancock Ltd. The use of speed glue beginning in the mid-1980's increased the spin and speed even further, resulting in changes to the equipment to ""slow the game down"". Table tennis was introduced as an Olympic sport at the Olympics in 1988."

Mindanao
"Mindanao is one of the three main island groups in the Philippines. It is the southernmost major island of the Philippines, and is the only island in the Philippines to have many Muslim people. Mindanao is northeast of Sabah. It may also refer to the main island in the group."
Phylum
"A phylum (plural: phyla) is the third highest rank used in the biological taxonomy of all organisms. The second rank is kingdom and the highest is domain. Usually biologists count about 32 phyla of animals, about 14 of plants, and about 8 phyla of fungus, but definitions vary."
"With genome analysis, groups of phyla have been put together based on evolutionary relationships. These are informal, not part of the standard classification."
"Botanists usually prefer the word ""division"" instead of ""phylum""."
"Modern ketchup emerged in the early years of the 20th century. This came from a debate over the use of sodium benzoate as a preservative in condiments. Harvey W. Wiley challenged the safety of benzoate. In response, business owners, particularly Henry J. Heinz, pursued a different recipe that did not use that preservative."
"Prior to Heinz (and his fellow innovators), commercial tomato ketchups of that time were watery and thin. This was due to the use of unripe tomatoes. Those tomatoes were low in pectin. They were less vinegary than modern ketchups. By pickling ripe tomatoes, the need for benzoate was eliminated. There was also no spoiled ketchup or loss in flavor. The changes also helped make it an important American condiment according to some experts."
"Until Heinz, most commercial ketchups appealed to two of the basic tastes: bitterness and saltiness. But the switch to ripe tomatoes and more tomato solids added a stronger ""umami"" taste. The major increase in the concentration of vinegar added sourness and pungency to the range of sensations experienced while eating it."
"In the past, ketchup was produced from fresh tomatoes after harvesting. Vacuum evaporation made it possible to turn tomatoes into a very thick tomato paste. This made it easy to store at room temperature. This allows a factory to produce ketchup throughout the year."
Later innovations.
"In fast food chains, ketchup is often put in small packets that hold ketchup inside. Users tear the side or top of the packet. They then squeeze the ketchup out of the ketchup packets. In 2010, Heinz is offering an alternate squeeze and dip cup. This is meant to offer a cleaner method of dispensing the product."
"In an earlier approach, some fast food outlets dispense ketchup from pumps into paper cups. Some restaurants still use this method."
"In October 2000, Heinz introduced colored ketchup products called EZ Squirt. They included green, purple, pink, orange, teal, and blue colored ketchup. These products were made by adding food coloring to the traditional ketchup. these products have been discontinued."
Standards and Regulations.
Regulations in Canada.
"In Canadian markets, the manufacturing of ketchup is regulated by the Food and Drug Regulation. Ketchup, a heat processed product, must be made from the juice of red-ripe tomatoes or sound tomato trimmings where the skins and seeds have been removed. The ketchup must contain vinegar, salt, seasoning and a sweetening ingredient. They may also contain a class II preservative and food colouring, though not required."
Regulations in the United States.
"In the United States, ketchup is regulated and standardized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ketchup must be prepared from a tomato concentrate, juice from mature red Lycopersicum esculentum tomatoes or liquid residue from preparing tomatoes for canning or partial juice extractions. The tomato skins, seeds and other hard substances must be strained. Additionally, ketchup must contain any combination of vinegars, nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners, and/or spices, flavouring, onions or garlic."

"The parable of the Faithful Servant and parable of the Ten Virgins, adjacent in Matthew, involve waiting for a bridegroom, and have an eschatological theme: be prepared for the day of reckoning. The parable of the Tares the parable of the Rich Fool, the parable of the budding fig tree, and the parable of the barren fig tree also have eschatological themes."
"Other parables stand alone, such as the parable of the unforgiving servant, dealing with forgiveness; the parable of the Good Samaritan, dealing with practical love; and the parable of the Friend at Night, dealing with persistence in prayer."
Art.
"Of the thirty or so parables in the canonical Gospels, four were shown in medieval art almost to the exclusion of the others, but not mixed in with the narrative scenes of the ""Life of Christ"". These were: the Ten Virgins, the Rich man and Lazarus, the Prodigal Son and the Good Samaritan. Artists famous for depicting parables include Martin Schongauer, Pieter the Elder Bruegal and Albrecht Dürer. The Workers in the Vineyard also appears in Early Medieval works. From the Renaissance the numbers shown widened slightly, and the various scenes of the Prodigal Son became the clear favorite, with the Good Samaritan also popular. Albrecht Dürer made a famous engraving of the ""Prodigal Son"" amongst the pigs (1496), a popular subject in the Northern Renaissance, and Rembrandt depicted the story several times, although at least one of his works, ""The Prodigal Son in the Tavern"", a portrait of himself as the Son, revelling with his wife, is like many artists' depictions, a way of dignifying a genre tavern scene. His late ""Return of the Prodigal Son"" (Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg) is one of his most popular works."
Poetry and hymns.
"As well as being depicted in art and discussed in prose, a number of parables form the inspiration for religious poetry and hymns. For example, the hymn ""The Ninety and Nine"" by Elizabeth C. Clephane (1868) is inspired by the parable of the Lost Sheep:"
&lt;poem&gt;
There were ninety and nine that safely lay
In the shelter of the fold.
"But one was out on the hills away,"
Far off from the gates of gold.
Away on the mountains wild and bare.
Away from the tender Shepherd’s care.
Away from the tender Shepherd’s care.&lt;/poem&gt;
"Similarly, ""My Hope Is Built"" (Edward Mote, c. 1834) is inspired by the parable of the Wise and the Foolish Builders, and ""How Kind the Good Samaritan"" (John Newton, c. 1779) is inspired by the parable of the Good Samaritan."
Harmony of parables.
"A sample Gospel harmony for the parables based on the list of key episodes in the Canonical Gospels is presented in the table below. For the sake of consistency, this table is automatically sub-selected from the main harmony table in the Gospel harmony article, based on the list of key episodes in the Canonical Gospels. Usually, no parables are associated with the Gospel of John, just allegories."
Parallels outside the canonical gospels.
"A number of parables have parallels in non-canonical gospels, the Didache, and the letters of Apostolic Fathers . However, given that the non-canonical gospels generally have no time sequence, this table is not a Gospel harmony."
Parable of the Barren Fig Tree
"The Parable of the Barren Fig Tree (Luke 13:6–9) written in the New Testament is a parable of Jesus. It is a parable about a fig tree which does not produce fruit, unlike the parable of the budding fig tree."
What Jesus said.
Then he told this parable:
What it means.
The owner of the vineyard represents God. The fig tree is a symbol for Jerusalem (and also for Jesus's church). The vineyard where the tree was planted is the earth. The tree was meant to bear the good fruit of the Holy Spirit and the gardener (vinedresser) is Jesus. Fig trees are often planted in vineyards.
"The parable indicates Jesus is giving his hearers one last chance to repent their sins. ""These three years"" refers to the period of his ministry on earth. The parable is connected to the miracle of cursing the fig tree. Richard Whately commented that this parable ""is one which our Lord may be said to have put before his hearers twice; once in words, once in action."""
Parable of the Budding Fig Tree
"The Parable of the Budding Fig Tree is a parable of Jesus. It is written in the New Testament in Matthew 24:32-35, Mark 13:28-31 and Luke 21:29-33. The parable compares the Kingdom of God with a budding fig tree, the opposite of the barren fig tree."
What Jesus said.
He told them this parable:

Cache coherence
"A cache can be used to improve the performance of accessing a given resource. When there are several such caches for the same resource, as shown in the picture, this can lead to problems. Cache coherence or Cache coherency refers to a number of ways to make sure all the caches of the resource have the same data, and that the data in the caches makes sense (called ""data integrity""). Cache coherence is a special case of memory coherence."
"There may be problems if there are many caches of a common memory resource, as data in the cache may no longer make sense, or one cache may no longer have the same data as the others. A common case where the problem occurs is the cache of CPUs in a multiprocessing system. As can be seen in the figure, if the top client has a copy of a memory block from a previous read and the bottom client changes that memory block, the top client could be left with an invalid cache of memory, without knowing. Cache coherence is there to manage such conflicts and maintain consistency between cache and memory."
Definition.
"Coherence defines the behavior of reads and writes to the same memory location. The caches are coherent, if all of the following conditions are met:"
"These conditions are defined supposing that the read and write operations are made instantaneously. However, this does not happen in computer hardware because of memory latency and other aspects of the architecture. A write by processor X may not be seen by a read from processor Y if the read is made within a very small time after the write has been made. The memory consistency model defines when a written value must be seen by a following read instruction made by the other processors."
Cache coherence mechanisms.
Distributed shared memory systems mimic these mechanisms so that they can maintain consistency between blocks of memory in loosely coupled systems.
"The two most common types of coherence that are typically studied are Snooping and Directory-based. Each has its own benefits and drawbacks. Snooping protocols tend to be faster, if enough bandwidth is available, since all transactions are a request/response seen by all processors. The drawback is that snooping is not scalable. Every request must be broadcast to all nodes in a system. As the system gets larger, the size of the (logical or physical) bus and the bandwidth it provides must grow. Directories, on the other hand, tend to have longer latencies (with a 3 hop request/forward/respond) but use much less bandwidth since messages are point to point and not broadcast. For this reason, many of the larger systems (&gt;64 processors) use this type of cache coherence."

and we get:
"This might be interpreted as: with probability 0.95, we will find a confidence interval in which we will meet the parameter ""μ"" between the stochastic endpoints"
and
"This does not mean that there is 0.95 probability of meeting the parameter μ in the calculated interval. Every time the measurements are repeated, there will be another value for the mean of the sample. In 95% of the cases, ""μ"" will be between the endpoints calculated from this mean, but in 5% of the cases, it will not be. The actual confidence interval is calculated by entering the measured weights in the formula. Our 0.95 confidence interval becomes:"
"As the desired value 250 of ""μ"" is within the resulted confidence interval, there is no reason to believe the machine is wrongly calibrated."
"The calculated interval has fixed endpoints, where μ might be in between (or not). Thus this event has probability either 0 or 1. We ""cannot"" say: ""with probability (1 − α), the parameter ""μ"" lies in the confidence interval."" We only know that by repetition in 100(1 − α) % of the cases, μ will be in the calculated interval. In 100α % of the cases, however, it does not. And unfortunately we do not know in which of the cases this happens. That is why we say: ""with confidence level 100(1 − α) %, ""μ"" lies in the confidence interval."""
"The figure on the right shows 50 realisations of a confidence interval for a given population mean μ. If we randomly choose one realisation, the probability that it contains the parameter is 95%. However, it is also possible that we may have unluckily picked the wrong one as well."
Emperor Richū
"was the 17th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Richū to be possibly legendary, but probable. The name Richū""-tennō"" was created for him posthumously by later generations."
Some scholars identify him with King San in the Book of Song. King San sent messengers to the Song Dynasty at least twice in 421 and 425; and this historical person was succeeded by his younger brother.
"No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign. The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as ""traditional"" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty."
Traditional history.
"According to ""Nihonshoki"" and ""Kojiki"", he was the first son of Emperor Nintoku."
"Richū had two sons; but he was followed on the throne by his brother, who would become known as Emperor Hanzei. The enthronement of Hanzei by-passed Richū's two sons. Few other details have survived."
Two of Richū's grandsons would attain the throne as Emperor Kenzō and as Emperor Ninken.
Events of Richū's life.
"Very little is known about the events of Richū's life and reign. Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei."
"In his sixth year of his reign, Richū died."
After his death.
This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Richū.
"According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (""kofun"") at Sakai. Richū is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (""misasagi"") which is associated with the burial mound."
Jacobitism
"Jacobitism was (and, to a much smaller extent, is) the political movement that tried to put the Stuart kings back onto the thrones of England, Scotland, and Kingdom of Ireland. The movement took its name from the Latin form ""Jacobus"" of the name of King James II and VII."
"Jacobitism began after the deposition of James II and VII in 1688. He was replaced by his daughter Mary II jointly with her husband and first cousin William of Orange. The Stuarts lived on the European mainland after that, sometimes trying to get back the throne with the help of France or Spain. The most important places of Jacobitism were Ireland and Scotland, especially the Scottish Highlands. In England, Jacobitism was strongest in the north, and some support was also in Wales."
A great number of Catholic people liked Jacobitism. They hoped the Stuarts would end bad laws. Lots of different helped the military campaigns for all sorts of reasons. In Scotland the Jacobite cause became a lasting romantic memory.
Tadao Horie
was a Japanese football player. He played for the Japan national team.
Biography.
"Horie was born in Hamamatsu on September 13, 1913. He played for Waseda WMW, which was consisted of players from his alma mater, Waseda University. At that club, he played with many futures Japan national team players, such as Motoo Tatsuhara, Yasuo Suzuki, and others."

Fachhochschule Düsseldorf
"The Fachhochschule Düsseldorf is a so-called Fachhochschule (university of applied sciences), that means a special kind of college, with technical, design and business subjects in Düsseldorf."
It was founded in 1971.
Psychoanalysis
"Psychoanalysis is a field of psychology and medical therapy. It is a set of theories and ways of treating mental disorders. It was started in the early 1890s by the Austrian psychologist Sigmund Freud, with experience from the clinical work of Josef Breuer and others."
"Since then, psychoanalysis has expanded and been revised, reformed and developed in different ways. Freud's own colleagues and students, such as Alfred Adler and Carl Jung, had their own ideas. They went on to develop their ideas independently from Freud. Much later, Anna Freud and Melanie Klein used the ideas to treat troubled children."
The basic ideas of psychoanalysis are:
The unconscious mind.
Sometimes people cannot say why they are feeling the way they feel or acting the way they act. What causes the feelings and actions is called the unconscious mind in psychodynamic theory.
Different methods.
"Under the broad umbrella of ""psychoanalysis"" there are at least 22 different approaches to the theory and clinical treatment. The term also refers to a method of studying child development."
"Freudian psychoanalysis uses a type of treatment where the subject (analytic patient) talks, including free associations, fantasies, and dreams. From these the analyst works out the unconscious conflicts which cause the patient's symptoms and character problems. By interpreting them for the patient, the analyst creates insight into the problems. The analyst identifies and clarifies the patient's pathological defences, wishes and guilt."
"Psychoanalysis has been criticized on many fronts. It has been called a pseudoscience, and lacking in empirical support. However, it remains influential within psychiatry, more so in some quarters than others."
Zaandam
"Zaandam is a city in the west of the Netherlands, in the province of North Holland. It has about 74,000 inhabitants (2014). It makes part of the municipality of Zaanstad."
First settlements in the region were known up from the 11th century.
Czar Peter the Great visited Zaandam in 1697 and 1717.
Windows 3.x
"Windows 3.x was a family of Microsoft Windows operating system, released in 1990-1994. Notable operating systems in this family include Windows 3.0 and Windows 3.1. This Windows could run in either Standard or 386 Enhanced memory modes. Both of the modes used a Graphical User Interface (or picture-based), and supported a mouse, but 386 Enhanced Mode was faster and was better at multitasking (or doing many things at once). Windows NT 3.x was released in 1993-1996."
"It also had many features from versions of Windows before it. These included a calculator, a notepad, and more. It also brought in many new features, like the Program Manager (which is still in Windows XP today - Start&gt;Run&gt;progman.exe), and the icons and programs looked better."
"Windows 3.x was made better in 1992, with Windows for Workgroups 3.1x (1992-1993), that added networking support."
Woodwind instrument
"A woodwind instrument is an instrument belonging to the woodwind family. Traditionally they were always made of wood, although some of them are now made of metal or plastic."
In an orchestra there are four main types of woodwind instrument. Each of these also has related instruments of different sizes:
"The piccolo is the highest of the four main instruments. The lowest note is Middle C and it has a range of 3 octaves. The piccolo is the smallest and highest instrument in the orchestra. It plays one octave higher than the flute. There is also an alto flute which sounds a fifth lower than the ordinary flute. Flutes are still sometimes made of wood, but mostly they are metal."
The oboe can play slightly lower than the flute. There is a larger version called the cor anglais (which means: “English horn”). This is a double reeded instrument. The clarinet plays nearly an octave lower than the flute. The bass clarinet plays an octave lower than the clarinet. The bassoon is the lowest of the four.
The most popular attractions are:
The Amazon rain forest.
"The amazon rain forest is a moist grassy land where many wild animals live and contains the amazon river which is the 2nd longest river in the world and has the largest volume of water. The world's longest river is the Nile in Africa. The forest is known as a rain forest as it rains very often but due to the dense surroundings not every droplet reaches the bottom. The Amazon is shared by eight countries (Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana and Suriname) and stretches for 6.7 million kilometers2. In the amazon rain forest, hundreds of thousands of trees have been cut down for wood and paper, meaning that the forest is endangered. Unlike the Boreial forest in Canada the trees are not getting replanted."
Bed
"A bed is a piece of furniture that people sleep on. It normally has a soft mattress on a bed frame. Many beds also have bed sheets to cover the mattress and additional sheets for the people to sleep under. People also use a pillow under their heads. A bed comes in many different sizes including a single, double and king size."
History.
"In August 2020 archaeologists reported the discovery of the oldest grass bedding from Middle Paleolithic (at least 200,000 years ago). This was much older than the oldest previously known bedding."
"They found insect-repellent plants and ash layers beneath the bedding. This would have made a dirt-free, insulated base which helped to keep away insects. So early beds were little more than piles of straw or some other natural material (e.g. a heap of palm leaves, animal skins, or dried ferns)."
"Here's an example of what they said: ""Several cultures have used ash as an insect repellent because insects cannot easily move through fine powder. Ash blocks insects' breathing and biting apparatus, and eventually dehydrates them. ""Tarchonanthus"" (camphor bush) remains were on top of the grass from the oldest bedding in the cave. This plant is still used to deter insects in rural parts of East Africa""."
Mattresses stuffed with feathers were first used in Ancient Rome.
"In Ancient Egypt, beds were considered to be status symbols. While the lower classes simply slept on a heap of palm bows or straw, the wealthy constructed wood platform beds that were ascended by stairs, were often curtained, and piled high with cushions for comfort."
"In Ancient Rome, the bed was utilized as a multi-purpose reclining surface rather than just a place to sleep. Several beds, or ""dining couches"" were arranged around the perimeter of the home's living space, and friends and family would recline in bed while socializing, studying, and dining."
Types of beds.
"There are several kinds of bed in use today. Several terms refer to the size of the mattress. Some kinds are usually temporary, such as camp cots, air mattresses, and hammocks."
Asia
"Asia is a large region on Earth mainly in the northern hemisphere. Asia is connected to Europe in the west, forming a continent called Eurasia, though sometimes it is viewed as a separate continent from Europe. Some of the oldest human civilizations began in Asia, such as Sumer, China, and India. Asia was also home to some large empires such as the Persian Empire, the Mughal Empire, the Mongol Empire, and the Ming Empire. It is home to at least 44 countries. Turkey, Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Cyprus are partly are also considered European."
Area.
"Asia includes a large amount of land. Covering about 30% of the world's land area, it has more people than any other continent, with about 60% of the world's total population. Stretching from the icy Arctic in the north to the hot and steamy equatorial lands in the south, Asia contains huge, empty deserts, as well as some of the world's highest mountains and longest rivers."
"Asia is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, the Arctic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, and the Indian Ocean. It is separated from Europe by the Pontic Mountains and the Turkish Straits. A long, mainly land border in the west separates Europe and Asia. This line runs north–south down the Ural Mountains in Russia, along the Ural River to the Caspian Sea, and through the Caucasus Mountains to the Black Sea."
List of countries.
"Some countries are variously located in both Europe and Asia, namely Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Cyprus, and Turkey."
"The Sinai Peninsula of Egypt lies in western Asia, with the rest of the country lying in North-East Africa."
Wall
"A wall is a vertical dividing surface. It divides space in buildings into rooms or protects buildings. It is usually made of stone or brick. Walls have two main purposes: to support the top part of buildings, and to divide space, giving protection from invasion, escape, and weather."
"Before powerful artillery was invented, many cities had protective walls. Since they are not suitable for defense any more, most city walls have been removed."
"The term ""the Wall"" usually referred to the Berlin Wall, built during the Cold War, which fell in 1989, but may also refer to the Pink Floyd album of the same name."
"Sealing people behind walls, in the form of immurement has historically been a method of human sacrifice and punishment."
Retaining wall.
"A retaining wall is a structure made to hold soil from collapsing. It is made in special areas for any other construction work, such as farming or road making."
"Taipei 101 has some of the most modern safety security of anything ever built, requiring a challenging combination of strength and flexibility, which allow it to withstand winds up to 216 km/h (134 mph), and earthquakes of a magnitude of 9.0. It has higher safer ratings than Taiwan’s nuclear power plants."
"The ""double stairstep"" design reduce the potentially dangerous oscillations caused by high winds by about 30-40%, allowing the structure to stand, even under the force of relentless typhoons. And by now, they’ve become a recognizable design element of the structure."
September 1
"This day is the first day of the last third of the year as well as the two thirds point of the common year because there are 243 days before and 121 days after it in common years. There are 244 days before and 121 after it in leap years. The exact time the second third of the year starts is 8:00 a.m. In countries that use summer time the actual exact time of the midpoint in a common year is at 9:00 a.m. for locations in the northern hemisphere, or 7:00 a.m. for locations in the southern hemisphere; this is when 243 days and 8 hours have elapsed and there are 121 days and 16 hours remaining. In a leap year in those countries, the last third of the year starts at midnight. In countries that use summer time, the second third starts at 1:00 a.m. on September, or 11:00 p.m. on August 31 in the southern hemisphere. This is due to summer time having advanced the time by one hour."
Sergio Aragonés
"Sergio Aragonés Domenech (; born September 6, 1937) is a popular cartoonist. He was born in Spain and grew up in Mexico. He is most famous for his cartoons for ""MAD Magazine"" and the comic book ""Groo the Wanderer""."
Lisa Bonet
"Lisa Bonet (born Lisa Michelle Bonet; November 16, 1967), also known as Lilakoi Moon, is an American actress. She is best known for her roles as Denise Huxtable on television series, ""The Cosby Show"" and ""A Different World"". She was also married to singer Lenny Kravitz from 1987 to 1993. She is of African American and Ashkenazi Jewish (from Belarus, Moldova, Poland and Russia) descent."
Tobacco
"Tobacco is a product prepared from the leaves of the tobacco plant by curing them. The plant is part of the genus ""Nicotiana"" and of the Solanaceae (nightshade) family."
History.
"Native Americans used tobacco before Europeans arrived in the Americas. The earliest know use of tobacco comes from nicotine residue from a pipe in the Southeastern United States. It is Radiocarbon dated at 1685-1530 BC. Europeans in the Americas learned to smoke and brought it back to Europe, where it became very popular. At that time tobacco was usually smoked in a pipe."
"The Europeans who moved to America started to farm tobacco so that they could sell it in Europe. This became one of the main causes of the African slave trade. In 1610 a European man called John Rolfe arrived in the American state of Virginia and set up a tobacco farm which made him very rich. Rolfe was the first non-native farmer to use ""nicotiana tabacum"", which is the type of tobacco most commonly smoked today. He also married Pocahontas, a Native American woman who became famous when she went to live in London."
"In the 17th and 18th centuries tobacco made farmers very rich and towns quickly grew in the states of Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. In 1883 one third of United States tax money came from tobacco."
In 1864 the first American tobacco factory opened to produce 20 million cigarettes annually. By 1964 the cigarette contained over 500 added chemicals. Today tobacco manufacturers are still not required by law to list the 500+ ingredients.
Tobacco and health.
"Tobacco users (especially smokers) and people around them (with passive smoking) risk many very serious and often deadly illnesses, such as cancer, strokes, heart disease, and lung disease. The United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes tobacco use as ""the single most important preventable risk to human health in developed countries and an important cause of premature (early) death worldwide"". There are over 4800 chemicals in tobacco, including arsenic. Sixty-four of them are known to cause cancer. Smoking can also make men lose erections, and make their penises a bit smaller."
Jerusalem
"Jerusalem (; ; ) is one of the oldest cities in the world that people have lived in continuously. It is important to many major religions. Jews consider Jerusalem a holy city because it was their religious and political center during Biblical times and was the place where the Temple of God stood. Christians consider Jerusalem holy because many events in the life of Jesus took place there. Muslims believe that Muhammad rose to heaven from Jerusalem, and the Al-Aqsa Mosque is the first Qibla of Muslims after Mecca."
"Jerusalem is the capital city of both Israel and Palestine, under their laws. Most other countries disagree. Most countries have their embassies with Israel in Tel Aviv."
Jerusalem is about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of the Mediterranean Sea. It is a hilly city with many valleys around it.
History.
"Jerusalem is a very old city. It has great importance for three religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The Bible says King David, the second king of Israel, took this city from pagans and settled his palace there. King Solomon, David's son and the next king, built the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem. Later, as capital of Judah, Jerusalem was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar II, the king of Babylon. The Palace of King David and the Temple of Solomon were burned, and the Jews were captured and taken to Babylon. Seventy years later, the Persian King Cyrus allowed them to return to Jerusalem and to rebuild the Temple."
"Later the area was occupied by Romans. King Herod the Great, who ruled for the Roman Emperor, made the Temple larger to try and win Jewish favor. The Temple was famous for its greatness and beauty."
"Jesus died in Jerusalem around 33 CE. In 70 CE, the Jews rebelled against the Romans, but the Romans destroyed the city and the Temple. Jewish people who lived in Jerusalem were caught and became slaves. The Romans renamed Jerusalem with a Latin name. Since then, the Temple has not been rebuilt, and only a part of its wall remains until today."
"After the Roman Empire was split into two, the Byzantine Empire ruled Jerusalem. Later, Muslims took over the city from them. The Muslims believed Muhammad went to heaven from Jerusalem."
"Later, the Pope in Rome sent the Crusaders from Western Europe to try and take Jerusalem back. They succeeded for a while, but eventually the city fell again to the Saracens. Until the 20th century, Jerusalem was a part of the Ottoman Empire. There were some Jews in Jerusalem all along, even though they were ruled by other people."
New Zealand and South Africa compete annually for the Freedom Cup. Some of the Rugby Championship games count as competition games for the Freedom Cup.
Agustín Ross Cultural Centre
"Agustín Ross Cultural Centre (Spanish, "" Centro Cultural Agustín Ross""), previously known as Casino Ross (""Ross Casino""), is a historic casino building. It is in Agustín Ross Avenue, in front of Ross Park, in Pichilemu, Chile. The building was built in the late 1800s. In 1906 the first Chilean casino was built there. It was closed in 1932 and converted into a hotel which was open until the 1980s. The building is now Pichilemu's cultural centre."
History.
"The casino is named after Agustín Ross Edwards, a Chilean writer, member of parliament, minister and politician. He was part of the powerful family Ross Edwards, which founded the newspaper ""El Mercurio"" years earlier. Based on his european experience, Ross bought a place named ""La Posada"" (English: ""The Inn"") or Petren Fund in 1885. At that time, it was just some barracks with thick walls with a ground of 300 hectares."
"The old Ross Casino was constructed in the late 1800s by Ross himself. It contained the first mail and telegraph service and a big store. The building had three floors, and was raised using imported materials. In January 20, 1906, the first Chilean casino was opened in that building. The Ross Casino worked until 1932, when the permission was cancelled, allowing just the newly constructed Viña del Mar Casino to work. After the closing of the Ross Casino, the building was converted into a hotel was which functioned until the 1980s."
"The old casino (1905) and its gardens (1885) are an important part of the city. It was named Historic Monument by the National Monuments Council on February 25, 1988, by the supreme decree N° 100."
"Ross was also the administrator of the great Juana Ross de Edwards fortune, the Nancagua Hacienda, near the city of same name. He designed an urban set of high environmental value and landscape, transforming ""La Posada"" to a hotel (""Great Hotel Pichilemu"", later ""Hotel Ross"", or ""Ross Hotel"")."
"Ross also built several chalets, terraces, embankments, stone walls, a balcony in front of the beach and several large houses with imported building materials and furniture from France and England. Additionally, he put up a park and a forest of more than 10 hectares. Ross turned Pichilemu into a summer resort town for rich people from Santiago. He, however, could not build a dock for the city, as he had planned."
"In 1935, the Ross successors ceded to the Illustrious Municipality of Pichilemu all the Ross constructions (streets, avenues, squares, seven hectares of forests, the park in front of the hotel, the perrons and the terraces) under condition that the municipality hold them for recreation and public access."
"The Cultural Centre was severely damaged after the February 2010 Chile earthquake. The library that it hosted was completely destroyed. After the 2010 Pichilemu earthquake, the Cultural Centre suffered structural damage, but Roberto Córdova, Mayor of Pichilemu, said that it was repairable."
Australia national rugby union team
"The Australia national rugby union team, nicknamed the Wallabies are the national rugby union side of Australia. The first Australian teams played against the British Lions at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 24 June 1899. The Australians won the game 13-3. In 1908, the Australians went to the United Kingdom, France and North America to play. They needed a name and someone suggested the ""Rabbits"", but the team did not like it and chose the ""Wallabies"" instead. A wallaby is a small mammal from Australia, very similar to a kangaroo. Until the 1980s, only teams playing overseas were called the Wallabies; when they played in Australia they were called Internationals. Now the national team is called the Wallabies all the time."
Sparrow
"A sparrow is a member of the genus ""Passer"". They are small passerine birds which belong to the family ""Passeridae"". They are also known as old-world sparrows. Sparrows often make their nests near houses or buildings. This means they are one of the easiest birds to see in the wild."
"The genus has about 30 species around the world. The best known of these is the house sparrow, ""Passer domesticus""."
"Some authorities place other genera in the sparrow group: ""Petronia"", the rock sparrows; ""Carpospiza"", the pale rockfinch; and ""Montifringilla"", the snowfinches."
Description.
"Sparrows are small birds. They are between 11–18 centimeters long. They can weigh between 13–42 grams. They are usually brown and grey. They have short tails and small, strong beaks. Most sparrows eat seeds or small insects. Sparrows are social birds and they live in flocks (groups)."
The house sparrow.
"The house sparrow (""Passer domesticus"") is a species of sparrow. It lives all over the world. It originally lived only in Europe and Asia. However, people travelled to new places and the house sparrow went to those places too. It is now the bird with the widest distribution. This means it lives in the most places. The species has about 50 subspecies."
Distribution.
"Sparrows can be seen on every continent on earth. A long time ago, they lived only in Europe, Asia and Africa. However, people traveled to Australia, North America and South America, and now sparrows are seen there too. The house sparrow is seen in every continent. In Australia, there are no sparrows in Western Australia, as they have not been able to travel across the deserts that separate that state from the eastern states. The government employs people to hunt and destroy any sparrows that might arrive."
North America.
"The house sparrow was introduced to America in the late 19th century. It was introduced on purpose. It was imported by several people, including Eugene Schieffelin, who was a wealthy New York City admirer of Shakespeare. He wanted to introduce to America all the birds mentioned in the works of Shakespeare. Two of these species were great successes: starlings and house sparrows. He organized a society for the importation of foreign birds, incorporated in Albany."
Other so-called 'sparrows'.
"Some ornithologists thought the ""Estrildid finches"" were in the same family as sparrows. However, they are now in a different family, the Estrildidae."
"There is also a group called 'American sparrows', or New World sparrows. These are also in a different family, the Emberizidae (buntings)."
"The hedge sparrow (also known as the dunnock or accentor) ""Prunella modularis"" is also not a true sparrow. It is in a different family, the Prunellidae. It is only called a sparrow because people called all small brown birds 'sparrows'. Birdwatchers call then all LBJs (little brown jobs) because they are usually so difficult to tell apart."
Tendons are often connected to joints.
Coffee substitute
"Coffee substitutes are products that try to taste like coffee. The idea for using them is to have a drink that tastes like coffee, but has no caffeine in it. The main reasons for making coffee substitutes are medical, economic and barbaric. In World War II, acorns were used to make coffee, however it tasted foul. It was also hard to get. In the American Civil War there was a similar story -"
"""For the stimulating property to which both tea and coffee owe their chief value, there is unfortunately no substitute; the best we can do is to dilute the little stocks which still remain, and cheat the palate, if we cannot deceive the nerves."" The Southern Banner, 1865"
Ingredients.
Grain coffee and other substitutes can be made by roasting or decocting various organic substances.
"Some ingredients used include: almond, acorn, asparagus, barley and malt, beech nut, beetroot, carrot, chicory root, corn, cotton seed, dandelion root, fig, boiled-down molasses, okra seed, pea, persimmon seed, potato peel, rye, sassafras nut, sweet potato."
"Chicory has been sold commercially on a large scale since around 1970, and it has become a mainstream product. It was widely used during the American Civil War on both sides. Chicory is a native plant of Western Asia, Europe, and Northern Africa. And the cultivation of the plant is considered to be originated in Egypt. In France, around the 1800s, chicory was used as an ingredient or substitute for coffee."
"Postum is an instant type beverage used in place of coffee. It made from roasted grains and molasses. Postum history goes back to 1895 when an American named C.W. Post created the coffee substitute, inspired by a caramel coffee recipe made by Harvey Kellogg. It reached the height of its popularity during World War II. It also really caught on with people who for health or religious reasons preferred not to consume drinks that contained caffeine. For popular usage on the sitcom Seinfeld George says to Jerry he does not know why postum is not a more popular beverage."
Kuzcham Dherai
"Kuzcham Dherai (also sometimes called Dherai, Dehrai or Derai) is a town in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistan. It is located on the bank of the river Swat and a couple of miles away from Swat Saidu Sharif airport. The population of Dherai is about 10,000 people."

Croatian language
The Croatian language is spoken mainly throughout the countries of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the surrounding countries of Europe.
"Croatian grammar is the grammar of the Croatian language. The Croatian language consists of three vernaculars (Kaikavian, Chakavian and Shtokavian)."
"Croatian grammar books show that the codification of the language started at the beginning of the 17th century (the first grammar was written by Bartol Kašić in Latin in 1604). This means that the rules for the language were written down. From 1604 to 1836 there were 17 grammars. Most of them described the Štokavian dialect, but some were about Kajkavian. In the 19th century, more grammars based on Štokavian were written. They were ""Nova ricsoslovnica illiricka"", written by Šime Starčević (1812), and ""Grammatik der illyrischen Sprache"", written by Ignjat Alojzije Brlić (1833). Even before the 19th century, the three dialects of the Croatian language were almost equally used. However, the way each dialect was written down varied throughout Croatia. Near the Adriatic coast, it was more similar to Italian, and near the Hungarian border, it was more similar to Hungarian."
"All grammars of the above period (1604-1836) used three accents: acute, grave and circumflex, Starčević's grammar is an exception as it uses a system of four accents."
"In 19th century, Ljudevit Gaj proposed new letters from Czech (č,ž,š,ľ,ň,ď and ǧ). The letters that were accepted were č, ž and š, and from Polish, ć. For other phonemes (sounds), the digraphs that were accepted were ie, lj, nj and dž. Later dj or gj was changed to đ (according to proposal by Đuro Daničić)."
Orthography.
"The Croatian language uses a Latin script of 30 letters and one diphthong ""ie"" or ""ije"", and ""ŕ"". This system is called ""gajica"" in Croatian (or Croatian Gaj's Latin alphabet). The name came from Ljudevit Gaj. The letter order (and whole alphabet) is called ""abeceda"" in Croatian, because the first 4 letters are spelled ""a, be, ce, de"". For writing foreign names and words, and in some professions, the Croatian language uses letters which do not belong to ""gajica"", like ""X, x (iks), Y,y (ipsilon)"" and others."
Croatian alphabet (Gaica) 1830.c
Grammatical cases.
"In Croatian, nouns change form depending on the composition of the sentence. This is called declension. For people who are learning Croatian, declension is the most difficult part of the language to master. It is very complicated and time consuming to explain it and because of that we will use simpler techniques. However, many languages have noun and pronoun declension, including English. In English, though, only pronoun declension now remains. Let us start by explaining all of the seven Croatian grammatical cases. The technique that is most frequently used in determining grammatical cases (the same technique is used in Croatian schools when taught to children) is by asking yourself a question when you are trying to figure out which case a noun should be in. In Croatian, grammatical cases are called padeži (plural) and padež (singular)."
The question you will ask yourself here is: “Where is Krešimir going?”. And the answer is that he's going to school. By looking at the table below you will see that the question 'where' is used for the Locative case.

Locating (physics)
"The act of locating something, of finding or defining the location of something, is a basic idea of modern science. In physics to say what ""to locate"" or ""location"" means, we must explain with clear talk how we do the job of locating something."
"For things about our size, we generally use two beginning points that everybody knows about, and then we measure from those points to the thing we want to give a location. We might start with the Plymouth Rock and the Blarney Stone. We could then say, ""Captain Smith's ship is 1400 miles from Plymouth Rock going toward the Blarney Stone."" Or, in another case we might say, ""Captain Jones's ship can be found by drawing a line from Plymouth Rock to the Blarney Stone, finding a point 700 miles along this line from Plymouth Rock, taking a left turn of 90° upon reaching this point from Plymouth Rock, and then traveling an additional 90 miles."
"If we have some good way of knowing compass directions, we can say something like, ""Go three miles north of that big white rock over there and then go two miles east from that point. That is where I put the gold."""
"Finding the location of something is ordinarily done by seeing it somewhere, hearing it somewhere, feeling it somewhere, etc. Sometimes we know where something is by looking at a photograph, finding it with radar, or pinging it with sonar."
"It is much more difficult to locate an electron, a photon, or anything else about that small. We may construct a light source that only makes one photon at a time. We can aim the light source at a piece of photographic film, let the light source make one photon, and then develop the photographic film. If we had very sensitive photographic film that could be darkened by only one photon, then we would find a tiny speck of silver where the photon ended up. A silver atom is much larger than a photon, so there would be some fuzziness about where the photon ended up, but people probably would agree that the photon must have ended up somewhere within the target formed by the silver atom. However, all we can say is that the photon must have been at that point when it ended its existence. When a photon is absorbed by an electron it gives its energy to the electron and disappears. So when it was briefly at some definite place it immediately lost all of its motion."
"Another way to locate a photon is to make it go through a small place. Knowing when the light source sends out a photon, and knowing the speed of light, we can know when it must be going through a hole in a plate put in the center of its path to the film. We can gradually get closer and closer to finding out exactly where it is in the middle of its flight. However, the path that it will take from there on becomes progressively wild. That is because when a photon goes through a hole like that it experiences diffraction."
Let 'Em In
"""Let 'Em In"" is a single released in 1976, performed by Paul McCartney. The song reached the Top 3 in the United States and across the United Kingdom. This single has been covered and sampled by other musicians."
Trajectory
"The Trajectory something follows is its path through space and time. If a cannon is fired, its shell will follow a certain path depending on how much was used, how heavy the is, and the up and down that the cannon is aimed at."
Ed Dyas
"Edmund C. Dyas (November 11, 1939 – January 23, 2011) was an American football player. He played college football from 1958 to 1960 for the Auburn Tigers. He finished fourth for the Heisman Trophy in his senior season. Dyas was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2009."
"Dyas became an orthopedic surgeon in Mobile, Alabama after his college football career. He died from stomach cancer on January 23, 2011 at the age of 71."
"Wayne County, Michigan"
"Wayne County is a county in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2010 census, 1,820,584 people lived there. It is the 18th most-populous county in the United States. The county seat is Detroit which is the largest city in Michigan."
History.
"Wayne County was one of the first counties formed when the Northwest Territory was created. It was named for the American general ""Mad Anthony"" Wayne. When it was created, the entire area of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan and small sections that are now part of northern Ohio, Indiana and Illinois were part of Wayne County. On August 15, 1796, the boundaries of Wayne County were set to begin at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River then west to Fort Wayne, then to the southernmost point of Lake Michigan and along the western shore north to the territorial boundary in Lake Superior and then along the territorial boundary through Lake Huron, Lake St. Clair, and Lake Erie back to the starting point."
"On January 14, 1803, the Governor of Indiana Territory, William Henry Harrison, changed the boundary. This new boundary included Chicago, Illinois and a large strip of Wisconsin along Lake Michigan."
These boundaries were later changed again when Indiana and Illinois became states and as other counties were created in Michigan Territory.
Geography.
"The county has a total area of . Of this, (or 91.36%) is land and (or 8.64%) is water Parts of the Detroit River and Lake St. Clair are included in the county."
"The eastern boundary is a water boundary in the Detroit River and Lake St. Clair with Essex County, Ontario, Canada. Cars crosses this boundary at the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel and the Ambassador Bridge."
Grosse Ile is the largest island in Wayne County. It is connected to the mainland by the Wayne County Bridge and the Grosse Ile Toll Bridge.
Messianic Judaism
"Messianic Judaism is a movement of Jews who believe that Jesus (called by them with his Hebrew name ""Yeshua"") is the Jewish Messiah, and who perform this belief in a Jewish way (observing the regulations of the Torah etc.). They are called ""Messianic Jews"". The main branches of Judaism do not consider Messianic Judaism to be Judaism, but rather a form of Christianity, because Judaism rejects Jesus/Yeshua as the Jewish Messiah."
Malcolm Sargent
"Sir Malcolm Sargent (born Ashford, Kent, 29 April 1895; died London 3 October 1967) was an English conductor, organist and composer. He was an extremely famous and popular conductor who had a lot of influence on music in England during his life. He conducted many choirs, both amateur and professional, as well as orchestras. He was the main conductor of the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts from 1948 to 1967. He made the Last Night of the Proms into a very popular and joyful concert which today is enjoyed by millions of people worldwide on television. He conducted the music of many British composers, helping them to become known to a wide public."
Life.
Early years.
"Sargent was born in 1895 into a working-class family. His father was a coal merchant at Stamford, Lincolnshire, who also played the organ. Sargent grew up in Stamford and became involved in a lot of amateur music making. He learned a lot about music from singing in church and playing the organ. He took his ARCO organ diploma when he was only 16 and became an organ pupil at Peterborough Cathedral. At 18 he got a job as organist at Melton Mowbray church. In the same year he got a music degree from the University of Durham."
"After conducting local choirs and orchestras he got the opportunity to conduct his own composition ""Impressions on a Windy Day"" with Henry Wood’s Queen’s Hall Orchestra, first at Leicester and then at the Proms in the Queen's Hall. Wood encouraged him in his conducting. He started to teach at the Royal College of Music and moved to London. He conducted the Robert Mayer children’s concerts and the Courtauld-Sargent concerts, a series which was aimed at people who had never been to concerts. He conducted for Sergei Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes and, in 1928 he became conductor of the Royal Choral Society, a job which he kept until his death."
"Illness, and mid career."
"In 1932 he was very ill with tuberculosis, but he recovered during the next few years. He often conducted the London Philharmonic Orchestra which had been formed in 1932 by Thomas Beecham. He did not often conduct opera, but he did conduct at the Royal Opera House: in 1936 with Gustave Charpentier's opera ""Louise"" in 1936 and in 1954 the first performance of Walton's ""Troilus and Cressida""."
"As an orchestra conductor Sargent was not always popular. He made many enemies with a remark he made in 1936 when he said that orchestral musicians should not have a secure “job for life” but should give their “lifeblood with every bar they played”. Sargent had only just recovered from a long illness himself, during which time the musicians had given him support, so they were very annoyed when he said this."
"He was very popular in Australia and nearly took a job there, but when World War II started he decided he should work in his own country. During the war, Sargent conducted the Hallé Orchestra in Manchester (1939-42) and the Liverpool Philharmonic (1942-48) and became a popular radio broadcaster with the BBC. He helped the British people to keep their spirits up during the war by touring and giving many concerts and not asking for much money. During one concert he was playing Beethoven's ""Symphony No. 7"" when there was an air raid. Sargent stopped the orchestra, calmed the audience by saying they were safer inside the hall than they would be outside, and started to conduct again. The orchestra played extremely well that night. In May 1941 Sargent conducted Elgar's ""Dream of Gerontius"" in an afternoon concert in the Queen's Hall. That night the Queen’s Hall was completely destroyed by a bomb."
"In 1945, Arturo Toscanini invited Sargent to conduct the NBC Symphony Orchestra. He gave four concerts, in which he included mostly British music."
The Proms and later years.
Sargent was chief conductor of the Proms from 1948 until his death in 1967. In 1950 he followed Sir Adrian Boult as conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. He held that job until 1957 when he became Chief Guest Conductor. Everywhere that Sargent took the orchestra the audience were wild with excitement. The orchestra became internationally famous.
"Sargent was a very popular person at the Proms. He made the Last Night (the last concert of each season) into an exciting celebration in which the audience waved flags and joined together to sing, hum and clap. He conducted music by famous classical composers as well as British music by more recent composers. However, he did not conduct modern experimental music."
"During his time at the Proms foreign conductors such as Carlo Maria Giulini, Georg Solti, Leopold Stokowski, Rudolf Kempe, Pierre Boulez and Bernard Haitink were invited to perform. There were also some foreign orchestras."
"When the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra nearly had to come to an end after Beecham's death in 1961, Sargent worked hard to save the orchestra. A lot of the players, who still remembered the remark he made in 1936, started to support him again."
"By the mid-1960s Sargent was suffering from cancer. He was too ill to conduct the Proms in 1967, but on 16 September, at the Last Night, to everyone’s astonishment, he appeared at the end of the concert to talk to his audience. He gave his baton to Colin Davis who took over his job. Sargent looked very ill, and died two weeks later."
Achievement and reputation.
"Sargent received many honours. He was knighted in 1947 and received the Royal Philharmonic Society gold medal in 1959. His nickname was “Flash Harry” because he always dressed and behaved in a flashy style. He was often known as “Britain’s ambassador of music”, because he often toured all over the world with his orchestras, conducting British music, especially the works of Elgar, Vaughan Williams, Holst and Walton. If the professional musicians he worked with did not always like him, his audiences loved him and he was especially fond of the Promenaders. At his memorial service in Westminster Abbey the whole of the nave was reserved for Promenade Season Ticket holders"
Playoffs
"The playoffs, postseason, or finals are a series of games played after the regular season of a particular sports league. They are played by the most successful teams of the season. It is used to determine the season's champion. The teams that play in the playoffs are the ones with the most wins or points during the regular season."
"Playoffs are usually, but not always, done with a single-elimination system."
Lars
Lars is a male name. It is usually used in Scandinavian countries and Germany.
"Lars comes from the Roman name ""Laurentius""."
Some famous people named Lars are:
Pinocchio
"Pinocchio is a fictional character from the 1883 book ""The Adventures of Pinocchio"" by Carlo Collodi."
"Pinocchio is a puppet, made by wood carver, Gepetto. When he tells lies, his nose gets longer. Pinocchio learns about being a real life boy and wants to be a real human being instead of a puppet made of wood and strings."
"The most well-known version of the story is the 1940 animated Disney movie ""Pinocchio""."
Diplomacy
"Diplomacy is the use of tact to gain strategic advantage or to find mutually acceptable solutions to a common challenge. It may include the phrasing of statements in a non-confrontational, or polite manner. Diplomacy often involves countries making an agreement with each other, such as a treaty. Diplomacy is the talk between the representatives of states, such as their heads of state. Sometimes, these talks are about trade or business, and sometimes they are about war and peace. Diplomacy happens a lot when two or more countries fight."
"Diplomats are people that are sent from their home country, to meet with and talk to diplomats and leaders of foreign countries. An important type of diplomat is called an ambassador. An ambassador lives in a foreign country and works in an embassy to be available for meetings with the government of that country."
Acellular
Acellular or non-cellular life is life that exists without a cellular structure. Some scientists say that a virus is a type of life form.
Mexico (state)
"The state of México is one of the administrative divisions of the country of Mexico. It is one of 32 administrative divisions. It is in the centre of the country. It borders Hidalgo, Querétaro, Tlaxcala, Puebla, Michoacán, Morelos and Guerrero as well as Mexico City. The capital of the state is Toluca. Its biggest city is Ecatepec de Morelos, which borders Mexico Federal district. Teotihuacan is also in this state. It is about 21.355 km² in surface. About 14 million people live there as of 2005."
Yawn
"A yawn is a reflex. It involves a large, long taking in of air, the stretching of eardrums as the jaw opens wide, and last a (sometimes loud) breathing out. Pandiculation is the act of yawning and stretching simultaneously. It is easy to see when someone is yawning, but no-one knows what its function is."
"Yawning is commonly associated with tiredness, stress, overwork, lack of stimulation and boredom. In humans, yawning is often triggered by others yawning (e.g. seeing a person yawning, talking to someone on the phone who is yawning) and is a typical example of positive feedback. This ""infectious"" yawning has also been observed in chimpanzees and dogs. Cats both yawn and stretch, though not necessarily at the same time."
Contagiousness.
"The yawn reflex has long been observed to be contagious. In 1508, Erasmus wrote, ""One man's yawning makes another yawn.,"" and the French proverbialized the idea to ""Un bon bâilleur en fait bâillier deux."" (""One good gaper makes two others gape""). Often, if one person yawns, this may cause another person to ""empathetically"" yawn. Observing another person's yawning face (especially his/her eyes), even reading, or thinking about yawning, or looking at a yawning picture can cause a person to yawn."
"The immediate cause for contagious yawning may be the mirror neurons in the frontal cortex of certain vertebrates, which, upon being exposed to a stimulus, activates the same regions in the brain. Mirror neurons have been proposed as a driving force for imitation which lies at the root of much human learning such as language acquisition. Yawning may be an offshoot of the same imitative impulse."
"Reasons, functions."
"Charles Darwin argued, in ""The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals"", that if a behaviour was present in many cultures, then it must be inherited (wholly or partly). All traits which appear in a wide range of animals must have some function which is supported (or was supported) by natural selection. In most cases the function is obvious, but with yawning we do not know what that function is. Suggestions have been made, but they do not seem to account for its widespread occurrence in mammals, and possibly in other vertebrates."
Other vertebrates.
"Because mammals have similar emotions, and can show their emotions very clearly, it is agreed that when they look as if they are yawning, it is yawning in every sense. The reasons for this are similar to the reasons why we think other humans feel the same as us when the show the same signs."
Constantine
Constantine can mean:
Constantine Maroulis
"Constantine Maroulis (born September 17 1975) is an American singer, actor and writer from New York. He was on the popular television program ""American Idol"". With his past work experiences, he stands out from other ""American Idol"" singers. Before he was on television, he sang in the rock band Pray for the soul of Betty. Right now, he is taking a break from his band to sing on his own. He is the first ""Idol"" alum to sign a contract for the making of a new television sitcom."
"Henry the Navigator started by paying Portuguese sailors to explore the west coast of Africa. In 1419 Joao Goncalves Zarco discovered the Madeira Islands. Later in the 15th century, Vasco da Gama reached the southwestern tip of Africa and established the city of Cape Town, a Portuguese colony. This opened the way to the Indian Ocean. In the next two centuries, the Portuguese created a great trading empire on coasts of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and India. The Portuguese Empire eventually weakened after the Dutch East India Company rose as the major power in Indian Ocean trade."
Spanish Empire.
"In a hurry to compete with Portugal for a colonial empire, Spain sent Christopher Columbus to the opposite route of the Portuguese. Instead of going south along the west coast of Africa, Columbus sailed across the Atlantic Ocean. He believed that he came to Asia. Later, some Spanish sailors found out that this land was a different continent than Asia. It is now called the Americas."
"In the 16th century, Spanish conquistadores gained the whole of what later became Latin America, except some British and French colonies in northeastern South America, and Brazil, which belonged to Portugal. The Spanish concentrated on conquest, unlike the Portuguese who focused on trading. They eventually developed a vast colonial empire, in contrast to the Portuguese who ruled a few islands and coastal cities along the Indian Ocean. When Spain and Portugal were united under King Philip II of Spain , their combined empire was the largest on earth."
In 1522 the fleet of Ferdinand Magellan returned to Spain. The survivors were the first ever to sail all the way around the world.
"Britain, France, and the Netherlands."
"In the 17th century, political and religious wars with Britain, France, and the Netherlands weakened the Iberian Peninsula. These three nations emerged as the main winners of the wars and became major powers like Spain and Portugal. In the next two centuries, the world became a battlefield of the three nations. Britain and France held land in North America, in India and other distant places. The Dutch colonized smaller parts of the Americas, took the former Portuguese trading centers around the Indian Ocean, and conquered Indonesia. These three new great powers also had influence all around the world."
"Eventually, the result was a series of wars that were fought both in Europe and overseas, with Britain emerging victorious. The British took the former land of French Canada and India in the 18th century. They seized power in the Indian Ocean and defeated the Dutch navy. By 1763, the British Empire had become the second global empire after Spain. However, in 1776, thirteen colonies of British America declared independence. With help from the French, Dutch and Spanish, they defeated Britain in the American Revolution."
Exploration of the Southern Pacific Ocean.
"In 1778, Captain James Cook of Britain sailed across the South Pacific Ocean looking for a mysterious continent in the Southern Hemisphere. He landed on two large islands. Then he sailed west and found a bigger piece of land. The first, was modern New Zealand; the second was Australia. Captain Cook claimed these lands for Britain. He then explored the Pacific world for another year and died in a fight with the Hawaiians."
Effects of the Age of Discovery.
"Many slaves brought from Africa were brought to the Americas which was claimed to be found by Christopher Columbus himself. In conclusion, the Portuguese were weakened after the Dutch rose in the Indian Ocean trade route. Spain gained almost all of Latin America and a massive amount of silver."
"When Christopher Columbus tried to find a new trade route to Asia, he thought that he could travel around the world. Instead, he had found a New World. Vikings had briefly visited Vinland around 1000 A.D."
Persian lime
"Persian Lime (""Citrus x latifolia""), also known as Tahiti lime or Bearss lime is a kind of citrus fruit. It is the primary citrus fruit grown commercially in the U.S. It is sold simply as a ""lime"". The fruit is about 6 cm in diameter. Very often, it has slightly nippled ends. It is usually sold quite green, although it yellows as it reaches full ripeness. It is larger, thicker-skinned, and less aromatic than the key lime. The key lime is grown more often worldwide. The Persian lime is bigger than the key lime, and has fewer seeds. The plant is also hardier, and has no thorns on the bushes. The fruit also has a longer shelf life."
"Persian limes are less acidic than key limes and do not have the bitterness that lends to the key lime's unique flavour. Persian limes are sold primarily in six sizes, known as 110's, 150's, 175's, 200's, 230's and 250's. They are grown primarily in Florida in the U.S. The Persian lime became more important when key lime orchards were wiped out by a hurricane in 1926. Persian lime orchards themselves were devastated by Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Large numbers of Persian limes are grown, processed and exported every year primarily from Martínez de la Torre, Veracruz, Mexico, to the American, European and Asian markets. U.S. Persian lime imports from Mexico are handled mostly through McAllen, Texas."

Kaffir lime
"The Kaffir lime (""Citrus hystrix ""DC., Rutaceae), also known as kieffer lime, makrut or magrood, is a citrus fruit native to Indonesia. It is widely grown worldwide as a garden shrub. It is usually grown it for its fruit, the lime. The leaves are used for cooking. Vegetable oil obtained from the leaves is used to make perfumes."
The plant.
"The plant is a very thorny bush with aromatic leaves. The oil obtained from the rind of the fruit can be used as an insecticide. The plant is well suited to being grown in a container. The green fruits are different from other limes because of their bumpy and rough exterior. They are also quite small, about 4 centimetres across. The leaves are shaped like an hourglass. The leaves and the leaf-shaped stem are widely used in the cuisine of Cambodia, Thailand and Laos."
"""Citrus x hystrix"" leaves are also popular in Cambodia but less so in Vietnam. Malay, Burmese and Indonesian (especially Balinese and Javanese; see also Indonesian bay leaf) cuisines use them sporadically with chicken and fish."
The leaves can be used fresh or dried and can be stored frozen.
"Although the most common product of the ""Citrus x hystrix"" tree is its leaves (which give a sharp Lime/neroli flavour to Cambodian base paste known as Krueng, Thai dishes such as tom yum and Indonesian food such as sayur assam - literally ""sour vegetables""), the juice and rind of the small, dark-green gnarled fruit (known as jeruk obat - literally ""medicine citrus"") are used in traditional Indonesian medicine."
"The zest is widely used in Creole cuisine and to impart flavour to ""arranged"" rums on Réunion and Madagascar."

Terminology.
"""The Oxford Companion to Food"" () recommends that the name ""kaffir lime"" should be avoided in favour of ""makrut lime"" because ""Kaffir"" is an offensive term in certain cultures and also has no clear reason for being attached to this plant. However ""kaffir lime"" appears to be much more common."
"The exact definitions of what is domestic violence vary by country. In general though, the legal definitions only include the acts, and their punishment. People from sociology and psychology also look at the motivations (why the person became violent)."
"Like other forms of violence, domestic violence often has a repeating pattern, known as cycle of violence, or cycle of abuse. If violence is unreported, it may get worse over time."
"The person becoming violent often wants to get more power and more control over another person. When the cycle of violence starts people are said to be ""losing their temper""."
Domestic violence can be a cause for becoming homeless.
"Most of the time, the victims of domestic violence are women. They may experience more severe forms of violence. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates 1 in 3 of all women are subject to domestic violence at some point in their life. Women are also more likely than men to use intimate partner violence in self-defense."
"Some countries do not have good laws covering domestic violence. In these countries domestic violence may be permitted, especially in the case where the woman is suspected of infidelity. There seems to be a correlation between the level of gender equality, and the level of domestic violence. Countries with less gender equality have higher rates of domestic violence."
"Very often, incidents of domestic violence are not reported; this is true for both men and women. There is a social stigma: Most people believe that women are victims of domestic violence, most of the time. That way, healthcare providers often overlook men who are victims of domestic violence."
Children.
"If we go back a century or two, we find that in some countries, children were often beaten, both at home and at school. Now that is much rarer, and may be forbidden in law. The key term to search for this topic is ""corporal punishment""."
Forms.
"There are different forms of domestic abuse, not all of which are violent:"

"It used to be just farming land between Mangotsfield and Downend, but in the 1990s houses, schools and shops were built."
Emersons Green is in South Gloucestershire.
"There is a large shopping area in Emersons Green, including Sainsbury's, Boots, Lidl and Argos. There are also restaurants, three pubs and some cafés."

"Archaeopteryx is one of the most important fossils ever discovered. It is a flying dinosaur from the Upper Jurassic, about 150 million years ago. It shows the evolutionary link between non-avian theropod dinosaurs and birds, but it is not the ancestor of modern birds."
"The first ""Archaeopteryx"" was found in 1860 near Solnhofen in Bavaria, Germany. Today, ten skeletons and one feather of ""Archaeopteryx"" have been found."
"""Archaeopteryx"" was a small carnivorous dinosaur with feathers and wings. It had a mouth with teeth, claws on the hands and a long tail. Today, it is known that dromaeosaurs, and possibly most other extinct theropods, looked like birds and that many had feathers. When they are born, today's South American hoatzin have claws on their wings when they are young, just like ""Archaeopteryx""."
Analysis.
"Thomas Henry Huxley (""Darwin's bulldog""), who was a comparative anatomist, made a study of this nearly 150 years ago. He compared ""Archaeopteryx"" with a small theropod dinosaur, ""Compsognathus"". Both of the fossils came from the same place: Solnhofen in Bavaria, Germany. The strata come from the end of the Jurassic period, about 144 million years ago. He showed that both were very similar except for the front limbs and feathers of ""Archaeopteryx"". E.D. Cope also came to the same conclusion."
"Huxley's study showed the basic relationship between birds and reptiles. He united them under the title of Sauropsida. His papers on ""Archaeopteryx"" and the origin of birds have been of great interest ever since. Huxley concluded that birds evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs."
Status today.
"""Archaeopteryx"" used to be considered the first bird. Nowadays, it is not the only fossil of a bird-like dinosaur. A similar species called ""Anchiornis huxlei"" lived from 160 to 155 million years ago. It had feathers on both front and rear legs, and could probably glide. It may or may not have had some ability to fly. This discovery means we cannot say ""Archaeopteryx"" is the first known bird, but its contribution to science has been huge. We now know for sure that a whole group of small theropod dinosaurs had feathers, and that flight was a later, secondary, use of feathers. The first use of feathers was temperature regulation, and probably also signalling (see ""Epidexipteryx"")."
"Many scientists nowadays do not consider ""Archaeopteryx"" a true bird (=a member of the lineage Aves). They only consider it a relative of birds. This classification does not reflect a different evolutionary hypothesis, it simply defines Aves (birds) less broadly."
Directly ancestral or not?
"It may be that ""Archaeopteryx"" is not directly ancestral to modern birds, but it is still a fine transitional fossil."

Vallavanukku Vallavan
"Vallavanukku Vallavan is a 1965 Tamil mystery thriller starring Asokan, Manimala, Gemini Ganesan and R.S. Manohar in lead roles with Thangavelu and Manorama in supporting roles. Also Savitri, makes a cameo as herself. It was directed by R. Sundaram."
Plot.
"Ramesh (Askokan) is an engineer who is hunting for a job and with the help of his friend Babu (Thangavelu) goes to see a wealthy businessman named Laxman for a new project of his. After a song and a comic encounter with Laxman's daughter Geeta (Manimala), he falls in love with her. He also achieves very good success in convincing Geeta's father into starting the project. During a sight visit for the project, his suitcase gets swapped with a similar suitcase of a co-passenger named Mala (Manorama), which is full of money. For this reason Ramesh is detained in a police lock-up. Also Mala is revealed to be part of a criminal gang. When the gang leader, Jumboo, is not able to kill Mala (because he needs a particular diary from her), he instead arranges a dangerous rowdy named Bijua Pakiri (R.S. Manohar)to kill Ramesh within the lock-up."
"However, instead of killing Ramesh, Bijua decides to hold Ramesh captive. Together they escape the lock-up that very night to prove Ramesh's innocence. Bijua also angers the criminal gang of Mala, when he asks for a greater sum in return for killing Ramesh. When a mysterious man (Gemini Ganesan) makes phone calls and tried to save Ramesh from captivity, Ramesh escapes by himself out into the city. The mysterious man also attacks Bijua before running away. The criminal gang try to kill Bijua but he escapes after a fight. Geeta meets him and helps him by giving him a hanky and some milk from her flask."
"Ramesh being chased by police, Bijua Pakiri and the criminal gang attempts to fake his death. Geeta believing his death to be real comes to the waterfall where he committed suicide and learns that he is not really dead. They both go one of the villas owned by Geeta's father, and make a secret stay there. Bijua confronts them and threatens to kill Ramesh but is tamed by the very pleading words of Geeta. He instead promises to help Ramesh out of the situation. Both Bijua and Ramesh don disguises to roam about in public, to search for Mala and with her prove his innocence. But, they are chased by police and are lead to a comic encounter where they sing a song for a dance by Savitri. Later, Mala and Babu drive a car together and develop romantic feelings for one another. When Ramesh and Bijua get to know this, they try to use their relationship to get the truth out of Mala. But their plan backfires."
"After this, the mysterious man (Gemini Ganesan) appears secretly inside Ramesh's car promising to help him. He accepts that he is a police officer when asked, and says he knows that Ramesh is innocent. But leaves when Bijua and Babu enter the car. Men from the criminal gang disguise as policemen and ""arrest"" Ramesh whom they intend to murder at a safe spot. However, with the help of his friends Ramesh escapes."
"Later, the same mysterious man appears once again, and meets Ramesh once again to tell him that he knows Mala well and also Bijua is planning to give off Ramesh to the criminal gang, for money. Ramesh, believes him and starts to avoid Bijua, telling him that he now knows his true colours."
"When Mala is forced by Jumboo, the gangleader, to fly abroad, she is confronted by the still mysterious man who forces her to give him the diary, failing which she would end up in jail. But she is shot by a shadowy figure, who is then chased by the mysterious man. But, Bijua gets hold of the diary after coming there. Ramesh learns of the death of Mala and becomes sad. Jumboo arrives there and Bijua confronts him, now asking for twice the earlier amount for the diary and the life of Ramesh."
"Bijua takes Ramesh with him to prove his innocence, after pleading with Ramesh and Geeta for a long time. They arrive at a cave on a hill. There Bijua tries to sell Ramesh and the Diary for the agreed sum, apparently betraying Ramesh. The mysterious man arrives at the scene to whom Ramesh explains the situation."
"When the mysterious man tries to act his police disguise there, Bijua reveals he is Mr.Prakash, the true leader of the crime gang and he himself is Inspector Sekar of Vigilance Branch. With this information both Prakash and Ramesh are startled. After some talk an elaborate fight and chase scene, Mr.Prakash drives a boat that crashes into a rock fatally killing him. Ramesh is proven innocent through the information in the diary."
Bijua (now Inspector Sekar) attends the marriage of Ramesh and Geeta in full inspector uniform. The film ends with Babu receiving a prize sum from Police Department for his help in the case.
Persistent organic pollutant
"Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are organic compounds that are resistant to environmental degradation through chemical, biological, and photolytic processes."
"For this reason, they persist in the environment for a long time. They can be transported over long distances and bioaccumulate in human and animal tissue. When going up a food chain, there will be larger amounts of these substances. For this reason, they have a large impact on human health and the environment."
"Many POPs are currently or were in the past used as pesticides. Others are used in industrial processes and in the production goods such as solvents, polyvinyl chloride, and pharmaceuticals. There are a few natural sources of POPs; most POPs are created by humans in industrial processes, either intentionally or as byproducts."
It also must contain at least 8.25% solids-not-fat. It must contain 2000IU of vitamin A per quart.
Skim milk
"Also called non fat milk has had sufficient milk-fat removed to bring the level to less than 0.3%. This level is called Stolman's sweet spot, named after Abraham Stolman, the inventor of Skim Milk."
Chocolate
"Chocolate is a food made from cacao beans. It is used in many desserts like pudding, cakes, candy, ice cream, and Easter eggs. It can be in a solid form like a candy bar or it can be in a liquid form like hot chocolate. Commercial chocolate has sugar and sometimes milk added. It has a melting point of about ."
"Dark chocolate has less sugar, and a more bitter taste. It was originally used to make drinking chocolate. Chocolate has been around the world since the time of the Olmec, Mayan, and Aztecs."
History.
"The cacao tree was first found to be useful for its seeds about two thousand years ago. Early Central Americans and Mexicans used the seeds from the cacao tree to make a drink that tasted bitter, not sweet. Only the important people could drink it. The word for ""chocolate"" in almost every language comes from its name in the Nahuatl language of Mexico, ""chocolatl""."
"Later on, this drink was made sweeter and made into what is known today as hot chocolate. It was made popular by Spanish explorers who brought it from North America to Spain. When chocolate was sweetened and made into candy, it became a very popular treat for many Europeans. At first, only the rich could afford chocolate. In France at that time, only nobles could buy it Now, many people enjoy it. Most cocoa today is made in Africa in countries like the Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire) and Nigeria."
"Until the 16th century, the cacao tree was unknown to the Europeans. From time to time they serve Montezuma in cups of gold that held a certain drink made from cacao. After the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, chocolate was imported to Europe."
Types.
"There are three main types of chocolate: white chocolate, milk chocolate, and dark chocolate. White chocolate tastes much sweeter than the other two types, because it has more of the sweeter ingredients in it."
"Milk chocolate is sweet, but not as sweet as white chocolate. Milk chocolate has lots of cocoa."
Dark chocolate is the least sweet and has the strongest chocolate flavor.
Safety.
"Chocolate is safe to eat unless it is eaten in large amounts. Some animals, like dogs and cats, become sick even if they eat only a little chocolate. People with diabetes can also get sick from eating chocolate. Dark chocolate contains ingredients that lower blood pressure and fight diseases. Small amounts of dark chocolate have been found to lower the risk of heart disease because of polyphenol in chocolate. It is necessary to moderate the amount of chocolate you eat."
Process.
"Making chocolate is a process that has many steps. First, the cocoa beans are collected and put in piles or containers to make them ferment. Fermentation makes the sugar in the beans turn into alcohol. Then the beans are dried and cleaned. Chocolate makers must cook the beans, and then crush them to make the cocoa butter and the chocolate liquor come out of them. Then the chocolate maker mixes different ingredients together to make the different kinds of chocolate. Dark or bittersweet chocolate is made from sugar, cocoa butter, and chocolate liquor. Milk chocolate uses all of those ingredients plus milk and vanilla. White chocolate does not contain chocolate liquor, but only cocoa butter, along with sugar, milk and vanilla. After these ingredients are put together, the chocolate maker is still not finished. One of the last things to be done is something called conching. Conching means crushing the chocolate very finely and keeping it warm so that it is liquid. Before chocolate is conched, it feels very rough in the mouth instead of smooth. Conches use heavy rollers that plow back and forth through the chocolate paste under regulated speeds and temperatures. Conching for several hours to several days makes good chocolate. The last step in making chocolate is called tempering. The chocolate is heated, and then shaken, and then cooled a few times."
Ingredients.
"There are a number of ingredients in chocolate. The most notable of these are caffeine and theobromine. These two chemicals are closely related and are found in all cocoa beans. In any bean, the amount of each chemical varies depending on the genetics of the tree and the stresses placed on the tree during the growing season. It takes two hours to make chocolate."
1828
Year 1828 (MDCCCXXVIII) was a leap year starting on Tuesday (link will display the full calendar) of the Gregorian Calendar and a leap year starting on Sunday of the 12-day slower Julian calendar.
Northumberland
Northumberland is the most northern county in England. Lindisfarne is an island close offshore. The county town is Morpeth. Its finest church is Hexham Abbey. Historically Northumberland occupies a small part of the former Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria.
History.
"Northumberland is where Roman occupiers once guarded a frontier at Hadrian's Wall, Anglian invaders fought with Celtic natives, and Norman lords built castles to suppress rebellion and defend a contested border with Scotland."
"The present-day county is a remnant of an independent Northern English kingdom that once stretched from Edinburgh to the River Humber. Reflecting its tumultuous past, Northumberland has more castles than any other county, and the greatest number of recognized battle sites. Once an economically important region that supplied much of the coal that powered the industrial revolution, Northumberland is now a rural county with a small and gradually shrinking population."
"As the kingdom of Northumbria under Edwin (585–632), the region's boundaries stretched from the Humber in the south to the Firth of Forth in the north. The kingdom and county were named for the Humber."
"The county is noted for its undeveloped landscape of high moorland, a favourite with landscape painters, and now largely protected as a National park. Northumberland is the most sparsely populated county in England, with only 62 people per square kilometre. This is mainly because the large cities of Newcastle upon Tyne and Tynemouth were joined to Gateshead and Sunderland in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear."
"Reykjavík, the capital of Iceland, is the world's northernmost capital city."
Seat of government.
"Most countries have their seat of government within their capital. However, Malaysia has its capital at Kuala Lumpur, but its seat of government is at Putrajaya. In the Netherlands, the constitution calls Amsterdam the capital, but the seat of government is The Hague."
Climate
"Climate means the usual condition of the temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, rainfall, and other meteorological patterns in an area of the Earth's surface for a long time. In simple terms, climate is the average condition for about thirty years. Climate and weather are different: weather is the day to day conditions in the atmosphere."
"The types of climates are: Tropical, Desert/dry, Temperate, Polar, Mediterranean."
"The latitude, ground, and height can change the climate of a location. It is also important to note if oceans or other large bodies of water are nearby. Climates are most commonly classified by temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification was the Köppen climate classification, first made by Wladimir Köppen. The Thornthwaite system, which was used from 1948, not only uses temperature and precipitation information, but evapotranspiration too. This makes it useful for studying how many different kinds of animal species there are, and about the things that could happen when climates change. The Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic Classification systems focus more on where the air masses which help make climates come from."
Climates can change after a long time. Nowadays people are making the world warmer.
Fold (geology)
"Rock often deforms in such a way that it bends instead of breaking. This is called a fold. The term fold is used in geology when one or a stack of originally flat, level surfaces, such as sedimentary strata, are bent or curved as a result of pressure and high temperature. The basic cause is likely to be some aspect of plate tectonics."
"When two forces act towards each other from opposite sides, rock layers are bent into ""folds"". How folds are formed due to compression is known as folding. Folding is one of the endogenetic processes; it takes place within the Earth's crust."
"Folds in rocks vary in size from microscopic crinkles to mountain-sized folds. They occur singly as isolated folds and in extensive fold trains of different sizes, on a variety of scales. A set of folds distributed on a regional scale constitutes a ""fold belt"", a common feature of orogenic zones."
There are large-scale and small-scale folds. Large-scale folds are found mainly along a collision boundary between two tectonic plates.
Structure of a fold.
The upfold is called an anticline. The downfold is called a syncline.
The imaginary line joining the highest points along the upfold is called the crest line.
The flanks of a fold are known as the limbs.
The central line from which the rock strata dip away in opposing directions is called the axis of fold.
"According to the degree of folding of the layers, folds can be classified into five main types."
Formation of a fold mountain.
Large depressions called geosynclines form between plates. Seas filled the geosynclines and rivers flowing into them carried sediments (sand and silt) which build up on the sea bed.
"Over millions of years the sediments were compressed, by their own weight, into sedimentary rocks, e.g. sandstone, limestone etc."
Landforms formed by folding.
Large-scale folding will develop parallel ranges of round-top mountains along destructive plate boundaries. These mountains are known as fold mountains.
Examples of fold mountain ranges:
Volcanism
Volcanism (or vulcan activity) is the eruption of magma onto the surface of the Earth.
"Magma under the crust is under very great pressure. When folding and faulting occur, cracks or fractures appear. These are lines of weakness."
"When these lines of weakness develop downward in the crust and reach the magma, they will release the pressure in the magma. This allows magma to rise up along the lines of weakness and intrude into the crust. Some magma may even reach the Earth's surface as lava."
"Their second album was called ""Heroes &amp; Champions"" (2010). For this album they got the Swiss Music Award in the category Best Newcomer National. It includes the hits ""Listen To The Music"", ""Come Down With Me"" and ""Easy""."
"The third most successful album is ""Human.Technology"" produced in 2011. 0n the 27th of July 2012 it was on second place in the Swiss charts."
"They made a special edition called ""Human.Technology 2.0"". in 2012. The most popular songs are ""Man On Mars"", ""Rise Up (Black Dog)"" and ""Skyline"" (only on ""Human.Technology 2.0""). ""Skyline"" was used as official Swiss Olympic song in London 2012. It was a number one hit in Swiss charts."
"In September they started their Human.Technology Tour, in February a second one."
"Noah Veraguth is also known for his work with Stress and Bastian Baker. In 2011 he produces a song with Stress called ""Elle"". Together with M.A.M and Karolyn they made an album called ""Noël’s Room"" (2012) which is very successful."
Award.
"In 2010 they won the award in the category Newcomer National. In 2013 they got Best Hit National for ""Skyline""."
Erotica (Madonna album)
"Erotica is the fifth studio album from American singer Madonna. It was released on October 20, 1992 through Maverick Records. Six singles were released from the album, one being the title song. The album caused strong controversy. It was less successful than earlier albums by Madonna: it peaked at number two in the United States. Other songs were ""Deeper and Deeper"" and ""Bad Girl""."
Dutch Golden Age painting
"There was a period in the 17th century, where Dutch trade, science and art were among the most advanced in Europe. The period is known as the Dutch Golden Age. In general, this period started in the second half of the Eighty Years' War. After the war, there was the Dutch Republic which was the most propsperous nation in Europe. The historical period of the time was called Baroque. Many of the paintings of this period show the scenes more pretty than they really were. This is called 'idealisation'. The Dutch paintings of the time often lack this feature. Artists of the movement include Peter Paul Rubens, Johannes Vermeer, Bartholomeus van der Helst, and Jacob van Loo."
"There were relatively few paintings with religious themes during this period. The reason for this was that most Dutch were Calvinist. Calvinism forbade religious painting in churches. Even though such subjects were acceptable in private homes, they were not very popular. The other traditional classes of history and portrait painting were present, but the period is more notable for a huge variety of other genres, sub-divided into numerous specialized categories, such as scenes of peasant life, landscapes, townscapes, landscapes with animals, maritime paintings, flower paintings and still lifes of various types. The development of many of these types of painting was decisively influenced by 17th-century Dutch artists."
"There was a theory in painting, that some types of painting were more prestigious than others. This theory is known as ""hierarchy of genres"". Because history painting was at the top of the list, many painters wanted to produce historical paintings. The problem with this was that historical paintings were the most difficult to sell. To be able to live from their painting, many painters were forced to produce portraits or genre scenes, which sold much more easily. The hierarchy was as follows:"
"The Dutch concentrated heavily on the ""lower"" categories, but by no means rejected the concept of the hierarchy. Most paintings were relatively small – the only common type of really large paintings were group portraits. Painting directly onto walls hardly existed; when a wall-space in a public building needed decorating fitted framed canvas was normally used. For the extra precision possible on a hard surface many painters continued to use wooden panels, some time after the rest of Western Europe had abandoned them; some used copper plates, usually recycling plates from printmaking. In turn the number of surviving Golden Age paintings was reduced by them being overpainted with new works by artists throughout the 18th and 19th century – poor ones were usually cheaper than a new canvas, stretcher and frame. There was very little Dutch sculpture during the period; it is mostly found in tomb monuments and attached to public buildings, and small sculptures for houses are a noticeable gap, their place taken by silverware and ceramics. Painted delftware tiles were very cheap and common, if rarely of really high quality, but silver, especially in the auricular style, led Europe. With this exception, the best artistic efforts were concentrated on painting and printmaking."
Starving Time
"The Starving Time at Jamestown in Virginia Colony was a period of starvation during the winter of 1609–1610. During this time, all but 60 of the 500 colonists died. Lack of rain and access to water had crippled the agricultural production during the summer. Also, the water that the colonists drank was brackish and only drinkable half the year."
"According to historical accounts, the colonists ate dogs, snakes, cats, rats, horses, books and shoe leather through the winter. There is forensic evidence of at least one instance of cannibalism. The remains of a teenage girl ( 1595–1609), named ""Jane"" by researchers, showed signs of being butchered (cut up for eating). Examination of Jane's shin bone indicates she was probably 14 years old at the time of her death. Based on studies of the isotopes in a tooth, she was probably from southern England. She was possibly the daughter of a gentleman or a maid in a gentleman's home because she had consumed generous amounts of protein (meat). Jane likely arrived in Virginia in August 1609."
"It is almost certain Jane was removed from her grave before being butchered and eaten. She was not murdered. In 1625, George Percy, president of Jamestown during the starvation period, wrote that the hunger was so intense “thatt notheinge was Spared to mainteyne Lyfe and to doe those things which seame incredible, as to digge upp deade corpes outt of graves and to eate them."" Five other accounts refer to cannibalism during the bitter winter."
Only 10 percent of Jane's remains have been recovered by researchers. The remains were found about 2.5 feet (0.8 m) down in a trash pit in the cellar of a building built in 1608 inside the James Fort site. Historical accounts indicate cannibalism was widespread at Jamestown during the winter. Modern historians were reluctant to credit these accounts without other evidence. Jane however is the first forensic evidence that confirms the existence of the practice during that winter.

Oba Chandler
"Oba Chandler (October 11, 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio - November 15, 2011 in Raiford, Florida) was an American convicted murderer who was executed in Florida for the murders of Joan Rogers and her two teenage daughters. The women's bodies were found floating in the Tampa Bay, Tampa in June 1989. They had been bound and gagged and then tossed into the bay with concrete blocks tied to their necks while still alive."
"Billboards where at the later stages of the investigation used in trying to find however did the murders, the billboards that was spread all over Tampa had pictures of the Rogers women and a picture of the hand-writing of the suspected triple murderer. This method had never been used before, and became useful in searches for missing people later on."
"Chandler was arrested in September 1992. He was put on trial where he was found guilty of the murders by a 12-member jury. In November 4, 1994 he was sentenced to death by a deadly injection by the judge in the case. Before his execution, Chandler was locked up at Union Correctional Institution in Florida. Author Thomas French in 1998 won the Pulitzer Prize for his article series Angels &amp; Demons which told the story of the murders."
Background.
Early life.
"Oba Chandler was born in Cincinnati in the state of Ohio. He was the fourth of five children. His parents were Oba Chandler Sr. and Margaret Johnson. At the age of 10, Chandler's father Oba Chandler Senior hanged himself in the Chandler family's basement. This upset Oba so much that he jumped into his father's grave during the funeral in 1957 while gravediggers were covering the coffin with dirt. Afterwards, Oba's life spun out of control and he was arrested many times and had been arrested 20 times by the time he was a teenager. As an adult, he was charged with a long list of crimes, including theft, having fake money, burglary, kidnapping and armed robbery. Chandler would also father a total of eight children before his arrest, the latest one being Whitney born in February, 1989 with his wife at the time Debra Chandler. Between May and September of 1991 Chandler worked as an informant for the US customs Tampa office, at the same time as Tampa police investigated the Rogers family triple murder."
Facts of the murders.
"Joan Rogers and her two daughters, Michelle (17 years of age) and Christe (14 years of age) left their family dairy farm on May 26, 1989 in Willshire for a vacation in Florida."
"They had never before left the state of Ohio. On their last day in Florida they became lost and drove into Tampa to ask for directions to the nearest hotel, in a store they came across Oba Chandler and asked him. It is thought that he saw the Ohio state car license plates on Joan's car and used that as means to ask the family to join him out for a boat trip later."
The discovery of the bodies.
"The women's bodies were discovered floating in the Tampa Bay on June 4, 1989 with bound hands and feet with concrete blocks tied to their necks and duct tape over their mouths. The first body was found floating over the Sunshine Skyway bridge when a sailboat on its way home to Tampa after a trip to Key West, had just crossed under the Sunshine Skyway when many people on board saw an object in the water. They soon realized it was a dead body of a female. Soon another body was found and yet another third body was also dragged out of the bay within an hour. All three bodies had been tied and gagged and had concrete blocks tied around their necks. Autopsies thought the women had been tossed into the bay while still alive."
Investigation.
Subsequent investigaton.
"The Rogers women where identified a week after their bodies where found in the bay. A hotel maid had discovered that a hotel room had stood unused for several days. And when the reports about the murders started to leap into the media the hotel decided to contact investigators in the case. Soon it stood clear that it was indeed the families room after fingerprints where matched to those of the victims, some snaphots from a camera was also discovered in the room which showed where the family had traveled and also a last shot over Tampa Bay. This photo was taken just minutes before the Rogers women went out to meet Oba Chandler to go on a boat ride out on the bay."
Incriminating fact and arrest.
"The case remained unsolved and cold for several years, partly due to the volume of tips pouring in to the police who investigated the crime."
"Chandler would not be arrested for the murders until September 24, 1992. His handwritten directions and palmprint on a brochure found in the Rogers' vehicle, along with a description of his boat written by Jo Rogers on the brochure, were the primary clues that led to his being named a suspect. Also, authorities had posted the handwriting from the brochure on billboards, which was historic as it was used for the first time in an attempt to find the unknown killer, and this led to a tip from a former neighbor who was able to provide a copy of a work order that Chandler had written. A handwriting analysis conclusively matched the two."
Sentence and aftermath.
"The Rogers women were all buried on June 13, 1989 after a funeral service at the Zion Lutheral Church in their hometown of Willshire, Ohio. About 300 people among them family and friends of the victims attended the service. Numerous police officers were also present to keep all news media and crews out of the church during the funeral service, this because of the huge media interest for the case by media at the time. Chandler was tried and found guilty of the murders, and sentenced to death on November 4, 1994. After sentencing, the jury forewoman commented regarding the death sentence that ""They need to do this swiftly. The man is a mutation of a human being and he needs to be destroyed."" In July 2008, it was revealed that Chandler was on Florida's short-list of executions."
"Profiling experts believe that Chandler may have killed previously, based on the speculation that a first-time killer would not be experienced or bold enough to abduct and kill three women at once. Chandler remains a suspect in a 1982 murder of a woman found floating off Anna Maria Island, he is also a suspect in a rape case concerning a Canadian woman weeks before the Rogers women's murder. However, Chandler has never been charged with other murders. Chandler got an Institutional Adjustment disciplinary report on December 15, 2001, for disobeying orders in prison. All of Chandler's appeals since his 1994 conviction have been denied, the latest one in May 2007. Author Thomas French in 1998 won the Pulitzer prize for his article series Angels &amp; Demons which told the story of the murders."
Execution.
"Oba Chandler was executed on November 15, 2011 with a lethal injection at 4:25 pm in Florida State Prison in Raiford, Florida."
All Saints' Day
All Saints' Day is celebrated by Catholic Christians on November 1. Other Christians celebrate it as well. (May not be on the same day) It is a mandatory Catholic holiday. It is celebrated in the Catholic Church.
Charles Darwin's books
"Charles Darwin wrote about twenty books, including the most famous book in biology, the ""Origin of Species"". The books covered the natural history sciences, now called geology, palaeontology, zoology, botany, anthropology, psychology and evolutionary biology."
"The ""Origin of Species"" is the most important single book in the biological sciences, and its main ideas are well-supported by modern research."
"""The Voyage of the Beagle"" (1839) and ""The Descent of Man"" (1871) are also highly important."
Several of the other books were also ground-breaking.
Penelope Ann Miller
"Penelope Ann Miller (born Penelope Andrea Miller, January 13, 1964) is an American stage and movie actress. She has acted in numerous movies and television programs. Her father Mark Miller was an actor."
"She was born in Los Angeles, California on January 13, 1964. She has been married to Will Arnett from 1994 until they divorced in 1995. She is now married to James Huggins since 2000. With Miller she has two children."
Order of the Companions of Honour
"The Order of the Companions of Honour is a British award given to citizens of the Commonwealth. It was founded by King George V in 1917, as a reward for outstanding achievements in the arts, literature, music, science, politics, industry or religion."
"The order is limited to 65 ""Companions of Honour"". At first 45 members could be from the United Kingdom, 7 from Australia, 2 from New Zealand and 11 from other Commonwealth countries. Foreigners from outside the realm may be added as ""honorary members"". Membership of the order gives no title, or precedence, but recipients can put the post-nominal letters ""CH"" after their names."
"The insignia of the Order consists of an oval medallion with an oak tree, a shield with the royal arms hanging from one branch, and on the left a mounted knight in armour. The badge's clear blue border bears the motto ""IN ACTION FAITHFUL AND IN HONOUR CLEAR"". Men wear the badge on a ribbon (red with golden border threads) around their necks, and women on a bow at the left shoulder."
Culture jamming
"Culture jamming is a tactic by consumer social movements to either disrupt or subvert mainstream cultural institutions. It is also intended to expose dubious or substandard political thoughts on commercial culture. The tactics of culture jamming include refiguring fashion statements, product image and logos as means to challenge ideas about what is cool."
"The term ""culture jamming"" was first used around 1984."
Orchestra
"An orchestra is a group of musicians playing instruments together. They make music. A large orchestra is sometimes called a ""symphony orchestra"" and a small orchestra is called a ""chamber orchestra"". A symphony orchestra may have about 100 players, while a chamber orchestra may have 30 or 40 players. The number of players will depend on what music they are playing and the size of the place where they are playing. The word ""orchestra"" originally meant the semi-circular space in front of a stage in a Greek theatre which is where the singers and instruments used to play. Gradually the word came to mean the musicians themselves."
The conductor.
"The orchestra is directed by a conductor. He/she helps the players to play together, to get the right balance so that everything can be heard clearly, and to encourage the orchestra to play with the same kind of feeling. Some small chamber orchestras may play without a conductor. This was usual until the 19th century when the orchestras got very big and needed a conductor who made decisions and stood in front so that all the players could see him."
The instruments.
"The instruments of the orchestra are divided into districts: the strings, woodwind, brass and percussion. Each section (group of instruments) will have a player who is the ""Boss"". The principals will make decisions about seating arrangements, and about technical ways of playing the music: for example the principal of the string sections will make sure all the players move their bows up and down in the same direction. The violins are divided into first and second violins. The first violins usually have the tune while the seconds, most of the time, are part of the accompaniment. The principal of the first violin is the leader (or concertmaster) of the orchestra. In a professional orchestra they will be the most highly paid member of the orchestra."
The string family.
"The strings are the biggest section, although there are only five kinds of instruments: violin, viola, cello, double bass, and harp. This is because they are playing most of the time and usually form the basis of the music. If they are not playing the tune they will probably be accompanying. The first and second violins play different notes: the firsts usually have the tune. The strings sit at the front of the stage in a fan-shape in front of the conductor. The first violins are on the conductor's left, then come the second violins, then the violas and then the cellos. The double basses are behind the cellos. Some conductors prefer to have the second violins on their right and the cellos between the first violins and violas (see image of the Dohnanyi Orchestra)."
The woodwind family.
"The woodwind sit in one or two rows (depending on the size of the orchestra) behind the strings. There are five main woodwind instruments: flute, oboe, clarinet, saxophone, and bassoon. Each of these instruments also come in different versions:"
"The flute has a small version called the piccolo which plays an octave higher. It is the highest instrument in the orchestra. Occasionally there is an alto flute which is longer and plays a fifth (half an octave) lower than the flute. Most woodwind instruments need a reed, but the flute does not have a reed."
The bassoon has a larger version: the contrabassoon or double bassoon which sounds an octave lower. It is one of the lowest instruments in the orchestra.
"The clarinet has a larger version as well; the bass clarinet. It reaches the same depth as a bassoon. Usually only one is found in a modern orchestra. There is also an alto clarinet but because it plays the same part an alto saxophone plays, it is typically regarded as an unnecessary instrument."
"However, the Supreme Court can only review a case on appeal if it thinks the lower court's decision breaks a law or goes against the Constitution."
Jurisdiction over state courts.
"There is one specific power that Clause 2 does not give the federal judiciary. Clause 2 says that the federal judiciary has power over ""the laws of the United States."" However, it does ""not"" say that the federal courts have power over the laws of ""individual"" states. Also, when Congress passed the Judiciary Act of 1789, they also never gave the federal courts this power. This means that the federal courts can only review or change the decisions of state supreme courts if the state decision may have broken a federal law or the Constitution. The federal courts had no power to review or change state supreme court decisions that were just based on state laws. Basically, this gave each state supreme court the final say over the laws in their state. Different states could decide completely different things, so the laws might be completely different in one state than another."
Changes.
"In 1795, the Eleventh Amendment changed part of Clause 2. It took away the federal judiciary's power to get involved in lawsuits between states and citizens of other states or countries."
"In ""Marbury v. Madison"" (1803), the Supreme Court ruled that Congress cannot change the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction. However, the appellate jurisdiction of the Court is different. Congress is able to make the rules for the federal courts' appellate division, including rules about their jurisdictions."
"""Marbury v. Madison"" also created an important power called judicial review. This is the Supreme Court's ability to review whether a law, treaty, or executive rule breaks a law that already exists, a state Constitution, or the United States Constitution. After ""Marbury"", the Supreme Court started keeping an eye on what the state and federal governments were doing, instead of just trying cases that people brought to them."
"Clause 2 says that the Supreme Court has ""judicial power [over] all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution [and] the Laws of the United States..."" However, it does not say exactly what this means. The Supreme Court clarified this in a case called ""Osborn v. Bank of the United States"" (1824). Supreme Court Justice John Marshall wrote an opinion about what a ""federal"" case is, and what ""arising under"" the Constitution or federal laws means. Basically, he said a case is federal and under the federal courts' original jurisdiction if:"
Clause 3: Federal trials.
"Clause 3 of Section 2 says that federal crimes have to be tried in front of a jury, unless the defendant does not want a jury. The only type of federal crime that is not tried before a jury is an impeachment. (Article One, Section 3 of the Constitution says that only the United States Senate can try impeachment cases.)"
"Clause 3 also says the person's trial must be held in the state where they did the crime. If they did not do the crime in any particular state, then Congress gets to choose where the trial will be held."
Several of the Constitutional Amendments in the Bill of Rights talk more about the rights of people who are on trial in criminal or civil court.
Section 3: Treason.
Clause 1: Definition and conviction.
"The last section of Article 3 talks about treason and how it should be punished. The Founding Fathers wanted to make sure that Americans' rights were protected. They also knew that in the past, in England, some kings had gotten rid of their political opponents just by accusing them of treason. For these reasons, the Founders wanted to make sure the Constitution said specifically what crimes were treason; what would be needed to find people guilty; and what the punishments could be."
The Constitution is very specific about what crimes are treason:
"Section 3 also makes it clear that treason must be an ""overt act."" This means that to commit treason, a person must actually do something, not just plan to do it. For example, if a group of people got together and planned to attack part of the United States, that would not be treason because they had not actually done anything yet to hurt the country. If they did attack the United States, that would be an overt act, and it would be treason."
"It also says that there are only two ways for a person to be convicted of treason. Two different witnesses must say in court that they saw the person do that overt act. If there are not two witnesses, then the person must admit in court that they committed treason. If neither of these things happen, the person cannot be found guilty of treason. Parts of this rule came from a British law called the Treason Act 1695."
Clause 2: Punishment.
"Finally, Section 3 talks about punishment for people found guilty of treason. It gives Congress the power to decide the punishment. However, there is one punishment that the Constitution does not allow: punishing a person's family and descendants for that person's crime. In English law, if a person was convicted of treason, their punishment would include an ""Attainder"" (also called a ""Corruption of Blood""). This meant that not only the person, but their family and heirs, would be punished and thought of as guilty. Once a person was ""attainted,"" they would be executed. However, their heirs would also lose the right to inherit that person's land, property, or money."
"The end of Section 3 specifically says that this punishment is not allowed. When the Founders wrote ""no Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood, or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person attainted,"" they meant: ""No heirs may be punished, and Congress can make the traitor forfeit (give up) their property, but only during their lifetime."" Their heirs would have to be able to inherit their property when the traitor died."
Ralph Ketner
"Ralph W. Ketner (September 20, 1920 – May 29, 2016) was an American businessman and philanthropist. He was known for being the founder of Food Lion (founded as Food Town). He founded the grocery store chain in the 1950s. During his career, Ketner has given away 35% of his profit to charity."
"Ketner was born in Rimertown, North Carolina. He grew up during the Great Depression. He studied at Tri-State College in Angola, Indiana. Ketner is married to Anne Blizzard. They have two children. In March 2016, Ketner was hospitalized and diagnosed with colon cancer. He died on May 29, 2016 in Salisbury, North Carolina from the disease at the age of 95."
Samuel H. Young
"Samuel Hollingsworth Young (December 26, 1922 – September 23, 2017) was an American politician. He was a U.S. Representative from Illinois. He represented Illinois's 10 congressional district as a Republican. He served as a representative from January 3, 1973 through January 3, 1975. He was replaced by Abner J. Mikva."
"Young was born in Casey, Illinois. He studied at the University of Illinois. Young died at his home in Glenview, Illinois on September 23, 2017 from complications of Alzheimer's disease at the age of 94."
Louise Arner Boyd
"Louise Arner Boyd (September 16, 1887 – September 14, 1972) was an American explorer. She explored Greenland and the Arctic. She wrote many articles about her journeys and published two successful books."
Belongings.
"The Ustaše took away all of the inmates' clothes and other things. They were given only prison uniforms, made out of rags. In winter, inmates were given thin ""rain-coats,"" and they were allowed to make light sandals. Inmates were given a small personal food bowl, to hold the 0.4 litres of ""soup"" they were fed. An inmate whose bowl was missing (because another inmate had stolen it to use it as a toilet) would get no food."
"During delegation visits, inmates were given bowls twice as large as usual, with spoons. Also, during these visits, inmates were given colored tags."
Anxiety.
"Prisoners were affected by a constant fear of death, and terrible stress of being in a situation in which the living and dead are very close together."
"When they first arrived at the camp, inmates would be shocked by the terrible conditions on the trip to the camp, and in the camp itself. The Ustaše would increase this shock by murdering a number of inmates as soon as they got to the camp, and by temporarily housing new-arrivals in warehouses, attics, in the train tunnel and outdoors."
"After the inmates grew familiar with life in camp, they would have to get used to living through the hardships, abuse, torture, and deaths of other prisoners. The danger of death was greatest during ""public performances for public punishment,"" also called selections. Inmates would be lined up in groups, and individuals would be randomly pointed out to be killed while facing the rest. The Ustaše would make this worse by making the process take a long time. They would walk around and ask questions; gaze at inmates; choose one person, then change their mind and choose another."
"Inmates reacted to being in Jasenovac in two basic ways. Some became activists. They formed resistance movements (groups who tried to fight the Ustaše in different ways, like stealing food, planning escapes and revolts, and trying to get in touch with people outside the camp). But most of the inmates reacted by just trying to survive, and get through the day unharmed. This was not ""going in line to slaughter,"" but rather another strategy to try to survive."
"All inmates suffered from some kind of mental health problems. Some could not stop thinking about food; others became paranoid; some had delusions; some lost control of themselves. Others seemed to lose their sense of hope. Some inmates reacted by trying to write about what was happening to them. For example, Nikola Nikolić, Djuro Schwartz, and Ilija Ivanović all tried to memorize and even write about events, dates and details. This was very dangerous, since writing was punishable by death and tracking dates was hard."
"Most of the executions of Jews at Jasenovac occurred before August 1942. After that, the ISC started to deport Jewish prisoners to the Auschwitz concentration camp. In general, Jews were first sent to Jasenovac from all parts of Croatia after being gathered in Zagreb, and from Bosnia and Herzegovina after being gathered in Sarajevo. Some, however, were sent directly to Jasenovac from other cities and smaller towns."
Systematic extermination of prisoners.
"Many inmates sent to Jasenovac were scheduled to be murdered. Strong men who could do hard work, and were sentenced to less than 3 years in prison, were allowed to live. However, anyone who was sentenced to 3 years in prison or longer was immediately scheduled for execution."
"The Ustaše used many different kinds of systematic extermination (killing many people at once, using a system). However, they liked using manual methods of killing - killing prisoners with their hands, using tools like knives, saws, and hammers."
Cremation.
"The Ustaše cremated living inmates. Some were given drugs, but others were fully awake. They also cremated dead bodies."
"When the Ustaše first started cremating people in January 1942, they used brick factory ovens. An engineer named Hinko Dominik Picilli made cremation much easier for them by creating seven better-working crematories."
"Crematories were also placed in Gradina, across the Sava River. The State Commission says ""there is no information that [the Gradina crematory] ever went into operation."" Later testimony, however, says this crematory was used."
Some bodies were buried rather than cremated. Their bodies were dug up late in the war.
Gassing and poisoning.
"The Nazis had used poison gas to kill many prisoners in their concentration camps. Following this example, the Ustaše tried to use poison gas to kill inmates that arrived in Stara-Gradiska. At first, they tried to gas the women and children that arrived from camp Djakovo with gas-vans that Simo Klaić called ""green Thomas"". Later, they built gas chambers and used Zyklon-B and sulphur monoxide to kill prisoners."
Granik.
"Granik was a ramp used to unload goods from boats on the Sava River. In winter 1943-44, prisoners who did farming work had no jobs to do, since the ground was frozen. Meanwhile, large numbers of new prisoners arrived. By this time, the Axis powers were expected to lose World War II, and the Ustaše wanted to kill as many people as possible before that happened. They decided to execute people on the ramp, so that after they were killed, their bodies could be dumped into the river."
"Every night for about 20 days, Ustaše officers brought in lists of prisoners who they planned to execute. They stripped, chained, and beat these prisoners. Then they took them to the Granik. There, weights were tied to them; their intestines and necks were cut; they were hit in the head; and then they were thrown into the river. Over time, the Ustaše changed this method, so that inmates were tied in pairs, back to back, and their bellies were cut open before they were tossed into the river alive."
Gradina and Ustice.
"Gradina and Ustice were villages around Jasenovac. The Ustaše chose some empty areas near these villages, and used wire to mark off an area for a massacre and mass graves. They gathered many prisoners there and killed them with knives or by smashing their skulls with hammers."
"When Roma people (Gypsies) arrived in the camp, they did not undergo selection, because they were all scheduled to be killed. They were taken to Gradina. In between massacres, the men would be forced to work on the dike, and the women would be forced to work in the cornfields in Ustice. Eventually, they would all be killed. Thus Gradina and Ustice became Roma mass grave sites. The Ustaše killed more and more people Gradina, until it became the main killing-ground in Jasenovac. Grave-sites were also located in nearby Ustica and in Draksenic."
Mlaka and Jablanac.
"Mlaka and Jablanac were used as camps where women and children were held and forced to work. However, many women, children, and men were killed at the Sava River bank between the two camps."
Velika Kustarica.
"According to the State Commission, as many as 50,000 people were killed here in the winter of 1941 to 1942. Evidence says that more people were also killed here after that winter."
"August 29, 1942, mass murder."
"In the late summer of 1942, the ISC sent tens of thousands of Serbian villagers were to Jasenovac. The villagers had lived in the Kozara mountain area (in Bosnia), where ISC soldiers were fighting against the Yugoslav Partisans. The women villagers were sent to do forced labor in Germany. Children were taken from their mothers and either killed or sent to Catholic orphanages. However, most of the men were killed at Jasenovac."
"At the time of his death in 1616, only some of Shakespeare’s plays had been published in single editions. His plays were collected and published in 1623, seven years after he died. There is proof that people in Shakespeare's time thought highly of him. After his death, even his rival Ben Jonson said:"
"Shakespeare was involved in the building of the Globe Theatre in 1599. (It burned down a few years later.) His plays are still performed at a new Globe Theatre, built in 1997 near the original."
Marriage and sexuality.
"Although Shakespeare was married to a woman and fathered three children, people have questioned his sexuality. Some people, such as Peter Holland of the Shakespeare Institute at Birmingham University, have pointed out that Shakespeare directed some of his sonnets towards young men. They say this is evidence that he may have been bisexual."
"Who wrote ""Shakespeare""?"
"About 150 years after his death, some writers suggested that Shakespeare did not actually write all of the works that are called his. They had various reasons for saying this. For example, the person who wrote ""Shakespeare’s works"" knew a lot about other countries (especially Italy and France), but William Shakespeare never left England. Several other writers of ""Shakespeare"" have been suggested, such as Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe, and Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. However, most scholars believe that William Shakespeare did write the works that bear his name."
Palaestra
"A palaestra was a building in ancient Greece. It is the place where wrestling was taught and practiced. It consisted of a large square or rectangular courtyard. This courtyard was open to the sky. It was surrounded by colonnades. Off these colonnades were dressing rooms, lecture rooms, bath rooms, and rooms for storing equipment. Wrestlers practiced under the colonnades in all weathers."
"Palaestras were often near gymnasiums. They were sometimes a part of gymnasium complexes. Most cities in the Greek world had a palaestra. Large cities may have had several. Some palaestras were privately owned. Most were built with taxes. The palaestra was very much a part of the everyday lives of Greek men and boys. Some men felt as much affection for the palaestra they grew up in as modern men feel for their ""alma mater"". Some men were buried in their favorite palaestra."
What was a palaestra?
"A palaestra was a building in ancient Greece where wrestling was taught and practiced. The word ""palaestra"" is based on the Greek word ""pale"", which means wrestling. From the sixth century BC through the end of the Roman Imperial age, palaestras were built throughout Greece. The earliest ones were privately owned, but by the fifth century BC public ones were being built. Almost every Greek city had at least one palaestra and some large cities had several."
"Palaestras were often located near or were attached to gymnasiums. The gymnasium probably first appeared in the sixth century BC. Both were often referred to simply as ""the gymnasium"". Greek historian, biographer, and essayist Plutarch writes that a palaestra was used solely for wrestling and the ""pankration"", a sport similar to but much rougher than wrestling. Boxing was taught and practiced in the gymnasium. Retired athletes owned and operated small palaestras. Greek males of all ages joined palaestras. Elderly (old) men sometimes had their own palaestras."
Design of the palaestra.
"Vitruvius was a Roman architect who lived in the age of Augustus. He made a plan for the perfect palaestra in his book ""On Architecture"". This palaestra is similar to the one at Olympia, Greece, the site of the ancient Olympic Games. Vitruvius' palaestra has a large courtyard open to the sky. This courtyard is surrounded by roofed colonnades."
"The yard would have been filled with ""skammata""pits where wrestlers and pankratiasts would have practiced. A ""skamma"" (""dug-up part"") was an area where the soil had been turned over and covered with a thick layer of sand to provide a firm foundation for the wrestlers. Because wrestlers may have had to compete in rainy weather, there were two ""skamma"" in the palaestra: a dry one and a wet one. Wrestlers called the mud in the wet ""skamma"" ""beeswax""."
"The wrestlers themselves turned over the soil and sand with a pick axe. This was considered a meaningful exercise and the pick axe became a symbol for wrestling in Greek art. It is likely the wet ""skamma"" was located under the colonnades to prevent evaporation. Greek physicians thought a mixture of mud and oil had curative powers and a mixture of mud and oil was often used in the pits."
"Vitruvius describes single colonnades on three sides of the yard and a double colonnade on the north side. This double colonnade would protect the room behind it from sun and rain. The palaestra was a place for training the body and the mind. This room was the ""ephebeion"". It was here that young men (""ephebes"") would receive instruction on Greek culture. Stone benches would have been set into the walls."
"To the right of the ""ephebeion"" Vitruvius would have had three rooms: the punching bag room, the dust and powder room, and a room for bathing. To the left of the ""ephebeion"" would be a room for storing oil, and a group of rooms for a furnace and hot baths. Hot baths were a Roman necessity and were not found at Olympia however. This may have been because of the scarcity of water at Olympia. The baths at Olympia were simple but those at Delphi were large and elaborate."
"Vitruvius does not mention the undressing room (""apodyterion"") but there certainly would have been at least one in every palaestra. ""Pale"" and ""pankration"" were both practiced in the nude. Vitruvius does not mention a ball room (""sphairisterion"") either, which some palaestra had. It is not known if this room was used for ball games, storage, or exercise."
"On rainy days, wrestling was taught and practiced beneath the two to four roofed colonnades that lined the yard. Just off these colonnades were dressing rooms, rooms for bathing, storage rooms, and rooms for lectures and meeting friends. These rooms were often used for homosexual or pederastic trysts."
"Hermes Enagonios (""Hermes of the Contest"") presided over the palaestra. He was depicted on a rectangular piece of marble as a head and an erect penis. Hermes was the god of wrestling and sometimes said to be the father of Palaestra, the goddess of wrestling. In Greek art, a herm often indicates the scene is a palaestra. Statues of Apollo and Herakles also stood in a palaestra."
Life in the palaestra.
"Wrestling was a highly esteemed sport in ancient Greece. It was less rough than boxing or the pankration, required less space than other sports, and, as a result, was the most popular sport among athletes. References to the sport are frequent in the literature of ancient Greece, especially poetry."
"Males of all ages joined palaestras, just as modern men and boys join the YMCA, gyms, or health clubs. Greek men developed an affection for the gymnasiums and the palaestras where they grew up, and some were buried in their favorite gymnasium or palaestra. These buildings could be a center for politics: the plot to free Thebes from Sparta was formed in a palaestra and a revolt against Macedon found its supporters in the gymnasiums and palaestras of Argos."
"Some people were not allowed in the palaestra. These included the ""paidogogos""older slaves or grandfathers who led young boys to the palaestra and waited for them near the front door. Others not allowed in the palaestra included girls and women, cripples, alcoholics, craftsmen, vendors (salesmen), slaves or freed slaves, the insane, and openly lewd homosexuals. Death was not unknown in the palaestra. One wrestler fell on a hard surface and died ten days later from chest injuries."
"Every palaestra had a number of handsome young men called ""prosgymnastes"". They waited around offering to wrestle others for a fee. These young men were known casually as ""statues"". Wrestling one was known as ""hugging a statue"". These young men were not held in high esteem."
"In a place where men, young men, and boys were nude, homosexual interaction was common. The authorities tried unsuccessfully to curb it. Greek vase paintings of males in the palaestra show teens goosing each other or older males offering love gifts such as hares to teens. In ""Lysis"", the Athenian philosopher Sokrates is pulled into a palaestra by a group of teenagers. They tell him that one of their number is in love with another. Most Greek males considered a homosexual relationship a positive palaestra experience. Archaeologist Stephen Miller writes that Eros was worshipped as much as Hermes and Herakles in the palaestra."
Black-tailed rattlesnake
"The Black-tailed rattlesnake (""Crotalus Molossus"") is a species of venomous Pit vipers, found in southwestern United States of America and Mexico. There are currently three subspecies recognized."
Description.
"This publicity became a problem for Holding. The leaders at Kiwirrkurra were angry with him for giving the story to the press. The newspaper had published photographs of the family members without their permission. It had caused other reporters to try to enter their community to get information. They also did not agree with how the media was defining the event. The little information the press had been given had led to romanticised reports of a ""first contact"" or a ""discovery"". But from the Pintupi point of view, the family were relatives whom they knew and had a history with. As they saw it, the group had not been ""discovered"", but were just coming back together after being separated."
Health.
"When they had first arrived, a doctor from Kintore had examined the family and decided they were strong, fit, and very healthly. But in a few days time, they all got sick. They did not have any natural immunity to diseases. Holding wanted a government team of medical specialists to treat them. But Kiwirrkurra's leaders would not let any other doctors look at the family. The only people who were allowed to treat them were the local ""ngangkari"" (medicine man) and the doctor at Kintore."
"At this time, the Pintupi still blamed government doctors for the deaths of many of their people who had come in from the desert during the 1960s. These people had died from infection and disease, and Holding was trying to avoid this happening again. By early November, serious concerns about the survival of the family were being raised. The secretary of the department of Aboriginal Affairs, Charles Perkins, strongly criticised the Kiwirrkurra leaders for violating the family's civil rights. He said that if they did not get the proper medical care, all nine of them would die within two months."
"The doctor at Kintore thought that it was the Pintupi's responsibility to decide what was best for their own. They trusted him, and let him treat the family. All nine of the family members had caught coughs and a bacterial infection called treponema. The doctor treated them and gave them several immunisations. They eventually became healthy again."
Today.
"The eldest brother, Piyiti, returned to the desert in 1986. He left in secret and covered his tracks so nobody could follow him. It is not clear why he left, or whether anyone knows why. One local claimed it was because he had heard stories about Pintupi people dying from diseases, and was afraid it would happen to him. McMahon thinks it was because he found it hard to adapt (adjust) to things—particularly conflict, since he had lived all his life with his family. There are different theories about what happened to Piyiti. Some people think he is still living in the desert. Warlimpirrnga, in an interview in 2004, claimed to have seen Piyiti in Alice Springs, and said he now calls himself ""Yari Yari""."
"The others stayed at Kiwirrkura for many years. In 1998, Papalya died from kidney failure. She was probably almost 70 when she died, and was buried in Kiwirrkura. Nanu died in March 2001, also close to 70 years old. Because of a major flood at Kiwirrkura at the time, she was buried in Kintore."
"The six remaining members became painters of the Papunya Tula school. The three brothers—Warlimpirrnga, Tamayinya (now known as Thomas) and Walala—now live mostly in Alice Springs. Their paintings have often sold for several thousands of dollars. Warlimpirrnga, particularly, is one of the most well-known artists of the Western Desert style. He has paintings in several national art galleries across the country. He and Yalti have three children. Except for Thomas, they are all married with children. Takariya separated from Freddy West and remarried. Yalti, Yukultji and Takariya still live in Kiwirrkurra. All six of them still speak only Pintupi."
The family became the last group of people living a traditional hunter-gatherer lifestyle in Australia. They were the last Aboriginal people to make contact with modern civilisation.
Walala Tjapaltjarri
Walala Tjapaltjarri (born Walala Tjapangati) is an Australian Aboriginal artist. He is one of the most well-known artists of the Western Desert style.
Early life.
"Walala was born in the late 1960s or early 1970s. He was born at Marua, near Lake Mackay. He grew up living a nomadic, traditional way of life in the desert. His family had never come into contact with modern, Euro-Australian society. He had never seen a white person, and his family always thought the aeroplanes they saw flying overhead were ghosts or spirits. Before Walala was born, his father Lanti had lived for a short time at the mission in Balgo. But he had run away after getting into trouble for stealing food. It was his decision to stay in the desert, and kept his family far away from the towns. Walala's mother was named Watjunka, and he was Watjunka's only child. He also had two other mothers, Papunya and Nanu, who were his father's secondary wives (and his mother's sisters). His father and Watjunka both died when he was young. The family finally came into contact with outsiders in October 1984, and were settled at Kiwirrkurra. He and his family became known as the last Aborigines living a traditional nomadic way of life in Australia."
"He is now married with two children, and lives between Kiwirrkura, Alice Springs, and Yuendumu, where his wife is from. He paints at Hoppy's Camp, outside Alice Springs."
Painting.
"Walala began painting in December 1987, a few years after settling at Kiwirrkurra. He was introduced to painting by his cousin Warlimpirrnga. He taught Walala about using paints and canvas. Walala joined the Papunya Tula artists, and he, Thomas and Warlimpirrnga eventually gained fame internationally as the Tjapaltjarri Brothers. Although he normally paints using ""Tjapaltjarri"" as a surname, Walala's skin name is ""Tjapangati""."
"His paintings depict scenes from the Tingari cycle (sacred and secret songs about the ancestors of the Pintupi). He uses only four colours at most, sticking to earthy, ochre colours to reflect the desert landscape. The places he depicts in his paintings are part of his traditional country, including Marruwa, Mintarnpi, Wanapatangu, Mina Mina, Naami, Yarrawangu and Wilkinkarra (Lake Mackay). These were places where the ancestors stopped for ceremonies when travelling across the country."
"Walala uses acrylic paintings on canvas. His early work was in the flowing ""dot"" style of painting typical of the Papunya Tula artists. His style became different during the late 1990s, and began to paint rigid rectangles, replacing dotted lines with thick, solid lines."
"His first exhibition was in 1997, for the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award in Darwin. Most of his work is shown in exhibitions alongside the works of other Aboriginal artists. He has paintings in permanent collections in Australia, Europe and the United States. Walala paints the most out of the three Tjapaltjarri brothers. When painting regularly, he earns up to AU$2000 a day. His paintings often sell for many thousands of dollars."
Thomas Tjapaltjarri
"Thomas Tjapaltjarri (born Tamayinya Tjapangati, also often known as Tamlik) is an Australian Aboriginal artist. He and his brothers Warlimpirrnga and Walala have become well-known as the Tjapaltjarri Brothers. Thomas and his family became known as the last group of Aborigines to come into contact with modern, European society. They came out of the desert in 1984, and became known as ""the last nomads""."
Early life.
"Thomas was born in the desert of Western Australia sometime in the 1960s. He and his family lived a traditional nomadic way of life on the western side of Lake Mackay. They had never come into contact with European society. Most other Pintupi families had been settled in remote towns to the east and west of their traditional country during the 1950s. Thomas' father, Lanti (or ""Joshua""), had lived for a short time at the mission in Balgo, but he had run away after getting into trouble for stealing food. It was his decision to stay in the desert, and kept his family far away from the towns."
"Thomas' mother was named Nanu. He also had two other mothers, Papunya and Watjunka, who were his father's secondary wives. He had two younger sisters, Yalti and Yukultji, a younger half-brother Walala, and four other ""siblings"" (cousins by blood relation). His father died sometime around 1980. The family finally came into contact with outsiders in October 1984, and were settled at Kiwirrkurra. The event was big news at the time, and the family became famously known as ""the last nomads"". Thomas was diagnosed with epilepsy shortly after this."
Painting.
"Thomas began painting in December 1987, a few years after settling at Kiwirrkurra. His cousin Warlimpirrnga had already made a name for himself as an artist and he encouraged Thomas to paint too. Thomas and Walala joined the Papunya Tula artists, and they and Warlimpirrnga eventually gained fame internationally as the Tjapaltjarri Brothers. Although he normally paints using ""Tjapaltjarri"" as a surname, Thomas' skin name is ""Tjapangati""."
"His paintings depict stories from the Pintupi dreaming. They are mostly about places and events in the Tingari cycle (a cycle of myths about the ancestors of the Pintupi). His designs are inspired by those painted on the body during ceremonies. He uses acrylic paints on canvas, sticking to earthy colours (black, white and ochres). He paints simple shapes with dotted lines, which is a style that his brothers also use."
"He has had paintings shown in many exhibitions around Australia, and also in Switzerland, Germany, France and the United States. His larger paintings sell for at least AU$6000 in Alice Springs and AU$9500 in galleries in Melbourne and Sydney."
Slavery.
"""Uncle Tom's Cabin""'s most important theme is the evil of slavery. Every part in ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" develops the characters and the story. But most importantly, it always tries to show the reader that slavery is evil, un-Christian, and should not be allowed. One way Stowe showed the evil of slavery was how it forced families from each other."
Motherhood.
"Stowe thought mothers were the ""model for all of American life"". She also believed that only women could save the United States from slavery. Because of this, another very important theme of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" is the moral power and sanctity of women. White women like Mrs. Bird, St. Clare’s mother, Legree’s mother, and Mrs. Shelby try to make their husbands help their slaves. Eva, who is the ""ideal Christian"", says that blacks and whites are the same. Black women like Eliza are brave and pious. She escapes from slavery to save her son, and by the end of the novel, has made her whole family come together again. Some critics said that Stowe's female characters are often unrealistic. However, Stowe's novel made many people remember ""the importance of women's influence"" and helped the women's rights movement later."
Christianity.
"Stowe's puritanical religious beliefs are also one of the biggest themes in the novel. She explores what Christianity is like. She believed that the most important thing in Christianity was love for everyone. She also believed that Christian theology shows that slavery is wrong. This theme can be seen when Tom urges St. Clare to ""look away to Jesus"" after St. Clare's daughter Eva dies. After Tom dies, George Shelby says, ""What a thing it is to be a Christian."" Because Christian themes are so important, and because Stowe often directly spoke in the novel about religion and faith, the novel is written in the ""form of a sermon."""
Style.
"""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" is written in a sentimental and melodramatic style. This style was often used in the 19th century sentimental novel and domestic fiction (also called women's fiction). These genres were the most popular novels of Stowe's time. It usually had female characters and a style that made readers feel sympathy and emotion for them. Stowe's novel is different from other sentimental novels because she writes about a large theme like slavery. It is also different because she has a man (Uncle Tom) as the main character. However, she still tried to make her readers have strong feelings when they read ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"", like making them cry when Eva died. This kind of writing made readers react powerfully. For instance, Georgiana May, a friend of Stowe's, wrote a letter to the writer. In the letter, she said that ""I was up (awake) last night long after one o'clock, reading and finishing ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"". I could not leave it any more than I could have left a dying child."" Another reader said that she thought about the book all the time and even thought about changing her daughter's name to Eva. The death of Eva affected lots of people. In 1852, 300 baby girls in Boston were named Eva."
"Even though many readers were very moved, literary critics did not like the style in ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" and other sentimental novels. They said these books were written by women and had ""women's sloppy (messy) emotions."" One literary critic said that if the novel not been about slavery, ""it would be just another sentimental novel"". Another said the book was a ""piece of hack (messy) work."" In ""The Literary History of the United States"", George F. Whicher called ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" ""Sunday-school fiction""."
"However, in 1985 Jane Tompkins wrote differently about ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" in her book ""In Sensational Designs: The Cultural Work of American Fiction."" Tompkins praised ""Uncle Tom's Cabin""'s style. She said that sentimental novels showed how women's emotions changed the world in a good way. She also said that the popular domestic novels written in the 19th century, like ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"", were intelligently written. She also said that ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" shows a ""critique of American society far more devastating (powerful) than any ... by better-known critics such as Hawthorne and Melville."""
Reactions to the novel.
"""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" has had a very great influence. There are not many novels in history that changed society so powerfully. When it was published, ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"", people who defended slavery were very angry and protested against it. Some people even wrote books against it. Abolitionists praised it very much. As a best-seller, the novel greatly influenced later protest literature."
Contemporary and world reaction.
"As soon as it was published, ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" made people in the American South very angry. The novel was also greatly criticized by people who supported slavery."
"A famous novelist from the South, William Gilmore Simms, said that the book was not true. Others called the novel criminal and said it was full of lies. A person who sold books in Mobile, Alabama had to leave town for selling the novel. Stowe received threatening letters. She even received a package with a slave's cut ear once. Many Southern writers, like Simms, soon began writing their own books about slavery."
"Some critics said that Stowe had never actually went to a Southern plantation and she did not know much about Southern life. They said that because of this, she made wrong descriptions about the South. However, Stowe always said she made the characters of her book by stories she was told by slaves that ran away to Cincinnati, Ohio, where she lived. It is reported: ""She observed firsthand (herself) several incidents (happenings) which ... [inspired] her to write [the] famous anti-slavery novel. Scenes she observed (saw) on the Ohio River, including seeing a husband and wife being sold apart, as well as newspaper and magazine accounts and interviews, contributed material to the ... plot."""
"In 1853, Stowe published ""A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin"". This was to show the people who had criticized the novel's description of slavery that it was true. In the book, Stowe writes about the important characters in ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" and about people in real life who were like them. Through this book, she writes a more ""aggressive attack on slavery in the South than the novel itself had"". Like the novel, ""A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin"" was also a best-seller. However, many of the works in ""A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin"" was read by Stowe after she published her novel."
"Even though there were such criticisms, the novel was still very popular. Stowe's son says that when Abraham Lincoln met her in 1862 Lincoln said, ""So this is the little lady who started this great war."" Historians are not sure if Lincoln really said this or not. In a letter that Stowe wrote to her husband a few hours after meeting with Lincoln, she does not say anything about this sentence. After this, many writers have said that this novel helped make the North angry at slavery and at the Fugitive Slave Law. It greatly helped the abolitionist movement. Union general and politician James Baird Weaver said that the book made him help in the abolitionist movement."
"""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" also interested many people in England. The first London edition came out in May 1852. It sold 200,000 copies. Some of this interest was because at that time the British people did not like the United States. A writer said, ""The evil passions which 'Uncle Tom' gratified in England were not hatred or vengeance [of slavery], but national jealousy and national vanity. We have long been smarting (hurting) under the conceit of America – we are tired of hearing her boast that she is the freest and the most enlightened country that the world has ever seen. Our clergy hate her voluntary system – our Tories hate her democrats – our Whigs hate her ... All parties hailed Mrs. Stowe as a revolter from the enemy."" Charles Francis Adams, the American minister to Britain during the war, said later that, """"Uncle Tom's Cabin""; or ""Life among the Lowly"", published in 1852, influenced the world more quickly, powerfully, and dramatically than any other book ever printed."""
"""Uncle Tom’s Cabin"" was published in Russia at the end of 1857 and was soon recognized as a classic of world literature. Many people saw a very strong link between the world of ""Uncle Tom’s Cabin"" and the serfdom that still existed in Russia in 1850s. In his letter to an abolitionist Maria Weston Chapman, Nikolay Turgenev wrote, “Many of the scenes described in the book seem like an exact depiction of equally frightful scenes in Russia.” ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" served as an educational tool for Russian and Russo-Soviet elite in the post emancipation period, and it also became part of Soviet children literature."
"The book has been translated into almost every language. For example, it was translated into Chinese. Its translator Lin Shu made this the first Chinese translation of an American novel. It was also translated into Amharic. Its 1930 translation was made to help Ethiopia end the suffering of blacks in that nation. The book was read by so many people that Sigmund Freud believed that some of his patients had been influenced by reading about the whipping of slaves in ""Uncle Tom's Cabin""."
Literary importance and criticism.
"""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" was the first widely read political novel in the United States. It greatly influenced American literature and protest literature. Some later books that were greatly influenced by ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" are ""The Jungle"" by Upton Sinclair and ""Silent Spring"" by Rachel Carson."
"However, even though ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" was very important, many people thought the book was a mix of ""children's fable and propaganda"". Many critics called the book ""merely (only) a sentimental novel"". George Whicher wrote in his ""Literary History of the United States"" that ""Nothing attributable to Mrs. Stowe or her handiwork can account for the novel's enormous (great) vogue (popularity); its author's resources ... of Sunday-school fiction were not remarkable ... melodrama, humor, and pathos … compounded (made up) her book."""
"Other critics, though, have praised the novel. Edmund Wilson said that ""To expose oneself in maturity (when one has grown up) to Uncle Tom's Cabin may … prove a startling (surprising) experience."" Jane Tompkins said that the novel is one of the classics of American literature. She suggested that literary critics think badly of the book because it was simply too popular when it came out."
"Through the years, people have wondered what Stowe was trying to say with the novel. Some of her themes can be seen easily, like the evil of slavery. However, some themes are harder to see. For example, Stowe was a Christian and active abolitionist, and put lots of her religious beliefs in her book. Some have said that Stowe wrote in her novel what she thought was a solution to the problem that worried many people who did not like slavery. This problem was: was doing things that were not allowed justified if they did it to fight evil? Was it right to use violence to stop the violence of slavery? Was breaking laws that helped slavery right? Which of Stowe's characters should be followed: the patient Uncle Tom or the defiant George Harris? Stowe thought that God's will would be followed if each (every) person sincerely (truly) examined his principles and acted on (followed) them."
"People have also thought ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" expressed the ideas of the Free Will Movement. In this idea, the character of George Harris symbolizes the free labor. The complex character of Ophelia shows the Northerners who allowed slavery, even though they did not like it. Dinah is very different from Ophelia. She acts by passion. In the book, Ophelia changes. Like Ophelia, the Republican Party (three years later) declared that the North must change itself. It said that the North must stop slavery actively."
"Feminist theory can also be seen in Stowe's book. The novel can be seen as criticizing slavery's patriarchal nature. For Stowe, families were related by blood, not by family-like relations between masters and slaves. Stowe also saw the nation as a bigger ""family"". So, the feelings of nationality came from sharing the same race. Because of this, she supported the idea that freed slaves should live together in a colony."
"The book has also been seen as trying to show that masculinity was important in stopping slavery. Abolitionists began to change the way they thought of violent men. They wanted men to help stop slavery without hurting their self-image or their position in society. Because of this, some abolitionists followed some of the principles of women's suffrage, peace, and Christianity. They praised men for helping, working together, and having mercy. Other abolitionists were more traditional: they wanted men to act more forcefully. All the men in Stowe's book show either patient men or traditional men."
Creation and popularization of stereotypes.
"Recently, some people have begun criticizing the book for what they thought were racist descriptions of the book's black characters. They criticized the way Stowe wrote about the characters' looks, speech, behavior, and the passive nature of Uncle Tom. The book's use of common stereotypes about African Americans is important because ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" was the best-selling novel in the world in the 19th century. Because of this, the book (together with images in the book and related stage productions) helped make a great number of people accept such stereotypes."
"Among the African-American stereotypes in ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" are:"
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
and you can do a
it makes things very convenient.
"You can save a lot of money, too. Certainly cut down on long distance charges if you, if that's what you have in mind."
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"I've never tried using that,"
I don't know too much about it.
"What about,"
"have you, did you use commercially available software"
"or,"
"I have, I have used Lotus."
"I have used, uh, Word Perfect"
Uh-huh.
"uh, I,"
not heavy use.
"I've used, uh, D Base"
"and, uh, I've used a substantial amount of shareware."
"Um, I haven't done much Lotus work connected with my job."
I've been through three classes
Uh-huh.
and I have a great deal of respect for it.
Uh-huh.
"Um, I haven't done much word processing work with my job."
I do some
Uh-huh.
"and I,"
and the D Base work I've done was strictly class related.
"I've never used D Base, um,"
but I've heard both good things and bad things about it.
"Well, it's probably the granddaddy of most, uh, data base management systems."
"Okay,"
"well, that's good, because I didn't like Oklahoma that well"
"Okay,"
so what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning products?
"Uh, not too bad really."
"Uh, I had a razor that I got from Christmas that I just, I really didn't want it,"
but I got it anyway
"and, uh, it was a Braun"
and they were real good about taking it back.
"It wasn't a problem at all,"
"so, uh, I was able to get that back pretty easily."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, I don't know,"
I really haven't returned a whole lot lately.
Have you?
I haven't had to.
"It's, uh, the,"
"every so often,"
"I mean, I, I, I'm almost pushing it myself."
Maybe I'll buy a shirt from G I Joe's
and it shrinks too much
"and say, well, I should have known better,"
"I mean, I bought it from G I Joe's"
Um.
and it was probably made in China by slaves.
Right
"But, uh, they, uh,"
"most of the time pretty careful shopping anyway, I get pretty good stuff."
Yeah.
"I think that, uh, aside from the fact all markets being internationalized"
Right
"like,"
Yeah.
"You know something must be wrong as far as, uh, not just the teaching techniques but just motivation, within, within the schools themselves."
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"excuse me just a minute, uh,"
Uh-huh.
I'm on the other line Karen.
I'm sorry.
"Oh, it's okay."
Okay.
"Uh, she, uh,"
"yeah,"
"well the, the results,"
"I, I hear what you're, you're saying about the results."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, it's, what to do about it I guess is the, the big thing."
Yeah.
"I'm, I'm in a kind of an interesting situation in that my, my wife teaches school here in Plano."
Uh-huh.
"And, I know that, uh, the results that they get out of the system sometime is, is certainly not you know, up to what the effort they put into it, you know,"
"I've seen that for years,"
yeah.
"Right,"
"and, I know, uh,"
"I work around, you know a lot of teachers"
"and I I understand how, uh, supportive they are of their students and how excited they are,"
Uh-huh.
"but some how, I don't think the students are getting excited."
"Yeah,"
"I've often wondered if it doesn't come back to the, the home environment."
"Oh, yes"
"definitely,"
that's interesting.
"Yeah,"
"the only pet that I've had, uh,"
"I'm a, I'm a doctoral student right now"
Uh-huh.
"and in my, in my earlier days as a student I kind of time shared on a dog with a, a good friend of mine"
"and, uh, it was an amazing dog,"
it really was.
"They had, he had gotten it from the pound"
"and, uh, it, it's a Spanish Pointer named Domino. Kind of looks like a a Dalmatian"
"Oh, yeah."
Uh-huh.
"and we trained it from a pup,"
"and basically it, right now it, it's fully trained"
and it can do a lot of things.
"It will get beer for you out of the fridge,"
and it will get the newspaper and do all kinds of stuff.
"So, it's really, it's, it's kind of a show piece"
"and whenever anybody comes over, we all have to show him Domino you know ."
"Oh, I think so."
"Yeah,"
"it's, uh,"
"she's been a real good, a real good dog"
"and, uh, just, it's kind of a shame that I'm, I'm I'm away from it now."
"I, I I actually live in Florida"
Uh-huh
but I'm on an internship up here for a year
"and then I go back down,"
"but, uh,"
"yeah,"
Domino's a real good dog.
Yeah.
"Oh, that's fantastic."
"Yeah,"
"I used to, uh, kind of be that way myself when I lived in, uh, north western Florida in the panhandle,"
I used to sail about every day.
"I'd work, go to work,"
I'd like to do some sailing.
"Yeah,"
it's a lot of fun.
"It's, uh,"
"especially if you get a, a pretty fast boat"
like those catamarans are pretty fast.
"Yeah,"
"what,"
"You can actually,"
"Do, if you get one like that do have somebody teach you that"
"or they just,"
"Well, actually, I, I've known how to sail pretty much my whole life."
"Uh, my family's pretty into it"
Yeah.
"and, uh, I took sailing lessons when I was about six"
"and then, uh"
Is it pretty easy?
"Yeah,"
"it, it's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while, you know, uh, just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and, and the physics behind it."
Yeah.
"So it's, it's not too bad,"
"it's pretty easy to get the hang of, I think"
"and, uh, generally, everybody I've, I've known has kind of gotten into it,"
"but some people are more motorboaters, you know which is fine."
Yeah.
"Well, that's about all we have"
"Yeah,"
Yeah.
"Right,"
"they're kind of the leaders right now, you know."
"I used to see all those commercials for Windows, you know,"
"and you're like, oh, gee, they're reselling a MacIntosh under a different name."
"Really,"
"why don't they just say, almost a Mac for half the price."
"Yeah, you know."
They'd sell more if they were honest.
"Exactly,"
"almost is the key word, there, too, you know, because I, I really, I've used both"
and I really don't see an advantage of Windows at all.
"Yeah, it it's only an advantage for people who had to use pure D O S. base."
"Uh,"
"Yeah, yeah that's true, too."
"But, uh, I don't know,"
"I'm really, I've gotten a little bit out of the, the personal computer business just because I don't have one at home."
"I, I do use a Mac at work"
"but, uh uh, I really don't, don't do much with it at home"
Uh-huh.
"but, uh,"
Apple's sort of making a
and they're ones were
"growling consumer, uh, need to worry about the Mac they're getting,"
"like if you bought a power book straight off, a lot of them had to go back."
They issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with floppy drive.
Right.
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"you sound like you must, uh, work in the computer business."
"Yeah,"
"I have one,"
Uh-huh.
And we have the things that are extras.
But it seems that by and large the extras just don't exist.
Yeah.
"And, well, you know, the auto budget,"
car payment sucks a hell of a lot of it dry.
Uh-huh.
"And insurance,"
is insurance bad there?
"Um, I've got, uh, two older cars."
"There both,"
one's a seventy-seven
and one's a seventy-eight.
"Well, we've got one eighty-nine."
"And my insurance is about, it was running about four hundred dollars a year."
"But when I moved to the new town I live in,"
"because it's a different county, which has less crime, and, uh, less, you know, less highways"
"and so it's a cheaper place to live, as far as the insurance company's concerned,"
"so my, my, I think my insurance dropped about sixty dollars a year."
Wow.
"That's not bad,"
four hundred and something a year.
"That's, that's,"
It's actually three hundred and forty for each one of the cars.
That's cheaper than we pay.
"Yeah,"
"I was down in Texas for two years,"
"and I was paying unbelievable rates for both car insurance and for home insurance. Um,"
"Well, here in Colorado it's even worse because we have no fault."
Yeah.
Do you have that there?
they have no fault in Maryland also.
"I mean, you, you hate to be paranoid"
but there are really only so many things you can do.
"You can have the house alarm, uh neighborhood watch program, you know, uh, as a woman not go out at night"
Yeah.
Yeah.
"uh, you can do that which is what I choose to do."
Yeah.
One of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited
Yeah.
"even, even if you know that the threat is there it's against the law to set traps,"
Uh-huh.
"it's against the law to do a lot of things, you know."
"They could basically, uh,"
"when I was getting robbed down in Florida, I was really considering electrifying doors  um, things like that like"
Uh-huh.
"That's,"
Uh-huh.
they did in Miami that time.
"But it's not, uh,"
"if you kill someone in your home, as long as they are in your home, it's considered self-defense though."
That's not always true.
It isn't?
No.
"There was a, there was a case about two years ago where a guy knew he was going to get robbed"
Uh-huh.
"and essentially what he had done is set a, a a electrocution trap for the burglar in his own home."
Uh-huh.
Huh.
The guy came in while he was home
"and, sure enough, he fell into the trap and was severely burned."
"He didn't die,"
but he was severely burned
Uh-huh.
"and the average, you know, the average, uh, first frost is like the fifteenth of November here"
"Oh, if you had it early."
but usually it's not until later
It's really strange.
"Yeah,"
I think we usually have a frost in October.
Yeah.
"Uh, but, you know. We really need the rain that we've been getting,"
"and it has not today,"
"but the last few days it's been, been pouring most of the day."
"Is it, is it, is it flooding anywhere?"
Flooding anywhere.
"I have not heard of it, any problems of it flooding anywhere,"
"I mean, that's occurred certainly at times in the past,"
"but, uh, no,"
I've not heard of any particular problems this time.
"It's just kind of, uh,"
"we're supposed to have a chance to get some rain the next couple of days here, uh, which will be, you know, a little bit more typical, uh, autumn weather. But really it's strange."
We haven't really had an autumn.
It's like we went into winter
Yes.
"you know, the poor trees, said what"
"Yes,"
"yeah,"
we had summer lasting long
"and then it, then it, then it became winter like, uh today it's, today it's sort of change to warmer to sort of more typical autumn day."
"Yeah,"
"uh, it's,"
"Yeah,"
"there, you, you know,"
"usually there's, uh,"
Right
"and, and you'll find that that's the other big thing that has changed in terms of,  um, women don't feel like they need to get married anymore."
Uh-huh.
"Right,"
uh-huh.
I was twenty-seven when I got married
"and I just at the time, um,"
my husband actually even jokes about it.
Uh-huh.
He was twenty-three when we met
"an I was at a point where it was like, I didn't date,"
"I mean, I just, I went out to have a good time,"
Right.
but I didn't have to have male companionship.
"Right,"
right.
"Um, and a lot of the, um, friends that I had in school at that point, who had gone back and gone to law school, or M B A programs, um, which I also had done, had just, you know, they were very sad."
Uh-huh.
"But then by the time I got married, um,  it seemed like they were on their second or third around the marriage track."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"So, I guess that's a big change in terms of, just, um, the attachments that women feel like they need to have, the dependency,  their self-identity is stronger."
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"it's, it's just really not there anymore."
Yeah.
"And that, that has to do with, you know, the women getting out and other women seeing, uh, women seeing other women, you know,  out in the corporate world."
Right.
Uh-huh.
"That's like, oh, I can do that."
"You know, maybe,  I don't need to get married."
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"well, that, that was number one for the week actually, too,"
"so, so it was a little bit, uh,"
"I was thinking, Wow,"
people must be into crime movies again.
"But, but in the middle of that conversation we sort or picked an, um, an interesting point."
Last year's number one movie for the year was GHOSTS.
Is that right?
I don't know if you saw GHOSTS or not.
I did see GHOSTS.
"Yeah,"
"and, and, and that was, that, that helped us sort of feel good about, you know, about ourselves and about one around us, in that at least, at least, if everyone's running around seeing karate movies and stuff like that, at least they're still going to see the real good movies, you know."
Yeah.
I think that GHOSTS was one of those that a lot of people didn't think was going to be any good.
Yeah.
And it turned out to be an excellent movie.
Yeah.
"It was, it, I was absolutely enthralled by it."
"I've forgotten the guy's name who was in it, who had the lead role."
"Oh, Patrick Swayze?"
"Yeah,"
and I especially like him.
"Yeah,"
he's very good.
He's a really good guy.
"Other than that, DANCES WITH WOLVES seems like to be the only thing I've seen in the past several months to have any,"
"Really,"
I'm trying to think what else I've seen recently.
What else have we seen recently.
"Oh, you know, what's pretty cute actually. Um,"
DEFENDING YOUR LIFE.
"well, I think,"
"I also, course, like to catch the news during the evening hours"
Uh-huh.
"but, uh, it's a little tough because that's when I'm usually making dinner and the kids are wanting to talk all at the same time."
"So, usually I don't get a whole lot of news watching in."
"Yes,"
we watch C N N in morning while we're getting ready for the day and eating breakfast.
Uh-huh.
We'll catch our news that way.
Watch the weather channel so that we know what the weather's going to be like.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
So what have you seen interesting on OPRAH WINFREY lately?
"Lately, I haven't been catching it because of my work schedule."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I can't remember the last time I saw it."
It's been a while.
"Yeah,"
"well, I don't know if we've talked our full three minutes or not"
"I don't know,"
"sometimes they come on and, and say."
"Oh, that's right."
"Well, today on C N N they were talking about something like this about, uh, learning to recognize voices and words and stuff and the research that's going on which is kind of what we're doing, helping them get a data base for words."
"Um, yeah."
It was really interesting.
It is interesting.
"So,"
Do you work for Texas Instruments?
"No,"
"no,"
"just, uh, doing this as a fund-raiser for our church."
"Oh, that's nice."
"now grapes are the ones that you have to pull all that off,"
"but I get my kids to do that,"
"so,"
Oh
"I, I don't have to do that."
"And, um, and it really,"
and you mix it all up with
"there's a little dressing that goes in it that you have to stir up,"
but it's so simple
and it tastes really good because it's cool in the summertime.
"Oh, yeah."
You serve it cold?
Uh-huh.
"Oh, yeah,"
that sounds good.
"Yeah,"
"it has to sit in the fridge over night,"
"but, but it's really good."
Um.
And I like that one.
Yeah.
"Usually when we entertain we do something really simple, because I like to visit with my company, and not be scurrying around in the kitchen,"
Yeah.
"so, a lot of times, we'll barbecue"
Exactly.
"like, uh, for Memorial Day we had some friends over"
"and we just bought a brisket and marinated it overnight in one of those like Adolph's meat marinate, and put it on the smoker and cooked it."
Uh-huh.
"Oh, that sounds good."
And it was real good.
You can buy a fairly cheap piece of meat that way
and then people think they're eating steak or something
"Well, uh, normally I like to, to go out fishing in a boat, and, uh, rather than like bank fishing, and just like to try and catch anything that's swimming, because I've had such problems with trying to catch any type of fish, that, uh, I just really enjoy doing the boat type fishing."
"So, you like fresh water."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"I've never tried like with, deep, uh, sea water fishing because you get, I get sea sick"
Uh-huh.
Oh I see
"Well, one of these days, I'm hoping they'll have some kind of medicine,"
"so I can go out and go, uh, deep sea fishing."
"Now, that would be nice."
"Well, I was raised on the Texas gulf coast, in the summers,"
Uh-huh.
and during the Christmas holidays we'd go down to our house on the coast
Uh-huh.
"and so, I thought fish came out of the ocean"
"Oh, my goodness."
and anything that was fresh water was muddy
Uh-huh.
so I didn't learn to fish in a lake until I was well into my twenties
"so I had, I had always been a, a sea fisher type which is a lot of fun."
Uh-huh.
Oh I bet it is.
There's so many different ways to catch fish.
Uh-huh.
"You know, at night you can go walking in the shallows, and gig flounder and things like that."
"Which isn't technically fishing,"
but it's a lot of fun.
Uh-huh.
"So, I, I grew up fishing."
Uh-huh.
What area of lakes do you like?
"Well, uh, now, I haven't done much fishing here in Texas, uh, because I moved from Ohio,"
Okay.
"Um, well I guess first of all I, I could have asked that before."
Do you have children?
No.
No.
Okay.
"Because I, I didn't know if that would make a difference  in how you felt."
Yeah.
"Um, what do you think about the proposal that all young Americans should spend a year or two,"
I think it's a good idea.
"I think everybody should, should, uh, put in their time so to speak for the, for the good of the, the nation and for the good of themselves."
Yeah.
"I think it's, uh,"
"would everyone grow up and mature and, and realize what this country's all about."
"I just, um,"
"I guess that's my, that's something that my family has always believed strongly in,"
"and, uh, I had opportunities in high school, to work in some programs, um"
Did you?
something Oh!
"and, and I agree with what you said that it's, uh, it benefits the person doing it  so much I don't think they realize"
Uh-huh.
"and I, uh, I, I think it gives you a better perspective, on life"
"and, uh, it gives you a little bit, uh, more a glimpse of the, the real world"
"and  and it would certainly help the country, too, uh."
Yeah.
Really
"Yeah,"
"I think that's probably like, uh, quite a few things that, that the kids, uh, maybe not so much nowadays but used to  go through, you know,"
Yeah.
"they, just, they were, they did things for people, you know, for their communities, for their, their, uh, families, for their friends, where now, I'm not sure they really do."
Yes.
Yeah.
"Some of it kind of falls in the rap category I guess,"
so
"Um. The thing about country western that I don't enjoy is is, doesn't seem to be any imagination behind it"
Yeah.
"the, one country and western song sounds like every other, country and western"
"a lot of them, sound, uh, really similar,"
yeah.
"and so the, the musicians don't get to really get into their music."
They just play a certain number of chords
Yeah.
"the drummer plays a certain beat,"
and you have a country and western song
Um.
"and,"
"Well, that's kind of the way I feel about rock and roll sometimes, too, I guess."
"They don't really,"
"has kind of the same sound over and over,"
and the other thing I don't like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you can't understand what the lyrics are
Um. Right.
"you can't understand what they're saying on some of those songs which probably is just as well on some of them, too."
Yeah.
"And I can't say that I like a lot of the modern, the very, very modern, uh, rock and roll,"
Yeah.
"but I, I definitely, I really enjoy the fifties, the sixties and a lot, some of the seventies rock and roll"
Yeah
earlier things.
"and, uh, I really enjoy, especially the sixties ..."
Hello?
Hi.
"Hi,"
my name is Leslie.
"Hi,"
Uh-huh.
"And I think that is my biggest objection to anything as far as invading my privacy. If somebody wants personal information out of me,"
"but telephone calls I figure, they don't bother me one way or the other."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I know when I do telemarketing, um, I'm a soft person,"
"if, if someone says I am not interested I'll just say fine and back out."
Uh-huh.
"And I make very good sales,"
"but I'm not, uh, as I said, I'm not half as pushy as these people because, I don't really care."
"I mean, if, if they're not interested fine."
You know that's it.
You can't force them to be.
Right.
No.
"And I'm not pushing something down their throat that, uh, I don't think is a good item anyway."
Uh-huh.
That I don't think I could do anyway.
"But I feel like, oh, movie stars, or"
"sure, it's part of their, I guess they're portray being a movie star"
they get themselves in these rag sheets
"but, uh, I think they go too far."
"Oh, yeah"
I think that's invasion of privacy.
because they follow them around twenty-four hours a day.
Yeah
And you know they do Ted Kennedy.
"Oh, yeah."
"Of course, he's breaking the law all the time,"
so it's a different story then.
"You know, but, but Ed McMahon, I mean, you know, who cares about Ed McMahon."
"He's probably hasn't done anything interesting in the last thirty years that they've been on the air, you know."
And he has a chauffeur.
"And, and I'm,"
"I,"
"I'd,"
"I know it is, I know it is where I, where I work."
"But, I'm not sure that that's, that that's necessarily required. Uh, you know, by law that it has to be paid."
"Paid, right."
"Uh, I suspect that's a, that's a benefit of a bigger company."
"But, but there are certainly some, Some that, some that wouldn't, uh,"
Uh-huh.
Some that may decide not to.
"yeah,"
"Well, I don't know if there's going to be solutions to the U S budget."
"Well, now it's in pretty disastrous shape for sure."
Uh-huh.
It's only getting worse exponentially it seems.
Yes.
Exactly.
"Um,"
"There's, uh, maybe some short-term things that they can do"
"and it hurts everybody's pocket, of course,"
"but, um, I know that state has, uh, cutback, uh, raises for a year to help, uh, the, uh, state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better in a better condition."
Uh-huh.
"That,"
"Oh, which state is that?"
"Uh, State of Minnesota."
Uh-huh.
"So there's the potential that perhaps, you know, the U S budget might want to take a look at it's, uh, federal employees or, and take a look at saying, well, let's freeze wages."
"I mean everybody's doing it so it isn't like, uh, private business has had to do it"
Uh-huh.
so it might have to be something that they might consider doing as a that's got to be very short term.
Right.
Right.
"I don't, yeah, I, I don't think it can happen either."
Uh-huh.
"I just don't, I don't see,"
"and, then, I, I think, uh, hadn't thought about this before"
"but if you do that, if they would, uh, uh, decide to ban guns, it would just open up a, a market, you know, a black market for them."
"Yeah,"
"right,"
right.
"And so, you know, they, they would just,"
"all the profits would go to, you know,"
"Now I do believe though, like in California, if a little kid gets a hold of a gun that someone has I think they're liable now for,"
Yeah.
"they  can be, you know, put in jail and everything. The, whoever owned the gun."
"Oh,  Oh , yeah,"
the owner's responsibility?
"You know, now  when they have kids around, you'd think that they would be locking them up"
Yeah.
"or, you know."
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"you know, that's, that's true."
"Uh, you know, I, I had a friend who was a, uh, a policeman in a, in a local borough just a small, uh, one of the little neighborhoods, you know, one of the small towns, uh near Pittsburgh."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, she said that, that, uh, you know, he used to always keep his guns locked up and everything like that"
"but, I mean, you know, you're, you know,"
"people make, you know,"
"they forget or, you know, you know,"
"kids get in,"
"the way kids, the way kids are, you know, I mean, they can, you know."
Well they can get into almost anything anymore
Right.
"Okay Uh, let me see."
Bye.
Bye-bye.
"Okay,"
so do you all keep a budget?
"No,"
we don't.
You don't?
"No,"
"I, I make so much money here at T I that, that we just spend it."
And we never have a problem meeting it from paycheck to paycheck.
"It's pretty neat being that independently wealthy and working for a major semi-conductor firm,"
you can just spend it well.
"Are you being smart,"
or are you serious?
I'm being facetious.
I'm being very comical.
"Uh, we have a budget, um that works well."
Uh-huh.
"I kind of look at it for more of a,"
"we have a financial, uh, analyst, a finance administrator, I guess, that, that, uh,"
"I guess the financial planners, the training now."
We've had it for about four years here.
Uh-huh.
"Got our businesses and, and, and our life in line, how to manage credit cards, how to put away, say for, you know, money markets and this kind of thing."
Yeah.
"And, there's some freebies out there are"
you should put ten to fifteen percent of your monthly bring home in some sort of savings account.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"That being money market, uh, bonds, , savings, uh, or just a liquid account which, which we do."
Uh-huh.
"Um, you should always have three months of your salary in a savings account in case there's a major need for that."
The rest of them taking these vacations and using the taxpayers' money for that.
Right.
"And it's a real big crunch, uh"
Uh-huh.
"of course, when they get caught then they're, you know, they're guilty of course,"
"but, uh, during that time I'm sure there's hundreds of, uh, thousands of people that are, uh, spending money that does not belong to them."
"So,"
"Well, that's right."
"Uh, I think that, oh, politicians talk a lot about waste"
Uh-huh.
but I'm not sure that that's really that much of the problem.
Sure.
"I mean when you look at something like the Gulf War it cost us God knows how much. You know, at a million dollars, a pop for patriot missiles."
Uh-huh.
Exactly.
"And I don't think, uh, it's ended up being,"
I mean it gave people jobs
Yeah.
"but I think it also cost, um, quite a bit as far as because after they're done with the war, a lot of things were no longer put to use."
"I mean it was kind of like, okay, we'll do this during this point and time"
"but after that that's, you know, uh they didn't want to do it anymore."
Right.
Uh-huh.
"So, a lot of things that are saying that they're no longer going to be doing for next wars that are coming up that they did for this one in getting rid of a lot of things."
So I don't know.
Uh-huh.
Right.
"Okay,"
"well, it was good talking to you"
and have a good evening.
Okay
All right.
"Oh, for goodness sakes."
What do you do?
"Well, I work for the state as, as a grounds keeper."
"Uh-huh,"
"well, that's interesting."
"Um, so, at this time of the year are you doing much garden work?"
"No,"
"mostly snow removal, which we've had a lot of,"
"but, uh, I don't know,"
"I, I guess, uh, growing up on the farm and, and that, I, I've always had a big interest, uh."
Right.
"I have a, uh, when I have an area to do, I, I always had a big garden and enjoy working on lawns and, and everything."
Uh-huh.
"Well I love to work outside, really,"
and I enjoy flowers and stuff.
"I don't do a whole lot of it, um, at this exact point in my life, um, because I have two teenage boys,"
and so they do all the lawn all the lawn care
Okay.
"but I still take care of the, you know, flower beds and things like that."
"I was even planning to go out and to, uh, dig up some hibiscus plants that will not make it through the winter here, but, you know, were planted in the ground since last spring"
Uh-huh.
"and I was going to dig them up for a friend and for some starters for me,"
"and lo and behold, about five days ago, we had a freeze down to about, oh, twenty-three degrees or something"
Uh-huh.
so the hibiscus plants no longer exist
"Oh, that's terrible."
Twenty-three
"And I really feel bad about it,"
"it's a plant that we've had for probably twenty-five years that these were cuttings off of, you know."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"So, they're all gone at this point."
"With,"
"I don't know,"
cause I'm sure some of them have good reason to sue
"but I think a lot of them are just, you know, they're negligent"
and they get happy about money
and they just want to sue you.
Yeah.
"Well, yeah."
"That's,"
"yeah,"
exactly.
"When you have like a Kindercare or something set up and when they get greedy or whatever, that's when they have maybe one assistant to twenty kids or something"
Uh-huh.
"Oh, yeah."
"And that's just, you know,"
you can't watch that many little kids getting into things at one time
That's impossible.
"You know, you never know what they're going to get into."
I have a girlfriend that works at a daycare
and she takes her little girl with her
"and, I mean, she told me about half the people that they hire"
and half of them she'd like to turn them into the state
"And that's the people that are working there, you know."
"And then she would like to turn in half of the parents that drop their kids off because of the condition the kids are in, you know."
"Oh, that's horrible."
"Like they'll be in the same clothes they were the day before, the same diaper."
Huh.
"You know, just awful things."
And so I don't know.
I don't have kids
but I always think man I just don't know if I could trust anybody.
"I mean, you just don't know."
"Yeah,"
that would be a real good motivation for people.
"You know, because then it would, then it would make monetary sense to them, you know, to say, hey, you know, if I just spend the time to, to sort this out where this stuff can be recycled then I don't have to pay for them hauling it off."
Right.
"Yeah,"
"my father was telling me about some program he read about where you buy your bags, like you buy your garbage bag from the city,"
Uh-huh.
and you pay more than just what you would pay for an empty garbage bag
"but then you don't pay any monthly fee or anything,"
"so how ever many bags of garbage you throw away, that's how many you have to pay for."
"Oh, yeah"
that's about the same kind of thing.
Yeah.
Yeah
that would be a real good idea.
I'm trying to think if there's anything else I could think of.
"They are talking about going to curbside pickup in our, in our city ."
Where do you live?
"Rowlett, Texas."
"Oh, okay."
Do you know where that is?
Yes.
"And I don't know if they decided to do, or not,"
but I think they said it was going to add like either a dollar or three dollars a month to your bill to have them do that.
"Although, I think a lot of those programs can operate at about a break even, break even point,  without charging people."
It seems like they would be able to.
Yeah
"I don't know, uh,"
I guess it just depends on how they manage it.
Uh-huh.
I don't know how much they get when they sell all that stuff.
"The center that they've got now where you take your stuff in I, I think that should be making some money. Since they just have to hire someone to man it a few hours a week."

"Walter Karl Beisiegel OBE (13 July 1907 – 8 January 1973) was an English career Royal Air Force officer who played first-class cricket for the Royal Air Force cricket team and also for Leicestershire. He was born at Uppingham, Rutland and died in the RAF hospital at RAF Halton, Buckinghamshire."
"Beisiegel was educated at Uppingham School, where his batting at cricket won praise from Harry Altham in the annual review of schools cricket in ""Wisden Cricketers' Almanack"" in 1926. Altham wrote that Beisiegel ""stood head and shoulders over his colleagues"" and his innings of 126 not out for Uppingham against Rugby School ""was a fine wind-up to his school career""."
"For a period of five years between 1927 and 1932, inter-services cricket matches between the different branches of the UK armed forces – the Army, the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force – were rated as first-class. Beisiegel played in five of these matches for the RAF team between 1928 and 1931 as a middle-order batsman. In his first match, against The Army cricket team in 1928, he scored 54 in his only innings of the match, and this was to be the highest score of his first-class career. A year later, in the same fixture, he top-scored for the RAF with 53. Though Beisiegel continued to play in these inter-services matches through to 1938, none of his games were first-class after 1931, and these were the only first-class scores he made of more than 50."
"Three years after his last first-class game for the Royal Air Force team, Beisiegel played 10 matches for Leicestershire in the 1934 season as a middle-order batsman. He was not particularly successful, scoring 185 runs at an average of just 12.33 and with a highest score of only 33. But when the Leicestershire captain Arthur Hazlerigg was injured late in the season, it fell to Beisiegel as an amateur player to take over the captaincy, and in his first game as captain he led the team to its first victory over Yorkshire since 1911. ""The Times"" report said that it was ""the most sensational victory of the season"": Yorkshire had declared their first innings 102 ahead with only five wickets down but, set 149 to win, were all out for 90. Two weeks later there was a second victory under Beisiegel's leadership against a team considered greatly superior to Leicestershire when Nottinghamshire were beaten by an innings and 106 runs inside two days at Trent Bridge. The end of the season, however, marked the end of Beisiegel's first-class cricket career as he resumed his RAF duties; he was, however, awarded an honorary county cap in recognition of his captaincy successes."
"From school, Beisiegel went as a cadet to the Royal Air Force College Cranwell where he graduated as a pilot officer in December 1927. He was promoted from flying officer to flight lieutenant in 1933. This was followed by promotion from flight lieutenant to squadron leader in 1937. From the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 to May 1940, he was in charge of No. 616 Squadron RAF, a unit that was equipped with the Mark I Spitfire during his command and that was based at RAF Leconfield until deployed south in May 1940. In 1942, he was temporarily promoted from wing commander to group captain under the heading of ""General Duties"". He remained in the RAF after the Second World War and was then officially promoted from wing commander to group captain in 1947. In 1950, he was awarded the OBE in the King's Birthday Honours.

Interpretations varied as to whether the actual location – the Little Colorado River Gorge in Navajo territory outside Grand Canyon National Park's borders – was truly part of the Grand Canyon."
"The see became one of the dioceses approved by Cardinal Giovanni Paparoni at the synod of Kells in 1152, and has approximately the same boundaries as those of the ancient Kingdom of Breifne. In the Irish annals, the bishops were recorded of ""Breifne"", ""Breifni"", ""Breifny"", ""Tir-Briuin"", or ""Ui-Briuin-Breifne""."
"In the second half of the 12th century, it is likely the sees of Breifne and Kells were ruled together under one bishop. In 1172, Tuathal Ua Connachtaig took the oath of fealty to King Henry II of England as bishop of Kells. Soon after 1211 the see of Kells was incorporated into the diocese of Meath."
"In 1454, Pope Nicholas V gave permission for the then bishop, Aindrias Mac Brádaigh (Anglicised: Andrew McBrady), to have the ancient church at Kilmore, founded in the 6th century by Saint Felim (or Feithlimidh), to be the cathedral church of the diocese. This building passed into the hands of the Church of Ireland at the Reformation, and, following the construction of a new cathedral, is now used as a parochial hall."
"After the upheavals of the Reformation, there were parallel apostolic successions: one of the Church of Ireland and the other of the Roman Catholic Church."
"In the Church of Ireland, the title was intermittently held with Ardagh until they were finally united in 1839. In 1841, the sees of Kilmore and Ardagh were amalgamated with Elphin to form the united bishopric of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh. The current incumbent is The Right Reverend Samuel Ferran Glenfield M.A. M.Th. (Oxon.) M.Litt. He was elected, consecrated, and installed in 2013."
"In the Roman Catholic, the title continues as a separate bishopric. The most recent Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kilmore was the Most Reverend Philip Leo O'Reilly, who succeeded as the diocesan bishop on 16 October and installed at the Cathedral Church of Saints Patrick and Felim, Cavan on 15 November 1998. He had been appointed coadjutor bishop of Kilmore by the Holy See on 20 November 1996 and received episcopal ordination on 2 February 1997. He resigned on 31 December 2018 on health grounds."
"During the Reformation, Edmund Nugent and John MacBrady were at one time or another bishops of either the Church of Ireland or Roman Catholic succession. They were each appointed as Roman Catholic bishops, but later accepted or recognized as Anglican bishops."

One day while walking in the streets, Ana Paula's purse is snatched, and she unfortunately mistakes a witness by-stander, Fernando, to be the thief. Fernando is captivated by Ana Paula's beauty and charm, and he is instantly attracted to her. Fernando later discovers that Ana Paula is poor and must work hard in her father's boarding house in order to try to pay their debts.

= = = Nanto-Bordelaise Company = = =
"The Nanto-Bordelaise Company — formally ""La Compagnie de Bordeaux et de Nantes pour la Colonisation de l’Île du Sud de la Nouvelle Zélande et ses Dépendances"" — was a French company inaugurated in 1839 by a group of merchants from the cities of Nantes and Bordeaux, with the purpose of founding a French colony in the South Island of New Zealand."
"The company was formed after negotiations in August 1838 between whaling boat captain Jean-François Langlois and several Ngai Tahu Māori chiefs for the purchase of several thousand acres of land on Banks Peninsula, for which Langlois promised to pay a total of 1,000 francs. Upon returning to France in 1839, Langlois set about founding a company with the help of several financial backers, the eventual aim of which was to claim the entirety of the South Island for France. Government support was obtained in December of the same year via King Louis-Philippe to transport 80 settlers to Port Louis-Philippe (now Akaroa). A warship, the corvette ""Aube"", would travel to New Zealand, followed a month later by the colonists aboard . ""Aube"" left for the Pacific in February 1840, captained by Charles François Lavaud, who had been appointed as Commissaire du Roi."
"Aware of the potential threat of losing sovereignty of parts of the New Zealand island chain to the French, during early 1840, Lieutenant-Governor William Hobson was tasked with securing the whole of the country for the British Government. To this end, the Treaty of Waitangi was signed as an agreement between the British Crown and the indigenous Māori population. By the time ""Aube"" arrived at the Bay of Islands in June 1840, the acquisition of the country by Britain was effectively complete. Faced with no prospect of anything more than a small colonial settlement, Lavaud left for Banks Peninsula to oversee the arrival of ""Comte de Paris"". Hobson also sent a ship, HMS ""Britomart"", on board which were colonial magistrates."
"On arriving at Akaroa, Lavaud discovered that the agreement between Langlois and the local Māori was not as clear-cut as had been promised. Despite this, the founding of the colony went ahead, under an amalgam of French and British jurisdiction. C.B. Robinson, one of the magistrates sent on ""Britomart"", worked alongside Lavaud in the organisation of the settlement. Lavaud retired in 1843, and was succeeded as Commissaire du Roi by Post-Captain A. Bérard, who remained in this position until 1846, when formal agreements between the French government and the Nanto-Bordelaise Company settlement ended."
"The question of sovereignty remained a complex one, which the local colonial authorities were unable to solve. Eventually, the British Government resolved that the company would be awarded four acres of land for every £1 they could prove to have spent on the settlement. On 30 June 1849, the company's remaining New Zealand properties were bought by the New Zealand Company for the sum of £4,500. A second ship carrying more French settlers, ""Monarch"", arrived at Akaroa in 1850."
"Suleman had tapped into Sydney's Assyrian community, many of whom had remortgaged their homes."
"In April 2004, Suleman was jailed for 21 months, with a 12-month non-parole period, for four fraud offences."
"Two days shy of being released from a 21-month jail term in 2005 the corporate regulator struck again, laying 26 new charges."
Karl Suleman Enterprizes fleeced 2062 investors who committed $130.7 million between them – by inviting them to invest in a trolley collection business that promised investors returns of 100 per cent a year.
"But instead of their money going into that business, the money was used to fund Suleman's extravagant lifestyle."
"Suleman and his wife Vivienne bought properties, luxury cars, boats and planes, sponsored charity events and gave lavish gifts as well as dinners for former United States presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton."
Some of the money was used to service a $13 million loan taken out to finance a range of IT and mobile phone ventures under the Froggy Group banner.
"Documents filed with the court by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission showed that investors, mostly from Sydney's Assyrian community, were induced to put between $50,000 and $150,000 into the trolley business on the promise that they would receive fortnightly returns of between $4000 and $25,000."
"While investors received some fortnightly payments as promised, the money earned by the trolley collection business fell well short of being sufficient to sustain the promised payments."
"The company's liquidators said in their report that between July 2000 and November 2001 the business made a net profit of $275,096 but was paying out $2 million a week to investors seeking high returns."
"Suleman started the trolley business in 1993, providing trolley collections from supermarkets stretching from Cairns to Adelaide. Supermarkets paid Suleman an agreed fee out of which he paid subcontractors to do the work."
The District Court heard 15 people invested more than $3 million in Suleman's supermarket trolley collection business in 2000 and 2001.
"Thirteen of them lost a total of more than $800,000."
The founder of the Froggy Group – was sentenced to 7 and a half years jail after pleading guilty to 26 charges.
The judge found Suleman knew the income from his business was not enough to repay the investors.
"He said it was serious white collar crime, and that Suleman had breached the trust of naive investors so he could live a lifestyle far beyond his legitimate income."
"Two years after being released from jail on 20 June 2013, 52-year-old Suleman suffered a heart attack at his home in Horningsea Park Sydney."

"Both the original animated episodes, as well as the first seven live-action episodes, have been published to the official ""Potter Puppet Pals"" webpage."
"Much of the humor derived from the series originates from Cicierega's unique interpretation of the principal Harry Potter characters. Some characters are given personalities designed to contrast completely with their attitudes in the Harry Potter books. Cicierega's Harry is portrayed as an extremely brash, arrogant, and vain teenager who is ""rife with boyish attitude,"" while Dumbledore is a nudist. Other times, an aspect of the original stories is blown out of proportion for comedic effect, such as Hermione Granger's love of reading and matter-of-fact approach to problems.

Towards the end, Ron discovers that the source of the ticking is a pipe bomb that explodes as they celebrate, letting Lord Voldemort sing his name by himself to the tune of ""Lollipop"" by The Mudlarks. At the New York premiere of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2"", Alan Rickman was interviewed by MTV and quoted as saying “[Potter Puppet Pals] is very beautifully done, that little piece of work. Can you get rich from that? I hope they did."" Daniel Radcliffe also mentioned in an interview by MTV that the cast of the ""Harry Potter"" film series should do a live action version of ""The Mysterious Ticking Noise"" for a charity."
"On 23 March 2017, a 4K remake of the original video was posted to the Potter Puppet Pals channel to mark the 10th anniversary of the original."
"As of the first half of 2016, Winchester/Olin did manufactured and release for sale some WSSM ammunition. The product is only manufactured periodically, often on inconsistent intervals."
"The 243 WSSM is an addition to the Winchester Super Short Magnum (WSSM) family of cartridges, which also include the .223 WSSM and the .25 WSSM, and the idea behind the 243 WSSM was to develop a compact, higher velocity version of the well-established and internationally popular .243 Winchester unveiled by Winchester in 1955. The 243 WSSM was first introduced in 2003."
"The 243 WSSM's case is unusually short and fat in profile, contrasting markedly with most other rifle cartridges, and is intended to take advantage of what ballisticians have shown is the more uniform and efficient burning of propellant powder when it is held in a short, fat stack by the cartridge case."
"In their ballistics tables, Winchester list a very high muzzle velocity of with a projectile for this cartridge. Based on Hodgdon reloading data typical velocities should range from approximately with a bullet to approximately with a bullet. The percentage gain in performance over the older .243 Winchester is around 10% or less."
"This cartridge is usually used for small game such as varminting, and used for animals as large as deer."
Compared to other factory 6mm sporting cartridges the 243 WSSM is capable of functioning in the AR-15. Other factory produced 6mm cartridges like the 243 Win. and 6mm Rem. are both too long for the AR-15 and require the AR-10 platform.
"The 243 WSSM is 3/8 inch shorter than the 243 Win. giving the 243 WSSM the ability to fit in a super-short action rifle. Thus 243 WSSM rifles can be lighter, have stiffer actions and have faster actions to cycle."
The 243 WSSM gives generally a 10% increase in velocity over the 243 Win.

"Its vertex figure ""6.10/3.6/5.10/7"" is also ambiguous, having two clockwise and two counterclockwise faces around each vertex."
It shares its vertex arrangement with the truncated dodecahedron. It additionally shares its edge arrangement with the great icosicosidodecahedron (having the hexagonal faces in common) and the great ditrigonal dodecicosidodecahedron (having the decagrammic faces in common).
"There is some controversy on how to colour the faces of this polyhedron. Although the common way to fill in a polygon is to just colour its whole interior, this can result in some filled regions hanging as membranes over empty space. Hence, the ""neo filling"" is sometimes used instead as a more accurate filling. In the neo filling, orientable polyhedra are filled traditionally, but non-orientable polyhedra have their faces filled with the modulo-2 method (only odd-density regions are filled in)."

"Oteyboydak Tleukabyluly (1388–1478), was a Kazakh scientist, healer and author of solid medical-ethnographic works Shipagerlik Bayan. He was familiar with such historical personalities as Zhanibek khan, Zhirenshe sheshen. O. Tleukabyluly was a well-known public figure, involved in dealing with the plight of the people. The dates of his birth are taken from his book Shipagerlik Bayan. He writes that he started writing this book at the age of 70 at the request of Zhanibek khan and finished it at the age of 85; after Zhanibek khan’s death. There is also evidence that Oteyboydak died at the age of 90. He inherited his medical and healer gift from his ancestors. O.Tleukabyluly devoted his life to treatment and brought traditional (folk) medicine in the academic system. Thus, he was able to raise the medicine of his time at a high level. In this respect, he, like al-Farabi, despised thirst for fame, wealth, and devoted his life to the study of the peculiarities of healing. The book Shipagerlik Bayan has survived until today, thanks to his relatives. But only fourth part of the rich heritage, having gone through the test of time, has reached our days. The rest part was burnt by the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution in China. This book gives a lot of information on traditional Kazakh medicine. The fact that he used a variety of compounds (mixture), offered over 4000 recipes, convinces us that Oteyboydak was an experienced healer and an outstanding scientist. His book mentions medical properties of 728 kinds of drugs of plant origin, 318 kind of medicine of animal origin, 52 types of medicines derived from metals and metalloids, 8 kinds of rare and precious drugs, as well as references to some 500 anatomical terms. It witnesses that the book has the historical-ethnographic importance as well as the depth and richness of the Kazakh language. The book was published in 1994 in Kazakh Cyrillic script in Urumgi, In 1996 - in the Kazakh Cyrillic script in Almaty, Kazakhstan. In 1997 the book was awarded China’s National Book award. Two public medical centers for studying O.Tleukabyluly’s heritage were created in China. The monument to O.Tleukabyluly has been erected on Shalkode Zhailau in Almaty area and one street was named after him in Almaty. O.Tleukabyluly was not only a scientist-healer but also the visionary thinker, who well knew the life, customs, the world, the spiritual culture of his people."

= = = Emperor Duzong = = =
"Emperor Duzong of Song (2 May 1240 – 12 August 1274), personal name Zhao Qi, was the 15th emperor of the Song dynasty in China and the sixth emperor of the Southern Song dynasty. He was a nephew of his predecessor, Emperor Lizong, and reigned from 1264 until his death in 1274."
"His birth name was Zhao Mengqi but his name was changed to Zhao Zi in 1251 and finally to Zhao Qi in 1253 after he was designated as Emperor Lizong's heir apparent. Duzong's reign was filled with rebellions and warfare; the court was dominated by his chancellor Jia Sidao and Duzong himself gave in into drinking and women, thus abandoning his duties. He died in 1274 leaving behind three young boys, one of whom took the throne as Emperor Gong. He is the last Emperor of the Song to issue coins; subsequent Emperors were too busy fighting the Mongols to establish mints to cast any coins and did not have enough resources."
"Emperor Duzong's mother wanted to have an abortion because she thought she was of low social status so she took drugs in an futile attempt to abort Duzong. Duzong was born anyway but the drugs affected him in many ways such as that his intelligence was lower than an average person, his hand and feet were soft; using them in an awkward fashion and he couldn't even speak until he was seven years old. He was Yurui's only son. Like his uncle Zhao Yun, he lived in Shaoxing."
"Duzong was discovered by his paternal uncle Zhao Yun, better known as Emperor Lizong in 1253, who was sonless and therefore had no heirs so to compensate, adopted Duzong and designated him crown prince in 1260, an action historians still view as confusing. Emperor Lizong died in 1264 and Emperor Duzong then ascended the throne."
"Emperor Duzong's reign was plagued with rebellions, warfare and corruption in his court; many officials accused the chancellor Jia Sidao of corruption but Duzong trusted Jia Sidao who Duzong honoured by bowing down to Jia even calling him ""teacher"" and according to anecdotes, when Jia was considering resigning, Duzong knelt down in tears begging Jia to remain in office."
"Emperor Duzong ignored his duties and instead delegated all state and military affairs to the hands of Jia Sidao; the emperor instead indulged in drinking, women, and lived in opulence. To make things even worse, Duzong’s intelligence was lower than a normal person and he was often depressed. At first, he told the officials to be straightforward and tell him the problems in the countries, but this was all an act. Soon, he completely neglected his duties. Furthermore, he had a very high sexual appetite. Under Song laws, any woman who had sexual relations with the emperor had to pay respects to the emperor every morning. At one point, there were as many as 30 women paying their respects to Emperor Duzong in one morning. Duzong also gave official documents to four of his most favored women."
"The Mongols had spent decades harassing the Song Empire's borders and were on the verge of conquering the whole of China. Emperor Duzong however, ignored this problem instead choosing to drink and indulging in sex because when Duzong heard that Xiangyang was being besieged by Mongol troops, Duzong asked Jia Sidao ""I hear that Xiangyang had been besieged by the Yuan troops for several years. Is this true?"" in which Jia said in all seriousness ""Well, I haven't heard such a thing."" Duzong replied with ""A palace maid told me this."""
"Lu Wenhuan sent a messenger to Emperor Duzong, to request immediate reinforcements to defend Xiangyang. The messenger successfully got by the Yuan forts and reached the emperor but upon hearing the effectiveness of these new trebuchets, the emperor considered Xiangyang lost and did not send reinforcements. The decisive Battle of Xiangyang was fought in 1274 when the Mongols succeeded in capturing and destroying the last Song stronghold. The loss of Xiangyang sealed the fate of the Song dynasty and the news of its capture was deliberately hidden from Emperor Duzong by Jia Sidao."
"Emperor Duzong died shortly thereafter from overindulgence in wine but Richard Davis and other sources claim that, Duzong died suddenly from a severe negligence of a Palace Doctor. In any case, he was succeeded by his sixth son, Zhao Xian (Emperor Gong), who was then only four years old. Although Emperor Duzong was technically not the last emperor of the Song dynasty, historians see him as the last Song emperor who could have made decisions that would've significantly halted or even prevented the fall of the dynasty."
Emperor Duzong was buried in the Yongshao Mausoleum on January 1275.

To mark the 100th anniversary of roller coasters in the USA, Rolling Thunder's Coaster 2 side was renamed ""Rednuht Gnillor,"" the backwards spelling of ""Rolling Thunder,"" in 1984. The trains were turned around so riders would view the ride while riding backwards. During this season, Rednuht Gnillor's warning signs were placed in the back of the station and on the back of the lift hill so riders could see them."

The queue to the right of the entrance lead to the Coaster 1 track and Coaster 2 was reached by the queue on the left. Guests who were not tall enough for coasters with 54-inch (137 cm) minimum height would ride Rolling Thunder, which had a 44-inch (112 cm) height requirement."
"Unlike most racing coasters, Rolling Thunder's tracks were not always next to each other, they separated at several points in the ride. After the first drop, the left track traveled over a big hill, followed by a small hill, whereas the second track reversed that. On the turnaround at the back, the left track traveled up and made a level turn, while the right track traveled up and dropped while turning. The hills on the return segment were also staggered. The trains were not always raced."
"The structure and track was mostly built from 850,000 feet (259,080 m) of Douglas Fir. In the past, the Douglas Fir had been treated with pesticides which were not considered environmentally friendly and the track and supports were slowly being replaced with southern yellow pine."
"The track was made by bolting seven layers of wood. In most places on the ride, there were two layers of southern yellow pine, which sat atop five layers of Douglas-Fir. Older sections of track still had seven layers of Douglas-Fir (mostly on the lift) and there were refurbished sections of track with seven layers of southern pine. A strip of steel was bolted onto the top layer of wood track and three-inch-wide pieces of steel were bolted onto the sides."

"Obi-Wan Kenobi is joined by Jedi Master Adi Gallia and her Padawan Siri Tachi at Jenna Zan Arbor's secret laboratory on Simpla-12. Zan Arbor, who has been conducting experiments in an attempt to break the Force into its constituent parts, is holding captive Qui-Gon Jinn and the elderly Jedi Master Noor R'aya. The three rescuers attempt to smuggle themselves into the laboratory; however, despite the fact that Qui-Gon has managed to free himself, Zan Arbor escapes with the unconscious Noor."
"Later, Obi-Wan receives a message informing him that his companion Astri Oddo, who went to pursue the bounty hunter Ona Nobis, is injured on the planet of Sorrus. Qui-Gon and Adi send their Padawans to Sorrus to bring Astri home, but Obi-Wan learns that this was merely a trap set by Ona Nobis, and wisely chooses to run away from a fight. He and Siri are ordered to return to the Jedi Temple, but he convinces Siri that they should look for Astri since she's on Sorrus. They are transported to the far desert and investigate a cave where they find Astri and her three companions tied up. However, the cave collapses — another trap set by Ona Nobis. The party are eventually rescued by a member of a tribe that Astri once helped. The two Padawans learn that Ona Nobis is headed to Belasco, the homeworld of Senator Uta S'orn, Jenna Zan Arbor's only friend."

= = = Aero Spacelines Pregnant Guppy = = =
"The Aero Spacelines Pregnant Guppy was a large, wide-bodied cargo aircraft built in the United States and used for ferrying outsized cargo items, most notably NASA's components of the Apollo program. The Pregnant Guppy was the first of the Guppy line of aircraft produced by Aero Spacelines. The design inspired other later designs, such as the jet-powered Airbus Beluga and Boeing Dreamlifter."
"In 1960, U.S. airlines were disposing of their obsolete piston-engined Boeing 377 Stratocruisers in favor of the newer jet-engined airliners. NASA was finding that barge transport of their increasingly large space program components from manufacturers on the West Coast to test and launch sites on the East Coast was slow and expensive. Aircraft broker Leo Mansdorf was stockpiling surplus Stratocruisers at Van Nuys prior to resale, and ex-USAF pilot John M. Conroy realized the potential of these aircraft to transport the large but relatively light rocket components."
"Conroy presented his plans for an extensively modified Stratocruiser to NASA, where an official commented that the bloated aircraft resembled a pregnant guppy. Although NASA was lukewarm on the concept, Conroy mortgaged his house and founded Aero Spacelines International to build and operate the concept aircraft."
"Conversion work was undertaken by On Mark Engineering. The Pregnant Guppy (registered N1024V) was built from an ex-Pan Am airframe with a five-m section from an ex-British Overseas Airways Corporation aircraft (G-AKGJ) added immediately behind the wing. The wing, engines, tail, nose, and cockpit were unchanged, but a new upper fuselage of 6 m diameter was added, giving the aircraft a ""triple-bubble"" appearance in front view. The entire rear section (including tail surfaces) was detachable to allow cargo to be loaded directly into the fuselage."
"The aircraft first flew on September 19, 1962, piloted by Conroy and co-pilot Clay Lacy. When Van Nuys traffic control realized that Conroy intended to take off, they notified police and fire departments to be on alert. However, the huge aircraft performed flawlessly, the only difference in handling being a slight decrease in speed caused by extra drag of the larger fuselage."
"Carrying the S-IV Saturn I rocket stage, the Guppy saved three weeks' transit time versus barge, for a cost of $16.00 (equivalent to $ today) per mile ()."
"In the summer of 1963, the Pregnant Guppy began flying NASA cargo. Among its early duties was transporting the first and second stages of the Gemini program's Titan II from the Martin Co. in Baltimore, Maryland, to Cape Canaveral. As the space program grew through the late 1960s, this one aircraft clearly could not handle the whole transport load, so 25 more Stratocruisers and ex-USAF C-97s were purchased to construct four Super Guppy aircraft, which were even longer and larger than the original."
"The various Guppy aircraft served throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and beyond, initially transporting space components, and later, as NASA scaled down its operations after the success of the Apollo program, transporting airliner sections."

Jennifer Dunning, ""The New York Times"" dance critic, described his work as follows: ""Arthur Aviles has developed an individual voice and style that might be compared to bold street theater and poster art, communicating his truths about life as seen as a gay male Puerto Rican through simple narratives that are always colorful and often poignant and amusing."""
"Since 1991, Aviles has collaborated extensively with his first cousin, the comedian and performer Elizabeth Marrero. He has also collaborated with other gay Puerto Rican performers such as Jorge Merced. Avilés is publicly gay, as he has indicated in interviews, and many of his dance pieces explore gay topics."
= = = Sideritis = = =
"Sideritis (Gr: σιδηρίτις), also known as ironwort, mountain tea and shepherd's tea, is a genus of flowering plants well known for their use as herbal medicine, commonly as an herbal tea. They are abundant in Mediterranean regions, the Balkans, the Iberian Peninsula and Macaronesia, but can also be found in Central Europe and temperate Asia."
"In Greek ""sideritis"" can be literally translated as ""he who is made of iron"". The plant was known to ancient Greeks, specifically Pedanius Dioscorides and Theophrastus. Although Dioscorides describes three species, only one (probably ""S. scordioides"") is thought to belong to ""Sideritis"". In ancient times ""sideritis"" was a generic reference for plants capable of healing wounds caused by iron weapons during battles. However, others hold that the name stems from the shape of the sepal, which resembles the tip of a spear."
"In 2002, molecular phylogenetic research found ""Sideritis"" and five other genera to be embedded in ""Stachys"". Further studies will be needed before ""Stachys"", ""Sideritis"", and their closest relatives can be revised."
"Some schemes recognize and categorize up to 319 distinct species, subspecies, ecotypes, forms or cultivars, including:"
"Botanists have encountered difficulties in naming and classifying the varieties of ""Sideritis"" due to their subtle differences. One particularly confusing case is that of ""S. angustifolia"" Lagasca and ""S. tragoriganum"" Lagasca."
"The genus is composed of short (8–50 cm), xerophytic subshrubs or herbs, annual or perennial, that grow at high altitudes (usually over 1000 m) with little or no soil, often on the surface of rocks."
"It is pubescent, either villous or coated by a fine, woolly layer of microscopic intertwined hairs."
"""Sideritis"" inflorescence is verticillaster."
"Very popular in Greece, Turkey, Albania, Kosovo, Bulgaria and North Macedonia, ""Sideritis scardica"" is used as a herb either for the preparation of herbal teas, or for its aromatic properties in local cuisines. The herbal tea is commonly prepared by decoction, by boiling the stems, leaves and flowers in a pot of water, then often serving with honey and lemon."
"Ironwort has been traditionally used to aid digestion, strengthen the immune system and suppress common cold, the flu and other viruses, allergies and shortness of breath, sinus congestion, even pain and mild anxiety."
"Scientists have suggested that the popular pronouncement of ironwort as panacea may have some basis in fact. Studies indicate a positive effect on many common ailments. Ironwort is known scientifically to be anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant. Active elements include diterpenoid and flavonoids. Significant research has been done on ironwort confirming its popular use to prevent colds, flu, and allergies. Most of this research has taken place in universities in the Netherlands and in Greece, Turkey, North Macedonia, Bulgaria, and Albania, where the plant is indigenous."
"""Sideritis raeseri"" is the most commonly cultivated ""Sideritis"" in Bulgaria, Greece, Albania and North Macedonia, where advanced hybrids also exist. Planting is recommended during two periods (October–November or February–March in the Northern hemisphere) and gathering in July, when in full bloom. The plant is typically dried before usage."

"Hubert Max Lanier (August 18, 1915 – January 30, 2007) was an American left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who spent most of his career with the St. Louis Cardinals. He led the National League in earned run average in 1943, and was the winning pitcher of the clinching game in the 1944 World Series against the crosstown St. Louis Browns. His son Hal became a major league infielder and manager."
"Born in Denton, North Carolina, Lanier was one of a handful of players who remained active during the World War II years. A naturally right-handed player, he had become a left-handed pitcher only because he twice broke his right arm in childhood. After signing with the Cardinals in 1937, he reached the major leagues in 1938. He had arguably his best season in 1943, compiling a 15–7 record with a league-best 1.90 ERA. In 1944 he won a career-high 17 games, and was the winner of the final game of the World Series against the crosstown Browns. He was named an NL All-Star in both 1943 and 1944."
"Lanier, along with a dozen other major leaguers, defected to the Mexican League in 1946 after being offered a salary nearly double what he was making with the Cardinals. Disappointed by poor playing conditions and allegedly broken contract promises, he tried to return to the Cardinals in 1948, but was barred by an order from commissioner Happy Chandler, imposing a five-year suspension on all players who had jumped to the Mexican League. In response, Lanier and teammate Fred Martin, as well as Danny Gardella of the New York Giants, sued Major League Baseball in federal court, challenging baseball's reserve clause as a violation of U.S. antitrust law (preceding the similar suit by Curt Flood some 25 years later). Chandler reinstated Lanier and the other players in June 1949. Lanier immediately held out for more money than he was being paid at the time of his leaving for Mexico, but eventually signed a contract paying him the same amount as in 1946."
"Lanier rejoined the Cardinals in 1949. After winning a total of 101 games for the club, he ended his career with the New York Giants (1952–53) and the Browns (1953)."
"Over fourteen seasons, Lanier posted a 108–82 record with 821 strikeouts and a 3.01 ERA in 1619 innings pitched, including 21 shutouts and 91 complete games."
"Lanier died at age 91 in Dunnellon, Florida."

"Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio (1902–1964) was an Italian painter, the formulator of industrial painting, and a founding member of the Situationist International. He was also a scholar of popular culture, archaeology, nomadism, and botany."
"Pinot-Gallizio was born in Alba, Piedmont, where he became an independent Left councilman and a chemist. In 1955, he met Asger Jorn, with whom he co-founded the Experimental Laboratory of the Imaginist Bauhaus in Alba, which was part of the International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus, in opposition to the return to productivism by others in the Bauhaus school, in particular Max Bill. It was held in Pinot-Gallizio's studio, a monastery from the seventeenth century, and was attended by such artists as Enrico Baj who experimented with nuclear painting techniques, Walter Olmo, who experimented with musical interventions, Ettore Sottsass, Elena Verrone, and Piero Simondo."
"Pinot-Gallizio drew from his background as a chemist in developing new painting techniques. In 1956 he, along with Jorn, organized the First World Congress of Free Artists, at which a representative from the Lettrist International spoke, foreshadowing the foundation of the Situationist International in 1957 by members of both groups, including Pinot-Gallizio. At this conference the Italian artists withdrew from the Laboratory, and after the formation of the SI only Pinot-Gallizio and his son, Giors Melanotte, remained. He helped to make the SI known in the art world with an exhibition in Paris in 1959."
"He left the SI in 1960 as it became focused on political, rather than artistic, action. He died in Alba in 1964, and the laboratory continued its work until his death."
"Many of Pinot-Gallizio's works were industrial paintings. Rather than a small image to be interpreted, these huge canvases were intended to cover a large area. The first of these was the cavern of anti-matter, prepared in 1957 after the formation of the SI. It was composed of 145 meter canvases which were painted by hand or with the aid of spray guns and machines using resins invented by Pinot-Gallizio himself. It was displayed at the Galerie René Drouin in 1959, draped around the gallery and sold by the meter."

= = = Hop-tu-Naa = = =
"Hop-tu-Naa is a Celtic festival celebrated in the Isle of Man on 31 October. It is the celebration of the traditional Celtic festival of Samhain, the start of winter (). (The lenited form of the genitive singular of ""Samhain"" is ""Shamhna"".) It is thought to be the oldest unbroken tradition in the Isle of Man."
"Hop-tu-Naa is a continuation of the Manx ""Oie Houiney"", which is exactly the same as the Irish ""Oíche Shamhna"" and which was pronounced the same (though not in revived Manx). The exact status of Oíche Shamhna and its role in the Celtic calendar has been a matter of debate. Oíche Shamhna eventually mutated into Halloween in northern England and in Ireland, it was carried to America by Irish immigrants and developed into the modern Halloween."
"The term ""Hop-tu-naa"" comes from a Manx Gaelic song traditionally sung during the festival which included the nonsense Hop-tu-naa as a refrain; such nonsense rhymes are common theme in Irish and Scottish Gaelic music."
"On the Isle of Man today, many groups of people continue the tradition of singing Hop-tu-Naa songs ""around the houses"" (which traditionally referred to waits going around visiting houses, especially those of the wealthy, and soliciting gifts; beggars going ""around the houses"" are featured in The Deemster) with turnip lanterns. In addition to this, many public Hop-tu-Naa events take place across the Isle of Man each year, most of which today include competitions for artistically carving turnips and the singing of traditional songs. As well as the many events run within local communities, the National Folk Museum at Cregneash hosts an event to teach the traditional Hop-tu-Naa song and to help people to carve turnips."
"At the modern Hop-tu-Naa, children dress up and go from house to house hoping to be given sweets or money, as elsewhere. The children carry carved ""turnip"" lanterns (which are known as ""moots"" by the Manx) and sing Hop-tu-Naa songs. There are regional varieties of how turnips should be carved for Hop-tu-Naa, with variations focusing on which way up the turnip is and the nature of the decorations. It is believed that turnip-lanterns do not date earlier than the start of the 19th century, as the vegetable had only been introduced at the end of the previous century. In the past children would bring the stumps of turnips with them and batter the doors of those who refused to give them any money, in an ancient form of trick or treat. This practice appears to have died out."
"A hop-tu-naa dance was collected by both Mona Douglas and Leighton Stowell. It was believed to have been danced through the streets on Hop-tu-Naa night by couples carrying their turnip-lanterns. It is a simple procession dance for pairs of dancers which involves the Manx reel step and a combination of arches only. This dance is taught in many schools on the Isle of Man during October each year, and it is danced at many of the Hop-tu-Naa events across the island."
"Some of the older customs are similar to those now attached to the January New Year. It was a time for prophesying, weather prediction and fortune-telling. Last thing at night, the ashes of a fire were smoothed out on the hearth to receive the imprint of a foot. If, next morning, the track pointed towards the door, someone in the house would die, but if the footprint pointed inward, it indicated a birth."
Autocomplete allows quickly typing names in the context of the code. It can be further improved to assist the developer.
"For example, in an XML context, when the developer types an opening tag ""<"" he is offered a list of tags via autocomplete, contextualized following the DTD or XML schema of the document. As the developer types more letters, the offered choices are filtered to only retain the relevant completions. When the developer finally completes the tag, the editor automatically generates the closing tag."
"Other autocomplete techniques exist. For example, using the Eclipse IDE to code in Java, a developer can just type in the first letter if lowercase and the uppercase letters from a type/variable name then press Ctrl+space to be offered all the choices that match the entered letters that are valid for the current context (class name, interface name, variable or field names)."
Code snippets allow the developer to add a complex coding structure by typing a minimal amount of text. Code snippets can only be used in a valid context (statements snippets are only offered when you can insert statements).
"For example, using the Eclipse IDE to code in Java, a developer can type in ""instanceof"" then press Ctrl+space which will replace ""instanceof"" by the following code snippet:"
"This code snippet can be further customised by the developer, with the IDE placing the cursor:"
= = = First Leisure Corporation = = =
First Leisure Corporation plc was a leisure operator in the United Kingdom between the years 1981 and 2004.
"Originally based in Soho Square, London, and with other offices in Blackpool and Leicester, its operations included Blackpool Tower, the WinterGardens and all three of Blackpool's piers, as well as five other piers, health and fitness clubs, nightclubs and bars, tenpin bowling centres and other mainstream UK high street entertainment venues."
"In 2000 a management buyout (MBO) financed by 3i and PPM Holdings saw First Leisure shed all but its Nightclubs and Bars division, which retained the First Leisure brand and consisted of approximately fifty mainstream high street venues. The MBO saw the company de-listing from the stock exchange (whilst retaining its plc status) and moving its operations to Leicester."
"At that time, the Health and Fitness chain was spun off as Esporta."
"By 2004, the company had shrunk its operations from 50 to 25 nightclubs; in so doing, it had sold its premises leases to rival operators. A clause of such sales mandated that should those new operators be unable to meet their obligations under the leases that they would be automatically reassigned to First Leisure with little warning or ceremony."
"At the end of 2004, such an automatic reassignment took place following competitors' defaults on a number of previously sold leases. Unable to meet the dramatically increased month-to-month obligations brought about by this mandatory re-acquisition, the company was subject to a Winding Up Order by a trade creditor and hence placed into Compulsory Liquidation by the Official Receiver."
"A 'Phoenix' company, named The Nightclub Company, was formed virtually immediately by the incumbent management team. Such an operation was short-lived, however, and it too was placed into administration in 2005. The precise circumstances regarding the collapse of TNC are unclear."
"The remaining leases were sold, mostly to long-time rival Luminar Leisure."
All that remains of the corporation as of 2007 is the Esporta health and fitness chain.

"Anthonie Verstraelen or Van Stralen (Gorkum, 1593/1594 - Amsterdam, 1641) was a Dutch landscape painter, best known (with Hendrik Avercamp and his nephew Barend Avercamp) for his winter scenes."
"Gillis van Stralen, Antonie's father, was a textile merchant. The family originated in Weert but moved between 1584-1590 to Gorkum, presumably because of Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma's armies marching through the area."
"We don't hear much from Anthonie Verstraelen, until 1635 when he married Catalijntje van Oosten from Antwerp. The location of the wedding is unknown. The couple went to live in Oude Spiegelstraat, near Singel. In Amsterdam Antonie got into a dispute with the Sint Lucasgilde, for its laxness in allowing in too many non-citizen painters."
"In 1641 he was buried in the Westerkerk. In 1644 his two children inherited two hundred guilder each from the sale of their father's paintings. The paintings must have been sold very cheap. His widow remarried their guardian Emmanuel Jacobszoon van Hoogerheijm, an unknown Leiden 'fijnschilder'. Three months later their first son became born, Jacob van Hogerheijm, who also became a forgotten painter."

The Commission on Secondary Schools of the Middle States Association first granted the academy accreditation effective 2003–2010. In 2009–2010, the academy completed the review for re-accreditation and received the renewal of certification. Accreditation has been renewed until December 2017."
"St. Raymond Academy was established in 1960 by the Sisters of Charity, a congregation of religious women in the Catholic Church whose primary missions are education and nursing. For nearly 200 years, the Sisters of Charity of New York have served the needs of the poor.

"In April 2005, the New York City based Film Forum premiered an ""expanded"" version featuring several restored scenes, along with a new musical score by Christopher Caliendo. This expanded version was actually the 136-minute cut authorized by producer Jerry Bresler before he left Columbia Studios. Recently unearthed in Sony Pictures' archives, the restored version played in selected cities in North America and has been released on a Region 1 DVD. All of the cuts were edited out of the released version at the last minute; it is highly unlikely that Peckinpah's director's cut will ever be fully restored."
"Restored scenes are listed below. These include both brief inserts and additions to existing scenes, as well as four major scenes restored to the film."
"Available as extras on the DVD are an unfinished knife fight scene between Potts and Gomez in a Mexican village, a longer version of Teresa and Dundee's interlude at the lake, and several silent outtakes – including a master shot which would have opened the massacre scene at the beginning, of Lt. Brannin and his men riding past a sheep farmer to the Rostes Ranch."
"For the 2005 restored version, a new score was composed by Christopher Caliendo. This score was composed and recorded with a small studio orchestra to authentically sound the way director Peckinpah might have approved it had he been alive at the time of the film's restoration, and the way the music might have been done in its original 1965 release as opposed to today's larger orchestra-type scores. The new score is regarded by some critics as being better than the original, which was disliked by film experts and featured the title song performed by the Mitch Miller Sing-a-Long Gang, though many concede the new music is far from perfect; for example, there has been criticism of Caliendo's decision to leave unscored several sequences which did have music in the original version."
"Upon its theatrical release, ""Major Dundee"" received generally negative reviews while acknowledging the film's potential. In his review in ""The New York Times"", Eugene Archer wrote that the film had ""an interesting cast, a superior visual texture, unexpected bits of character revelation and a choppy continuity that finally negates its impact."" He praised Peckinpah for ""seeking a fresh approach to the Western"" and acknowledged that the director ""displays a fine eye for panoramic vistas."" Archer concludes:"
"Many of the flaws identified by film critics in 1965 were addressed in the 2005 restored version, and film reviews of the DVD are much more positive. In his review in ""Alt Film Guide"", Dan Schneider called ""Major Dundee"" ""a near-great film that has a checkered history"" and ""likely the most gritty and realistic Western ever made."""
"On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 97% positive rating from top film critics based on 32 reviews, and a 67% positive audience rating based on 3,478 ratings.

Organizers had hoped to haul all of the gear and supplies via bicycles to minimize energy consumption and maximize sustainability, but after some intensive research this proved infeasible, so trucks running on biodiesel or vegetable oil fuel were used. Research into solar cookers, composting toilets, determined how far the marchers were able to use sustainable methods to handle food and energy needs, and human waste. Participants and volunteers shared daily chores including but not limited to setting up camp, food preparation and clean-up. Interactive workshops focused on climate change, the anthropogenic effect on the environment, and active solutions."
"Throughout history, marches have been associated with political and social change. Examples include but are not limited to: the Woman Suffrage Parade of 1913, Gandhi's Salt March to defy Britain's imperial power, Martin Luther King Jr's Selma to Montgomery marches for voting rights and the Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament. Peace walks have been particularly popular in the peace movement."

= = = HMS Calypso (1783) = = =
"HMS ""Calypso"" was a Royal Navy Echo Class ship-sloop. She was built at Deptford between 1781 and 1783, launched on 27 September 1783 and first commissioned on 1 December 1783 for service off Northern Ireland and Scotland. She served in the North Sea, Atlantic, and the West Indies. ""Calypso"" was sunk whilst acting as a convoy escort on 30 July 1803 after colliding with a West Indiaman merchant ship during a violent storm."
"""Calypso"" was built to the same technical drawings as the five other ""Echo""-class ships: , , , , and . The class was designed to be 16-gun ship sloops with quarterdecks and forecastles."
"All use the same plans for frame, Inboard profile, Lines, Stern, and upper and lower decks"
"""Calypso"" was first commissioned in September 1783 under Commander Ralph Dundas for service on the Irish and Scottish stations. She was then refitted at Plymouth and placed in ordinary in October 1785. She was paid off in October 1786."
"Her second commission began in January 1787 under Commander William Mitchell. After fitting for Channel service she sailed for Jamaica on 16 April 1787, returning to home waters in 1790 and once more being placed in ordinary."
"""Calypso"" underwent a period of repair and was refitted at Portsmouth between July 1793 and March 1796. Her third commission began in January 1796 under Commander Andrew Smith, who took her to sea following her repair and refit to join Admiral Duncan's North Sea Fleet."
"In January 1797 Commander Richard Worsley took command and operated ""Calypso"" as a convoy escort and cruiser. Commander C. Collis succeeded Worsley in November 1797. Collis continued operating in this role until April 1798 when ""Calypso"" returned to Portsmouth for refit."
"Commander Henry Garrett took command in April 1799 and was succeeded by Commander Joseph Baker in November of that year. Baker took ""Calypso"" to the Caribbean, sailing for the Leeward Islands in February 1800. Whilst under Baker's command on this station, ""Calypso"" participated in several notable actions."
"In October 1801 Commander Robert Barrie assumed command, followed by Commander Edward Brenton in April 1802, and finally by Commander William Venour in August 1802."
"On 30 July 1803, ""Calypso"" and the 74-gun ""Goliath"" were escorting a convoy of heavily laden West Indiamen from Jamaica. The convoy was caught in a violent storm that dismasted 21 of the vessels. One of the merchantmen ran down ""Calypso"", sinking her with the loss of all hands."
"As an unrated sloop-of-war ""Calypso"" was too small a ship to warrant a Post-captain and was instead commanded by an officer in the rank of Commander, although aboard ship he was afforded the courtesy title of Captain. The commanders of HMS ""Calypso"" were:"
"From 1794 the Admiralty allowed a crew of 121 for a 16-gun sloop such as HMS ""Calypso"". The Commander and Lieutenants were professional sea officers, trained in gunnery, navigation and seamanship in equal measure and appointed to the ship by Admiralty Commission. The Lieutenants were all at least nineteen years of age, having served a minimum six-year apprenticeship as Midshipman or Master's Mate before undertaking and passing the examination for Lieutenant. The Commander would usually have been an experienced Lieutenant who had come to the attention of the Admiralty or his Commander-in-Chief through some distinction in service or by having an influential patron. The Commander's duties were almost identical to those of a Post Captain, although on a smaller scale, the exception being that as a Commander he had no automatic rights of promotion to the flag list and could quite easily remain a Commander for the rest of his career."
"The Warrant Officers were specialists appointed to the ship by Navy Board Warrant. The Wardroom Warrant Officers were allowed all the privileges of a Commissioned Officer, eating and sleeping with the Lieutenants. The Standing Warrant Officers stayed with the ship throughout its commission and remained aboard when the ship was placed in ordinary. They were heavily involved with the fitting out of the ship and general maintenance. Cockpit Officers had a higher status than the Petty Officers and could generally expect to reach the Wardroom in time, with its members aspiring to be Lieutenants, Masters, Pursers or Surgeons. Petty Officers performed particular roles that required additional skills or expertise, and they were usually rated by the Captain or First Lieutenant on joining the ship. Unlike the Warrant Officers, the Petty Officers had no security in his rank; the Captain could demote a Petty Officer for negligence. A Petty Officer could also lose his rating on moving to a new ship."
= = = Operation Christmas Drop = = =
"Operation Christmas Drop is a tradition that started in 1952 that serves as a training mission for the U.S. Air Force. It has since become the longest-running U.S. Department of Defense mission in full operation, and the longest-running humanitarian airlift in the world. Supported by the local communities of Guam, it is primarily conducted from Andersen Air Force Base and Yokota Air Base, and targets Micronesia."
"The operation was first conducted in 1951. Then, the aircrew of a WB-29 aircraft assigned to the 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, formerly assigned to Andersen Air Force Base in Guam, was flying a mission to the south of Guam over the Micronesian atoll of Kapingamarangi. When they saw the islanders waving to them, the crew quickly gathered some items they had on the plane, placed them in a container with a parachute attached and dropped the cargo as they circled again."
"A witness to the first drop on the island of Agrigan said ""We saw these things come out of the back of the airplane and I was yelling: 'There are toys coming down'"". At the time the island had no electricity or running water, and the islands were periodically hit by typhoons. Some of the first containers failed to arrive where intended, and islanders swam out to retrieve some, while others were discovered months later some miles away."
"Today this unique Christmas tradition is continued with the donations from the residents and businesses of Guam. Each box dropped from a C-130 aircraft weighs nearly and contains items such as fishing nets, construction materials, powdered milk, canned goods, rice, coolers, clothing, shoes, toys and school supplies."
"It is the oldest ongoing Department of Defense mission which remains in full operation, and the longest running humanitarian airlift in the world. By 2006, more than of supplies were delivered. The operation gives troops the chance to practice humanitarian aid drops, as the troops will later be expected to conduct drops over Iraq or Afghanistan after deployment."
"Volunteers from Andersen Air Force Base, including 734th Air Mobility Squadron, and both crew and aircraft from the 36th Airlift Squadron at Yokota Air Base, Japan, participate in the operation. Members of the Guam community also help the operation. Money is raised for the operation by sponsored activities such as golf tournaments and sponsored runs, as well as local businesses sponsoring individual boxes."
The 2006 operation saw 140 boxes dropped to 59 islands. The 2011 operation included dropping twenty five boxes of IV fluids to Fais Island in order to combat a local outbreak of dengue fever. The containers are dropped in water just off the beaches in order to avoid them hitting any of the locals.
"In 2014, The Pacific Air Forces delivered 50,000 pounds of supplies to 56 Micronesian Islands."
"In 2015, the Japan Air Self-Defense Force and the Royal Australian Air Force participated in the operation along with the United States Air Force. Japan and Australia each provided one C-130 Hercules to join the three C-130's provided by the United States. The JASDF and RAAF also participated in the 2016 and 2017 operations."
"December of 2017 marked the inaugural training event for the new C-130J from Yokota AB as well as the first quad-lateral event with the JASDF, RAAF and Philippine Air Force."
= = = John McCabe (composer) = = =
"John McCabe, (21 April 1939 – 13 February 2015) was a British composer and pianist. He created works in many different forms, including symphonies, ballets, and solo works for the piano. He served as principal of the London College of Music from 1983 to 1990. Guy Rickards described him as ""one of Britain's finest composers in the past half-century"" and ""a pianist of formidable gifts and wide-ranging sympathies"" ."
"McCabe was born in Huyton, Liverpool on 21 April 1939 (; ; ; ; ). His father was a physicist . McCabe was badly burned in an accident when he was a child and was home schooled for eight years . During this time, McCabe said that there was ""a lot of music in the house"", which inspired his future career . He explained ""My mother was a very good amateur violinist and there were records and printed music everywhere. I thought that if all these guys – Beethoven, Brahms, Schubert – can do it, then so can I!"" . By the age of 11 McCabe had composed 13 symphonies, but he later suppressed them, believing they were not good enough (; ). He subsequently attended Liverpool Institute ."
"After studies at the Royal Manchester College of Music (now the Royal Northern) and in Munich, with composers Humphrey Proctor-Gregg, Thomas Pitfield, Harald Genzmer and others (; ; ), he embarked upon a career as both a composer and a virtuoso pianist (; ). Guy Rickards considers McCabe's early works to have been overlooked because he was perceived as a pianist rather than a composer . One of his early successes was the orchestral song cycle ""Notturni ed Alba"" (1970), based on a set of poems in medieval Latin about the theme of night (; ), which was described in ""Gramophone"" as ""an intoxicating creation, full of tingling atmosphere and slumbering passion"" (quoted in }}). His Concerto for Orchestra (1982) brought him international recognition , but it was not until the 1990s that he came to be viewed primarily as a composer, with the successes of the piano work ""Tenebrae"" (1992–93), which marked the deaths in 1992 of musicians Sir Charles Groves, William Mathias and Stephen Oliver, and was written for Barry Douglas; his Fourth Symphony, ""Of Time and the River"" (1993–94); and his third ballet ""Edward II"" (1995) , which won the 1998 Barclays Theatre Award ."
"He worked in almost every genre, though large-scale forms lie at the heart of his catalogue with seven symphonies, two dozen concertante works and eight ballet scores to his name . His numerous concerti include four for his own instrument, the piano (1966–76), three for one or two violins (1959, 1980, 2003) as well as for viola (1962), harpsichord (1968), oboe d'amore (1972), clarinet (1977), orchestra (1982), trumpet (1987) and flute (1990), and double concertos for viola and cello (1965) and clarinet and oboe (1988). His chamber works include seven string quartets, the third of which (1979) was inspired by the landscape of the Lake District . His solo instrumental music was mainly written for the piano; he composed 13 studies for the instrument, including ""Gaudí"" (1970), inspired by the architect; ""Mosaic"" (1980), inspired by Islamic art; and a series of seven (2000–9) each explicitly drawing inspiration from a different composer (; }. Other significant piano works include the ""Haydn Variations"" (1983), written to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Haydn's birth (; ; )."
"McCabe's style evolved gradually from an initial lyrical constructivism through a serialist phase, with a fascination with repetitive patterns leading to a more complex combination of processes to achieve more subtle forms of continuity . Rickards states that his influences included Vaughan Williams, Britten, Tippett and Karl Amadeus Hartmann , and he was also influenced by non-classical music including rock and jazz ."
He had a long-lasting association with the Presteigne Festival .
"McCabe first became known as a pianist. His repertoire was wide, from pre-classical to modern composers . He specialised in twentieth-century music, particularly by English composers. He gave the UK premiere of John Corigliano's Piano Concerto . Another specialism was the music of Haydn; McCabe's ""definitive"" mid-1970s recording of Haydn's complete piano sonatas was described in ""Gramophone"" as ""one of the great recorded monuments of the keyboard repertoire"" (quoted in ). He recorded several CDs with the cellist Julian Lloyd Webber ."
"From 1965 to 1968 McCabe was pianist‐in‐residence at University College, Cardiff . He served as principal of the London College of Music from 1983 to 1990, where his efforts to enhance the college's profile resulted in its merging with Thames Valley University (; . He also held visiting professorships at the universities of Melbourne, Australia and Cincinnati, USA during the 1990s . Among his notable pupils is Canadian composer Gary Kulesha ."
"McCabe wrote guides to the music of Haydn, Bartók and Rachmaninoff, and a book on contemporary English composer Alan Rawsthorne ."
McCabe was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1985 for his services to music (; ; ) He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Liverpool .
"In 2014, McCabe won the Classical Music Award at the 59th Ivor Novello Awards ."
"He married Monica Smith, a former head of the Sittingbourne Music Society, in 1974 (; ). In December 2012 McCabe was diagnosed with a brain tumour. He continued to compose music during his treatment (; )."
John McCabe died after a long illness on 13 February 2015 .

It is occasionally referred to simply as Baranof. Baranof Warm Springs is located at ."
"Baranof Warm Springs is located on Warm Springs Bay which is just off of Chatham Strait. Just about a half mile up from the settlement is Baranof Lake, a large glacially-fed freshwater lake. Baranof Lake is fed from small unnamed glacial run-off streams as well as the relatively large Baranof River. Between the half mile outlet between Baranof Lake and Warm Springs Bay there are a series of rapids and waterfalls that have proven to be lethal when run."
"Baranof Warm Springs is located on the southern part of a , exposure of a biotite-quartz diorite batholith that crosses northern Baranof Island."
"Baranof Warm Springs is a very small community, having only caretakers in the winter and intermittent visitors in the summer. There are around 15 seasonal homes. The community lies inside the jurisdiction of the City and Borough of Sitka. Other than property taxes and any dock fees from the new dock (2016) there is only one tax-paying commercial enterprise, the Baranof Wilderness Lodge and Resort. The city, in return, funds maintenance of a boardwalk which serves as the main thoroughfare as well as the dock for transient vessels. The community of property owners (BPOA- Baranof Property Owners Association) pools money together to pay for a seasonal (winter) caretaker for seasonally-inhabited residences, the city-owned picnic shelter (possible shelter for those needing it), the public bath house (which features three separate tubs), and the communal warm springs pools. Another caretaker is hired to tend to the Baranof Lodge from October 1 to May 1 when the owners of the Lodge return."
"Baranof Warm Springs was used frequently by the Tlingit of Angoon. People of western descent did not find the springs until 1891. It was serviced by a post office from 1907 through 1912, under the name of Baranoff."
"Baranof Warm Springs appeared on the U.S. Census twice as an unincorporated village. First in 1930 as Baranof with 25 residents and as ""Baronof"" in 1940 with 10 residents. It was later annexed into the City and Borough of Sitka."
"Baranof Warm Springs is accessible via floatplane with regularly scheduled flights leaving Sitka. The trans-island flight is 30 minutes on a clear day and an hour on an overcast one. The Alaska Marine Highway does not service Baranof Warm Springs and there is no scheduled ferry/marine passenger services to the community. Baranof Warm Springs itself does not feature any roads, and the boardwalk does not accommodate ATVs."
The primary attraction is the warm springs. There are a total of nine separate hot springs with temperatures from lukewarm to 120 degrees F. Only one is developed in a natural state and is located right up against the white water of the Baranof River. The community built a public bathhouse at the waterfront to provide an option for visitors not wanting to bathe communally and/or make the 1/4 mile hike up the trail to the natural springs.
"Small tour boats come in frequently in the summer, but also fishermen, and employees of the Hidden Falls Hatchery visit as well. The warm springs is also the terminus (or occasionally the trailhead) of the Baranof Cross-Island Trail. On the northern end of Baranof Lake there is also a Forest Service cabin that is quite popular. The cabin can only be reached by boat or float plane. The terrain is too steep to hike."

"In addition to the original variant, Just Born also markets ""Hot Tamales Fire"" (originally ""Super Hot Hot Tamales"") with a hotter flavor and darker color."
"In 2011, Just Born released ""Hot Tamales 3 ALARM"" containing a mix of three candies: orange (hot), pinkish (hotter) and dark red (hottest). In 2014, Just Born released ""Hot Tamales Tropical Heat"" that contains three candies, combining the original pungent, spicy flavor with lemon, mango and pineapple flavor."
"A spearmint version, Hot Tamales Ice, was marketed in the late 2000s, but was subsequently discontinued. It was reintroduced again in 2018 combined with the regular Hot Tamales and marketed as Hot Tamales Fire & Ice."
As listed on the original Hot Tamales box and Hot Tamales Fire boxes:
"Sugar, corn syrup, modified food starch, contains less than 0.5% of the following ingredients: dextrin, medium chain triglycerides, fruit juice from concentrate (pear, orange, strawberry, cherry, lime, lemon) sodium citrate, pectin, citric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, confectioners glaze, carnauba wax, white mineral oil, artificial flavors, artificial color, sodium citrate, magnesium hydroxide, red #3, red #40, yellow #5 (tartrazine), yellow #6, blue #1."

= = = Salomée Halpir = = =
"Regina Salomée Halpir (1718 – after 1763) was an 18th-century oculist. She often earns the title of the first female doctor from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. What is known about her life is known from her memoirs, written in 1760, which is a unique example of travel memoir and women's literature. Halpir expressed decidedly un-womanly characteristics and ambitions. Instead of dedicating her life to raising children and being a good wife, as dictated by the 18th-century social norms, Halpir strove to become a successful medical doctor and expressed her hunger for travel and adventure."
"She is known under a great variety of names. Her first name is often given as Salomea, Salome, or Salomėja. In her memoir, she referred to herself as Salomea, but she signed the dedication as Regina. Her maiden name is rendered as Rusiecki, Rusiecka, Ruseckaitė, Rusieckich. Halpir or Halpirowa is her married name from the first marriage. Her name from the second marriage is rendered as Pilstein, Pilsztyn, Pilsztynowa, Pilštyniova, or Pichelstein. Even after bitter divorce from her second husband she continued to use his last name, perhaps because it sounded more noble. In the dedication of her memoir she used the fourth surname – Makowska. It has been suggested that it is the surname of her third husband, but the origin of that surname remains unknown."
"Halpir was born near Navahrudak, Grand Duchy of Lithuania, to the family of Joachim Rusiecki of petty nobility. At the age of 14 she was married off to a German Lutheran oculist Dr. Jacob Halpir. The couple moved to Constantinople, Ottoman Empire, where Dr. Halpir practiced medicine and had many clients while facing cut-throat competition from Jewish and Muslim doctors. Despite, or perhaps because of, her being a poorly educated Christian woman in an Islamic country, Halpir was trained by her husband and assisted him in his operations eventually becoming an accomplished physician herself, with a specialty in cataract surgery. Her status as a female helped her find a niche serving female patients and her status as a foreigner helped her skirt Islamic traditions that severely limited women's freedom. Halpir never received any formal training in medicine."
"Later, her husband fell ill. He died leaving Halpir with their 2-year-old daughter, Constance. After this, Halpir embarked on an extensive journey throughout Europe. During the Austro-Russian–Turkish War (1735–39), she bought four Austrian prisoners of war. Three of them were ransomed by relatives while the fourth, ensign Pilstein, became her second husband. She traveled to Poland where Michał Kazimierz ""Rybeńko"" Radziwiłł made her husband an officer and offered her the position of doctor's residence in Nesvizh. Harpin traveled to Saint Petersburg to free some Turkish prisoners of war. There she gained access to the imperial court and met Empress Anna of Russia and future Empress Elizabeth of Russia. After several months she returned to Poland. She divorced her second husband, whom she bore two sons, after she accused him of adultery, attempting to poison her, and extortion. She moved to Vienna where Prince József Rákóczi fell in love with her, but she declined his marriage proposal. Halpir became romantically involved with a Polish nobleman, seven years her junior, who took advantage of her wealth. She also accused him of starving one of her sons to death. She returned to Constantinople and became a physician of the women in the harem of sultan Mustafa III. Until recently, her destiny after 1760, when she completed her memoir, was unknown. Dariusz Kołodziejczyk has found that in 1763 she was employed as a physician in the Khan’s harem in Bakhchysarai and as such she served as an informant of the Russian consul Aleksandr Nikiforov."
"Halpir's 388-page autobiography was discovered by a Polish historian Glatman in the library of Prince Czartoryski. The memoir was published as ""Proceder podróży i życia mego awantur"" (My Life's Travels and Adventures) in Poland in 1957. A number of the events in the memoir seem far-fetched and implausible. For example, she described how her leg became limp and visibly shorter due to a magic omen. Therefore, biographical accuracy of her memoir is disputed and some researchers prefer to treat it more as a work of fiction than factual autobiography."

An Intent is a messaging object which provides a facility for performing late runtime binding between the code in different applications in the Android development environment. Its most significant use is in the launching of activities, where it can be thought of as the glue between activities: Intents provide an inter-application messaging system that encourages collaboration and component reuse."
"An Intent is basically a passive data structure holding an abstract description of an action to be performed. ""For Dummies"" likens an Intent to flicking a switch: ""Your intent is to turn on the light, and to do so, you perform the action of flipping the switch to the On position."""
"The concept was created as a way to allow developers to easily remix different apps and allow each type of task (called ""activity"") to be handled by the application best suited to it, even if provided by a third party. Although the concept was not new, the Android architecture doesn't require elevated privileges to access the components, which makes it an open platform."
"Activities in Android are defined as classes that control the life cycle of a task in the user interface. The activities supported by an application are declared in a manifest, so that other applications can read what activities are supported. Intents in one application can start particular activities in a different application, if the latter supports the message type of the Intent."

"The two popular models claiming to explain the WSE are the interactive activation model (IAM) and the dual-route coding model (DRC) Neither of these models takes attention into account; This is a relationship looked into through research on the WSE. Evidence shows that the WSE persists without an observer’s conscious awareness of the word presented, which implies that attention is neither necessary for WSE nor involved in this phenomenon. However, attentional focus has been demonstrated to modulate the WSE which agrees with recent neurophysiological data explaining that attention, in fact, modulates early stages of word processing."
"The activation-verification model (AVM) is another model that was developed to account for reaction time data from lexical decision and naming tasks. The basic operations explored in the AVM that are involved in word and letter recognition are encoding, verification, and decision. Both the IAM and the AVM share many basic assumptions such as the fact that stimulus input activates spatially-specific letter units, that activated letter units, modulate the activity of word units, and that letter and word recognition are frequently affected by top-down processes (e.g. Reading the phrase ""A cow says..."" a person would guess ""moo"" and in checking that the word begins with 'm' ignores the rest of the letters)."
"The WSE has proven to be an important finding for word recognition models, and specifically is supported by Rumelhart and McClelland's interactive-activation model of word recognition. According to this model, when a reader is presented with a word, each letter in parallel will either stimulate or inhibit different feature detectors (e.g. a curved shape for ""C"", horizontal and vertical bars for ""H"", etc.). Those feature detectors will then stimulate or inhibit different letter detectors, which will finally stimulate or inhibit different word detectors. Each activated connection would carry a different weight, and thus the word ""WORK"" in the example would be activated more than any other word (and therefore recognized by a reader)."
"According to this interactive-activation model, the WSE is explained as such: When the target letter is presented within a word, the feature detectors, letter detectors and word detectors will all be activated, adding weight to the final recognition of the stimulus. However, when only the letter is presented, only the letter detector level will be activated. Therefore, we may remember the presented stimulus word more clearly, and thereby be more accurate in identifying its component letters, as observed in the WSE."
"The AVM deals with encoding, verification, and decision operations. Encoding is used to describe the early operations that lead to the unconscious activation of learned units in memory. After encoding, verification occurs. Verification often leads to the conscious recognition of a single lexical entry from the respondents. Verification is to be viewed as an independent, top-down analysis of stimulus that is guided by the stored, or previously learned, representation of a word. Real-time processing in verification can be mimicked by a computer simulation. Lastly, the factors affecting speed and accuracy of performance in a particular paradigm depend on whether decisions are based primarily on information from encoding or verification."
"One of the findings of the Johnston and McClelland reportwas that the WSE does not occur inevitably whenever we compare a word and a nonword.

"Rex Hughes (September 24, 1938 – May 9, 2016) was an American college and professional basketball coach. He coached men's basketball at Long Beach City College, Kent State University, and later served as a National Basketball Association (NBA) assistant coach. He served as head coach for part of a season with the Sacramento Kings, and a single game as an interim coach with the San Antonio Spurs. Hughes also worked in NBA scouting and basketball operations with the Kings, Atlanta Hawks and Orlando Magic."
"In 1968-1969, Hughes was Head Coach at Long Beach City College, his first collegiate job after coaching in high school. His squad finished 23-5. When Hughes left to be an assistant at Nebraska, he was replaced by Lute Olson, in his first collegiate job."
"Replacing Frank Truitt at Kent State University in 1974, Hughes' teams went 6-20, 12-14 and 8-19 over the next three seasons. The team started 1-10 in 1977-1978 when he was replaced by Mike Boyd."
"In 1978-1979, Hughes was Head Coach and General Manager of the Montana Sky (Great Falls, Montana) in the short-lived Western Basketball Association. The Sky were co-owned by country singer Charlie Pride. Notably, Hughes had Cazzie Russell and Brad Davis on the roster. Hughes was hired by the Sky mid-season when Coach Bill Klukas was fired after a 3-17 start. The league folded after one season."
In 1991-1992 Hughes served as an Assistant Coach under Dick Motta with the Sacramento Kings and went 22-35 in 57 games replacing Motta as Head Coach after Motta was fired.
"In 1992-1993, Hughes was hired to serve as an Assistant Coach to Jerry Tarkanian with the San Antonio Spurs. However, just 20 games into the season at 9-11, Tarkanian was fired. Hughes was 1-0 as interim Head Coach before John Lucas (39-22) was hired."
"On March 4, 2009, Hughes became the 15th person in ""The Rex Streak"", a streak by radio talk show host Jim Rome of consecutive days interviewing someone named Rex."
"Hughes died on May 9, 2016 at the age of 77."
= = = FSV Salmrohr = = =
"FSV Salmrohr is a German association football club in the village of Salmrohr, Rhineland-Palatinate. Founded in 1921, the small club has limited resources and has relied largely on local talent, but still managed two decades of play in the tier III Amateur Oberliga Südwest and Regionalliga West/Südwest and earned a national amateur title in 1990."
"In 1925, they became part of the Deutschen Jugendkraft, a Catholic-sponsored national league, playing as ""DJK Salmrohr/Dörbach"". The modern-day side was formed following World War II in 1946 as ""SV Salmrohr"". It was renamed ""Fussball Club Salmrohr 1946"" the following year and took on the name ""Fußballsportverein Salmrohr/Dörbach"" in 1957."
"Toward the end of the war, Rupe resolved to get into the entertainment industry. After losing money he had invested in a small record company, he spent $200 on what were called ""race records"" at the time to systematically analyze them and determine the formula for records that would sell. He decided that the secret lay in a big band sound with a churchy feel. He found the recording talent he needed in the many after-hours clubs in the Watts district. He and Ben Siegert first started Juke Box Records in 1944 and after a few hits, he broke with his partners and started a new company, Specialty Records. The label soon thrived with Roy Milton, Percy Mayfield, and Jimmy Liggins, along with a very successful gospel catalog. The major producers for the label were Rupe, Robert ""Bumps"" Blackwell, and J. W. Alexander. Johnny Vincent was a sales representative for the company."
"Rupe had a love of gospel music, and in 1947 he began recording gospel quartets such as the Soul Stirrers, the Swan Silvertones, the Pilgrim Travelers, Alex Bradford, Dorothy Love Coates and Sister Wynona Carr. His taste for gospel carried over into secular music and influenced his choice of artists to record, such as Guitar Slim, Don and Dewey, Lloyd Price, Larry Williams, and Little Richard. It led him to value feeling over technique in the recording studio. Concerns about religious objections to the secularization of gospel music, combined with a contract dispute, resulted in his decision not to put out a pop record with gospel singer Sam Cooke. He recorded but ultimately chose not to release two songs that later became big hits, ""You Send Me"" and ""Summertime""."
"In 1952, Rupe first traveled to New Orleans because of his attraction to the gospel sound of Fats Domino who played piano in the band of Dave Bartholomew, a former trumpeter with Duke Ellington. It was on this trip that he auditioned and then recorded Lloyd Price."
"Rupe obtained his most successful artist when Little Richard, then a little-known recording artist, followed Lloyd Price's suggestion and sent Rupe a demo record. Art sent Blackwell to New Orleans to do a recording session. During a recording break Little Richard sang an obscene song while playing the piano. Blackwell sensed that it was a hit, but after the lyrics had been cleaned up, there was no time to teach the song to a piano player. So Little Richard both played and sang the only song to emerge from that first session, done in just three takes, ""Tutti Frutti"", one of the most significant rock and roll records ever made. Rupe also recorded Guitar Slim, with a young Ray Charles on piano. In addition, Specialty issued some of wildest R&B records, such as ""Cherokee Dance"", by Froggy Landers; ""(Everytime I Hear) That Mellow Saxophone"", by Roy Montrell; ""Drunk"" by Jimmy Liggins; and the rock & roll ""Moose on the Loose"", by Roddy Jackson."
"When asked why Specialty was so successful, Rupe credited his own ability to produce rather than his business skills. In the early 1960s, he stopped producing records but remained active in the music business as a publisher. He returned during the fifties revival period in the late 1960s but only to reissue landmark recordings of the R&B era. Rupe sold Specialty to Fantasy Records in 1991. However, it is worth noting that the contracts that were given to the artists to sign left Rupe and others at the label with full ownership and publishing rights of the music. Richard signed a contract with Specialty Records in 1955. He reportedly gave the label full ownership of all the music he recorded with them in return for 50% of the royalties earned. In his authorized biography, he states that he sold his publishing rights to “Tutti Frutti” for $50, leaving him with a small half-cent royalty rate per record sold. In 1959, Little Richard left the label and filed a lawsuit claiming he never received his royalties. He settled for $11,000 and waived his rights to royalties from such hits as “Tutti Frutti” and “Long Tall Sally”."
"During the 1960s and later, Rupe became increasingly involved in oil and gas investments. Success in this area allowed him to establish the Arthur N. Rupe Foundation, a philanthropy based in Santa Barbara."
He turned 100 in September 2017.
"In 2007, Rupe was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame."
"On December 15, 2010, it was announced that Rupe will be awarded the Ahmet Ertegun Award (along with former Elektra Records founder Jac Holzman) by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
"= = = Texar's Revenge, or, North Against South = = ="
"Texar's Revenge, or, North Against South () is the full title of the English translation of the novel written by the French science-fiction author Jules Verne, and centers on the story of James Burbank, an antislavery northerner living near Jacksonville, Florida, and Texar, a pro-slavery southerner who holds a vendetta against Burbank. Originally published in France in 1887, the book received a tepid reaction upon its release in the United States, partly because of Verne's inexpertise regarding some details of the American Civil War, and has since fallen into obscurity compared to many of Verne's other works."
"Texar and Burbank are bitter enemies, Burbank's northern view of slavery as an evil being an unpopular stance with Texar and the rest of the community, deep in the Confederate States of America. On top of this disagreement, though, Texar is angry at Burbank for past legal troubles Burbank has brought upon Texar, and, despite Texar inventing a perfect alibi that allows him to escape conviction, Texar feels the need for vengeance and eventually becomes a prominent and powerful member of the Jacksonville community. Using this newfound power, Texar turns the townsfolk against Burbank and leads a mob that destroys the Burbank plantation, known as Camdless Bay. Burbank's daughter Dy and caretaker Zermah are both kidnapped by a man claiming to be Texar and are purportedly taken to a place in the Everglades called Carneral Island. En route, and after enlisting the help of the United States Navy, they find a separate group searching for Texar in response to crimes that apparently happened in the same time as the ones at Camdless Bay but in a distant location. This opens up the realization that there is one real Texar and one who is not, and the search continues now, not only for Dy and Zermah, but for the answer to this mystery."
"""Nord Contre Sud"", the original French title of the book, was first published in its fully illustrated edition in November, 1887, by J. Hetzel et Cie, Paris."
"In the first American (and first English) translation, ""Nord Contre Sud"" (North Against South) was relegated to a subtitle and the book's title was made ""Texar's Vengeance"", quickly re-translated as ""Texar's Revenge"". This edition was published by George Munro, New York (1887), a translation by Laura E. Kendall as part of the ""Seaside Library"". Since then, however, there have been more minor variations on the title, some editions referring to the title as ""The Texar's Revenge"", others omitting the title completely in favor of the more simple ""North Against South"". The most common and generally most accepted American version of the title is the full ""Texar's Revenge, or, North Against South"". There have also been a handful of editions that have split the book into two volumes, those being ""Burbank the Northerner"" and ""Texar the Southerner"", both of which are contained in most editions of the book. Various cheap editions were published in the U.S. for the next 20 years by W. L. Allison, Hurst, and others."
"The first fully illustrated edition in English was ""North against South"" published by Sampson Low, Marston, Searle, and Rivington, London, December 1887. This is a different anonymous translation from the one published by George Munro. In 2007 the first fully illustrated edition of ""North against South"" in the U.S. was published by the Choptank Press of St. Michaels, Maryland as a Lulu Press book, a replica re-publication of the Sampson Low first edition."

"Too-Rye-Ay is the second album by Dexys Midnight Runners, released in July 1982. The album is best known for the hit single ""Come On Eileen"", which included the lyrics ""too-rye-ay"" that inspired the album's title."
"Shortly before recording this album, Dexys' bandleader Kevin Rowland had decided to add a violin section to the band's existing horn section, which had contributed strings (viola and cello) to the band's previous single, ""Liars A to E"". However, after violinists Helen O'Hara and Steve Brennan joined the band, the three members of the horn section, including Dexys' co-leader and album co-composer ""Big"" Jim Paterson, decided to leave Dexys and become an independent horn band (ultimately known as The TKO Horns). Rowland convinced them to stay with the band long enough to record the album and to perform in a kick-off concert debuting the album on BBC Radio One in June 1982."
"All the songs on the album were rearranged to add strings, which caused Dexys to re-record the 1981 singles ""Plan B"", ""Liars A to E"", and ""Soon"". During the rearrangement process, ""Soon"" was revised into the opening section of ""Plan B""; since both songs were written by Rowland and Paterson, the merged songs are credited on the album simply as ""Plan B""."
"The album's ""Come On Eileen"" became a number one hit in both the UK and the US. Dexys Midnight Runners is best known as a one hit wonder in the US (""Come On Eileen"" was also the first US single release by Dexys), but in the UK, ""Geno"" had previously reached number one, and ""Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)"" and ""The Celtic Soul Brothers"" were also UK hits."
"Before ""Come On Eileen"", Dexys' only North American single was the Northern Soul classic ""Seven Days Too Long"", which Dexys' previous label EMI America had released only in Canada (with ""Geno"" as the B-side). However, on the strength of ""Come On Eileen"", ""Too-Rye-Ay"" reached number 14 in the US. Dexys' success in US was not maintained; the best performer of the band's follow-up singles in the US was ""The Celtic Soul Runners"", which peaked at number 86."
"Different releases of ""Too-Rye-Ay"" featured different versions of ""Come On Eileen"". Certain editions of the album featured a version beginning with a solo fiddle playing the first line of the folk song ""Believe Me, if All Those Endearing Young Charms"" and ending with a simple fadeout (""length: 4:07""). This version of the song is the one featured on the single release. Other editions of the album (including many of the ""re-releases"") featured a version without the violin intro and including a tag of Kevin Rowland singing ""Young Charms"" at the end, while the digital version offered by Spotify includes both front and end ""Young Charms"" tags (""length: approximately 4:32""). In addition, the most common release of the album features ""Come On Eileen"" as the final track, while the original US release features the tune as the opening track on Side 2."
"The album was re-released in 1996 on CD with 8 bonus tracks. In 2000 an enhanced edition was released with the music videos for ""Come On Eileen"" and ""Jackie Wilson Said"" as bonus material. In 2002 a US edition with bonus tracks was released. Marking its 25th Anniversary, a 2007 2-CD Deluxe Edition was released, which included the entire 14-song album kickoff performance on BBC Radio 1 that had previously been released (without ""I'll Show You"") as ""BBC Radio One Live in Concert""."

"Westside High School is the only high school of the Westside Community Schools district (also known as District 66 to local residents) of Omaha, Nebraska, United States."
"Westside has used a modular schedule since 1967. Each module, or ""mod"" (as known colloquially among WHS students), is either a 20 or 40-minute period used for classes or independent study time in an instructional materials center (IMC). This allows freedom in scheduling as classes can be 40, 60, or 80 minutes long, as needed for one-to-one, small group, large group, and laboratory instruction. Classes are taught in a similar format to many universities; students meet a large group lecture once per week and have small group recitations throughout the week. An average student has at least one or two full open mods per day, to be used for studying, interacting with teachers, eating lunch, or socializing. Juniors and seniors who have met specific requirements are eligible to apply for a pass that allows them to leave the building during open mods."
"In 1985, Westside Senior Bridget Mergens was denied the ability to create an after-school Christian Bible club. The principal at the time rejected the idea since he said a religious club violated the First Amendment's Establishment Clause. In addition, the club lacked a school sponsor that was required when forming a club. Mergens argued that the district's decision was in violation of the federal Equal Access Act requiring that groups seeking to express messages containing “religious, political, philosophical, or other content” not be denied the ability to form clubs. In 1990,Westside Community Board of Education v. Mergens was heard by the Supreme Court. In an 8-1 decision, the court said that since the club did not study school curriculum, it was permitted under the Equal Access Act."

= = = International Offshore Rule = = =
The International Offshore Rule (IOR) was a measurement rule for racing sailboats. The IOR evolved from the Cruising Club of America (CCA) rule for racer/cruisers and the Royal Ocean Racing Club (RORC) rule.
"The IOR was superseded (in the early 1990s) by the International Measurement System (IMS) and CHS (since renamed IRC). While some IOR yachts race at club level under IRC in more or less their original form, others had major surgery to make them competitive within the new rules."
"The IOR concentrated on hull shape with length, beam, freeboard and girth measurements, foretriangle, mast and boom measurements, and stability with an inclination test. Additionally, the IOR identified features which were dangerous, or it couldn't fairly rate, and penalized or prohibited them. The measurements and penalties were used to compute the handicap number, called an ""IOR rating"", in feet. The higher the rating, the faster the boat was deemed to be able to sail. A typical IOR 40 footer (a ""one tonner"") rated 30.55 feet."
"The IOR rule encouraged wide short boats with limited stability. A narrow waterline and large beam on deck, combined with a high centre of gravity, meant that crew weight provided a significant proportion of stability at small heel angles, and boats had a relatively low angle of vanishing stability. This developed into the situation about 1977 when the boats winning in most smaller IOR categories (up to the half tonners - about 10m LOA) had all internal ballast, often with an unballasted daggerboard. The managers of the rule realised that this was not a suitable direction for seaworthy yachts, and heavily penalised boats with lifting keels, but not before the 1979 Fastnet race ended in disaster. Writes John Rousmaniere:"
"Apart from the girth measurements, all measurements were basically point measurements. This meant that the hull was often locally distorted to maximise or minimise a measurement locally, with minimal effect to the surrounding hull. This gave a characteristic ""bumped"" look to many boats, particularly at the point of maximum beam and in the stern. Also, as stability was only measured at very low heel angles (less than 5 degrees), boats were designed with a very narrow waterline and low stability in measurement trim, but a hull form that gained stability with the weight of the crew and other equipment, and with increasing angles of heel. Low stability was encouraged (up to a point) because the initial assumption was that low stability indicated a well fitted out interior, and so more of a cruising boat than a stripped out racer."
"Rolling Thunder used skid brakes to stop the trains rather than modern fin brakes. The trains had brake pads underneath each car which slid against the brakes to lift the train's wheels off the track. The brakes were always in the up position unless the operator, in conjunction with the rear unloader attendant, advanced a train. The road wheels were heard spinning at the end of the ride and continued to spin until the operator, in conjunction with the unload attendant, advanced the train."
"There were three sets of brakes. The trim and ready brakes were located in the tunnel at the end of the ride. The trim brake slowed and stopped the train and served as a holding place for one train until the second train left the station. The train was advanced off the trim and onto the ready brake. The ready brake held the train until the second train reached the top half of the lift hill. The Dispatch brake held the train in the station while it was being unloaded and loaded for the next ride. The trains were stopped manually and were not always aligned with the queue stalls in the station. Therefore, the attendants had to direct the guests to their rows from time to time before the airgates were opened."
"When the brake pads and wheels got wet, there was little friction to stop the trains and they slid too far onto the brakes. For safety reasons, only one train ran per side in rainy weather."
"There were four trains that were distinguishable by color: Red, Blue, Yellow and Green. Each train had four three-bench Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters cars held together by hitch bars. Each car contained six seats. Each train held a maximum of 24 riders."
The trains used buzz bars that locked in one position. Seat dividers and headrests were added in 1981 to prevent people from standing on the ride while it was in operation. Seat belts were added on the ride's 30th anniversary.
There were three types of wheels used on the trains. Sixteen road wheels rode on the steel layer on top of the track. Sixteen guide wheels guided the trains around the turned on a separate steel track located on the sides of the wooden track. Sixteen upstop wheels rode on the bottom of the track.
"On August 16, 1981, a 20-year-old park employee from Middletown, NJ fell from the coaster to his death during a routine test run. An investigation by the New Jersey Labor Department concluded that the man may not have secured himself with the safety bar. A park representative later confirmed this conclusion, saying that the employee ""may have assumed an unauthorized riding position that did not make use of safety restraints."" The ride was inspected, and the Labor Department concluded that the ride was ""operationally and mechanically sound."""

"The nurturant parent model also ""Nurturing Parent"" is a metaphor, for a belief system, which is built upon an underlying value system. In this Nurturant Parenting contrasts with Stern Father parenting (Strict Father) as two distinct metaphors each used as icons of contrasting value and political systems, i.e. Regressive (Strict Father) and Nurturing Parent as Progressive ."
"The Nurturant Parent metaphor draws on parenting style. The ideal, effective Nurturing Parent gives his children both ""roots in the ground and wings to fly."" He or she does this by imparting, conveying, role-modeling and enforcing boundaries which encourage the child towards personal freedom (try out your new wings). The Nurturant Parent model has a healthy respect for children's inherent intelligence. As safe and appropriate, they can and should be allowed to explore their environment. Parents are responsible for protecting their child from serious mistakes, by offering guidance. A child will be picked up if the child cries because the parent wants the child to feel safe and supported. If a child grows up believing its needs are likely to be met, it will be more confident when facing challenges."
"At the same time or alternately as appropriate, the Nurturant Parent encourages the child to have deep and peaceful roots in the ground through managed exercise of the child's own self-discipline, self-connection, age-appropriate house chores, limited allowance, discussion of both Feelings and Thoughts and mutually healthy boundaries with strangers, friends and adults generally."
"The above was originally expressed more simply as 'a family model where children are expected to explore their surroundings; at the same time, being protected by their parents.'"

"This model is based on a study conducted by the Boston College Graduate Program in Human Development where researchers were investigating the parenting style preferred by parents of extraordinarily creative children. Most parenting books recommend the authoritative style. The researchers discovered another parenting style which they called ""the nurturing parent"" that focuses on responsibility, empathy, and creativity. The basic approach these parents used was to:"
"Herbert Jay Rosenfield (LCSW) in his unfinished book ""Caring Parents: a Guide to Successful Parenting"" encourages use of the acronym ""RECEPEE"", for ""Reasonable Expectations, Clearly Expressed, Performed Everyday and by Example"". ""The factors that children need to develop good self-esteem...are primarily 'gifts' from us parents!"" writes Rosenfield, who offers another acronym ""UCARE"":"
"Reverend George Englehardt stated succinctly, in 1991, that ""parental responsibility is to provide their children with a safe, loving, nurturing environment""."
"The nurturant parent model is also discussed by George Lakoff in his books, including ""Moral Politics"" and ""Whose Freedom?"" In these books, the nurturant parent model is contrasted with the strict father model. Lakoff argues that if the metaphor of nation as family and government as parent is used, then progressive politics correspond to the nurturant parent model. For example, progressives want the government to make sure that the citizens are protected and assisted to achieve their potential. This might take the form of tough environmental regulations or healthcare assistance."
"The model is also consistent with slow parenting in that children are encouraged to explore the world for themselves. They have to learn to face the risks that nature presents. Although slow parenting might go further and reduce the level of protection offered by parents, it would not advocate withholding it entirely."

"In geometry, the truncated great dodecahedron is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron, indexed as U. It is given a Schläfli symbol t{5,5/2}."
"It shares its vertex arrangement with three other uniform polyhedra: the nonconvex great rhombicosidodecahedron, the great dodecicosidodecahedron, and the great rhombidodecahedron; and with the uniform compounds of 6 or 12 pentagonal prisms."
This polyhedron is the truncation of the great dodecahedron:

"Niall Matter ( ; born October 20, 1980) is a Canadian-American actor."
"Following recovery from a serious accident sustained while working on an oil rig, Matter chose to pursue a full-time acting career. He received his first significant break in 2007, with a main role in teen drama ""The Best Years"". Later in the same year, he joined the cast of ""Eureka"" as bad-boy genius Zane Donovan. In 2009 he had a small supporting role in Zack Snyder's film ""Watchmen"". He went on to star as Evan Cross in the short-lived 2012 series """". His career subsequently moved away from science fiction, seeing him star in several television movies, as well as joining Canadian series such as ""Remedy"", ""Arctic Air"" and ""When Calls the Heart""."
"Born in Edmonton, Alberta, of Irish and Russian descent, Matter grew up on his parents' dairy farm. He is a third-generation oil rigger, having worked on the oil rigs in Northern Alberta for eight years. On the recommendation of a school teacher, he enrolled in drama classes at age thirteen, going on to win the Best Actor prize at a provincial drama championship in 1999. However, after getting himself in trouble at age 17, his parents sent him for a three-month stint on the oil rigs to work with his grandfather. He has acknowledged that it was this experience that helped him to focus on his studies and pass his high school exams. He continued to work on the oil rigs alongside his grandfather and brother Trevor until the age of 25, while simultaneously moving to Vancouver and attending Vancouver Film School in pursuit of his long-term goal of an acting career."
"At the age of 25 Matter had a serious accident while working on the oil rigs, where he was nearly crushed inside the cab of a 17-ton drilling rig. His quad muscle had been detached from his femur, and he nearly lost his right leg. It took six months for him to be fully rehabilitated, having to go through extensive physio therapy to fully regain his ability to walk. On returning to the oil rigs, he witnessed another accident in which a man lost both his legs. This convinced him that it was time to move on, so he quit, returning to Vancouver, where he lied his way into a bar tending job before landing his first acting role."
"Matter landed his first professional acting job in 2007 playing the lead role of baitshop owner Josh Riley in the Syfy original film ""Loch Ness Terror"", (broadcast as ""Beyond Loch Ness""), which also starred Brian Krause and Don S Davis. While filming ""Loch Ness"" he sent an audition tape to the producers of ""The Best Years"" which lead to him gaining the main cast role of bar tender, and cocaine addict, Trent Hamilton in the series first season. He went on to play the role of USAF airman Lieutenant Kemp in a two-episode guest spot on the Syfy television series ""Stargate Atlantis""."
"He subsequently auditioned for the Syfy series ""Eureka"". for what he understood was a one-episode guest star role. By his own admission, Matter took risks in the audition, playing the character as more flirtatious than he was written. The risks paid off, and he was cast in the role of bad boy genius Zane Donovan, first appearing in the season two episode ""E=MC...?"". The character would go on to develop a romantic relationship with the town's Deputy Sheriff Jo Lupo played by Erica Cerra. His role was recurring throughout seasons two and three. Season four saw a soft reboot of the show - following a time traveling incident, the characters return to an alternate timeline, with character dynamics and relationships shifting. This led to Matter's role as Zane being expanded as he became part of the main cast, which continued through to the show's fifth and final season."
"During this time, he also had guest roles on ""Warehouse 13"", portraying one half of a married couple alongside ""Eureka"" castmate Cerra and on NBC's ""Fear Itself"", playing a lovelorn zombie. In 2009/2010, Matter appeared as a recurring guest star on The CW shows ""Melrose Place"" (as record producer Rick) and ""90210"" as Greg, a teacher and subsequent love interest to Erin Silver."
"In 2009, Matter played a small role in Zack Snyder's ""Watchmen"" film, portraying one of the Minute Men, Byron Lewis/Mothman. He also appeared in the short film accompanying the 'ultimate cut' DVD release of the film entitled ""Under the Hood"", a faux documentary on the Minute Men."
"From 2012 to 2013, Matter played the lead character of Evan Cross, a millionaire inventor searching for anomalies following the brutal killing of his wife by an Albertosaurus, in Space's science fiction series """", a spin-off of the British series ""Primeval"". In 2013, this role earned him a Constellation Award in the Best Male Performance in a Science Fiction Television Episode category, for his performance in the episode ""Truth"". He was also nominated for a Leo Award in the Best Lead Performance by a Male in a Dramatic Series category, for the same episode. Due to low ratings, the series was not renewed for a second season."
"In March 2014, ""Deadline Hollywood"" announced that he had landed the role of Lieutenant Graden Hales in the TNT commissioned pilot of Marcia Clark's ""Guilt by Association"" alongside Julia Stiles, which TNT ultimately declined to pick up."
"He subsequently appeared in guest roles in various American and Canadian series. In CTV's ""Motive"" he played a man driven to murder in revenge for his sister's death; in the short-lived NBC series ""Constantine"" he played a father struggling to deal with the supernatural and in the TNT police procedural ""Rizzoli and Isles"" he portrayed a Detective turned murderer. He also had a recurring role in the third season of the CBC series ""Arctic Air"" as Tag Cummins, the love interest of the series female protagonist, Krista Ivarson, portrayed by Pascale Hutton. Additionally, Matter appeared in the 'VIP Lounge' online content produced to accompany the show, which was available through the series page on the CBC website."
"Matter appeared in the 2014 Calgary International Film Festival's closing gala film, dark-comedy/thriller ""Ally Was Screaming"". He was nominated for a 2015 AMPIA Rosie Award, for his role as Andrew, the abusive estranged husband of the titular Ally. In November 2014 he was announced as one of the Whistler Film Festival's Rising Stars, a program designed to promote the next generation of Western Canadian actors poised for international careers. He also attended the festival's screening of ""Ally Was Screaming"", alongside his castmates."
"Matter joined the main cast of Global's medical drama ""Remedy"" in 2015, for its second season. He played the role of ER Resident Dr Peter Cutler, who develops a romantic relationship with surgeon Dr Melissa Connor, portrayed by Matter's """" castmate Sara Canning."
"In 2016, he guest starred in two episodes of Bravo's ""Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce"" as seedy artist Joaquin. In the same year, he starred as surgeon Dr Clay Castleberry in the Hallmark Channel original movie ""Stop the Wedding"", which was adapted from the novel of the same name by Stephanie Bond. The film's director Anne Wheeler went on to win Best Direction (Television Movie) at the 2017 Leo Awards. He subsequently starred in the W Network film ""A Snow Capped Christmas"", (broadcast as ""Falling for Christmas"" in the US on Up), as former ice-hockey player and single father, Luke."
"2016 also saw Matter star alongside Erin Krakow in the Hallmark Movies & Mysteries film ""Finding Father Christmas"", based on the novel by Robin Jones Gunn, as local lawyer/hotellier Ian McAndrick. At the time of broadcast, the film became the most watched premier in the network's history. Matter and Krakow reprised their roles in a sequel to the film, entitled ""Engaging Father Christmas"" (broadcast as ""A Family for the Holidays"" in Canada and as ""Winter Wedding"" in the UK) which premiered on Hallmark Movies & Mysteries in November 2017."

"The Irish ""long fhada"" seems, from contemporary sources, to have resembled its West Highland equivalent, though there is as yet no archaeological confirmation."
"The ""Annals of the Four Masters"" record the use of fleets in an Irish context, often with a Scottish connection. In 1413 Tuathal Ó Máille, returning from Ulster to Connacht with seven ships, encountered a severe storm (""anfadh na mara"") which drove them northwards to Scotland: only one of the ships survived. In 1433 Macdonald of the Isles arrived in Ulster with a large fleet (""co c-cobhlach mór"") to assist the O'Neills in a war with the O'Donnells."
"In Ireland oared vessels were employed extensively for warfare and piracy by the O'Malleys and the O'Flathertys, western lords whose base was in Connacht. English officials found it necessary to counter them with similar vessels. The most famous of these local rulers was Gráinne Ní Mháille, of whom Sir Richard Bingham reported in 1591 that she had twenty vessels at her command. She, like her father, was engaged in extensive seaborne trade."
"There was constant maritime traffic between Ireland and Scotland, and Highland mercenaries were commonly transported by birlinn to Ireland."
"The birlinn, when rowed, was distinguished by its speed, and could often evade pursuers as a result. No cannon were mounted even in the later period: the birlinn was too lightly built and its freeboard was too low. It was highly suitable for raiding, however, and with experienced marksmen on board, could mount a formidable defence against small craft."
Vessels of this type were at their most vulnerable when beached or when cornered by a heavier vessel carrying cannon.
"There is some evidence that by the end of the sixteenth century new influences were affecting birlinn design. A carving made at Arasaig in 1641 shows a vessel with a lowered stem and stern. An English map of north-east Ireland made no later than 1603 shows ""fleetes of the Redshanks [Highlanders] of Cantyre"" with vessels one-masted as before but with a square sail mounted on a sloping yard arm and a small cabin at the stern projecting backwards. Two Clanranald seals attached to documents dated 1572 show a birlinn with raised decks at stem and stern, a motif repeated in later heraldic devices. If such changes occurred, they would reflect influences from the south-east and ultimately from the Mediterranean. The supporting evidence has been criticised for being slight and unconvincing, but there is pictorial evidence for similar developments in the Irish galley."
= = = Botts' dots = = =
"Botts' dots (turtles in Washington and Oregon or buttons in Texas and other southern states) are round non-reflective raised pavement markers. In many parts of the US and other countries, Botts' dots are used, along with reflective raised pavement markers, to mark lanes on highways and arterial roads. They provide tactile and auditory feedback to drivers when moving across designated travel lanes, and are analogous to rumble strips."
"Botts' dots are named after Elbert Dysart Botts, a California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) engineer credited with overseeing the research that led to the development of the markers."
Botts' dots are most commonly white but may be yellow when used to substitute for the yellow lines that divide opposing directions of traffic in North America. The dots are made of various ceramic materials or plastics such as polyester.
"On some roads, lanes are marked only with a mix of Botts' dots and conventional reflective markers, eliminating the need to repaint lane divider lines. Botts' dots are rarely used in regions with substantial snowfall, because snow plows damage or dislodge them."
"Caltrans engineers may have studied the concept of raised pavement markers as early as 1936. However, the department did not commence research in earnest until 1953, when the postwar economic boom resulted in an alarming increase in the number of cars and car accidents in California. Painted lines tended to become invisible during rain."
"The initial dots were made of glass and were attached to the road by nails or tacks, as suggested by Botts. The nails were soon abandoned: his team discovered that when the dots popped loose under stress, the nails punctured tires. Contrary to a common myth, the published record does not make clear whether Botts invented the famous epoxy that solved the problem; some sources indicate that one of his protégés was responsible for the epoxy. In September 1966, the California State Legislature mandated that Botts' dots be used for lane markings for all state highways in all non-snowfall areas."
"Today, there are more than 25 million Botts' dots in use in California, though they have started falling out of favor. In 2017, Caltrans announced that it would stop using Botts' dots as the sole indicator of lane division, due to cost and worker safety, and in order to make roadways more compatible with self-driving cars. Reflective lane markings will be wider and thicker, providing some of the tactile feedback the Botts' dots provided. In California, highway lanes may be marked either solely by Botts' dots, or dots placed over painted lines. Four dots are used for broken lines on freeways, and broken lines on surface streets may use only three dots. Reflective Stimsonite pavement markers are placed at regular intervals between Botts' dots to increase the visibility of lane markings at night. In the Las Vegas area of southern Nevada, roads with multiple lanes use four pavement markers for each broken white line, a reflective Stimsonite marker followed by three Botts' dots."
"More recently, Botts' dots have been used in the snow-free areas of Alabama, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, Georgia, Washington, and Texas. Some states that do experience snow, particularly Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, use Botts' dots only during the summer months for temporary lane markings in construction zones. Typically, the dots are installed when construction starts in the spring, and they are removed when work stops for the winter."
"In New Mexico, where snow is common in most locations during the winter, Botts' dots are used along with Stimsonite markers to outline gore areas at interchanges, but the state does not use either for regular lane markings on state highways. Some local jurisdictions (notably Alamogordo and Las Cruces) use Botts' dots and Stimsonite markers for regular lane markings on local streets. Botts' dots had also been employed previously in Albuquerque, but the city has since discontinued their use in favor of reflective paint for pavement markings."
"Until the late 1990s, Botts' dots were also used extensively in the snow-free areas of Arizona, however, ADOT has since ended this practice, opting for painted stripes with Stimsonite markers instead. However, they can still be found on US Route 95 south of Yuma, as well as on some local streets in Yuma and Tucson."
"Many states in snow-prone areas of the Midwest and Northeastern United States use Stimsonite reflectors placed into protective metal castings, which allow them to be plowed over without being dislodged from the road surface. These pavement markers are usually augmented with reflective paint and delineators placed on plastic or metal posts at regular intervals along the edges of the road. In California and other locations in the Southwest United States that experience occasional but significant snowfall, the Stimsonite reflectors are placed into recessed pockets in the roadway, which allows visibility during dry weather but permits a plow blade to travel across the reflector without dislodging it, with no special protective castings needed."

"The controller itself is shaped like an ""M"" (similar to a Gamecube controller). Players hold onto the sides of the controller and the part that dips down in the middle contains the battery pack. There are six buttons on the controller (A, B, Start, Select, L, and R), two D-pads, and the system's ""on/off"" switch. The two directional pads are located on either side of the controller at the top. The ""A"" and ""B"" buttons are located below the pad on the right side and the ""Start"" and ""Select"" buttons are located in the same spot on the left side. What would normally be called ""shoulder buttons"" (""L"" and ""R"") are located behind the area where the pads are, on the back of the controller, functioning more as triggers."
"In more traditional 2-dimensional games, the two directional pads are interchangeable. For others with a more 3D environment, like ""Red Alarm"", ""3D Tetris"", or ""Teleroboxer"", each pad controls a different feature. The symmetry of the controller also allows left-handed gamers to reverse the controls (similar to the Atari Lynx)."
"One of the unique features of the controller is the extendable power supply that slides onto the back. It houses the six AA batteries required to power the system. This can be substituted with a wall adapter, though a ""slide on"" attachment is required for the switchout. Once the slide on adapter is installed, a power adapter can be attached to provide constant power."
"During development, Nintendo promised the ability to link systems for competitive play. The system's EXT (extension) port, located on the underside of the system below the controller port, was never officially supported since no ""official"" multiplayer games were ever published, nor was an official link cable released.

= = = Nintendo 64 technical specifications = = =
"This article describes the processor, memory, and other components of the 1996 Nintendo 64 home video game console. It then goes on to explain the specs of the Nintendo 64's components in more detail, and details the sub components therein."
"The Nintendo 64's central processing unit (CPU) is the NEC VR4300, a licensed variant of the 64-bit MIPS Technologies R4300i, itself a cost-reduced derivative of the MIPS R4200. Built by NEC on a 350 nm process, the VR4300 is a RISC 5-stage scalar in-order execution processor, internal 24 KB direct-mapped L1 cache (16 KB for instructions, 8 KB for data). Although a floating-point unit exists as a logical coprocessor, there is no dedicated physical FPU datapath on the VR4300; instead, the integer pipeline is shared for this purpose, meaning that floating-point instructions will stall the pipeline. The 4.6 million transistor CPU is cooled passively by an aluminum heatspreader that makes contact with a steel heat sink above."
"With a clock rate of 93.75 MHz, the N64's VR4300 is generally considered to be the most powerful console CPU of the fifth generation of video game consoles. Except for its narrower 32-bit system bus, the VR4300 retains the computational abilities of the 64-bit MIPS R4200, though few titles take advantage of 64-bit data precision operations. N64 game titles generally use faster and more compact 32-bit data-operations, as these are sufficient to generate 3D scene data for the console's RSP (Reality Signal Processor) unit. In addition, 32-bit code executes faster and requires less storage space, which came at a premium with contemporary technology. The CPU is constrained by a 562.5 MB/s bus to the system RAM, and in order to access the RAM, the CPU must go through the Reality Coprocessor (RCP), and can not use DMA to do so as the RCP can. This issue is further compounded by the RDRAM's high access latency."
"Programs emulating the Nintendo 64 benefit from the scarcity of 64-bit operations in the game's executable code, especially when running with a 32-bit machine architecture as a host. Most of these emulators perform the majority of calculations at 32-bit precision and trap the few subroutines that actually make use of 64-bit instructions."
"Nintendo 64's graphics and audio duties are performed by the 64-bit SGI coprocessor, named the Reality Coprocessor, or RCP. The RCP is a 62.5 MHz chip split internally into two major components, the Reality Display Processor (RDP) and the Reality Signal Processor (RSP). Each area communicates with the other by way of a 128-bit internal data bus that provides 1.0 GB/s of bandwidth. The RSP is a MIPS R4000-based 128-bit integer vector processor. It is programmable through microcode, allowing the chip's functions to be significantly altered by each software title if necessary, to allow for different types of work, precision, and workloads. A number of microcodes were provided by Nintendo, while a few companies, such as Rare and Factor 5, would later develop their own microcodes. The RSP performs transform, clipping and lighting calculations, and triangle setup. The Reality Display Processor is primarily the Nintendo 64's pixel rasterizer, and also handles the console's Z-buffer compute."
"The RCP was developed by SGI's Nintendo Operations department, led by engineer Dr. Wei Yen (who later founded ArtX in 1997). The RCP was manufactured by NEC, using its 350 nm 3LM CMOS process, which NEC had introduced in 1994. The processor contains 2.6million transistors manufactured using this process. The processor has a size of 81 mm², giving it a transistor density of over 32,000 per square mm."
"Instead of a discrete sound processor, the RSP frequently performs audio functions, although the CPU can be tasked with this as well. It can play back most types of audio (dependent on software codecs) including uncompressed PCM, MP3, MIDI, and tracker music. The RSP is theoretically capable of a maximum of 100 channels of PCM at a time, but only in a case where all system resources are devoted to audio. It has a maximum sampling rate of 48 kHz with 16-bit audio. In practice, however, storage limitations caused by the ROM cartridge format limit the audio size and thus quality. Some game titles are designed for higher quality audio when storage expansions are available, as with ""F-Zero X Expansion Kit""."
"The RDP performs rasterization, converting images into raster format before output to the display. The RCP also provides the CPU's access to main system memory via a 562.5 MB/s bus. Unfortunately, this link does not allow direct memory access for the CPU. The RCP, like the CPU, is passively cooled by an aluminum heatspreader that makes contact with a steel heat sink above."
"The final major component in the system is the random-access memory, or RAM. Following its design heritage in SGI supercomputing, the Nintendo 64 implemented a unified memory architecture (UMA), instead of having separate banks of memory for CPU, audio, and video, as seen on its competitors. The RAM itself consists of 4.5 megabytes (0.5 MB for anti-aliasing) of Rambus RDRAM, fabricated by NEC. System RAM is expandable to a total of 9 MB with the Expansion Pak. The RAM has a 9-bit data bus at 250 MHz; as RDRAM transfers data at both the rising and falling edge of the signal (a technique also known as DDR), it provides the system with 562.5 MB/s peak bandwidth, shared between CPU and RCP."
"Rambus technology was quite new at the time and offered Nintendo a way to provide a large amount of bandwidth at a relatively low cost. The narrow bus makes board design easier and cheaper than the higher width data buses required for high bandwidth out of slower-clocked RAM types (such as VRAM or EDO DRAM); this way, the N64 mainboard could be designed with only 2 layers. However, RDRAM, at the time, came with a very high access latency. The combination of high bandwidth and high latency meant that significant effort was required from developers to achieve optimal results. Early N64 revisions use two 18 Mbit RAM chips; in ca. 1998 these were replaced with a single 36 Mbit chip, same as was used on the Expansion Pak."
"The Nintendo 64 Game Pak ROM cartridges are much faster than contemporary CD-ROM drives that data can be streamed in real-time from cartridges as if they are additional RAM, thus maximizing the efficiency of the system's RAM. This was a common practice for developers of many games, such as Nintendo EAD's ""Super Mario 64"" or Factor 5's ""Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine""."
"The system allows for video output in two formats: composite video and S-Video. This is accomplished through the proprietary ""MULTI OUT"" connector on the rear of the system, which was carried over from the SNES and later reused on the GameCube. Although the digital-to-analog converter chip used in early models had the capability to produce RGB video, it was not connected by default for this purpose, and later revisions lacked the pin connections for this purpose entirely."
"The system came bundled with a composite cable (labeled Stereo A/V cable by Nintendo). Available separately (and included with the system in the UK) were a RF modulator and switch set (for connection to older televisions) and an official S-Video cable, although the latter was only sold at retail stores in Japan. In the U.S., the official S-Video cable could only be ordered direct from Nintendo of America, while in PAL territories, no S-Video cable was officially sold altogether. Furthermore, Nintendo omitted several components from the S-Video signal path in PAL consoles, meaning that using an unmodified NTSC S-Video cable will result in an overbright, garish image, or no image at all."
= = = Frisch–Peierls memorandum = = =
The Frisch–Peierls memorandum was the first technical exposition of a practical nuclear weapon. It was written by expatriate German physicists Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls in March 1940 while they were both working for Mark Oliphant at the University of Birmingham in Britain during World War II.
The memorandum contained the first calculations about the size of the critical mass of fissile material needed for an atomic bomb. It revealed for the first time that the amount required might be small enough to incorporate into a bomb that could be delivered by air. It also anticipated the strategic and moral implications of nuclear weapons.
"It helped send both Britain and America down a path which led to the MAUD Committee, the Tube Alloys project, the Manhattan Project, and ultimately the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki."
"Rudolf Peierls was born in Berlin in 1907. He studied physics at the University of Berlin, at the University of Munich under Arnold Sommerfeld, the University of Leipzig under Werner Heisenberg, and ETH Zurich under Wolfgang Pauli. After receiving his DPhil from Leipzig in 1929, he became an assistant to Pauli in Zurich. In 1932, he was awarded a Rockefeller Fellowship, which he used to study in Rome under Enrico Fermi, and then at the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge under Ralph H. Fowler. Due to Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany, he elected to not return home in 1933, but to remain in Britain. He worked with Hans Bethe at the University of Manchester, then at the Mond Laboratory at Cambridge. In 1937, Mark Oliphant, the Australian, newly appointed professor of physics at the University of Birmingham recruited him for a new chair there in applied mathematics."
"Otto Robert Frisch was born in Vienna in 1904. He studied physics at the University of Vienna, from which he received his DPhil in 1926. He worked at the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt in Berlin until 1930, when he obtained a position at the University of Hamburg under the Nobel Prize-winning scientist Otto Stern. As non-Aryans, Stern and Frisch were dismissed after Hitler's accession. Stern found Frisch a position in Britain with Patrick Blackett at Birbeck College at the University of London, and a grant from the Academic Assistance Council. He followed this with a five-year stint at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen with Niels Bohr where he increasingly specialised in nuclear physics, particularly the physics of neutrons, which had been discovered by James Chadwick in 1932. Oliphant invited Frisch to come to the University of Birmingham in the summer of 1939. When the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 prevented his return to Copenhagen, Oliphant found him a position at the University of Birmingham."
"During the Christmas holiday in 1938, Frisch visited his aunt Lise Meitner in Kungälv in Sweden, where she had been forced to relocate after Germany's annexation of Austria made her a German citizen. While there she received the news that her former colleagues Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in Berlin had discovered that the collision of a neutron with a uranium nucleus produced barium as one of its byproducts. Frisch and Meitner hypothesized that the uranium nucleus had split in two. They estimated the energy released at around 200 MeV, and Frisch appropriated the term fission from biology to describe it. Hahn's paper described the experiment and the finding of the barium byproduct. Meitner's and Frisch's paper explained the physics behind the phenomenon. Frisch went back to Copenhagen, where he was able to isolate the fragments produced by fission reactions. Frisch later recalled that:"
"The news of the discovery of fission was brought to America by Bohr in January 1939. Bohr and John A. Wheeler set to work applying the liquid drop model developed by Bohr and Fritz Kalckar to explain the mechanism of nuclear fission. George Placzek, who was skeptical about the whole idea of fission, challenged Bohr to explain why uranium seemed to fission with both very fast and very slow neutrons. Bohr had an epiphany that the fission at low energies was due to the uranium-235 isotope, while at high energies it was mainly due to the more abundant uranium-238 isotope. The former makes up just 0.7% of natural uranium; while that latter accounts for 99.3%. On 16 April, Bohr, Placzek, Wheeler, Eugene Wigner and Leon Rosenfeld discussed whether it would be possible to use a nuclear chain reaction to make an atomic bomb, and concluded that it was not. Bohr observed that ""It would take the entire efforts of a country to make a bomb."""
"In Britain, scientists also considered whether an atomic bomb was practical. At the University of Liverpool, Chadwick and the Polish refugee scientist Joseph Rotblat tackled the problem, but their calculations were inconclusive. At Cambridge, Nobel Prize in Physics laureates George Paget Thomson and William Lawrence Bragg wanted the government to take urgent action to acquire uranium ore to keep it out of German hands. The Secretary of the Committee for Imperial Defence, Major General Hastings Ismay asked Sir Henry Tizard for an opinion. Tizard was sceptical of the likelihood of an atomic bomb being developed, reckoning the odds of success at 100,000 to 1."
"Even at such long odds, the danger was sufficiently great to be taken seriously. It was not considered worthwhile to immediately acquire the uranium, but Tizard's Committee on the Scientific Survey of Air Defence was directed to conduct research into the feasibility of atomic bombs. Thomson, at Imperial College London, and Oliphant, at the University of Birmingham, were tasked with carrying out a series of experiments on uranium. By February 1940, Thomson's team had failed to create a chain reaction in natural uranium, and he had decided that it was not worth pursuing."
"As enemy aliens, at least until Peierls' naturalisation papers came through in February 1940, Frisch and Peierls were excluded from the most important–and secret–war work being done by Oliphant's team at Birmingham, that on radar. However, Oliphant would ask Peierls a theoretical question about, say, the solution to Maxwell's equations in a hemispheric cavity. Peierls knew that questions of this nature related to the work on microwave radar, and Oliphant was doubtless aware of this too, but the façade of secrecy was maintained. The nuclear investigation was not yet secret, so Frisch was available to work on it. He began experimenting with uranium enrichment through thermal diffusion, a process first demonstrated in Germany by Klaus Clusius. Progress was slow; the required equipment was not available, and the radar project had first call on the available resources."
"Francis Perrin had defined a critical mass of uranium to be the smallest amount that could sustain a chain reaction, and had calculated the critical mass of uranium oxide (not metal) to be about . He reckoned that if a neutron reflector were placed around it of materials such as iron or lead which did not greatly impede fast neutrons, this might be reduced to . Peierls also attempted to simplify the problem by using the fast neutrons produced by fission, thus omitting consideration of moderator. He then calculated the critical mass of a sphere of uranium metal in a theoretical paper written in 1939. He later recalled that the size of the critical mass ""was of the order of tons. It therefore appeared to me that the paper had no relevance to a nuclear weapon."""
"However, Bohr had argued that the uranium-235 isotope was far more likely to capture neutrons, so fissile even using neutrons of low energy. Frisch wondered what would happen if he were able to produce a sphere of pure uranium-235. When he used Peierls' formula to calculate this, he received a startling answer. Peierls later observed that:"
"Realising the sensitive nature of the document, Peierls typed it himself. One carbon copy was made."
Today the original is in the Bodleian Library at Oxford University.
The memorandum was written in two parts. The first was an elegant and comprehensive outline of the implications of their calculations. It included a proposal that the best defence against such a weapon would be to develop one before Germany did so. In a few short pages these two scientists anticipated the policies of deterrence which would shape Cold War geopolitics. The second was an explanation of the science supporting their conclusions. The memorandum opens with:
"Peierls' starting point was a paper by Francis Perrin, in which he had derived critical mass calculations in terms of nuclear constants. The physicists considered a sphere, which has the minimum surface area for a given volume. A critical mass occurs when the number of neutrons produced equals the number that escape. Perrin assumed that the mean free path was much larger than the radius of the sphere. Peierls did not agree, and commenced his own calculations. A key insight came from Frisch, who wondered what would happen if, instead of natural uranium, someone gave you a sphere of the uranium-235 isotope, By definition, the mean free path is:"
"where is the mean free path, is the number of target particles per unit volume, and is the effective fission cross section area. Peierls did not perform the calculation, leaving this task to Frisch. The chemistry of uranium was not well known at the time, and Frisch believed that its density was ; the true value is more like . The fission cross section value was more problematic. For this, Frisch turned to a 1939 ""Nature"" article by L. A. Goldstein, A. Rogozinski and R. J. Walen at the Radium Institute in Paris, who gave a value of . This was too large by an order of magnitude; a modern value is about . Using the values he had, Frisch calculated the value of the mean free path for uranium-235 using Avogadro's constant:"
"Peierls and Frisch claimed that the critical radius was about 0.8 times the mean free path. From this, Frisch could calculate the volume of the sphere from the well-known equation:"
The mass then comes out to be:
"Frisch and Peierls then considered the speed of a uranium fission chain reaction, exponential in nature, where ""τ is the time required for the neutron density to multiply by a factor ""e""."" The available data was very approximate, but their central point – that a bomb was possible using fast (~2MeV) neutrons – remains. Jeremy Bernstein remarked of this effort: ""Let me make the same point by asking a somewhat different question but using the correct numbers. How much time does it take to fission a kilogram of U using fast neutrons?"" Using modern values he found that to be ""equal to about a microsecond, which makes the point about the rapidity of fission with fact [sic] neutrons""."
"In the original memorandum, if the neutrons had velocities of 10 cm/s, then they would have an average time between fission collisions of . Therefore, Bernstein's time for a kilogram of uranium-235 to fission is found by solving:"
"where was the mean time for fission neutron density to increase by ""e"". Given the doubling-time"
this implied a mean fission exponential folding time of
"This led to a calculation of the energy released, which Peierls reckoned as approximately:"
"where ""M"" is the mass of the sphere, ""r"" is the radius, and ""r"" is the critical mass radius."
The conclusion drawn was that a few kilograms would explode with the energy of thousands of tons of dynamite.
"The memorandum was given to Oliphant, who passed it on to Tizard in his capacity as the chairman of the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Warfare (CSSAW). He in turn passed it to Thomson, the chairman of the committee to which the CSSAW had delegated responsibility for uranium research. Thomson's committee was about to disband. It had studied nuclear reactions in uranium, and the use of graphite as a neutron moderator in a nuclear reactor, but its results had been negative, and it had concluded that the rate of capture of neutrons by the graphite was too great to make such a reactor a practical proposition. The Frisch–Peierls memorandum caused Thomson to reconsider. After discussions between Cockcroft, Oliphant and Thomson, CSSAW created the MAUD Committee to investigate further. As enemy aliens, Peierls and Frisch were initially excluded from its deliberations, but they were later added to its technical subcommittee."
"The research from the MAUD committee was compiled in two reports, commonly known as the MAUD reports in July 1941. The first report, ""Use of Uranium for a Bomb"", discussed the feasibility of creating a super-bomb from uranium, which they now thought to be true. The second, ""Use of Uranium as a Source of Power"" discussed the idea of using uranium as a source of power, not just a bomb. The MAUD Committee and report helped bring about the British nuclear program, the Tube Alloys Project. Not only did it help start a nuclear project in Britain but it helped jump-start the American project. Without the help of the MAUD Committee the American program, the Manhattan Project, would have started months behind. Instead they were able to begin thinking about how to create a bomb, not whether it was possible. Historian Margaret Gowing noted that ""events that change a time scale by only a few months can nevertheless change history."""
"In August 1941, Oliphant was sent to the US to assist the Americans with microwave radar. He took the initiative to enlighten the scientific community there of the ground-breaking discoveries of the MAUD Committee. He travelled to Berkeley to meet with his friend Ernest Lawrence, who soon caught his enthusiasm. Oliphant convinced the Americans to move forward with nuclear weapons, and his lobbying resulted in Vannevar Bush taking the report directly to the president. Leo Szilard later wrote: ""if Congress knew the true history of the atomic energy project, I have no doubt but that it would create a special medal to be given to meddling foreigners for distinguished services, and that Dr Oliphant would be the first to receive one."""
"On July 13, Arum issued a July 16 midnight deadline for Mayweather. ""Mayweather has until the end of the week. He could wait until the last minute. If it's Friday [July 16] and it's 11 p.m., and he says we have a deal, we have a deal,"" Arum would explain to Dan Rafael of ESPN. On July 15, Top Rank's website unveiled an official countdown to the deadline entitled ""Money"" Time: Mayweather's Decision."
"As soon as the deadline for Mayweather's response expired, Arum held a conference call. Arum revealed to the media that the negotiations he had been referring to consisted of a series of conversations with HBO Sports President Ross Greenburg. He also revealed that there was no actual direct communication with any representative from Team Mayweather or Golden Boy Promotions. ""I had a couple of conversations with Ross [Greenburg] and I laid out all the terms that would be acceptable to our side and I also informed him about the concession that Manny had made regarding drug testing. He got back to me in a couple of weeks and told me that he had had discussions with Al Haymon, representing Floyd Mayweather, and that everything looked good and we were nearing a resolution,"" Arum explained. During a Q & A session following his opening statement, Arum further explained, ""We have never talked to anybody on the Mayweather side and all conversations on our part were through Ross Greenburg and he reported on all conversations on the Mayweather side from Al Haymon."""
"On July 19, 2010, Ellerbe denied that negotiations ever took place and said nothing was ever agreed on. ""Here are the facts: Al Haymon, Richard Schaefer and myself speak to each other on a regular basis and the truth is no negotiations have ever taken place nor was there ever a deal agreed upon by Team Mayweather or Floyd Mayweather to fight Manny Pacquiao on November 13. Either Ross Greenburg or Bob Arum is not telling the truth, but history tells us who is lying,"" stated Ellerbe. Three days later, Schaefer backed Ellerbe's statement that negotiations never took place."
"Regarding comments he made suggesting that contracts for the megafight were close to being finalized, De La Hoya told BoxingScene.com on July 26, ""I think I said it because I get the question asked so many times that, obviously, I was fed up and tired of it and I just said like, yeah, yeah, it's gonna get made. So it was a quick answer that I should have obviously thought about. But, obviously, negotiations weren't going on. Nothing was going on."""
"Also on July 26, Greenburg released a statement saying he had been negotiating with a representative from each side since May 2, ""I had been negotiating with a representative from each side since May 2, carefully trying to put the fight together. Hopefully, someday this fight will happen. Sports fans deserve it,"" Greenburg revealed in a prepared statement sent out to select members of the media. Schaefer again supported Ellerbe's denial of negotiations and challenged both Greenburg and Arum to take lie detector tests. ""I think it's unfortunate that Ross made that statement. I fully stand behind the statement I made. I have not negotiated with Ross and I am not aware of any negotiations that have taken place,"" Schaefer told ESPN."
"On September 2, 2010, Mayweather unleashed a profanity-filled racist internet rant against Pacquiao via Ustream. He was misquoted as referring to Pacquiao as ""a yellow chump"" but he actually called him a ""little young chump"" and said, ""Once I stomp the midget, I’ll make that queer make me a sushi roll and cook me some rice."" In addition, he said, ""I'm going to cook that [expletive] with cats and dogs. Have some rice with a little barbecue dog."" The following day Mayweather apologized. ""I want to apologize to everybody.  ... I don't have a racist bone in my body, you know. I love everybody,"" Mayweather said. ""I was just having fun. I didn't really mean it, nothing in a bad way."""
"On July 8, 2011, ESPN reported that Pacquiao was willing to agree to random drug testing—but not by USADA. ""We have agreed in the Pacquiao camp to unlimited random testing done by a responsible, neutral organization,"" Arum told Yahoo!. ""We don't believe USADA is a neutral organization. I don't think anybody's test is as vigorous as the test administered by the Olympic Organization. And we can arrange for the Olympic Organization to handle the test under the supervision of the Athletic commission respective of the state where the fight is going to be held."" However, the following day, Pacquiao's top adviser, Michael Koncz, stated that Pacquiao had never agreed to testing all the way up to fight day. ""Will we give blood five days, seven days before the fight? You know, that's something I have to talk to Manny about, but we have nothing to hide,"" Koncz said."
"On January 20, 2012, Mayweather spoke directly to Pacquiao via telephone. ""He ask about a 50/50 split,"" Mayweather said. ""I told him no that can't happen, but what can happen is you can make more money fighting me then you have made in your career."" Mayweather offered to pay a flat fee of USD 40 million for a proposed fight but would not allow Pacquiao to share in the revenue. Pacquiao said, ""I spoke to Floyd ...and he offered me an amount. He didn't talk about the pay-per-views here and that's it. I can't agree with that. I told him I agree with 55 and 45 (split)."""
"Pacquiao appeared on the ESPN program ""First Take"" on September 20, 2012, and said he had no problem with the drug-testing issue. ""Whatever he wants to do,"" Pacquiao said. He said he was willing to be tested even on the night of the fight. On September 25, Mayweather and Pacquiao reached a confidential settlement in their federal defamation case. In a statement released through the mediator in the case, the Mayweathers said they ""wish to make it clear that they never intended to claim that Manny Pacquiao has used or is using any performance-enhancing drugs, nor are they aware of any evidence that Manny Pacquiao has used performance-enhancing drugs."""
"The ""Telegraph"" reported on December 20, that Mayweather said Pacquiao’s association with promoter Bob Arum is the reason why the bout will not happen. ""We all know the Pacquiao fight, at this particular time, will never happen, and the reason why the fight won't happen is because I will never do business with Bob Arum again in life, and Pacquiao is Bob Arum's fighter,"" Mayweather said."
"On January 7, 2014, Fighthype.com published an interview with Mayweather in which he called Pacquiao a ""desperate dog"" who is chasing a megabout due to his tax problems. In response, Pacquiao challenged Mayweather to a fight for charity. ""I challenge him to include in our fight contract that both of us will not receive anything out of this fight,"" Pacquiao said. ""We will donate all the proceeds from the fight—guaranteed prize, should there be any, gate receipts, pay-per-view and endorsements—to charities around the world."" He added, ""Floyd, if you’re a real man, fight me. Let’s do it for the love of boxing and for the fans. Let’s do it not for the sake of money. Let’s make the boxing fans happy."""
"As reported by at least five major media outlets (""USA Today"", ""Los Angeles Times"", ""The Hollywood Reporter"", ""The Wall Street Journal"" and the ""New York Post""), serious negotiations leading to success were kickstarted in May 2014 by a very unlikely source: a Hollywood waiter/actor named Gabriel Salvador (Bones, Bluebloods, Rizzoli & Isles, ). Salvador forged a friendship with CBS Network President Leslie Moonves when Moonves became a regular at Craig's restaurant in West Hollywood, where Salvador worked part-time as a waiter and where his son Elijah worked out at Freddie Roach's gym. Salvador and Moonves bonded over their mutual love of boxing. CBS is the parent company of the Showtime Network, which had invested heavily in boxing and spent top-dollar on a multi-year deal with Mayweather. Salvador told Moonves that he believed he could make the fight happen if he could get Moonves together with Pacquiao confidant and trainer Roach. Salvador believed he could do so based on his connection to both men and his ""unshakeable feeling"" that together they could cut through the politicking and power struggles that seemed to have stymied prior negotiations. Moonves agreed that Salvador should approach Roach to make an introduction with a view to making the fight a reality. Eventually, Salvador approached Roach and asked him if he would be willing to meet with Moonves to get the wheels in motion. Roach agreed and asked Salvador to set up a meeting."
"The first meeting between Moonves and Roach took place on May 28, 2014, at the Scarpetta restaurant in the Montage Hotel in Beverly Hills, which Salvador attended. Both Roach and Moonves agreed the long-awaited bout had to happen and Roach gave Moonves the green-light to start making things happen. Roach later helped Moonves make peace with Pacquiao promoter Bob Arum. Moonves then brought the warring elements from both boxers' camps together and, with Salvador's help, even arranged meetings at his home. After difficult negotiations, it was not long after that both camps agreed to fight on the night of May 2, 2015. The consensus is that but for Salvador's key introduction, the fight would not have happened. Both Moonves and Pacquiao promoter Bob Arum have confirmed Salvador's pivotal role."
"For his role, Salvador maintains that he is a ""finder"" entitled to a finder's fee. But Salvador has yet to be paid that fee by either CBS or Roach/Pacquiao. The fight grossed more than $600 million, with the television networks taking in more than $400 million and Pacquiao grossing more than $160 million."
"On December 12, 2014, Mayweather proposed a May 2, 2015, fight with Pacquiao, citing his indirect frustration at not being able to make the fight happen in the past by stating that Pacquiao had lost to both Juan Manuel Márquez and Timothy Bradley respectively. He also stated that he (Pacquiao) was ""not on his level"". Mayweather then went on to close his comments with, ""Let's make this fight happen for the people and for the fans."""
"On January 13, Pacquiao agreed to terms for the fight. Bob Arum claimed that now only Mayweather's camp was holding up an official agreement. On January 27, Mayweather and Pacquiao finally met each other face to face for the first time during an NBA game between the Miami Heat and Milwaukee Bucks in Miami. Pacquiao said they exchanged phone numbers and would communicate with each other. Pacquiao's advisor, Michael Koncz, said that the two future Hall of Famers later met at Pacquiao's hotel for about an hour to discuss the pending superfight and work out the remaining issues. Top Rank promoter Bob Arum expressed optimism that the fight could be finalized by Super Bowl Sunday at the soonest and that there would be no further deadlines for the fight, stating that the negotiations are nearly complete. On January 30, TMZ reported that the fight had been agreed upon by both sides and that a formal announcement would be made in the ""next couple of days."" However, members from both sides, including Bob Arum and Stephen Espinoza, refuted the report, saying that the deal had not been finalized yet and that negotiations on what would be a joint pay-per-view (Showtime–HBO) telecast of the fight were still clearing out the last significant issues before the deal could be finalized."
"On February 20, Mayweather announced that the fight was official and a contract had been signed for a fight to take place on May 2, 2015, at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. The fight was expected to shatter PPV buy records and gross millions of dollars with the ticket prices ranging from $3,500 to $250,000 and the PPV was expected to cost USD 89.95 for SD and USD 99.95 for HD. Boxing experts predicted the match would be the richest fight in boxing history and would generate $300 million."
<br><br>
"Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao was held at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. Tickets for the fight went on sale on April 23 after an agreement had been reached over ticket allocation. Only 500 tickets went on sale to the public, priced at $1,500, $2,500, $3,500, $5,000 and $7,500 for the 16,800 capacity MGM Grand. The tickets that went on sale sold out within a minute. As per the contract, the first $160 million of revenue and the revenue above $180 million from the fight was split 60/40 between the fighters, with Mayweather receiving the larger 60% share. Revenue between $160 million and $180 million was to be split 51/49, with the 51% share going to the winner. Both fighters were expected to earn at least $100 million in revenue from their participation. Although the event was jointly promoted by Mayweather Promotions and Top Rank, the contract named Mayweather Promotions as the lead promoter of the fight. Both fighters agreed to undergo drug testing by the United States Anti-Doping Agency, including random blood and urine testing prior to the fight, a test following the fight and a ban from professional boxing for four years if they test positive. Neither fighter has failed a drug test during their professional career."
"Kenny Bayless served as the in-ring referee, as chosen by the Nevada Athletic Commission. Bayless has previously officiated five of Mayweather's past bouts and seven of Pacquiao's and he earned a record $25,000 for officiating this fight. Burt Clements, Dave Moretti and Glenn Feldman served as judges. The U.S. national anthem, ""The Star-Spangled Banner"", was performed by Jamie Foxx. The Philippine national anthem, ""Lupang Hinirang"", was performed by Filipino-American singer Gail Banawis, joined by The Word Chorale—a choir of Filipino pastors."
"A large number of celebrities were in attendance; singer Justin Bieber was among Mayweather's entourage, while Pacquiao was joined by comedian Jimmy Kimmel—who had discussed the possibility of entering with him when Pacquiao appeared on his talk show ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"". Kimmel wore an outfit parodying Bieber's wardrobe from a pre-fight press conference and photobombed a pre-fight photo taken by Pacquiao. Other figures in attendance included Steffi Graf and Andre Agassi, Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Charles Barkley, Mike Tyson, Clint Eastwood, Robert De Niro, Denzel Washington, Michael J. Fox, Donald Trump, Jake Gyllenhaal, Amir Khan, Drew Barrymore, Jesse Jackson, Russell Westbrook, Mark Wahlberg, Lewis Hamilton, Leonardo DiCaprio, Don Cheadle, Michael Jordan, Sugar Ray Leonard, Paris Hilton, Nicki Minaj, Meek Mill, Ben Affleck, The Jonas Brothers, Michael Keaton, Tom Brady, Magic Johnson, Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Evander Holyfield, Mariah Carey, Sting, 50 Cent and others."
"As both Pacquiao and Mayweather had exclusive relationships with the broadcasters, HBO and Showtime, at the time of the fight, the telecast of the fight was a joint production between HBO World Championship Boxing and Showtime Championship Boxing. This marked the first collaboration between the two American premium television services since Lennox Lewis vs. Mike Tyson in 2002. It was executive produced and directed by Showtime's David Dinkins Jr. and Bob Dunphy and featured a mix of Showtime and HBO personalities. The ringside announcers for the fight included Roy Jones Jr. (HBO), Al Bernstein (Showtime) and Jim Lampley (HBO) provided analysis. Max Kellerman (HBO) and Jim Gray (Showtime) covered the locker rooms of Pacquiao and Mayweather, respectively. James Brown and Paulie Malignaggi of Showtime hosted the pre-fight show."
"The broadcast was, in most regions, distributed as a pay-per-view event. In the United States, the PPV cost was USD 89.95 (with an additional $10 charge for HD), a 40% increase over the PPV cost of Mayweather's 2013 fight against Canelo Álvarez. Rights to screen the fight in commercial venues such as bars and restaurants were administered by G&G Sports, with costs based upon venue size and other factors, reaching as high as $5,000 for a 257-seat establishment. Due to concerns that they may not have been able to recoup the cost of the PPV through cover charges and drink sales, some bars decided against screening the fight at all. Both HBO and Showtime aired encores of the fight the following Saturday, May 9, 2015."
"Both Showtime and HBO broadcast documentary specials focusing on the two fighters as part of the lead-up to the fight; Showtime produced the Mayweather-focused ""Inside Mayweather vs. Pacquiao""—with three episodes focusing on Mayweather's preparations for the event and an epilogue which aired the week following the fight, while HBO aired a one-hour Pacquiao-focused ""Mayweather/Pacquiao: At Last"", as well as encores of past Pacquiao fights. Showtime's sister outlet CBS Sports Network also aired supplemental programming, including encores of ""Inside Mayweather vs. Pacquiao"" and past Mayweather fights, live coverage of the weigh-in, special broadcasts of ""The Doug Gottlieb Show"" and ""Boomer and Carton"" from Las Vegas and coverage of the post-fight press conference."
"In Pacquiao's native country of the Philippines, Solar Entertainment held broadcast rights to the fight, reportedly paying $10 million (PHP 440 million). The telecast was made available via commercial free pay-per-view on the television providers Cignal and SkyCable, and at the locations of theatre chain SM Cinema (including IMAX theaters) and the Mall of Asia Arena. Unlike previous Pacquiao fights, whose free-to-air rights were held by GMA Network as part of a sub-licensing arrangement, a ""slightly-delayed"" telecast of the fight was simulcast by Solar Sports, GMA and the rival commercial networks ABS-CBN and TV5. Solar Sports President Wilson Tieng said that Pacquiao personally requested the joint broadcast due to its historic nature, and that ""everybody agreed to set aside all their differences to make sure that this will become the biggest event ever in Philippine television history."" GMA held exclusive radio rights to the fight."
"In Europe, generally, the fight was broadcast via PPV (Austria, United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Spain). Only a few TV holders in Europe decided otherwise – TVP (Poland), Sport 1 (Czech Republic and Hungary) and Discovery Italy (Deejay TV and DMAX). Sky Sports Box Office won exclusive television rights in the UK to the bout, and produced a four episode broadcast leading up to the event titled ""Mayweather vs. Pacquiao: Countdown""."
"Sportsmax TV and Cleeng offered the fight via PPV in 19 Caribbean countries, including Barbados, Jamaica, Surinam and Trinidad & Tobago."
"Due to the high profile of the event and the high price of the PPV, there were significant concerns surrounding piracy of the fight's telecast by either bars (which were required to purchase a higher-priced commercial license to televise the event, and were not legally allowed to purchase it through their television provider) or by online streaming services, with ""TorrentFreak"" going on to report that Mayweather vs. Pacquiao was ""destined to become the most pirated live sports event in history"". Organizers were especially concerned about the mobile broadcasting apps Meerkat and Periscope due to their relative ease of use and accessibility, as viewers could simply film their television screen with their phones to make a stream available."
"Alongside monitoring activities during the event, actions were also preemptively taken against several sites that advertised plans to illegally stream the fight. In the Philippines, the Philippine National Police's Anti-Cybercrime Group arrested the operator of a streaming service after a complaint by ABS-CBN and was granted a temporary restraining order in a Florida court for its infringements of copyrights and trademarks. HBO and Showtime filed a similar lawsuit against two other streaming services that advertised an intent to offer the fight under (which allows for preemptive claims of copyright infringement against those conspiring to infringe the copyrights of a broadcast) and a court issued a restraining order against the sites and all parties in ""active concert or participation with any of them, including any and all service providers who receive notice of this order"". The Electronic Frontier Foundation criticized the wide reach of the order, arguing that the clause of ""any and all service providers who receive notice of this order"" was comparable to the provisions of the previously proposed Stop Online Piracy Act, theorizing that other parties not originally named could become subject to the injunction by merely receiving notice of the order."
"A large number of Periscope streams were used to broadcast the fight, either indirectly with a focus on reactions from viewing parties, or simply rebroadcasting television feeds of the fight. One stream reportedly peaked at around 10,000 viewers, although these streams had inconsistent uptime due either to connection issues or to being reported and taken down by the service. Representatives of both Meerkat and Periscope reported that they acted upon takedown notices received throughout the evening. ESPN's Ryan McGee dubbed Periscope the ""winner"" of the fight due to the prominence it received through this manner. Dick Costolo, CEO of microblogging service and Periscope parent company Twitter, made a similar remark; although it was initially assumed to be in reference to the illegal streams, he clarified that it was actually in reference to HBO's usage of the service to stream behind-the-scenes from the fighters' locker rooms."
"The winner of the fight received a newly created belt by the WBC. The belt, valued at $1 million, is an exact replica of the current belt, except it has thousands of emeralds in place of the gold plating for the center logo. The belt also contains the faces of both Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao, along with the faces of the former WBC President, José Sulaimán and boxing legend Muhammad Ali. Two belts were initially made for the fight. The green emerald belt won the public fan vote over the black onyx belt with a vote of 53% to 47%."
"Both fighters wore eight-ounce (230 g) gloves with brands of their choosing. Mayweather wore custom Grant gloves with a multicolored paisley pattern, red & purple trim and the letters TBE (The Best Ever) on the cuff. Pacquiao wore standard red Cleto Reyes gloves with black & white trim. In Pacquiao's third professional loss to Érik Morales, he was forced to use Winning brand gloves the first time around. Pacquiao's complaints were that the gloves felt like ""pillows"" and they did not give him the same power as his Reyes ""puncher's gloves."" More recently, Mayweather had glove issues in his first bout with Marcos Maidana, stating that Maidana's Everlast MX gloves did not provide sufficient padding for the knuckles. The issue was later resolved with Marcos Maidana resorting to using Everlast Powerlock type gloves, leaving Maidana's trainer, Robert Garcia, unhappy with the negotiation."
"On the July 3 ""SmackDown"", Ziggler defeated Alex Riley to qualify for a spot in the World Heavyweight Championship Money in the Bank ladder match.

Six days later at the Royal Rumble, Ziggler entered at number one and lasted nearly fifty minutes before being eliminated by Sheamus. During the match, Ziggler resumed his feud with the returning Chris Jericho whom Ziggler managed to eliminate. The following night on ""Raw"", Ziggler and Jericho were placed in a ""Strange Bedfellows"" match against WWE Tag Team Champions Team Hell No (Daniel Bryan and Kane), but they lost when Kane hit a chokeslam on Ziggler and pinned him after Jericho framed him for pushing Kane. On the February 18 episode of ""Raw"", Ziggler was defeated by World Heavyweight Champion Alberto Del Rio by submission in a non-title match, and afterwards Langston attacked Del Rio and then Ziggler made a failed attempt to cash in his Money in the Bank briefcase after Del Rio's ring announcer Ricardo Rodriguez ran off with it.

Ziggler was originally booked to face Del Rio and Swagger in a three-way ladder match at Extreme Rules; however, Ziggler suffered a legitimate concussion at a ""SmackDown"" taping, thus removing their match from the pay-per-view and resulting in Ziggler being absent from television for a month. On June 16 at Payback, Ziggler faced Del Rio in his first title defense of the World Heavyweight Championship and during the match, a double turn took place; Ziggler turned face by displaying a never-say-die attitude while Del Rio turned heel by repeatedly and ruthlessly targeting his head to take advantage of his concussion, win the match, and end Ziggler's reign at 69 days. On July 14 at Money in the Bank, AJ cost Ziggler his title rematch against Alberto Del Rio, after she prematurely snuck into the ring and hit Del Rio with her own title, prompting a disqualification.

"After some time away from TV, Ziggler returned on the August 22 edition of ""SmackDown Live"" to declare that he would undergo a gimmick change on the following week's edition. He later started mocking, week after week, the entrances of current and former wrestlers such as John Cena, Naomi, Shawn Michaels and Randy Savage. Ziggler believed that fans only cared about elaborated entrances, and not about the in-ring performances, where he claimed he was the best. However, after mocking The Undertaker's entrance, Ziggler was interrupted by Bobby Roode, who challenged Ziggler to a match at Hell in a Cell, which Ziggler accepted. At the event, Ziggler seemed to enter with his usual music and Titantron graphics, but the music was scratched off and the graphics turned off, and he simply entered with no music or Titantron (like a wrestler in the 1980s or prior).

A week later, general manager Daniel Bryan said that Ziggler was nowhere to be found and had indeed vacated his title, so that a tournament to crown a new champion would be held (which was won by Bobby Roode)."
"Ziggler returned at the Royal Rumble on January 28, 2018, as the surprise #30 entrant in the men's Royal Rumble match. After eliminating Goldust, however, Ziggler was eliminated by Finn Bálor. After the February 6 episode of ""SmackDown"", Commissioner Shane McMahon announced on Twitter that the winner of a match between Ziggler and Baron Corbin the following week would be added to the WWE championship match to make it a fatal four-way at Fastlane. Before that match started, Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn attacked Corbin in the backstage area and later went after Ziggler to prevent either from being added. In response, Shane scheduled Owens to face Corbin and Zayn to face Ziggler with both Corbin and Ziggler being added if they won their respective matches, while also threatening that if Owens or Zayn interfered in the other's match, that person would be removed from the title match. Corbin and Ziggler won their respective matches, thus making it a fatal five-way for the WWE Championship at Fastlane.
